To prevent and to intervene, however, one must predict. To predict the natural course of a system in the absence of intervention and to predict what is going to happen to such a system after the proposed intervention. Prediction, on its side, is strongly dependent on the scientific foundations of the subject in question. In this sense, mathematical models have provided a precise template against which new observations or theories can be tested as understanding of the phenomenon develops [1].",

In addition to these three aims of modelling we propose a fourth objective: the generation of testable hypotheses by providing a theoretical framework on which plausible scenarios can be simulated in a computer environment (in silico experiments).",

For instance, by projecting what would happen with a given population if individuals were not vaccinated, it is possible to quantify the relative impact of a specific vaccination program.",

For this, we begin by fitting an exponential curve to the initial growing phase of the number of human cases of SARS, Y(t)(3)Y(t)=Y0exp[(R0-1)t].Having R\n0 it is possible to estimate the contact rate, \u03b2, the most difficult parameter to be obtained from epidemiological field research, through the relation(4)\u03b2=R0(\u03bc+\u03b3+\u03b1).\n",

By contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada).

This simplification may overestimate the projections of the natural course of the epidemics. However, the qualitative results are not affected, that is, by introducing in the model the parameter \u03ba in Eq. (5), which reduced the contact rate, we were able to reproduce the change in the natural impetus of the epidemics. The second constraint of the model is the deterministic nature of the model, that is, we considered only the average values of each variable and parameter (the mean field approach).

The test consisted in reproducing the course of the epidemic along its temporal evolution by mimicking the contact reduction in the parameter \u03b2, as compared with the absence of intervention. The model reproduces the temporal evolution of the epidemics with good accuracy and suggests what would have happen if the control measures were not implemented. Therefore, our model is not a forecasting model but rather a projection one. This distinction is an important one, in particular concerning the concept of validation. Forecasting models can be tested by comparing their predictions with actual data. Projection models should be seen in a counterfactual way, that is, their projections cannot be tested because they will never happen. The main purpose of projection models is, therefore, to provide support by plausible hypotheses on the efficacy of intervention policies. This is the role of the present model, to provide support to the hypothesis that simple control procedures interrupted the transmission chain of the SARS virus in the areas analysed.",

We suggest that it was probably due to a relaxing of public health measures (\u03b2 immediately returned to \u03b2\n0), which were promptly corrected with a greater rigour than that applied during the first outbreak (\u03ba increased 30-fold). This phenomenon can be seen in the curves of Fig. 3, which display the time evolution of the number of secondary cases. As mentioned above, this number starts with the basic reproduction number, R\n0, dropping according with the reduction in the proportion of susceptibles and, in our case, also with the reduction in the contact parameter \u03b2.",

However, super spreading events are suspected to have a pivotal role in the global spread of SARS [21], [22], [23]. In fact, it is suspected to have played major roles in epidemics of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada). Therefore, it is possible that our projections of the size of those epidemics can be overestimated since we assumed homogenously mixing and our calculations could not be generalized for the entire population of those communities due to the heterogeneity in spreading potential of the affected clusters of individuals.",
