However, I suspect that even those of us trained in epidemiology would have trouble in coming up with something much better, or at least good enough to put one's mind at ease. Adding to the challenge is the language used by our health officials. For example, on 30 January 2020 the WHO designated the virus a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\". To the lay public, terms such as \"emergency\"",

That part of the definition does not stipulate what is the threshold of risk, nor does it indicate how many States must be at such risk. Influenza would meet that criteria, and yet, it typically does not merit the designation (the 2009 H1N1 outbreak is one exception). The reason for the general exclusion of influenza is found in the latter part of the definition-that is, \"serious, unusual, or unexpected\". Certainly, the common flu is serious, as it causes significant morbidity and mortality around the world each year. However, it is not \"unusual\" or \"unexpected\". That distinction raises another issue in how to interpret the designation. \"Serious\", \"usual\", and \"unexpected\" are not synonymous.",

The question is can something warrant risk to other States through international spread and not be \"serious\"? I suppose that depends on how one defines serious-something that I suspect differs between individuals and between lay people and experts. A second necessary criteria is that the disease (potentially) requires a coordinated action from the international community. Presumably, that could range from simply sharing data, to sharing and redistributing A similar statement was issued by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): \"The immediate risk of being exposed to this virus is still low for most Americans, but as the outbreak expands, that risk will increase.\" What does \"low\" risk mean?",

For example, the range of probabilities assigned by participants to terms that might be associated with \"low\", such as \"somewhat unlikely\", \"very unlikely\", and \"seldom\", include estimates as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.8. It has also been shown that experts can have a very different impression of risks than do lay people. 2 Classic research on risk perception shows that there is a tendency to overestimate risk when outcomes are dreadful or impact a lot of people in a short period of time (eg, catastrophic events) or when we feel a lack of control. 3 I suspect that a pandemic certainly fits that criteria in the eyes of many. Thus, it is not surprising that some would overreact, nor is it surprising that some would not take the issue seriously.",

However, we do not know the true denominator, as there is a higher probability of being tested if your symptoms are severe. Thus, it is likely the risk of fatality is lower, but how low is anyone's guess (it depends on the validity of the assumptions in your model). The infection rate is also difficult to understand. China has a population of 1.4 billion people and has recorded approximately 80 000 confirmed cases. That would put the risk of infection at 1 in 17 500. We know that is certainly incorrect, given that again (a) we do not know how many people were actually infected-many have mild symptoms and/or do not get tested, and (b) the excellent response in China to reducing the spread of infection through the implementation of testing, tracing, and quarantine and other social distancing measures. We also need to consider contextual differences, such as population density, demographics, health care resources, cultural practises, etc., that complicate the extrapolation of experience from setting to another.",

That means we may need to rely on the judgement of experts, such as those with knowledge of infectious disease and public health. On the other hand, we must be very careful in how we formulate messages to the public so as to avoid inducing an over-reaction or complacency. So what are we to tell people when they ask about their risk and are seeking advice on if they should go to work, be with friends, etc.? To tell them that there is nothing to worry about is not only incorrect, but it damages trust in science, especially if things turn out differently than what the experts are predicting (which will likely be the case, as their models are not perfect, but hopefully any error ends up in our favour). Nor is it correct to tell them that the situation is dire, as it is not clear how many people in their community will ultimately suffer. My personal belief is that we must be realistic in regards to what we know and that it is always best to be honest about that. What is wrong with simply saying that we do not know what is going to happen, but we know that there are certain activities that will mitigate risk, and it is best to err on the side of caution? That might not be a satisfying answer, but it is better than telling people to stock up on water and toilet paper, which seems to be what people are telling each other. ",
