Therefore, there is currently a lack of pathologic data about its effects in intubated patients.

However, in case of persistent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy and bleb resection may be a feasible option to reduce air leak and improve ventilation. We report the cases of two COVID-19 patients successfully treated with thoracoscopy, bleb resection, and pleurectomy for persistent pneumothorax.",

In this setting, fibrotic parenchyma and pre-existing emphysematous blebs are prone to rupture with consequent risk of pneumothorax. Chest drains may be required however, in case of persistent air leak minimally invasive thoracoscopy with blebs resection may be indicated.",

It has been shown that iatrogenic pneumothorax occurs mostly in patients with an underlying lung diseases (i.e. COPD, ARDS, etc.) during the early phase of intubation [6] . As described for ARDS, lungs of COVID-19 patients with significant interstitial involvement, seem physiologically small with low compliance and reduced elastance.

While chest tube placement should be considered as first line treatment, the persistence of air leak may constitute indication for low tidal volume two-lung ventilation thoracoscopy [7] [8] . The procedure timing is unclear and was discussed multidisciplinary. In the first case, after chest tube placement, a wait-and-see strategy was preferred because doubts about the real effectiveness of the procedure. In the second case, a more aggressive and earlier operative attempt was planned. Although the procedure was successful in both, because the feeling of a stiffer parenchyma black cartridges were used for resection in the first case. Hence, we believe that early indication for thoracoscopy may be presumably better because the less traumatized, fibrotic, and inflamed interstitial tissues.",
