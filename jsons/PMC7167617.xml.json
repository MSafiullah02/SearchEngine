JEV infection involves the nervous system, for example, basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and thalamus 3, 4, 5.

Mature viral proteins arise from proteolytic processing of this single polyprotein by viral NS2B\u2010NS3 and variant cellular proteases 2. NS5, multifunctional protein containing RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase activity, is involved in viral RNA replication 8. Short hairpin RNA targeting JEV NS5 gene reduces levels of viral RNA genome and proteins, specifically and efficiently inhibiting JEV replication 9. JEV NS5 protein suppresses STAT1 nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 and SATA1 that arise in response to IFN by blocking IFN\u2010stimulated (where IFN is interferon) JAK\u2010STAT signaling 10. WNV NS5 protein prevents phosphorylated STAT1 accumulation and blocks IFN\u2010dependent gene expression, then rescues growth of a highly IFN\u2010sensitive virus in the presence of IFN treatment 11. DEN NS5 inhibits IFN\u2010alpha, not IFN\u2010gamma, signaling via binding with and blocking phosphorylation of STAT2 12, 13.

Calcineurin\u2010dependent expression of IL\u20104 was tested in NS5\u2010expressing and vector control cells (Fig. 7D). Due to calcineurin activation by JEV NS5 (Figs. 5 and 6), relative IL\u20104 mRNA level in NS5\u2010expressing cells was nearly 50% higher than vector controls in response to IFN\u03b2 (Fig. 7D). siRNA silencing of calcineurin significantly decreased IL\u20104 mRNA in both types of cells, even stimulated with IFN\u03b2.

Calreticulin was downregulated in infected cells by viral dose\u2010dependent manner, correlating with downregulation of calreticulin by NS5 protein.

Single treatment of CsA (1000 ng/mL) significantly reduced JEV plaque titers by 4.3\u2010fold 48 h post infection; single treatment of IFN\u03b2 (500 U/mL) significantly reduced JEV plaque titers by 24.0\u2010fold 48 h post infection. Combined treatment of CspA and IFN\u03b2 potently inhibited JEV plaque titers by 63.4\u2010fold at 48 h post infection. Annexin V\u2010FITC/propidium iodide apoptosis staining indicated ratio of late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Annexin V\u2010FITC positive/propidium iodide positive) at 48 h post infection as 3.2% in mock controls, 28.7% in JEV\u2010infected cells, 13.2% in infected cells with single IFN\u03b2 treatment, 11.1% in infected cells treated with single CsA, and 6.5% in those treated with both CsA and IFN\u03b2 (Fig. 8C).

Among upregulated proteins, cyclophilin A is involved in virus replication and virion maturation 39, significantly interacting with calcineurin and inhibited its phosphatase activity in the presence of CsA 40, 41. Hsp60 is one calcineurin\u2010interacting protein 42. STIP1, an Hsp70/ Hsp90\u2010organizing protein, as a cochaperone binds to both Hsp70/Hsp90, correlated with calcineurin regulation 43. SARS\u2010CoV NSP1 overexpression strongly induced production of interleukin 2 by activating calcineurin/NFAT pathway; calcineurin inhibitor CspA strongly inhibited pan\u2010coronavirus replication in vitro 41. Proteomics results and the above literature survey led us to hypothesize calcineurin as involved in Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5. Because induction of ISG15 was IRF\u20103\u2010dependent, PKR expression is STAT1\u2010dependent in response to Type I IFN 33, 34, IFN\u03b2 upregulated expression of ISG15, but not PKR in NS5\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 5C and D), implying NS5 specifically inhibited STAT1\u2010mediated signaling. Combined CsA and IFN\u03b2 treatment as well as siRNA\u2010mediated calcineurin silence restored IFN\u03b2\u2010induced STAT1\u2010mediated responses in NS5\u2010expressing cells, for example., PKR mRNA expression, STAT1 phosphrylation at Tyr701, nuclear translocation of STAT1 (Figs. 5, 6, 7). These affirm Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 correlating with downregulation of calreticulin in which activated Ca2+\u2010dependent calcineurin phosphatase inhibits STAT1\u2010mediated signaling. HBV\u2010induced upregulation of calreticulin was identified as antagonizing Type I IFN responses: inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation and reducing PKR mRNA expression 44.
