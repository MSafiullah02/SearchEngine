It is hypothesized in the literature that\nsmall molecules such as solvents can adsorb onto the fabrics\u2019 fibers\nand either screen or possibly lift the frozen charges of the\nelectret,32 which would decrease the filtration\nefficiency. In the case of disinfection with ethanol-based solutions, recent\npreliminary work also shows that vacuum drying may be able to restore the\nefficiency of FFRs.33 It is also possible that the\nchlorine-based solution may degrade the efficiency less than the\nalcohol-based solution due to the higher water content. As polypropylene is\nhydrophobic, the chlorine-based solution may have a more difficult time\npenetrating the fabric and the static charge of fibers deeper within the\nmeltblown may be less affected.",

The meltblown fabrics after 10 cycles of each treatment\nare summarized in Figure 3 (data\nprovided in Table S1). After three treatments of these three methods,\nthe meltblown fabric still has characteristics similar to the initial\nsample. However, after five steam treatments, the efficiency has a sharp\ndrop which continues at cycle 10 (Table S2). Similar to the alcohol- and chlorine-solution\ntreatments, the pressure drop can be maintained at \u223c8\u20139 Pa,\nbut the efficiency degrades to around \u223c80%, which would be concerning\nin an environment with high viral aerosol concentrations. As with the\nsolution treatments, the pressure drops remained similar, which suggests it\nis also due to the decay of static charge. The dwelling time and frequency\nmay be critical for how well the static charge can be preserved. If steam\ntreatments saturate the fibers many times and condense water droplets on the\nfibers, it is possible that the static charge decays after multiple\ntreatments. Because this decay is due to the direct water molecule contact\nwith the fibers, it may be possible to alleviate the static decay if the\nfibers do not come into contact with the vapor directly (sealed container,\napparatus, bag, etc.) and steam only serves as the heating\nelement.",

There\nis little to no change in the filtration efficiency and pressure drop up to\n100 \u00b0C in low-moisture conditions. However, at 125 \u00b0C, there is a\nsharp drop in the filtration efficiency while maintaining a constant\npressure drop at around cycle 5. Similarly, the lack of pressure drop change\nindicates that the degradation is also due to the static decay. Considering\nthe higher temperature, polypropylene\u2019s melting point (130\u2013170\n\u00b0C), as well as the thin and fibrous nature of the media, it is\npossible that the higher temperature is enough to relax the microscopic\ncharge state within the polymer, resulting in some of the quasi-stable\npolarization to become depolarized to their neutral state. From SEM images,\nwe did not identify any morphological changes and did not observe any\napparent physical deformations (Figure S3), which may support this conclusion. This effect\nis not as strong as direct solvent contact, which reduced the filtration\nefficiency to <80%, whereas 125 \u00b0C reduced the efficiency to\n\u223c90%. The mechanism of efficiency degradation may differ, as the\nsolvent may form molecular adsorption layers or possibly liberate charge\ntraps, but higher temperatures provide energy to return some of the\nfibers\u2019 polarized state to a relaxed state.",

The current shortage of N95 FFRs during this time of rapidly\nspreading infection may be mitigated by methods that will enable their safe\nreuse. We tested methods that may be suitable for the reuse of particulate\nrespirators and hope our results will be useful in helping hospitals, health\ncare facilities, and the public in formulating safe standard operating\nprocedures so that virus inactivation is assured while not compromising mask\nprotection. We reiterate that although these methods were not tested on FFRs\nthat have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, these methods use disinfection\nprecedents set by either SARS-CoV or recent data based on inactivation of\nSARS-CoV-2 in solution. We found that of commonly deployable methods,\nheating (dry or in the presence humidity) <100 \u00b0C can preserve the\nfiltration characteristics of a pristine N95 respirator. The UVGI (254 nm, 8\nW) sterilizer cabinet used in these tests does not have enough dose to\nimpact the filtration properties within a reasonable number of treatment\ncycles and may be considered for disinfection, however the exact dose output\nof the cabinet would need to be determined such that it is suitable for\ninactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal FFR damage. Using steam to disinfect\nrequires caution, as the treatments may seem to be suitable, but prolonged\ntreatment may leave the user with unsuitable protection. Finally, we advise\nagainst liquid contact, such as alcohol solutions, chlorine-based solutions,\nor soaps to clean the respirator, as this will lead to a degradation in the\nstatic charge that is necessary for the FFR to meet the N95 standard.",
