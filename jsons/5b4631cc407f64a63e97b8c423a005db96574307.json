            "text": "35 understanding of the illness. Although Manalo et al. postulate a potential etiology of livedo 36 reticularis in COVID-19 involving low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 37 recent data suggest other mechanisms for vaso-occlusive findings in non-severe infection. DIC is 38 much less common in those with mild COVID-19 infection, affecting only 0.6% of survivors as 39 opposed to 71.4% of non-survivors in one study. 2 Similarly, the majority of reports of large 40 vessel thromboses and microemboli in COVID-19 are in those with severe illness. Supporting 41 this observation is a retrospective study demonstrating that thromboprophylaxis has a mortality 42 benefit in only severely ill COVID-19 patients with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score. 3 43 Although studies in mild disease are limited, these combined data suggest that DIC and 44 macrothromboses may be restricted to severe COVID-19 infections. This is not unexpected 45 given that severe infection is accompanied by features of Virchow's triad including venous stasis 46 in the setting of immobility, hypercoagulability as a result of cytokine storm, and endothelial cell 47 dysfunction due to sepsis and inflammation. With this in mind, what then accounts for the vaso-48 occlusive phenomena that preferentially affect cutaneous small vessels in mild cases of COVID-49 19? Based on emerging data, several other potential factors may play a role in microthrombi 50 formation in less severe disease. 51 Inflammation commonly predisposes patients to thrombosis. As demonstrated in a 52 retrospective study, severe COVID-19 patients have high levels of inflammatory cytokines 53 including IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-9, IFN-\u0263, and TNF-\u03b1 among others. Although less profoundly elevated 54 than in severe illness, levels remain moderately elevated in non-severe disease. allowing entry into the cell. 5 ACE2 binding results in decreased expression of ACE2, 61 activation of the renin-angiotensin system, promotion of platelet aggregation, and thrombus 62 formation. Because endothelial cells also express ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 may additionally cause 63 direct endothelial dysfunction after binding to ACE2, leading to subsequent thrombosis. 64 In the setting of mild disease where profound coagulopathy is unlikely, mild elevations in 65 prothrombotic cytokines and direct endothelial cell damage by SARS-COV-2 may theoretically 66 contribute to the small vessel occlusive phenomena noted in the skin. Other potential 67 mechanisms include complement activation, antiphospholipid antibody production, and tissue 68 factor expression on endothelial cells. The balance between coagulation cascade activation and 69 fibrinolysis in COVID-19 patients is complex, and further studies may elucidate this delicate tug-70of-war.
