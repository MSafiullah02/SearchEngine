Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic mAb cocktail against Ebola virus. We systematically analyzed the antibody repertoire in human survivors and identified a pair of potently neutralizing mAbs that cooperatively bound to the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). High-resolution structures revealed that in a twoantibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions. Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520. Remodeling of the glycan cap structures by the cocktail enabled enhanced GP binding and virus neutralization. The cocktail demonstrated resistance to virus escape and protected non-human primates (NHPs) against Ebola virus disease.

Potent neutralization, broad reactivity, and protective capacity are desirable mAb features, which could be used to select leads for development as a monotherapy or cocktail. A cocktail might offer greater efficacy and resistance to viral escape (Corti et al., 2016; Keeffe et al., 2018; Wec et al., 2019) , but the molecular and structural basis for the optimal combination of mAbs is ill-defined. Current mAb discovery approaches typically are focused on antibody variable fragment (Fv)-region-mediated biological functions of single isolated mAbs (e.g., binding and neutralization) or Fc-region-mediated effector functions (Walker and Burton, 2018) . Molecular interactions in which two or more mAbs recognize the same antigen in an enhanced (e.g., cooperative or synergistic) fashion are less well investigated, but these interactions might contribute greatly to the overall efficacy of protective cocktails (Carlsen et al., 2014; Doria-Rose et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2017; Mascola et al., 1997) . One key challenge that impedes progress in this area is that the structural determinants of cooperativity by neutralizing antibodies are poorly understood. Development of synergistic mAb cocktails against viruses with high antigenic variability, including HIV, hepatitis C, norovirus, influenza virus, or Ebola virus, is also thwarted by the fact that only a small subset of virus-specific mAbs available for incorporation in cocktails is broadly crossreactive to all field strains. Another challenge is the relatively small number of mAb combinations that can be tested iteratively for therapeutic efficacy given the high cost and labor of in vivo virus challenge studies, especially when non-human primate (NHP) large animal model testing is needed. Therefore, for the rational development of antiviral therapeutic mAb cocktails it is important to implement approaches to identify combinations of mAbs with optimized molecular interactions in formulated cocktails, along with structural and functional analysis to define features that mediate efficient protection by these mAbs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 152, "text": "(Crowe, 2017;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 153, "end": 169, "text": "Lu et al., 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 418, "end": 438, "text": "(Corti et al., 2016;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 439, "end": 459, "text": "Keeffe et al., 2018;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 460, "end": 477, "text": "Wec et al., 2019)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 798, "end": 823, "text": "(Walker and Burton, 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1106, "text": "(Carlsen et al., 2014;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1131, "text": "Doria-Rose et al., 2012;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1152, "text": "Howell et al., 2017;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1174, "text": "Mascola et al., 1997)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In this study, we describe the design of a cooperative twoantibody cocktail possessing neutralizing activity against the primary ebolaviruses that are responsible for outbreaks in humans-Ebola (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Sudan (SUDV) viruses (Kuhn, 2017) .

The glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 bound moderately and less efficiently to intact cell-surface-displayed GPs when compared with its binding to recombinant GPs ( Figures 1C and S1B ). Together, these results defined binding and functional features of the cocktail candidate mAbs and showed that the exposure of rEBOV-520 epitope is limited on the intact GPs of all three ebolaviruses. mAbs in the Cocktail Cooperate, Enabling Enhanced GP Binding, Virus Neutralization, and In Vivo Protection Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis showed that rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 can bind to GPs simultaneously ( Figure 2A ). To characterize the cooperative effects of these two mAbs as a cocktail, we first assessed GP binding for each mAb in the presence or absence of the partner mAb. Fluorescently labeled rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 was titrated into a constant concentration of unlabeled partner mAb, as previously described (Gilchuk et al., 2018) , and relative fluorescence from binding of the labeled mAb to the intact cell-surface-displayed EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GP was determined. At a constant concentration of 20 mg/mL, rEBOV-548 enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to the GPs of all three ebolaviruses 2-to 3-fold when compared with binding of rEBOV-520 alone. The cooperativity was mediated by rEBOV-548, because rEBOV-520 had a minor effect on binding of rEBOV-548 to the GP ( Figure 2B ). Cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact homologous EBOV GP increased steadily with increased concentrations of rEBOV-548 and up to $5-fold higher than rEBOV-520 alone (Figure 2C) , indicating that a higher dose of rEBOV-548 would be necessary to leverage strong cooperative effect in a two-antibody cocktail. Binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact GP in the cocktail did not fully match the strong saturating binding of rEBOV-520 by itself to the proteolytically primed GP CL (Figure 2C) . Therefore, binding of rEBOV-548 only partially enhanced accessibility of the base epitope on the intact GP for recognition by rEBOV-520, compared with the accessibility to the epitope on GP CL . We next assessed whether cooperative binding conferred an enhanced neutralizing activity to the cocktail by using first the most antigenically divergent virus, SUDV. rEBOV-548 itself did not fully neutralize SUDV, and rEBOV-520 neutralized SUDV, but with modest potency ( Figure 1B and S1A). Consistent with the observed increase in cooperative binding of the SUDV GP ( Figure S2A ), rEBOV-548 at a sub-neutralizing concentration potentiated the neutralizing activity of rEBOV-520 against chimeric virus displaying the SUDV GP by reducing the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value by $3-fold ( Figure 2D ). Neutralization by the cocktail was synergistic, as determined by the Chou and Talalay method that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination: additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI >1) (Chou, 2010) . We also demonstrated synergy in neutralization of the virus with the homologous EBOV GP using the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) ( Figures  S2B and S2C ).

These data strongly suggest that the use of this cocktail enhances the effective neutralizing potency of the mAbs and counteracts virus escape of the homologous EBOV. Although escape was not detected with the cocktail, the rEBOV-520 escape mutant we identified for rVSV/SUDV GP (N514Y, a conserved residue for EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP) was not fully neutralized by either mAb rEBOV-548 alone or by the cocktail, suggesting the possibility of escape by the heterologous SUDV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 647, "text": "Figures S2D and S2E", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1486, "text": "(Table S2)", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 2331, "end": 2340, "text": "Figure S2", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2354, "text": "Table S2.", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 2721, "end": 2732, "text": "(Table  S2)", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}], "section": "Identification and Functional Properties of Candidate Cocktail Human mAbs"}, {"text": "Therefore, cooperativity in GP binding by the cocktail could benefit therapeutic effectiveness by enhancing virus neutralization, enhancing in vivo protection, and reducing the risk of virus escape.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Identification and Functional Properties of Candidate Cocktail Human mAbs"}, {"text": "The Cocktail mAbs Recognize Relatively Conserved Epitopes of Two Major Antigenic Sites of the GP We previously reported negative stain EM reconstructions of EBOV-520 in complex with the GP (Gilchuk et al., 2018) .

The rE-BOV-520 footprint includes relatively conserved regions including the internal fusion loop (IFL) stem of the GP2 subunit and the hydrophobic pocket formed by five residues of the GP1 subunit and termed previously the ''3 10 '' pocket (Zhao et al., 2016; West et al., 2019) . The footprint of rEBOV-520 is distinct from that of the previously described broad human base-specific mAb ADI-15878 (Murin et al., 2018; West et al., 2018) but is similar to the footprint of the potent human-base-specific mAb ADI-15946 ( Figure 3D ), which fully neutralizes EBOV and BDBV but not SUDV (Wec et al., 2017; West et al., 2019) . Both ADI-15946 and rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket and IFL stem regions of the fusion loop, unlike human mAb ADI-15878, which binds to the hydrophobic loop end of the structure and bridges to a neighboring GP protomer (King et al., 2019) . However, rEBOV-520 likely gained reactivity against SUDV by having a footprint slightly higher on the GP base than the ADI-15946, or a different angle of approach than that of ADI-15946, which was directed downward toward the viral membrane ( Figure 3C ), in contrast to ADI-15946, which is directed upward from the membrane (West et al., 2019) . This footprint allowed the mAb to avoid contact with the non-conserved EBOV GP residue N506 (R506 in SUDV GP) in the interface with rEBOV-520 ( Figure 3D )-a key contact residue for binding with complementarity determining region 3 of heavy chain (CDRH3) of ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019) .

The 18-amino-acid-long CDRH3 interacted with a conformational epitope on the GP1-GP2 interface by making direct contacts with 13 GP1 (aa 70-78, 106, 107, 127, and 139) and 5 GP2 (aa 510-514) residues that are relatively conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV ( Figure S3A ). rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket of the GP CL formed by GP1 residues 70-78 (all contacted with CDRH3) and GP2 residues 510-516 (four of seven contacted with CDRH3) that line the bottom part of the pocket ( Figure 4A ). In the unbound, full-length GP, the 3 10 pocket normally is occupied by the flexible descending b17-b18 loop of the glycan cap (GP1 residues 287-291) that impedes access to the pocket. Like ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019), rEBOV-520 either bound to a conformation of GP in which the b17-b18 loop is displaced, or actively displaced it from the pocket upon binding. The loop is not present in the GP CL , being removed by cleavage. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to compare deuterium labeling of peptides generated after digestion of the GP and GP CL with pepsin. Decrease in labeling of GP 3 10 pocket residues involved in the interface with CDRH3 confirmed limited accessibility of rEBOV-520 epitope in a structure of intact GP trimer ( Figure 4A and S3B). Cleavage removes the glycan cap with the b17-b18 loop and exposes the pocket, which explained enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to GP CL ( Figure 1C ) and enhanced neutralization potency of this mAb against virions bearing the GP CL compared with intact GP (Gilchuk et al., 2018) . Previous work suggested that binding of the non-neutralizing macaque mAb FVM09 to the b17-b18 loop itself displaces the loop causing unmasking of the neutralizing epitopes for mAbs 2G4 and ADI-15946 on the GP base (Howell et al., 2017; West et al., 2019).

Instead, the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 directly interacted with the b17 strand (residues 272-275) of GP1, forming an extended beta sheet with the glycan cap, including highly conserved critical epitope residues I274 and W275 that were defined by loss of binding with alanine substitution and L273, for which mutation to proline resulted in loss of neutralizing activity. rEBOV-548, similarly to EBOV-442, inhibited glycan cap cleavage, which could be the molecular basis for neutralizing activity by these mAbs (Gilchuk et al., 2018) . Two non-conserved GP1 residues Y261 and R266, whose mutation to alanine decreased binding of rEBOV-548 ( Figure 3B ), did not directly contact the rEBOV-548 paratope and were not within the cleavage site. In the SUDV GP, natural mutations Y261H and R266L affected rEBOV-548 activity in a similar way by lowering the EC 50 for binding and reducing its neutralizing potency (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B), suggesting destabilization of the epitope by these adjacent mutations. In both rEBOV-548 Fab alone and rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 Fab bound states, the b18-b18 0 domain, C-terminal of the GP b17-b18 loop was displaced and structurally mimicked by the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 ( Figures 5B and S4 ). The rE-BOV-548 LC contacted GP1 through hydrophobic interactions at the loop between a1 and b17 (residues 268 and 269) and through Q27 L1 contacting residue D117, making a possible H-bond with the backbone of D117 ( Figure 5C ) that anchors the mAb to the inner chalice of the GP ( Figure 5A ). We observed rEBOV-548-mediated destabilization and dissociation of the GP trimer ( Figure S5A ). Such a dissociation was limited in the presence of the stalk-specific mAb ADI-16061 that was used to stabilize the GP for cryo-EM with rEBOV-548. It is unclear whether this disruption seen with soluble GPs also occurs in membrane-anchored GPs or whether it contributes to the synergy. Analysis of rEBOV-520 interactions in the structure of rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 bound to the GP showed that the rEBOV-520 CDRH3 loop makes additional contacts beyond the 3 10 pocket when the glycan cap is intact.

The rEBOV-520 CDRH3 residue W100 H3 bound to N512 in GP2, displacing the b17-b18 loop and mimicking the N512 interaction with W291 GP1 of the b17-b18 loop in the unliganded structure ( Figure 5D ). Residues T77, K510, and N512 were highly conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs. Of note, our previous study identified N512 as a key epitope residue for rEBOV-520, given that N512A mutation reduced binding to the GP (Gilchuk et al., 2018) . Therefore, for efficient binding rEBOV-520 must overcome interference of the b17-b18 loop (at W291 GP1 ) and a1 helix (at P250 GP1 ) contained in the glycan cap structure ( Figure 5E ). When two Fabs of the cocktail bound to the GP, the b18-b18 0 region is displaced and the glycan cap pulled back, along with the b17-b18 loop, to allow efficient binding of rEBOV-520 ( Figure 5F ). However, in a structure where rEBOV-548 bound to the GP alone, the glycan cap was not displaced to the degree it was when rEBOV-520 was bound but rather is reminiscent of the structure of unliganded GP. Although the b18 and b18 0 strands are displaced and replaced by rEBOV-548 CDRH3, the b17-b18 loop is largely intact and bound to the base of the IFL, blocking the 3 10 pocket ( Figure S4 ). Comparing solvent exclusion, the unliganded GP and the GP in a complex with rEBOV-548 alone appeared very similar, except for in the b18-b18 0 domain. Most of the region where the rEBOV-520 CDR3 bound was still excluded and the a1 helix was not displaced ( Figure S5B ), consistent with our observation that rEBOV-548 did not fully potentiate binding of rEBOV-520. These data suggested that in the cocktail, rEBOV-520 alone was largely responsible for complete displacement of the b17-b18 loop as well as displacing the a1 helix in the cocktail, whereas rEBOV-548 acted by displacement of the b18-b18 0 domain and the C-terminal portion of the b17-b18 loop, alleviating structural and kinetic restraints for efficient rEBOV-520 binding ( Figure S6 ). We concluded that structural remodeling is the principal mechanism for the enhanced GP binding and ebolavirus neutralization by the cocktail of two cooperative, naturally occurring human mAbs rEBOV-548 and rEBOV-520 (Figures 5G, 5H, and S6; Video S1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1025, "end": 1047, "text": "(Gilchuk et al., 2018)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 793, "end": 802, "text": "Figure 5D", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1232, "text": "Figure 5E", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1429, "text": "Figure 5F", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1823, "text": "Figure S4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2094, "text": "Figure S5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2574, "text": "Figure S6", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "Identification and Functional Properties of Candidate Cocktail Human mAbs"}, {"text": "Analysis of the molecular interaction between rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 with the GP illustrated that both mAbs use molecular mimicry whereby CDRH3 binds to the GP in a manner analogous to the interactions in the unliganded GP.

After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Kikwit variant of EBOV, all NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail (1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) spaced 3 days apart (days 3 and 6 after infection). An additional animal was studied as a contemporaneous control and was left untreated, along with ten historical untreated controls (7 days post-infection [dpi] median survival, inoculated by the same route with the same stock of virus). The control untreated animal developed a high clinical score and succumbed to the disease on day 6 after infection. The two-dose therapeutic cocktail treatment provided complete protection of NHPs from mortality and clinical signs of EVD (Figures 7A, 7B, and S7). Before the first treatment (day 3 after infection) three of five NHPs from the treatment-designated group and also the control untreated NHP developed detectable viremia; plasma titers ranged from 6.7 log 10 to 7.3 log 10 genome equivalents (GEQs) per mL, as measured by qRT-PCR ( Figure 7C ). The plasma titer of infectious virus that was assessed by plaque assay on day 3 after infection was below the limit of detection in all animals. However, by day 6 after infection, the viral load in all untreated animals, including in the NHP control from this study and in the historical controls, was as high as >5 log 10 PFU/mL or >11 log 10 GEQ/ mL (Figures 7C and S7) . Concordant with full protection, by day 6 after infection all treated NHPs, including three registered as highly viremic on day 3 after infection, no longer had detectable viremia in the plasma. In various tissues harvested from treated animals on day 28 after infection, qRT-PCR analysis, which detects both infectious and non-infectious neutralized particles that have not yet been cleared, revealed virus, confirming active EBOV infection in all NHPs in the treatment group before treatment (Table S5) . We next assessed changes in blood chemistries that are typically associated with EVD to further characterize the efficacy of the mAb cocktail treatment (Table S6 ).

MBP134 AF is a two-antibody cocktail with pan-ebolavirus activity that demonstrated efficacy in NHPs (Bornholdt et al., 2019). REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail (Pascal et al., 2018) , and mAb114 is a single mAb that is specific to the receptor binding site of the GP (Corti et al., 2016a)-both are monospecific to EBOV. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 were recently assessed in the field in the DRC outbreak of human EVD, and early treatment was associated with reduction of the mortality rate to 6% with REGN-EB3 or to 11% with mAb114 (Nature News, 2019). mAb114 is the only EBOV antibody described that has been shown so far to protect NHPs in monotherapy settings. Even so, the protection mediated by the cocktail of mAb114 + mAb100 was better than that mediated by mAb114 alone (Corti et al., 2016a) . In the cocktail, there is also the potential benefit of avoiding the high risk of virus escape that is inherent in monotherapy approaches. Targeting cross-reactive epitopes might be another approach to reduce the viral escape, given that conserved regions are more likely to be critical for the virus function. Therefore, having a single broad cocktail that is at least as effective as the existing monospecific cock-tail against EBOV would be practical. The cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 was formulated to add a principle of cooperativity (e.g., incorporation of a pair of non-competing and potently neutralizing mAbs that together exhibit an enhanced activity). Therefore, in addition to the reactivity breadth that extended to BDBV and SUDV, the cocktail of rE-BOV-520 and rEBOV-548 incorporated four principal activities against homologous EBOV: the independent neutralizing activities of (1) rEBOV-520 and (2) rEBOV-548, (3) an enhanced combined activity because of synergy in the cocktail, and (4) Fc-mediated effector function by rEBOV-548. A comparison to the historical NHPs studies with REGN-EB3, mAb114, and MBP134 AF qualifies the cocktail of EBOV-520 and EBOV-548 as highly protective against EBOV.
