It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality mainly due to severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Cardiac manifestations related to COVID-19 include demand ischemia, fulminant myocarditis, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. In this report, we present a case of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a 68-year-old man with COVID-19 who initially presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. Patient's STEMI was managed with pharmaco-invasive strategy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). He then developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure that was managed in the intensive care unit (ICU), together with multi-organ failure from which the patient died 2 days after presentation. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms of STEMI in COVID-19 patients has not been clearly established, we hypothesize that interrelated pathogenetic factors, that we highlight in this report, can play a role in the development of STEMI, including plaque rupture secondary to systemic inflammation, increased pro-coagulants, endothelial dysfunction, impaired fibrinolysis and impaired oxygen utilization leading to demand/supply mismatch and myocardial ischemia.

            "text": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since its discovery in Wuhan, China in late 2019. It is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a single stranded enveloped RNA virus. [1] Infection occurs by the binding of the virus spike protein to the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. [4] ACE 2 is found in the type II pneumocyte in the lung, which is theorized to be the main point of entry of the virus. The ACE2 Receptor is also found in the heart, where it antagonizes the effects of angiotensin 2 in diseases where neurohormonal dysregulation is present. [5] [6] . This explains the observation of various studies done, which show that most of the clinical manifestations from COVID-19 infection are respiratory in nature, although severe cardiovascular events have been reported in the literature. [7] In a cohort study of 416 patients who tested positive for COVID, Shi et al. [3] described evidence of myocardial injury in 82 patients (19.7%), as evidenced by elevated high sensitivity troponin I (TnI) levels. These patients had a significantly elevated in-hospital mortality rate (42 of 82 [51.2%]) compared to those who did not have biochemical evidence of myocardial injury (15 of 335 [4.5%] ). In the group with myocardial injury, greater degrees of troponin elevation were associated with increased mortality.",

A significant difference within in-hospital mortality for patients with elevated troponin T levels (59.6%) as compared with patients with normal TnT (8.9%). The highest mortality rate was observed in the cohort with pre-existing cardiac disease and elevated troponin (25 of 36 [69.4%]). It was also found that elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and N-terminalpro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were linked with elevated troponin t levels, suggesting a close interaction between inflammation and myocardial stress. [2] Studies from previous influenza and coronavirus epidemics have shown an association with viral infections and adverse cardiac outcomes, including acute coronary syndromes [8] , arrhythmias [9] and exacerbation of heart failure [10] . The mechanism of myocardial injury during COVID-19 infection has been theorized to be multifactorial. Direct toxicity of the virus to cardiac myocytes, systemic inflammatory responses, destabilization of pre-existing coronary plaque and aggravated hypoxia are some of the predominating ideas behind mechanism of injury. [2] It can be extrapolated that diffuse endothelial injury and impaired fibrinolysis are likely additional factors. Impaired myocardial oxygen utilization in the setting of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels may further contribute to cardiac ischemia.",

Wang YD, et al [11] describes two cases of COVID-19 infection complicated by DIC. Acute myocardial infarction can be attributed to DIC, due to dysregulation and dysfunction in the coagulation cascade. [12, 13] Coagulopathy has also been seen in the dysregulated immune state seen in severe COVID-19 infections. Currently, early stage observation studies have shown some benefit in anticoagulation with heparin. [14, 15] (Figure 3 ).",
