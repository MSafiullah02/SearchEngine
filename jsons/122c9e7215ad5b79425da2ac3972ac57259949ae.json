            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect millions of people worldwide. In order to curb its spread and reduce morbidity and mortality, it is essential to develop sensitive and quantitative methods that identify infected individuals and enable accurate population-wide screening of both past and present infection. Here we show that Single Molecule Array assays detect seroconversion in COVID-19 patients as soon as one day after symptom onset using less than a microliter of blood. This multiplexed assay format allows us to quantitate IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins against four SARS-CoV-2 targets, thereby interrogating 12 antibody isotype-viral protein interactions to give a high resolution profile of the immune response. Using a cohort of samples collected prior to the outbreak as well as samples collected during the pandemic, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection, and 100% sensitivity and specificity thereafter. This assay should become the gold standard for COVID19 serological profiling and will be a valuable tool for answering important questions about the heterogeneity of clinical presentation seen in the ongoing pandemic.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is a novel betacoronavirus that has caused the coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) [1] [2] [3] . In order to identify infected individuals and contain the spread of the disease, rapid and accurate population-wide screening is essential. Currently, nucleic acid based tests of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are the primary method used to detect COVID-19 infected individuals 2 . These tests can only diagnose disease during a narrow window of active infection with an overall clinical sensitivity of 65-72% 4 . Thus, additional diagnostic methods are needed to identify those who are or have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Robust serological assays that can detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can fulfill this critical need. These assays could be used to detect infected individuals who have tested negative by RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays could be used to identify individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, thereby providing a better understanding of how widespread the virus is within a population. This information can aid epidemiologists in determining a more accurate population prevalence of COVID-19.",

A large excess of beads is used compared to the number of immunoglobulin molecules in the sample, such that either zero or one immunoglobulin molecule binds to each bead. After immunoglobulin capture, the beads are incubated with a biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin antibody specific to a single immunoglobulin isotype. Finally, the beads are incubated with the enzyme streptavidin-\u03b2galactosidase (S\u03b2G), which binds to the biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin antibody, forming a complete enzyme-labeled immunocomplex. The beads are then resuspended in resorufin \u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (RGP), a fluorogenic substrate, and loaded onto an array of femtoliter-sized wells in which only one bead fits per well. The wells are sealed with oil and a locally high concentration of the fluorescent product is generated. This enables single molecule detection of immunoglobulins by counting active wells. The ratio of active wells to the total number of beads is determined for each target, and the Average Enzymes per Bead (AEB) is calculated, providing a digital readout for each immunoglobulin isotype against each antigen.",

It will be important to investigate whether using non-heat inactivated plasma or serum can yield higher sensitivity for the IgM assay, potentially leading to improved acute stage diagnosis. In addition, since our assay provides detailed and high-resolution information about the immune response to different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, the assay format should enable us to predict neutralization potential of convalescent plasma.",

This sensitivity increased to 100% and the specificity remained at 100% for COVID-19 positive patients tested one week after symptom onset. This early detection of seroconversion is unmatched by current commercial tests or published laboratory data. Additionally, the resolution of our method enables us to probe small variations in the immune response between patients and within a single patient. The Simoa serological platform provides a powerful analytical tool that will benefit future research in understanding the immune response to COVID-19 by enabling the analysis of antibody response at the early stages of the disease and throughout disease progression with high resolution. A comprehensive analysis of the immune response can provide critical insights necessary for the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",
