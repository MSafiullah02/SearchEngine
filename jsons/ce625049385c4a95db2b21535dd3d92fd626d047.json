            "text": "Since the first case of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 illness 42 was diagnosed in the US on January 20, 2020, 1 a steady stream of new policy measures have 43 been enacted to protect the public from this growing pandemic. At the forefront of these 44 efforts have been measures to limit interpersonal contact to prevent transmission of the virus. 45 Social distancing, school closures and the shuttering of non-essential businesses have already 46 led to significant personal, social and economic hardship. While it has been well publicized that 47 older adults are at highest risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19, 2 they may also be at 48 high risk for negative consequences from the measures being enacted to protect them from the 49 viral threat. Healthcare providers should be aware that their older patients are now particularly 50 vulnerable to social isolation, financial hardship, difficulties accessing needed care and supplies, 51 and anxiety about avoiding COVID-19; the family caregivers these patients often rely on are also 52 vulnerable to increased stress from financial hardships and competing demands on their time. 53 Unfortunately, all of these factors are known to be associated with increased risk of elder abuse 54 for older adults. In this article, we outline how the current pandemic may impact older adults, 55 their caregivers, and the caregiving context to increase elder abuse risk and present 56 interventions for healthcare providers to consider that may help to reduce this risk. 57 An estimated one in ten older adults (age \uf0b360 years) experience elder abuse annually in 58 the US. This includes physical, sexual or psychological abuse, as well as financial exploitation 59 (such as diversion of money without permission or scams) or neglect by caregivers. 3 Even in the 60 best of times, elder abuse cases are rarely detected, with only 1 in 24 cases identified and 61 reported to the appropriate authorities. 4 Elder abuse often results from a combination of 62 factors related to the older adult themselves, caregivers and others in the adult's social circle, 63 3 and the context in which they all live and co-exist. 5 The public policy measures being enacted 64 for COVID-19, and their downstream mental health consequences, are likely having impacts on 65 each of these areas in ways that increase the likelihood of older adults experiencing abuse. 67 For older adults themselves, social isolation is a known risk factor for experiencing elder 68 abuse. 6 The social distancing measures enacted to combat SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and 69 recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for adults over the age of 70 65 to not leave their homes, 7 are undoubtedly creating new degrees of social isolation even 71 amongst those previously well-connected. These limits on in-person contact can greatly limit 5 Contextual factors in which caregiver-care recipient dyads function are also rapidly 107 changing. In addition to competing demands on caregivers' time, many may simply be afraid to 108 spend time in physical contact with an older adult due to concern for contagion. This can 109 inadvertently lead to neglect of older adults. With more limited ability to have in-person 110 contact, many caregivers are trying to use virtual technologies to stay connected with their care 111 recipient. While some older adults may be comfortable with these technologies, many are not, 112 and those with limited financial means may not have the necessary smart phone, computer or 113 high-speed internet to use them. Furthermore, while certain care tasks might be readily 114 replaced by virtual interaction (e.g., medication reminders), many more require in-person 115 contact and may not be carried out during this time, leading to neglect of care that can have 116 significant personal and health consequences. 117 In addition to increased risks for new abusive situations arising, this pandemic may be 118 worsening the severity or lethality of existing abusive relationships. For example, with increases 119 in social distancing, not only was there a rush to buy food and other household products, but 120 there was a substantial increase in the purchase of firearms and ammunition. 14 So, what can we as healthcare providers do? In the face of the many challenges 128 presented by the current COVID-19 crisis, there are also many opportunities. First, as 129 healthcare providers doing telephonic or video visits with our older adult patients, we have a 130 unique chance to observe our patients in their home environment. This is a rare window into 131 how they are living, caring for themselves and being cared for by others. We can systematically 132 observe for signs of unsafe situations, and directly inquire about older adults' safety and well-133 being. For example, we can ask about food insecurity and whether guns in the home are stored 134 safely (locked and unloaded with ammunition stored separately). 15 Second, these visits present 135 opportunities for us to provide support for caregivers, many of whom may not typically attend 136 clinic visits. Caregivers may live with patients, and often help patients connect to phone or 137 video remote visits, especially for the most vulnerable older adult patients (e.g., those with 138 dementia). Caregivers who live apart from patients may find it easier to call into remote visits 139 than they did participating in in-person clinic visits. Caregivers may be more comfortable 140 disclosing sensitive information related to their ability to provide care when speaking from a 141 home environment. Healthcare providers can assess caregiver stress, ability to maintain 142 previous levels of caregiving, and ability to access necessary resources and supplies. Providers 143 can then provide brief counseling, problem-solving strategies, and appropriate referrals. 144 Digital technologies and remote visits also present challenges. For older adults without 145 the financial means or tech savvy, video tele-visits may be unfeasible. Proactive assessment and 146 cataloging of patients' access to the necessary devices and internet or data services to identify 147 those with limitations can allow for alternative strategies with these patients, such as simple 148 telephone visits, or-if having an urgent medical concern-considering the risks and benefits of 149 7 in-person evaluation, either in clinic or via in-home assessment. An additional challenge related 150 to detecting elder abuse is the inability to know reliably when you are evaluating a patient via a 151 virtual-visit if the patient is really alone. While caregiver presence can have benefits as 152 previously discussed, it may also hinder disclosure of abuse or neglect if present. One potential 153 strategy to approaching patients where elder abuse is a concern may be to make an 154 unscheduled call to the older adult, so the caregiver cannot plan ahead to be present. ",

For 157 example, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) has information regarding coping with stress158    and related resources for those individuals concerned about their mental health and well-being 159 during the COVID-19 pandemic.16  The VA is also providing free peer support services via twice 160 weekly phone meetings for any Veteran wanting to talk and receive support from certified Peer161    Specialists during this pandemic. Outside the VA, Kaiser Permanente has launched an 162 innovative \"Food for Life\" program to contact more than 450,000 members in California to163    identify those struggling to pay for food and provide application support to help them apply for164 food benefits. 17 Local Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) are another resource for all health systems, 165 providing a range of services to meet the social needs of older adults, including home-delivered 166 meals, personal care services, health promotion and chronic disease management, 167 transportation, and social engagement. Recent research has shown that older patients benefit 168 when their health systems partner with AAAs, 18 and the new challenges presented by the 169 COVID-19 pandemic present an important opportunity to forge these new partnerships. list resources for patients as well as providers. 20 Some of these resources include 174 links to virtual recovery groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) for those patients interested in 175 receiving support from peers. Familiarizing ourselves with these websites and resources will be 176 important for our patients in the coming weeks and months. In our communities we are seeing 177 an outpouring of support from individuals and organizations reaching out to their older 178 neighbors in caring ways. Encouraging our older patients to forge new bonds being made 179 possible during this pandemic will be more important than ever. We can facilitate older 180 patients connect to neighboring families who can help check on their wellbeing, to volunteers 181 who can pick up needed groceries, 21 and to local organizations that will donate supplies to 182 community older adults, which can help fill in gaps, decrease isolation, also presents an opportunity for research expanding our understanding 185 of elder abuse. Perhaps most understudied, and the area where new revelations could have the 186 biggest impact, are caregiver-related risk factors. With many people experiencing caregiving 187 stress and concern about whether loved ones' needs will be met, caregivers may be more open 188 to participating in research to share their experiences, even uncomfortable ones. Surveys of 189 caregivers of older adults being conducted now in the context of COVID could include questions 190 related to risks of using abusive or neglectful behavior. Other geriatrics and caregiving 191 9researchers should be mindful about the potential increased risk of elder abuse during this 192 time, and could consider incorporating assessments related to this area in their studies.193    Being aware of the challenges older adults and their caregivers are facing is critical to194    helping them survive and thrive during this crisis. Attending to mental health needs, addressing195    increased risks, and connecting older adults to financial and caregiving resources may all help 196 our patients and their loved ones be safer and avoid abusive and violent situations.
