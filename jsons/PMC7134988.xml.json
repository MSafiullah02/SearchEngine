The severity of the ensuing illness and its ready transmissibility severely challenged the medical care systems of affected countries.1, 2, 3, 4 Although much has been learned about SARS since the disease was first identified, many questions are unanswered. It is not yet known, for example, if the disease is seasonal, how it may be transmitted, and why certain individuals are \u201csuperspreaders\u201d of infection.5, 6\n",

As a result of progressive cuts in third-party reimbursement and a shortage of trained staff, US hospitals shed 103,000 staffed hospital beds and 7,800 medical/surgical ICU beds during the decade of the 1990s.28 Fewer beds mean longer waits before unscheduled admissions from the EDs can reach an inpatient unit.19, 20 Boarding of admitted patients in the ED is the factor most commonly associated with crowded conditions and subsequent diversion of inbound ambulances\u2014practices that heighten the risk of disease transmission. These are more than theoretical concerns. When the second victim of SARS in Toronto presented to a hospital for treatment of what was thought at the time to be \u201ccommunity acquired pneumonia,\u201d he was held in the ED for a protracted period of time until an inpatient bed became available.29 During his lengthy ED stay, he infected several patients and members of the hospital staff, some of whom subsequently died.
