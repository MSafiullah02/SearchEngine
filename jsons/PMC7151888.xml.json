Many of these are for surgical, dental and hygiene purposes but some therapeutic agents are also developed for administration by the sublingual or buccal routes. These routes may be selected for substances that are broken down in the stomach or show a rapid first pass effect. As it is technically not feasible to perform full preclinical toxicity studies by the sublingual or buccal routes, conventional oral or parenteral routes are used for systemic toxicity studies on such compounds. The choice of the best route will to a large extent be dictated by pharmacokinetic considerations. However, it is usually deemed necessary to assess local irritancy potential to oral mucosa using a laboratory animal model.",

Gingivitis due to Shigella infections is reported in macaque colonies where intestinal shigellosis is endemic.11 Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis affects the interdental papilla which occurs in primate colonies is strongly suggestive of endemic type D retrovirus infection.11 WBN/Kob rats made severely diabetic with a single dose of alloxan were shown to develop an increase in inflammation in the oral cavity associated with mucosal hyperplasia distributed in the hard palate, central part of tongue and gingiva. The cause was uncertain although alloxan can reduce saliva flow or there may have been an increase in oral commensal microorganisms.12., 13., 14.\n",

Histological examination of teeth from children treated with vincristine or combination chemotherapy for malignant disease has demonstrated prominent incremental lines in dentine correlating with the number of times the intravenous cytotoxic agents were administered.38 These changes can be reproduced in rodents.39 It has been shown that vincristine which interferes with the assembly of microtubules and reduces secretory activity in a number of cells including osteoblasts and chondroblasts alters dentine formation in the rat incisor. Two weeks following a single intravenous dose of vincristine to young adult rats, a faint incremental line in the dentine was shown to occur, probably a reflection of a direct effect of the drug on the dentinogenic tissue at the time of injection.40., 41. At higher doses, focal niche-like or punched-out defects in dentine were also observed, expression of more severe injury to highly sensitive dentinogenic populations at the time of injection. The precise mechanism of damage is not fully understood although decreased secretion of dentine matrix by odontoblasts was demonstrated. Administration of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide or a single exposure to ionizing radiation also produces localized niche-like or punched-out defects in the rat incisor.42., 43.\n",

In children, reported alterations include tooth root resorption, small teeth, delayed shedding of deciduous teeth and retarded eruption of permanent teeth, features similar to those found in hypoparathyroid or pseudohypoparathyroid conditions.44 Tooth root alterations were also reported in a study in which young male Wistar rats were treated with diphenylhyantoin for one month.45 Treated rats showed evidence of molar root resorption lacunae that penetrated the cementum and involved the dentine. The lacunae contained a dense infiltrate of cells contiguous with similar cells in the surrounding periodontal ligament. Changes were similar to those occurring in parathyroidectomized rats but not those in rats made hypocalcemic with a calcium-deficient diet. It has therefore been suggested that the changes induced by diphenylhydantoin in rats are similar to those in pseudohypoparathyroidism in which resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced.45 High circulating levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide has also been shown to disrupt ondontoblastic cell function and normal tooth growth in the rat.46\n",

They range from benign anomalies and cystic structures through to malignant neoplasms. The ameloblastoma comprises cords, nests, anastomosing strands or islands of ondontogenic epithelial cells within a fibrous stroma. The tumor cells resemble ameloblasts with the cords of spindle-shaped cells similar to the stellate epithelium bounded by a peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cells resembling the inner enamel epithelium. Other tumors of the odontogenic epithelium show induction of the mesenchymal elements or develop a complete sequence of odontogenic epithelium, odontogenic mesenchyme and dental hard tissues including dentine, enamel and cementum.

Secretory endpieces are composed of small or moderately sized cells with foamy cytoplasm and basophilic basal poles. The most striking feature is the presence of an additional duct segment interposed between the intercalated and striated ducts. This segment is lined by cylindrical epithelium with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing secretory granules. This duct segment is termed the granular duct or granular convoluted tubule. The granules in these duct cells stain particularly well with the chromotrope-aniline blue stain but also orange G and PAS.96 These granular cells are of special interest because they contain a large number of heterologous biologically active peptides including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, renin, and kallikrinins.97., 98., 99. Epidermal growth factor is secreted in saliva and believed to promote wound healing. However, the precise physiological role of many of these peptides in salivary tissue remains uncertain. Epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from the mouse salivary gland where it was shown to produce premature eyelid opening and incisor eruption when injected into neonates. This led to the isolation not only of epidermal growth factor but also its tyrosine kinase-active receptor.100., 101. Testosterone, thyroxin and growth hormone have been shown to regulate the concentration of epidermal growth factor in the rat submandibular gland.99 Moreover, testosterone is responsible for the male pattern of the gland notably the larger volume of secretory tubules and cytoplasmic granules. Castration causes their regression and androgens their hypertrophy in castrated males and intact females.102 Granular cells stain with antisera for epidermal growth factor.96 The intracellular distribution of epidermal growth factor in acini and ducts has been confirmed in other species including humans.103\n",

In aging BDF1 females the submandibular gland was shown to be involved by a destructive inflammatory process characterized by an intense infiltration by small and medium-sized lymphocytes, associated with mild inflammation in other organs such as the parotid and sublingual glands, pancreas and kidney. Immunocytochemistry showed that most of the lymphocytes were T cells of the helper/inducer subset (CD4 positive) and less than 10% were of suppresser/cytotoxic (CD8 positive) type. Circulating antisalivary duct antibody of IgG was also detected in afflicted mice. It was suggested that helper/inducer T cells played a key role in the production of this change, unlike induced autoimmune sialoadenitis in which cytotoxic T cell subsets may directly destroy glandular tissue. It has been suggested that this process in aging females is related to the decline in the number of suppresser/cytotoxic T cells in mice with advancing age.121\n",

Moreover, it has been shown that Fischer 344, SHR, Lewis and Sprague-Dawley rats differ in their response to the hyperplastic and carcinogenic effects of 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in pelleted diet. The most sensitive appears to be the SHR strain followed by the Fischer 344 rats.

Although it has been demonstrated that butylated hydroxyanisole does not produce hyperplasia in the esophagus of animal species without a forestomach, high doses given to primates are capable of producing an increase in mitotic activity in the lower end of the esophagus similar to that occurring at equivalent exposure levels in the rat forestomach.218 The implication is that these interspecies differences may simply be a question of differences in exposure of the squamous mucosa to compound. This underlines the fact that mechanisms of action and exposure levels of xenobiotics attained in the gastrointestinal tract of rodent and non-rodent species as well as of humans need to be assessed when hyperplasia and neoplasia are induced in the forestomach mucosa of rodents. Such information can clearly be helpful in facilitating decisions made by government\u2019s regulatory authorities in this area.219 However, in the case of butylated hydroxyanisole the evidence suggests that the tumor development in rodents represents an epigenetic phenomenon related to largely reversible cytotoxicity, inflammation and increased cell proliferation.207 In view of the low levels of exposure to butylated hydroxyanisole that occurs with the usual use of this agent, carcinogenic hazard for the human stomach is therefore very small.\n",

Hypolipidemic agents that inhibit oxidosqualene have also been reported to produce squamous hyperplasia in the forestomach of mice and hamsters.220., 221. The hyperplasia produced by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is time and dose dependent and may be associated with edema and inflammation of the submucosa.

The mechanism of action remains unclear, although this effect seems correlated to their pharmacodynamic activity. Detailed morphological study of the forestomach in rats treated with lovastatin suggested that it is related to the effects on the assembly of cholesterol and other lipids into the lamella bodies and intracellular lipid sheets.224 Their tumorigenic potential in rodent bioassays does not seem to relate to the degree of hyperplasia in short-term studies.204 Moreover, the development of hyperplasia depends on local high concentrations of drug because when administered by non-oral routes, hyperplasia does not occur.210 As most of these drugs are non-mutagenic, these findings are presumably also epigenetic in origin and possess relatively little risk for humans when given in the usual therapeutic doses.",

When fed to rats at doses of 1.0 and 10 mg/kg/day, aristolochic acid produced severe papillomatosis of the entire forestomach within a period of three months. This was characterized histologically by the presence of branched squamous papillomas up to 6 mm high with focal dysplastic features. Invasive squamous carcinomas with metastases were found subsequently three or six months later without further treatment.225 Even at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day papillomas and squamous carcinomas developed nine months after a three-month period of treatment. These findings preclude the safe use of aristolochic acid for therapeutic purposes. Indeed the use of aristolochic acid has been associated with the development of a specific nephropathy and with urothelial cancer in humans.226\n",

Gastrin secreted from the G cells of the antrum is the main stimulant of acid secretion. Somatostatin is secreted from antral D cells when the luminal pH falls to below 3.5 to act by a paracrine mechanism to suppress G cell function thus forming a negative feedback loop.246 The two main endocrine cell types from the body mucosa integrate neurohumoral stimuli rather than respond to luminal chemicals. Although gastrin is capable of stimulating parietal cells directly, it has an even greater effect through stimulation of enterchromaffin cells to release histamine, a potent paracrine stimulator of parietal cells.247 Gastrin stimulates release of histamine from enterochromaffin cells of the body mucosa, which increases acid secretion through activation of parietal cell histamine H2 receptors. Both parietal and enterochromaffin cells are inhibited by somatostatin released from the D cells of the body mucosa in response to a variety of neurohumoral stimuli such as norepinephrine (noradrenalin), vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and cholecystokinin. Gastrin acts at the gastrin/cholecystokinin B receptor that is expressed by gastric epithelial cells as well as by neurons in the central nervous system.248., 249. The gastrin receptor is a cholecystokinin B type receptor located in the stomach. The other cholecystokinin receptor, cholecystokinin A, has high affinity for cholecystokinin. Stimulation of this receptor in the stomach mediates secretion of pepsin from gastric chief cells and release of somatostatin from D cells resulting in inhibition of acid secretion.",

This is a layer of mucus gel along with bicarbonate and hydrophobic phospholipids which maintains a near neutral pH as well as a physical barrier.255 Much of our knowledge about mucins produced by the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract has been obtained using histochemical techniques and these approaches can be helpful in the understanding of spontaneous and drug-induced gastrointestinal disease.256., 257., 258. The physiochemical properties of gastrointestinal mucins are dependent on their glycoprotein constituents. These glycoproteins are high molecular weight compounds with large numbers of sugar chains attached to a polypeptide backbone by O-glycosidic linkages between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine.259 The principal monosaccharides present are fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Due to this extensive glycosylation, mucins have a filamentous conformation, which is often negatively charged. This is believed to be important in forming a protective barrier to the cell. However, this property is a two-edged sword because when opposing cells have specific receptors for mucins, adhesion may become the predominant factor.260\n",

Low dose aspirin used in elderly patients to prevent cerebral and myocardial ischemia is also associated with gastrointestinal damage.271., 272. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and peptic (gastric and upper small intestine) ulceration is one of their well-known adverse effects.273\nA systematic analysis of the published data suggested that one-third of patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for long periods develop upper gastrointestinal tract injury.274 Serious injury is less common, although gastrointestinal bleeding following non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy is a significant cause of serious and sometimes fatal adverse drug reactions.275., 276., 277., 278., 279., 280. In one prospective study, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by these compounds accounted for 10% of those hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions.278 Predisposing factors in human patients with peptic ulceration include Helicobacter pylori infection of the antrum, cigarette smoking and alcohol use.271., 281. Peptic-ulcer disease has been shown to be more common in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than in those without the infection, suggesting a possible interaction between drug use and this infection in the development of peptic ulcer.274\nHelicobacter pylori is a micro-aerophilic, Gram-negative organism that possesses potent urease activity crucial for its survival at acidic pH. Genome sequence analysis has shown that Helicobacter pylori has well-developed sequences for motility, scavenging iron and DNA restriction and modification systems used by bacteria to degrade foreign DNA. The link between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulceration has been related to increases in gastrin release, perhaps through bacterial products or cytokines released from activated lymphocytes.282\n",

The theory that has gained widespread acceptance is that the ulcerogenic potential of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is related to their pharmacological activity. John Vane proposed that the ulcerogenic potential of these agents is largely a result of their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase, thereby reducing the protective effects of prostaglandins.283 By inhibiting cyclooxygenase these agents not only reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines but also prostaglandin synthesis. Indeed, there is a good correlation between time and dose dependency of induced suppression of gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis and potential for peptic ulceration.284 Why this should lead to ulceration is less clear but it probably is a result of effects on several components of mucosal defense. Local irritancy of some formulations may be important and there may be alterations to the microcirculation, impairment of repair and changes in mucin or bicarbonate production.273., 284.\n",

This was based on the postulate that constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) protects gastric mucosa whereas the inducible isoform COX-2 is responsible for inflammation and pain. While the benefit of selective COX-2 inhibitors for protection of the gastrointestinal tract is generally accepted, the situation turns out to be far more complex than originally envisaged. Many different mediators have been shown to contribute to the resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to injury.273., 285. Indeed, in some circumstances COX-2 produces a highly potent gastro-protective substance 15-R-lipoxin A4. Moreover, one of the most dramatic pharmaceutical events over recent years has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of certain of these selective COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. Vioxx\u2122 (rofecoxib) and Bextra\u2122 (valdecoxib), because of concerns over their cardiovascular safety and skin effects which have been shown in major clinical trials.286., 287.\n",

Erosions and ulcers develop in laboratory animals following stress, reflux of intestinal contents and bile, changes in acid secretion and hypoxia, all of which may develop under the conditions occurring in high dose toxicity studies. The requirement to give the test compound in high doses may also dictate the need to administer exceedingly high concentrations of test agent which may simply damage the mucosa as a result of local irritancy in a manner not relevant to therapeutic doses used in clinical practice. For example, it has been demonstrated that oral administration of hyperosmolar solutions of quite innocuous substances such as glucose or sodium chloride can cause gastric inflammation, hemorrhage, erosions and ulcers of the rat gastric mucosa.296., 297. Hyperosmolar solutions of sodium chloride have also been shown to induce increased expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes of CYP1A and CYP3A subtypes in the surface and foveolar cells of the gastric mucosa of rats, which could also modify the expression of xenobiotic activity.297 The well-known association of gastric erosions and hemorrhage with uremia may also be manifest following administration of high doses of drugs such as diuretics which severely derange fluid and electrolyte balance.19 Synergism between the ulcerogenic action of drugs and stress is also a well-described phenomenon.298., 299.

The powerful non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and phenybutazone produced gastric mucosal erosion and ulcers as well as small intestinal damage. However, novel targeted therapies for treatment of cancer may not fall into these simple categories. For example, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which produced single cell necrosis in the intestine in treated rats also produced cell damage (apoptosis) in the gastric glands of the fundus and pyloric regions most markedly in the basal zones and isthmus regions.302\n",

This damage was associated with transient fecal blood loss. By contrast, indomethacin and ibuprofen produced both gastric damage and circumscribed, penetrating ulcers along the mesenteric border of the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, ulcers were still present after two weeks and were associated with prolonged or biphasic blood loss. Pharmacokinetic factors may also be important.

It also may explain the tendency for ulcers to occur in the antrum following chronic administration of aspirin-like drugs as the proliferative response and presumably the adaptive potential appears less in this part of the gastric mucosa.

However, the simple concept that COX-1 inhibition causes gastrointestinal damage and selective COX-2 inhibition is not ulcerogenic has been clouded by a number of experimental observations.313 For example, inhibition of COX-2 delays gastric ulcer healing through interference with cell proliferation, angiogenesis and maturation of granulation tissue.314 Moreover, high dose toxicity studies revealed that COX-2 inhibitors can cause gastrointestinal ulceration. For example, rats, dogs and mice all developed gastric or pyloric ulceration when treated with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, although the distal small intestine seemed to be more markedly affected.315 It has been shown by immunocytochemistry that the distribution of COX-2 expression in interstitial cells (monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) of the lamina propria predominates in the distal ileum which has led to the suggestion that this might be a factor in the greater sensitivity of the ileum than the stomach to the ulcerogenic effects of COX-2 inhibition.316\n",

These variants fall into two main groups, a so-called incomplete type and a complete form.266., 332., 333., 334. Others have proposed that it is best regarded in terms of gastric, intestinal and mixed phenotypes.335 Complete intestinal metaplasia is characterized by the presence of goblet cells, Paneth cells and absorptive cells with brush borders and variably developed intestinal villi. Incomplete forms are more heterogeneous, characterized by goblet and mucous columnar cells but no absorptive cells and variable patterns of mucin. The routine alcian blue stain performed at pH 2.5 and periodic acid-Schiff stain distinguishes between the intestinal acid mucins (blue) and the neutral mucins of gastric type. However, variable sialomucin and sulfomucin staining patterns are also seen in intestinal metaplasia in humans if staining with the high iron-diamine/alcian blue stain is performed. The incomplete form of intestinal metaplasia, showing marked sulfomucin secretion, has been found more commonly in association with gastric cancer in people.266., 332., 334. However, it is probable that intestinal metaplasia itself represents an adaptive response to long-standing chronic inflammation and reduced acid secretion. It has also been suggested that it represents an adaptive defensive response to long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection because intestinal mucosa is more resistant to these organisms.336., 337. Immunocytochemical study has shown the presence of intestinal endocrine cells in the various forms of intestinal metaplasia that appears to follow the phenotype of the particular mucous cell differentiation.335\n",

This is characterized histologically by reduced height of the mucosa and reduced numbers and staining intensity of argyrophil cells.358 It has been argued that this unilateral atrophy is due to the removal of the trophic action of the vagus. The lack of lasting atrophy after bilateral but not unilateral vagotomy has been explained by the subsequent rise in gastrin that occurs after bilateral vagotomy as a result of lack of acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release.358\n",

Hypergastrinemia in turn stimulates enterochromaffin cells of the fundus, which in time results in enterochromaffin hyperplasia.238 This argument is supported by the fact that similar morphological findings are reported in chronic atrophic gastritis and other achlorhydric sites in humans and that antrectomy in the rat prevents the appearance of enterochromaffin hyperplasia following treatment with omeprazole.420., 421., 422.\n",

Why mice developed neither argyrophil hyperplasia nor gastric carcinoids with a similar treatment regimen is not clear, as the mechanism of action of omeprazole is similar in rat, dog and mouse. However, as the duration of action of omeprazole was shorter in the mouse, it was postulated that sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion over 24 hours is necessary to activate increased gastrin secretion from antral cells.411 It has also been suggested that the mouse possesses fewer gastric enterochromaffin cells than the rat and shows a much lower serum gastrin response to omeprazole treatment.412 Nevertheless, gastric neuroendocrine tumors have occasionally been reported to develop spontaneously in old laboratory mice where they can be an issue in carcinogenicity studies because of their association with raised gastrin levels.423\n",

In a 21-month oral carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice at the same dose level (1,000 mg/kg), a diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and multifocal glandular hyperplasia and neoplasia was also observed.242., 393.

However, concerns about nitrosation have arisen in subsequent clinical practice. An example of this was the proposal that a few gastric cancers found in patients while being treated with the histamine H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine were the result of treatment.435., 436., 437. It now seems likely that all those observed cancers associated with cimetidine were incidental.438 However, at that time concerns were increased by the theoretical possibility that cimetidine has the potential to be nitrosated in vivo.\n435 A further factor was the concept that the treatment-induced gastric secretory inhibition with subsequent bacterial colonization of the stomach rendered the conditions conducive to the generation of N-nitroso compounds from normal dietary constituents.436., 438. All these concerns appear to be unfounded. Long-term surveillance studies with cimetidine have shown no causal link between its clinical usage and gastric malignancy.439., 440. In addition, carcinogenicity bioassays performed with cimetidine, cimetidine plus nitrite and nitrosocimetidine have not shown any tumorigenic effect in the gastric mucosa.441 A seven-year study in dogs in which multiple gastric biopsies were taken at intervals of approximately six months has also shown no indication of gastric hyperplasia, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia or neoplastic change.442 Although complacency is certainly not warranted with respect to the nitrosation of therapeutic agents in vivo, the risks of development of gastric malignancy from such drugs when administered on a short-term basis are probably very small.443 Even for gastric antisecretory agents administered for longer periods of time, the balanced view would also permit development of novel agents provided they are not obviously mutagenic or carcinogenic in the usual preclinical studies and are not particularly liable to undergo rapid nitrosation.",

Electron microscopy of the absorptive cells shows that the surface of absorptive cells is covered by tightly packed and well-developed microvilli approximately 1 \u03bcm long and 0.1 \u03bcm wide.

Goblet cells are characterized by the presence of abundant mucous droplets formed by the Golgi complex which accumulate in the apical part of the cell cytoplasm. Histochemical study shows that neutral mucins are present in the goblet cells found in crypts and on the villi in the entire small bowel mucosa of most species including humans but there is an interspecies variation in the population of sialo- and sulfomucins.256 In the mouse, sulfomucins predominate but among rats considerable individual variation in the proportion of sialo- and sulfomucins is reported. In the hamster, sulfomucins are more prominent in the proximal and sialomucins in the distal small bowel. In the dog, both sulfomucins and sialomucins are found with predominance of one or other in individual animals.

Particular care is needed in fixation and staining for optimal demonstration of Paneth cells for they rapidly degranulate after death and granules are destroyed by acetic acid fixation. Formalin and mercuric fixatives appear appropriate methods and they permit staining with methylene blue, Lendrum\u2019s phloxine-tartrazine and Masson\u2019s trichrome.467 The apical parts of Paneth cells show glucose-6-phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase and monoamine oxidase activity and they have been shown to contain lysozyme and immunoglobulins, particularly IgA.465., 468., 469., 470. The Paneth cell granules also contain antimicrobial peptides such as secretory phospholipid A2, \u03b1 defensins also called cryptins. These are believed to possess not only antimicrobiol activity but are also important in the regulation of cell volume, chemotaxis, mitogenesis and inhibition of natural killer cell activity.471., 472., 473., 474. Studies of transgenic and knockout mice have supported a pivotal role of Paneth cell defensins in protection from oral bacterial pathogens.

These cells have been identified in many species including rats, mice, hamsters, dogs, monkeys and humans.490., 491. These cells differ functionally from other enterocytes by their ability to transport large molecules such as ferritin and horseradish peroxidase and particulate matter from the lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue.492., 493. They have also been shown to be the site of penetration of reoviruses into the epithelium and they can transport Vibrio cholerae and other organisms.491., 494. M cells therefore form points in the intestinal wall which transport intact antigen and macromolecules to the follicles where they can be processed and be transported to lymph nodes with consequent IgA immune responses. This contrasts with the uptake of soluble antigens, which can be taken up by ordinary epithelial cells and transported in the circulation of the villi to be ultimately trapped in the spleen, possibly to evoke an IgM/IgG response.493 Understanding of these cellular and molecular characteristics is critical for the design of mucosal vaccines for pathogens that exploit this pathway.495\n",

These differences result in poor preservation of mast cells of the gut if the usual metachromatic staining techniques are employed for the demonstration of mast cells in tissue sections.497 Histochemical study suggests that mucosal mast cells differ from connective tissue mast cells by a lower degree of sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and different spatial relationships of protein and glycosaminoglycans in their granules. These cross-link following formalin fixation to prohibit cationic dye binding and prevent histological staining.

Erosions, ulcers and strictures have been associated with a number of therapeutic agents in people.170 Antimitotic or radiomimetic agents as well as ionizing radiation are liable to adversely affect the rapidly dividing cells of the small intestine with resulting breakdown of the mucosal barrier. Newer targeted anticancer drugs have also been associated with intestinal damage.3 The ulcerogenic activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also expressed in the small bowel mucosa, most commonly in the distal ileum. Moreover, different agents also act in synergy to enhance damage to the small bowel mucosa. Important examples are drugs that depress the immune system or antimicrobial agents that permit the development of pathological infections by microorganisms of the opportunistic type in the small intestine. Vasoconstriction may also result in intestinal ulceration. For example, life-threatening gastrointestinal ulceration is reported as a result of cocaine abuse. Although gastrointestinal complications are less common than cardiac damage, cocaine abuse may induce mesenteric ischemia as a result of vasoconstriction leading to gastric or intestinal ulceration and perforation of the entire wall.501., 502. It appears that the abuse of the free base form of cocaine (crack) is more liable to produce more upper gastrointestinal intestinal damage than oral cocaine abuse which tends to induce more distal intestinal perforation. Although the exact mechanism leading to intestinal ischemia is not certain, cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenalin) which is believed to be the cause of mesenteric vasoconstriction and ischemia.",

This organism was first recognized in the gastric glands of mice by Tyzzer in 1907 and has since been confirmed as a cause of diarrhea in animals and as a human pathogen. It causes mild diarrhea in normal subjects especially children and young adults but it can produce severe intestinal disease in immunocompromised individuals.522 Histological examination of the small intestine of laboratory animals infested by cryptosporidium reveals the presence of organisms attached to the mucosal surface, often associated, as in humans, with other parasites or infections. They are rounded, weakly basophilic structures 1\u20134 \u03bcm diameter in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections but are strongly basophilic following Romanowsky staining. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the detailed internal structure of cryptosporidium attached to the microvillous surface of the epithelial cells. The various stages in the life cycle have been visualized by light and electron microscopy. Infection starts with ingestion of an oocyst containing four sporozoites, which are probably released by the action of digestive enzymes. These attach themselves to the intestinal mucosa and undertake their life cycle attached to the epithelial cells. These organisms have been demonstrated in most laboratory species including mice, hamsters, rabbits, dogs and monkeys.504., 523., 524., 525., 526.\n",

Ulcers were still present two weeks later. In dogs, indomethacin given orally in doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day for one to 23 days was also shown to produce deep, punched-out ulcers in the small intestine, many of which were situated over Peyer\u2019s patches.536 Some ulcers involved the whole circumference of the small intestine wall. Histologically, the ulcers were associated with an intense inflammatory response principally of mononuclear cells, which infiltrated the bowel wall down to the serosa, particularly adjacent to Peyer\u2019s patches. It was suggested that this distribution of ulcers was a result of an exaggerated immune response to normal intestinal antigens following depression of prostaglandin synthetase by indomethacin.\n",

Antimitotic anticancer drugs, high doses of antiviral drugs that depress cell proliferation and immunosuppressive agents may also produce intestinal mucosal apoptosis, necrosis, hemorrhage, inflammation and opportunistic gastrointestinal overgrowth when administered to dogs or rodents in high doses (Figure 8.7\n).540., 541., 542., 543., 544., 545. Drugs include the older anticancer drugs of diverse structural and pharmacological types as well as new antimitotic agents and so-called \u2018targeted\u2019 anticancer therapies such as those acting on vascular endothelial growth factor or microtubules.3 Acute disruption of the upper small intestinal mucosa is considered to be an important factor in the development of nausea and vomiting during anticancer therapy. Chemotherapy is believed to induce free radicals formation leading to localized exocytotic release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from the enterochromaffin cells which interacts with 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors on vagal afferent terminals in the wall of the bowel. These link to the dorsal brain stem and the area postrema to produce nausea and vomiting.546\n",

Although these different agents influence gastric acid secretion in different ways, structure\u2013activity relationships suggest that they produce duodenal dysmotility, decrease bicarbonate production and reduce its delivery from the distal to proximal duodenum. These factors decrease the neutralization of gastric acid in the first part of the duodenum which may contribute to the development of ulceration.555 Furthermore, these effects can be attenuated or prevented by dopamine agonists or their precursors whereas dopamine antagonists can potentiate their effects suggesting dopamine-mediated actions of these agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration.556., 557.\n",

Electron microscopic examination revealed uniform electron-lucent droplets within profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Lipid droplets increased with time and accumulated to form large droplets in the lamina propria. Larger droplets were phagocytosed by macrophages in the lamina propria but there was no evidence of epithelial damage or necrosis. Changes were most pronounced in the duodenum but were also noted to a lesser extent in jejunum and ileum but not in colon or stomach. Sequential studies using electron microscopy showed that lipid rapidly accumulated within several hours in the profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the epithelial cells and formed droplets or chylomicra in the intercellular space. The absence of any other subcellular changes or evidence of derangement of protein synthesis suggested that Sa H51-055 altered the pathways of lipid resynthesis or transport. This was consistent with the distribution of the lipid in the upper third of the jejunal villous epithelium, a zone reported to be most active in lipid absorption, resynthesis and transport.559 It was suggested that fatty change might have taken place because of alterations in the sugar moiety of chylomicra brought about by interference with glucose transport.",

This form of lipid storage disorder is produced by diverse amphiphilic cationic drugs in laboratory animals and occasionally in patients usually as a result of drug interaction with polar lipids rendering them difficult to digest (see Respiratory Tract, Chapter 6). Species differences in susceptibility and tissue distribution of phospholipid are probably of diverse origin. They are related not only to physiochemical characteristics of the inducing drugs which influence their ability to permeate selective biomembranes and react with different lipids but also to local tissue concentrations of drugs and the ability of particular organs to metabolize parent drug to less amphiphilic products. In general terms, this disorder is characterized by membrane-bound, acid phosphatase-positive cytoplasmic inclusions, which on ultrastructural study are seen as lamellar crystalloid structures in lysosomes.

Although its adverse effects in patients have been linked to accumulation of drug in lysosomes, particularly in liver, skin and eye, toxicity does not appear to be a direct result of the accumulation of phospholipids. After high doses of amiodarone were administered orally to rats and beagle dogs, multilamellar lysosomal inclusion bodies accumulated first in the jejunal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes before becoming widely distributed in other organs, particularly in the lungs.565 In both rats and dogs the small intestinal lesions were characterized by the presence of foamy macrophages with pale finely vacuolated cytoplasm and condensed eccentric nuclei within the lamina propria of the jejunal villi. Mesenteric lymph nodes were also involved early after the onset of treatment. In the dog, jejunal villi were somewhat flattened and widened or showed a variable degree of villous atrophy, most marked in the proximal and middle jejunum.566 Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of lamellar lysosomal bodies distending macrophages.",

Partial resection in both rats and humans is accompanied by increased villous height and crypt length.578., 579. This is primarily the result of hyperplasia for it has been shown that the numbers of cells per unit length of villus remains unchanged but there is an overall increase in the cell population of villus and crypt. DNA/RNA ratios remain largely unaltered.457 No gross changes in villous shape have been reported after resection and the total number of crypts remains constant. Although increased intestinal uptake of substances from the bowel lumen occurs in hypertrophied segments per unit length of bowel, disaccharide and dipeptidase activities are normal or even decreased after resection suggesting a comparative immaturity of cells in the residual mucosa. Functional adaptation therefore is largely achieved by a larger number of cells but their individual absorptive capacity is not increased.457 Increased numbers of specific goblet cell populations are also seen in hyperfunctional states. Following jejuno-ileal bypass operations in rats, increased numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells develop in the villi and crypts of the hyperfunctional segments of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.580 Mucin histochemistry has shown that the goblet cells in the hyperfunctional segments contain increased sialomucins in the villi and crypts of the jejunum and ileum but not in the duodenum and increased sulfomucins in the distal ileal segment. As sialic acid conveys more viscoelastic properties to mucin, it has been suggested that the goblet cells change following intestinal bypass and fulfill a protective function against the increased flow of gastrointestinal contents.580\n",

These different effects may be the result of differences in solubility, gel formation, water holding capacity, effect on transit time and ion exchange activity or bile acid adsorption of the different fibers.

The proliferative lesions were found in a few control CD-1 mice in the same study. In addition, it was also argued that the lesions were neither neoplastic nor preneoplastic in nature.

Indeed chronic administration of hydrogen peroxide, widely used as an antiseptic and in dental products, to C57BL/6J mice in drinking water was reported by Ito and colleagues not only to potentiate the development of a similar type of duodenal hyperplasia but also to produce a small number of adenocarcinomas after a period of two years.591., 594. These were non-metastatic atypical (dyplastic) flat lesions associated with erosions and inflammation. It has been argued that as hydrogen peroxide is unlikely to reach the duodenum intact, these results were related to an interaction with greatly decreased water consumption and the resultant abrasion of the luminal lining by dry pelleted rodent feed.595 However, this may simply be another example of neoplastic development following prolonged periods of chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal mucosa at doses irrelevant for the usual use of hydrogen peroxide in humans (see neoplasia, below).",

An exception to this is the agent amylopectin sulfate, which has a far higher molecular weight. However, amylopectin is composed of polysaccharide chains which can be degraded by amylase, and therefore smaller molecular weight fragments may be formed in vivo.\n642 It has been suggested that colonic disease produced by these agents may be linked to induced changes in intestinal microflora or a result of increased intestinal permeability to antigenic or inflammatory substances normally resident in the large intestine.645., 650.\n",

Melanosis coli is due to the excessive accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigment in the macrophages of the colonic lamina propria.654., 655., 656. This pigment probably originates from organelles of epithelial cells or macrophages, which are damaged by treatment. On the basis of the study of melanosis coli induced in guinea pigs by anthraquinones it has been suggested that the primary process is a treatment-induced increase in apoptotic bodies in the surface colonic epithelium that are phagocytosed by intraepithelial macrophages and transported to the lamina propria.657 While pigment deposits are inducible in guinea pigs, they do not seem to occur in rats, mice or dogs.658., 659., 660. Oral rat toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of the widely used laxative senna have shown colonic epithelial hyperplasia but no evidence of carcinogenicity which is consistent with the benign nature of melanosis coli and its lack of risk for cancer in human patients.659., 660., 661.\n",

Goblet cells contain predominantly sialomucin instead of the normal sulfomucin.257., 500., 673. As lesions become more atypical, these dilated, branched glands become more complex and lined by epithelium that shows increasing pseudostratification and vesicular cell nuclei.674 In rats treated with the carcinogens azoxymethane or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, crypts show diminution of mucus secretion, increased cytoplasmic basophilia, prominent, rounded or enlarged nuclei which show variable degrees of pseudostratification and which eventually develop into frankly invasive glands.673 Similar alterations occur in rats treated with azoxymethane.

It is likely that this provides a microenvironment which aids proliferation and survival of malignant cells, promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, subverts immune responses and alters responses to hormones and other mediators.692 Other suggested factors include reduced apoptosis, alterations to crypt cell metabolism and changes in bile acid enterohepatic circulation. It has also been suggested that bacteria flora specific to rodents might also be involved in tumor development.694\n",

As these polyps progress they show increased nuclear pseudostratification and a typical branching of their glands.
