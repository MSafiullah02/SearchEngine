BACKGROUND: RVLS obtained from two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) has been recently demonstrated to be a more accurate and sensitive tool to estimate RV function. The prognostic value of RVLS in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: 120 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography examination were enrolled in our study. Conventional right ventricular (RV) function parameters, including RV fractional area change (RVFAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid tissue Doppler annular velocities (S'), were obtained. RVLS was determined by 2D-STE. RV function was categorized by tertiles of RVLS. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the highest RVLS tertile, those in the lowest tertile were more likely to have a higher heart rate, D-dimer and C-reactive protein, high-flow oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation therapy, higher incidence of acute heart injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and deep vein thrombosis, and higher mortality. After a median follow-up of 51 days, 18 patients died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors displayed enlarged right-heart chamber, diminished RV function, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Male, ARDS, RVLS, RVFAC and TAPSE were significant univariate predictors of higher risk of mortality (P < 0.05 for all). The Cox model using RVLS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.33, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.15\uff5e1.53; P < 0.001; Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] =129; C-index = 0.89) was found to predict higher mortality more accurately than that with RVFAC (AIC =142; C-index = 0.84) and TAPSE (AIC = 144; C-index = 0.83). The best cutoff value of RVLS for prediction of outcome was \u221223% (area under the curve, 0.87; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: RVLS is a powerful predictor of higher mortality in patients with COVID-19. Our study supports the application of RVLS to identify higher risk COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reaches more than 170 countries, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Although currently available studies confirmed the presence of myocardial injury and its association with mortality in patients with COVID-19, 1-2 they lack evidence from echocardiography to determine the features of cardiac injury. As the prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported to be 29% -67% of critically ill patients with COVID-19, 3,4 right ventricular (RV) function is supposed to be more susceptible to impairment due to increased RV afterload. In clinical practice, RV structure and function are mainly evaluated by echocardiography. The conventional echocardiographic parameter have limited diagnostic value, as they may fail to detect early abnormalities of RV systolic function. 5 Recently, two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) has been introduced, which evaluates myocardial function accurately and reproducibly. 6, 7 Because of its capability to detect subclinical impairment of cardiac function, 2D-STE has been extensively applied to investigate RV function in different clinical settings. [8] [9] [10] Moreover, the RV longitudinal strain (RVLS) derived from 2D-STE has been demonstrated to be of prognostic value. 11 To the best of our knowledge, there are no data regarding the use of RVLS in patients with COVID-19. In addition, confirming the role of RVLS in these patients may be of additional significance, as most cases exhibit the preserved conventional echocardiographic parameters, among whom detection and risk stratification may be challenging. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RVLS in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Although our study was a cohort of homogenous and consecutive patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, it is limited by being a single-center study with a relatively limited sample size. Our hospital is one of hardest-hit hospitals by the COVID-19 in Wuhan, the patients we included may not represent the population in other areas. Moreover, we enrolled patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and the asymptomatic patients who had not been admitted to hospital were not included. Considering the wide clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our findings may not be applicable to the entire COVID-19 population. Therefore, future studies with multi-center and a larger sample size studies are needed to determine the prognosis value of RVLS in COVID-19 patients. Beside, we excluded 24 patients owing to poor image quality precluding strain analysis, which limits the generalizability of our results. And the results pertain only to the software used in our study and may not apply to other software algorithms because the 2D-STE parameters are hampered by the intervendor variability. we used RV free-wall LS instead of global RV strain because a simultaneous echocardiographic-catheterization study demonstrated that free-wall LS might better reflect RV function than global RV strain. 27 Moreover, the relationship between LV and RV function could not be explored in the present study, as RV function could be affected by subclinical LV dysfunction. Furthermore, obesity patients were uncommon in our study, as obesity is preliminarily considered as a high risk factor.",

TAPSE and S' only represent the longitudinal movement of the basal segment of RV free wall and may fail to accurately reflect the entire RV performance. FAC is dependent on imaging plane, causing considerable interobserver and intraobserver variability in patients with suboptimal endocardial definition. In particular, the insufficient image quality in some patients with COVID-19 limits the accuracy of RVFAC measurement. Recently, 2D STE has been recommended as a superior method for assessment of RV performance, which has the advantage of being angle independent. Moreover, it can detect RV dysfunction more accurately and sensitively than TAPSE or FAC. Prior studies have revealed the prognostic utility of RVLS in various clinical settings.5,[25][26] Importantly, we demonstrated the superiority of RVLS over conventional RV function parameters in identifying association with outcomes. These findings were in keeping with the study of Carluccio et al,5 which demonstrated that RVLS provided incremental prognostic information and enhanced risk stratification in heart failure patients with preserved TAPSE.The superiority of RVLS may be related to several reasons. First, RVLS includes the whole RV free wall (basal, mid and apical segments), contrary to TAPSE and S', which assess only basal longitudinal motion. Furthermore, by tracking the myocardium throughout the cardiac cycle, RVLS can easily identify the maximal and minimal values of deformation, whereas FAC acquisition depends on end-diastole and end-systole frames. Finally, RVLS has been considered as a strong prognostic indicator for various cardiovascular diseases.",
