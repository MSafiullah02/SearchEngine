Infectious disease transmission was explained by influences including witchcraft, religious forces, earthquakes, comets, and meteors (Chakrabarti, 2010, Karamanou et al., 2012). In the mid-1800s, while it was already accepted that some infectious diseases such as smallpox and syphilis were contagious, ample debate surrounded the origin of certain illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever, and the miasma theory became the predominant model to explain cholera transmission (Tulodziecki, 2011). The miasma theory, still widespread in the early 19th century, proposed that decaying and decomposing organic matter generates new compounds that are released into the air and are poisonous to people (Halliday, 2001, Julia and Valleron, 2011, Tulodziecki, 2011).",

            "text": "A critical step toward understanding the fecal-oral transmission route came during the 1853\u20131854 London cholera outbreak, when John Snow, one of the founders of epidemiology, correlated cholera mortality with the water source. Snow applied for and received mortality reports from the General Register Office, and his conclusions relied on two different data sets (Koch and Denike, 2009). In addition to visiting houses affected by cholera to determine the water source that deceased individuals used, Snow mapped the location of their homes and that of the public water pumps (Koch and Denike, 2009, Newsom, 2006). Based on a map of 578 cholera cases that occurred in August and September 1854, Snow concluded that more deaths occurred near the pump on Broad Street, which in the 1930s became Broadwick Street (Koch, 2009, Newsom, 2006, Ramsay, 2006). This confirmed his theory about cholera transmission through contaminated water, contrary to the belief, popular at the time, that the illness was airborne (Shiode et al., 2015). While the city removed the pump handle on September 8, 1854, on Snow\u2019s recommendation, the epidemic was already subsiding at the time (Newsom, 2006, Paneth, 2004). The medical community was not convinced by Snow\u2019s evidence, and he continued to argue that the ingestion of contaminated water was the cause of cholera, a theory that was accepted only in 1866 (Ramsay, 2006).\n",

More than 250 different foodborne diseases have been described, and they may be caused by biological agents (such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other parasites, and prions), chemicals, or preformed toxins (Epp and Parker, 2009, Kalyoussef and Feja, 2014). Some foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella typhi, do not have an animal reservoir and cause strictly human disease, while others, such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella enteritidis, may be transmitted to humans from animal reservoirs (see Chapters 5 and 7). Foodborne and waterborne illnesses are underestimated and underreported, and this is particularly true for infections caused by viruses, whose importance has been increasingly recognized (see Chapter 14). To a great extent, this has to do with the fact that many of the foodborne pathogens may also be transmitted via other pathways (Hall et al., 2008). Moreover, medical help is usually not sought for short-lived foodborne illnesses and, as a consequence, these are often not reported (see Chapter 2).",

The lack of signs and symptoms in all the individuals who ingested contaminated food, the fact that people may not remember everything they ate during the period immediately preceding their illness, and the presence of multiple ingredients from several sources in many food products are additional considerations that make the identification of contaminated and contaminating ingredients more challenging (see Chapter 2).",

Also, in May 2011, an outbreak caused by Shiga toxin\u2013producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 was identified in Germany, and eventually it affected more than 4000 individuals in 16 countries (MMWR, 2013). An unusually high number of infected patients developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome, making this outbreak the most dramatic since enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) was identified as a cause of human illness (Beutin and Martin, 2012). While initial investigations implicated mixed raw sprouts from a farm in Germany, subsequent investigations identified the source of the outbreak in a lot of fenugreek seeds that had been imported from Egypt (MMWR, 2013) (see Chapter 7).",

For example, transportation and social stress increase the fecal excretion of S. typhimurium in pigs (Callaway et al., 2006, Marg et al., 2001).

This model promotes the view that diarrheal disease could be transmitted through food, flies, fields, fingers, and fluids and played a key role in developing a framework for the multiple pathways of environmental transmission of infectious diseases (Curtis et al., 2000, Eisenberg et al., 2012, Kawata, 1978, Wagner and Lanoix, 1958). Most pathogens that are excreted into the environment usually die. However, some of them reach fingers, fluids, new hosts such as flies, and floor or surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating. From any of these sites, pathogens may reach food and infect a new human host. All these transmission routes can be blocked by changes in domestic hygiene practices (Curtis et al., 2000). This model envisions two types of barriers to reduce disease transmission. Preventing transmission at the level of the primary barriers prevents the entry of the pathogens into the environment, and these initiatives are the most effective interventions to prevent disease transmission. Preventing transmission at the level of the secondary barriers involves initiatives that prevent pathogens that have already entered the environment from multiplying and reaching new hosts (Curtis et al., 2000).",

Survival of pathogens in the irrigation water depends on the level of contamination and is generally better for helminths and viruses, which may remain viable outside a human host for months to years, than for bacteria and protozoans (Steele and Odumeru, 2004). A study that examined the transfer of Listeria innocua from the soil to the edible parts of lettuce revealed that the bacteria survived in the soil for at least 9 weeks during the spring. Survival rates were comparable when the bacteria were introduced via either the compost or surface irrigation. Bacteria were transferred to the edible part of the plant, but it was not clear whether this transfer occurred by direct contact, internalization or through vectors (Oliveira et al., 2011) (see Chapter 12). In a large outbreak of verotoxin-producing E. coli that occurred in 2005 in Sweden, in which 135 individuals became ill including 11 individuals who developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome, lettuce emerged as the most likely cause of illness. Water samples used for irrigation tested positive for the stx2 gene, and bacteria from the affected individuals had an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern with the ones isolated from cattle upstream from the irrigation point (Soderstrom et al., 2008). In another outbreak, a Salmonella Newport strain was implicated in a 2002 outbreak that affected 510 individuals from 26 states in the United States, and the same strain was implicated in a 2005 outbreak that affected people in 16 states. A case\u2013control study conducted during the second outbreak identified eating tomatoes as being associated with illness. The tomatoes were traced back to the eastern shore of Virginia, where the same strain was isolated from pond water that had been used for irrigation (Greene et al., 2008) (see Chapter 5).",

It is relevant that E. coli from cattle, sheep, and pig feces can survive on grass for at least 5\u20136 months, providing opportunities to contaminate animals, plants, or water (Avery et al., 2004). A study that used immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy reported that after radish seeds were experimentally contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the bacteria could be detected on the outer surfaces and in the inner tissues of the cotyledons and in stomata (Itoh et al., 1998). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was transmitted from manure-contaminated soil and irrigation water to lettuce plants, and viable bacteria could be recovered from the inner tissues (Solomon et al., 2002). A study that grew radishes in soil inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes reported that some of the samples were positive for the bacterium for 3 months later (Van Renterghem et al., 1991). Another study revealed that when soil was inoculated with murine norovirus and Tulane virus, surrogates for human norovirus, the viruses became internalized via the roots and reached the leaf and fruit portion of strawberry plants (DiCaprio et al., 2015).",

In the United Kingdom, the epidemic peaked in January 1993 and then subsided drastically (Nathanson et al., 1997). The infectious agent was thought to originate in cattle from the meat and bone meal (MBM), the protein-rich supplement regularly fed to cattle at the beginning of their weaning, and the total MBM ban in the wake of the outbreak reduced the spread of BSE (de Vos and Heres, 2009). Contamination of the MBM appears to have been initiated by the incomplete inactivation of the agent of scrapie, a fatal prion-caused neurodegenerative disease that has been recognized in sheep from Britain for over 250 years (Nathanson et al., 1997, Taylor and Woodgate, 2003, Woolhouse et al., 2001). Meat and bone meal has been regularly fed to adult cattle, especially dairy cows, for at least half of the 20th century, especially after 1970, in Europe and the United States (Ramasamy, 2004). Meat and bone meal administration in larger amounts to dairy cattle than to beef cattle explains the significantly higher incidence of BSE in dairy cows in the United Kingdom outbreak (Bradley and Wilesmith, 1993).",

            "text": "When cattle are killed, rendering is used to separate the melted fat (tallow) from the animal tissues. Conventionally, this process has used heat, which also has a sterilizing effect (Nathanson et al., 1997, Taylor and Woodgate, 2003). Over a century ago, it was found that the protein-rich material that remains after extracting the tallow can be used as a dietary supplement for animals (Taylor and Woodgate, 2003). Separating tallow from animal tissues requires organic solvents and a high-energy input, and this process has become inefficient after fuel prices increased in the 1970s. This, along with more stringent health and safety regulations, led to a decline in the use of organic solvent for extraction. This, together with the change from high-temperature batch rendering to lower-temperature continuous processing, allowed the infectious agent to better survive the rendering process (Almond, 1998, Brewer, 2001, Nathanson et al., 1997). After the proportion of MBM that was prepared with fat solvents declined between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s from 70% to 10%, the less-effective inactivation of the prion protein is thought to have resulted in the first batches of MBM being contaminated (Almond, 1998, Nathanson et al., 1997). These factors are thought to have allowed prions, which are resistant to heat but can be inactivated by lipid solvents, to maintain their infectivity (Brewer, 2001). This gradual elimination of the solvent step did not occur in the United States, where rendering has used high-temperature treatment of the fatty tissues, and organic solvents have not been used (Brewer, 2001). The relevance of the solvent extraction step is also illustrated by the example from Scotland, where solvent extraction has not been discontinued and the rate of BSE was low. While 12.6% of the dairy herds from southern England had BSE in 1988\u20131989, this percentage was only 1.8% in Scotland (Nathanson et al., 1997).",

One of the genetic susceptibility factors to prion diseases in humans is a polymorphism at position 129 of the PRNP gene. Either a methionine or a valine can be found at this position. As of 2011, all but one individual who developed vCJD were homozygous at codon 129 for methionine, and a single heterozygous individual was reported (Mead et al., 2009, Colby and Prusiner, 2011). Another transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, kuru, a neurodegenerative disease described in Papua New Guinea, had an incubation period sometimes exceeding 50 years and was transmitted by ritualistic endocannibalism (which refers to the eating of relatives, as opposed to the eating of enemies, known as exocannibalism) (Gajdusek, 1977, Colby and Prusiner, 2011, Liberski, 2013). Kuru was restricted to members of the For\u00e9 linguistic group and neighboring groups but did not affect groups into which the kuru-affected people did not intermarry. In the For\u00e9 language, the word \u201ckuru\u201d means \u201cto tremble with fear or cold\u201d (Liberski, 2013). The incidence of kuru started to decline after the 1950s when endocannibalism had gradually stopped (Collinge et al., 2006). Studies that examined the molecular genetic basis of susceptibility to kuru found that homozygotes for methionine at codon 129 were overrepresented in the younger age group, while valine homozygotes and heterozygotes were overrepresented in the much older age group, and survivors were almost never carried homozygotes for methionine at this position (Liberski, 2013). Heterozygosity at this codon was associated with older patients and with longer incubation times (Mead et al., 2008). It is thought that heterozygotes were protected from disease by the more difficult interactions between the protein heterodimers, while the homologous protein\u2013protein interactions made homozygotes more susceptible to disease (Palmer et al., 1991).",

A study of ant communities at a municipal hospital from Brazil found several bacterial species, including Escherichia and Salmonella, associated with ants (Pesquero et al., 2008). Another study trapped cockroaches in multiple buildings in Spain and found several bacterial species, including Salmonella (hospital), E. coli (food-industry plant and home care), and Enterobacter (hospital, catering establishment, grocery stores, and food-industry plant), associated with the insects (Garcia et al., 2012). The examination of cockroaches collected at hospitals, houses, grocery stores, animal sheds, and restaurants from the South Kanara District in southwestern India revealed that more than 4% harbored several Salmonella strains (Devi and Murray, 1991).\n",

The danger of flies as vectors of foodborne pathogens is compounded by the fact that they have been observed to defecate at 4- to 5-min intervals throughout the day (Rosef and Kapperud, 1983). Adult houseflies were able to transmit bacteria from food to their eggs, and some of the bacteria were also transmitted to first-generation adult flies (Pava-Ripoll et al., 2015).",

The housefly Musca domestica is the fly species most often found to carry Campylobacter species (Bahrndorff et al., 2014, Hald et al., 2008). The seasonality of Campylobacter infections, which increase in incidence in May and June, was hypothesized to reflect the direct or indirect exposure of humans to contaminated material carried by fly species that have been in contact with human, bird, or animal feces or became contaminated by raw food. A study that plotted the time required for M. domestica larval development against ambient temperature from England and Wales for 1989 and 1999 found a strong relationship between the weekly number of human Campylobacter infections and M. domestica larval development times. The periods when human Campylobacter cases exceed a 7-day average of 170 cases per day occurred when the M. domestica larval development time was less than 3 weeks (Nichols, 2005).",

The most typical outbreak scenario is that of an infected food worker contaminating food or food contact surfaces (Todd et al., 2007). A Giardia lamblia (also known as Giardia duodenalis; see Chapter 15) outbreak in November 1990 affected employees at a Connecticut company and resulted in 18 laboratory-confirmed and nine suspected cases of giardiasis. A case\u2013control study implicated raw sliced vegetables that were served in the employee cafeteria and prepared by an infected food handler. While this employee always wore gloves when preparing sandwiches, she had been seen without gloves when preparing vegetables for a salad (Mintz et al., 1993). In September 1998, a Campylobacter outbreak was reported in Salina, Kansas, among people who attended a luncheon at an elementary school and in several community members. Consumption of gravy or pineapple was associated with illness, and both food products were prepared in a kitchen that served six other schools, none of which experienced outbreaks. The outbreak was traced to a cafeteria worker who had diarrhea, and isolates with identical PFGE pattern were obtained from the worker and from eight lunch attendees. Four community members became ill during the same time, but the strains that they were infected with presented different PFGE patterns. This was the first time when PFGE analysis was used during the epidemiological analysis of a Campylobacter outbreak in the United States, and it revealed that the school cases were the result of an outbreak, while the community members were infected in unrelated, sporadic infections (Olsen et al., 2001) (see Chapter 8 for more on Campylobacter epidemiology).",

On February 24, 2012, the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services reported the first three cases of an S. typhimurium outbreak. The first three culture-confirmed cases were diagnosed in two siblings aged 3 and 1, whose symptoms started on January 20 and January 24, respectively, and in an 83-year-old man whose illness started on February 2. The three strains were indistinguishable by PFGE (see Chapter 2). An investigation revealed that 19 cases, 15 confirmed and four probable, occurred during a 4-month period, and all isolates had the same electrophoretic pattern. The initial epidemiological investigation focused on several restaurants and grocery stores from the same neighborhood, where several of the affected individuals dined and shopped, but no significant findings were made. When on February 27 a neighboring jurisdiction reported a case, with a PFGE pattern matching the outbreak strain, and the person reported that within the previous 24 h she ate at the restaurant where several other cases ate, in the same neighborhood that other cases reported frequenting, an onsite visit was made to this restaurant. The restaurant owner also owned a second restaurant, which was named by two of the affected individuals. During the environmental health inspections, the owner mentioned that two of the cooks were working at both restaurants. One of these two employees tested positive for Salmonella, and the PFGE pattern of the strain matched the outbreak strain (Holman et al., 2014). The food items sampled at both restaurants tested negative, and an epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of the outbreak was this infected food handler, who was working at both restaurants. This example illustrates the complexity of epidemiological investigations and the need to pursue multiple venues when investigating the source of an outbreak (Holman et al., 2014).",

Most affected individuals ate at a restaurant chain before becoming ill, and a case\u2013control study implicated the consumption of burgers. The earliest onset of illness was in a burger bun packer at a bakery, who had not eaten at the restaurants from the chain but had worked while ill. The bakery supplied burger buns to some of the restaurants. This bakery employee was responsible for removing freshly baked bread and buns from the cooling rack, feeding them through an automatic slicer, and packaging the bread for distribution. She did not wear gloves and she handled every individual bread item. She became ill on July 13 but continued working, and after being hospitalized overnight on July 17 she continued working from July 18, when she was released, until July 23. Her brother became ill on July 17, and his primary duty was mixing the dough. He was removed from work by the Health Department on August 3.

A foodborne cyclosporidiasis outbreak that occurred in 1996 in North America was traced to raspberries imported from Guatemala (Manuel et al., 1999, Manuel et al., 2000). In the United States, 1465 cases from 20 states, the District of Columbia, and two provinces were reported during this outbreak (Herwaldt and Ackers, 1997). In the index Canadian cluster of the outbreak, eating strawberry flan, decorated with raspberries and blueberries, was associated with an increased relative risk of acquiring the infection (Manuel et al., 1999). In another example, epidemiological investigations and genotyping linked one source of imported frozen raspberries to eight independent norovirus outbreaks in Denmark between October 2010 and September 2011. Collectively, these outbreaks caused 242 cases, 32 of which were laboratory confirmed. The outbreaks occurred at different locations, including a company canteen in Viborg and Herlev, a hospital canteen in K\u00f8ge, a conference center in Aarhus, and a caf\u00e9 in Copenhagen. The vehicles in these outbreaks were raspberry cake (in Viborg), raspberry smoothie (in Aarhus and Copenhagen), raspberry mousse (in Herlev), and red cabbage salad with raw raspberries (in K\u00f8ge). Virus isolated from one patient sample had an identical RNA sequence to the virus isolated from berries. In one of these outbreaks, the raspberries originated from a bag of mixed frozen berries that had been packaged in Belgium and raw materials from Serbia, and subsequently it was determined that they came from the same batch of contaminated raspberries that was responsible for all the other outbreaks (Muller et al., 2015).",

This is illustrated by three successive gastroenteritis outbreaks with Norwalk-like viruses that occurred between May 1998 and June 1999 in a Mediterranean-style restaurant in Melbourne, Australia. In the restaurant, food was typically served on platters and eaten with fingers, from a common platter, and guests typically would move from table to table. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that each outbreak was caused by a different norovirus strain, indicating that the virus had been introduced on multiple occasions, rather than having circulated continuously. Due to the fact that the incubation period of norovirus gastroenteritis is about 24\u201348 h, short incubation periods in this study were interpreted as suggesting infection before visiting the restaurant. In the first outbreak, a guest whose fecal specimens tested positive for the norovirus had a 4-h incubation period and was thought to have been the index case. In the second outbreak, one of the guests had a 2-h incubation period, but a fecal sample was not obtained from him. In the third outbreak, a food handler was positive for the virus and could have been the source of the outbreak. The virus appears to have been introduced by guests or staff, as opposed to a long-term food reservoir (Marshall et al., 2001).",

A foodborne outbreak in Sulyyel, about 400 km from Riyadh, was reported among participants at a wedding ceremony. Nine food items and drinks had been served at the ceremony and, of these, meat, rice, and restaurant-made sweets were significantly associated with illness. Non\u2013typhoid group C Salmonella were isolated from 62 stool samples collected from individuals who became ill. Bacteria were present in stool samples from all the restaurant workers, and a health inspection revealed the lack of air conditioning and high ambient temperatures (Aljoudi et al., 2010). On September 8, 2006, an outbreak of botulism (see Chapter 19) caused by carrot juice was reported in the United States. It involved three Georgia patients who consumed carrot juice from the same bottle before becoming ill. This was followed by the recognition of botulism in a woman from Florida, on September 25, who had been hospitalized since September 16, and a few weeks later, on October 2, botulism was reported in two people from Ontario, Canada, who had been hospitalized weeks earlier in separate hospitals, and they all consumed carrot juice (Sheth et al., 2008). Type A toxin was recovered from carrot juice produced by one manufacturer, and inadequate refrigeration was implicated. This outbreak was characterized by a rapid clinical onset, and two of the patients required mechanical ventilation for over 1 year (Sheth et al., 2008). One of the bottles that was analyzed contained very high concentrations of toxin, and this was thought to explain the rapid progression and the protracted course, despite prompt antitoxin administration (Sheth et al., 2008).",

Bacterial transfer was dependent on produce type, surface moisture, and drying time but less dependent on the type of the kitchen surface. More bacteria were transferred from kitchen surfaces to produce than from produce to kitchen surfaces (Jensen et al., 2013). A study that measured Campylobacter transfer from poultry legs purchased in supermarkets to cutting boards found that transfer rates reached 81% when the product had been in contact with the cutting board for 10 min and was significantly lower when contact occurred for 1 min (Fravalo et al., 2009). In another study, both C. jejuni and C. coli were transferred from naturally contaminated raw poultry to cooked chicken via the cutting board, and transfer was detected even when the samples had low contamination levels (Guyard-Nicodeme et al., 2013).",

From the 93 patients who became ill and submitted specimens, stool cultures were positive for S. Heidelberg in 24 (26%), C. jejuni in 14 (15%), and both microorganisms in 25 (27%) (Layton et al., 1997). A case\u2013control study revealed that of six different dietary plans that were available, only the pureed diet was strongly associated with positive stool tests. From the 52 pureed food items that were prepared during the week preceding the outbreak, five meat or poultry items were most strongly associated with stool positivity. Stool samples from food handlers and environmental swabs from the kitchen facility were negative for the pathogens. During this outbreak, two nurses also developed gastrointestinal illness, and stool cultures were positive for S. Heidelberg in one of them and for C. jejuni in the other one. However, during the epidemiological investigation, a food handling error that had occurred several days earlier was unveiled. During the preparation of chopped liver salad, the chopped chicken liver had been placed into a bowl that still contained the juices from the raw chicken liver. The salad was blast-chilled and refrigerated until lunch the following day, but due to a coolant failure in the refrigerator, the temperature of the salad increased to 50\u00b0F. The chopped liver salad was the only common food that the two nurses ate in the hospital, and only residents on the pureed diet were offered chopped liver salad for lunch. It is interesting that during the investigation of this outbreak, the case\u2013control study did not identify the chopped liver salad as the source of contamination, but other findings pointed to this dish. Based on the epidemic curve, contamination of a single food item with multiple bacterial pathogens was suspected, probably due to several batches of raw chicken liver contaminated with multiple pathogens. This outbreak underscored the complexity of investigating mixed outbreaks (Layton et al., 1997).",

Another such outbreak occurred in 1968 in Jersey City, New Jersey, and was linked to a Thanksgiving dinner in the members of four related families (Janeway et al., 1971). The meal implicated in this outbreak was served to 18 people, and 17 of them became ill. Two of the victims, a 17-year-old boy and his 56-year-old mother died, and they were both had previously been in good health. The person who did not become ill ate very little and left because of an argument. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from all those who attended the dinner and from several food items, including turkey stuffing, turkey slices mixed with stuffing and gravy, peas, apple pie, pumpkin pie, and cranberry sauce. It was also isolated from environmental locations in the home and from an 8-year-old female beagle, which was not in the house where the meal was prepared and served, and did not eat any of the dinner food items but was thought to have licked the vomitus of one of the individuals. Additionally, C. perfringens was found in the turkey meat and stuffing, and Enterocccus faecalis was identified in the stuffing and in the turkey carcass (Janeway et al., 1971). Illness started between 3 and 18 h after eating the meal, with a median incubation of 7 h. While S. enteritidis was initially suspected to have caused the outbreak, the severity of the clinical manifestations was striking, considering that this pathogen mostly causes mild illness, with fatalities observed only in the very young and in those with underlying pathologies. The short incubation period and the severity of the clinical manifestations were explained by the additional involvement of one or both of the other two pathogens (Janeway et al., 1971).",

The two outbreaks occurred in February 2002 (49 illnesses) and in September 2002 (86 illnesses). Pasteurized milk and the pasteurization process were ruled out in both outbreaks, and postpasteurization contamination was implicated. In the first outbreak, L. monocytogenes was detected in 64% of the cheese samples tested and in about 19% of the environmental samples tested, including food contact surfaces where cheese was aged and nonfood contact surfaces such as drains, air vents, the area around the plant, and the adjacent farm. Environmental transmission of the pathogen is thought to have likely occurred from farm animals to personnel and from them to culture solutions used during cheese production. In the second outbreak, L. monocytogenes was detected in 76% of the cheese samples tested and in about 19% of the environmental samples collected, including an ingredient sample, water inside and outside the plant, and farm samples. Isolates that were recovered from a cistern pipe, a water-soaked rag in the milking house, and a swallow\u2019s nest matched the PFGE profile of the outbreak strain (McIntyre et al., 2015). Birds were identified in the second outbreak as likely having contaminated the dairy plant\u2019s water supply and the cheese during the curd-washing step (McIntyre et al., 2015).",

In addition to the fecal-oral route, rotaviruses are transmitted by nonenteral routes, which include fomites and the respiratory route (Dennehy, 2000, Prince et al., 1986). The stability of viruses in aerosols is relevant for their transmission. A study that examined the stability of aerosolized rotavirus reported that at 20\u00b0C, the half-life of an aerosolized human rotavirus strain was about 44 h at a relative humidity of 50% but decreased to about 24 h at a relative humidity of 30% and to about 3.8 h at a relative humidity of 80%. When fecally suspended virus was aerosolized, almost 80% of the airborne virus particles remained infectious after 24 h at 20\u00b0C and a relative humidity of 50% (Ijaz et al., 1985). In another study on aerosolized rotavirus, a relative humidity of 50% was optimal for survival, with 45% of the virus remaining viable after 72 h and 3% after 9 days. At 25% relative humidity, \u223c21% of the virus was viable after 72 h, while at 80% relative humidity, 50% of the virus was not detectable after 2 h (Sattar et al., 1984). Rotavirus RNA has been detected in air samples taken from the hospital rooms of rotavirus-infected children, suggesting that airborne spread may play a role in hospital and daycare settings (Dennehy et al., 1998). Aerosolization is also an important transmission route for noroviruses, which represent an underestimated cause of viral gastroenteritis (see Chapter 14). Airborne Norwalk-like gastroenteritis outbreaks have been reported in which airborne spread of the virus was the most likely possibility (Marks et al., 2000, Marks et al., 2003).",

Aerobic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were most prevalent in samples collected near hide removal areas, suggesting that hide removal likely introduces pathogens into the air by the dispersion of liquid droplets, and could be a source of hide-to-carcass contamination (Schmidt et al., 2012). Similarly, a nationwide survey conducted in Japan to assess Salmonella prevalence in airborne dust from layer farms surveyed 203 farms between December 2004 and March 2005 and found that 48 (23.6%) of them were positive for Salmonella (Iwabuchi et al., 2010). Experimental studies also supported the possibility of nose-to-nose transmission of S. typhimurium among pigs (Oliveira et al., 2006, Oliveira et al., 2007) and turkeys (Harbaugh et al., 2006).",

Infant botulism is the most frequent form encountered (Lawrence et al., 2007) and is a life-threatening condition that usually occurs in infants younger than 12 months (Goonetilleke and Harris, 2004, Fenicia and Anniballi, 2009). Honey and environmental exposure are the main routes of acquiring the microorganisms (Brook, 2007, Tanzi and Gabay, 2002). Adult intestinal colonization botulism is similar to infant botulism and mostly occurs in adults with changes in the intestinal flora, including previous surgery, Crohn disease, achlorhydria, or recent antibiotic treatment (Cherington, 1998, Chia et al., 1986, Lawrence et al., 2007). Wound botulism, caused by wound contamination with Clostridium botulinum spores, is usually associated with trauma or intravenous drug use (Burningham et al., 1994, Lawrence et al., 2007) (see Chapter 19).",

Pruno is prepared by fermentation from water, fruit, sugar, and miscellaneous ingredients (Walters et al., 2015). It was first recognized as a vehicle for botulism in 2004 and 2005, in two outbreaks from California (Vugia et al., 2009). The first outbreak, at the California state prison in Riverside County, affected four men who drank from the same batch of pruno and developed clinical manifestations 3 days later. Two of the men required intubation and all four survived. The second outbreak, at a California state prison in Monterey County, affected a man who required intubation and survived (Vugia et al., 2009). In early October 2011, foodborne botulism was diagnosed in eight maximum security prison inmates from the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah (Prevention, 2012). Several batches of pruno were circulating among the inmates, and one of them had been prepared from oranges, grapefruit, canned fruit, water, powdered drink mix, and a baked potato. The baked potato was the only one of these ingredients that had not been used in other pruno batches, and an investigation revealed that the toxin was most likely produced when the potato was added to a mixture of the other ingredients under low-acidity, anaerobic conditions during fermentation (Prevention, 2012). Another outbreak occurred in late November 2012 in Arizona, when eight inmates from a maximum security prison developed botulism after drinking pruno from a single batch (Prevention, 2013).\n",

Noroviruses are the most frequent causes of acute viral gastroenteritis and foodborne disease in most of the world (Moore et al., 2015). They are often spread by food, and among simple foods, transmission occurs mostly by fresh vegetables (30\u201340%), fruits and nuts (10\u201320%), mollusks (10\u201315%), and dairy (5\u201315%) (see Chapter 14). In addition to their foodborne transmission, noroviruses can also be transmitted by the person-to-person route (Moore et al., 2015). A study that analyzed 2895 norovirus outbreaks with a known transmission route that occurred in the United States between 2009 and 2013 reported that person-to-person transmission could be documented in 2425 (83.7%) and foodborne transmissions in 465 (16.1%) of these outbreaks (Vega et al., 2014). In another analysis, of 552 outbreaks documented in 20 states from the United States between 2009 and 2010, foodborne transmission occurred in 78 (14%) and person-to-person transmission in 340 (62%) cases, whereas the transmission route was not reported for the 134 remaining outbreaks (Vega et al., 2011).",

In other words, it was thought that an infected individual has more or less equal chances of infecting susceptible contacts and that each susceptible contact is more or less equally likely to become infected (Bolzoni et al., 2007). However, the number of infectious diseases for which heterogeneity in transmission has been documented is growing (Chao et al., 2013, Garske and Rhodes, 2008, Liebman et al., 2014). One of the key observations on the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks at the population level is superspreading, a phenomenon that has been described for many pathogens and in many host species, including humans, animals, birds, and plants (Capparelli et al., 2009, Cronin et al., 2010, Paull et al., 2012, Reisen et al., 2009, Stein, 2011). Early in the 20th century, Mary Mallon, more widely known as Typhoid Mary, infected at least 54 people with S. typhi and became the first and perhaps the best documented superspreader (Gonzalez-Escobedo et al., 2011, Marineli et al., 2013, Paull et al., 2012).",

The bovine rectoanal junction is located between the descending colon and the anal canal, and marks the abrupt transition between two cell types, the follicle-associated columnar epithelium toward the distal colon and the nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium toward the anal canal (Kudva and Dean-Nystrom, 2011, Kudva et al., 2012). Even after exposure to doses of bacteria as high as 1010\n CFU, cattle remain asymptomatic (Baines et al., 2008). As a result, some colonized animals become supershedders and disperse very large numbers of bacteria, exceeding 104\n CFU/g of feces (Arthur et al., 2010, Cote et al., 2015, Munns et al., 2015, Naylor et al., 2003).",

In another study, 9% of cattle were high shedders, defined in the study as shedding more than 104\n CFU/g, and these highly shedding animals were accountable for more than 96% of the bacteria that were isolated from all the animals tested (Omisakin et al., 2003). These results underscored that the high level of shedding in some animals may be of much higher importance than the infection prevalence of an entire cattle population (Omisakin et al., 2003).",

This suggested that interpreting cattle prevalence data in isolation might not accurately reflect their reservoir potential and the risk of human infection. Even though the number of high-shedding cattle was similar during the cold and the warm months, high-shedding cattle were dispersing, on average, 6 times more bacteria during the summer than during the winter. This trend mirrored the number of reported human infections and pointed toward the need to determine not only the prevalence of shedding in cattle but also the extent of shedding (Ogden et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Supershedding in cattle is shaped by the bacterial strain, the host, and the environment (Munns et al., 2015). For example, analyses of fecal samples in cattle from Scottish farms found a link between E. coli O157 phage type 21/28 and supershedding (Chase-Topping et al., 2007, Chase-Topping et al., 2008, Halliday et al., 2006). A study that sequenced the whole genome of SS17, a supershedder E. coli O157 strain, and compared it with several reference strains identified a genomic signature comprising about 60 genomic targets that could help understand the mechanistic bases of virulence and superspreading (Cote et al., 2015). Host-specific and rearing environment risk factors may also be responsible for high shedding (Chase-Topping et al., 2007, Williams et al., 2014). An important factor that influences supershedding is diet composition (Braden et al., 2004, Jacob et al., 2008, Callaway et al., 2009, Jeong et al., 2011, Munns et al., 2015). Corn-fed cattle had lower average fecal pH and higher fecal E. coli O157:H7 concentrations than did barley-fed cattle (Berg et al., 2004). Hay-fed cattle experimentally infected with E. coli O157:H7 shed the bacteria for longer than did grain-fed animals, and all animals remained healthy (Hovde et al., 1999). Increased fermentation in the hindgut, making the environment less hospitable for bacterial survival (Fox et al., 2007), is one suggested reason for this latter observation. This illustrate that many factors shape supershedding and superspreading, and these are influenced by intricate mechanisms.",

            "text": "Understanding the transmission routes of foodborne pathogens is a challenging, thought-provoking, and critical aspect for food sciences, clinical medicine, and public health. While identifying the source of an outbreak is decisive for successfully limiting it and for preventing recurrences, implementation of the interventions is often delayed or complicated by various factors, such as the increased distances to which food products are transported, the increasing global mobility of populations, and the many processes and locations that are often involved in food preparation. This is compounded by the existence of several transmission routes and various transmission vehicles that can be exploited by certain pathogens. More than 250 known foodborne diseases affect one-third of the world population, and some segments of the population, particularly the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, are an a heightened risk, pointing toward the relevance of these conditions for medicine and public health. Foodborne illnesses can be transmitted through vectors, fomites, contaminated food products, directly by person-to-person contact, from animals, or through the airborne route. As an additional layer of complexity in transmission at the level of populations, in what became known as the \u201c20/80 rule,\u201d for most infectious disease outbreaks that have been studied, a minority of hosts was found to be responsible for most transmission events. These heterogeneities in transmission have been observed in both human and animal populations, and understanding their dynamics promises to be transformative for the successful implementation of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.",
