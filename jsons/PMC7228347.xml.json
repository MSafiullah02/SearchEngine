A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen,\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On 11 February 2020, WHO named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as \u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d (coronavirus disease 2019). On the basis of phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and renamed it as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n7\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to species of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus (SARSr\u2010CoV) and genus Betacoronavirus.\n2\n COVID\u201019 rapidly triggered a global health emergency alert and spread to 46 countries by 27 February 2020. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. Like SARS\u2010CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is responsible for lower respiratory infection and can cause acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). Other human coronaviruses (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are responsible for upper respiratory infections and common cold.\n8\n\n",

The total case\u2010fatality rate is 3.46% as shown in Table 1. Because COVID\u201019 started from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province with a large population of nearly 14 million people, 58.3% cases are in Wuhan. A total of 1932 health workers have been infected in Wuhan alone,\n9\n which overwhelmed the local health system and resulted in the highest case\u2010fatality rate (4.42%). Excluding Hubei province, the rest of China has 13 045 cases, 109 fatalities (0.84%). Outside of China, COVID\u201019 has spread to 46 countries and has caused 3664 infections and 67 fatalities (1.83%). Overall, the case\u2010fatality rate of COVID\u201019 so far is much lower than either SARS (9.6%) or MERS (34.5%).\n10\n Here, we summarized common and discrete features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in comparison to its two predecessors (SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV) in genetics, epidemiology, clinical features, and further discussed challenges for diagnosis and special control measures for COVID\u201019.",

According to the sixth version of the guidance for diagnosis and treatments for COVID\u201019 issued by the National Health Commission of China, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was transmitted through respiratory aspirates, droplets, contacts, and feces, and aerosols transmission is highly possible. Chan et al\n6\n reported that six familial members got COVID\u201019, but none of them had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. On the bais of data from China CDC, 58.3% of COVID\u201019 cases are in Wuhan, while the rest of cases are imported from Wuhan. Wuhan is the capital of China's Hubei province, with over 14 million inhabitants, and is a major transportation hub, which increases person\u2010to\u2010person contacts and adds to the possibility of exporting cases to other locations. The early outbreak data largely followed the exponential growth before the implementation of quarantine strategies by governments on 24 January 2020. The basic reproductive values (R0) of COVID\u201019 at the early stage were calculated between 2 and 3.5, indicating that one patient could transmit the disease to two to three other people,\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n which was higher than SARS and MERS. Phylodynamic analysis based on 52 genomic sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains sampled in different countries publicly available at GISAID showed the estimated mean evolutionary rate was 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 subs/site/year (range 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 15 \u00d7 10\u22124), which was in line with that of SARS and MERS, and the mean time of the most recent common ancestor was 73 days.\n21\n With enforced implementation of isolation strategies, R0 was expected to decline in coming days.

Nosocomial infections extremely burdened the health system and hindered early infected individuals from getting immediate medical supports, therefore resulting in high case\u2010fatality rate in Wuhan as shown in Table 1. In Wuhan alone, 1080 health workers were infected, in return case\u2010fatality rate of Wuhan is the highest.
