During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems have begun crisis management planning. To appropriately allocate resources and prevent virus exposure while maintaining effective patient care, our orthopaedic surgery department rapidly introduced a robust telemedicine program during a 5-day period. Implementation requires attention to patient triage, technological resources, credentialing, education of providers and patients, scheduling, and regulatory considerations. This article provides practical instruction based on our experience for physicians who wish to implement telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between telemedicine encounters and necessary in-person visits, providers may be able to achieve 50% of their typical clinic volume within 2 weeks. When handling the massive disruption to the routine patient care workflow, it is critical to understand the key factors associated with an accelerated introduction of telemedicine for the safe and effective continuation of orthopaedic care during this pandemic.",

Given the rapid global spread beginning in late 2019 and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , especially among the elderly, the US healthcare system has braced for impact. 5 With anecdotal reports of shortages of supplies and personnel in Italy and China, as well as parts of the United States, hospital systems have anticipated the sequestering of healthcare resources and personnel. 6 To limit the exposure of patients and practitioners to SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce resource consumption, the American College of Surgeons, in conjunction with the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has encouraged the postponement or cancellation of all elective surgical procedures and clinics to focus resources on urgent and emergency patient care only. 7 Telemedicine is defined as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients through telecommunications technology. 8, 9 In the COVID-19 scenario, telemedicine helps conserve healthcare resources, such as personal protective equipment, continue safe and high-quality patient care, and maintain social distancing to minimize virus spread. In the field of orthopaedic surgery, telemedicine has previously been used to provide \"virtual clinics\" in rural Iowa 10 and Norway 11 and for follow-up after total joint arthro-plasty. 12 Approximately half 2 of US hospitals use telemedicine, primarily in the field of radiology, in which remote diagnosis can be achieved via cloud-based imaging systems; however, this communication is largely physician to physician, not physician to patient. During the current crisis, telemedicine has been used to screen for COVID-19 symptoms and to prescribe testing, and its use for other types of care has rapidly expanded. 13 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services has temporarily suspended some Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and also extended the nature of patient visits suitable for telehealth (Table 1) . 14 The use of telemedicine allows providers to maintain continuity of patient care while triaging patients in preparation for an anticipated case backlog after crisis abatement. In an effort to appropriately allocate resources and prevent virus exposure while maintaining safe, efficient, and effective patient care, our department has urgently introduced a robust telemedicine program.",

A crucial element of telemedicine effectiveness is careful patient selection. Each orthopaedic division within our department created guidelines for determining which patients may require inperson visits, which can be served via telemedicine, and which are appropriate to be rescheduled for after crisis abatement (Table 1) . Common reasons that patients were deemed ineligible for telehealth visits were the need for suture or staple removal, the need for a cast change, and the need for a hands-on clinical examination to determine appropriate treatment of an acute injury. Patients who required imaging were assessed on an individual basis to determine whether imaging would best be performed at our clinic (prompting an in-person visit) or at an imaging center near the patient's home (with remote review of images via a HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based platform). Most standard wound checks, range-of-motion checks, and standard postoperative visits do not require in-person visits and are deemed appropriate for telemedicine. Patients whose scenarios are indeterminate are offered a telemedicine visit for remote triage to decide whether an in-person visit is necessary. Each patient who must be seen in the clinic is screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before entering the clinical care area.",

One of the first priorities is to determine the technology resources available in the practice. Each provider requires a device with a functioning camera and microphone, and computing power similar to that required for common video-chat applications, such as Skype (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) or FaceTime (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Providers who intend to perform video visits from a patient care area, such as an office examination room, may consider using a lens cover to avoid unintentionally capturing video of other patients. Our department purchased several additional cameras with lens covers for this purpose. In addition to testing the microphone's audio and camera's video quality, we found it helpful to test each device to ensure adequate bandwidth to support video transfer, particularly in remote locations such as providers' homes.",

For example, our health system uses Epic software (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) and hosts a HIPAA-compliant remote patient portal. Through this portal, patients connect remotely through the Polycom RealPresence application (Plantronics, Santa Cruz, CA) for a secure, synchronous (realtime) audiovisual encounter. EMRlinked telehealth applications have the advantages of HIPAA compliance and integration with the patient's medical record for documentation and billing purposes. Server requirements for such a platform included 16 physical cores and at least 2.0-GHz speed, and 16 virtual cores to support approximately six simultaneous encounters. Practices running an EMR typically have adequate server capacity to support remote video visits without interfering with office operations. Anecdotally, when running a HIPAA-compliant platform through our practice's server, we have experienced an audiovisual delay of approximately 1 second during video visits. This delay may not impair the Simulate check-in and visit process quality of the visit but occasionally interrupts the smooth flow of discussion. 15, 16 For practices not using an EMR system, more basic teleconferencing software may be preferable, which may not require this server capacity.",

Cellular connections that can support FaceTime or WhatsApp (Facebook, Menlo Park, CA) are adequate for providers and patients using telemedicine. When using these commercial applications, however, documentation of the encounter within the medical record is still necessary.",

Alternatively, \"e-visits\" are those in which established patients communicate asynchronously via an online patient messaging portal. As of March 6, 2020, temporary legislation (ie, a 1,135 Waiver) was enacted, allowing for telehealth parity during this crisis. 17 During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will reimburse physicians for services rendered through telehealth at the same rate as in-person visits, for all diagnoses. Additional relaxation of restrictions on telemedicine visit requirements by CMS during the COVID-19 crisis include the following: allowing for new visits to be performed remotely, easing \"originating site\" (ie, the patient's location at the time of the visit) requirements to allow telemedicine for patients who were not in rural locations or within another healthcare facility, and suspension of interstate licensing laws (paving the way for states to allow providers to practice telemedicine across state lines if certain criteria are met) ( Table 5) . 18 State licensure laws still apply during this time, although as individual states have declared healthcare emergencies, many have suspended or altered restrictions on providers with valid licenses in other states or jurisdictions providing telehealth services across state lines. This flexibility has been important for our department because approximately 19% of our patients travel from other states for their orthopaedic care. Continued daily updates on regulatory changes, as well as an online posting of frequently asked billing, coding, and regulatory questions, are provided by our department's \"physician champion\" to our practitioners to keep all informed during this period of frequent changes. 17 ",

Considering both telemedicine and in-person visits, we estimate that most providers will achieve nearly 50% of their typical clinic volume within 2 weeks of implementation. The 50% of patients visits not completed via telemedicine or in person has consisted predominantly of nonurgent follow-up and routine postoperative visits. These patients can be safely managed with asynchronous (messaging or e-mail) communication or postponement until the COVID-19 crisis has abated. [17] [18] [19] Summary As we adapt to the quickly evolving challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we embrace the flexibility that is imperative for crisis management. The pandemic has upended routines and patterns in our department and removed the barriers of inertia that would have prevented such major changes in our practice. The marked disruption of our ability to continue routine patient care drove the accelerated introduction of novel tools to provide evaluation and treatment involving a concerted effort across all orthopaedic divisions. We are still learning and troubleshooting our new workflows, but telemedicine has been critical to the safe and effective continuation of orthopaedic care during this challenging time. We hope that, by using such technology, we can continue serving our patients with musculoskeletal conditions while reducing infection risk and the burden on our healthcare system.",

Since the initial provider setup, the greatest continuing challenge has been managing the cameras, microphones, and software on patients' devices to allow HIPAA-compliant video communication. In recognition of the learning curve involved with telemedicine, the number of remote visits was limited at first. New clinic templates were developed to facilitate telemedicine visits. Within the first 2 weeks, most providers scheduled approximately three remote synchronous visits per day, with encounters scheduled hourly to allow time to troubleshoot and orient to the new interface. As our provider workflows have become more streamlined, each provider is paired with a medical office coordinator or medical assistant to help prepare patients for remote visits. Office coordinators and medical assistants were taught how to help patients set up their telecommunications software, test their devices, and check-in online. Patients are contacted 10 minutes before the scheduled encounter to help them prepare and to answer any questions. This format has worked well during the first 2 weeks, with visits now commonly scheduled every 30 minutes. Most providers are templated for blocks of 2 to 3 consecutive hours of remote encounters on specific days of the week.",
