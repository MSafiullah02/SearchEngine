            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human and animal pathogens that have the ability to emerge and cross the species barrier, causing novel and occasionally fatal diseases [1,2]. They belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae of the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales [3]. According to the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), coronaviruses are classified into four genera including, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus (contains 4 lineages A, B, C and D), gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus [4]. They are large enveloped viruses with a large single-stranded RNA, 5\u2032-capped, non-segmented genome with positive polarity ranging from 26 to 32 kb in size [5]. While CoVs from all genera infect a large number of mammals and birds, bats are proposed to be their natural reservoir [6,7]. In humans, on the other hand, only alpha and beta CoVs have been associated with diseases ranging from mild common cold to fatal severe respiratory infections. Two human alpha CoVs (hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63) and two beta CoVs (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1) are associated with common cold [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. In 2002 and 2012, two novel highly pathogenic beta CoVs known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) emerged in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. These two viruses have spread widely and were associated with severe respiratory diseases with mild to severe and fatal outcomes. More recently, a novel human CoV known as severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China as the third known highly pathogenic human beta CoV [16].",

Until April 10th, more than 1,6 million COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported globally, including more than 100,000 deaths. There are currently no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 [17]. The rapid global spread of this virus and the worrisome associated mortality rate encouraged the medical community and policy makers to expediate the process of exploring all available and potential interventions to control and mitigate this outbreak [18]. Several interventional treatment options for COVID-19 have been suggested with unclear efficacy and safety considerations [19]. Recent publications have suggested using chloroquine (CQ), a broadly used antimalarial drug, and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a treatment for COVID-19 patients [[20], [21], [22]]. In this review, we explore the antiviral activities of CQ and HCQ against CoVs and non-CoVs in the majority of previously published in vitro, in vivo and clinical trial studies with an aim to find evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Both CQ and HCQ, known antimalarial and antirheumatic drugs, have closely related chemical structures [22]. However, their mechanisms of action are still not fully elucidated. Several studies have revealed that both drugs have antiviral activity in vitro through different mechanisms [[23], [24], [25]]. In particular, CQ has been shown to interfere with different stages of the viral life cycle as shown in Fig. 1\n[[26], [27], [28], [29]]. Different studies have reported the ability of CQ to inhibit viral entry [[30], [31], [32]], uncoating [33], assembly and budding [34,35]. One of the suggested mechanisms by which CQ can affect the entry step of viruses is by inhibiting quinone reductase 2 [36], which is required for the biosynthesis of sialic acid [37]. Sialic acid was found to be involved in virus attachment and entry into host cells by several viruses including HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV [38,39]. Moreover, CQ was shown to potently inhibit entry of SARS-CoV into cells by interfering with the glycosylation of its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry, suggesting a possible similar effect of CQ on SARS-CoV-2 at this step of virus replication [40]. CQ can also affect early stage of virus replication by inhibiting virus-endosome fusion, likely via increasing endosomal pH [41]. CoVs such as SARS-CoV were shown to be able to enter target cells via pH-dependent mechanism in which the acidic pH of the lysosome triggers fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes resulting in viral particle uncoating and subsequent release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm [42]. CQ can also impair posttranslational modifications of viral proteins through interfering with proteolytic processes [43] and inhibition of glycosylation via specific interactions with sugar-modifying enzymes or glycosyltransferases [28]. CQ can also hamper lysosomal protein degradation and lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes [[44], [45], [46]]. Moreover, it has been suggested that CQ has the ability to affect the cytotoxic mechanisms and works as anti-autophagy agent in vitro [47]. CQ works as anti-inflammatory agent through reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) release and suppressing TNF receptors on monocytes [26,28].",

HCQ can also impede major histocompatibility complex (MCH) class II expression which inhibits T cell activation, expression of CD145 and cytokines release [[48], [49], [50]]. Furthermore, HCQ has been shown to impair Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling through increasing endosomal pH and interfering with TLR7 and TLR9 binding to their DNA/RNA ligands thereby inhibiting transcription of pro-inflammatory genes [[51], [52], [53]]. The aforementioned immunomodulatory properties of CQ and HCQ have raised the interest in using these drugs in COVID-19 patients at risk of cytokines release syndrome (CRS) [22].",

            "text": "The fact that both CQ and HCQ are considered for the management of COVID-19 patients clearly highlights the need to better understand their pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters. However, a full understanding of these parameters has been challenging despite the numerous reported studies. Generally, PK parameters for CQ and HCQ are comparable (Table 1\n) [54,55]. Following oral administration of CQ and HCQ, their bioavailability can reach up to 80% with plasma peak time around 2\u20134 h [[56], [57], [58]]. Thus, parenteral administration, if available, might be a better route especially that oral administration has shown huge interpatient variability [56,59,60]. The long half-life of both CQ and HCQ which could range from 30 to 60 days is likely attributed to their large volume of distribution (200\u2013800 L/kg) and extensive tissue uptake [[61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68]]. CQ and HCQ are metabolized via CYP-450 enzymes to other active compounds, which are responsible for the extended pharmacological actions and increased toxicity [61,69]. Up to 60% of CQ and HCQ is primarily excreted renally as unchanged or metabolized forms, and the remaining (40%) is usually cleared through the liver, feces and skin or stored in other lean body tissues [54,[69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74]]. It's important to note that CQ and HCQ have a chiral center, which produces two enantiomers R(\u2212) or S(+) forms or isomers [75], in which little is known about the differences in their pharmacological activity and their corresponding metabolites. Most clinically used CQ and HCQ exist as a racemic mixture (50:50) of both isomers which complicates the understanding of their PK and associated toxicity as they could behave differently inside the body [57,[75], [76], [77]].",

Nevertheless, over the years CQ and HCQ have maintained a good safety profile when used in several chronic diseases such as RA and SLE. Despite some animal experiments suggesting that HCQ is probably less toxic than CQ, there is a lack of high quality evidence from clinical trials supporting this claim [74,[84], [85], [86], [87]]. These toxicities could be related to the very long half-life and the large volume of distribution of both drugs. One of the significant toxic effects of CQ and HCQ is the possible ocular pigmentation due to their binding to melanin, which could lead to damage in different parts of the eye including the cornea, ciliary body and retina [88]. Notably, the incidence of such ocular toxicity is usually rare. For instance, it was shown that only 0.5% out of \u223c400 patients treated with HCQ (\u22646.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 years due to RA or SLE had developed ocular related complications [89]. Most studies have shown that such complications might only occur with long term treatment of chronic diseases which extends for more than 5 years with doses above or equal to 6.5 mg/kg/day [90,91]. However, ocular toxicity and changes could still occur with shorter treatments. Other complications such as development of proximal myopathy associated with respiratory failure have also been reported in patients treated with either CQ or HCQ [[92], [93], [94], [95]]. Nonetheless, most of these complications were seen in elderly patients with an average age of 70 years suffering from chronic RA or autoimmune diseases. Both CQ and HCQ were also shown to be associated with rare but life-threatening cardiomyopathy [[96], [97], [98]]. Other less reported CQ and HCQ toxicities include urticaria [99], ototoxicity [100,101] and some neurological effects [102,103].",

Since then, several studies have tested the ability of CQ and HCQ to inhibit the replication of a wide range of CoVs and non-CoV viruses in vitro as shown in Table 2, Table 3\n, respectively. The majority of these studies have revealed a substantial ability of CQ and HCQ as well as some of their derivatives to inhibit viral replication with no to low toxicity. Specifically, CQ has been shown to inhibit the replication of different CoVs including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 among others in several studies (Table 2) [37,[104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115]]. Only two studies showed no significant inhibitory effects of CQ on MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV4) [116,117]. Other CQ derivatives such as amodiaquine (AMD), Ferroquine (FQ), Hydroxy ferroquine (HFQ) have been also shown to exerts some antiviral activity [105,106]. Interestingly enough, while HCQ does not seem to have a significant effect in reducing SARS-CoV and Feline CoV replication [106], it was recently shown to have a potent in vitro inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 replication [112,116].",

            "text": "Similarly, these compounds have shown excellent in vitro antiviral activity against several non CoV (mostly RNA viruses) with low toxicity in most cases (Table 3). For instance, HIV was shown to be inhibited by CQ alone or in combination with HCQ, hydroxyurea (HU1), didanosine (ddI), zidovudine (ZDV), indinavir (IDV), saquinavir (SQV) or ritonavir (RTV) [106,[118], [119], [120], [121], [122]]. While other derivatives such as HCQ and HFQ have been also shown to inhibit HIV replication [106,123,124], one study showed no effect of HCQ and FQ on HIV [106]. Similarly, it was found that CQ could enhance Epstein-Barr virus replication [125]. Furthermore, another study has suggested possible enhanced HIV replication with CQ treatment through protection of tat protein from proteolytic degradation [126]. Influenza A and B viruses have also been shown to be inhibited by CQ [27,[127], [128], [129], [130], [131]] although contradicting results have been seen for some subtypes and strains such as avian H7N3 strains (A/Mallard/It/43/01 and A/Ty/It/220158/02) [106,130]. Several other studies have also reported in vitro inhibitory effect of CQ on multiple viruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [41,132,133], zika virus (ZIKV) [[134], [135], [136]], Ebola virus (EBOV) [[137], [138], [139]], dengue viruses (DENV) in mammalian cells [43,140,141] but not insect cells [141] as well as several others [43,139,[142], [143], [144], [145], [146], [147], [148], [149], [150]]. Nonetheless, some reports failed to observe antiviral activity of CQ, HCQ and FQ on several other viruses including polio virus, reovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), herpes simplex viruses, coxsackie virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus, sindbis virus, parainfluenza-3 virus and Punta Toro virus [106,151].",

Some studies have demonstrated antiviral efficacy of CQ in influenza A virus H5N1, ZIKV and EBOV infected mice [29,134,139]. Interestingly, CQ was effective against ZIKV in both wild type and IFNAR deficient mice, and protected infected suckling pups from infection and microcephaly when given to their mothers [29,134,136]. However, several other studies showed no significant antiviral effect of CQ against influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in mice and Ferrets, respectively [129]. Similarly, CQ was ineffective against EBOV in guinea pigs, mice and hamsters [137,138], Nipah virus (NiV) in Ferrets and hamsters [148,153], Hendra virus (HeV) in hamsters [148], CHIKV in cynomolgus macaques [133], Lassa virus (LASV) in mice [139] and Semliki Forest Virus (SIV) in mice [154]. Importantly, most of these previous in vivo studies showed toxicity in animals [129,133,137,138,154]. Furthermore, it was shown that CQ could lead to disease exacerbation correlating with increased type I IFN response and delayed immune responses in CHIKV infected macaques [133], increased mortality rate of SFV-infected mice [154] and NiV or HeV infected hamsters [148].",

On the other hand, few studies have reported that HCQ could decease HIV-1 viremia, stabilize CD4 T cell count and reduce IL-6 and IgG levels in infected patients [159], although others showed contradicting finding of increased HIV RNAemia in HCQ treated patients [160,161]. Interestingly, while few clinical studies have suggested that the use of HCQ alone or with azithromycin (AZT) could be beneficial for COVID-19 patients as it reduces viral shedding and time to clinical recovery [[162], [163], [164]], others have reported no effect in infected patients [165,166]. However, it is important to note that most of these studies have several limitations in study designs with small sample sizes. Nonetheless, around 104 clinical trials are ongoing in different countries to asses and evaluate the therapeutic and prophylactic effects of both CQ and/or HCQ in COVID-19 patients (Table 6\n).",

While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary [20,162,163].

Nevertheless, while our literature review showed that this is quite rare, it is not yet evident whether there would be any additive or possible synergistic risk when these drugs are combined with other medications such as AZT [83]. In fact, it is challenging to base a treatment decision in the absence of a complete research cycle and a clear vision of drug efficacy and safety. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rational the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.",

HCQ can interfere with lysosomal activity and prevent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, (7) CQ interferes with TNF release and binding from macrophages and/to monocytes, (8) CQ inhibits phosphorylation of P38 MAPK and caspase in Th1 cells which in turn inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines production and virus replication, (9) HCQ blocking of MCH expression prevents T cell activation, expression of CD145 and cytokines release, (10) HCQ impairs TLR signaling through increasing endosomal pH and interfering with TLR7 and TLR9 binding to their DNA/RNA ligands thereby inhibiting transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, (11) HCQ inhibits the binding of DNA to the cGAS and therefore reduce cytokines transcription and production.
