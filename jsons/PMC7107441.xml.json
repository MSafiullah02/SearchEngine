Most affected children in epidemiologic studies of pneumonia are less than 5 years of age. Disease incidence among this age group is higher than at any other age, including adults over 65 years [1]. Among older children, disease burden is substantially decreased and continues to decline through young adulthood. Other risk factors include poor nutritional status, low housing quality (eg, overcrowding, environmental exposures), secondhand smoke exposure, comorbidities such as asthma, and preceding upper respiratory tract infection [2\u20137].",

            "text": "Clinical signs and symptoms associated with pneumonia include fever, cough, tachypnea, grunting, retractions, hypoxia, abdominal pain, decreased breath sounds, and crackles or rales [8\u201316]. In the absence of at least 1 of these signs or symptoms, the likelihood of pneumonia is exceptionally low. Several definitions have been proposed to identify community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [17]. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are widely used in the developing world and are intended to identify young children with high suspicion of clinical pneumonia in resource-limited settings in which radiography and laboratory testing are not available [18]. According to these criteria, children less than 5 years of age with cough or difficulty breathing and with documented tachypnea at rest are classified as having pneumonia. Severe pneumonia is defined as the presence of chest indrawing, and very severe pneumonia is defined as chest indrawing and either an inability to drink, severe malnutrition, stridor at rest, convulsions, or change in mental status. Applying the WHO case definition to a cohort of children less than 5 years of age presenting to a US emergency department with suspicion of pneumonia, Wingerter et al [19] reported a sensitivity and specificity of 34% and 74%, respectively, for the WHO case definition when using radiographically confirmed pneumonia as the reference standard. Reducing the age-based respiratory rate by 10 breaths per minute to define tachypnea for the WHO case definition improved sensitivity (54%\u201367%) but reduced specificity (41%\u201362%), whereas addition of fever did not substantially alter performance characteristics. A similar study conducted in Brazil reported sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 19%, respectively, for radiographically confirmed pneumonia; addition of fever to the WHO case definition improved specificity (46%) without impacting sensitivity (81%) [20]. Thus, although the WHO case definition may be appropriate in resource-limited settings, its application in the developed world is more problematic. The case definition is highly dependent on documented tachypnea, the most sensitive clinical sign for diagnosing pneumonia (40%\u201378% for radiographic-confirmed pneumonia) [21\u201324]. However, specificity of tachypnea alone is relatively poor, meaning that most children with tachypnea will not have pneumonia. The recent studies by Wingerter et al [19] and Cardoso et al [20] suggest that the addition of fever to the WHO case definition would not impact sensitivity and may improve specificity.",

            "text": "Chest radiography is routinely used to confirm the diagnosis of CAP in the developed world. Radiographically confirmed pneumonia is a more specific definition that does not appreciably impact sensitivity, although occasionally radiographic findings lag behind clinical features. Chest radiography may also provide etiologic clues (Table 1; Figures 1\u20133). Nevertheless, without a pathogen isolated from the lower respiratory tract, the \u201creference standard\u201d definition of fever, respiratory signs and symptoms, and acute infiltrates on chest radiography is not absolute, because other illnesses may cause similar presentations (eg, acute asthma exacerbated by viral upper respiratory illness) and radiographic interpretation is subject to human variation. Radiography should not supplant clinical judgment, especially in the outpatient setting where it may serve only to delay therapy, increase costs, and expose children to unnecessary ionizing radiation. Rather, chest radiography should be reserved for those children in whom the diagnosis is in question, or for those more critically ill children who require hospitalization. In the latter, chest radiography may reveal complications requiring intervention or prolonged antibiotic therapy (eg, effusion, abscess) or findings suggestive of certain etiologies (eg, pneumatoceles in staphylococcal pneumonia). Chest radiography is also essential in epidemiologic and clinical studies to ensure accurate disease identification, and the WHO has developed criteria to standardize chest radiograph interpretation for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children [25]. These standardized definitions have also been applied in the clinical setting. The finding of alveolar infiltrate had substantial interrater agreement (\u03ba = 0.58\u20130.73 across studies) [26\u201328]. In contrast, the finding of interstitial infiltrate had poor interobserver reliability. These studies highlight the importance of clarifying the presence or absence of alveolar infiltrates in particular when interpreting chest radiographs.\n",

Several studies have demonstrated ultrasound to be equivalent to traditional chest radiography for detecting signs of lung consolidation and superior in the detection of pleural effusions [29\u201331]. In addition, chest ultrasound may facilitate detection of retrocardiac and lung base opacities, areas difficult to discern with radiography, and does not expose children to ionizing radiation. Chest computed tomography provides an exceptionally detailed view of the lung parenchyma, bronchial tree, pleural spaces, and adjacent structures, but at the expense of high levels of ionizing radiation. As a result, computed tomography is not routinely indicated although it may offer valuable additional information in selected cases, such as children with recurrent or nonresponding pneumonia.",

Most effusions are small and do not require drainage. However, approximately 5% of hospitalized children with pneumonia develop larger effusions or empyema that can lead to respiratory compromise [33]. Lung abscess and bronchopleural fistulae are uncommon. Systemic complications, including sepsis and respiratory failure, occur in 5%\u201330% of children hospitalized with pneumonia, which occurs much more frequently among young children [33, 41]. After the introduction of PCV7, systemic complications have declined, although these declines have been offset by substantial increases in local complications, especially parapneumonic effusion and empyema [33, 42\u201346]. Secondary sites of infection (eg, meningitis) and other metastatic complications (eg, pneumococcal endocarditis or hemolytic uremic syndrome) are rare [47\u201349]. Mortality in the developed world is also rare. In the United States, less than 1% of children with CAP severe enough to require hospitalization die, and this result is a nearly 100% reduction in pneumonia-associated mortality over the past 50 years [38, 50].",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses unquestionably play a major role in pediatric pneumonia, either alone or in combination with bacteria. Respiratory viruses are ubiquitous pathogens of the upper respiratory tract and cause pneumonia by progressive invasion of the respiratory epithelium, leading to diffuse inflammation that eventually overwhelms normal host defenses to infect the lower airways. Histologically, viral CAP is characterized by diffuse interstitial and parenchymal lymphocytic proliferation [51, 52]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza, adenovirus, and others have long been implicated as important pathogens [41, 53\u201358] (Table 1). Pathogens recently implicated as a cause of pneumonia include human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [59], human bocavirus (hBoV) [60], and novel rhinovirus and coronavirus species [61]. Studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection methods have documented viruses in 60%\u201380% of children with CAP [62\u201367], confirming the importance of RSV as the major cause of viral pneumonia (19%\u201342% of pneumonia cases) and also highlighting the role of rhinovirus (14%\u201326%), hBoV (2%\u201318%), hMPV (2%\u201312%), PIV (2%\u201311%), influenza (3%\u201310%), and adenovirus (2%\u201318%). Viral pathogens represent the most common cause of CAP in children less than 5 years of age, and especially those less than 2 years of age. Tsolia et al [68] also documented a high prevalence of viral pneumonia among older children who were hospitalized with CAP, although in contrast to young children, RSV was rarely detected (3%), whereas rhinovirus accounted for nearly half of the viruses detected.",

These studies indicate that RSV is the only viral pathogen that is consistently associated with disease. Results for other pathogens are variable. Rhinovirus and hBoV are often implicated in infections with 2 or more pathogens [62, 63], both are frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infections, and both exhibit prolonged shedding after acute infection [71, 72]. Nonetheless, rhinovirus has been recovered from the lower airways of experimentally infected adult volunteers [73\u201375], and serologic evidence of acute infection with hBoV has been reported in children with CAP [76, 77]. Thus, although it appears that these pathogens contribute to lower respiratory tract infections, their exact roles remain unknown.",

Pneumococci are frequent colonizers of the upper respiratory tract, and they invade the lung by aspiration or inhalation, often during periods of impaired pulmonary host defenses such as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Proliferation in the lower airways results in alveolar inflammation, which is characterized by neutrophil activation and exudative fluid accumulation that spreads rapidly to adjacent alveoli and typically results in lobar pneumonia [52, 78, 79]. PCV7 has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and all-cause pneumonia among children. By 2007, rates of laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia among US children less than 5 years of age had declined by 50% (from 16.3 to 8 per 100 000) compared with preconjugate vaccine years 1998\u201399 [80]. Postlicensure observational studies demonstrate similar reductions of 20%\u201352% for all-cause pneumonia hospitalization rates in the United States and England; admission rates for pneumococcal pneumonia have declined by 57%\u201373% [33, 38, 81].",

Recent data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program demonstrated that over 80% of IPD cases prelicensure were caused by PCV7 serotypes. By 2007, only 2% of cases were caused by PCV7 serotypes. Of the nonvaccine serotypes, 19A was responsible for nearly one-half of laboratory-confirmed IPD cases reported to ABCs in 2007 compared with 3% prelicensure [80]. Serotype 19A is also associated with the rapid emergence of penicillin- and multidrug-resist strains and is implicated frequently in severe disease [86\u201391]. Nevertheless, the increase in nonvaccine serotypes is modest compared with the reduction in PCV7 serotypes, such that actual disease incidence remains significantly reduced. Serotype 19A along with several other important serotypes are also included in the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) licensed in 2010 in the United States and should lead to further declines in the incidence of IPD [92]. The proportion of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates will likely continue to decline because nearly all nonsusceptible isolates in 2008 were caused by the additional serotypes contained in the PCV13 [93].",

Between 2002 and 2007, discharges for MRSA pneumonia more than doubled at US children's hospitals [94]. True to the typical phenotype of invasive staphylococcal infections, MRSA pneumonia is often severe with high rates of both local and systemic complications [95]. The increase in CA-MRSA also parallels the rapid increase in parapneumonic empyema [42, 96\u201398], and it is often the most commonly isolated pathogen in MRSA-prevalent regions [99]. As a result, empiric therapy for severe or complicated pneumonia almost always requires consideration of S aureus, including MRSA in prevalent regions. Despite the increased incidence of staphylococcal disease, molecular diagnostics suggest that pneumococcus remains an important cause of complicated pneumonia, especially in cases of culture-negative empyema [100].",

However, several studies have reported high rates of atypical bacterial infections among preschool age children with rates similar to that of older children [41, 102, 103]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections occur sporadically throughout the year, although epidemic outbreaks occur regularly every few years, and it is during these epidemics when young children may be disproportionately affected [103]. Thus, although atypical pathogens are more frequently encountered among school age children, they remain important considerations among younger children. Distinguishing between atypical pathogens and other bacterial causes is also difficult (Figure 3). Although the classic presentation of CAP caused by atypical pathogens is distinct from that of other bacterial pathogens, atypical disease may present very similarly to classic bacterial pneumonia, and M pneumoniae infection is occasionally severe with complications including parapneumonic effusion, lung abscess, and neurologic sequelae [102, 104\u2013107].",

Epidemiologic studies using sensitive molecular diagnostics also reveal a high prevalence of coinfections (20%\u201335%) [41, 53, 57, 58, 62, 63, 65, 68]. In vitro and animal studies suggest that the virulence of both bacterial and viral pathogens is enhanced in coinfections, exerting a synergistic effect on the host organism [110]. Several clinical studies document worse outcomes among children with coinfections compared with those without identified viral coinfection [109, 111\u2013114].

Pleural fluid cultures are more commonly positive (10%\u201325% of cases) despite nearly always being collected after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, presumably due to higher concentrations of organisms as well as prolonged time to sterilization compared with blood [45, 115, 121\u2013123]. Culture and microbiologic examination of sputum is rarely performed in children due to the inability of young children to expectorate and concerns for poor specimen quality. However, among older children, obtaining high-quality sputum could aid in the recovery of bacterial pathogens. Induction of sputum production with hypertonic saline may facilitate obtaining sputa from young children, but whether this method produces useful proportions of high-quality samples remains to be determined [67, 124]. Culture of material obtained directly from the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, transthoracic aspiration), although likely sensitive and less subject to upper airway contamination, is impractical in most cases.",

Testing for bacterial pathogens from these samples is problematic because distinguishing causative agent from colonizer is often impossible. Quantitative real-time PCR may prove to be useful in this regard, as recently demonstrated for S pneumoniae [130]. Pathogen load may also predict illness severity [131, 132].

Recovery of S pneumoniae doubled from 35% to 71% using PCR, confirming the importance of this pathogen in severe pneumonia. Serotype 19A, responsible for 23% of S pneumoniae isolates recovered by culture, represented only 2% of culture-negative isolates recovered by PCR. Likewise, only 2% of culture-negative empyema cases were attributed to S aureus, whereas this pathogen was responsible for 18% of culture-positive cases.

Although our appreciation for viral CAP has grown, it remains difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral etiologies, and even when bacterial disease seems obvious, insensitive diagnostics make precise pathogen detection challenging. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of the disease leads to a wide spectrum of illness severity, rendering outcome prediction difficult. The net effect is clinical decision-making that often lacks evidence, leading to wide variation in disease management, resource utilization, and outcomes [165]. In the United States, national guidelines for the management of CAP in children were published jointly by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [166]. The guidelines are comprehensive in scope and are an excellent resource for both clinicians and investigators, which hopefully will assist in standardizing management strategies. However, the presence of evidence-based national guidelines will not lead to improved care and outcomes unless widespread local adoption and implementation efforts are used [167, 168].",

Controversy over these points can be expected because this approach represents a major departure from typical practice in the United States Nonetheless, these recommendations are well supported by evidence, including recognition of the importance of viral CAP among young children; the dramatic reductions in IPD incidence and concomitant declines in penicillin resistance after introduction of PCV7\u2014a trend likely to continue with PCV13; and the proven effectiveness of appropriately dosed narrow spectrum therapy against nonmeningitic pneumococcal infections in the absence of high-level penicillin resistance.\n",

            "text": "In contrast, several of the guidelines' recommendations were supported by poor-quality evidence. The guideline committee highlighted this challenge by identifying areas for future research. Blood cultures are recommended for all children hospitalized with CAP even though the sensitivity of this test is poor; most children with suspected bacterial pneumonia have negative blood cultures. However, very little data are available to guide clinicians in selecting populations in whom blood cultures may be most useful. Macrolide therapy is recommended for CAP caused by atypical pathogens, although without microbiologic confirmation, distinguishing atypical from viral and typical bacterial pathogens remains challenging. Evidence demonstrating substantial effectiveness of macrolides for primary treatment of atypical CAP is also lacking. Recommendations for severe CAP are also less clear, including the use of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies for very severe CAP [169] and optimal management approaches for CAP complicated by pleural effusion or empyema. Simply defining CAP disease severity using objective criteria would be useful. A number of clinical severity scores are available for adult CAP (eg, CURB-65 [170] Pneumonia Severity Index [171]), which predict outcomes. These scores are used for risk stratification in research studies, and help to inform site of care decisions and tailor antimicrobial therapies in clinical care [172, 173]. The majority of these adult severity scores are designed to predict disease mortality and include predictive factors that are not relevant to children, thus limiting their utility in pediatric populations. Unfortunately, no pediatric CAP severity scores have been validated in the developed world, which is a major impediment to advancing our understanding of disease severity and improving outcomes for pediatric CAP.",
