Although sharing among families and friends has been a traditional form of exchange throughout human history (Belk, 2010), new forms of sharing between strangers enabled by digital technologies are emerging (Frenken and Schor, 2017). The sharing economy phenomenon has been growing for over a decade (Acquier et al., 2017; Frenken and Schor, 2017; Zvolska et al., 2019). Particularly spurred by the rapid digitalisation and penetration of smart phones, sharing economy platforms have been transforming production and consumption systems in cities around the world (May et al., 2017; McLaren and Agyeman, 2015; Zvolska et al., 2018). The sharing economy is forecast to grow by more than 25% annually (PwC, 2014).",

Proponents of the sharing economy claim that it can help mitigate new realities of continuing economic recession, governmental austerity, increasing disparities between \u2018haves and have-nots\u2019, and growing environmental problems caused by consumption (Agyeman et al., 2013; Botsman and Rogers, 2011; Gansky, 2012).

Critical voices warn that there is little evidence to support sustainability claims of sharing (Cohen, 2016; Schor, 2014). The sharing economy is seen as a threat to professionalism, public safety, privacy and health, and labour rights (SOU, 2017; Vith et al., 2019), as well as a risk of promoting increased consumption and associated environmental burden (Martin, 2016; Voytenko Palgan et al., 2017). In particular, the rapid penetration of services delivered by multi-national platform giants such as Airbnb and Uber has been taking governments by surprise, leaving them unprepared for the challenges that might arise (Davidson and Infranca, 2016; Ferreri and Sanyal, 2018; Finck and Ranchord\u00e1s, 2016; Gy\u00f3di, 2019; Voytenko Palgan et al., 2017).

Many of the challenges of understanding the sharing economy are linked to the fragmented research on the topic, using either secondary or primary data, so a mixed-method approach exploring structural and functional units of the sharing economy is needed (Gur\u0103u and Ranchhod, 2020).

Martin et al., 2010; Owyang et al., 2014), as well as the inclusionary and exclusionary effects by and on users (Schor et al., 2016). Several studies have also highlighted the shifting role of the citizen-consumers in the sharing economy \u2013 from the more passive consumer, i.e. citizen buying a product or service from a company (business-to-consumer or B2C), to a dual role as both provider and receiver in a peer-to-peer (P2P) relationship (Eden, 2015; Jaeger-Erben et al., 2015). Hence, the term \u2018user\u2019 is often applied in the sharing economy discourse in order to denote the dual peer relation. While there are several studies on the motivations and perceptions of active users of the sharing economy, less is known about the wider public perceptions of the sharing economy (Cherry and Pidgeon, 2018) and of the perspectives of non-users, e.g. why the current sharing economy may not be available or appealing to them. As pointed out by Retamal (2019) in this volume, existing research on sharing economy practices has focused on high-income countries, while considerably less attention has been given to sharing economy practices in low-income parts of the world.",

            "text": "Although research on business models has exploded in recent years, understanding how value is created, delivered and captured in business models in the sharing economy remains in a nascent stage (Andreassen et al., 2018). Research is emerging on business model innovation at organisational level (Bocken et al., 2013) and on innovating sustainable business models (Breuer et al., 2018; Geissdoerfer et al., 2016; Joyce and Paquin, 2016; Yang et al., 2017), but consensus is limited on definition of sharing business models, their fundamental characteristics, and the nature of markets they create. We also know very little about why sharing organisations diversify their business models, what mechanisms for diversification are, and how and why they create business model portfolios. Assessment of viability and sustainability of different sharing economy business models is lacking. Tools and methods for business modelling are still scarce, and those that exist rarely elevate sustainability as a driver or an explicit goal when business models in the sharing economy are being developed (Geissdoerfer et al., 2018). Examples of successful sustainable business model implementation are also rare (Ritala et al., 2018), and there is the \u2018design-implementation gap\u2019 (Baldassarre et al., 2020; Geissdoerfer et al., 2018). Knowledge is also scarce on the mechanisms for mainstreaming and upscaling different business models, and sharing business models in particular (Meijer et al., 2019). The understanding is emerging that professionalisation and commercialisation of originally communal forms of sharing might have implications for their sustainability ambitions, but empirical evidence is lacking (Cockayne, 2016). The interplay between business model innovations and socio-technical and organisational contexts overall has not been sufficiently explored (Grinevich and Huber, 2015). Indeed, sharing organisations do not evolve in isolation. They affect the established sectors and companies, which are responding by either joining the sharing economy organisational field to reap economic benefits or tackling the disrupting newcomers (Winterhalter et al., 2015). How the changes in business models of incumbents affect the sharing economy is largely unknown (Ciulli and Kolk, 2019).",

Sharing in cities is promising because of high density and high levels of income of urban population, which leads to high levels of consumption and results in high volumes of underutilised assets. The rapid digitalisation also increases connectivity between sharing platform users. There is a need to understand the role of policy and regulation in enabling or constraining the sharing economy, as well as the kind of governance arrangements needed to ensure socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the sharing economy in cities. While municipalities engage with sharing economy organisations differently (Voytenko Palgan et al., 2019; Zvolska et al., 2018) and govern the phenomenon in proactive or reactive ways (Bernardi and Diamantini, 2018; Davidson and Infranca, 2016; Finck and Ranchord\u00e1s, 2016), municipal institutional responses to the sharing economy remain underdeveloped (Ma et al., 2018). At the same time, urban governance of the sharing economy is becoming increasingly important since, if managed well, the sharing economy may have a transformative impact on cities and their economic prosperity, social viability and environmental quality (WEF, 2017). Therefore, it is important to understand how to govern the sharing economy in cities so that municipalities and their residents could capitalise on the benefits offered by the sharing economy and circumvent its pitfalls.",

During the workshop sessions, conceptual, methodological and empirical questions on the operations, governance aspects, actors and impacts of the sharing economy in different geographical contexts were explored. The workshop was testimony to a growing interest in seeking to understand the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the sharing economy that engages various actors, including sharing economy platforms, their users, incumbent businesses, and municipal governments.",

They bring insights from different countries, including Austria, Brazil, China, Germany, France, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. The volume therefore makes an important contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies to supplement the more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. Furthermore, the articles draw on different conceptual and theoretical backgrounds, stemming from a range of academic disciplines, e.g. Business and Management, Geography, Economics, Environmental Sciences, Sociology, Political Science, Psychology, Science and Technology Studies, and Urban Studies.",

The next seven articles focus on consumer, resident and citizen perspectives, including their perceptions, motivations (Cerutti et al., 2019; Hartl et al., 2018; Hawlitschek et al., 2018; Schanes and Stagl, 2019) and acceptance of sharing services (Cherry and Pidgeon, 2018), and the role of sustainability for consumers of the sharing economy (Cherry and Pidgeon, 2018; Hartl et al., 2018; Laamanen et al., 2018; Retamal, 2019). This is followed by seven articles discussing business perspectives on the sharing economy, including sharing economy platforms (Curtis and Mont, 2020; Fraanje and Spaargaren, 2019; Geissinger et al., 2019; Guyader and Piscicelli, 2019; Netter et al., 2019; van Waes et al., 2018) and incumbents (Ciulli and Kolk, 2019). The final three articles discuss the relevance of the sharing economy in cities, its impacts and challenges (Bernardi and Diamantini, 2018; Gy\u00f3di, 2019; Ma et al., 2018), and the ways in which the sharing economy may be governed in urban contexts (Bernardi and Diamantini, 2018; Ma et al., 2018).

Special attention is paid to how previous literature has discussed whether the sharing economy is sustainable. Zooming in from the broader understanding of the sharing economy to its specific sectors, the paper by Yuana et al. (2019) studies ridesharing in Indonesia and the Philippines. The authors explore the framings of ridesharing found in local news articles to bring a perspective from the Global South. The three studies offer a deeper understanding of complex structure and dynamics of the sharing economy's and result in theoretical, methodological and practical implications.",

Using NVIVO, they analyse secondary sources and 256 interviews with sellers, service providers, clients or traditional competitors in France, Italy and the UK, bringing a rich dataset to this special volume. They deliver insights on who the main stakeholders are, how the sharing economy is understood and what the benefits and challenges are, as perceived in the literature and by the stakeholders. They find that the peer-to-peer dimension is much more emphasised in academic articles, books, and business reports compared to articles in newspapers and social media blogs. Books and service providers mainly focus on the benefits of the sharing economy, while competitors highlight the challenges.

They elaborate on whether the frames constitute a problem, a solution, or a rationale. Then the authors link the identified frames to policy responses to ridesharing.

However, for those choosing B2C services, the financial benefits and convenience are considered more important. Here, environmental impacts are considered more as a positive side effect. These results indicate the importance of distinguishing between P2P and B2C services in marketing, communication strategies, and public policy. As pointed out by Hawlitscheck et al.

The study shows that the overall perceptions of the sharing economy in the UK context are positive, specifically in terms of the potentials to reduce environmental footprints, strengthen community, and enable access to previously unaffordable products and services. However, the results also indicate more deep-seated concerns about the (lack of) safety and hygiene of shared products and peer-delivered services, fear of social inequality, and general low levels of trust in companies used for sharing operations.

The case studies include not only active users of collaborative consumption services but also policy makers, business owners, consultants, and NGOs, in order to explore prospects for mainstreaming. Retamal (2019) concludes that there are several factors that indicate possibilities for mainstreaming of collaborative consumption, e.g. high density of people, limited housing sizes, traffic congestion, and long commuting times. However, the study also shows that there is resistance, particularly to shared-access practices such as shared laundry machines or car sharing. The resistance stems from lack of trust, lack of knowledge of how to use the shared equipment, and lack of institutional support for consumer-to-consumer business models.",

It is applied to the bike sharing sector where mechanisms of upscaling of four business models \u2013 two-way station-based, one-way station-based, one-way free floating, and peer-to-peer sharing \u2013 are discussed and tested. The findings show that more traditional station-based business models have already been institutionalised, but experience difficulties with scaling up. On the other hand, the novel one-way free-floating models have the highest scaling potential. By combining the business model perspective with transition analysis, the framework can be used to predict the upscaling potential of different SEBMs. The paper contributes to transition and institutionalisation literature.",

The findings demonstrate that sustainability connotations are diverse, but specific for various sharing sectors, such as fashion, on-demand services, and logistics (Geissinger et al., 2019). At the same time, the research found no evidence of the sharing economy unicorns describing themselves as being sustainable.

The authors develop a tool aimed at this. The tool is based on performing a morphological analysis of SEBMs, according to which business model attributes and their alternate conditions are systematically mapped. Curtis and Mont (2020) propose four conditions for improved sustainability performance: SEBMs operating as platforms, leveraging idling capacity of an existing stock of goods, applying non-pecuniary motivation for ownership, and facilitating temporary access over ownership. The sharing economy business modelling tool has been developed and tested with experts, and should be of interest to all actors concerned about sustainability impacts of sharing organisations.",

The authors set out to investigate present and future trajectories of sharing practices on the Peerby and MyWheels platforms, by employing a practice theoretical perspective of social change addressed in the sociological theories (Schatzki, 2016). The article demonstrates that participants in the sharing economy engage with sharing practices in both pragmatic and emotional ways. The findings also show the important role of emotions and human agency in influencing the dynamic interactions between companies, practices, and practitioners that shape the future of the sharing economy. Analysing the practices of two platforms, tool and car sharing (Peerby and MyWheels respectively), two distinct trajectories are identified. While Peerby from the outset is based on the idea of sharing goods by connecting people, its introduction of Peerby Go seeks to increase efficiency of sharing at the expense of reduced social interaction. In contrast, MyWheels, whose initial aim was to optimise car sharing efficiency, is currently trying to increase the sense of community on the platform. The authors suggest that, in order to understand trajectories of sharing practices, we need to consider how sharing organisations organise their practices, the types of products that are shared, and how people embed sharing practices in their daily lives (Fraanje and Spaargaren, 2019). This practice-theoretical perspective on the future of the sharing economy resonates with the call to study sharing practices of resource owners, resource users, and platforms in the article by Curtis and Mont (2020).",

They find that, while specific municipal governance approaches differ, both municipalities work along all three dimensions to create a sharing city. The cities of Seoul and Milan view human dimension and social capital as important, so avoid building on purely neoliberal logic of developing prosperous and competitive urban areas or on a more technocratic orientation of smart cities. The authors argue that it is important to recognise the role if new actors in urban governance and promote their cooperation, as well as for municipalities to act as enabling states of the sharing paradigm.

At the same time, the study identifies governance approaches of city councils to be the reason for the variation (Gy\u00f3di, 2019). Another finding from the spatial analysis is that \u201cwhile Airbnb was highly concentrated in areas dense with traditional hotels, it complemented the hotel industry in more suburban areas\u201d (Gy\u00f3di, 2019, p. 546).

They also brought new insights into the narratives and policies of the sharing economy in the Global South by analysing ridesharing in the Philippines and Indonesia. They contributed methodologically by using both secondary and primary sources to define the main characteristics of the sharing economy, its stakeholders, and the perceived systemic benefits and challenges. Finally, the papers debated the importance of sustainability in the literature and in practice, which is likely to play a major role in future publications.",

Studies in this volume discuss many positive and negative sides of the sharing economy and how perceptions, actions and connotations about the sharing economy are changing with time. There is an emerging trend that some organisations shed their sustainability aspirations as they grow to fit the mainstream institutional contexts. Therefore, some studies call for a more strategic and deliberate stance on how sharing economy business models are shaped and evolve. Some studies suggest that it is important to understand the roles and interplay between actors, institutions and infrastructures that shape the evolution, sustainability and upscaling of business models in the sharing economy. Several papers conclude that understanding sharing practices of different actors, such as resource owners and resource users, is also critical, because they affect the sustainability of sharing organisations and trajectories of their development.",

While the articles revealed both reactive and proactive engagement with the sharing economy among municipal governments, one important conclusion is that more agile action by municipalities will be important to leverage the sustainability potential of the sharing economy. In particular, collaboration was argued to be useful when governing the complexity of sharing economy developments, but to make it work, more focus should be paid to a better integration of emerging social actors in the governance processes and building on the social capital of urban residents.",

This also means handing over certain forms of power, control of resources, skills and know-how to companies. Research on the sharing economy has almost exclusively focused on urban contexts in \u2018advanced economies\u2019, while sharing practices in rural, small town and \u2018less advanced\u2019 contexts have received far less attention.

Further research is needed on business model innovation in socio-technical contexts, studying actors, institutions and infrastructures in their interplay. Another important direction is to explore the role of incumbents in shaping the sharing economy by affecting actors, institutions and infrastructures. In order to utilise the sustainability potential of the sharing economy, tools and methods for evaluating sustainability performance of business models need to be developed. More importantly, it is critical to improve the granularity of assessment, which would allow us to understand how change in design of certain business model elements affects the overall sustainability of the sharing economy business model. Future research should also focus on improving understanding of how sharing organisations evolve, and why and when their sustainability aspirations change, including cross-case and cross-sectoral comparisons. Finally, research on sharing economy business models needs to be supplemented with studies about behaviour of sharing economy participants, i.e. individuals who are involved in the sharing economy either as resource owners and resource users, and their everyday practices, since they affect both the sustainability of sharing economy business models and trajectories of their upscaling and mainstreaming.",
