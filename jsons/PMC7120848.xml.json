Preventive, health education and promotion, social support systems, and some of the designed social technologies listed in Table 5.1, such as assisted living facilities, senior centers, continuing care retirement communities, and child care centers, which are primarily concerned with health maintenance, are secondary under the medical model. As we noted in 10.1007/978-1-4614-3169-5_4, some of these technologies were not part of the regular medical system until the quest for cost containment led to their invention and incorporation into the health care delivery system.",

In this definition, emphasis is put on the fact that health is not merely the absence of disease, but also involves a social dimension. Therefore, it also emphasizes the social and financial support systems identified in Table 5.1 of 10.1007/978-1-4614-3169-5_5. This definition of health, as involving the combination of physical, mental, and social well-being led to the concept of the \u201cHealth Triangle.\u201d",

For example, the BRCA1 gene accounts for only between 5 and 10% of breast cancers in the United States; only about 10% of colon cancers may be explained by genes, and only about 5% of elevated serum cholesterol levels may be explained by familial hyperlipidemia. Similarly, studies of identical twins focusing on the occurrence of schizophrenia, and other twin studies examining the occurrence of dementia in older people, have found that about half of each might be explained by genetic factors. Further, while about two-thirds of the risk of obesity might be genetic, the risk is expressed only with exposure to controllable lifestyle factors (Baird 1994, p. 133; Muller 2000, p. 7; Panjukanta et al. 1998, p. 369; Kendler 1983, p. 1413; Rowe and Kahn 1998).",

Those with good educational achievements are more likely to attain higher socioeconomic status than the poorly educated (Angel et al. 2006; Barr 2008; Bartley 1994; Mirowsky and Ross 1986, p. 23). People of lower socioeconomic status die earlier and are more susceptible to undesirable life events than people on higher socioeconomic levels, a pattern that holds true in a progressive fashion from the poorest to the richest (McLeod and Kessler 1990, p. 162; Adler et al. 1993, p. 3140; Adler and Newman 2002, p. 60; Guralnik et al. 1993, p. 110; McDonough et al. 1997, p. 1476). This trend also holds whether one looks at education or occupation (National Center for Health Statistics 1998, p. 3; Kaplan and Keil 1993, p. 1973). These differences are said to be due to the fact that people of higher socioeconomic status have healthier behaviors and lifestyles than those of lower socioeconomic status. People of higher socioeconomic status are less likely to smoke, and are far more likely to eat healthier foods and to engage in leisure-time physical exercise (National Center for Health Statistics 2002, p. 198; Pratt et al. 1999, p. S526; Giles-Corti and Donovan 2002, p. 601). According to Isaacs and Schroeder (2004, p. 1138), as a result of \u201ca sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits, obesity and the diseases it fosters now characterize lower-class life.\u201d",

Rather, another explanation for the differentials lies in the distribution of income or the income gradient between the low and high socioeconomic groups. In a study of white Americans using 1980 census data, undertaken by Smith et al. (1996, p. 486), men earning less than $10,000 per year were 1.5 times as likely to die prematurely as were those earning $34,000 or more. A similar study of British civil servants conducted about 2 years before the American study showed that when smoking and other risk factors were controlled for, those who were in the lowest employment category were more than twice as likely to die prematurely of cardiovascular disease as were those in the highest employment category (Davey Smith et al. 1994, p. 131). The findings of these studies have led to the theory that inequitable distribution of income and wealth, or the so-called income and wealth gradient, causes poor health (Sen 1992, p. 102, 1999, p. 87; Daniels et al. 2000; Deaton 2002, p. 13).",

Specifically, the survey results showed that 14.1% of those surveyed had rarely or never worn a seatbelt during the 30 days preceding the survey; 30.7% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol; 17.4% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey; 47.1% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey; 23.9% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey; and 8.8% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey (Grunbaum et al. 2002, p. 313).",

In other words, while individual and population health are somehow associated with having access to curative care, access to preventive services is of greater significance. Therefore, health can improve significantly, and the prevalence of disease can decline dramatically, without effective medical care, due to the other determinants of health (Sigerist 1970, p. 46; McKeown 1976, p. 93; Banta and Jonas 1995, p. 19). This knowledge is very likely the reason why Williams and Jackson (2005, p. 325) and Isaacs and Schroeder (2004, p. 1141) advocate the broadening of the concept of health policy to include the other determinants of health that were not usually seriously considered when discussing health policy.

That period was reported to be the warmest January\u2013November in the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis, which covers 131 years. The period was only a few hundredths of a degree warmer than 2005, so it is possible that the final GISS results for the full year, 2010, would be warmer or in the same range as 2005. Further, the available data also show that the Earth\u2019s surface has warmed by more than 0.8\u00b0C over the past century and by about 0.6\u00b0C in the past 3 decades (NASA 2010). Therefore, contrary to frequent assertions that global warming has slowed in the past decade, global warming has proceeded in the decade that ended in 2010 just as fast as it did in the prior 2 decades (NASA 2010).",

They include increased risks of extreme weather, such as floods and storms, fatal heat waves, long-term drought conditions in many areas of the world, surface water pollution and groundwater contamination, the melting of glaciers that supply freshwater to large population centers, salination of sources of agricultural and drinking water, increased rates of water extraction that may precipitate declines in supply, and creating a conducive environment for the global killers that are very sensitive to climatic conditions, such as malaria, diarrhea, and protein-energy malnutrition (Campbell-Lendrum et al. 2007, p. 235; Friis 2007, p. 3).

First, there is likely to be increased demand for services due to population growth, whether that growth is due to increased fertility rates or migration. For example, the exponential growth in Medicaid expenditures in states that border Mexico are said to be due to the increased demand for medical services by illegal immigrants as well as by the medical needs of an aging population. Second, officials of the states that share boundaries with Mexico complain about increased violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, crimes that take a heavy toll on population health and health care expenditures. Third, increased migration compels more health services planning, infrastructure maintenance, development and training of a diverse medical workforce to cater for the increasingly diverse population, and the establishment of public health programs for health promotion, health protection, and disease prevention (MacPherson et al. 2007, p. 200; Cohen et al. 2002, p. 90). And, fourth, the opinion pages of newspapers carry citizens\u2019 letters that attribute the success of previous terrorist campaigns to the nearly open border policy the United States maintained prior to September 11, 2001 (9/11). Since the 9/11 attacks, border security and entry visa requirements have been tightened. Border control measures are now centered on inspecting and excluding goods, vessels, and people that pose serious health or terrorist threats to the United States. Other countries have similar measures.",

These include preventive medicine, genetic disposition, social and economic circumstances, environmental conditions, lifestyles and behaviors, and medical care. These determinants of health are associated, in various degrees, with the real or actual causes of death in the country. Research demonstrates that most of the deaths in the country are attributable to a small number of largely controllable behaviors and exposures, or due to factors that fall under the preventive, social, economic, environmental, and lifestyle and behavioral determinants of health. These determinants of health are not only affected by the broad national and personal factors identified in the chapter, they are also affected by global or international factors, including trade and finance, outbreaks of infectious diseases, climate change, natural disasters, and the threats of terrorism and population mobility.",
