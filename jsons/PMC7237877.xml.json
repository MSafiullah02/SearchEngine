            "text": "Acute phase proteins (APP) are sensitive markers that change their concentration as a reaction to a systemic inflammatory process [1] and are known to increase in response to infectious diseases [2\u20134], immune mediated diseases [5\u20137], neoplasia [8\u201310] and surgery [11]. APPs react more rapidly and with a shorter half-life period than classic markers of inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important major APP in dogs, which increases within the first 8-24 h after an inflammatory stimulus [12, 13] and reaches up to 100-fold of the baseline levels [1]. This wide range permits a more detailed evaluation of an inflammatory process than leukocyte counts. CRP measurement is meanwhile widely available in veterinary medicine. According to state-of-the-art scientific research, the CRP range of healthy dogs is below ~ 10\u201320 mg/l CRP [12, 14, 15]. Canine CRP value increases of up to > 900 mg/l are reported in extremely rare cases [13, 16]. Different cut-off values have been discussed as medical decision limits for human and canine CRP [17]. While there is no general definition, which medical decision limits should be utilized to classify an inflammation as low grade or moderate, there is a consent that CRP values above 100 mg/l indicate a high grade inflammation [18\u201320]. While current research provides at least some information on extreme leukocytosis in small animals [21, 22], studies addressing extremely high CRP values in dogs are rare [3]. Scarce knowledge is available about the prevalence of CRP values above 100 mg/l in dogs. In humans, prevalence of CRP values > 100 m/l is ranging between 3 and 30% depending on the patient population [18, 23].",

Although acute-phase-proteins are relatively unspecific markers of different types of inflammation in human as well as in veterinary medicine [25], extremely high CRP concentrations > 100 mg/L in association with specific symptom complexes (e.g. signs of pneumonia or signs of meningitis) are indicative of bacterial inflammation [20, 26, 27] and thus a decision criterion for antibiotic treatment in human medicine. In dogs, the use of decision limits for CRP concentrations to recognize potential bacterial etiology have been rarely investigated. To the authors\u2019 knowledge there is only one study in dogs with respiratory diseases that recommended a similar decision limit for detection of septic pneumonia as in humans [3]. However, the decision limit might not be the same for other organ systems. Moreover, dogs with neoplastic diseases had been ruled out in the previous study so that it can only be used in a very limited, rather artificial, setting.",

While bacterial infections have been reported in 55% (462/839) [18] to 78% (35/42) [20] of human patients with CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l, only 22% (33/149) of canine patients in our study fell into this category. In contrast to human beings, high CRP values above 100 mg/l were not able to discriminate between different disease etiologies in dogs in our data set. Our data confirm the theory that CRP cannot be used as a differentiation parameter to distinguish between infectious or even bacterial and non-infectious /non-bacterial diseases in dogs. Therefore, high CRP values are no indication for antibiotic treatment. Extremely high CRP values indicate a severe inflammation with acute phase reaction with various etiologies. The proportion of non-infectious diseases seen here (12%) is comparable to a recent study in humans (rheumatologic diseases ~ 8%) [18]. In contrast, the proportion of neoplastic diseases (16%) is higher in our study compared to human medicine, where these patients only account for ~ 5% [18]. A descriptive study on dogs with various diseases included a high proportion of patients with immune-mediated diseases or cancer among dogs with > 100 mg/l CRP which is in accordance with our results [19].",

This could also be adopted to veterinary medicine, keeping in mind that especially non-infectious inflammations and neoplasia are also common etiologies. The fact that the diagnosis \u201cbacterial infection\u201d in our study was not always based on a positive microbiological finding might be seen as a limitation of the study. To our own experience and also according to recent research, microbiological analysis is helpful and important but not infallible. Negative results occur in patients with definite bacterial disease [29]. In human medicine, these are 25\u201360% of the samples [30]. It is acknowledged to start antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients based on the suspicion of a bacterial infection [31]. In cases of negative cultural results, it is up to the clinician\u2019s decision if antibiotics are necessary [31, 32]. On the other hand, positive microbiological results do not always prove an infection. There may be (pre) analytical problems such as contaminations or an overgrowth with bacteria that have not been the original pathogens. Furthermore, it is not always possible to take microbiological samples due to the anatomical region of inflammation or the critical state of the patient. Therefore, we took the conscious decision not only to include cases with (positive) bacteriological examination results in our study, but also to include cytological and histological findings as well as the clinical course of the patient. This is handled similarly in other studies [33].",

It is well known that traumatic events lead to tissue damage and induce an acute phase reaction within the first 24 h that subsides gradually until the point of time of suture removal [11, 38, 39]. The increase of CRP does not only depend on the degree of trauma [16, 39] but may also depend on the CRP value before surgery, the surgeon and analytical variations [29]. Another limitation of our study, however, might be the fact that bacterial infections could not always be excluded especially if surgery was performed in primarily \u201cnon-sterile\u201d organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. This may have led to misclassifications of the disease category.",

            "text": "Our findings in dogs demonstrated that extreme increases in CRP cannot be attributed to specific organ systems. Nevertheless, it was obvious that some organ systems tend to be more frequently involved in marked inflammations. On the one hand, these are organ systems which are frequently exposed to bacteria (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract [19, 28, 40]), but on the other hand these are also organ systems which are affected by non-infectious, often immune-mediated, diseases (e.g. the musculoskeletal system [41, 42]). CRP analyses of patients with diseases of the reproductive organs are likely underrepresented in our study as they are primarily referred to the clinic for obstetrics. Interestingly, an organ system with frequent contact to microorganisms (respiratory tract), which is known to present with high CRP values [3, 28] in the case of bacterial infection, was underrepresented in our study. A reason for that could be that patients with bacterial pneumonia, seen in our university clinic, partly present with complicated disease progresses (e.g. pyothorax secondary to septic foreign body in the lung) or suffer from multiple diseases (aspiration pneumonia secondary to another disease, pneumonia due to immunosuppression) and were therefore not always classified as solely \u201crespiratory patients\u201d. Given our results, the attempt to define a cut-off value to detect septic inflammation is only promising for organ systems rarely affected by immune mediated diseases and after ruling out malignant neoplasia with high probability as it has been done previously for the respiratory tract [3].",

The high hospitalization rate of 90% seen here, can be explained with the fact that the majority of dogs was clinically severely ill. Nevertheless, there was no association of CRP and hospitalization. Similar findings have been reported for dogs with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or pyometra [7, 52]. The lack of impact of hospitalization on a single CRP result > 100 mg/l demonstrates that the absolute CRP value alone is not a definite prognostic marker but rather indicates a severe disease. Five of the seven (71%) non-hospitalized dogs were cancer patients. In these patients, the decision against hospitalization was probably not made because of a mild disease but due to the unfavorable prognosis. All five dogs were euthanized within the next two weeks.",

Patients were evaluated in different states of disease. Several patients were already pretreated. This is a known problem of medical studies investigating naturally diseased patients, especially if conducted in referral hospitals. In our study, especially the pretreatment with anti-inflammatory or antibiotic agents is a limitation which might have lowered CRP concentrations. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that canine patients presented to our clinic still had an active disease process, even if pretreated. It has been shown that antibiotic pretreatment in dogs with > 24 h respiratory symptoms did not significantly affect the CRP concentration as well as pretreatment with glucocorticoids [3, 6]. Moreover, underlying conditions might have an impact on CRP concentrations. It is known that severe liver failure might lower the CRP value, but only little information is available in literature [53]. Statistical evaluation was hampered by the relatively small patient number in some subgroups so that significances might have been missed.",
