In fact, in the acute phases of the pathology, the respiratory physical therapists support the work of intensive care physicians, pulmonologists and nurses by: providing qualified care in the different modalities of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV); monitoring and addressing respiratory fatigue; preventing the complications of prolonged immobility; prone positioning to improve gas exchange in severily ill subjects; participating in the weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation protocols; and assisting in the recovery of the patient's autonomy in activities of daily life, which is often compromised by long periods of sedation and prolonged hospitalization. In a quick response to the increasing demand of patients in intensive care unit, the \"Associazione dei riabilitatori dell'Insufficienza Respiratoria\" (ArIR) had written an outstanding position paper that covers everything regarding physical therapy practice in intensive care units. 6 In Italy, at the beginning of the spread of the epidemic, there were approximately 5,200 beds in intensive care units. 7 The situation in the epicenter area has been described as terrifying with overcrowded hospitals and lack of medications, ventilators, oxygen, and personal protective equipment. 8 So, it is also very important to reduce the length of hospitalization and therefore to free up places more quickly and allow other patients to be accommodated, given the serious shortage of beds compared to the growth of the contagion.",
