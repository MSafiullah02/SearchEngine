As nutrients were provided by the in vivo environment, the implanted chondrocytes gradually started producing extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen and glycoproteins. While a cell-free ear-shaped polymer could not have maintained its original shape in vivo due to the hydrolytic degradation of the polymer, the chondrocytes seeded onto the polymer maintained the original scaffold shape for 12 weeks after implantation. Indeed, the geometry was similar to and as complex as the original human ear.",

However, as the number of devices and implants continues to increase, the frequency of device-related infections will also increase [32], [33]. Infections that are mostly caused by staphylococci, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, usually do not respond to antibiotic therapy, necessitating removal of the implanted device.",

            "text": "In vivo microbial contamination of these devices differs from infection of natural tissues. Medical devices lack an immune system or bloodstream. Thus, once microorganisms invade through skin scratches, wounds, airways, or medical interventions and attach to the surface of the implanted material, they begin to form a bacterial biofilm [34]. The biofilm is composed of glycoproteins and polysaccharides secreted by microorganisms. Unlike circulating bacteria, biofilm-protected microorganisms are resistant to physical removal, host immunity, and antibiotics. Furthermore, since most antibiotics are unable to completely diffuse inside the biofilm, long-term antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of antibiotic resistance. In the United States, for example, catheter-related infections are a major cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality. More than 300,000 U.S. patients are infected annually during presurgical or surgical procedures [35]. Moreover, as biofilms are slow to develop, infections due to biofilms may emerge several years after implantation. In artificial joint replacement surgery [36], this type of infection is a serious complication that can usually be cured only by removing the implant [32], [37]. Infection by microorganisms is also widespread among contact lens users. One common cause of vision loss is contact lens\u2013related microbial keratitis [38], [39], and the risk of microbial keratitis increases during extended wear. This is why clinicians recommend frequent removal or replacement of contact lenses [38]. Furthermore, infection is the most common reason for breast implant removal [40], [41]. These biofilm-related infections prolong hospitalization, increase medical costs, and sometimes result in mortality.",

[12], sheets are formed around a temporary 3D scaffold (like surgical tubing). Another standard approach is the layering of multiple cell sheets. Shimizu et al. layered beating cardiomyocyte sheets to fabricate scaffold-free 3D constructs and found that these layered cardiomyocytes exhibited synchronized beating. However, the maximum thickness was limited to less than 80 \u03bcm (three-cell layer), possibly due to starvation and hypoxia of inner layers that have poor access to the culture media and atmosphere. Moreover, cardiomyocytes are tightly interconnected by gap junctions, and the outer layer may prevent gas and nutrient exchange to the inner layers. Indeed, four-layered cardiomyocyte constructs showed necrosis in the inner layers [70]. To overcome this limited maximum thickness, they implanted 10 three-layered cardiomyocyte sheets into nude rat hearts at 1- or 2-day intervals, finally obtaining a 1-mm-thick neomyocardium fused onto the native heart and integrated with a well-organized microvascular network. Although it is obviously impossible to perform multiple thoracotomies on human patients, this demonstration revealed the importance of neovascularization for the gradual construction of larger cell constructs with or without the use of scaffolds [71], [72].",

            "text": "Certain cell types possess the capacity to synthesize and release components of ECM in vitro under appropriate culture conditions. Fibroblasts and chondrocytes, for example, produce collagens and proteoglycans in vitro. This ECM production capacity is accelerated under confluence or 3D culture conditions, a phenomenon that may be inspired to develop scaffold-free systems for fabrication of 3D constructs from isolated chondrocytes [73], [74]. Normal anchorage-dependent cells proliferate at low density in monolayer culture. When the cell density reaches a certain threshold, proliferation is suppressed by contact inhibition. Under contact inhibition, the cell cycle stops and chondrocytes start to produce ECM proteins. Using this in vitro\u2013produced ECM, many groups have developed methods to fabricate 3D scaffold-free constructs in vitro. Most of these approaches are used for fabrication of cartilage-like constructs [75], [76]. In this technique, a large number of isolated chondrocytes is loaded into a specific culture mold and fed reagents that enhance matrix production. Since chondrocytes exist under relatively low oxygen partial pressure and without blood supply in vivo (in joints), they are relatively harder than normal cells and can be cultured under high-density static culture conditions. Although these approaches require relatively longer culture, the resulting constructs are similar to native cartilage in terms of histology and biomechanical properties [77], [78], [79]. However, these \u201cin vitro self-produced ECM-rich scaffold-free\u201d constructs have limitations as well. It is difficult to expand cultures in 3D without hypoxia or nutrient starvation of inner core cells. Thus, most of these scaffold-free cartilage-like constructs are thinner than normal human articular cartilage in adults.",

The rotating wall reactor (RWR) was developed by NASA to produce cartilage-like tissue in space [80]. This reactor has also been used on earth to fabricate various other cell constructs [81], [82], [83]. Okamura et al. loaded isolated hepatocytes into an RWR and obtained a \u201cliver-like\u201d construct with bile duct\u2013 and vessel-like structures formed within the tissue. Histological analysis showed that the bile duct structures secreted mucin and formed complex tubular branches in the peripheral region. Distal to these bile duct structures, they observed mature hepatocytes capable of producing albumin and storing glycogen [84]. To our knowledge, there are still no clinical reports using engineered tissue fabricated by this method.",

Instead of using hydrogel as the \u201cbio-paper,\u201d we used medical-grade stainless needles as temporal fixators to skewer MCSs until they fused with one another. This concept was inspired from surgical treatments for bone fracture in orthopedic surgery, called \u201cexternal fixation\u201d (Figure 1.3\n). For treatment of bone fracture, orthopedic surgeons reposition fractured bone pieces to their original positions with or without surgery. After repositioning, surgeons immobilize bone pieces by using casts or splints without surgery or by using metal plates, screws, or pins under surgical procedure. Inspired from fracture treatment, especially by the external fixation technique, we developed the needle-array system. We also developed a robotic system that skewers MCSs into needle-array according to a three-dimensional design template (Figure 1.4\n).",

The lesson from this case is that despite promising results in vitro and in preclinical models (that are usually only monitored for a few months or years), the safety of scaffolds and implants must be confirmed in humans over the long term. Scaffold-free systems are an alternative for tissue engineering and repair of damaged tissues that may circumvent at least some of these potential risks.",
