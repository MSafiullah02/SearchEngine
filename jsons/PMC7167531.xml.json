As we all know, scientific research is a process of trial and error, and so is scientific publication. Even though journals rely on peer experts in the field to ensure the robustness of the analyses and minimize oversights, the evolving nature of scientific research means that given time, many studies could be contradicted or proven to be flawed. This is of course not because authors intend to mislead, but it is possible that a minor raw data pre-processing step or pre-assumption could potentially affect the final conclusions. Therefore, it is important to have the raw data available and similarly the source code and the implementation of the analyses. A stable and reproducible tool is the foundation of reproducible results.",

They have been proven to be stable and resilient over time, through funding shifts and other potentially disruptive situations, and the data within them is always available to the public. These databases are regulated by an international advisory board and updated synchronously.",

For instance, according to the latest version of Regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the management of human genetic resources [4], China continues to encourage institutions, institutes, medical centers, and companies to engage in international collaboration of researches involving human genetic resources. However, to make sure the pertinent data can be shared in a regulation-compliant manner, authors are required to file the data sharing plan and have it recorded online by the relevant authorities first.",

There are many benefits to posting a research or method article on a preprint, including faster dissemination of results or useful methods to the community, and opportunities for feedback prior to peer review. Genome Biology fully supports and encourages preprint posting of papers for the main reason that it encourages openness of research and more scientific discussion. We encourage our authors to post to a preprint server such as bioRxiv (http://www.biorxiv.com) when we send a paper for review; however, we notice an increasing number of papers that are submitted directly from bioRxiv using B2J, or already posted on a preprint at the time of submission. As mentioned in a recent publication [5], Genome Biology is among the journals that publish a large number of papers that were previously posted on bioRxiv, and we would be happy to see this trend continue.",

With the recent dissemination of research related to COVID-19, we have seen that preprint results have been misinterpreted by the media [6].

Of course, for at least the foreseeable future, clinical, identifiable data needs to be deposited with caution, but we expect that progress will be made in this area in the years to come. We also realize that our current requirement to accept only INSDC-indexed repositories can result in inconvenience to some. We hope that we will be able to accept additional repositories in the near future.
