            "text": "Coronavirus entry processes require complex interactions between multiple host and viral factors to enter the cells and initiate viral RNA translation and replication (Belouzard et al., 2012). The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein, is a critical viral factor for coronavirus entry. The S protein contains two subunits: N-terminal S1 subunit which binds to cellular receptors and S2 subunit which is responsible for membrane fusion (Paul and Perlman, 2013). The S protein undergoes conformation changes exposing two major cleavage sites at the junction of S1 and S2 subunit (S1/S2) and just upstream of the fusion peptide (S2\u2032) before and during virus entry into host cells (Belouzard et al., 2012). Cleavage at the S2\u2032 site by proteases exposes the fusion peptide, which is mainly composed of hydrophobic amino acids (Belouzard et al., 2012). The fusion peptide is then introduced into the host cell membrane by conformational change of S2 subunit mediated by refolding of heptad repeat 1 (Belouzard et al., 2012). As the fusion protein folds back, viral and cellular membranes are drawn together to initiate the membrane fusion for virus entry (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The proteases involved in the proteolytic cleavage of S protein have been studied for several coronaviruses. It was shown that furin processes the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) targeting the junction of S1/S2 (Sturman et al., 1985; Yamada and Liu, 2009). Since furin is mainly expressed in the trans-golgi network and the newly produced viruses possess cleaved S protein, the S proteins of those coronaviruses are thought to be processed during the stage of viral assembly (Seidah and Prat, 2012; Sturman et al., 1985; Yamada and Liu, 2009). The S proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and HCoV-229E are reported to be activated by a membrane-bound protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is widely distributed in the respiratory tracts (Bertram et al., 2011; Bugge et al., 2009; Shirato et al., 2013). Other cellular proteases such as cathepsins, which exist in the endosomes and lysosomes, have been reported to process coronavirus S protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and feline coronavirus (FCoV) and MHV-2 (Kawase et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2006; Regan et al., 2008; Simmons et al., 2005; Wicht et al., 2014). While the replication of most coronaviruses does not require exogenous proteases in cell culture media, proteases in the medium have been reported to enhance the replication of some coronaviruses including SARS-CoV (Matsuyama et al., 2005). For instance, trypsin, dispase, thermolysin and elastase have been reported to activate the S protein of SARS-CoV and enhance viral replication in cells (Matsuyama et al., 2005). The mutations in S protein are reported to alter protease susceptibility, pathogenicity and host range (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). Therefore, the proteolytic activation of S protein and viral entry are potential targets for antiviral drug development (Du et al., 2017; Simmons et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the genus of Alphacoronavirus in the Coronaviridae family, causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a disease responsible for severe economic losses in the swine industry worldwide (Jung and Saif, 2015). PEDV infects the villous epithelium of the small intestines and causes diarrhea and vomiting in the affected pigs with up to 100% mortality in neonatal piglets (Jung and Saif, 2015). Unlike most coronaviruses, field isolation and efficient replication of most PEDV strains requires the presence of exogenous trypsin in culture medium (Li et al., 2016). Previous reports have shown that cleavage of PEDV S protein by trypsin occurs after viral receptor binding (Li et al., 2016; Park et al., 2011; Wicht et al., 2014). However, the detailed mechanism of proteolytic activation of PEDV S protein by proteases is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of proteases in PEDV entry focusing on the endosomal escape by confocal microscopy. Using two cell-culture-adapted PEDV strains that require trypsin (PEDV KD) or pancreatic elastase (PEDV AA) in cell culture for virus replication (Kim et al., 2017), we examined if exogenous proteases are involved in the endosomal escape of PEDV for efficient viral replication. We also investigated the roles of endogenous proteases (cathepsin B and L) in the endosomes/lysomes and endosome maturation in PEDV replication in correlation with the endosomal escape.",

Therefore, PEDV cellular trafficking with or without protease (and its inhibitor) was investigated by confocal microscopy. Vero cells were seeded onto Lab-Tek\u2122 II CC2\u2122 chamber slide (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), treated with 5% FBS and grown to 70% confluency. Mock or PEDV KD or AA at an MOI of 50 were inoculated into the confluent cells on the chamber slides, and the virus-infected cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. After washing with PBS for 3 times, the cells were subject to the following treatment for 1 h, 4 h, 6 h or 8 h prior to confocal microscopy. The treatments are: 1) Cells infected with PEDV KD were incubated with Mock (no trypsin), TPCK-treated trypsin (1 \u03bcg/ml) or TPCK-treated trypsin (1 \u03bcg/ml) + trypsin inhibitor (leupeptin, \u22121 \u03bcM); 2) Cells infected with PEDV AA strain were incubated with Mock (no trypsin), elastase (1 \u03bcg/ml) or elastase (1 \u03bcg/ml) + Elastatinal (5 \u03bcM); 3) Cells infected with KD were incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin with or without cathepsin inhibitors [Z-FL-COCHO (10 \u03bcM) or CA074-Me (40 \u03bcM)] or chloroquine (75 \u03bcM). To prepare cells for confocal microscopy, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature (RT) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton x-100 (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 10 min at RT. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. After washing with PBS for three times, cells were further incubated with primary antibody to PEDV (1:200) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC labeled secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS. Cell nucleus was stained with sytox orange (0.5 \u03bcM in 0.9% NaCl). To determine the intracellular location of PEDV, the KD-infected cells fixed at 6 and 12 h PI were incubated with the PEDV antibody and mouse monoclonal antibody against VPS26A (endosome marker) or PDIA3 (ER marker), followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies with FITC and AlexFluor\u00ae594. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong\u00ae Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), and the cells were scanned with a confocal microscope LSM 510 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a 100x oil-immersion objective lens.

            "text": "Many viruses, including PEDV, utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis to gain entry into the host cells (Park et al., 2014). During the endocytic entry processes, viruses or viral genome translocate to cytoplasm (endosomal escapes) and initiate virus replication. Because the endosomal escape of virus is critical for successful virus replication, viruses utilize various mechanisms for the events (Grove and Marsh, 2011; Gruenberg and van der Goot, 2006; Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Early endosomes become progressively acidic as they mature into late endosomes and eventually into lysosomes. Endosomal proteases have been implicated in the crucial roles by digesting and processing of proteins transported in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments [reviewed in (Muller et al., 2012)]. The S protein of SARS coronavirus and the Glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus are cleaved by endosomal proteases, such as cathepsin L and B, to expose a putative fusion domain (Chandran et al., 2005; Cote et al., 2011; Ebert et al., 2002; Grove and Marsh, 2011). For reovirus, a non-enveloped virus, endosomal proteases remove the outer-capsid protein \u03c33, which exposes the protein \u03bc1. The \u03bc1protein is involved in viral membrane-penetration, which allows the reovirus core particles to be delivered into cytoplasm for transcription of viral genome (Schiff, 1998). Recently we demonstrated that porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) requires endosomal cathepsins and bile acids that are supplemented in the medium for viral endosomal escape (Shivanna et al., 2014a, b; Shivanna et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The addition of exogenous trypsin (or other proteases) is absolutely required for the isolation of PEDV from field samples as well as efficient replication of most PEDV strains (Li et al., 2016). It has been shown that proteases activity is required for efficient PEDV replication at the post-viral attachment stage, but where and how they work during virus entry is not clearly understood. Using two different PEDV strains KD or AA that were adapted to grow in the presence of trypsin or elastase, respectively, we investigated the roles of proteases in PEDV replication focusing on the viral entry events. One-step growth kinetic study showed that viral replication (or RNA synthesis) occurs between 4\u201312 h PI (Fig. 1) in the presence of trypsin or elastase. Without trypsin, no significant replication of PEDV KD occurred, indicating that this strain is heavily dependent on the presence of trypsin for replication. PEDV AA replication was significantly hampered by the absence of elastase but, interestingly, limited viral replication occurred even without elastase (or elastase with its inhibitor) (Fig. 1). It is unclear how this limited viral replication occurs in the absence of elastase, but it is possible that it is associated with the fact that protease independent PEDV such as PEDV 8aa in our previous report (Kim et al., 2017) can be generated by passaging the virus in the absence of any protease. It is possible that minor population of the protease-independent PEDV may be generated spontaneously during the infection of PEDV KD or AA with trypsin or elastase, respectively, and elastase provides more favorable conditions for producing the protease-independent PEDV.",

During viral entry through receptors and endosomes, escaping of viral genomes from endosomes is critical for viral replication. Viral proteins in endosomes undergo conformational changes by decreasing pH and/or cleavage of viral proteins by host proteases in the endosomes, which leads to exposure of fusion domains or other mechanisms for membrane fusion and viral genome translocation to cytoplasm (Grove and Marsh, 2011; Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Recently, our group has demonstrated the crucial events of the endosomal escape of PEDV and caliciviruses using the confocal microscopy (Kim et al., 2017; Shivanna et al., 2014b, 2015). In that confocal microscopy study, the fluorescence signals for PEDV and caliciviruses co-localized with the endosome marker Rab7, and viral escape from the endosomes occurred at 3 h PI (Kim et al., 2017; Shivanna et al., 2014b, 2015).",

Both PEDV KD and AA were detected in the endosomes at 1 h PI regardless of the presence or absence of trypsin or elastase, but viral florescence signals disappeared at 4 h PI only in the presence of trypsin or elastase (Fig. 3A for PEDV KD and 3B for PEDV AA). These suggested both PEDV KD and AA were able to escape from the endosomes at 4 h PI only in the presence of protease. At 6 h PI, viral signals were detected on perinuclear areas for both PEDV KD and AA in the presence of trypsin and elastase, respectively (Fig. 4A), and the signals were co-localized with ER marker (PDI3A) (only PEDV KD was shown in Fig. 4B), suggesting active viral protein synthesis (with replication). Without proteases, viral signals remained at endosomes (co-localized with an endosome marker, VPS26A) at 6 h PI (Fig. 4A and 4B) or later time points up to 24 h PI (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous report with viral trafficking through endosomes, and interference with the proper viral escapes led to significantly reduction of viral replication (Kim et al., 2017; Shivanna et al., 2014b, 2015).",

A previous study using the pseudovirus of PEDV reported that PEDV S protein is activated by cathepsins, and a lysosomal acidification inhibitor, or lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitors including cathepsin B (CA074) and L (Z-FY-CHO) inhibitors significantly reduced pseudovirus entry and PEDV replication (Liu et al., 2016). The results from this study are consistent with the previous study (Liu et al., 2016) demonstrating that cathepsins are required PEDV entry.

In addition to exogenous protease, cathepsins in the endosomes are required for successful endosomal escape of PEDV. In the absence of protease, PEDV remains in the late endosomes/lysosomes and is destined to be degraded.",
