To do so, it systematises the European response into separate stages. Phase 1the emergencyhas been characterised by the adoption of national emergency risk management measures that, albeit country specific, were inspired by a common objective of pandemic suppression (ie to reduce disease transmission and thereby diminish pressure on health services) under the by now well-known \"flatten the curve\" imperative. Phase 2the liftingis about the attempt at relaxing some of the national risk responses in a coordinated fashion to avoid creating negative spill-overs or distortionsbe they sanitary and/or financialacross the EU. Lastly, this article strives to define, and possibly predict, the regulatory policy framework that might be governing the next phases of the European risk management response to this pandemic as they will emerge from a widely undefined yet inescapable dialectic between the EU and its Member States.",

PHASE 1: FROM DIVERGENCE TO CONVERGENCE THROUGH REGULATORY EMULATION Caught by surprise by the spread of the virus across the continent, 4 national and EU political leaders found themselves overtaken by an emergency situation. Yet, a pandemic disease of these proportions not only had been predicted, 5 but also had been identified in the preceding weeks as a high-impact, imminent threat to the European region (and the rest of the world) by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). 6 Due to such unpreparedness combined with the gradual time-spatial transmission of COVID-19, the outbreak prompted initially different risk regulatory responses across EU Member States. However, despite some hesitation and a few controversial outliers, notably the UK and Sweden, 7 Member States have swiftly converged on a very similar risk response: suppression as opposed to mere mitigation of the virus. 8",

The chosen NPA essentially translates into a set of specific \"social distancing measures\", operationalised through regulatory requirements and/or recommendations. Social distancing measures can be listed from the least intrusive and targeted to the most wide in scope: (1) isolation of cases (infected); (2) quarantine of contacts (healthy individuals); (3) stay-at-home recommendations; (4) school closures; (5) workplace closures; (6) measures for special populations, such as long-term health facilities or jails; (7) mass gathering cancellations; (8) cordon sanitaire/mandatory quarantine of a building or residential area(s); and ultimately (9) social distancing of entire population. In the latter case, all households reduce contact outside the household, school or workplace, as they cannot leave their house unless to buy essential products or other contingencies strictly defined. 10 As a result, virtually all Member States, albeit affected to different degrees by the virus, required some forms of social distancing of the entire population. This, however, occurred through a different country-by-country \"regulatory mix\" of social distancing measures, be they the prohibition of public gatherings or workplace and school closures (total or partial), as well as the introduction of travel restrictions 11both for intra-state and intra-EU mobility. In addition, virtually all member states have been combining these mandatory interventions with other NPAsmostly via voluntary measures 12such as:",

In addition to the adoption of dedicated national COVID-19 risk management policies, more than half of the Member States have proclaimed states of emergency ( Figure 2 ). 13 Phase 1 of COVID-19 in the EU was therefore initially characterised by regulatory variation across Member States, but was promptly interrupted by spontaneous regulatory convergence. In this initial phase, albeit affected to different degrees by the virus, Member States realised that, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the nature and spread of the disease, the most responsible course of action was to take the most risk-averse position. Suddenly, the incentives for governments were no longer to identify the most effective course of action based on available contextspecific costs and benefits, but rather to emulate the risk responses of the countries hit first by the pandemic. This occurred even when they harboured doubts as to whether they were the best approaches possible. This phenomenon of rapid regulatory convergence prompted by an emergency and an inherent path-dependence dynamic has been defined \"copycat coronavirus policies\". 14 It fundamentally boils down to an instance of \"regulatory emulation\", driven by a combination of unmeasurable uncertainty and public pressure in a situation of emergency. 15 11 D Thym, \"Travel Bans in Europe: A Legal Appraisal,\" VerfBlog, 19 March 2020 <https://verfassungsblog.de/ travel-bans-in-europe-a-legal-appraisal>. 12 While only a few countries have mandated the use of masks by the general population (eg Czechia, Austria, etc.), the unfolding of the COVID-19 outbreak has considerably accelerated the number of countries recommending their use. At the time of writing, the pan-European guidance by the ECDC states: \"The use of face masks in the community should be considered only as a complementary measure and not as a replacement for established preventive measures, for example physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, meticulous hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face, nose, eyes and mouth\"; see European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Using Face Masks in the Community (Stockholm, ECDC 2020). 13 As examined in the Verfassungsblog's \"Fighting COVID 19\" debate <https://verfassungsblog.de/category/ debates/fighting-covid-19-debates>. 14 I Krastev, \"Copycat Coronavirus Policies Will Soon Come to an End\", Financial Times, 7 April 2020. 15 For an initial attempt at theorising on the concept of emergency risk regulation, see A Alemanno (ed.), Governing Disasters: The Challenges of Emergency Risk Regulation (Cheltenham, Edward Elgar 2011).",

It essentially introduces a set of meta-criteria or benchmarks framing the exercise of Member States' public health prerogatives. In so doing, it also leaves each Member State the choice, depending on their size and organisation, regarding \"what level of compliance with the criteria above should be assessed\" (eg the regional or macro-regional level rather than at the national level). This roadmap, together with a flurry of new documents freshly produced under time pressures by the EU Commission through its above-described public health emergencies bodies, represents an attempt at internalising the cross-border effects that are inherent to any national risk response in a highly integrated and interdependent EU. These guidance documents include the \"COVID-19 Guidelines for Border Management Measures to Protect Health and Ensure the Availability of Goods and Essential Services\", 32 the \"Guidelines on EU Emergency Assistance in Cross-Border Cooperation in Healthcare related to the COVID-19 crisis\", 33 the \"Recommendation App on Contact Tracing (The Toolbox)\" 34 and the proposed \"Guidance for Common Testing Strategies\". While adopted in a situation of emergency, these guidance documents show a timid yet auspicious attempt by the EU to operationalise untested competences contained in the Treaties and to do so in a situation of emergency.",
