Table 3 shows the frequencies of the organisms isolated in each group. The overall incidence of bacteremia was 31.3 % and there were not differences among the three groups (Electronic Supplemental Material, Table 1). S. pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in each of the three groups, but the incidence differed among groups (HCAP, 19.5 %; CAP, 34.2 %; and ICP, 23.4 %; p = 0.001). The ICP and HCAP groups had the highest incidence of P. aeruginosa (p = 0.08), and the HCAP group had the highest incidence of MRSA (p = 0.04). The PRMO was identified in 13 patients in the HCAP group (9.7 %), 10 in the ICP group (6.9 %), and 15 in the CAP group (3.4 %) (p = 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, the factor most strongly associated with isolation of potentially resistant microorganisms was HCAP (OR 2.79; 95 % CI = 1.27\u20136.12; p = 0.01). Among 13 patients in the HCAP group with PRMO, previous hospital admission (43.1 %) and previous antibiotic therapy (38.5 %) were the most frequent risk factors. The incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in the CAP group, 14.4 % in the HCAP group, and 21.8 % in the ICP group (p < 0.001). In the CAP group, 13.7 % of patients received inappropriate antibiotic therapy because of the isolation of PRMO (2 P. aeruginosa, 1 MRSA, 1 Klebsiella sp.); in the HCAP group, 26.3 % of patients received inappropriate antibiotic therapy because of the isolation of PRMO (2 MRSA, 1 P. aeruginosa, 1 S. maltophilia, 1 Klebsiella sp.). In the ICP group the inappropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with the isolation of PRMO. Empirical treatment was in line with CAP guidelines (without coverage of P. aeruginosa or MRSA) in 73.5 % of patients in the CAP group; in 45.5 % of those in the HCAP group, and in 40 % of those in the ICP. Interestingly in the HCAP group, P. aeruginosa was isolated in 3 out of 54 COPD patients (5.6 %), compared to 71 non-COPD patients with only 1 isolation of P. aeruginosa isolation; however, because of the low number of cases this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.30).

Our results confirm these findings, although we found no significant difference in mortality. Our population consisted of critical patients who had not been denied admission to the ICU, so patients with treatment limitations prior to ICU admission were excluded a priori. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, our HCAP group excluded immunocompromised patients, and the ICP group had a significantly higher mortality. In fact, in the multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression was significantly associated with a worse prognosis.",

Our results also reinforce the idea that this heterogeneous group of patients in whom risk varies with the diseases process should not be included among HCAP patients. It is important to consider disease-specific characteristics (febrile neutropenia in cancer, CD4 count in HIV) when making treatment decisions in patients with ICP [23], and specific guidelines include recommendations for immunocompromised patients with pneumonia [24, 25]. In the multicenter study done in the UK [8], in which the definition of HCAP also excluded immunocompromised patients, the mortality was similar to that in our study. The higher mortality in patients with HCAP in previous studies may in part be related to greater treatment restrictions and the inclusion of immunosuppressed patients.",

However, more recent studies about HCAP have shown differences between countries and regions in the etiology of patients with HCAP [2\u20134, 6\u20138]. In Europe the incidence of resistant pathogens is lower, and pathogens that cause HCAP are more similar to those that cause CAP than to those that cause hospital-acquired pneumonia [26]. Chalmers et al. [8] and Grenier et al. [27] in Canada reported similar findings. These data contrast with those from the USA and the Asia/Pacific [2\u20135] region, where the incidences of P. aeruginosa and MRSA are much higher and S. pneumoniae accounted for less than 10 % of cases.",

However, the observational nature of this study allows us to better understand the current medical prescriptions in the ICU. Second, the diagnostic techniques were not standardized and this may also have influenced the incidence of the etiologic diagnosis in the different hospitals. Third, the low incidence of MRSA in the community might reflect differences in out-of-hospital resources with other countries, and our results can not be extrapolated to other countries where Pseudomonas sp. and MRSA are more prevalent. Fourth, more than 50 % of patients with HCAP had received antibiotics within the 6 month prior to ICU admission, but we did not have information about if these patients had received the antibiotic immediately before the microbiological samples were taken. A lower number of positive results of cultures in the HCAP group may have influenced these results. Fifth, we did not have information about patients with HCAP who were denied admission to the ICU; however, these patients probably might not have had limitation of life support for ICU admission.
