European rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus, acquired for antiserum production, developed a highly fatal disease characterized by numerous mucinous skin tumors. Sanarelli (1898) named the disease \u201cinfectious myxomatosis of rabbits\u201d and, since no microbial agents were detected, proposed that the disease was caused by a newly recognized group of infectious agents known as \u201cfilterable viruses.\u201d The virus which caused the first known outbreak of myxomatosis is believed to have originated from the Tapeti or tropical forest rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis) in which the virus causes relatively mild disease. Transmission from wild to domestic rabbits probably occurred via mosquitos of the genus Aedes (Aragao, 1943; Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

The disease was first recognized in North America in 1928 when natural outbreaks of a fatal disease of rabbits occurred in several rabbit colonies near San Diego, California (Kessel et al., 1931). The virus which caused the first outbreaks in southern California may have been introduced into the United States from Mexico by importation of infected domestic rabbits (Vail and McKenney, 1943). The disease is endemic in the western United States, where the brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani) is the natural reservoir of the virus (Marshall and Regnery, 1960; Regnery and Miller, 1972).",

Although the virus was first introduced into Australia in 1926, for more than two decades it was used only in experimental studies aimed at determining its feasibility as a control measure for rabbits. In 1950, the virus was released into the wild rabbit population where, after a somewhat slow start, it became established and spread rapidly, decimating the rabbit population of the continent by 1953. The disease is now endemic in the wild rabbit population of Australia, where it occasionally assumes epidemic proportions when climatic conditions favor vector activity. Within a decade following release of myxoma virus into the rabbit population, it became evident that through a process of natural selection genetically resistant strains of rabbits had emerged. In these rabbits, a virulent strain of myxoma virus caused only 25% mortality compared to 90% mortality in non-resistant strains of rabbits (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). The passage of time has resulted in further, often regional, increases in the resistance of Australian rabbits (Williams et al., 1990).",

The Berry\u2013Dedrick phenomenon of poxvirus reactivation was confirmed by Smith (1952), who demonstrated a spectrum of virulence for strains of myxoma and fibroma viruses. Fenner and Marshall (1957), in a study involving 92 strains of virus, established a virulence spectrum ranging from strains causing over 99% mortality in European rabbits to others causing less than 30% mortality. The most virulent strains were the Standard Laboratory, Lausanne, and California strains, whereas the least virulent were the neuromyxoma and Nottingham strains. Ecological pressures such as those previously described in Australia could have been responsible for the emergence of many of these strains of viruses. In many instances, however, viruses have been manipulated in the laboratory to the point of permanent modification (Kilham, 1957, 1958).",

Myxoma virus is readily propagated at 35\u00b0C on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens\u2019 eggs, forming distinct pocks (Fenner and McIntyre, 1956). Different strains of virus cause pocks of various sizes, the variation being sufficiently distinct to allow tentative strain identification. The South American strains cause large pocks, whereas the California strains produce small focal lesions on the membrane (Fenner and Marshall, 1957). The virus can also be propagated in cell cultures derived from rabbits and other species, including chicken, squirrel, rat, hamster, guinea pig, and human (Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965; Porterfield, 1989). Distinct differences in plaque size on rabbit kidney cell cultures can be demonstrated between the South American and California strains, the former causing much larger plaques (Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965). The most sensitive method for isolation of myxoma virus under laboratory conditions is inoculation of the skin of European rabbits (Fenner and McIntyre, 1956).",

In the forested area of Argentina the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reservoir is the wild European rabbit (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). The California strains of myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus (Porterfield, 1989), are endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, especially S. bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits (Marshall et al., 1963). In Australia, the myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Following the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myxomatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit (O. cuniculus) serving as the predominant host species.",

Because transmission occurs by mechanical transport of virus on mouth parts, the species of mosquito is unimportant, and thus any mosquito which feeds on rabbits (Grodhaus et al., 1963), as well as biting flies and gnats (Mykytowycz, 1957), may serve as vectors. The source of virus is usually the superficial layers of the skin, especially of the eyelids and at the base of the ears (Fenner and Woodroofe, 1953), where surface-feeding arthropods such as mites and lice may obtain the virus and serve as mechanical vectors. Experimentally, virus can spread from infected to uninfected rabbits in the absence of arthropod vectors, and such contact transmission may occur under natural conditions in rabbit warrens (Mykytowycz, 1958, 1961). Windborne spread was suspected in France (Arthur and Louzis, 1988), and myxomatosis may have reached England from France in 1953 by this mode of transmission (Sellers, 1987). Transmission of myxoma virus by contaminated spines of thistles (Circium vulgare) has been described (Dyce, 1961; Mykytowycz, 1961). The claws of predatory birds and carrion feeders, such as buzzards and crows, may be contaminated with virus, and such birds may play a role in dissemination of the virus (Borg and Bakos, 1963).",

In California, it has been shown experimentally that Anopheles freeborni, Aedes serriensis, A. aegypti, Culiseta incidens, and Culex tarsalis can transmit myxoma virus between S. bachmani (Grodhaus et al., 1963). The virus was isolated from wild-caught A. freeborni in an area of myxomatosis outbreaks, further implicating it as a possible vector (Marshall and Regnery, 1960). In Australia, the disease spreads along river valleys, the main vector mosquitoes being Culex annulirostris, Anopheles annulipes, Culex pipiens australicus, and several Aedes species (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). Although black flies (Simulium spp.) are possible vectors in Australia, only Simulium melatun has been conclusively shown to be a vector (Mykytowycz, 1957). Stickfast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) and the cat flea, C. felis, can transmit the virus, and the louse (Haemodispus ventricosus) and fur mite (Cheyletiella parasitivorax) are also vectors (Mykytowcyz, 1958).",

The flea reproduced in wild rabbit populations and transmitted both introduced and field strains of myxoma virus (Sobey and Conolly, 1971; Shepherd and Edmonds, 1977). As a result of flea introduction, myxomatosis has become more prevalent in drier tableland areas (Parer and Korn, 1989), and outbreaks of myxomatosis have shifted from summer to spring (Shepherd and Edmonds, 1978; Shepherd et al., 1978). In France, there is evidence that mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are the principal vectors of summer epidemics. The rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is probably a major vector, especially during winter months when mosquito activity is low (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

            "text": "Myxomatosis in Britain is characterized by milder seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence than in Australia, California, and France (Ross and Tittensor, 1986). Mosquitoes play a minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector (Lockley, 1954; Armour and Thompson, 1955; Andrewes et al., 1959; Mead-Briggs, 1964). The myxoma virus in Britain has not undergone the rapid loss of virulence observed with the Australian and French viruses. The increase in resistance to myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of myxoma virus (Ross and Sanders, 1987). While mildly virulent strains have emerged in Britain, the predominant strains are moderately virulent (Chappie and Bowen, 1963; Chappie and Lewis, 1964; Fenner and Chappie, 1965), with recent estimates of between 47 and 69% mortality in infected rabbits (Ross et al., 1989). The different evolution of myxoma virus in Britain has been attributed to the fact that the the virus is predominantly flea transmitted. The flea is less seasonal and less mobile than the mosquito. That fleas move in large numbers from dead animals while moving only occasionally from live ones would seem to favor transmission of virulent virus strains (Fenner and Marshall, 1957). The proportion of infective fleas produced is inversely related to the survival time of rabbits following infection (Mead-Briggs and Vaughan, 1975). The flea is also an effective reservoir of virus, possessing a longer life span than mosquitoes. The life span of active female mosquitoes is usually 2\u20133 weeks, whereas fleas have been known to feed actively for over 1 year. The myxoma virus can persist for 105 days in rabbit fleas with no rabbit contact in artificial burrows (Chappie and Lewis, 1965).",

These nodules usually appear 4 to 8 days after exposure to the virus and may persist for up to 40 days. Young rabbits may succumb to generalized disease following infection with myxoma virus (Aragao, 1943). In the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), skin tumors, rarely more than 1 cm in diameter, develop at the base of one or both ears (Regnery and Miller, 1972). Experimental inoculation of S. bachmani with the South American and California strains results in development of local skin tumors, with the South American virus causing slightly more prominent tumors than the California virus (Marshall and Regnery, 1963). Cottontail rabbits (S. floridanus, Sylvilagus nuttalli, and Sylvilagus auduboni) develop small lesions at the site of California virus inoculation, but in S. nuttalli and S. auduboni the South American virus induces a larger lesion (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

The skin tumors result from proliferation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, which become large stellate (myxoma) cells surrounded by a homogeneous matrix of mucinous material interspersed with capillaries and inflammatory cells (Figs. 3\nand 4\n). It is because of this mucinous substance that the tumors are referred to as myxomas and the disease myxomatosis. Vascular endothelial proliferation with narrowing of the lumen and extrusion of stellate cells has been described by Hurst (1937a), who considered this lesion characteristic of myxomatosis. Central necrosis of myxomas may be attributed to occlusion of blood vessels by endothelial proliferation. Epithelial cells overlying the tumor may appear normal in early tumors, or show hyperplasia or degeneration. Intracytoplasmic inclusions, in various cells types, are especially prominent in the basal layer of the skin (Rivers and Ward, 1937; Patton and Holmes, 1977).",

Infection with the California viruses may be harder to diagnose, however, owing to the frequent absence of skin nodules and other signs of disease. Diagnosis should be confirmed by virus isolation. The technique of choice is intracutaneous inoculation of young susceptible rabbits with fresh tissue collected from lesions free of bacterial contamination. Lesions should develop at the site of inoculation within 1 week. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of 11- to 13-day-old embryonated chicken eggs followed by incubation at 35\u00b0C for 4 to 6 days. Distinct focal pocks develop if the virus is present. The South American viruses cause large pocks, the California virus intermediate sized pocks, and the fibroma virus minute pocks. Virus isolation on chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures or any one of several cell types can also be accomplished. The virus isolated can be identified as myxoma virus by a direct fluorescent antibody test (Takahashi et al., 1958, 1959), the plaque-neutralization test (Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965), or the agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation test (Fenner, 1965). Infection of Sylvilagus rabbits with myxoma virus clinically resembles fibromatosis and should be differentiated from the latter disease by inoculation of young susceptible rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Myxomatosis causes severe to fatal disease, whereas fibromatosis causes a localized fibroma.",

Fibroma virus has been used as a live vaccine for myxomatosis, but results have been variable (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). A live attenuated myxomatosis vaccine (the MSD strain) results in a mild reaction followed by immunity persisting for 9 months (McKercher and Saito, 1964). Jiran et al. (1970) found this virus to be too virulent for use as a vaccine and further attenuated it by serial passage in rabbit kidney cell cultures. The additionally modified virus, designated MSD/B, was safe and highly immunogenic. Other attenuated strains have been used as vaccines in Europe with some success, and experiments with a live virus vaccine (SG-33) using a flea, Xenopsylla cunicularis, as the vector appear promising (Delobette, 1991).",

The virus was transmissible to cottontail and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), producing localized fibromas in both species. Shope (1932a) described the gross and microscopic lesions of both the natural and experimental disease and identified the causative agent as a virus (Shope, 1932b). He showed that it was antigenically related to myxoma virus. Similarities between fibroma and myxoma viruses have subsequently been confirmed by cross-immunity tests (Shope, 1936), ether sensitivity (Andrewes and Horstmann, 1949; Fenner, 1953), virus-reactivation studies (Berry and Dedrick, 1936), and microprecipitation procedures (Fenner, 1965). The fibroma virus, initially believed to cause only localized benign fibromas, was later shown to cause severe generalized disease in newborn European (Duran-Reynals, 1940; Joiner et al., 1971) and cottontail rabbits (Yuill and Hanson, 1964). The disease is historically considered a benign endemic disease of wild cottontail rabbits, of little economic significance to commercial rabbit producers or laboratory investigators. However, an epidemic of fibromatosis in a commercial rabbitry resulting in high morbidity and mortality in newborn rabbits was reported in 1971 (Joiner et al., 1971). Thus, the disease can be a threat to commercial rabbits in areas where it is endemic in wild rabbit populations and outdoor husbandry practices permit contact with arthropod vectors.",

The virus is antigenically similar to both fibroma and myxoma viruses and is considered a recombinant of the two viruses (Block et al., 1985). The virus induces a syndrome of severe immunosuppression resulting in disseminated malignancy and opportunistic infections (Strayer et al., 1983a \u2013 c; Corbeil et al., 1983; Strayer and Sell, 1983; Skaletsky et al., 1984).

The chemical and physical characteristics of fibroma virus have been summarized by Gross (1983). The virus can be propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos, but characteristic lesions as observed with myxoma virus are not produced (Gross, 1983). The virus has been propagated in cell cultures derived from rats, guinea pigs, and humans (Chaproniere and Andrewes, 1957) and also in rabbit cell cultures derived from cottontail and domestic rabbits (Constantin et al., 1956; Kilham, 1956; Padgett et al., 1962; Hinze and Walker, 1964; Kasza, 1974). Fibroma virus in cultured rabbit kidney cells induces pronounced changes in cell growth and morphology, and inoculation of virus-transformed cells into the cheek pouch of hamsters results in tumor formation (Hinze and Walker, 1964).",

The tumors are subcutaneous, unattached to underlying tissues, and may persist for several months, and in some instances for nearly a year (Kilham and Dalmat, 1955).

The pathological changes in the only reported natural outbreak of fibromatosis in European rabbits were described by Joiner et al. (1971). The earliest gross lesion in experimentally infected cottontail rabbits is a slight thickening of the subcutaneous tissue, followed by development of clearly demarcated soft swellings usually evident 6 days after inoculation. The tumors enlarge, increase in density, and usually reach maximum size by 12 days. The average size of the tumors is 4\u20136 cm with a thickness of 2 cm. Tumors may persist for months before regressing, leaving the rabbit essentially normal. Experimentally infected newborn cottontail rabbits may die of generalized fibromatosis. Under natural conditions, however, this form of the disease has not been observed. Gross lesions in experimentally infected European rabbits are similar to those observed in cottontail rabbits, but regression of the tumors occurs more rapidly.",

Many tumor cells may have large intracytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of poxvirus infections. Mononuclear leukocyte cuffing of vessels adjacent to the tumor may be observed, and a pronounced accumulation of lymphocytes at the base of the tumor is often seen. Degeneration of the overlying epidermis may result from pressure ischemia, followed by necrosis and sloughing of the epithelium and tumor. In many instances, however, the tumors regress without epithelial sloughing. Regression is usually complete within 2 months after appearance of tumors.

The biological properties of the Utrecht (Jansen, 1941) and Rockefeller (Greene, 1934a) strains of rabbitpox viruses are indistinguishable from certain neurovaccinia strains (Fenner, 1958; Fenner et al., 1989). The close antigenic relationship between rabbitpox virus and vaccinia virus, taken together with the fact that all reported outbreaks of rabbitpox have occurred in laboratory colonies, suggests that rabbitpox may be a laboratory variant of vaccinia virus (Greene, 1935a; Verlinde and Wersinck, 1951). Wittek et al. (1977) used genome mapping to show that rabbitpox virus (Utrecht strain) was a strain of vaccinia virus. Rabbitpox virus can be propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos with development of distinct pocks. The predominant pock type is hemorrhagic (Jansen, 1946), but white pock mutants have been described (Fenner and Sambrook, 1966; Fenner et al., 1989). Rabbitpox virus has been propagated in several cell lines, including HeLa, Chang Liver, L929 (mouse fibroblast), human heart, KB (human epithelial), FL (human amnion), AT (Chinese hamster epithelial), PK-2A (pig kidney), and FAF cells (Chinese hamster fibroblast) (Christensen et al., 1967). The Rockefeller strain of rabbitpox virus hemagglutinates chicken erythrocytes, but the Utrecht strain and the strain isolated from the first American outbreak of pockless rabbitpox do not (Christensen et al., 1967).",

The highest mortality occurs in young rabbits and pregnant or lactating females (Greene, 1934a, 1935b). Differences in susceptibility by rabbit breed also occur (Greene, 1935b). Within infected colonies, the spread of disease is extremely rapid, and, in the outbreak of 1932, removal and isolation of infected rabbits failed to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the colony (Greene, 1934a). The virus appears to spread via nasal discharges, which usually appear on the third day after infection. Airborne droplets may be inhaled or ingested by susceptible rabbits (Bedson and Duckworth, 1963). Recovery from infection does not appear to result in establishment of a carrier state, as recovered rabbits can be safely mated with susceptible rabbits and clean colonies derived from recovered stock (Greene, 1934a). Arthropods have not been shown to play a role in the epidemiology of rabbitpox infection. In general, the primary sources of infection resulting in outbreaks of disease have not been determined, although the origin may have been rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus (Greene, 1935a).",

The virus initially infects and multiplies in the nasal mucosa and later in lymph nodes of the respiratory tract and in the lungs and spleen. Fever and a profuse nasal discharge usually occur 2 to 3 days after infection. Another early sign is enlargement and induration of the lymph nodes, especially the popliteal and inguinal nodes, which usually persist throughout the course of disease. Widely distributed skin lesions usually appear about 5 days after infection, initially as an erythematous macular rash which becomes papular and may progress to nodules up to 1 cm in size. These nodules eventually form dry, superficial crusts. Macules and papules may also occur on the mucous membranes of the oral and nasal cavities. Extensive edema of the face and oral cavity is often observed, as is focal necrosis of the hard palate and the gums. Hemorrhages in the skin may occur in severe cases.",

In the first Dutch outbreak, some rabbits died within 1 week after infection, with only anorexia, fever, and lethargy (Jansen, 1941).

The virus was detected when focal areas of cell destruction were observed in cell monolayers 14 days after incubation. The virus has since been propagated in kidney cells of both cottontail and domestic rabbits. Another herpesvirus, apparently distinct from the original isolate of Hinze (1971a), was recovered from primary kidney cell cultures of S. floridanus (Cebrian et al., 1989).",

Although infectious virus could not be demonstrated in lymphocytes from infected cottontail rabbits, it could be detected after in vitro cocultivation with rabbit kidney cells (Hinze and Wegner, 1973; Wegner and Hinze, 1974). The virus is strongly cell-associated (Ley and Burger, 1970), and both B and T lymphocytes are infected (Kramp et al., 1985). The virus can be propagated in cells of both cottontail and domestic rabbits but not in cells from humans, monkeys, hamsters, and mice, nor in chicken embryos. The highest concentrations of virus are obtained by the use of primary kidney cell lines established from newborn or juvenile cottontail rabbits (Fig. 7\n) (Cohrs and Rouhandeh, 1982; Medveczky et al., 1984). The virus possesses no antigenic relationship to Leporid herpesvirus 2 or to four other mammalian herpesviruses (Hinze, 1971a). The virus is a gamma herpesvirus (Cohrs and Rouhandeh, 1987; Rouhandeh and Cohrs, 1987), in the family Herpesviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). The genome of the virus is similar to those of Herpesvirus saimiri and Epstein-Barr virus, in that it contains a variable number of repetitive DNA elements at both ends (Heine and Hinze, 1972; Medveczky et al., 1989).",

Comparison of the reported characteristics of virus III with Herpesvirus cuniculi, however, indicates that they are identical (Nesburn, 1969). Virus III was isolated during attempts to find the etiologic agent of varicella (chicken pox). When inoculated into rabbits, the agent induced fever, exanthema, skin vesicles, corneal lesions, and intranuclear inclusions reminiscent of varicella infection (Rivers and Tillett, 1923). Convalescent sera from human varicella patients failed to inactivate the virus (Rivers and Tillett, 1924a). A similar virus was isolated from serially passaged normal rabbit testicular tissue during investigations of the etiology of rheumatic fever (Miller et al., 1924). McCartney isolated the virus while working on scarlet fever in England (Topacio and Hyde, 1932), and the agent has also been isolated by Doerr in Switzerland (Andrewes, 1928).",

Neutralizing antibodies to the virus were detected in 6% of 196 rabbits from Connecticut and Maryland (Swack and Hsiung, 1972). Nesburn (1969) was unable to reisolate the virus from over 100 batches of primary rabbit kidney cell cultures prepared since initial isolation of the virus.

However, a viral agent, presumably a herpesvirus, was recovered from the nares of rabbits with respiratory disease (Renquist and Soave, 1972). More recently, acute mortality associated with an unidentified herpesvirus was reported in four adult O. cuniculus in two rabbitries (Onderka et al., 1992). Herpesvirus was recovered on rabbit kidney cells, and experimental inoculation of rabbits with the virus reproduced the disease syndrome. In both reports, further characterization of the virus is indicated. Experimentally, intradermal inoculation of rabbits with virus results in pronounced erythema at the site of inoculation after 4 to 7 days, which usually disappears within 2 weeks (Rivers and Tillett, 1924a). Occasionally, generalized reactions with anorexia, diarrhea, emaciation, fever, and skin vesicles have been reported. Intradermal inoculation may result in erythematous papules, whereas corneal scarification caused swelling and vesiculation of corneal cells (Topacio and Hyde, 1932). Intratesticular inoculation of rabbits results in acute orchitis and fever within 3 to 4 days (Andrewes, 1928). Intramuscular and subcutaneous inoculation of rabbits failed to induce clinical signs; however, corneal scarification with virus resulted in mild punctate keratitis (Nesburn, 1969). Similarly, intraperitoneal inoculation of virus did not induce clinical disease (Swack and Hsiung, 1972).",

They demonstrated the filterability of the infectious agent, transmitted it to other cottontail rabbits as well as domestic rabbits (Shope, 1935), and described the histopathology of the disease. Rabbit papillomatosis was initially considered a natural benign disease of cottontail rabbits only; however, spontaneous outbreaks of papillomatosis in Oryctolagus cuniculus (Hagen, 1966) indicates that the disease has greater relevance. Soon after discovery of the virus, it was also shown to cause malignant neoplasms histologically resembling squamous cell carcinomas (Rous and Beard, 1934; 1935; Kidd and Rous, 1940). This was the first recognition of an oncogenic virus in mammals. The disease has served as a model system in numerous investigations aimed at the elucidation of the role of viruses in the etiology of cancer in humans and animals (Evans et al., 1962a,b; Evans and Thomsen, 1969; Kreider and Bartlett, 1981, 1985; Georges et al., 1984; Smith and Campo, 1985).",

The virus is antigenically distinct from other members of the genus Papillomavirus. Nuclear (Yoshida and Ito, 1968) and cytoplasmic (Ishimoto et al., 1970) viral antigens have been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in virus-inoculated normal skin cells and virus-induced papillomas. However, the significance of these findings is difficult to interpret since controls for rabbit kidney vacuolating virus, a passenger virus (Hartley and Rowe, 1964), were usually not included (Kreider and Bartlett, 1981). The virus can be maintained by serial propagation in the skin of cottontail rabbits, inoculated intracutaneously or scarified with virus (Shope and Hurst, 1933). Intramuscular inoculation does not result in clinical papillomatosis. Dogs, cats, pigs, goats, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are refractory to the virus. The skin of embryonic rats is susceptible to the virus, and typical papillomas develop following inoculation (Greene, 1953b); however, few papillomas develop, and they regress unless the host is immunosuppressed (Kreider et al., 1981).",

Infection of the skin of domestic rabbits results in the formation of papillomas essentially devoid of infectious virus (Shope, 1935). Papillomas can be serially transferred in rabbits, but infectious virus is seldom demonstrated (Shope, 1935; Selbie and Robinson, 1947), indicating that domestic rabbits are not a source of virus for arthropod vectors. However, Nartsissov, working with virus obtained from Shope, serially passaged the virus in domestic rabbits and demonstrated infectious virus in experimentally produced tumors (Gross, 1983).

Contact transmission of papillomatosis may occur, but transmission of the virus by the rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris) is probably the most common natural mode (Larson et al., 1936). Transmission by mosquitoes and reduviid bugs has been demonstrated experimentally (Dalmat, 1958), but, in view of the low frequency of ticks and bugs in commercial rabbitries, the mosquito may be the principal vector between wild cottontail and domestic rabbits (Hagen, 1966). This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that in natural cases of disease in domestic rabbits lesions were confined to the relatively hairless parts of the body around the eyes, ears, and anus, areas where mosquitoes are more apt to bite. Nematodes may be involved in the natural transmission of virus (Rendtorff and Wilcox, 1957). Experimentally, papillomas were induced when papillomavirus and larvae of the nematode Nippostrongylus muris were applied to rabbit skin, but not by virus or nematode larvae alone.",

The virus was initially believed to cause only transient papillomatosis, but it was later shown that in naturally infected cottontail rabbits papillomas may become malignant, being replaced by squamous cell carcinomas (Syverton and Berry, 1935). This phenomenon was later shown to be a relatively frequent occurrence in both naturally and experimentally infected cottontail rabbits, as 25% of infected rabbits developed carcinomatous lesions following infection (Syverton et al., 1950).

In areas where the disease is endemic in wild cottontail rabbits, where arthropod vectors are present, and where outdoor rabbit husbandry is practiced, arthropod control would appear to be a logical approach. Rabbits can be immunized by two intraperitoneal inoculations with glycerinated rabbit papilloma suspensions (Shope, 1937). Domestic rabbits with experimentally induced papillomas resisted challenge with virus derived from papillomas of cottontail rabbits (Hagen, 1966). A tumor-specific vaccine composed of allogenic tumor cells increased the regression rate of papillomas (Evans et al., 1962a).",

They transmitted the virus to both domestic and cottontail rabbits and by cross-immunity tests and tissue-susceptibility studies demonstrated that it was distinct from the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus. They also showed that virus is frequently present in the mouths of rabbits without lesions, and that tattooing or licking of tar stimulated lesion development in such carrier rabbits (Parsons and Kidd, 1943). A spontaneous outbreak in New York of rabbit oral papillomatosis, involving several breeds of domestic rabbits, was described (Weisbroth and Scher, 1970). New Zealand White rabbits with oral papillomas were reported in Illinois (Sundberg et al., 1985) and Mexico (Dominguez et al., 1981).",

The virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus. The virus is slightly smaller than the viruses of the genus Papillomavirus and resembles polyomavirus in size, morphology, and DNA composition (Crawford and Follett, 1967). The virus has been classified as a member of the genus Polyomavirus within the family Papovaviridae (Porterfield, 1989). Ultrastructurally, the virus is a typical papovavirus in its replication pattern (Chambers et al., 1966). The virus is not pathogenic for either domestic or cottontail rabbits or any other animal species. Inoculation of both neonatal and adult domestic and cottontail rabbits by several routes did not induce disease (Hartley and Rowe, 1964). Antibodies to the virus have been found in wild cottontail rabbits in Kansas and Maryland, but not in domestic rabbits (Hartley and Rowe, 1964). The virus thus appears to be a fairly common nonpathogenic virus of cottontail rabbits, causing only latent infections. Although a contaminant of rabbit papillomas, the virus appears to have no role in the pathogenesis of papillomatosis (Ito et al., 1968; Goldman et al., 1972; Kreider and Bartlett, 1981).",

Subsequently, parvovirus was recovered from kidney cells of neonatal rabbits in the United States (Metcalf et al., 1989). Among 90 rabbits from a commercial source in Japan, 42 (47%) had hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to the virus (Matsunaga et al., 1977). Of 46 rabbit sera, collected from various sources in the United States, 75% had antibodies detected by immunofluorescence or hemagglutination inhibition assays (Metcalf et al., 1989). In Switzerland, over 70% of 132 rabbit sera from various commercial breeding colonies had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition test (Metcalf et al., 1989). Experimental inoculation, orally or intravenously, induced anorexia, listlessness, and catarrhal enteritis in 1-month-old rabbits (Matsunaga and Chino, 1981). Virus was detected in feces, small intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen, appendix, and mesenteric lymph node. Rabbits developed hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies.",

Subsequently, rotavirus was isolated from young rabbits with diarrhea in Japan (Sato et al., 1982), Europe (Peeters et al., 1982, 1984; Eaton, 1984; Castrucci et al., 1985), and the United States (DiGiacomo and Thouless, 1986; Schoeb et al., 1986).

Although group A rotaviruses comprise 14 serotypes (Estes and Cohen, 1989), only serotype 3 is found in rabbits (Thouless et al., 1986; Tanaka et al., 1988). Serotype 3 is common to humans and several other animals and is defined by more than one epitope (Hoshino et al., 1984; Thouless et al., 1986). Some rotavirus isolates from rabbits induce a cytopathic effect in MA104 rhesus monkey kidney cells in about 3 days (Sato et al., 1982; Castrucci et al., 1985; Thouless et al., 1986), whereas other isolates demonstrate cytopathic effect only after additional passages. Physicochemical studies reveal that isolates are resistant to pH 3 and 20% ether and are partially sensitive to 10% chloroform (Castrucci et al., 1985). Additionally, they are inactivated when heated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, even in the presence of MgCl2.

Litters in such colonies have transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies to rotavirus at birth. In the absence of rotavirus infection, the antibodies fall to undetectable levels by 60 days of age. In colonies with endemic infection, shedding of rotavirus in the feces is detected in rabbits 4 to 7 weeks old (Peeters et al., 1984), followed by the appearance of naturally acquired antibodies in rabbits greater than 6 weeks old (DiGiacomo and Thouless, 1986). Subsequently, infected rabbits demonstrate antibodies for long periods. Hence, in infected colonies, rabbits usually acquire infection when maternal antibodies have declined to low concentrations, which usually coincides with weaning. Both sexes appear equally susceptible. Rotavirus infection in domesticated rabbits has been reported in New Zealand White, Dutch, and Californian rabbits, suggesting no difference in breed susceptibility (Bryden et al., 1976).",

Rabbits inoculated orally with rotavirus shed virus in the feces for 6 to 8 days, beginning 2 to 5 days after inoculation (Petric et al., 1978; Castrucci et al., 1984; Thouless et al., 1988; Conner et al., 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989). Furthermore, uninoculated control rabbits maintained in the same room with inoculated rabbits also acquired rotavirus infection (Thouless et al., 1988; Conner et al., 1988).

A spectrum in the severity of disease associated with rotavirus infection has been reported, which is probably influenced by a synergy among various microorganisms responsible for diarrheal diseases in rabbits. In outbreaks of diarrhea associated with rotavirus infection, rabbits 30\u201380 days old are usually affected (Sato et al., 1982; Castrucci et al., 1985; Peeters et al., 1984). Rabbits exhibit severe mucous or watery diarrhea, anorexia, and dehydration, with mortality of 60\u201380%. In one outbreak, rabbits 8 to 12 days old had a greenish-yellow watery diarrhea (Peeters et al., 1982). About 20% of litters were affected, with 98% mortality within 1 to 2 days after onset of signs. A similar disease was reported in a specific pathogen-free colony in which litters 7 to 21 days old exhibited watery diarrhea and lethargy (Schoeb et al., 1986). Approximately 40% of affected litters died within 2 days after onset of signs. That preweanling rabbits were affected in both outbreaks suggests that rotavirus had been recently introduced into the colonies.",

That rotavirus may be only mildly pathogenic is supported by experimental studies. In general, orogastric inoculation of rabbits, 1 to 22 weeks old, with rotavirus did not result in diarrhea, although some rabbits developed soft or fluid feces for 2 to 4 days (Petric et al., 1978; Thouless et al., 1988; Conner et al., 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989). Whereas inoculation of one rotavirus strain induced diarrhea, depression, anorexia, and mortality in rabbits (Castrucci et al., 1984), this could not be repeated (Hambraeus et al., 1989). Hence, in endemically infected colonies, other factors, including other infectious agents, may enhance the pathogenicity of rotavirus (Peeters et al., 1984).",

However, in both of the reports, the presence of other infectious agents was not examined. Peeters et al., (1984) reported that, in pure rotavirus infection, gross lesions are limited to fluid cecal contents and swollen mesenteric lymph nodes. Histologically, the small intestine shows moderate to severe villous atrophy, more marked in the ileum. Apical enterocytes on the tips of villi are swollen, rounded, and desquamating; occasionally tips are denuded. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and occasional neutrophils. Lesions in the cecum are limited to focal areas of enterocyte desquamation. In outbreaks involving preweanling rabbits, gross lesions are most pronounced in the ileum (Peeters et al., 1982). Microscopically, there is villous atrophy and attenuation or desquamation of epithelial cells at the apical tips of jejunal or ileal villi (Peeters et al., 1982; Schoeb et al., 1986). In some areas, the submucosa is edematous (Schoeb et al., 1986).",

Clinical signs and pathological findings alone are not diagnostic, although villous atrophy and degeneration and desquamation of enterocytes at the tips of villi in the small intestine are characteristic features. Rotaviral diarrhea must be differentiated from other diarrheal diseases of rabbits such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, Tyzzer's disease, clostridial enterotoxemia, and colibacillosis. In weanling rabbits with severe disease, the possibility of dual infections should be considered, since rotavirus infections are usually mild. Electron microscopy (Peeters et al., 1984; Schoeb et al., 1986) or a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can be used to detect rotavirus in feces (Thouless et al., 1986; 1988; Conner et al., 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989). Cytoplasmic fluorescence can be observed at the tips of ileal villi using indirect immunofluorescence (Petric et al., 1978). Serum antibodies to rotavirus can be detected by enzyme immunoassay (Thouless et al. 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989; Conner et al., 1991). Rabbits with rotaviral diarrhea usually have no or low concentrations of antibody to rotavirus, with a subsequent rise 2 to 4 weeks after onset of signs (Bryden et al., 1976; Sato et al., 1982). Nonaffected littermates develop high antibody concentrations, reflecting concurrent subclinical infections.",

Infection appears to be acute and self-limiting. Experimentally, virus is shed in the feces for about 1 week following inoculation (Petric et al., 1978; Castrucci et al., 1984; Thouless et al., 1988; Conner et al., 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989). Recovered rabbits are refractory to challenge with homologous (Castrucci et al., 1984; Conner et al., 1988, 1991; Hambraeus et al., 1989) or heterologous viruses (Hambraeus et al., 1989). Hence, cessation of breeding or quarantine of the colony for 4 to 6 weeks, to prevent the introduction of susceptible rabbits, should permit the infection to run its course. As seropositive dams are not infectious, their offspring should remain free of infection after maternal antibodies disappear. Early weaning of rabbits with high concentrations of passively acquired maternal antibodies and removal to isolated facilities offer the possibility of rederiving rabbits free of infection. Prevention of rotavirus infection depends on barrier maintenance of rabbits.",

As the principal necropsy finding was pleural effusion, the name pleural effusion disease was suggested (Fennestad et al., 1975). Later, it was shown that the major target organ was the heart, and the name infectious cardiomyopathy was suggested, since the etiologic agent appeared to be a coronavirus (Small et al., 1979). The resemblance of the clinicopathological features to feline infectious peritonitis, a systemic coronavirus infection of cats, was noted (Osterhaus et al., 1982). The failure to propagate the agent in vitro has precluded more definitive characterization. It is unclear whether the agent is a naturally occurring pathogen of rabbits or a virus from another species adapted to rabbits in contaminated treponemal stocks. However, the disease may be useful as a model for virus-induced cardiomyopathy (Baric et al., 1990; Edwards et al., 1992; Alexander et al., 1992; 1993).",

Rabbits developed fever, circulatory insufficiency with pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion and had high mortality (Gudjonsson and Skog, 1970; Gudjonsson et al., 1970). Subsequent inoculation of rabbits with pulmonary tissue and pleural fluid from dead rabbits, previously inoculated with treponemes, resulted in a similar syndrome (Gudjonsson et al., 1970). Differential filtration of pleural fluid and serum from rabbits revealed an infectious particle size of 25\u201350 nm, which is ether sensitive and inactivated at temperatures of 65\u00b0C or above but not at 56\u00b0C (Gudjonsson et al., 1972, Small et al., 1979; Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983). Sera from rabbits contained pleomorphic virus particles, round or elliptic, 75 to 100 nm in diameter, bearing club-shaped projections 15\u201320 nm long (Small et al., 1979), whereas plasma from rabbits contained high concentrations of pleomorphic viruslike particles measuring 51 to 98 nm in diameter with projections 8\u201313 nm long (Osterhaus et al., 1982). Infectious sera, passed on various cell lines, produced a cytopathic effect in primary rabbit kidney and newborn human intestine cells (Small et al., 1979). However, the cellular pathogenic effect was lost after two passages. Disease was not induced in mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs (Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Small et al., 1979).",

Antisera to the rabbit cardiomyopathy agent cross-reacted with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay (Small and Woods, 1987). Prior incubation of the agent with antisera to CCV, FIPV, TGEV, or 229E virus reduced mortality in rabbits following inoculation. However, prior immunization of rabbits with CCV, FIPV, or TGEV had little effect on survival. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac tissue from diseased rabbits with antisera to 229E virus revealed antigen in myocardial interstitial tissue, and rabbits surviving infection developed antibodies to the virus in a complement fixation assay (Small et al., 1979). In another study, however, surviving rabbits failed to demonstrate antibodies against 229E virus in an enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test, and against OC43 virus in a complement fixation test (Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983).",

By the end of the 1960s, however, mortality had increased to 35\u201340% owing to contamination of treponemal stocks with virus (Jorgensen, 1968; Fennestad, 1985). There is no difference in disease among breeds (Gudjonsson and Skog, 1970) or between rabbits in the United States and Sweden (Gudjonsson et al., 1970). The agent was detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissues from Europe, the United States, and Japan (Fennestad et al., 1980). Nine isolates, obtained from treponema-infected rabbits in various countries, exhibited a wide range in pathogenicity when inoculated into rabbits (Fennestad et al., 1986). Whereas virtually all rabbits had fever, mortality ranged from 0 to 88%, and all surviving rabbits resisted challenge with a virulent strain. Two of four dams from litters inoculated at 6 to 9 days of age became infected, whereas uninoculated littermates or introduced cage-mates failed to develop infection after exposure for several months (Fennestad et al., 1981). Hence, transmission by direct contact occurs rarely.",

Other clinical signs include anorexia, weight loss, atony, tachypnea, and iridocyclitis. With virulent strains, many rabbits die 3 to 5 days after inoculation, although deaths can occur until 14 days (Gudjonsson and Skog, 1970; Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Fennestad et al., 1975, 1986; Fledelius et al., 1978; Small et al., 1979; Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983; Fennestad, 1985; Baric et al., 1990). Generalized or hindquarter muscular weakness was also reported in rabbits surviving the acute phase of infection (Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Small et al., 1979). During the acute phase of infection, rabbits have a transient lymphopenia, followed by heterophilia (Fennestad et al., 1975). Red cell indices were also reduced but returned to normal by 6 weeks after inoculation. There was a transient hypoalbuminemia; however, \u03b3-globulin increased significantly (Fennestad et al., 1975). Serum potassium and lactate dehyrogenase were elevated transiently. Surviving rabbits usually returned to normal in 3 to 4 weeks. Reinoculation of surviving rabbits was without effect, indicating development of resistance to the agent (Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983; Fennestad, 1985; Fennestad et al., 1986).",

The pleural cavities contain 2\u201350 ml of fluid, with or without fibrin, and few cells; ascites may also occur in rabbits dying after the first week. There are subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages. Other findings may include hepatosplenomegaly and congested lymph nodes. The heart weight is increased, and there is dilation of the right ventricle followed by dilation of the left ventricle. The cause of death appears to be congestive heart failure (Small et al., 1979; Baric et al., 1990; Edwards et al., 1992; Alexander et al., 1992, 1993). In fatal cases, there is a uniform reduction of splenic white pulp, focal degenerative changes of the thymus and lymph nodes, and mild proliferative changes of renal glomeruli (Christensen et al., 1978; Small et al., 1979). In rabbits that survive the acute phase, there is multifocal to diffuse myocardial degeneration and necrosis, focal hepatic necrosis, and proliferative changes in the spleen, lymph nodes, interstitial pulmonary tissue, and renal glomeruli. Lesions similar to those in the heart can occur in the diaphragm (Small et al., 1979). A mild nonsuppurative, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis develops during the acute phase of infection and regresses within 4 weeks (Fledelius et al., 1978). At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evidence of right and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et al., 1990). After 2 years, rabbits had pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes and spleen, siderosis in the spleen, necrosis and periportal inflammation in the liver, and interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium (Fennestad et al., 1986). No evidence of circulating or tissue immune complexes was found (Fennestad et al., 1981, 1986).",

Deaths may occur from 2 to 17 days after inoculation, and mortality may exceed 75%. Other major signs include ocular disease, anorexia, weight loss, tachypnea, and atony. The gross and histological lesions are highly characteristic of the disease. Antibodies to the virus cross-react with the human coronavirus 229E and other members of the group I mammalian coronaviruses (FIPV, CCV, and TGEV).",

Rabbits inoculated with virus-contaminated T. pallidum stocks that elicited no or mild disease without mortality were protected from disease when rechallenged with stocks contaminated with more pathogenic virus (Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Fennestad et al., 1980, 1986; Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983; Fennestad, 1985). This indicated that some T. pallidum stocks were contaminated with a nonpathogenic variant of the virus, which was able to confer protection. Furthermore, isolates decreased in pathogenicity, as a function of time, in rabbits that survived acute infection (Fennestad, 1985; Fennestad et al., 1986). Convalescent sera from rabbits that survived infection partially protected challenged rabbits against mortality but not disease (Gudjonsson et al., 1970; Small et al., 1979; Fennestad et al., 1981). Passage of contaminated T. pallidum stocks through hamsters removed the agent responsible for disease (Skovgaard Jensen, 1971; Fennestad et al., 1980). Subsequent reintroduction of these T. pallidum stocks in rabbits was without effect. Similarly, inoculation of rabbits, with popliteal lymph nodes from surviving rabbits, transferred treponemes but not the agent (Gudjonsson et al., 1970).",

Particles obtained from a Percoll gradient appeared as spherical enveloped particles 40\u201350 nm in size with projections of 10\u201312 nm (Descoteaux et al., 1985). In rabbits inoculated orally, pleomorphic particles 60\u201390 nm, with surface projections of 10 nm, were detected in the feces (Osterhaus et al., 1982). Electron microscopy of fecal samples using antisera to rabbit coronavirus revealed immune aggregates of viral particles with morphological features of coronaviruses (Descoteaux et al., 1985). Analysis of structural polypeptides by immunoblotting revealed that antisera to avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) and TGEV detected many of the same epitopes as antisera to the rabbit coronavirus (Descoteaux et al., 1985). Immune sera to 229E, but not AIBV and porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus, inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the rabbit coronavirus. No cytopathic effect occurred following inoculation of various cell lines with fecal samples (LaPierre et al., 1980; Eaton, 1984).",

            "text": "Rabbits with diarrheal disease are usually recently weaned and 3 to 10 weeks old (LaPierre et al., 1980; Eaton, 1984). Because the rabbit coronavirus agglutinates erythrocytes, the hemagglutination activity of the feces provides an indication of the presence of virus (LaPierre et al., 1980). Coronavirus particles can be demonstrated in the feces by electron (LaPierre et al., 1980; Osterhaus et al., 1982; Peeters et al., 1984; Eaton, 1984) and immunoelectron (Descoteaux et al., 1985; Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990) microscopy. The latter technique is more sensitive in detecting virus particles (Descoteaux et al., 1985). At necropsy, the cecal contents are fluid (Eaton, 1984; Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990); histologically, there is intestinal villous atrophy (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990). Adult rabbits may have antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition assay (LaPierre et al., 1980). As experimental inoculation of rabbits with coronavirus failed to mimic the field disease with its high morbidity and mortality, consideration should be given to the existence of copathogens (Osterhaus et al., 1982; Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990). In two studies where other agents were considered, coronavirus was associated with E. coli and Clostridium perfringens infections (Peeters et al., 1984; Eaton, 1984).",

The virus is nonenveloped, spherical, and 28\u201334 nm in diameter and has a buoyant density of 1.32\u20131.38 g/cm3. The icosahedral capsid has 32 cylindrical capsomeres, 5\u20136 nm in diameter. The capsid is comprised of four structural polypeptides: VP1, 60\u201361 kDa; VP2, 54.7 kDa; VP3, 52 kDa; and VP4, 26\u201328 kDa. The virus has been reported to be a picornavirus (Xu and Chen, 1989), calicivirus (Smid et al., 1989; Valicek et al., 1990; Rodak et al., 1990b; Ohlinger et al., 1990; Parra and Prieto, 1990; Ohlinger and Theil, 1991; Liebermann et al., 1992), or parvovirus (Xu et al., 1988; Gregg and House, 1989; House et al., 1990; Du, 1990, 1991; Xu, 1991; Gregg et al., 1991). Hence, the current classification must be considered provisional. Immunoblotting of the virus reveals three major proteins of 38, 52, and 61 kDa, with the latter being dominant (Rodak et al., 1990a; Ohlinger et al., 1990; Parra and Prieto, 1990). Comparison of nucleic acid sequences reveals significant homology with feline calicivirus (Meyers et al., 1991a,b). The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of humans and guinea pigs, but not rabbits.",

Outbreaks of disease have occurred mainly in rabbits 2 months of age and older, whereas younger rabbits were clinically unaffected. Transmission of virus is horizontal, by direct contact with secretions and excretions of infected rabbits. Fecal\u2013oral spread may be the major mode of transmission, but contaminated fomites, including feed, water, utensils, and animal attendants, may also be important modes. There is no evidence of vertical transmission or biological vectors. Experimentally, the routes of entry, in order of importance, are oral, conjunctival, nasal, and skin trauma. In China and Europe, epidemics of disease usually begin in November and end in March. Although O. cuniculus appears to be the only species susceptible to disease, hares in China also appear to be infected and capable of transmitting the disease to rabbits experimentally (Xu, 1991). A serological survey of 1461 rabbits from 43 farms, apparently free of viral hemorrhagic disease, in Czechoslovakia revealed that 283 rabbits (19%) from 33 farms had antibodies (Rodak et al., 1990a). Using another set of sera, collected between 1975 and 1987 from laboratory-maintained rabbits, antibodies were detected in 32 of 42 sera (76%). This suggests that rabbit colonies in Czechoslovakia harbored a viral agent with characteristics similar to those of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, but with lower pathogenicity, several years before the syndrome was recognized in China.",

The incubation period ranges from 1 to 2 days. The morbidity rate is 70\u201380%, and the mortality rate approaches 100%. During outbreaks, the number of rabbits affected usually peaks in 2 to 3 days and lasts 7 to 13 days. After viral introduction, rabbits die suddenly with few clinical signs. Rabbits become febrile and exhibit depression, lethargy, and anorexia. Other clinical signs include tachypnea, cyanosis, abdominal distension, and constipation or diarrhea. Because the disease is acute, clinical signs may be brief and often are unnoticed. In the terminal stage, rabbits become hypothermic, recumbent, and have convulsions and epistaxis. Surviving rabbits exhibit depression, anorexia, and fever which usually abates in 2 to 3 days. In endemic areas, the form of disease observed in surviving rabbits is more common. Hematologic evaluation usually reveals a lymphopenia, a gradual decline in thrombocytes, and prolonged prothrombin and thrombin times. A paracoagulation test with protamine sulfate gives a strong positive reaction. Fibrin degradation products can be detected in most moribund rabbits.",

Small single or multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found in degenerate hepatocytes. There is often little inflammation in necrotic areas. Many tissues, especially the lungs, spleen, and kidneys, may have varying degrees of congestion and hemorrhage due to microinfarction or major venous thrombi. Acute coagulative necrosis due to microinfarction may be found in any organ. Microinfarcts in the brain account for the terminal neurological signs. Pulmonary venous thrombosis accounts for the frothy serosanguinous discharge from the nares seen terminally. A segmental necrotizing enteritis with severe crypt necrosis and villous atrophy similar to that seen with canine or feline parvoviral infections can be found (Gregg et al., 1991).

Cages and equipment can be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite or 1% formalin. Rabbits from areas with the disease should not be introduced directly into the colony but should be quarantined for at least 1 month. Similarly, colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated, since surviving rabbits shed virus for at least a month (Gregg and House, 1989; Gregg et al., 1991). Tissue-derived vaccines, inactivated with formaldehyde (Du et al., 1986; Xu and Chen, 1989; Du, 1990; Huang, 1991) or \u03b2-propiolactone (Smid et al., 1991; Arguello Villares, 1991), have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing disease. Resistance develops within 1 to 2 weeks after vaccination and lasts for 5 to 15 months. Although disease may be prevented in vaccinated rabbits, persistent infection may develop on exposure to the virus (House et al., 1990). Thus, vaccinated rabbits infected with virus should be considered infectious and should not be introduced into previously unexposed rabbitries. Antiserum is also protective (Du, 1990; Huang, 1991).",

The European brown hare virus fails to grow in primary hare and rabbit cell lines (Henriksen et al., 1989; Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991), and inoculation of mice and guinea pigs failed to induce disease (Henriksen et al., 1989). Inoculation of liver homogenates from affected hares into rabbits resulted in a clinical syndrome similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Tissues from inoculated rabbits exhibited hemagglutination with human type O erythrocytes, and similar viral particles were detected by electron microscopy. Antiserum against rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus protected rabbits from mortality, and surviving rabbits had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition assay (Morisse et al., 1990). However, other investigators have failed to induce disease in rabbits with the European brown hare virus (Ohlinger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci et al., 1991).",

In France, Germany, and Italy, the geographic distribution of European brown hare syndrome coincides with viral hemorrhagic disease in wild and domesticated rabbits (Morisse et al., 1991; Loliger and Eskens, 1991;\nCancellotti and Renzi, 1991). Although systematic studies of the prevalence of infection have not been conducted, sera from most hares contain antibodies to the virus (Capucci et al., 1991; Marcato et al., 1991). Young hares are resistant to the virus (Morisse et al., 1991). The major mode of transmission appears to be fecal\u2013oral spread (Morisse et al., 1991). Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission (Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991). Among wild and farmed hares in Denmark and Sweden, mortality is seasonal, beginning in October and continuing through March (Henriksen et al., 1989; Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991). In England, excessive mortality in wild hares was reported in September through November (Chasey and Duff, 1990).",

Gross examination of hares reveals marked pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as hepatic congestion and hemorrhages. Moderate splenomegaly and gastric ulceration are detected in some hares. A catarrhal to necrotizing conjunctivitis may be present. Microscopically, there is diffuse acute coagulation necrosis of hepatic periportal and midzonal areas, accompanied by formation of acidophilic bodies (Henriksen et al., 1989; Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991). In many hares, there is basophilic stippling in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in periportal areas, representing granular calcification. Many livers have microvacuolar fatty degeneration. About one-fourth of affected hares have splenic cellular depletion and hyaline-like changes in the sinuses and cords, and about one-third have renal tubular necrosis and calcification. In the brain, cerebral neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit granulovacuolar degeneration. In apparently healthy hares with antibodies to the virus, hepatic vacuolar degeneration, tracheitis, and hyperplasia of splenic follicles are observed (Marcato et al., 1991).",

Ito et al. (1987) also detected antibodies to Sendai virus in rabbit sera in studies comparing antigenic relationships among paramyxoviruses. Intranasal inoculation of O. cuniculus with Sendai virus resulted in infection; rabbits shed virus for 3 to 7 days after inoculation, and viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the nasal cavities (Machii et al., 1989). Although rabbits showed no clinical signs and had only a moderate increase of goblet cells in the nasal epithelium, antibodies to the virus developed. One of three uninoculated rabbits exposed to inoculated rabbits acquired infection.
