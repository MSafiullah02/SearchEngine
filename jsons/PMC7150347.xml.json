            "text": "Pneumonia, a respiratory infection of the alveolar space, can vary from a mild outpatient illness to a severe illness necessitating hospitalization and intensive care. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases. When the infection occurs in patients who are living in the community it is termed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), while it is called nosocomial pneumonia if it arises in patients who are already in the hospital. Presently, the distinction between community-acquired and nosocomial infection is less clear because the \u2018community\u2019 includes complex patients such as those who have recently been hospitalized, those in nursing homes, and those with chronic diseases who are commonly managed in such facilities as dialysis centers or nursing homes. When this latter group develops pneumonia, it has been termed healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and this illness shares clinical features with CAP, but the etiologic pathogens may overlap with those seen in more traditional nosocomial pneumonia. Thus, the relationship between bacteriology and the site of origin of infection is a reflection of several factors, including: the types of patients who develop the illness, their host defense related predisposition to infection with specific pathogens, and their environmental exposure to certain organisms. This discussion focuses on pneumonia arising out of the hospital in immune-competent individuals, but excludes discussion of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or traditional immune suppression (cancer chemotherapy, immune suppressive medications).",

Although the majority of cases of CAP are managed in the outpatient setting, the greater part of the cost of treatment is focused on hospitalized patients. Those who are admitted to the hospital commonly tend to be older and have a high frequency of comorbid illness. In the US, the population of elderly patients is increasing, and those aged over 65 make up about one-third of all CAP patients, but this group accounts for more than half of the cost because of the frequent need for elderly CAP patients to be hospitalized.",

Pneumonia can also occur in patients who have an adequate immune system, if the host defense system is overwhelmed by a large inoculum of microorganisms, which can occur in a patient with massive aspiration of gastric contents.

            "text": "Keeping these concepts in mind, it is easy to understand why previously healthy individuals develop infection with virulent pathogens such as viruses, L. pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae. On the other hand, chronically ill patients can be infected by these organisms, as well as by organisms that commonly colonize patients, but only cause infection when immune responses are inadequate. These organisms include enteric Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and fungi. Recent studies have evaluated the normal lung immune response to infection and have shown that it is generally \u2018compartmentalized\u2019, and thus most patients with unilateral pneumonia have an inflammatory response that is limited to the site of infection, not spilling over to the uninvolved lung or to the systemic circulation. In patients with localized pneumonia, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8) levels were increased in the pneumonic lung and generally not increased in the uninvolved lung or in the serum. In patients with severe pneumonia, the immune response is characterized by a spillover of the immune response into the systemic circulation, reflected by increases in serum levels of TNF and IL-6. It remains uncertain why localization does not occur in all individuals, and why some patients develop diffuse lung injury (acute respiratory distress sydrome, ARDS) or systemic sepsis as a consequence of pneumonia. Recent studies have suggested that genetic polymorphisms may explain some of these differences, with patients who have certain inherited patterns of immune response being more prone than others to severe forms of pneumonia, and even mortality from this illness. For example, certain genetic polymorphisms are associated with a greater risk of death from sepsis but not CAP. Specifically, TNF-308 polymorphisms increase sepsis mortality, but not mortality from CAP. In addition, CAP severity is increased with genetic changes in the IL-10\u20131082 locus, which are often present along with changes in the TNF-308 locus. Another genetic change associated with an increased risk of septic shock from CAP is a modification in heat shock protein 70-2. Currently, we are aware of the large number of genes that can affect the severity and outcome of CAP, but much more must be learned to put these findings into a true clinical context.",

Hemophilus influenzae is a common organism in patients who smoke cigarettes, and in those with chronic obstructive lung disease.

Patients with severe CAP may have a slightly different spectrum of organisms than less severely affected individuals, being commonly infected with pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, enteric Gram-negatives (including P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus aureus, and H. influenzae. The modifying factors that increase the risk of infection with DRSP are: age over 65 years, beta-lactam therapy within the past 3 months, alcoholism, immune suppressive illness (including therapy with corticosteroids), multiple medical comorbidities, and exposure to a child in a day care setting. The modifying factors for enteric Gram-negatives include: residence in a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy.

Infection is most common in the winter and early spring, which may relate to the finding that up to 70% of patients have a preceding viral illness. The organism spreads from person to person, and commonly colonizes the oropharynx before it leads to pneumonia. Pneumonia develops when colonizing organisms are aspirated into a lung that is unable to contain the aspirated inoculum. Infection is more common in the elderly; those with asplenia, multiple myeloma, congestive heart failure, or alcoholism; after influenza; and in patients with chronic lung disease. In patients with HIV infection, pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteremia is more common than in healthy populations of the same age.

Fortunately, in the US, a large number of penicillin-resistant organisms are of the intermediate type (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, of 0.1\u20131.0 mg l\u22121) and not of the high-level type (penicillin MIC of 2.0 mg l\u22121 or more).

More recently, some studies have shown that resistance can affect outcome. In a group of patients with pneumococcal bacteremia, of which more than half were HIV-positive, high-level resistance was a predictor of mortality. Other investigators did not find an increased risk of death from infection with resistant organisms, but did find an enhanced likelihood of suppurative complications (empyema), and a more prolonged length of stay in hospital. These conflicting data may have been the result of studying relatively few patients, many of whom did not have high levels of in vitro resistance. One large study evaluated more than 5000 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia and CAP and found an increased mortality for patients with a penicillin MIC of at least 4 mg l\u22121 or greater, or with a cefotaxime MIC of 2.0 mg l\u22121 or more. However, this increased mortality was only present if patients who died in the first 4 days of therapy were excluded from analysis. Fortunately, very few organisms are currently at this level of resistance, which may explain the conflicting findings in various studies. More recently, another study using both a cohort and matched control methods found that severity of illness, and not resistance or accuracy of therapy, was the most important predictor of mortality. In some studies, severity of illness was greater in patients without resistant organisms, implying a loss of virulence among organisms that become resistant, a finding echoed in other studies that have found that the absence of invasive illness is a risk factor for pneumoccal resistance.",

However, it is important to understand that most macrolide resistance in the US is low level, and due to an efflux mechanism, and thus it is a type of resistance that may not be clinically relevant, because local concentrations of macrolides at respiratory sites of infection may be adequate for effective therapy. However, some resistance is higher level and due to an inability of the antibiotic to bind to its ribosomal site of action, and this form of resistance may be much higher level and more likely to be clinically relevant. There are however, very few reports of macrolide failures in CAP, especially considering the widespread use of these agents.

The two best-studied and widely regarded prediction rules for pneumonia severity are the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and the CURB-65 rule, a modification of a prognostic model developed by the British Thoracic Society. The PSI uses a number of demographic and historical findings, physical findings, and laboratory data to assign a score to each patient, and the score is used to categorize patients into one of five classes, each with a different risk of death. This tool has worked very well to define mortality risk, but has had variable success in predicting need for admission, is cumbersome to use, and does not discriminate very well among the most severely ill patients. The CURB-65 rule is simpler, using only five assessments: c\u00afonfusion, u\u00afrea>7mmoll\u22121, r\u00afespiratoryrate\u226530min\u22121, b\u00afloodpressure<90mmHg systolic or \u226460 mm diastolic, and age \u226565 years. Each of the five criteria is scored and as the score rises from 0 to 5, mortality risk rises. In recent studies, both tools have worked equally well to identify patients at low risk of dying, but the CURB-65 has been more discriminating in recognizing patients who need ICU care (score of at least 3) and who have the highest risk of death. A major difference between the two models is that the PSI weights advanced age and chronic illness very heavily, while the CURB-65 model includes age as only one of several risk factors, and comorbid illness is not measured, but instead most of the score is based on acute physiologic abnormalities. None of the prediction models includes social factors in the scoring system, and clearly these issues need to be included in patient assessment, paying attention to whether the patient has a stable home environment for outpatient care, an ability to take oral medications, the absence of acute alcohol or drug intoxication, and stability of other acute and chronic medical problems.",

The role of Gram's stain in focusing initial antibiotic therapy is uncertain since the accuracy of the test to predict the culture recovery of an organism such as pneumococcus depends on the criteria used. Investigators have shown the practical limitations of the test, because fewer than half of all patients can even produce a sputum sample, only about half of these are valid, and very few are diagnostic, and thus it is uncommon to choose an antibiotic directed to the diagnostic result.

There are differences among the available agents in their intrinsic activity against pneumococcus, and, based on MIC data, these agents can be ranked from most to least active as: gemifloxacin (available only in oral form), moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Some data suggest a lower likelihood of both clinical failures and the induction of pneumoccal resistance to quinolones, if the more active agents are used in place of the less active agents.",

These include the need for timely administration of initial antibiotic therapy, the limited use of therapy directed at methicillin-resistant S. aureus, the need for routine atypical pathogen coverage for all patients, and the emphasis on using highly active agents in all patients with risk factors for infection with DRSP. The reason for this last recommendation is because if a patient is at risk for infection with DRSP, use of a highly active agent is not only likely to minimize the risk of treatment failure, but may also rapidly and reliably eradicate pneumococcal organisms that have low levels of resistance, so that there is less selection pressure for emergence of organisms with high level of resistance.",
