Although IBV is mainly considered a respiratory infection, other clinical manifestations including renal, enteric and reproductive signs can also be observed and therefore, economic losses due to low performance and mortality because of secondary infections are experienced (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; OIE, 2004) . The causative virus agent of IB (IBV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . The virus isolates present a high antigenic and immunogenic diversity as was revealed early after its first identification (Hofstad, 1958) . Since then, newly emergent isolates that differ not only in antigenic properties but also in tissue tropism and pathogenicity are continuously being reported all over the world (Gelb et al., 1991; OIE, 2004; Shaw et al., 1996; Zanella et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 436, "text": "(Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 437, "end": 447, "text": "OIE, 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 528, "end": 553, "text": "(Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 679, "end": 694, "text": "(Hofstad, 1958)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 874, "end": 893, "text": "(Gelb et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 894, "end": 904, "text": "OIE, 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 905, "end": 923, "text": "Shaw et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 924, "end": 945, "text": "Zanella et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Use of molecular techniques in epidemiological surveys, particularly reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gene sequencing, have widely contributed to faster identification of new emergent IBV isolates.

Even when after its first report, this serotype turned to be one of the predominant genotypes in several European countries, including Spain (Dolz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2005; Worthington and Jones, 2006; Worthington et al., 2004) . Recently in some of these countries the number of isolations of Italy 02 strains has decreased during the last years, but it has not been the case of Spain where it still remains the predominant genotype (Dolz et al., 2009) . However, despite the epidemiologic relevance acquired, very few data is available regarding in vivo pathologic traits of Italy 02 serotype strains. Italy 02 viruses have been isolated mostly from broiler flocks that experienced respiratory signs, and also from adult birds, broiler breeders and layers, associated with drop in egg production (Worthington et al., 2004) . However, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and exact pathogenesis of this novel serotype remain unknown and even the pathogenic ability of this serotype is questioned. IBV pathogenesis was deeply investigated in 1970s and 1980s, most of these studies relying on the use of virus isolation, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical techniques (Albassam et al., 1986; Alexander and Gough, 1978; Cook, 1968 Cook, , 1971 Crinion et al., 1971; Chen et al., 1996; Chong and Apostolov, 1982; Hofstad and Yoder, 1966; Jordan, 1970, 1971; McMartin, 1968; Nakamura et al., 1991; Owen et al., 1991) . With the advancement of molecular techniques, antigen detection sensibilities greatly improved. However, these techniques have been rarely implemented in IBV pathogenesis investigations despite the extensive use in epidemiological studies (Kapczynski et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002) . Therefore, the application of molecular techniques in pathogenesis studies could greatly improve the current knowledge in IBV infection and tissue distribution. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathogenic traits of Italy 02 IBV serotype in young chickens and adult laying hens.

Our data indicate that Italy 02 virus is able to cause gross and microscopic lesions in kidney of dayold chicks. Furthermore, viral nucleic acid was detected in epithelial tubular renal cells and ureters by ISH, which correlated with the detection of IBV genome by RT-PCR. Thereby, there is no doubt that Italy 02 can induce renal disease in young chickens. However, contradictory results were obtained regarding virus detection in kidney of adult hens: slight microscopic lesions were observed and IBV genome was consistently detected by RT-PCR, but no evidences of viral detection by ISH was observed. Although it is possible that RT-PCR might detect virus nucleic acid that was not actively replicating in renal tissue but was circulating in bloodstream, viraemia periods reported for IBV are mostly short and thereby it would be inconsistent with such a persistent detection (Chong and Apostolov, 1982; Raj and Jones, 1997) . On the other hand, some controversial findings, as isolation of IBV from kidney tissue in absence of renal disease, lesions or viral replication evidenced by other techniques, have also been previously reported in adult birds, by other authors (Ignjatovic et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004) . These different findings could be due to IBV strain differences. Most enveloped viruses do not have the ability to infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because viral envelopes are susceptible to dissociation by enzymes, bile salts and pH values present in GI. However, coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which can withstand the harsh conditions in the GI tract (Flint et al., 2000) . In the present study we have confirmed this statement, by detecting IBV in enterocytes from caecal tonsil, ileum and rectum. Despite very extensive virus replication was evidenced in caecal tonsil, ileum and rectum, it could not be confirmed by ISH in duodenum or proventriculus. These observations are supported by other studies in which; although IBV was isolated from proventriculus and duodenum, replication was not observed in these regions (Raj and Jones, 1996) . Both, changes in cell receptors and adverse luminal content conditions, can alter virus infectivity and replication extent within GI tract regions. Moreover, it is well established that in birds, the lower intestine moves uric acid into proximal regions of the colon and caeca through retrograde peristalsis (Laverty et al., 2006) . Our results showed that IBV genome can be evidenced in kidney as early as day 1 PI, and we detected positivity by ISH, not only in epithelial tubular cells, but also in epithelial cells of ureters. Thus, IBV is likely to be shed in uric acid, which on the other hand, could reach upper gut regions by retroperistaltic movement. It is therefore possible that this physiological feature may contribute to the successful and persistent establishment of IBV replication in lower GI tract regions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 160, "text": "(Albassam et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 161, "end": 179, "text": "Ignjatovic et al.,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1275, "text": "Lee et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2184, "text": "(Chong and Apostolov, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2205, "text": "Raj and Jones, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2477, "text": "(Ignjatovic et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2495, "text": "Lee et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2862, "end": 2882, "text": "(Flint et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3331, "end": 3352, "text": "(Raj and Jones, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3663, "end": 3685, "text": "(Laverty et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Aerosols are considered the main route of horizontal transmission of IBV within an infected flock and respiratory droplets are assumed as the main source of virus.

In the present study, both routes of viral shedding were investigated by RT-PCR detection in nasal and cloacal swabs in day-old chicks and adult SPF hens and surprisingly, virus shedding in faeces was detected more consistently and for longer periods (up to the end of the experiment) than in nasal discharge. These observations have clear practical consequences in both disease diagnosis and control. On one hand, based in our results, cloacal swab samples would improve virus detection and therefore rapid diagnosis of the disease even in the acute stage of the disease. On the other hand, our results indicate that faeces are likely to be a major source of virus for susceptible birds and would greatly contribute to IBV transmission among animals and probably also among farms.

More surprisingly, one hen at the end of the experiment showed clear degenerative changes of epithelial cells lining glandular tissue on magnum which were associated to widespread viral nucleic acid detection in epithelial cells evidenced by ISH. Thus, it is likely that Italy 02 can barely replicate in the oviduct of adult hens. Our results are in concordance with those reported previously suggesting that the alteration in the oviduct may contribute to diminished egg production (Cavanagh, 2003) . Taking into account that viral replication periods reported for IBV in oviduct reach no further than 9 days PI (Jones and Jordan, 1971) , it seems unlikely that IBV would have not replicated in epithelial cells of the oviduct prior to day 19 PI in our experiment. It appears more probably that IBV had been replicating, in some birds, at lower rates in the oviduct, which would be supported by inflammatory microscopic changes found in those birds.
