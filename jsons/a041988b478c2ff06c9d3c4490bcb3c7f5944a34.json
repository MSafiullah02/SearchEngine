The numbers of reported cases continue to rise and threaten global health. Transmissions among family members are frequently observed, although the route of transmission is partially known. Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family. Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection. Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings. Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/ moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.",

Since the first cluster of atypical pneumonia cases was reported on 31 December 2019, 1 the disease has spread with surprising speed. While much attention has been focused on viral transmission dynamics and the spectrum of clinical illness, these aspects are not yet completely understood. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] This report describes the epidemiological and clinical features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among three members of a family following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Owing to the unavailability of effective vaccines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, most preventive measures aim to reduce the risk of infection. 9 Despite several recommended drugs, including the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir and interferon-beta-1b, effective treatment options are scarce. 2 Hence, prevention of infection is of utmost importance. We provide evidence to support the increasing concerns regarding person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
