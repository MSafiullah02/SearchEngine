The average incubation period is 5 days, but ranges from 1\u201314 days. Most patients present with mild respiratory tract infection, mostly commonly characterised by fever (82%) and cough (81%). Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been described in 14% of the reported cases, and the overall mortality is around 2% [2].

Current therapeutic approaches include aggressive standard supportive care and treatment of any other co-infections. Anti-viral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, or lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and interferon beta-1 are under investigation but safety and potential efficacy remains to be determined. Remdesivir and interferon beta-1\u03b2 appear to have superior antiviral activity to lopinavir and remdesivir in vitro for the MERS coronavirus but whether this is the case for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined [2]. The FDA has recently approved use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients but the efficacy remains to be determined. Growing information also suggests that virus-induced cytokine storm in the lungs may drive severe pathogenesis and provide potential therapeutic targets, for example anti-IL6 or anti-IL-1 approaches [3].",

As these encompass a wide range of approaches and targeted patient groups, it is imperative to better understand the rationale and the potential mechanisms of MSC actions towards respiratory viral infections. Recent pre-clinical data in models of respiratory virus infections and relevant related clinical studies of MSC administration in patients with ARDS can contribute to better define the patient population towards whom potential MSC-based cell therapy approaches might be considered.",

            "text": "Following systemic administration, the majority of MSCs lodge in the pulmonary vascular bed through as yet unclear interactions with the capillary endothelial cells. Tracking studies using labeled MSCs demonstrate the most are cleared within 24\u201348 h although there can be longer persistence in injured or inflamed lungs [4]. The clearance mechanisms are still being elucidated but include apoptosis and subsequent effereocytosis and phagocytosis by resident inflammatory and immune cells, notably macrophages [5]. While lodged in the lungs, the MSCs are able to release a wide variety of soluble mediators including anti-inflammatory cytokines [6], antimicrobial peptides [7], angiogenic growth factors, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) (fig. 1) [8]. Direct cell-cell transmission of mitochondria from MSCs to respiratory epithelial and immune cells [9] has also been described [10]. A growing literature demonstrates that the pattern of anti-inflammatory mediators released is specific for the inflammatory lung environment encountered and is mediated through differential activation of damage and pathogen-associated molecular pathogen receptors expressed on MSC cell surfaces [11]. This includes toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are activated by viral RNA (TLR3) (as in COVID-19) and viral unmethylated CpG-DNA (TLR9), leading to downstream cell signaling pathways resulting in MSC activation [12]. MSC-secreted angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) contribute to the restoration of alveolar-capillary barriers disrupted as part of ARDS pathogenesis [13] while specific inhibitory mRNAs (miRNAs) in EVs are also described as mediating the protective effects of MSCs in pre-clinical models of bacterial or non-infectious acute lung injuries [14]. However, mediators responsible for ameliorating respiratory viral-induced lung injuries remain unclear. In animal models, H9N2 viral infection increases serum and lung chemokines responsible for lung leukocyte infiltration, including Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1\u03b1) and others that are markedly reduced by intravenous administration of MSCs [15]. Increased levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), typical of anti-viral immune responses, alone or together with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, prompt MSC activation including the release of anti-inflammatory mediators. The importance of such IFN \u201clicensing\u201d of immuno modulating effects has been previously demonstrated in a model of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), where the MSC treated recipients of IFN (\u2212/\u2212) T cell grafts, did not respond to cell therapy, evolving into fatal GVHD [16]. Unpublished data from COVID-19 patients in Italy suggest that high levels of IFN-\u03b3 are found and thus may influence systemically administered MSCs (Massimo Dominici, personal communication). However, \u201clicensed\u201d MSCs can also suppress alloantigen-induced T cell functions in vitro, potentially compromising antiviral responses needed for disease control. For example, MSCs suppress lymphocyte proliferation in response to the activation of influenza-specific T cells in vitro [17]. Umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have also been shown to inhibit the cytotoxicity of specific T cells against H1N1 influenza virus in vitro [18], leading perhaps to prolonged infection in recipients. This is in contrast to reports where, for example, in models of CMV infection, MSCs exert differential effects on alloantigen and virus specific T cells that retain the ability to proliferate, produce IFN-\u03b3, and to kill CMV-infected cells in vitro [19].",

Among these antiviral proteins, members of the IFITM family members are unique as they prevent infection before a virus can traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell. These activities limit infection in cultured cells by many viruses, including dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus [22]. Silencing of one of the most highly expressed ISGs in MSCs (p21/CDKN1A), specifically increased their susceptibility to chikungunya virus (CHIKV), whereas knockdown of IFITM3 rendered MSC susceptible to infection by a variety of viruses including YFV and ZIKV [21].",

This can occur rapidly following exposure of uninfected MSCs [23] and virus-infected MSCs may thus not be functionally effective at stopping virus replication and lung inflammation [24\u201327]. BM-MSCs express influenza virus alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors on their cell surfaces and can support replication of both avian H1N1 and H9N5 influenza strains [24, 25]. Influenza-infected MSCs undergo cell lysis apoptosis within 18 h post -exposure, with corresponding production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [24] potentially subverting their protective immunomodulatory properties [26]. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also infect MSCs modifying immune cell proliferation and activity [27]. As such, depending on the virus type and the level of expression or percentage of MSCs expressing the virus receptor, MSCs may get infected if infused into a patient with an ongoing respiratory virus infection. How this would affect potential beneficial effects remains to be determined.",

ACE2 is highly expressed in respiratory epithelial cells thus playing a crucial role in the entry of virus into these cells [29]. ACE2 was recently also demonstrated to be an ISG in nasal epithelial cells [30]. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 may exploit IFN-driven upregulation of ACE2, a key tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection. Conversely, ACE2 was reported to protect against non-viral lung injury by degrading the profibrotic peptide angiotensin (Ang) II [31]. In vivo gene silencing of ACE2 enhances bleomycin-induced lung collagen deposition in mice, whereas systemic administration of purified ACE2 inhibits the fibrotic response [32]. Murine BM-MSCs over-expressing the ACE2 gene following lentiviral vector transduction, offered additional anti-inflammatory and endothelial-protective effects against endotoxin-induced lung injury in mice [33, 34], However, there may be a downside to this if ACE2 over-expression results in infection and subsequent deleterious effects on the MSCs. As the level of gene expression is a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility [28], it is relevant to assess whether MSCs of any origin constitutively or inducibly express ACE2 or TMPRSS2.",

These have further been limited to influenza viruses, have produced conflicting results, and have not as yet directly addressed coronavirus respiratory infections (table 1). Notably two earlier studies found MSCs not to be protective against influenza respiratory infections in mice. Darwish and colleagues assessed the effects of a single systemic administration in immunocompetent mice of either syngeneic murine bone marrow-derived MSCs or xenogeneic human bone marrow-derived MSCs on lung injury induced by mouse-adapted H1N1 or swine-origin pandemic H1N1 [37]. Two different doses of MSCs (2.5 or 5\u00d7105 cells/mouse) were administered at different time points after virus administration: Day \u22122, 0, 2 and 5 post-infection (p.i.). Using survival and different measures of lung inflammation as outcome endpoints on day 7 p.i., neither syngeneic or xenogeneic MSC administration, either alone or as an adjuvant therapy with oseltamivir, was effective either when administered prophylactically, prior to virus inoculation, or when therapeutically administered. Similarly, Gotts and colleagues assessed the effect of both systemic and intratracheal administration of human and mouse MSCs (5\u00d7105 cells/mouse), administered in two doses, either earlier (day 2 and 3 p.i.) or later (day 5 and 6 p.i.), in mouse adapted H1N1-induced lung injury in immunocompetent mice [38].

Systemic administration of 5\u00d7105 human bone-marrow derived MSCs/mouse on day 5 p.i. in aged (8\u201312 months) immunocompetent mice infected with Influenza A (H5N1) [39] reduced virus-induced mortality (until day 18 p.i.), weight loss (day 6\u201310 p.i.), lung edema (day 7 p.i.), BALF CD4+ T and natural killer (NK) cells (day 7 p.i.), lung histopathological lesions (day 18 p.i.), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (day 7 p.i.) without reducing lung virus titers (day 7 and 10 p.i.). They further found that Ang-1 and KGF released by MSCs were important, but not enough to attenuate the effects of viral infection on alveolar fluid clearance and permeability. However, in young (6\u20138 weeks) mice, no effects were observed in mortality and body weight loss. Thus, the data suggests that systemic MSC administration may provide benefit in older patients who are at higher risk for severe pulmonary illness caused by H5N1.

A single intravenous administration led on day 3 p.i. to reduction in mortality, lung edema, histologic injury, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum chemokines and cytokines, as well as improving gas-exchange and levels of anti-inflammatory mediators, although not reducing lung virus titration when administered either 30 min or 24 h after infection induction. Differences between early and later administration of MSCs were only observed in some BALF and serum inflammatory mediators. Only early administration reduced BALF monokine induced by interferon-\u03b3 (MIG), GM-CSF; BALF and serum interleukin 1-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3; and increased levels of BALF and serum IL-10. Both early and later administration led to reduction of BALF and serum IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. This might reflect that early administration seems more geared towards prevention of cell infection and inflammation, rather than dealing with more clinically relevant sequelae of epithelial infection. Avian influenza virus infection can trigger a very intense pro-inflammatory response compared to other influenza viruses; thus, authors speculated that the beneficial effects might be a specific consequence of different pathogenic features as compared to swine origin H1N1 infection [15].",

While this model requires further evaluation it might facilitate the testing of therapeutics including cell-based therapies for COVID-19. Recently, a non-human primate model for SARS-CoV-2 was able to reflect the same clinical signs, viral replication, and pathology observed in humans with comparable levels of mortality and might be a valuable model for further evaluation [46].",

In this study, 17 critically-ill patients with H7N9-induced ARDS received multiple IV administrations of menstrual blood-derived cells (106 cells/infusion in Plasmalyte) obtained from a single healthy donor and outcomes were compared to 44 comparably critically ill patients receiving standard antiviral and supportive therapies.

However, no information is provided concerning the timing between infusions or whether the control patients received vehicle infusions. The MSC-treated and control patients were otherwise fairly well matched for comorbidities and degrees of multi-organ failure and use of other supportive therapies except for a higher incidence of shock in the MSC-treated group (p<0.03). No apparent infusional toxicities or serious adverse events were noted. 3 patients in the MSC-treated group died (82.4% survival) whereas 24 in the control died (45.5% survival). However, no details on the deaths, including cause and timing related to either infusion or to overall clinical course, or on other standard assessments including ventilator-free days, ICU stay, or hospital stay, were provided. Complete blood count and measures of renal, liver, cardiac, and coagulation functions were comparable except for a higher circulating pro-calcitonin level in the control group, perhaps suggestive of secondary or co-bacterial infections although no information on other infections was provided. The authors concluded that MSC administration is a viable approach for H7N9-induced ARDS and that this could be potentially applicable to use in COVID-19 patients.",

There are three main interventions: MSCs (n=17, 781patients), MSC derivatives (CM, EVs, n=4, 176 patients), or other cell sources (n=6, 330 patients). General common features of the investigations include a) systemic administration, jointly or followed by the recommended conventional supportive treatments for severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection; [49] b) age range 18\u201380 years old with no gender restrictions; c) follow up for at least three months; and d) clinical samples collected will be throat secretions and/or blood. For the MSC investigations, 9/17 will utilise UC-MSCs, 1/17 will utilise menstrual blood-origin MSCs, and 6/17 do not disclose the MSC tissue source. Notably, no apparent MSCs of bone marrow origin are being utilised despite the majority of pre-clinical investigations for non-viral induced acute lung injuries having utilised BM-MSCs. There was little clarification of use of cryopreserved versus continuously cultured cells [5]. Only 6/16 disclosed the intended cell injection dose, among which only 4 were correlated with the patient body weight. The intravenous dosing range varies between 0.4 and 42\u00d7106 cells\u00b7/kg\u22121. In comparison, the highest dose of MSCs used in the published literature for clinical trials in non-viral ARDS was 10\u00d7106 cells\u00b7kg\u22121 (START trial) [50]. The dosing strategy ranged between a single and 5 doses with an average frequency of every 2 days.\n",

Critically ill patients with ARDS requiring supportive measures including intubation and mechanical ventilation are a logical population. Appreciating that there are other potential therapeutic approaches being considered in this population, it would seem reasonable to target these patients as soon as possible following intubation and mechanical ventilation. Arguments can be made as well for severely infected patients with currently recognised risk factors such as increased age, diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease at potentially higher risk for clinical deterioration. In this instances, emerging data on clinical and laboratory indications, such as level of oxygenation, changes in oxygenation, and elevations in indicators of systemic cytokine storm may be criteria for initiating MSC administration. As these indictors are evolving, we advocate a broad minded approach for considering when to consider MSC use. Whether moderate or mild disease patients should be part of clinical investigation remains less clear. The available pre-clinical data and the safety data from clinical trials in non-viral ARDS best supports potential use. As it is too early to tell whether there will be any downstream respiratory effects in COVID-19 ARDS survivors, this seems a less urgent population to target. Similarly, targeting recovering mild or moderately affected patients to counter as yet unknown downstream effects on the lungs also seems to be a less urgent consideration. Overall, to date there has been a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which currently hinders the development of an optimal study design",
