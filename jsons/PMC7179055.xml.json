During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, unprecedented numbers of patients require sedation in intensive care units (ICUs) and other hospital locations due to their ventilator dependence. However, pharmacologic sedation in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 has thus far received very little attention in the critical care literature, with minimal mention in the Society of Critical Care Medicine\u2019s COVID-19 guidelines or clinical reviews.1,2 We propose that sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 poses unique challenges and has multiple important implications that we would like to briefly outline:",

These high sedation requirements are likely related to younger age and good health of many patients before the onset of COVID-19, high respiratory drive, and intense inflammatory responses previously linked to tolerance.3 This translates into the need to administer combinations of multiple agents (eg, propofol, ketamine, hydromorphone, dexmedetomidine, andmidazolam), increasing potential risks of side effects (eg, QT interval prolongation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypotension, anddelirium) and requiring vigilance of the ICU staff. When these are administered in combinations, the typical requirements to ensure patient comfort and ventilator synchrony in adult patients range between 25 and 50 \u00b5g/kg/min for propofol, 10 and 20 \u00b5g/kg/min for ketamine, 2 and4 mg/h for hydromorphone, and 2 and5 mg/h for midazolam. There are currently no sedation guidelines specific for this patient population requiring high doses and prolonged drug administrations.",
