virus. To date, most of the confirmed cases in Africa 100 are imported. Whether community transmission has started and the extent is not known, 101 hence the limitation of the continued use of travel history. Evidence has now shown cases 102 without travel history to China being detected in some developing countries 22 . 103 104 There are possible explanations of why the country might not be testing as many suspects as 105 possible. The main possible reason should the unavailability of the COVID-19 diagnostic 106 tests. The actual number of COVID-19 tests available in the country is not open to the public. 107 However, reports of donations from development partners without specifying the exact 108 amounts have been made 12 . The other reasons might be due to the weak screening 109 procedures at the ports of entry; poor adherence, incorrect interpretation or use of the 110 WHO screening criteria and complexed of COVID-19 testing. Currently, there are no studies 111 that have been conducted to validate the WHO screening criteria. The use of the word \"test\" 112 might be misleading considering the several complex steps (many of them manual) involved 113 in COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 testing to date involves Reverse Transcription Polymerase 114 Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technology 23 . The process has to be done by a qualified laboratory 115 scientist or technician, and at each step, quality control protocols are followed to ensure an 116 accurate and precise result. Like any other developing countries, Zimbabwe is not spared 117 from the shortage of diagnostic equipment and the required skilled personal. invested significantly in the capacitating of the diagnostic laboratories and 121 isolation centres in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Microbiology 122 Reference Laboratory (NMRL), capacity to test for COVID-19 and sub-national laboratories in 123 efficient specimen collection, handling, and processing was assessed and found to be 124 satisfactory. A system to sent specimens to South Africa for confirmation was established. 125 One of the suspected cases had a sample successfully sent to South Africa verification. The 126 country established three major isolation centres in Harare at WIDH, Bulawayo at 127 Thorngroove Hospital and the tourist town of Victoria Falls at Victoria Falls Hospital. In 128 terms of the necessary equipment and infrastructure, the most developed and supported is 129 the one at WIDH. All the isolation have challenges of intensive and critical care unit beds in 130 case of severe complications. None of the centres has a functioning ventilator. Infection 131 control has been a challenge at these isolation centres due to shortages of personal 132 protective equipment(PPE) 24 . Reports of them initially relying on space suits, gloves, 133 gumboots and N95 respirators acquired when the country was preparing to fight an Ebola 134 outbreak in 2014 were made but these quickly ran out. Development partners have also 135 donated some, but shortages continue to be experienced 24 . Although there is a lack of PPE, 136 infection prevention and control protocols have been developed across the cascade of 137 COVID-19 care in line with WHO guidance 25,26 . On top of the isolation centres, COVID-19 138 Rapid Response Teams have been set up at all levels throughout the country. Each of the ten 139 provinces has a COVID-19 Rapid Response Team responsible for first-line follow-up and 140 tracking of suspect cases and organising the necessary referral to the isolation centres. 141 These teams have been very responsive, as reflected by how they responded to the has been conducted among health workers at all levels in the different 145 regions of the country in the case management of COVID-19. The skills were further 146 enhanced with the experience gained from the suspected cases. However, three of the 147 cases who experienced mental illness and stigma (which might have led to the other patient 148 abscond testing and the other being reported by the hotel despite being asymptomatic) 149 indicate that these social, psychological, and mental consequences of COVID-19 should be 150 considered as part of case management. Research conducted in China has shown the 151 psychological impact associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19, notably the isolation and 152 quarantine 27 . Several incidents of Chinese nationals being stigmatised and discriminated in 153 other countries just because the virus originated in China have been reported 28 . 154 155 The patient who developed mental illness reported to a public health facility while she was 156 still under the 21-day follow-up, thereby posing the risk of infection to the other patients 157 and health care workers. Available evidence has shown that patients with an initial negative 158 result can later test positive 29 . This mistake brings into doubt whether the authorities are 159 earnestly following-up all patients under self-quarantine at home. If the home visits were 160 being performed, the mental issues would be identified early, and the patient referred to a 161 psychiatrist more safely. The mistake that one of the suspects absconded the isolation 162 facilities before testing should not be taken lightly. Such patients have the danger of 163 initiating community spread of the virus. 164 165 Like what most African countries have done, the President has declared the coronavirus as a 166 national disaster. A COVID-19 National Preparedness and Response Plan was also launched. 167 Major events planned at the national level (Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and the 168 independence celebrations) were cancelled, schools and tertiary institutions will be closing 169 early. Social distancing continued to be promoted while gatherings of more than 100 people 170 were banned 30,31 . The local authority in Harare with support from development partners 171 set up several mobile hand washing points within the city. The city also started the city-wide 172 spraying of bus terminus, restaurants, pavements and other public places. The available 173 evidence regarding the spraying of cities to prevent coronavirus is conflicting. There might 174 no benefit in high-temperature countries like Zimbabwe 32,33 . There has been a debate on 175 whether the country should start implementing some of these infection and prevention 176 control without a case yet recorded. Experiences from countries affected early on China and 177 Italy, have shown that it is better to be overprepared than not to prepare at all 34,35 . The 178 WHO has created four transmission scenarios(no cases included) and countries are 179 encouraged to prepare according to their context 36 . to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to enhance the screening process 184 and infrastructure at all ports of entry. Travellers should be screened based on their point 185 origin as opposed to the departure airport of the aeroplane. Ports of entry, especially at the 186 borders, should be equipped with the necessary standard screening equipment and human 187 resources. Follow-up of patients on self-quarantine should be strengthened so that 188 complications or seroconversion are picked on time. Systems to track and trace contacts 189 should be in place to enable robust follow-up across all possible points of transmission along 190 the chain 37,38 . Efforts should be made to increase the number of laboratories with the 191 capacity to test for COVID-19 together with the necessary human resource support. This 192 should be accompanied by procuring more diagnostic test kits to increase the health care workers on mental, social, and psychological consequences of COVID-196 19 should be urgently implemented. Efforts should be made to assess these consequences 197 early on and support offered promptly since COVID-19 diagnosis can be traumatising. 198 Awareness should be given to the public and service providers against stigma and 199 discrimination of national from the source countries. The security at the isolation centres 200 should be improved to prevent cases from escaping leading to community transmission. 201 Increasing and equipping intensive care units at both the isolation centres and nearby 202 central hospitals should be prioritised especially with the ventilators. Respiratory distress is a 203 common complication of COVID-19. Procurement of personal protective equipment for the 204 isolation centres should be urgently prioritised. Awareness through various media on the 205 importance of general hygiene practices (hand washing and avoiding touching of the face) 206 should continue.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": ".

However, the well-structured screening process seems to be only80 available at Robert Mugabe International Airport.

Anecdotal reports from observers have highlighted that some immigration 91 officials were not checking the travel origination point.

A few of the suspects were also not screened after failing to meet the WHO 94 suspect criteria. This failure to screen might have been proper considering the limited 95 resources.
