ASMs [10, 11] are an extension of Finite State Machines (FSMs) where unstructured control states are replaced by states comprising arbitrary complex data (i.e., domains of objects with functions defined on them), and transitions are expressed by transition rules describing how the data (state function values saved into locations) change from one state to the next. ASM models can be read as \u201cpseudocode over abstract data\u201d which comes with a well defined semantics: at each computation step, all transition rules are executed in parallel by leading to simultaneous (consistent) updates of a number of locations.\n",

Tools supporting the process are part of the ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling) framework1 [4]. Requirements modelling starts by developing a high-level model called ground model (ASM 0 in Fig. 1). It is specified by reasoning on the informal requirements (generally given as a text in natural language) and using terms of the application domain, possibly with the involvement of all stakeholders. The ground model should correctly reflect the intended requirements and should be consistent, i.e., without possible ambiguities of initial requirements. It does not need to be complete, i.e., it may not specify some given requirements. The ground model and the other ASM models can be edited in AsmEE by using the concrete syntax AsmetaL [14]. Starting from the ground model, through a sequence of refined models, further functional requirements can be specified until a complete model of the system is obtained. The refinement process allows to tackle the system complexity, and to bridge, in a seamless manner, specification to code. At each refinement level, already at the level of the ground model, different V&V activities can be applied. In Sect. 4, we explain in detail how model validation and property verification are performed in ASMETA tools.",

The models are numbered from 1 to 9: models from CarSystem001 to CarSystem004 refer to the ELS, while the SCS is modelled from CarSystem005 to CarSystem007.

Therefore, at each level, an ASM results in the horizontal and vertical composition of ASM modules (by exploiting the import module feature). For example, Fig. 2 illustrates the ASM models structure in terms of horizontal and vertical imports for the first three refined levels of the CarSystem related to the ELS subsystem. Level 1 consists of an ASM CarSystem001main that imports module CarSystem001HW that imports module CarSystem001Blink, till the final module CarSystem001Domains is imported2. At this level, module relations are all horizontal imports. Similarly, ASM CarSystem002main imports (horizontally) module CarSystem002Cornering from the same refinement level, and it imports (vertically) module CarSystem001HW from the previous refinement level. Note that module CarSystem002Domains imports module CarSystem001Domains, since the former enlarges (as expected during refinement) the latter. Vertical relations can be also module refinement relations. For example, Fig. 3 focuses on level 4 and illustrates the ASM CarSystem004main that imports, among the others, the module CarSystem004HW refining module CarSystem001HW from level 1, and module CarSystem004Cornering refining module CarSystem002Cornering from level 2. Other depicted import/refinement relations are self-explanatory. More details on the refinement levels and corresponding models are given in Sect. 3.\n",

We are not able to deal with continuous time, although a notion of reactive timed ASMs has been proposed [17], there is no tool support for it. To overcome this limitation, we assume that a monitored function notifies the system whether an interval time is passed. For example, requirement ELS-18 states that low beam headlights remain active at least for 3 s. As shown in Code 1, we have introduced a monitored function passed3Sec that notifies if 3 s had elapsed since the low beam headlights received the command to be turned off. A further not addressed feature is the frequency of blinking. Since the model does not support continuous time it is not possible to set the direction lamps state (ON or OFF) every second (the duration of a flashing cycle is 1 s). Due to this limitation, we have introduced an enumerative value that indicates the current pulse ratio and we have supposed that the Head-Unit sets the state of direction lamp given the pulse ratio value.",

Code 2 shows that if hazard warning request is activated and any kind of blinking is running, blinking must be stopped and hazard warning is started. In case of direction blinking, the value of pitman arm is stored to restart the request as soon as hazard warning is deactivated; if the pitman arm is moved back to neutral position, the request is cancelled. The tail lamp status is updated to FIX or BLINK. It is BLINK only if blinking is active and car is sold in USA or Canada, otherwise it is FIX. Moreover, the value of light is dimmed by 50% during blinking (see Code 3). To address the requests from the pitman arm, we have defined three functions, pitmanArmUpDown for the incoming request, pitmanArmUpDown_RunnReq for the running request and pitmanArmUpDown_Buff to save the incoming request if it cannot be satisfied in the current state. When the running request has been processed, the request in the buffer is executed unless a new one arrives.\n",

The illumination distance and the luminous strength are adjusted according to characteristic curves provided in the requirements document. In order to calculate such values, we had to reverse engineered the formulas as suggested in the additional information provided with the specification document. We modelled this adaptive behaviour in terms of a MAPE-K feedback control loop that starts with the rule r_MAPE_HBH (see Code 4). A control loop in self-adaptive systems is a sequence of four computations: Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute (MAPE) over a knowledge base. In self-adaptive ASMs [5], it is modelled by means of four rules, one per MAPE computation, while the knowledge is modelled by means of functions, since in ASMs system memory is represented in terms of functions. In our case, the MAPE loop consists of the following rules invoked in a waterfall manner within one single ASM-step machine (see Code 4): r_Monitor_Analyze_HBH, where monitor and analyze computations are modelled as a unique activity; r_IncreasingPlan_HBH and r_DecreasingPlan_HBH to plan the adaptation if necessary: light illumination distance and luminous strength are increased or decreased according to the vehicle speed; r_Execute_HBH to set the values as planned: highBeamOn to activate/deactivate the high beam, highBeamRange and highBeamMotor for the high beam luminous strength and illumination distance.\n",

Avalla provides constructs to express execution scenarios in an algorithmic way, as interaction sequences consisting of actions committed by the user to set the environment (i.e., the values of monitored/shared functions), to check the machine state, to ask for the execution of certain transition rules, and to enforce the machine itself to make one step as reaction of the user actions.

Other inconsistencies, instead, were less easy to disambiguate.

We have also shown how to write and run scenarios and verify properties addressed by our models. We have found some misunderstanding in the document of requirements, because the described behaviour was different from the behaviour expected in validation sequences. We have found some limitations in our tools, e.g., the coverage evaluator provides only coverage in terms of macro rules, that we plan to overcome with future improvements. On the other hand, this case study has provided us the opportunity to test our framework in terms of robustness and user experience in modelling complex systems. We have noticed that the framework is particularly suitable to handle the increasing complexity of the models: the support for modularization (at the level of modelling and scenario construction) allows producing refined model and refined scenarios with limited effort.",
