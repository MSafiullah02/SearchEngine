            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia [CAP] is a common infectious disease encountered in all communities of the world, most frequently affecting the very young and the elderly. It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in severe cases and pneumonia is the third most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. However, statistics on the global or regional incidence and economic burden of CAP is lacking. It has been estimated that 4\u20136 million cases of CAP occur each year in the USA and approximately 20\u201325% require hospitalization [2, 3]. In the USA, CAP in all ages account for about 10 million physician visits annually and 600,000\u20131.1 million hospitalization each year with an estimated cost of over $17 billion annually [4, 5]. In Holland, it has been estimated that the incidence of CAP average 295 per 100,000 population per year and cost $711 [European Union] million over 4 years, total population of 16\u201317 million [6]. However, this analysis only included direct costs from hospitalization and not indirect economic burden from loss of employment. Limited data is available for the incidence and economic burden of CAP in the working-age population [age 18\u201364 years]. In a study from the USA, the overall incidence rate of CAP in this low-risk group was 10.6 per 1000 person years and 19.5% required hospitalization [7]. The average annual incremental cost ranged from $39,889 to $113,837 for inpatient management of patients with CAP and from $4170 to $31,524 for outpatient management.",

Initially this includes the aerodynamic barriers of the nasopharynx, cough reflex, and mucociliary clearance of foreign material and invaders of the tracheobronchial tree. Local production of immunoglobulins [IgA, IgG, and IgE] in the mucosa of the respiratory tract provides another layer of protection against invading microbes. The relative proportion of IgA and IgG in the respiratory tract changes with the location, greater ratio of IgA to IgG in the nasal mucosa, trachea and bronchial tree and reversed ratio in the alveoli with greater proportion of IgG [8]. IgA may be more important in protecting against viral infections, as it can neutralize several respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus [8]. But it may be involved in the mechanisms of preferential bacterial adherence. Whereas, most individuals with IgA deficiency do not have increased respiratory infections, those with IgG or certain IgG subclass deficiency have recurrent respiratory infections [8].",

Protection of the respiratory tract from microbial invaders is a complex process that involves many immune cells: dendritic cells, B and T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and their secretory products [immunoglobulins, cytokines, opsonins, enzymes, and oxygen metabolites]; and nonimmune opsonins such as surfactant, fibronectin fragments, and possibly C-reactive protein [8]. Recent studies indicate that progranulin, an autocrine growth factor expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, plays a protective role in lung immunity during bacterial pneumonia [9]. Elevated progranulin levels were observed in clinical and experimental bacterial pneumonia and it mediated host defense in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia.",

These normal microbes prevent the establishment of invading pathogenic microbes in the respiratory epithelium, the first step to induce infection. In the past decade, there has been marked interest and research on the role of the normal microbiome of the respiratory tract in health and disease. This has been facilitated by modern sophisticated, molecular, multiomics techniques. Recent studies of the human microbiome, including the respiratory tract, have demonstrated that the resident microflora is much more abundant and diverse than previously realized; including many species of nonculturable bacteria, viruses [virome], fungi, and protozoa. Present data indicate that the microbiome of the gut and the lungs are linked, by immune cells and mediators, and maybe important and associated with the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases [10\u201312]. The bronchial tract harbors a complex and dynamic microbial milieu of about 500 species, which overlaps with the oral microbiome [10]. The lung is also colonized by airway microbiota that resembles the microbiome of the mouth but not the nostrils at a lower density. Studies [10\u201312] have linked dysbiosis of the respiratory microbiome with asthma and chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]. However, there is no data as yet on association with acute pneumonia.",

Inciting factors that may play a role in the development of pneumonia include preceding viral upper respiratory tract infections [seen in nearly 50% of bacterial CAP]. These minor infections can result in defect in mucociliary function and clearance of aspirated bacteria and allow adherence of pathogens to the mucosa. It is quite possible that upper respiratory virus infections can result in dysbiosis of the commensal respiratory microbiome. Cigarette smoking can have a similar effect on airway defense and has been associated with dysbiosis of the resident microbiota.",

Finding viruses or pathogenic bacteria from nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens may not prove of causality in pneumonia, as they clearly can just be causing upper tract infection or colonization without producing lower respiratory disease. However, the absence of any specific pathogens from theses assays can effectively exclude them as etiology agents, since nearly all CAP is a result of aspiration of upper airway microbes. A combination of tests such as sputum Gram stain and culture, blood culture, urinary antigen and antibody response to the microbe[s] may be the most specific and reliable methods of determining causality, but are not highly sensitive nor provide rapid results to affect management. Future research should focus on rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests for etiologic diagnosis of CAP that could be used in emergency departments. Such methods may use immunoassays that could detect various bacterial pathogens or antigens semiquantitatively from sputum, blood, and urine in the form of a dipstick, similar to that of a urinalysis test.",

Typical mild cases of CAP with clinical symptoms of recent cough, fever, and the presence of chest crackles may be treated empirically without a chest X-ray or blood tests. However, normal chest examination can be present in about 50% of CAP. Chest radiograph is the standard investigation to confirm pneumonia in suspected cases and should be done in moderate\u2013severe CAP even in the presence of typical chest findings, to define the extent of lung[s] involvement, assess for presence of parapneumonic effusion or possible empyema, and the presence of pulmonary cavitation or abscess. The presence of necrotizing pneumonia restricts the etiologic diagnosis to a few bacteria and usually requires a longer duration of therapy.",

In these situations, the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the chest X-ray. Problems arise from differentiating pneumonia from pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]. Computerized tomography [CT] scan may or may not be able to differentiate these conditions. Bedside ultrasonography has been used for diagnosing pneumonia but is less reliable than radiography, with sensitivity ranging from 57% to 100% and specificity of 54% to 99% [37]. Ultrasound is more useful for defining the presence and severity of associated pleural effusion. Investigators have also assessed the value of molecular biomarkers in severely ill patients to differentiate CAP from noninfectious cause of lung infiltrates. In a study of 234 patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU] with suspected CAP genome-wide transcription profiling of blood leucocytes was investigated. Expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways was similar between patients with and without CAP, and blood concentrations of biomarkers such as procalcitonin, interleukin [IL]-6, and interleukin IL-8 were not discriminatory [38]. Further analysis revealed that the ratio of two genes, FAIM3 and PLAC8, was best for distinguishing CAP from no-CAP. The FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio provided a positive predictive value of 83.1% and negative predictive value of 81.3%. However, the clinical utility for management in seriously ill patients is questionable and further studies are needed.",

Thus, it would be premature to use steroids routinely in severe CAP, pending larger RCT in this subgroup of patients admitted to hospital. In the most recent review and meta-analysis of steroids in hospitalized patients with CAP, with analysis of 1506 cases from six trials, steroids reduced time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay by 1 day but did not reduce mortality and increased risk of hyperglycemia and CAP-related rehospitalization [86]. The state of the art is reminiscent of the data of steroids in sepsis/septic shock, when steroids appeared to be effective in reducing mortality based on small RCTs but was proven ineffective in larger, definitive trials. At least three large trials registered on Clinical Trials.gov are expected to enroll a total of 2300 patients and are scheduled for completion by October 2018 will provide more definitive data on the use of steroids in CAP. Future trials should investigate the effect of adding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDS] for the treatment of CAP.
