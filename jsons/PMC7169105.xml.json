Mycobacteria bind to macrophages in cholesterol and lipid\u2010rich domains of the host cell plasma membrane called lipid rafts,2 which are associated with various signalling mechanisms.3 Once within the cell, the organism can degrade cholesterol as energy source to maintain a chronic infection in the host.4 Additionally, mycobacterial interference with lipid\u2010mediated signalling arrests phagosome maturation, thus protecting the bacterium against delivery to the lysosome.5\n",

The binding of soluble CD13 to M. tuberculosis was detected by staining with phycoerythrin\u2010conjugated anti\u2010CD13 antibody and an isotype antibody as negative control. As demonstrated by the flow cytometry, a dose\u2010dependent increase of CD13\u2010positive M. tuberculosis organisms was observed with the binding of CD13 to M. tuberculosis reaching up to 6.53% (Fig. 1a,b). An irrelevant protein CD4 was concurrently utilized to test whether the binding of M. tuberculosis was specific for CD13. No apparent binding was observed between CD4 (0.5 \u03bcg) and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1a, bottom row). CD13\u2010MNP was also prepared to evaluate the binding affinity between CD13 and M. tuberculosis. While applying an external magnetic field to accelerate the process of aggregation, we noticed that CD13\u2010MNP aggregates were lightly coloured in comparison with those of MNP (Fig. 1c). We speculated that abundant M. tuberculosis organisms bound to CD13\u2010MNP shuttered the natural brown colour of MNP. To estimate the amount of unbound M. tuberculosis in the solution, we removed the aggregate pellets by applying an external magnetic field and estimated the density of mycobacteria in the solution by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (Fig. 1d). Prior to the addition of MNP, mycobacterial concentration was 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 107/mL. At 10 min after mixing, much less unbound M. tuberculosis (0.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 107/mL) was detected in the CD13\u2010MNP solution than in the MNP solution (2.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 107/mL). Following acid\u2010fast staining, the majority of plain nanoparticle aggregates were found to be small, with only occasional acid\u2010fast organisms seen (Fig. 1e). By contrast, CD13\u2010MNP aggregates occurred in large clusters surrounded by and intermingled with abundant acid\u2010fast organisms. These results indicate that soluble CD13 binds M. tuberculosis.",

Nevertheless, Zimmerli et al. found that blocking these two particular receptors with specific antibody did not alter the survival and growth of M. tuberculosis in human macrophages.22 Our data showed a somewhat different outcome because treatment with two dissimilar anti\u2010CD13 antibodies affected not only the internalization but also intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis in monocytes, particularly the WM47 antibody. This implies that WM47\u2010specific epitope on CD13 may be responsible for reducing intracellular M. tuberculosis survival. It has been shown that cross\u2010linking CD13 with a defined clone of anti\u2010CD13 antibodies induces cell activation, including mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase phosphorylation, calcium\u2010fluxing and homotypic aggregation of monocytes in an epitope\u2010dependent way.28, 29, 30 It seems likely that a series of interactions provoked by the treatment with anti\u2010CD13 may link to intracellular growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis in monocytes.",

One of the strategies used by M. tuberculosis to escape from phagosomes and grow within the cytosol of phagocytes is through modulating the phagosome acidification.31, 32, 33 We found that significantly lower pH value and higher number of active lysosomes (pH < 4.8) were observed in cells treated with WM47 but not with isotype control or WM15 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/resp.12191/suppinfo in the online supporting information). CD13 has been proposed as a possible receptor of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe,7 raising the possibility that CD13 participates in the uptake of cholesterol, the important nutrient for intracellular M. tuberculosis persistence. Further studies are needed to clarify these aspects.",
