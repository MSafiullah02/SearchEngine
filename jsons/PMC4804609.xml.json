However, the applicability of their results has been criticized because of restrictive selection criteria, with, commonly, exclusion of older adults and people with co-morbidities or severe disease [2\u20134]. Also, conducting an RCT is sometimes impossible or inappropriate (eg, when studying rare or long-term events) [1, 3, 5], which results in critical information gaps.",

With the aim of generating evidence that will guide healthcare decisions, the field of comparative effectiveness research (CER) emphasizes the need to incorporate data from observational studies to complement RCTs [8, 11\u201316]. A comprehensive assessment in 2009 indicated that 54 % of CER studies had an observational study design [17]. Therefore, an increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are including data from non-randomized studies to assess therapeutic interventions.",

However, some elements should be adapted specifically to the inclusion of non-randomized studies because their study designs inherently differ from RCTs [7, 9, 14, 18\u201323]. Lacking randomization, they are likely subject to confounding bias, which results in an imbalance in prognostic factors associated with the outcome of interest that may severely compromise the validity of their results [24].",

We verified whether the meta-analysis was registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews by the University of York\u2019s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (PROSPERO). We collected whether epidemiologists or statisticians were involved, relying on the definition given by Delgado-Rodriguez et al.[33] and assessed whether the authors reported the funding sources and declared conflict of interests. We assessed whether the meta-analyses evaluated a pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention. Non-pharmacological interventions were classified as surgical procedures or other interventions. We also assessed the type of studies included: only NRSI or both NRSI and RCTs.Systematic review methods:\u25aaSearch strategy: We collected how many and which electronic databases were searched, and whether the search strategy for at least one database was provided. We collected whether reference lists and journals were hand-searched and whether the authors searched for grey literature, and if yes, how: search of registries (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov), conference abstracts, or contacting experts. We assessed whether the authors restrict their searches by language.\u25aaStudy selection and data extraction process: We assessed whether study selection and data extraction were conducted in duplicate.\u25aaContact of the study authors: We noted whether it was mentioned that study authors were contacted for clarification or additional results.\u25aaMethodological quality/risk of bias assessment: We assessed whether methodological quality or risk of bias assessment was conducted, what tools were used, and whether the assessment was conducted in duplicate.Meta-analysis methods:\u25aaStudies combined: We assessed the types of NRSI included. NRSI were categorized as concurrent (prospective) cohort, nonconcurrent (retrospective) cohort, case\u2013control, or historically controlled studies according to the definition by Ioannidis et al. [21].

One of the key methodological elements is the search for relevant studies. Because not all studies (and particularly those with negative results) are published in scientific journals, a meta-analysis must involve a search for grey literature to try to avoid such publication bias (a type of reporting bias) [24, 35]. However, we found that only 38 % of our meta-analyses reported having searched for grey literature. Because of no mandatory registration for NRSI as for RCTs, most NRSI are not registered, so searching for grey literature of NRSI is difficult [36]. However, a recent study found that for 32 % of the observational studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, unpublished results could be retrieved [37]. In contrast, we found that many meta-analyses assessed reporting bias (68 %). Reviewers may have compensated for the absence of searching for grey literature by assessing reporting bias. Evaluating reporting bias does not exempt the reviewers from searching for grey literature because the assessment of Funnel plot asymmetry may be subjective and statistical methods to test for asymmetry of the plot may lack power [38, 39].",
