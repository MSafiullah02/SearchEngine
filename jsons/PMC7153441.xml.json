It is relatively uncomplicated with respect to structure (straight tube) and microscopic appearance (respiratory epithelium and submucosal glands). The main species differences in tracheal morphology involve submucosal glands: their number and their location along the trachea. The histology of the rat, dog and monkey is shown in Fig. 8.4 (Choi et al. 2000). Tracheal submucosal glands are typically more numerous in the ventral trachea (except for the pig in which the dorsal trachea has more glands). Submucosal glands are found throughout the trachea in all species but are in higher numbers in association with the first three cartilage rings in the rat and are only found at the junction of the larynx and trachea in the mouse. Submucosal gland position in relationship to cartilage rings varies between species. Glands are more often between tracheal rings in rats and are found between and about cartilage rings in the nonhuman primate and dog (Choi et al. 2000). Tracheal length influences particle deposition in the respiratory tract. Tracheal length in relationship to its diameter is longer in the dog, rat and mouse when compared to the human and results in less particle deposition in the large airways of these animals (Lippmann and Schlesinger 1984).\n",

All structures in the respiratory tract that eventually lead to the alveolus are designed to deliver air that is warm, humidified and free of particulate matter, microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.) and toxins. Structural protection in the lung consists of dichotomously branching airways which trap materials to allow clearance by the mucociliary apparatus. Airway branching can be symmetric (daughter airways of similar diameter) or asymmetric (major and minor daughter airways). Airway branching varies in species being symmetric in primate species (human, monkey) and asymmetric in dogs and rodents (Fig. 8.5). Airway branching affects distribution of inhaled material with humans and monkeys having greater upper bronchial particle deposition and deposition at bifurcations (which is also influence by oral breathing in humans) (Lippmann and Schlesinger 1984).\n",

When examining the six levels of the rat nasal cavity (Mery et al. 1994), respiratory epithelium lines the nasal septum (Fig. 8.6) and the dorsal meatus in the most rostral section caudal to the nares (section between the upper incisor and incisive papilla); it lines the nasoturbinates and dorsal septum in the section at the level of the incisive papilla; it then lines the most ventral aspect of the nasal cavity (ventral aspect of most ventral ethmoturbinates, nasopharyngeal duct and nasopharynx) in the sections of the caudal nose (Fig. 8.6) at the level of the second palatal ridge and molars (Mery et al. 1994). Respiratory epithelium is present in the larynx (base of epiglottis in rodents, diverticula of monkeys and caudal aspect of larynx surrounded by cricoid cartilage in rodents, dogs and monkeys) but generally does not contain mucus (goblet) cells. (Renne and Gideon 2006). Ciliated cells are abundant in the respiratory epithelium but with decreasing airway size in the lung, the proportion of ciliated cells decreases along with the cilia height (Stannard and O'Callaghan 2006). The most abundant type of cilia in respiratory tract epithelium are motile cilia which are found in clusters of 100 to 300 on the apical cell surface (Jain et al. 2010). Motile cilia have a basal foot process which results in cilia pointing in the same direction and allows them to have a coordinated beat to clear mucus from the respiratory tract (Stannard and O'Callaghan 2006). Motile cilia have a 9 + 2 microtubular structure composed of 9 doublets on the periphery with dynein arms and a central microtubular pair (Fig. 8.8). The central pair is attached to the peripheral doublets via radial spokes and the tubular structures are linked by nexin (A and B tubule doublets) or surrounded by an inner sheath (central microtubules) (Fig. 8.8). In addition to motile cilia, primary cilia have been identified in the respiratory tract and have a 9 + 0 tubule arrangement devoid of a central microtubule pair, dynein arms or radial spokes. Primary cilia have a sensory role and are observed in the retina, nasal cavity, biliary ducts and endothelium (Jain et al. 2010).\n",

Mucus turnover time in the rostral nose of the rat is much faster (10 min) than the caudal nose (several days) (Harkema et al. 2006). The mucociliary apparatus in the larynx and trachea of the dog shows a velocity gradient with greater flow in the upper trachea and cricoid regions which extends into the interarytenoid region and eventually slows in the epiglottis regions where the mucus can be swallowed (Bridger and Proctor 1972). The transition from squamous to respiratory epithelium in the larynx occurs at the base of the epiglottis in rats but squamous epithelium extends more caudally in the dog and monkey (Renne et al. 2007, Renne and Gideon 2006). Ciliated epithelium in the larynx is more abundant in the dorsal larynx (Renne and Gideon 2006). In the lung, decrease in mucus transport velocity occurs as airways branch most likely due to lower numbers of ciliated cells as well as the smaller airway diameter.",

Mucus has thixotropic properties, acting as a fluid when stirred and semisolid when standing (Lai et al. 2009) which is accomplished through the varied properties of the mucus associated with the epithelium. Periciliary mucus is liquid while that overlying cilia is a gel allowing cilia to beat rhythmically and propel mucus rostrally. Mucus act as a first responder to inhaled particulate matter (inorganic, bacteria, viruses), gases and toxins through a variety of mechanisms (Lai et al. 2009). Mucus not only traps particulate matter and gases but also has antimicrobial and clearance properties. Stored mucus (intraepithelial mucus) is more abundant in the rostral nasal cavity and this is consistent with abundant mucus (goblet) cells in nasal respiratory epithelium (Fig. 8.6).\n",

            "text": "Mucin glycoproteins are a major constituent of mucus with mucin gene and protein expressed in the upper and lower upper respiratory tract of the human, nonhuman primate, rat, mouse and dog. Mucins are glycosylated macromolecules with a protein core and sugar chains that vary in size and composition that give mucus its viscous and elastic nature and the ability to trap foreign substances in the respiratory tract (Thornton et al. 2008). Mucins in the respiratory tract are divided into two categories, secreted (Table 8.1) and tethered (Table 8.2) which form a raft overlying the epithelium (secreted and tethered) or are associated with the cell membrane (tethered) (Fig. 8.10). Secreted (gel-forming) mucins are the most abundant and make up about 90 % of the respiratory mucin content in the human, are the gel portion of mucus and are stored in mucus (goblet) cells of the respiratory epithelium and the mucus cells or serous cells of the submucosal glands. Secreted mucins are released in response to secretagogues (e.g., eicosanoids, inflammatory mediators, bacterial products, inhaled toxins) (Rose and Voynow 2006, Hattrup and Gendler 2008, Thornton et al. 2008, Adler and Li 2001). Tethered mucins make up approximately 10 % of the total respiratory mucin content in humans and are produced by ciliated cells. Tethered mucins are on the cell surface, associated with cilia and microvilli with a membrane-spanning domain and a cytoplasmic tail and make up the periciliary layer of mucus. Tethered mucins participate in the barrier funciton of mucus with secreted mucins but may also trigger signaling pathways (Williams et al. 2001, Hattrup and Gendler 2008). MUC1 and MUC16 have epitopes to allow adhesion of various molecules while MUC4 does not and may allow cells to evade immune recognition (Hattrup and Gendler 2008, Kesimer et al. 2013). There are species differences in types of mucin expression in the respiratory tract (Tables 8.1 and 8.2), with the more thorough investigations of mucins reported in the trachea and lung, especially of the human and to a lesser degree in the nonhuman primate, rat and mouse. Little has been published on mucin types in the dog and in the nasal cavity of all species but there has been limited examination in the human nose (Aust et al. 1997). Mucins from respiratory mucus (goblet) cells are typically nonsulfated in the rat (sialomucin) and sulfated in the dog (sulfomucin) (Spicer and Martinez 1984).\n\n\n",

Increased mucus production due to hypersecretion by mucus (goblet) cells and/or submucosal glands can be induced by ozone, cigarette smoke, cytokines [TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-13, IL-17], neutrophil elastase, allergens and microbial pathogens (Ganesan et al. 2013, Adler and Li 2001). Increased mucus will also occur due to increased numbers of mucus (goblet) cells as a result of hyperplasia or metaplasia (Samet and Cheng 1994). Mucus (goblet) cell metaplasia and hyperplasia are induced by EGFR and IL-13 (Ganesan et al. 2013). Increased EGFR expression can result from oxidants derived from neutrophil elastase, cigarette smoke and diesel emissions (Casalino-Matsuda et al. 2006). In addition to greater amounts of mucus, increased expression of specific mucins is observed with toxin exposure. Acrolein, an aldehyde found in smog and tobacco smoke, will induce mucus hypersecretion and increased expression of Muc5ac (trachea and lung) (Borchers et al. 1998). Muc5ac expression is also elevated after ozone exposure in the nose and lung (Samet and Cheng 1994, Fanucchi et al. 1998). Occasionally, mucin production is decreased, as was noted in a murine asbestos inhalation model using osteopontin null mice in which the amount of mucin observed on Periodic Acid Schiff stained lungs was decreased in distal bronchioles (Sabo-Attwood et al. 2011). Mucus composition can be altered after exposure to air pollutants. For example, pH alteration after sulfur dioxide exposure reduces mucus viscosity while increased mucus viscosity can result from protein cross-linking after formaldehyde exposure (Samet and Cheng 1994) and mucus acidification.",

This loss may be temporary, followed by regeneration of ciliated cells, but with sustained injury and repair, hyperplasia and/or metaplasia may occur. The latter changes may or may not be reversible and there may be permanent mucociliary impairment. Exposure to aged and diluted sidestream cigarette smoke followed by naphthalene exposure in mice results in impaired respiratory epithelial repair in terminal bronchioles resulting in loss of normal club and ciliated epithelium (Van Winkle et al. 2001). Impairment of ciliary function can be noted with exposure to sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, cigarette smoke and formaldehyde. However, other respiratory pathology with these compounds has a more pronounced effect and the ciliary impairment may not be a major factor in the overall pathologic process (Samet and Cheng 1994). Ciliary dysfunction can also occur in association with increased amounts and viscosity of mucus (Ganesan et al. 2013). Impairment of ciliary function without loss of numbers of ciliated cells or cilia can occur during anesthesia or with cold temparatures (Christopher et al. 2014).",

Trefoil factors are highly expressed at mucosal surfaces where they are intimately associated with mucins and participate in the health and maintenance of the mucosa (Goke and Podolsky 1996). The function of these molecules has been most extensively studied in the gastrointestinal tract. Trefoil factors are involved in mucosal restitution after epithelial injury; they maintain viscosity of the mucus layer and can modulate the immune system by controlling lymphocyte migration. Trefoil factors are most often found in conjunction with mucins in mucus (goblet) cells and in submucosal glands. In the respiratory system, they have been found in mucus (goblet) cells, submucosal glands and club cells in the trachea and lung. Species differences in trefoil expression are presented in Table 8.3. TFF2 has the highest expression in the mouse lung but is undetectable in humans. In contrast, TFF3 has the highest expression in human lungs. TFF1 and TFF3, with normal low expression in mice, show elevations after epithelial injury using a naphthalene model of club cell injury and repair (Greeley et al. 2010). After experimental allergen exposure using OVA and albumin, increased TFF2 expression in mice is regulated by a Th2 response (Nikolaidis et al. 2003). TFF2 may be involved in neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment after house dust mite antigen exposure and in goblet cell metaplasia and eosinophil recruitment after IL-13 administration in the mouse lung (Wills-Karp et al. 2012). TFF1, which normally has low expression in club cells, is induced in the mouse lung after experimental allergen exposure using Aspergillus fumigatus antigen, and this expression is noted largely in transdifferentiating club cells (Kouznetsova et al. 2007). Rhesus macaques (6 and 12 months old) exposed to ozone for 11 cycles (cycle = 0.5 ppm for 8 h for 5 days) had no change in TFF1 expression, but TFF3 expression increased and was noted in both mucus cells and ciliated cells in the proximal airways of the lung (Greeley 2008).\n",

There are two types of defensins, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which have a similar \u03b2 sheet structure but differing cysteine disulfide bonds (Ganz 2002). Defensins are constituitively expressed in neutrophils and epithelium but can also be induced by cytokines and endotoxin in monocytes and CD8 lymphocytes (Oppenheim et al. 2003). \u03b1-defensins are primarily found in leukocyte (neutrophil) granules in humans, rats and monkeys, in alveolar macrophages of rabbits and are also noted in epithelia (rabbit kidney, human female reproductive tract and Paneth cells) (Selsted and Ouellette 2005). Only the mouse lacks neutrophil \u03b1-defensins (Ganz 2002). \u03b1-defensins have antimicrobial and antiviral activity, can regulate complement activation, degranulate mast cells, are chemotactic for T-cells and immature dendritic cells, block endotoxin binding and can block ACTH receptors (Oppenheim et al. 2003). Rhesus macaques, baboons and orangutans also have \u03f4-defensin in their neutrophil granules. \u03f4-defensin mRNA has been found in human bone marrow but this mRNA is not translated into protein. \u03b2-defensins are observed in epithelia of humans, monkeys, rats and mice, including the respiratory tract (Ganz 2002). \u03b2-defensins also have antimicrobial activity, can induce prostaglandin D2 production, degranulate mast cells and are chemotactic for CCR6 dendritic cells (Oppenheim et al. 2003). Three human defensins (HBD-1, -2 and -3) are found in the respiratory tract (Ganz 2002). HBD-1 and -2 RNA and protein were expressed in cell cultures of human trachea and bronchi (localized to surface epithelium and submucosal glands). HBD-2 expression increased with IL-1\u03b2 exposure (Singh et al. 1998) whereas HBD-1 expression did not change, even with exposure to lipopolysaccharide or other cytokines (Singh et al. 1998). Mouse \u03b2-defensins 1 and 3 are found in respiratory epithelium of the nose, trachea, large proximal airways and distal airways. The expression of \u03b2-defensin 1 is greater than \u03b2-defensin 3 in the mouse respiratory tract. \u03b2-defensin 3 is upregulated after infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Bals et al. 1998, Bals et al. 1999). A novel \u03b2-defensin (\u03b2-defensin 4) has also been found in the trachea of mice (Jia et al. 2000). Rat \u03b2-defensins are found in the respiratory epithelium of the trachea (\u03b2-defensin 1) and in type II pneumocytes of the lung (\u03b2-defensin 2) (Jia et al. 1999).",

After exposure to bacterial LPS, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 levels are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 30\u201390 min after exposure (Thacker 2006). These elevations are observed even when alveolar macrophages are depleted, suggesting other cells in the lung, such as interstitial macrophages or type II pneumoncytes, can produce these inflammtory mediators (Elder et al. 2005). IL-22 is produced by Th22, Th1, CD8+ T cells, NK cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with pro-inflammatory and protective effects in the lung and these effects are mediated by IL-17A (Besnard et al. 2011, Sonnenberg et al. 2010). IL-22 transcript is elevated in the lung of mice after experimental asthma (ovalbumin exposure) and is needed for allergic airway inflammation through increased Th2 cytokines during the antigen sensitization phase of asthma. IL-22 can upregulate MUC1, \u03b2-defensins and neutrophil chemokines in respiratory epithelium (Besnard et al. 2011). Inflammation and associated epithelial injury with production of IL-22 and IL-17A by CD4+ TH17 cells is observed in mice after bleomycin administration. IL17 null mice have higher IL-22 expression but less bleomycin-induced inflammation and reduced apoptosis of airway epithelium (Sonnenberg et al. 2010).",

Asthma is an ongoing type I hypersensitivity in the lung that begins with initial exposure to antigen and involvement of the innate immune system (neutrophils, lung macrophages) and subsequent involvement of the acquired immune system (T-helper 2 cells and IgE), which results in airway hyperreactivity, chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation, mucus cell hyperplasia and airway muscle changes. Asthma in juveniles can be induced by exposure to oxidant air pollutants (including ozone) in early childhood during postnatal lung development, resulting in alterations in alveolar morphogenesis, airway branching and development, and airway innervation (Tran et al. 2004, Plopper et al. 2007, Plopper and Fanucchi 2000, Miller et al. 2003). Conversely, asthma may be prevented by exposure to endotoxin and antigens during childhood and this has been noted in children growing up on farms (Kaiser 2015). Exposing mice to endotoxin prior to exposure to house dust mite antigen blunts the initial innate immune response to that antigen (Schuijs et al. 2015). A potential similar benefit has been noted with early exposure to household pets (cats and dogs) but the results have been contradictory in the multiple cohort studies conducted (Lau et al. 2000, Remes et al. 2001, Chen et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Exposure to metal cations in the lung can result in hypersensitivity. Exposure to beryllium itself does not induce hypersensitivity in the lung. Initially, it was thought that beryllium bound to an unspecifed protein in the lung resulted in antigenicity of beryllium and CD4+ T cells reactive to the beryllium hapten with eventual granuloma formation in the lung (Albright and Goldstein 1996). More recent research has shown that reaction to inhaled beryllium shows both hypersensitivity and autoimmunity (Clayton et al. 2014). Beryllium is buried in a complex composed of HLA-DP2 (MHC II allele) and a self peptide, thus altering the MHC II molecule\u2019s recognition by the T cell receptor and subsequent hypersensitivity. Exposure to other metals such as aluminum (smelters, miners), arsenic and cadmium (tobacco smoke and/or fungicides), chromium (manufacturing), nickel (fossil fuel combustion, mining) and vanadium (coal burning) may result in lung pathology but the extent of the pathology is dependent on metal solubility (Cohen 2004). Exposure to aluminum may result in alveolar macrophage activation and neutrophil influx. Arsenic inhalation may cause an initial influx of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages and eventual suppression of lymphocyte IL-2 secretion, decreased complement levels and production of acute phase proteins (Cohen 2004). Cadmium exposure also results in suppression of cell-mediated immunity. Chromium can enhance T-lymphocyte proliferation at low concentrations but suppress it at higher concentrations given that it may be clastogenic (Cohen 2004). Nickel exposure suppresses humoral immune responses in mice (inhalation exposure) and rats (drinking water exposure), but immune suppression has not been readily documented in human exposure. Human exposure to nickel can result in asthma and may result from Ni-albumin conjugates (Cohen 2004). Inhalation of vanadium is followed by systemic exposure and formation of pentavalent vanadates and oxides with alterations in pulmonary immunity (e.g., decreased alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, reduced cytokine levels ) and subsequent bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, rhinitis and pharyngitis (Cohen et al. 2007, Cohen 2004).",

Nanotubes typically range in size from 1 to 100 \u03bcm and can be composed of carbon, gold, boron, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide and silver (Hubbs et al. 2011, Thompson et al. 2014). Composition and deposition location of nanotubes will affect the immune response (Thompson et al. 2014). As smaller nanotubes are constructed, their toxicity increases because they can penetrate many organs, including the lung (Thompson et al. 2014). Nanotubes can have immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects (Thompson et al. 2014). After inhalation of single-walled carbon nanotubes, pulmonary granulomas were noted in rats that had either inhaled or aspirated the nanotubes (Hubbs et al. 2011). Granuloma formation with nanotubes occurs after aggregation of nanotubes, which is more likely with intratracheal instillation or oropharyngeal aspiration. Interstitial fibrosis occurs when nanotubes are more dispersed in the lung, which may occur after inhalation of dry aerosolized or nebulized suspensions (Thompson et al. 2014). Inhalation of single-walled carbon nanotubes by mice or cerium dioxide nanoparticles in rats was associated with neutrophil influx in the lung (Hubbs et al. 2011, Morimoto et al. 2015). In another study with highly dispersed single-walled carbon nanotubes, neutrophil inflammation did not persist but interstitial fibrosis was observed after only 4 days of exposure (Hubbs et al. 2011). Exposure of mice to low concentrations of multi-walled carbon nanotubes for 14 days resulted in suppression of T-cell dependent immune functions but exposing mice at higher concentrations for up to 13 weeks resulted in granulomatous inflammation and pleural thickening (Hubbs et al. 2011). Inhalation of silver nanoparticles by rats for 28 days resulted in increased size and number of goblet cells that contained neutral mucins with no change in sulfo- or sialomucins (Hyun et al. 2008) Inhalation of silver nanoparticles by rats for 90 days resulted in alveolar inflammation, perivascular infiltrate and alveolar macrophage accumulation in the lungs (Sung et al. 2009). Inhalation of carbon black nanoparticles followed by ovalbumin challenge will result in enhanced inflammatory response to the ovalbumin due to enhancement of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 by carbon black nanoparticles (Hubbs et al. 2011).",

Cationic amphophilic drugs cause accumulation/retention of the cell membrane component, phospholipid, in cell lysosomes in many tissues. This accumulation results from the affinity of the basic cationic amphophilic drugs to the acidic environment of the lysozome, with ionization of the drug and subsequent inability to leave the lysozome, as well as the direct interaction with the drug and phospholipid of the membrane (Anderson and Borlak 2006). In the lung, the alveolar macrophage and type II pneumocyte are susceptible to phospholipid accumulation. There is accumulation of large, foamy alveolar macrophages and amorphous material in alveolar spaces. This accumulation is reversible after cessation of the compound (Halliwell 1997). Macrophage accumulation of lamellar bodies may inhibit cellular phospholipases and prevent cytotoxicity of phagocytosed silica (Reasor and Kacew 2001, Anderson and Borlak 2006) and may also enhance phagocytic activity of macrophages (Anderson and Borlak 2006).",

Neonatal rodents have a lower level of lymphocyte trafficking from regional lymph nodes and have fewer antigen presenting cells (MHC II) that function poorly when compared to adults (Miller 2004). Alveolar macrophage numbers are greater in human infants when compared to teenagers and adults, and a similar trend is noted in nonhuman primates (Miller 2004). However, alveolar macrophages in newborn monkeys have poor phagocytic and killing capabilities. In contrast, alveolar macrophages of neonatal rats have greater phagocytic and killing ability for certain pathogens such as gram negative and positive bacteria (Miller 2004). Dendritic cells in the respiratory tract are first observed at the base of the nasal turbinates in newborn rats and then increase in number with age along the respiratory tract (Condon et al. 2011). Mucosal and connective tissue mast cells are in very low numbers in the rat at birth but increase with age (Wilkes et al. 1992).",
