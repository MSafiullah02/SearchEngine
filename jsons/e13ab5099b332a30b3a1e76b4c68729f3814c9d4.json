This follows recent, salutary experiences including a variety of severe natural disasters, e.g., Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, fl ooding, landslides, forest fi res (in California) and drought. George Luber, head of the Climate and Health Programme of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been central to this rising awareness in the United States. Luber claims that the climate change has extended the pollen season in some parts of the country by as much as 26 days, increasing the risk of allergy and asthma attacks. It has also contributed to heavier rainfalls, which can jeopardise drinking water quality. \"Climate change isn't just about polar bears and penguins or impacts distant in time\", Luber told The Lancet . He went on to explain that these impacts affect our communities and people's health, so \"putting the human dimension on climate change is vital not only for understanding threat we face but also for encouraging action\" (Jaffe 2015 ).",

However, even after independence, inequalities in India have risen. India is in dire need of energy (per capita electricity consumption in India is 618 KW and in the United States 14,240) to enable infrastructure development. But there are also gross global inequalities. Most developing countries, including India, have the lowest per capita CO2 emission (1.2 t per capita in India compared to 20.6 t in the United States), as well as the low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Despite this, major developed nations insist that developing nations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, fundamental to their socioeconomic development. However, under the Kyoto Protocol, the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility\" was considered as fundamental for future emission negotiations. This will promote equity and human development by expanding access to energy demand of developing countries (Akhtar 2010 ). India's offi cial thinking on climate change is derived from a policy advanced by Manmohan Singh, who served as the country's prime minister until 2014. In 2007, he declared at a G20 summit in Germany that India's per capita emissions will never exceed the average per capita emissions for developed countries. Right now, that gives India quite a bit of elbow room. If the United States and the European Union are able to attain the cuts they are now talking of, India's leeway shrinks; though some in the Indian government believe that even then the country could continue to increase its emissions for 15 or 20 years beyond the 2030 cap China has agreed to and still fall below the developed world's per capita average.",

This means that developed economies, chiefl y the United States, which spent the last century building their economies while pumping warming emissions into the atmosphere, bear the greatest responsibility for cutting pollution. India's Minister further clarifi ed that government agencies in New Delhi were preparing plans for India's domestic actions on climate change, but he said they would lead only to a lower rate of increase in carbon emissions. It would be at least 30 years, he said, before India would likely see a downturn.",

We posit that the motivation for this radical shift can be attributed to rising concerns about the projected impacts of climate change in China, and also the government's recognition that China's traditional development model is unsustainable, not only environmentally, but also from the standpoint of social and economic development. The Chinese central government has been searching for mechanisms to transform China's development trajectory, and climate change policy represents a new and justifi able tool that can help the government transform economic development in China, especially because climate policy can be used as a new central government instrument to guide and control the behaviour of local governments\" (Xiaowei and Gallagher 2014 ).",

According to the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future was agreed by 195 nations. This Agreement \"underwrites adequate support to developing nations and establishes a global goal to signifi cantly strengthen adaptation to climate change through support and international cooperation. The Paris Agreement's major objective is to keep a global temperature rise within 21st century well below 2 \u00b0 Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.50 \u00b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\" http://unfccc.int Climate change may affect health through a variety of pathways. These include the effects of an increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, a reduction in cold-related deaths, more frequent and more intense fl oods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and risk of disasters and malnutrition (Haines, 2014, Personal communication) . In another study, Andy Haines and colleagues warned that the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5) assume that present trends of relatively unrestrained use of fossil fuels and high population growth will continue. According to this emission pathway, by 2100 the global average temperature will probably be more than 4 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels with higher average temperatures over lands ). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the Chapter on Human Health, affi rms with very high confidence that the health of human population is sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and other aspects of climate change. The Chapter also projects (1) greater risks of injury, disease and death due to more intense heat waves and fi res (very high confidence)\u037e (2) increased risks of food and waterborne diseases (very high confi dence) and (3) increased risk of undernutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions (high confi dence) ).",

(Coker et al. 2011 ) Thus disease ecological scenario in the South and Southeast Asian region (except Singapore) is highly vulnerable. This vulnerability has acquired a serious proportion when we consider the latest IPCC Fifth Assessment Report ( 2014 ) on Asia. The Report highlights that warming trends and increasing extreme temperature are exacerbated by coastal and marine systems that are under increasing stress from both climatic and nonclimatic driver. The geography of large coastal areas here also makes South and Southeast Asia two of the many places around the world that are susceptible to several different kinds of infectious diseases. Water scarcity is also a major challenge for most of the regions because of rapid and unplanned urbanization, industrialization and select regional economic development by climate change. In addition extreme climate events will have an increasing impact on human health. Frequent and intense heat waves in Asia will increase mortality and morbidity in vulnerable groups. Increase in heavy rain and temperature will increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, dengue fever and malaria. Increases in fl oods (as occurred in Pakistan in 2010 and in Thailand in 2011 and drought in India in 2009) will exacerbate rural poverty in parts of the South and Southeast Asian region due to impaired crop production.",

The Report found that infectious and parasitic diseases comprise 13.9% of total mortality, followed by respiratory diseases with 11.5% of total deaths. To sum up, there are widespread regional inequalities in the health effects of exposures related to water, sanitation, hygiene and those caused by vectors, food and air pollution. The challenge from the climate and health perspective is to devise mitigation and adaptation policies that can lower these risks.",

The Bank estimates that in Southeast Asia, the economic cost of climate change could be as high as 6.7 % of GDP per year by 2100. This is more than twice the world average (ADB 2012 (ADB -2013 An alternative conceptual framework is to consider the health problems of climate change in South and Southeast Asia (and elsewhere) as having three pathways -\"primary\", \"secondary\" and \"tertiary\". In this model, primary effects are considered the most causally direct impacts of climate change on health. They include increased mortality during heat waves as what repeatedly occurred in India and elsewhere in South Asia. In the month of May 2015 alone, more than 1200 people died due to heat wave mainly in southeastern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, as well as in northern India (TOI 2015 ) . The effects of \"natural\" disasters such as fl ooding, hailstorms, droughts and severe cyclones, all of which are arguably worsened by climate change (including sea level rise in coastal regions), are also considered \"primary\" in this conceptualization. \"Secondary\" effects include via ecological changes that alter the epidemiology of some infectious diseases and chronic diseases, for example, the 1994 malaria outbreak in the Rajasthan desert following from extremely heavy rainfall and fl ooding (Akhtar and McMichael 1996 ) . The health impact of allergens and air pollution, each of which interacts with climate change, can also be considered secondary effects. Tertiary effects refer to large-scale events with complex, multidimensional causation, including migration, famine and confl ict. Unfortunately, all three forms of tertiary health effects are seen in countries of the region (Singh et al. 2015 ) . Heat stress, on a suffi cient scale, could also be called a tertiary effect.",
