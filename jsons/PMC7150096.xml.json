            "text": "Captive husbandry of crocodilians varies with species and country of location. In the United States, the American Alligator industry is also varied between and even within states. In Louisiana, most of the operations are ranches. In Florida, both ranches and farm operations are found. In a ranch operation, buildings are either circular (Figure 41-1\n) or rectangular with some divisions on the inside to create a number of individual pens. The buildings are completely enclosed with one or two entrances and no source of light. The pens usually allow communication of water and are lined with rubber, fiberglass, or other nonporous material. Heating elements may also be contained within the concrete slab to aid in temperature control. Water heaters are used to maintain temperature when refilling the pens. Water sources can be city water, well water, or bayou water. Most operations do not use a filtration system. Temperature is the only water parameter routinely monitored. The frequency of cleaning the pens can range from three to six times a week depending on the ranch and the size of the animals. A commercial pelleted diet is readily available, and some diets are supplemented with chicken, fish, or nutria. Vitamin supplements are sometimes mixed with the feed. Feed is typically placed on a suspended wooden table in the middle of the pen. Feeding frequency is five to six times per week. A complete history is essential in diagnosis of diseases in a crocodilian operation.",

            "text": "Many diseases of crocodilians are considered to be caused by stress. Stress has been defined as \u201ca physiological answer to a perceived threat that includes, but is not restricted to, increased adrenal secretion.\u201d1 Stress is also thought of as any event that challenges homeostasis, and likely the response to that challenge involves more than an adrenal response. The autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic adrenal axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neuroimmunologic mediators all have a role in the response of the immune system to stress.2How stress and immunosuppression are mea-sured is still a subject of controversy in veterinary medicine. No one test can be used to measure stress, but rather physiologic changes are combined to give an idea of what is involved in a stress response. A number of research studies have examined the stress response in crocodilians. These studies have looked at the stress associated with restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities.3, 4, 5, 6 Lance, Morici, and Elsey7 provide an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians. Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians. In addition, an argument is made for immunosuppression on the basis of changes observed in the white blood cells.3, 4, 5, 7 The factors that influence stress in crocodilian and reptile species are reviewed by Rooney and Guillette.1 Enough evidence exists to suggest that stress plays an important role in the physiology of crocodilians, and it may indeed predispose them to illness. Overcrowding, handling, excessive noise, diet changes, temperature irregularities, etc., should all be considered as predisposing or confounding factors of disease. These need to be a consideration with diagnostics and recommendation of treatment for these species.",

The workers notice excess food remaining on the tables from the day before, which is sometimes followed by a perceived change in the behavior of the animals. One should not underestimate these observations because most workers are well tuned to the daily routine and behavior of the animals. A visit to the ranch or farm should be performed during feeding time to avoid additional stress to the animals. This also allows observation of the feeding and water change practices. At this time, a thorough history and a collection of animals for diagnostics and necropsy can be obtained.

Gross lesions can be seen as multifocal, 1-mm to 2-mm, gray to red foci on the ventral mandibular, abdominal, and sometimes tail scales (Figure 41-4\n). They can be found on any section of a scale and do not appear concave or convex with respect to the scale's surface. Routine microscopic examination reveals dermal nodular lymphoid proliferation with perivascular cuffing. Similar lesions have also been observed in other tissues besides the skin. One of the problems with identification of the lesions is that they are sometimes not seen until the hides are removed from the animal. Therefore, antemortem identification is not very accurate at this time. The etiology of this syndrome is unknown, but various research projects are examining the possibilities.",

This represents an opportunity for zoonosis in captive operations. Some suspect cases exist of alligator to human transmission. A strict building quarantine and hygiene strategies should be implemented to prevent spread to other animals in the facility and to the workers. This is now a reportable disease, and one should contact the state veterinarian and the state office of public health (see Chapter 79).

The colon lesions tested positive for WNV26 (Figure 41-7\n). Clinically, these animals appeared bloated and were unable to submerge in the water. This was likely the result of a blockage caused by the fibrous membrane in the colon. Affected animals in captive operations have ranged in age from 1 month to more than 12 months old. In younger animals, infection is usually severe and acute with as much as a 50% mortality rate. The pattern of deaths is usually seen as a sudden onset of mortalities followed by a peak and subsequent decline in the number of deaths. However, sporadic mortalities may also be seen, especially in older animals. No proposed treatments exist for WNV other than increasing hygiene to prevent the accumulation of feces. Once the infection runs its course, the surviving animals continue to thrive. Definitive diagnosis is best accomplished with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture of brain and spinal cord.

In a review of articles on crocodilian diseases, a fair number show lung lesions on necropsy. Respiratory signs can often be confused with neurologic signs, and a clear distinction must be established. On the other hand, respiratory disease may accompany neurologic disease as a consequence of weakness that leads to aspiration. Clinical signs associated with respiratory disease in crocodilians may include abnormal swimming (either in circles or on one side of the body), dyspnea, tachypnea, excessive basking, nasal discharge, and anorexia, among others. As these animals become weak, the basihyoid valve does not function properly and they can aspirate food or water. Because of the pharyngeal anatomy of crocodilians, aspiration is an unlikely event in healthy animals. Therefore, any evidence of it should be indicative of animals with an underlying illness. Most respiratory infections are either bacterial (Figure 41-8\n) or fungal in origin. A number of rhinitis and pharyngitis syndromes have also been described in some crocodilian species.11Fungal infections are perhaps not as commonly diagnosed but still need to be a consideration, especially for captive crocodilians. An early report showed a fungal pneumonia associated with Beauveria bassiana in two alligators,27 and Fusarium moniliforme was found in another case.28 Bacterial and fungal cultures should be obtained from the lungs in cases where respiratory disease is suspected. This allows a choice of appropriate treatment on the basis of sensitivity testing.",

Weakness, lethargy, kyphosis, scoliosis, paresis, tooth decalcification, and other skeletal abnormalities can be observed in crocodilians as well. Only a small number of these abnormalities are observed in most captive operations. Those affected may be runts of the group and have other concurrent disease. This is seen less often as better and improved diets are offered to captive crocodilians. Nonetheless, some operations still may offer no source of calcium in the diet. The innate requirement of ultraviolet B light as a source of vitamin D3 in crocodilians is not known. They appear to be able to obtain appropriate levels from their diet, but research in this area needs to be performed. The author has seen adult alligators raised in enclosed buildings and offered a pelleted diet with some meat supplement that show no evidence of metabolic disease. However, anecdotal comments from various ranchers indicate that the animals appear to thrive better if exposed to sunlight.",

Foreign body ingestion, gastric ulcers, enteritis (Figure 41-13\n), and trauma to the oral cavity can be observed in crocodilians. Ingestion of foreign bodies is more common in wild crocodilians. However, it must also be a differential in captive specimens. Malfunction of water pumps, water filters, or construction can lead to the presence of foreign bodies in the enclosures. These can then be ingested by the animals and cause severe problems in the case of nails and other sharp objects. A more common process is likely associated with infectious enteritis or septicemia. This is difficult to assess grossly because crocodilians have very thick intestines normally. However, crocodilians appear to have a characteristic response to insult of the gastrointestinal tract. Accumulation of fibrous material or necrotizing lesions is commonly seen on necropsy (Figure 41-14\n). This reaction is aggressive and can even lead to obstructions caused by the fibrous material itself. Obstruction can also occur with fecal impactions and torsions. Gastric ulcerations and abnormalities of the gastric mucosa are also routinely observed on necropsy and may be associated with stress and diet. Finally, the intestinal tract contains a large amount of Peyer's patches and likely represents a site of aggressive inflammatory response to infectious agents.",
