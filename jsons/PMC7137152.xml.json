The average annual increases in reported HIV infections and AIDS deaths are 15% and 25%, respectively,3 owing to low coverage of prevention and treatment efforts. The challenges are ever bigger than before, not because of political or financial factors, but technical and infrastructural ones. There are no easy solutions to solve the bottlenecks in the control programme\u2014such as how to find the more than 55% of unidentified HIV/AIDS patients among the national estimated total of 780 000; how to control sexual transmission effectively when sex education is still taboo and most men who have sex with men are married as a cover;4 how to fight discrimination where cultural beliefs and stigma prevent most doctors from operating on AIDS patients;5 and how to mobilise millions of medical personnel and non-governmental organisations for a comprehensive, unified war against AIDS, rather than just the solitary fight by the CDC system.",
