'This is only the second time in my 61 years of business that we've seen anything like this,' he said, adding that the first occasion was the aftermath of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in 2012\u2026. Hyatt said that the type of guns being bought was reflective of the fear prevalent among customers. There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles. Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: 'Financial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics \u2026 you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.'

That includes a $1 trillion request President Trump floated with Congress on Wednesday, which would provide direct payments to individuals and small businesses, along with aid for airlines and other affected industries\u2026. Payments to large companies could prove trickier. Many of the companies now asking for government support received a big corporate tax break from Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and have spent years returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. That has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accuse big companies of moving jobs out of the United States and putting shareholders ahead of workers, whose wages have risen only modestly since the last recession ended in 2009. The four biggest American airlines collectively bought back $39 billion in stock from 2015 to 2019 and paid out $6 billion in dividends, according to data from Capital IQ. The companies that make up the broader S&P 500 index spent more than $5 trillion in buybacks and dividends over that period.

Moreover, it is equally striking that many reject global interaction and connection-I'm not talking about neoliberal 'globalization' herewhile insisting on exploiting cheap labor. If these laborers are not brought into the country, will the crops not be picked, will Canadians not eat, will companies and farms go under?
