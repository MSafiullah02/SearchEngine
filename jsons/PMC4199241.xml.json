Due to the occurrence of more than 100 HRV serotypes with extensive sequence variability in the antigenic sites and the lack of animal models to test the efficacy of approaches to prevent or treat infection in vivo, no rhinovirus vaccines are available for use in humans. The lack of animal models has also limited the ability to conduct preclinical studies of antiviral compounds.",

Chimpanzees have been successfully infected with HRV14 and HRV43, and gibbons with HRV1A, HRV2, and HRV14, but no overt illness was observed in the infected animals 13, 14. Intracranial injections of virus into monkeys, hamsters, or baby mice did not result in either infection or disease 15, 16. Various BALB/c and C57/BL mouse models have been recently developed and utilized for the study of aspects of minor- and major-group HRV-induced disease 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. In both mouse models HRV infection was tested showing limited replication of the virus [17]. The recent work by Edlmyer et al., McLean et al., and Glanville et al. examined immunization of mice with recombinant rhinovirus capsid proteins 22, 23, 24 showing strong serological data suggesting cross protection. However their published data did not include proof of vaccine efficacy. Thus, no successful immunization/challenge/protection studies in any animal model have been reported. The availability of new experimental small animal model options is therefore still a major pressing need in the vaccinology field.",

For a quantitative assessment of viral replication, cDNA for the negative stranded viral RNA (as an indicator of active RNA transcription), was synthesized by priming with 5\u2032-CCCTTTCCCAAATGTAACTTAGAAGC-3\u2032.

A brief plateau of viral loads was detectable in the nose and trachea between 6\u201310 h p.i. followed by a decrease and clearance of virus.

Higher infectious virus titers were recovered from the lungs of animals infected with HRV16 than from animals infected with a similar dose of hRV1B, suggesting that the cotton rat is significantly more permissive to infection by HRV16.

Our data show that in contrast to the mouse, which requires genetic manipulation, the cotton rat appears to host infection and possibly replication of HRV16 in the URT and LRT. Although the data from examination of viral load in the respiratory tract over time is certainly compatible with a non-permissive model of infection and clearance of the inoculum over time, the differences observed between the course of infection by HRV16 and HRV1B together with the detection of (\u2212)vRNA in infected tissues suggest that HRV16 may be actually replicating in the cotton rat.

In our model of i.n. infection, the pulmonary infectious viral load is measurable within the 48 h following instillation and thus provides a powerful readout for assessment of protection by immunization and passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies. We found that i.m. inoculation of live virus but not UV-inactivated resulted in a significant decrease of viral loads in nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung of challenged animals suggesting that replication at the site of injection played a role in the resulting. A measurable protection against challenge was achieved with only one immunization (Fig. 3). The immunogenicity of the inoculum was likely dependent upon viral replication in the area of immunization since UV-inactivation of the virus completely abolished protection. The protection achieved with live virus was specific for HRV16 since no protection was conferred by immunization with live HRV1B. These results could be due to the apparent lack of replication of HRV1B in the cotton rat respiratory tract (data not shown), but are most likely the result of the lack of shared neutralizing epitopes between HRV16 and HRV1B. The spectrum of cross-reactivities of cotton rat anti-HRV16 neutralizing antibodies should be further investigated in view of the recent reports regarding the induction of in vitro cross-neutralizing antibodies after immunization with recombinant HRV14 and HRV89 VP1 [22], and the weak induction of HRV1B binding antibodies but not neutralizing antibodies in the mouse by immunization with HRV16 VP0 [23].",

In addition we demonstrated that passive transfer of antibodies generated in vaccinated cotton rats can protect na\u00efve animals from pulmonary infection. Thus, these results demonstrate that the cotton rat is a suitable animal model for challenge studies to explore the development of anti-rhinovirus vaccines and anti-viral therapies.",
