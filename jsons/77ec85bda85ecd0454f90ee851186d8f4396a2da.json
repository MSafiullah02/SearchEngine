Unfortunately, much of this work is undercompensated despite the proven efficacy of public health interventions such as hospital acquired infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, disease surveillance, and outbreak response. The lack of compensation makes it difficult to attract the best and the brightest to the field of ID, threatening the future of the ID workforce. Here, we examine compensation data for ID physicians compared to their value in population and public health settings and suggest policy recommendations to address the pay disparities that exist between cognitive and procedural specialties that prevent more medical students and residents from entering the field. All ID physicians should take an active role in promoting the value of the subspecialty to policymakers and influencers as well as trainees.",

ID physician salaries average around $100 000 a year less than other subspecialties [1, 2] . Young physicians, who generally complete training with substantial educational debt, can be driven from considering the field [1] . Developing a robust ID workforce of the future requires a strategy to attract quality physicians and keep them engaged on the frontline of patient care, research, and public health. Despite their documented value, ID physicians' services are undervalued by payers compared to primary care and procedure-based specialties. A graduating trainee finishing an internal medicine residency can work immediately as a hospitalist at a higher mean salary than an ID physician who will take 2 to 4 additional years of fellowship training. Such variances in compensation for direct patient care and insufficient pay for value in other roles such as infection control creates a significant disincentive to pursuing a career in ID.",

            "text": "The ID workforce plays a critical role in managing infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis, which can cause community outbreaks if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The public health workforce, including ID physicians, has been shrinking over the last decade [10, 11] . These workforce losses pose a significant barrier to carrying out routine public health activities and responding to public health threats. ID physicians employed by federal agencies and state health departments have the community as their patient. Along with ID physicians in other practice settings, they provide leadership and subject matter expertise to enable a wide variety of community-based interventions. For example, ID management and prevention. Public health strategies to contain the spread of HIV rely on ensuring that people living with HIV-AIDS have access to ID-driven clinical care. By achieving sustained virologic suppression, people stay healthy and reduce the risk of community transmission [12] . The 2015 HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) outbreaks linked to injection drug use in rural Scott County, Indiana, serve as a stark reminder of the risk for rapid disease transmission in communities that lack robust outbreak prevention resources and activities [13] . In 2017 there was an outbreak of hepatitis A virus in the homeless population of San Diego, California, that required significant work from the public health community to resolve [14] . In March 2017, a National Academies of Medicine panel declared the elimination of hepatitis B and HCV in the United States by 2030 to be a feasible goal. A sufficient workforce with the expertise to treat patients with HCV will be critical to reaching this goal [15] . As an example of outbreak detection and response to emerging infections, the Indiana State Health Department recognized the first identified case of MERS in the United States in a traveler to that state. ID specialists at the department helped develop and implement protocols to ensure appropriate care, prevent the spread of infection, and avert an outbreak. ID physicians working inside or outside of public health often provide guidance to help allocate community vaccine resources and other preventive services. For example, during measles outbreaks in California in 2015 and Minnesota in 2017, ID physicians within the state and local health departments helped lead vaccination campaigns to halt the spread of the disease [16, 17] . Even in the absence of a major outbreak, patients in hospitals and healthy individuals in communities are potentially exposed to increasingly drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens, necessitating ID physician leadership to protect the population by limiting the spread of infectious threats [18] . ID public health physicians act as a trusted resource, working through the media, to help educate the public about communicable diseases and prevention strategies. Current topics of concern include multidrug-resistant bacteria, Zika virus outbreaks, the 2017 hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego, and Mycobacterium chimera infections in patients treated with heart-lung bypass machines.",

During the West Africa Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015, ID physicians served as leaders of special biocontainment units at the National Institutes of Health, University of Nebraska, Emory University, and Bellevue Hospital. These units and their staff developed novel, sophisticated infection prevention strategies to care for patients with potentially deadly infections. They reassured medical providers, political leaders, and our nation's public by providing safe, state-of-the-art care. In Seattle, Washington, an ID physician reported an outbreak of deadly, multidrug-resistant carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections were attributed to contaminated, faulty duodenoscopes. This investigation helped lead to changes in guidance on endoscope reprocessing and safety [21, 22] . An ID physician at Vanderbilt University identified contaminated steroids as the source of a fungal meningitis outbreak that ultimately caused more than 700 infections and 46 deaths across 20 states before the cause was established [23, 24] .",

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant organisms kill more than 23 000 people and result in $20 billion in unnecessary healthcare costs each year in the United States [18] . Newer antimicrobials will be precious resources, and ID physician-driven expertise will be vital to ensure that they are being used appropriately. A recent Clinical Infectious Diseases article highlighted the unique skill set and training ID physicians have to lead antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in order to ensure that correct antimicrobials are used judiciously [25] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have acknowledged the impact and importance of ASPs in their release of the Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs in 2014 [26] , and the Joint Commission released their antimicrobial stewardship standard for healthcare settings in 2017. In 2014, legislation was passed in California that mandated that every acute care hospital in the state establish a physician-supervised ASP [27] . Adoption of a federal government requirement that other states follow suit would help to ensure that all patients can benefit from the positive impact of ASPs. ASPs will become increasingly vital in preventing a post-antibiotic era where common infections become untreatable due to resistant organisms. ID physicians need to take an active role in ensuring their facilities have adequate ASPs that meet the standards laid out by the CDC and Joint Commission. Well-run ASPs not only help preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials but also improve patient outcomes. In fact, studies have indicated that ASPs generated several hundred thousand dollars a year in cost savings while also reducing rates of Clostridium difficile infections [28, 29] . It is vital that the government continue to support the implementation of ID-led ASPs in all healthcare settings to slow the development of resistance and to keep our current antimicrobials useful for as long as possible.",

Natural disasters also carry an increased risk of outbreaks of unusual, serious infections, as seen in connection with the hurricanes and flooding in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, which led to more than 70 reported cases of leptospirosis and other waterborne and vectorborne diseases [30] . ID physicians also played a leading role in infection prevention at large-scale shelters for people who had been displaced by storms and flooding. Hospital and healthcare system emergency preparedness requires an intimate knowledge of hospital infection control procedures and capacities, regional collaboration with other facilities, planning with public health authorities, and development of communication strategies within the hospital community, with public health departments, and with the general public.",

            "text": "Establish loan repayment opportunities for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, or federal public health departments). Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response. Fully fund local, state, federal, and global public health agencies and build a competent workforce. Without proper workforce funding, including funding of ID physician positions, health departments will not be able to hire and retain the expert workforce necessary to detect, prevent, and respond to public health threats.",
