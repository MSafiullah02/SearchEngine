In this model a distinction was made between SARS transmission before and after an infected individual was hospitalized. We considered two qualitatively different strategies of antibody administration: first, pre-exposure prophylaxis targeted at susceptible persons coming into contact with hospitalized SARS cases (e.g. health care workers or close friends and relatives); and second, post-exposure prophylaxis targeted at exposed persons having been identified through contact tracing of hospitalized SARS cases. Based on our model, we derived an expression for the effective reproduction number of SARS to study conditions for containment and we explored how the size and duration of an outbreak depend on the efficacy of control.",

In addition, we suppose that those infected or removed constitute only a small fraction of the total population, i.e. S is taken to be approximately constant.

A modeling study aimed at simulating the potential response to SARS in Japan concluded that quarantine of the exposed population would be one of the most effective policy procedures.21 It has even been suggested that, despite the considerable costs involved, quarantine measures in Canada have not only saved lives but also costs.23 This impact of quarantine is remarkable given the lack of pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS. Within our modeling framework, the benefit of quarantining exposed individuals can only be interpreted in terms of admission interval reduction and contact rate reduction for any day prior to hospitalization. Our results are in line with the finding that personal protection measures in the general population (such as the use of facemasks) offer little protection to the community.26 We also demonstrate that patient isolation procedures alone will not prevent a SARS epidemic if the transmission rates are only slightly increased compared to the outbreaks in 2003, unless additional measures\u2014such as contact tracing\u2014are put in place. These findings are reminiscent of modeling results obtained for smallpox control.12, 26, 27\n",

As the etiologic agent of SARS continues to circulate in natural host species it may evolve into a more transmissible strain.10, 11 To maximize the opportunity of containment of potentially more transmissible SARS coronavirus variants, and to minimize the size and duration of an outbreak, existing control strategies should be supplemented with specific antiviral strategies. Passive immunization would seem appropriate in a contingency situation, as it can provide a person with instant albeit short-lived protection against infection and could also be used as a post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent disease progression. In rabies, passive immunization is commonly used in combination with vaccination to prevent rabies-exposed individuals from becoming symptomatic.28\n",

In (a), general control measures are chosen such that R=0.87. Supplemental measures may yield R=0.56 (b), R=0.44 (c) or R=0.20 (d), thus restricting both outbreak size and duration. Outbreak size is the cumulative number of persons infected, including the n=10 initial cases. Outbreak duration is the time until the last patient is discharged from hospital. The shaded area demarcates the 95th percentiles of outbreak size and duration.",
