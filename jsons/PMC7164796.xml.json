            "text": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is the most devastating consequence of an often remote measles infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis occurs almost exclusively in children and usually years after the primary measles infection. The long latency of its development, its aspecific presentation, and the fact that laboratory and imaging findings can be deceptively normal all make for a difficult diagnosis, and the disease is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late, only after a long list of differential diagnoses has been excluded. Once diagnosed, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is not easily treated, but progresses relentlessly until death. While subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cannot be cured, it can be prevented through measles vaccination, and it has become a very rare disease, most likely through the worldwide use of effective vaccines. Here, we report the case of an adult patient who was admitted to our hospital with a rapidly progressive encephalopathy and behavioural changes.",

Several infectious and autoimmune causes were investigated in cerebrospinal fluid and found to be negative: viral nucleic acid testing; herpes simplex virus 1 and 2; varicella zoster virus; enterovirus; parvovirus; fungal culture; Crypotoccus neoformans antigen testing; Gram stain; acid fast bacilli staining; bacterial and mycobacterial culture; antibodies against N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) NR1 subunit, leucine-rich, glioma inactivated-1 receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2 autoantigen, aquaporin-4, and the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GQ1b, and GT1b. Blood and urine cultures were negative for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. In view of her travel history, malaria thick and thin smears were done and were negative. Serological analyses involved tests for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (negative), Powassan virus (titre 1/20), chikungunya virus (IgM negative), Jamestown Canyon virus (IgM negative), snowshoe hare virus (IgM negative), dengue virus (IgM negative and IgG positive suggestive of remote infection), Japanese encephalitis virus (titre 1/80), Mycoplasm pneumoniae (IgM negative), rubella virus (IgM negative and IgG positive, 5\u00b76 IU/mL), West Nile virus (IgM negative and IgG positive with high avidity suggestive of remote infection), brucella (negative), Leptospira species (negative), and Orientia tsutsugamushi (negative). Nucleic acid testing for enterovirus, parechovirus, and West Nile virus viraemia was negative. Nucleic acid testing of the bronchial alveolar lavage specimens was negative for influenza A and B RNA, respiratory syncytial virus RNA, parainfluenza virus RNA, human metapneumovirus RNA, enterovirus RNA, rhinovirus RNA, human coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC42, HKU1) DNA, and adenovirus DNA.

The patient became hypoxic shortly afterwards because of an aspiration pneumonia; she was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit, and given broad spectrum antibiotics for possible infectious causes. She became comatose despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, rituximab, and antiseizure medications. At 31 weeks gestation, she developed hypertension and pre-eclampsia was suspected. Because of this complication, the child was delivered by emergency caesarean section. She was delivered of a healthy boy, and the hypertension resolved soon afterwards. She then developed acute tubular necrosis, which was confirmed with a renal biopsy, and was started on haemodialysis. She remained comatose and repeat cranial MRI showed diffuse hyperintensity in the brainstem and cerebral cortex, brain oedema, and brain herniation (figure 1).

Diffuse encephalitis with associated astrocytic gliosis and neuropil loss was present in multiple areas of the cortex and thalamus. The brain had numerous eosinophilic viral inclusions, which were both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the intranuclear inclusion bodies comprised viral nucleocapsid filaments typical of paramyxoviruses (figure 2\n). Results of RT-PCR testing showed strongly positive results for measles virus. The virus strain was classified as a genotype D6 by genotyping done at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Results from sequencing of the virus at the Alberta Provincial Laboratory in Calgary, AB, Canada, showed that there were several mutations in the wild-type virus consistent with previously described mutations in cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.1 The autopsy revealed a left breast fibroadenoma and uterine changes secondary to the patient's pregnancy and caesarean section. The kidneys were autolytic; no viral inclusions were identified. No noteworthy pathological changes were identified in other organ systems.",

A detailed clinical discussion was published in 2005.2 Major causes include infections, autoimmune disease, and neoplasm. Infectious causes include viral encephalitides caused by varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enteroviruses, and arbovirus infections (such as West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis), and rabies. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by the papova virus known as the John Cunningham virus, which typically affects patients with HIV and other patients who are immunocompromised. Infective endocarditis can have cerebral involvement through cerebral embolism. Autoimmune disorders such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral lupus, Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, and primary cerebral angiitis can present as a progressive encephalopathy. Neoplastic disorders such as leptomeningeal metastasis of solid tumours, CNS lymphoma, and rarely intravascular lymphoma (angioendotheliomatosis) could lead to similar presentations and sequelae.",

Primary measles encephalitis affects one to three in 1000 patients with measles. The underlying pathophysiology seems to be a primary viral infection of CNS, because the cerebrospinal fluid usually has high titres of measles antibodies.4 Vaccination and primary encephalitis are not clearly related; investigators of a case series from 1963 to 1971 reported only 45 cases of primary encephalitis within 6\u201315 days of vaccination out of 50\u00b79 million doses.5 Furthermore, findings from a prospective 14 year follow-up study from 1982 to 1996 showed that four of 1\u00b78 million individuals had neurological complications attributed to the measles vaccine. Two cases of measles encephalitis after vaccination were reported in patients who were immunocompromised and two other infants younger than 1 year developed encephalitis 9\u201313 days after vaccination that could not be attributed to any specific cause.6\n",

One of the 11 reported cases (diagnosed in Glasgow, UK in 1999) was caused by the genotype D6 isolate, the same genotype found in the patient described in this Grand Round. Genotype D6 is known to be responsible for outbreaks of disease in many European countries from 1996\u20132002.20 A review12 in 2002 assessed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases in the USA. Among the PCR-proven cases, genotype D3 viral subtype was the most prevalent, followed by several cases of genotype E. Genotype D6 had not been reported in Canada since 1997,21 and has not been seen anywhere in the world since 2007,22 which supports our contention that our patient was infected decades ago.",

However, such research is difficult in view of the rarity of the disease, and its results should be regarded as hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory of genetic susceptibility. The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) gene is thought to contribute to genetic susceptibility to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. A statistically significant difference in PD-1 gene polymorphisms has been found in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and healthy controls in Turkey.26 PD-1 is a co-inhibitory molecule and a member of the CD28 family that acts as a negative immunomodulator in the suppression of T lymphocytes.27 Results from a study28 from Japan suggest that mutations in toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) are positively associated with the disease. TLR3 recognises the dsRNA of measles virus and triggers the immunological cascade that results in the production of type 1 interferon, which is important for viral clearance.28 Mutations in TLR3 are proposed to decrease the recognition of measles virus and the production of interferon. Mutations in the sodium channel \u03b1-1 subunit gene, which are implicated in epilepsy, are thought to increase cerebral neuron vulnerability to measles infection.29\n",

Most case reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis are described in non-vaccinated patients; however, similar to the patient described in this paper, some reports describe cases of the disease despite adequate vaccination.35, 36 A 7-year-old patient had rapid onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis with a documented vaccination history of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination at 15 months. The patient was presumed to have been exposed to measles before his vaccination, which might have been the case in our patient.35 Alternatively vaccine failure has been reported in a small number of patients, who were typically immunised before 12 months of age and did not seroconvert.37\n",

The most recent case report46 describes two 20-year-old patients with similar clinical signs and biochemical and radiological investigations to the patient described here. The diagnosis of presumed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was made on the basis of clinical judgment of the care providers and the patients were treated; one patient was given interferon alfa-2b for 5 weeks and the other was given intrathecal interferon alfa-2 and inosinepranobex for 8 weeks; no clear benefits were seen before both patients succumbed to illness. Most other reported cases were not diagnosed until after death; most patients were treated for a presumed infectious and paraneoplastic encephalopathy. Only two case reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in pregnancy presented with typical symptoms: a 30-year-old woman at 30 weeks' gestation (pregnant three times, with one livebirth) and a 27-year-old woman at 24 weeks' gestation (pregnant once, with one livebirth).2, 41 Both patients presented with visual symptoms and subsequently developed confusion, hemianopia, and focal seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid test results showed expected pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. Findings from EEGs in both cases showed non-specific slowing and no radiological abnormalities in MRI. Despite the typical presentation, both cases presented diagnostic challenges and were treated empirically for infectious and inflammatory causes. At autopsy, both patients tested positive for the measles genotype D1 isolate.",

Authors of a review53 from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in India show that an accurate initial diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was only made in 21% of cases. Attempts to formulate diagnostic criteria for the disease have been made; however, the gold standard for diagnosis is a positive brain biopsy suggestive of panencephalitis. Measles antibody detection using indirect immunofluorescent assay has been successful in establishing cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratios.37, 54 Cerebrospinal fluid analysis for both anti-measles virus IgG titres and intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific IgG index is diagnostic for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.37, 54 Intrathecal synthesised IgG is typically markedly elevated with oligoclonal bands; however, IgG might not be solely specific for measles virus but to other viruses at lower titres. Detection of anti-measles IgM in cerebrospinal fluid has been suggested to lead to an extended course of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles RNA is rarely identified, but it is diagnostic for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.37, 54 Investigators of one study55 found that patients with the disease had cerebrospinal fluid-to-serum ratios between 1:80 and 1:5. This represents the antibody index, which calculates the cerebrospinal fluid-to-serum antibody ratio that could differentiate between blood-derived and brain-derived pathogenesis. Normalisation of cerebrospinal fluid-to-serum ratios that account for albumin and total IgG has been introduced to improve the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.56, 57 Cerebrospinal fluid was not tested for measles-specific antibody in the patient described in this paper, but the measles IgG titre in serum was relatively high in the absence of a reported recent infection or vaccination; in hindsight this result might have been a clue to the diagnosis.",

Since the introduction of the measles vaccine, the disease has become exceedingly rare in North America. In Alberta, Canada, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis became reportable in 1983 and six cases were reported between 1983 and 1994. A monovalent live measles vaccination programme was introduced in Alberta in July, 1970, and the universal infant MMR programme was introduced in 1982.67 The MMR second dose campaign for children aged 4\u20136 years was introduced in 1996 and a catch-up programme (age 14\u201315 years) was introduced between 1997 and 1998.68 In India, an immunisation programme was introduced in 1978 as a WHO Expanded Programme of Immunization initiative.69 This programme gained momentum in 1985, and was expanded in a phased manner to become a universal immunisation programme covering all districts by 1990. The programme consisted of seven vaccines for preventable diseases, including measles. Two doses of measles vaccine were given to children at age 9\u201312 months and a second dose at 15\u201318 months.69 A dose of MMR at 5 years of age can be recommended depending on the district. Measles deaths in India decreased from 106 000 in 2005 to 65 000 in 2010 after a measles catch-up campaign that provided vaccination for 135 million children.70 In Japan, the addition of a mass immunisation campaign in 1982 resulted in a gradual reduction in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases from 24 cases reported in 1981 to 15 in 1985.66 Similar trends have been reported in Israel.14 These findings emphasise the importance of herd immunity in the maintenance of a population free of measles, because infants are susceptible to measles infection until the MMR vaccination can be given at 12 months old.",
