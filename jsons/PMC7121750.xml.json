It also is used to avoid endotracheal intubation (ETI) and its resulting complications, such as infections associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), increased risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and economic cost. Thus, NIV has been used under the following conditions.Evidence level 1\u2014derived from systematic reviews with randomized homogeneity-controlled trials (RCTs) and individual controlled trials with a narrow confidence gap. Here, NIV is used to treat COPD exacerbations or ACPO, to facilitate weaning/extubation from IMV in patients with COPD, and for acute respiratory failure (ARF) of immunocompromised patients.Evidence level 2\u2014derived from systematic reviews with homogeneity of cohort studies, individual cohorts, and/or poor-quality RCTs. NIV is applied in patients with a \u201cdo not intubate\u201d order, as a palliative measure in terminally ill patients, to prevent extubation failure in patients with COPD or heart failure, for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in COPD patients, to prevent and treat postoperative respiratory failure, and to prevent ARF due to asthma. Also in this category, but with greater caution and according to the case, NIV may be indicated for severe CAP and for preventing extubation failure in patients without COPD.Evidence level 3\u2014derived from systematic reviews with homogeneity of case\u2013control studies and an individual case\u2013control study. NIV is suggested for neuromuscular diseases and kyphoscoliosis, partial obstruction of the upper airway, thoracic trauma, and treatment of ARF in patients with asthma. With more caution and strict surveillance, NIV may also be indicated for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Evidence level 4\u2014derived from case series and poor-quality cohort and case\u2013control studies. NIV is suggested for obesity-related hypoventilation, cystic fibrosis, and in the elderly (>75 years) with ARF. With greater caution and according to the case, it is also indicated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
