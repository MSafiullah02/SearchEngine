These electric and magnetic fields are predominantly of low frequency (60 Hz in the US, 50 Hz in Europe and Japan) and generally of low intensity. Electric fields exist when there is electric potential in a line, while magnetic fields exist only when there is current flow (1). Since both electric and magnetic fields often occur together and are interactive, these fields have often been referred to as electric and magnetic fields or EMFs. Electric fields are easily shielded by trees, walls and other objects while magnetic fields usually penetrate non-ferrous material. Thus, most residential exposure is to magnetic fields. More recent research has focused on potential adverse biological effects of exposure to magnetic fields. The residential exposures in most homes are to magnetic field intensities of <2 milligauss (mG) which is equivalent to 0.2 microtesla (\u03bcT) although some areas in homes may exceed this field intensity. In certain industrial settings, mean workplace magnetic field exposure may exceed 10 mG (2).",

While male breast cancer is rare, any effect of EMF on the incidence of breast cancer in women has potential major health implications. Furthermore, the suggestion that magnetic field exposure may depress nocturnal melatonin levels (6) provided a plausible mechanism for alterations in breast cancer rates.",

Each coil set consisted of four pairs of vertically oriented coils connected in series, which were spaced on each system. Pairs of coils were stacked one above the other; the bottom coils produced horizontal magnetic fields in one direction while the top coils produced magnetic fields opposite to those of the lower coils. This arrangement helped minimize stray fields. The wires in the coils were embedded in plastic to minimize coil vibration and hum and the plastic cases of the coils could be cleaned without danger of harming the electrical hardware. The electrical power was supplied by a Techron Model 7570 power supply amplifier via condensers that served as power factor correctors. This arrangement tuned the coils to the exposure frequency (50 or 60 Hz). The coils were wired in series and collectively presented an electrical resistance of ~8 \u03a9 and an inductance of ~240 millihenrys. Generation of the 5 G field required 4.5 A at 415 V on the coils producing ~200 W of heating.",

The coprocessor collected data and stored it on the computer hard drive with a backup tape run each day. Emdex II field data logging units (Enertech Consultants), were used to monitor the ambient field levels for the control animals. Field levels in the exposure rooms were checked every 6 min during the 26 week study and were triggered to alarm when fields were 10% out of target field intensities.

On day 1 of the study, four groups of 130 female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (100 core and 30 special study) were administered, by gavage, 10 mg DMBA dissolved in 1 ml of sesame oil. Of the four groups administered DMBA, one group received no magnetic field exposure and served as a DMBA control group. An additional 130 female rats were administered 1 ml of sesame oil on day 1 of the study. These rats received no magnetic field exposure and served as a vehicle control group. Three groups of rats administered DMBA were exposed to magnetic fields at intensities/frequencies of 1 G 50 Hz, 5 G 50 Hz or 1 G 60 Hz for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week for 26 weeks. The rats for melatonin studies were the special study animals and were killed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of exposure/sham exposure and will be reported separately. Rats were weighed prior to study start, weekly thereafter and again at necropsy. The rats were palpated weekly; masses were located by specific mammary gland (L1\u2013L6 and R1\u2013R6). Two individuals each palpated half of the rats each week, alternating groups of rats. Size was determined by comparing the masses with wooden spheres of defined size. When there was a discrepancy between the previous week in number or size of the masses, then both individuals palpated the animal and resolved the discrepancy. At the time of necropsy, the clinical observations were available to the pathologist; additional masses were found at necropsy. The skin and mammary glands were removed and placed on a light box to visualize the tumors. Masses were measured in two directions and collected in the formalin. The lung, liver, kidney and all masses were fixed in formalin, stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined histologically. Each gross lesion was uniquely identified and followed through processing; histological diagnoses were correlated with each gross lesion identified in the mammary gland. The measurements at necropsy were used to calculate the area of the mammary gland carcinomas for each group.",
