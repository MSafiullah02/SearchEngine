            "text": "Plant essential oils are known for their multiple uses in perfumery, as preservatives and antimicrobials, which are commonly extracted from leaves, branches, roots, stems, fruits and seeds of aromatic plants [1]. The plant essential oil is a mixture of various components from plants. According to the different chemical structures of the essential oil, the composition can be divided into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, esters, aldehydes and ketones. The constituents are very complex which are involved in the defense of the plant against pests, herbivores, fungi, and bacteria [2], [3]. Essential oils have many applications in indigenous medicines, food flavouring and preservation as well as in drug and cosmetic industries [4]. It also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor and other functions [5], [6]. Due to thetoxicological effect of the synthetic products, renewed efforts were provided in respect of the use of essential oils as natural antioxidants and preservatives in the food processing, food supplement production andpharmaceutical industry [7].",

Because of medicinal importance and intricate chemical composition of several species and chemotypes, Artemisia continues to be a subject of wide interest for chemists and taxonomists [8], [9], [10].

In another study, it was reported that this standardized extract of A. asiatica (which was called as DA-9601) showed chemopreventive effects against azoxymethane-initiated and dextran sulphate sodium-promoted mouse colon cancer. DA-9601 also led to the suppression of COX-2 expression and also inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B DNA binding in the colonic tissues [16]. The essential oil composition of A. asiatica has already been reported as well as its antibacterial and antifungal activity against a range of microbial strains [12]. However, its mode of action with regard to its antibacterial action has not been studies so far. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essentialoil on several respiratory infection causing bacteria and tofurther evaluate the antibacterial mechanism against Haemophilus influenzaeby growth curve, the integrity of cellmembrane assays, the SDS-PAGE and SEM examination. Using the above assays, we expect to provide some scientific rationale for developing and utilizing this medical plant.",

Oxygenated monoterpenes were found to be the dominant class of terpenes, followed by the monoterpene hydrocarbons.

Asiatica are presented in Table 2\n. The results showed that the essential oil showed some antibacterial effect against all the tested bacteria including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In order to determine the antibacterial spectrum of the essential oil, 3 well-known standard drugs viz., Penicillin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin were used as positive controls. The results revealed that essential oil of A. asiatica exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the various microbial strains. The essential oil showed maximum growth inhibition against Haemophilus influenzae with a zone of inhibition of 24.5 mm and MIC/MBC values of 1.9/4.5 mg/mL respectively. However, the essential oil showed lowest growth inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosawith a zone of inhibition of 9.2 mm and MIC/MBC values of 5.8/9.4 mg/mL respectively. This is not unexpected because Pseudomonas aeruginosais a Gram negativebacteria which usually are resistant to most of the drugs used. The MIC/MBC values of the essential oil indicated that the antibacterial activity of the oil is somehow comparable to the standard positive controls. MIC was the minimum essential oil concentration that can prevent the bacteria from obvious growth. MBC was the lowest concentration of the essential oil that could kill the inoculum bacteria [21]. Thus from zone of inhibition values and MIC/MBC values, it was shown that Haemophilus influenza was the most affected bacteria, therefore further mechanistic studies were done on this bacterial strain.",

On the contrary the bacteria treated with the essential oil led to a rapid decrease in the number of viable cells. The growth of bacteria was suppressed by the essential oil. In the treatments (1\u00d7MIC) showed a slow decrease in bacterial number over the first 12 h period of the test.

The leakage of proteins at the start in the untreated control was much lower as compared to the leakage of proteins treated with A. asiatica essential oil. The leakage of the proteins at 1 h incubation was 0.5 \u03bcg/mL in the untreated control, while as the leakage of proteins increased to 2.4 \u03bcg/mL (1 x MIC) and 3.8 \u03bcg/mL (2 x MIC).

The different kinds of upper respiratory tract infections include the cold, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis etc [22]. The main contributing factors towards these nasty infections are the infections caused by certain bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. Some viruses like coronavirus, para influenza virus etc can also cause certain types of upper respiratory tract infections [23], [24]. Many of the bacterial strains have acquired resistance against the commonly used antibiotics resulting in limited efficacy of these drugs. As such there is an urgent need for novel, promising and cheap antimicrobial drugs which do not develop resistance easily against these microbes. Essential oils have wide range of applications in medicine and aromatherapy owing to their multiple chemical constituents in their mixtures giving rise to multifunctionality. Essential oils have been reported to exhibit antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacterial strains [25]. It has been reported that traditionally essential oils and their constituents have been used for the treatment of various upper respiratory tract infections including colds. Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been successfully used to treat acute disorders like sinusitis, acute and chronic bronchitis and even for reducing the tracheal inflammation [26], [27], [28], [29].",

Our results are well in agreement with previous which have reported the essential oil of other Artemisia species to exert significant antimicrobial activities [30].

Furthermore the results showed that on adding the essential oil of A. asiatica to the bacterial culture, the constituents of the bacterial cell got released into the medium and this cell constituent release increased with increasing doses of the essential oil. SEM investigations revealed that the essential oil treatment led to damaged cell wall, deformed cell morphology, shrunken cells and also caused DNA damage. The damage to the bacterial cells seemed to enhance with increasing doses of the essential oil. Our results are information with previous studies wherein essential oils have been reported to inhibit cell wall synthesis via interaction with a number of cellular enzymes [31], [32]. Besides, essential oils have also been reported to induce DNA damage in bacterial cells and hence further confirming our results [33]. Given the promising results of the present study, we believe that further in vivo investigation should be carried out on the essential of A. asiatica to establish it as an important antimicrobial agent.",
