Wu et al., 2020a), and only one study tested treated wastewater that resulted positive (Paris) (Wurtzer et al., 2020). We observed discrepancies among RT-qPCR N1, N2 and N3 assays for several water samples in agreement to a previous report (Medema et al., 2020). This could be due to the different analytical sensitivity among the assays as well as the detection of possible false positive samples by RT-qPCR N3 in low concentrated clinical samples (Jung et al., 2020; Vogels et al., 2020). The latter possibility has been solved by excluding the N3 primers/probe set from the US CDC 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR diagnostic panel in its last revision (March, 30) (CDC a, CDC b, n.d.). In addition, a partial inhibitory effect of the matrix is not to be completely excluded despite the controls included in the assays. A more sensitive estimation of SARS-CoV-2 loads in wastewater should be studied by digital RT-qPCR (dRT-qPCR). dRT-qPCR could be used to quantify samples with low viral loads as reported for norovirus in wastewater (Monteiro and Santos, 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples (Dong et al., 2020; Suo et al., 2020), even though it may not be the best practical and economically sustainable option for environmental surveillance (Abachin et al., 2018).",

The early detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater could have alerted about the imminent danger, giving a valuate time to the managers to coordinate and implement actions to slow the spread of the disease. Therefore, our outcomes support that WBE could be used as an early warning tool to monitor the status of COVID-19 infection within a community.",

For instance, a key question is how to reduce the risk of a \u201csecond wave\u201d and/or recurring local outbreaks. Massive population tests are the first choice, but in their absence, wastewater monitorization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can give a reliable picture of the current situation. Our wastewater data do not quantitatively resemble the prevalence of COVID-19 confirmed cases. To this end, a quantitative model that includes and corrects all the variables affecting these wastewater surveillance data would be useful for a better interpretation. For instance, not all COVID-19 positive patients excrete SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces, and when it occurs, the titers and the duration of shedding vary among individuals and across time (He et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). On the other hand, the real number of positive cases within the Murcia Region remains unknown because of the large number of mild or asymptomatic carriers that have not been included in epidemiological statistics.",
