The lack of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 in this study is surprising but is not conclusive of their absence. Because of year to year variation,13 circulation during the study period may have been minimal. Surveillance encompassing all seasons over several years would aid in this regard. The presence of HCoV-HKU1 genetic sequences in stool samples from patients with gastrointestinal illness suggests this coronavirus may play a role in enteric disease. However, causality cannot be addressed through our study's design. Prospective, population-based studies are required.",

Further studies including an asymptomatic control group and paired respiratory sample analysis is warranted. In addition, by selecting specimens acquired through the core laboratories of the regional referral hospital, a bias towards finding individuals with more severe disease may occur. Investigations focusing on mild gastroenteritis outside the hospital should be undertaken. Despite these shortcomings, the paucity of individuals who screened positive for coronavirus suggests that these viruses likely play a minor role in human gastroenteritis requiring medical evaluation.",
