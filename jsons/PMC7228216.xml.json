The genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), which encode for non\u2010structural (NS) and structural (VP) proteins (Cotmore et al., 2019; Reed, Jones, & Miller, 1988). Interestingly, the virus has a rapid mutation rate, similar to those observed in RNA viruses (Decaro et al., 2009; Shackelton, Parrish, Truyen, & Holmes, 2005). CPV\u20102 first emerged in the late 1970s through a host\u2010switching event of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) (Appel et al., 1979). Since first emerging, mutations of the VP2 gene have generated the antigenic variants CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b and CPV\u20102c, which soon replaced the original CPV\u20102 virus worldwide (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Miranda & Thompson, 2016; Parrish et al., 1991; Parrish, O'Connell, Evermann, & Carmichael, 1985). These variants have different biological properties from the original CPV\u20102 virus and can infect cats and proliferate in feline cell lines (Truyen & Parrish, 1992).",

A retrospective analysis described circulation of CPV\u20102c in Germany already in 1996 (Decaro et al., 2007). Currently, the CPV\u20102c variants are distributed worldwide, including Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, and North and South America (Miranda & Thompson, 2016; Woolford, Crocker, Bobrowski, Baker, & Hemmatzadeh, 2017). In the 2000s, this variant was found with high frequency in Europe and South America, but was relatively rare in Asia, where CPV\u20102a was predominant (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2012). However, the distribution of CPV\u20102c has since expanded, and it has recently been found in Asia including China (Geng et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017), Taiwan (Chiang, Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Lin, 2016; Lin et al., 2017), Vietnam (Hoang et al., 2019), Laos (Vannamahaxay et al., 2017), Mongolia (Temuujin et al., 2019) and Thailand (Charoenkul et al., 2019).",

In addition, the genetic divergent properties of CPV\u20102 in South America resulted from the migration of CPV\u20102 originating from other continents during the last two decades (Grecco et al., 2018; Miranda & Thompson, 2016; Perez et al., 2014).",

Recently, CPV\u20102c has been also found more frequently in Asia. Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile and Gln370Arg are among the most frequently observed mutations in the VP2 gene of Asian\u2010origin CPV\u20102c variants (China, Laos, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam), and were also identified in the present study. Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile and Thr440Ala are also frequently detected in CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b worldwide, including Asia, and may contribute to antigenic drift that results in immune escape and vaccination failure (Geng et al., 2015). Gln370Arg was first observed in CPV\u20102c recovered from a giant panda in China in 2014 (Guo et al., 2013). The residue is located between residues 359 and 375, which are part of a flexible loop dependent on pH and Ca2+ levels. Mutations in this loop may result in a change in host range (canine or feline), and the haemagglutination of host erythrocytes (Simpson et al., 2000). Taken together, although the role of these residues needs to be further elucidated, these mutated residues may provide a survival advantage, allowing CPV\u20102c to adapt to a new host or environment.",

            "text": "In the present study, unique mutations were found scattered throughout the Korea CPV\u20102c strain genomes. Analysis of NS1 mutations among global CPV\u20102 variants has so far been limited. Korea CPV\u20102c_2 harboured two unique mutations (Thr70Pro and Cys287Tyr) in NS1, which is essential for viral replication and host apoptosis. Apoptosis is typically a host defence mechanism against harmful agents; however, some studies have demonstrated that cell death and cell cycle arrest are beneficial to the virus in parvovirus\u2010infected cells, aiding in viral DNA replication and nuclear egress (Chen & Qiu, 2010). Two mutations in the VP1 region were observed in Korea CPV\u20102c_1 (Lys17Arg and Leu33Phe). These mutations are located in unique region of VP1, which is responsible for nuclear transport and phospholipase A2 activity during cell infection (Vihinen\u2010Ranta, Wang, Weichert, & Parrish, 2002). Unique mutations in VP2, Gln365His in Korea CPV\u20102c_2 and Ala516Val in Korea CPV\u20102c_1, were reported in this study for the first time. Residue 365 is also located with residues 370 and 375 in the flexible loop that determines host range. Therefore, these mutations may contribute to host range extension (Simpson et al., 2000). The substitution at residue 516, Ala516Thr, has been reported as a specific mutation in Hungarian CPV\u20102 (Csagola, Varga, Lorincz, & Tuboly, 2014). Continuous monitoring of the genetic characteristics of Korean CPV\u20102 is therefore necessary for effective disease control.",

The Korean CPV\u20102c strains possess mutations distinct from those observed in CPV\u20102c strains of other countries. Based on their phylogenetic divergence, the Korean CPV\u20102c strains clustered with CPV strains of Asian origin. These results suggest that CPV\u20102c was potentially introduced into South Korea by the transport of dogs and/or fomites contaminated with CPV\u20102c from neighbouring Asia countries.",
