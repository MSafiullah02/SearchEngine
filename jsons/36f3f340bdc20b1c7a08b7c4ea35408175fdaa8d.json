We systematically optimized the setup, and the detection volume reached about 0.7 fL.

Using quantum dots (745 nm emission wavelength) and Rhodamine B (580 nm emission wavelength) as labeling probes and 532 nm laser beam as an excitation source, the cross-talk effect was almost completely suppressed. The molecule numbers in a highly focused volume, the concentration, and the diffusion time and hydrodynamic radii of the reaction products can be determined by FCCS system.",

Single wavelength laser FCCS was successfully realized due to the use of unique optical property of quantum dots. Quantum dots can be excited at a wide wavelength range since they have broad absorption spectra. In this study, QD745 can be excited by 532 nm laser, and the maximum emission wavelength is at 745 nm. The photoluminescence spectra of Rhodamine B and QD745 as well as the transmission spectral curves of the filter and mirror are shown in Fig. 2 . The 610-nm dichroic mirror was used to split the fluorescence. The light in channels 1 and 2 were filtered by a 565 WB 20 band-pass filter and 700 nm longpass filter. In this case, the cross-talk effect was nearcompletely suppressed. The results indicated that the fluorescence intensity ratio of Rhodamine B in channel 2 to channel 1 was 1/12 and the fluorescence intensity ratio of QD745 in the channel 1 to the channel 2 was 1/80. Figure 3 shows the correlation curves of immune complex including three curves. Curve 1 is the fluorescence autocorrelation curve of Rhodamine B, curve 2 is the fluorescence autocorrelation curve of QD745 and curve 3 is the FCCS curve of immune complex.",

The structure parameter z 0 /\u03c9 0 were determined using 1.0\u00c210 -8 mol/L Rhodamine 6G, assuming its diffusion constant of D = 2.8\u00c210 -6 cm 2 /s in water. The recording time was 30 s repeated 11 times. The data were plugged into formula 2. The obtained \u03c9 0 and z 0 were 0.26 \u03bcm and 1.89 \u03bcm, and their RSDs were 0.8 % and 5.6 % (n = 11) respectively. The detection volume in channel 1 was 0.7 fL according to the formula V eff \u00bc \u03c0 3=2 \u03c9 2 0 z 0 [7] . Since it is very difficult to find a conventional organic dye whose excitation wavelength is 532 nm and emission wavelength is more than 700 nm, the above method cannot be used to measure the detection volume in channel 2. Instead, we used an indirect method to measure the detection volume in channel 2. In detail, Rhodamine B was first used to determine the detection volume on a 590-nm long-pass filter in the same method as the method described above. Afterwhich, the Rhodamine B sample was replaced by QD745; the number of particles was recorded in the same condition. Last, 590 nm long-pass filter was replaced by 700 nm long-pass filter; the number of QD745 particles was recorded again. Based on the ratio of the particle numbers in twice measurements, the volume in channel 2 could be obtained indirectly to be 1.5 fL.",

The molecular number in the detection volume is 0.4-10. This data illustrated that our FCCS system was an effective one. The Normalized FCCS curves are shown in Fig. 5 , which were obtained by normalized treatment from Fig. 4 .
