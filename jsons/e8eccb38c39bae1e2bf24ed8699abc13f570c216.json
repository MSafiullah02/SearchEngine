            "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as a 2019-nCoV disease , is continuously increasing. The virus, which can easily be transmitted person-to-person (possibly by people without symptoms) and has already reached 4 continents, currently represents the major public health problem. 1 , 2 The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a spectrum of respiratory illness, from asymptomatic to fatal pneumonia, and the risk factors for exacerbation remain largely unknown. It is speculated that virus replication has an essential role in inflammatory process. 1 , 3 Based on previous experiences ( SARS outbreak in 2003), lopinavir/ritonavir might be used for treating SARS-CoV2 replication; however, its effectiveness remains controversial. 4 , 5 Arbidol is another antiviral agent that has been approved in China and Russia for treating influenza, SARS, and Lassa viruses. 6 , 7 A limited number of case reports showed that patients with COVID-19 successfully recovered after receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol treatment 8 , 9 ; however, it is difficult to prove whether they were cured by the antiviral agent or just a natural course of COVID-19. 5 Recently, Xia reported that combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol may likely be preferred in a retrospective study with a small sample size. 10 To evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with COVID-19.",
