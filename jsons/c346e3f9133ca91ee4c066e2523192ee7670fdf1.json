The former were based upon industry and social class, upon welfare states and upon the distribution of various goods (as opposed to bads) organized and distributed through the state, especially of good health, extensive education, and equitable forms of social welfare. There were state-organized societies, there was a national community of fate, and there were large-scale political movements especially based upon industrial class divisions that fought over the distribution of their various goods. In the post-Second World War period in Western Europe, there was a welfare state settlement in such industrial societies based upon achieving a fairer distribution of such goods.",

Risk societies involve the distribution of bads that flow within and across various territories and are not confined within the borders of a single society. Nuclear radiation is a key example of this, but also financial risks, global warming, SARS 3 and so forth. These risks cannot be confined to any scientific space nor to any current sector of time. Such risks thus cannot be insured against. They are uncontrolled and the consequences are incalculable. This argument about the borderlessness of the risk society has (together with the writings of many others) developed the analysis of globalization implications for sociology. Since then, I have given particular attention to the nature and limitation of methodological nationalism. What does this mean and what is wrong with it?",

Where social actors subscribe to this belief, I talk of a national outlook; where it determines the perspective of the social scientific observer, I talk of methodological nationalism. The distinction between the perspective of the social actor and that of the social scientist is crucial, because there is only a historical connection between the two, not a logical one. This historical connection-between social actors and social scientists-alone gives rise to the axiomatics of methodological nationalism. Methodological nationalism is neither a superficial problem nor a minor error. It involves both the routines of data collection and production as well as the basic concepts of modern sociology and political science-concepts such as society, social class, state, family, democracy, international relations etc.",

American sociology, in particular, developed in this way, presuming that all societies were more or less like that of the USA, just poorer! It was perfectly possible to study that particular society and then to generalize as though all, or at least most, other societies (at least those that mattered!) were much the same. This led to debates about the general nature of order or of conflict within 'society' based upon the distinct US pattern. Order and conflict theories were to be 'tested' within the USA and it was presumed that these conclusions could then be generalized to all societies or, at least, to all rich industrial societies. For decades it was simply how sociology worked; it was a taken-for-granted way of doing sociology-then 'global studies' marched in.",

The initial denial is over because the theoretical and empirical refinement revealed a new social landscape in the making (see for many Held et al. 1999) . Its dominant features include interconnectedness, which means dependency and interdependency of people across the globe. Virtually the entire span of human experiences and practices is in one way or another influenced by the overwhelming interconnectivity of the world. (This should not be confused with world system and dependency theories.) The third phase uncovers the core unseen and unwanted consequence of this global interconnectivity: really existing cosmopolitization-the end of the 'global other'. The global other is here in our midst. This is precisely my point: to clearly distinguish between philosophical cosmopolitanism and social scientific cosmopolitization.",

What goes towards making a 'good society', a 'good family' (a 'good woman', a 'good man', a 'good child', etc.)? All social and moral orders hitherto had, implicitly at least, answers befitting their own age or aspiring to universal validity. Reflexive cosmopolitization casts doubt on these claims in two ways: on the one hand, the regime of the Either/Or had traditionally set territorial limits to the contradictions of particular universalist claims to a 'good life', a 'good society', and a 'good religion' and in so doing, defused them. In the age of cosmopolitization, this world of clear distinctions and classifications now disappears. It follows that today in the everyday encounters between world religions the claims to universal validity of the two major cultures of Europe-the culture of Christianity and the culture of secular modernity-no longer hold water. The same may be said of the particularist universalist claims of other religions, such as Islamist universalism ('Ummah'). Thus it is not just the case that religious differences become sources of conflict; over and above that, in the cosmopolitan constellation, we are witnessing the implosion of contextually defined universalisms and national and ethical certitudes along with them. Hence the outburst of neo-nationalism and the emergence of a democratic racism in the midst of societies everywhere.",

The 'legitimation' of global inequalities is based on an institutionalized 'looking the other way'. The national gaze is 'freed' from looking at the misery of the world. It operates by way of a double exclusion: it excludes the excluded. And the social science of inequality, which equates inequality with nation-state inequality, is unreflectively party to that. It is indeed astonishing how firmly global inequalities are 'legitimated' on the basis of tacit agreement between nation-state government and nation-state sociology-a sociology programmed to work on a nation-state basis and claiming to be value-free! My point is that while the performance principle legitimates national inequality, the nation-state principle legitimates global inequality (in another form). How? The inequalities between countries, regions and states are accounted politically incomparable. In a perspective bounded by the nation-state, politically relevant comparisons can only be played out within the nation-state, never between states.

Many migrants take seriously the proclaimed human right of equality of mobility and encounter countries and states which-not least under the impact of increasing internal inequalities-want the norm of equality to stop short at their fortified borders. Put in other words, that means: the conception of social class, based on principles of nationality and statehood, misleads analysis.

An earlier phase of modernity was organized primarily in terms of nationstates, which sought to manage many of the risks people faced, although markets and other phenomena did cross state boundaries. 2. Modern social and political theory grew with the dominance of nation-states and internalized the nation-state as the tacit model for the ideal-as-societyinfluenced by the actual power of nation-states, but also by the widespread aspiration to organize the world on the basis of nation-states. 3. An earlier philosophical cosmopolitanism developed in Europe in this context, calling on people ethically to transcend narrow nationalist views, as though the sociological conditions of their lives did not really matter. 4. Today we have to make a clear distinction between the norms of cosmopolitanism (which you find as a normative concept already in the sociology of Auguste Comte and \u00c9mile Durkheim) and the facts of cosmopolitization which are a genuine issue of empirical-analytical social sciences. Cosmopolitan sociology neglects the Durkheim/Parsons model of 'value integration' of national society. It neglects also theories which declare the death of the social. But it emphasizes the transformation of the social and a new methodological cosmopolitanism to study the ambivalences of the cosmopolitization of intermediated institutions. 5. The same applies to the international level: consider global free trade and financialization, corporate deterritorialization and transnationalized production, globalized labour use, internet communication, globally orchestrated bio-scientific manipulation of life forms and, last but not least, globally financed and managed regional wars. As stated earlier, recent world history seems to dictate that surviving these new civilizational forces, let alone benefiting from them, requires every nation to actively internalize them and one another. This is what I call '(reflexive) cosmopolitization'; and the civilizational condition shared across the globe I call 'reflexive' or 'second modernity'. 6. I do not see the nation-state as disappearing, but rather see it as only one of many actors in a global power game. The focus needs to be on that global power game and not on the nation-state. Importance could accrue to regional powers like 'Cosmopolitan Europe', ('Cosmopolitan Asia' etc.). 7. Such a shift in focus requires the restructuring of the social sciences not only conceptually, theoretically, and methodologically, but also in the very organization of research. All their fundamental concepts-especially those of social class, family, work and the nation-state-need to be re-examined. Many are 'zombie concepts' that continue to live on even though the world they related to at one time no longer exists. 8. Cosmopolitan sociology is just at its beginnings. It entails more questions than answers [British Journal of Sociology 2006, 57(1); 2010, 61(3); Soziale Welt 2010, 61(3-4)]. But it does involve a fundamental re-organization of the social sciences, and a dramatic shift in focus-from methodological nationalism to methodological cosmopolitanism. And it must also be critical in its orientation. One critical focus must be on the increasing inequality in the world and its social explosiveness. The focus on the nation-state has led to a shameful subordination of 'objective' and 'value-free' sociology to the imperatives of the nation-state which blinds even empirical sociology to the fundamental transnational transformations of domination and inequality. 9. Another critical focus: problems of social inequalities and justice in first industrial nation-state modernity were once pursued and fought over as the 'goods' of modern society (things like incomes, jobs, social security etc.); in the cosmopolitical age, those 'goods' are off-set by conflicts over the 'bads'. These include the very means by which many of the old goods were in fact attained. More pointedly, they involve the threatening and incalculable side effects and so-called 'externalities' produced by nuclear and chemical power, genetic research, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the overriding obsession with ensuring sustained economic growth. The social and psychic volatility wrought by cultural relativism, on the one hand, and recognition of risk, on the other, generate an enormous discontent, which in turn inspires various political and social movements for reform and resistance.",
