Tuberculosis is a very difficult organism to kill; only bacterial spores are more difficult to inactivate than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Any chemical germicide with a tuberculocidal claim (Intermediate-level disinfectant) is considered capable of inactivating a broad spectrum of microorganisms of most concern in the dental setting, including less-resistant organisms such as blood-borne pathogens (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV). More importantly, nonenveloped viruses such as coxsackievirus and rhinovirus (the cause of many upper respiratory infections), human papillomavirus (HPV, the cause of cervical and oropharyngeal cancer), and multiple species of fungi are inactivated by an intermediate-level disinfectant, but these organisms are not inactivated by low-level disinfectants [1, 15, 16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 269, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1071, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1075, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1079, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tuberculocidal Activity"}, {"text": "Although no perfect product for surface disinfection has been introduced to date, there is a large number of acceptable EPA-registered hospital disinfectants available for use in the dental setting.
