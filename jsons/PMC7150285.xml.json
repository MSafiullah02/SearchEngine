            "text": "Coronavirus virions have a diameter of 80\u2013120 nm and contain the largest known RNA genome (~30 kb of positive-sense single-stranded RNA). Three viral structural proteins, membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S), are anchored in the host-derived viral envelope, while the nucleocapsid (N) protein encloses the RNA genome. The S protein mediates the first steps of virus entry, namely the binding to the respective host\u2013cell receptor, during which it undergoes conformational changes, and the subsequent fusion with the host cell membrane. The S protein variants determine host cell tropism. Entry of the virion into the cell is followed by its disassembly and the release of the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm, where it is directly translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. A viral-encoded proteinase then cleaves the polypeptides into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). One of these is the viral RNA polymerase, which uses the positive RNA strand to synthesize the negative strand, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs encoding for structural proteins (S, E, M, N). Other nsps are thought to induce membrane rearrangements in the host cell that lead to the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, giving rise to a reticulovesicular network (Figure 8.1\n). This network is associated with the viral replication\u2013transcription complexes (RTCs) (Gosert et al., 2002, Snijder et al., 2006), thereby providing a replication platform, which has several advantages for the virus: (1) the viral genome is protected from the host cell\u2019s degradative enzymes; (2) the dsRNA intermediate produced during replication is isolated and therefore cannot trigger the host cell\u2019s immune response (Versteeg et al., 2007, Zhou and Perlman, 2007); and (3) membrane lipids of the host cell membranes can be used for the viral envelope. After successful replication, the genomic RNA and the N proteins form the nucleocapsid. Although other structural proteins are found in different subcellular locations (M protein in the Golgi apparatus, E protein in the ER, and S protein in the secretory pathway and at the plasma membrane), the virions assemble through ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane invagination and budding events into the ERGIC. From the lumen of the ERGIC, the virions are released from the cell via the secretory pathway.",

However, later studies by Zhao et al.

Indeed, infected cells show dramatic membrane modifications of the ER, with formation of a reticulovesicular network including DMV structures (Figure 8.1) that later in infection convert into huge, single-membrane vesicles (Knoops et al., 2008). Viral replication factors were found in reticular structures close to the DMVs, while dsRNA was mainly found in DMVs without connection to the cytosol, which leaves open the question of how the newly synthesized RNA finds its way to the places of virus assembly. Further evidence of the ER origin of DMVs came from analyses of nsp localization and function. nsp4 and nsp6 were found to be N-glycosylated (a feature of proteins processed in the ER), to be localized in the ER membrane, and to induce DMV-like structures when ectopically expressed in cells (Gadlage et al., 2009).",

This leads to the formation of LC3-I, which exposes a carboxy terminal glycine at position 120 (Figure 8.2\n). Activation of autophagy leads to a series of sequential reactions consisting in the activation of LC3-I by the E1-like enzyme Atg7, and the intervention of the E2-like enzyme Atg3 and of the Atg5\u2013Atg12 complex that, acting as an E3 ligase, conjugates LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the pre-autophagosomal membrane generating the LC3-II form (reviewed in Tanida, 2010) (Figure 8.2). While the autophagic cargo (i.e., cytoplasmic components, damaged organelles) is engulfed, the pre-autophagosome matures into an autophagosome and increasing amounts of LC3-II are inserted into both its inner and outer membrane. After autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion into the autolysosome, the LC3-II on the cytosolic face of the autophagosomal membrane is recycled back to LC3-I by Atg4B-mediated de-lipidation. On the other hand, the LC3-II located in the intra-autophagosomal membrane is degraded by lysosomal enzymes together with the autophagosomal cargo. The role of LC3 in autophagy is probably the mediation of microtubule plus-end-directed transport of the autophagosome to the lysosome/late endosomes via binding to the Rab7 effector FYCO1 (Pankiv et al., 2010).",

A multitude of ER-resident molecular chaperones and folding factors assist in the folding and the maturation of nascent polypeptide chains that enter the ER lumen co-translationally.

            "text": "Polypeptides that do not attain the native structure in due time must be removed from the ER and degraded. A complex series of events, collectively called ER-associated degradation (ERAD), targets misfolded polypeptides for dislocation into the cytosol, polyubiquitination, and subsequent degradation by the cytosolic 26S proteasomes. Maintenance of cellular proteostasis relies on tight regulation of the ER-folding, quality-control, and degradation machineries. Pathologic or experimental conditions that enhance ERAD activity may cause premature interruption of ongoing folding programs. As a consequence, polypeptides that have not yet attained the native structure might be selected for disposal. On the other hand, insufficient ERAD activity may cause intracellular accumulation of misfolded conformers and may impair ER quality control, thus leading to secretion of misfolded polypeptides that should rather be retained intracellularly and degraded. Accumulation of high levels of misfolded proteins in the ER leads to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in transcriptional upregulation of chaperones, which can take several hours to occur. It has recently been proposed that several mechanisms operate in mammalian cells to more rapidly adapt the content and the activity of select ER-resident factors to fluctuations in ER cargo load (Cali et al., 2008, Bernasconi et al., 2012, Chambers et al., 2012). For example, ERAD activity is tightly controlled by post-translational mechanisms, collectively termed ERAD tuning. These mechanisms regulate the turnover of select ERAD factors, their subcellular localization, and their inclusion in functional supramolecular complexes, depending on the level of misfolded proteins in the ER. In recent publications, we have shown that ERAD factors such as EDEM1 and OS-9 are constitutively segregated from the ER into so-called ERAD tuning vesicles (Figure 8.3\n). This selective segregation does not involve any component of the conventional secretory pathway. Instead, the ER membrane-anchored protein SEL1L and the cytosolic LC3-I act as an ERAD tuning receptor to selectively deliver OS-9 and EDEM1 into the ERAD tuning vesicle. Detailed studies have revealed that LC3-I is non-covalently associated to the vesicle membrane, and that it associates to the cytosolic tail of SEL1L or of a SEL1L-associated protein (Cali et al., 2008, Bernasconi et al., 2012).\n",

Our studies also revealed that the autophagy gene Atg7, and hence the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, is dispensable for DMV formation (as it is for the formation of the ERAD tuning vesicles) and for viral replication. Significantly, siRNA-mediated silencing of LC3 or SEL1L expression inhibits MHV replication and virion production, a phenotype that is efficiently reverted upon back-transfection of a G120R LC3 mutant that cannot be lipidated. These data show that LC3-I and SEL1L are required and sufficient to support MHV replication.

            "text": "The intracellular level of a given protein might be regulated at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational level. While the former two mechanisms are rather slow responses, since they involve mRNA transcription and/or protein synthesis, respectively, the latter is more rapid and readily reversible. The work of our group and others established an unanticipated role of non-lipidated LC3 in a post-translational mechanism, called ERAD tuning, that regulates constitutive ERAD activity and the adaptation of ERAD activity to fluctuations in ER cargo load with misfolded polypeptides. By binding to the cytosolic tail of the ER membrane protein SEL1L (or of a SEL1L-associated protein), LC3-I participates in an ERAD tuning receptor that removes ERAD factors such as OS-9 and EDEM1 from the ER lumen and delivers them in cytosolic ERAD tuning vesicles. ERAD factors\u2019 segregation from the ER is one way to set ERAD activity at levels that do not interfere with ongoing folding processes in the ER (Cali et al., 2008, Bernasconi et al., 2012). In this way, cells guard against hyper-ERAD activity, which can result in loss-of-function phenotypes. Examples thereof are increased sarcoma metastasis (Tsai et al., 2007) and rheumatoid arthritis (Yamasaki et al., 2005, Joshi et al., 2010), where elevated levels of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases result in the disease-causing inappropriate destruction of native proteins. As shown for many other intracellular pathways, the vesicle-mediated removal of ERAD factors from the ER is hijacked by pathogens. Viruses such as MHV and EAV co-opt the EDEM1- and OS-9-containing vesicles as platforms for their replication, and/or to protect the viral ssRNA from the detection by the host\u2019s immune system. Also in this context, non-lipidated LC3 plays a crucial role, as silencing of its expression (and silencing of SEL1L, the second component of the ERAD tuning receptor) inhibits viral replication. Efficient DMV formation and viral replication in cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7, both proteins being involved in LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, demonstrates that lipidation of LC3-I is not required for viral replication. This novel finding is surprising, since LC3-I was commonly regarded as the non-functional precursor of the lipidated autophagosome marker LC3-II. However, individual reports have indicated more diverse functions of this protein besides the autophagic pathway. For example, non-lipidated LC3 has been shown to mediate the association of caldendrin to the microtubule cytoskeleton (Seidenbecher et al., 2004). Furthermore, in the organism Pichia pastoris, non-lipidated Atg8, the yeast homologue of LC3, plays a role in homotypic vacuole fusion (Tamura et al., 2010). Inclusions of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis in human cells are connected to the microtubular network via non-lipidated LC3, while lipidated LC3 does not co-localize with the inclusions. Also, non-lipidated LC3, but not an intact autophagic machinery, is essential for the development of the pathogen (Al-Younes et al., 2011). All these examples hint at unappreciated roles of LC3 in its cytosolic, non-lipidated form, alongside its crucial role in autophagy upon lipidation.",
