            "text": "Effective and efficacious drug screening methods are imperative in the drug discovery process. Recently a new approach, namely, microtiter plate-based synthesis coupled with in situ screening, has attracted increasing attention. The validity of this method was demonstrated by the identification of potent inhibitors of several enzymes such as HIV protease, [1] [2] [3] sulfotransferase, [4] a-fucosidase, [5, 6] SARS coronavirus main protease, [7] fucosyltransferase, [8] and anthrax lethal factor. [9] The strategy utilizes an organic reaction between a core structure and a set of building blocks to generate a diversity-oriented library in a microtiter plate in which a single compound is formed in each well, followed by direct screening without purification. Several reactions (for example, amide bond forming reaction, cycloaddition reaction, Pictet-Spengler reaction, etc.) that are rapid, chemoselective, quantitative, free of protecting groups, and compatible with aqueous solution have been applied to this technique. [10] Previous investigations have shown that this approach is really useful in discovering potent enzyme inhibitors, however, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has so far applied this approach to a cell-based assay. As a live cell is a collection of various organelles, it is more complex compared with a single enzyme. Compounds that have a potent effect on an enzyme sometimes have no or little effect on cells, [11] or the IC 50 values of compounds against an enzyme are not exactly related to their cell inhibitory potencies, [12, 13] probably because of the cell uptake and metabolism processes that are not reflected in these IC 50 values. It will be of great significance if this approach can be applied directly to cell-based screening. To explore the possibility of live cell screening, we selected two iminosugars as core structures to establish a library by parallel synthesis followed by in situ screening using tumor cells to find anticancer compounds.",

            "text": "Effective and efficacious drug screening methods are imperative in the drug discovery process. Recently a new approach, namely, microtiter plate-based synthesis coupled with in situ screening, has attracted increasing attention. The validity of this method was demonstrated by the identification of potent inhibitors of several enzymes such as HIV protease, [1] [2] [3] sulfotransferase, [4] a-fucosidase, [5, 6] SARS coronavirus main protease, [7] fucosyltransferase, [8] and anthrax lethal factor. [9] The strategy utilizes an organic reaction between a core structure and a set of building blocks to generate a diversity-oriented library in a microtiter plate in which a single compound is formed in each well, followed by direct screening without purification. Several reactions (for example, amide bond forming reaction, cycloaddition reaction, Pictet-Spengler reaction, etc.) that are rapid, chemoselective, quantitative, free of protecting groups, and compatible with aqueous solution have been applied to this technique. [10] Previous investigations have shown that this approach is really useful in discovering potent enzyme inhibitors, however, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has so far applied this approach to a cell-based assay. As a live cell is a collection of various organelles, it is more complex compared with a single enzyme. Compounds that have a potent effect on an enzyme sometimes have no or little effect on cells, [11] or the IC 50 values of compounds against an enzyme are not exactly related to their cell inhibitory potencies, [12, 13] probably because of the cell uptake and metabolism processes that are not reflected in these IC 50 values. It will be of great significance if this approach can be applied directly to cell-based screening. To explore the possibility of live cell screening, we selected two iminosugars as core structures to establish a library by parallel synthesis followed by in situ screening using tumor cells to find anticancer compounds.",

[26] With compounds 1 and 2 in hand, their derivation reactions were carried out. Oxidation of 1 with PCC produced the aldehyde 3 in 90 % isolated yield, which was readily converted to the oxime 5 in 93 % yield by treatment with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of potassium bicarbon-ate. Finally, catalytic hydrogenolysis of 5 over Pd-C in the mixed solvent of acetic acid, water, and THF (v/v 1:2:4) provided the target iminosugar a. Iminosugar b was prepared from 2 by the same procedure as described in the preparation of a in 81 % overall yield. Thus, simple transformations of 1 and 2 led to compounds a and b, respectively. Compounds a and b were then used for the subsequent diversity-oriented synthesis by the reaction with 50 carboxylic acids (Scheme 2). The reaction was carried out in DMF on a microscale in the presence of (1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 1 equiv) and diisopropyl ethylamine (DIEA, 2 equiv), followed by medium dilution and screening without any purification. Different from the method mentioned previously, in our operation each reaction was performed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube instead of a well of a microtiter plate. Mass spectrum and TLC analyses were performed to identify the existence of products. The reaction proceeded at a concentration of 36 mm and upon completion the reaction mixture was diluted 1000-fold (final concentration: 36 mm) and 5000-fold (final concentration: 7.2 mm) for screening.",
