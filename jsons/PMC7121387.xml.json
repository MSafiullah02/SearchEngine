The collection includes items that date back to the 1840s, evidence that the manufacture of bio-based materials is not a new phenomenon. In 1855, Francois Charles Lepage patented, in France and England, an extruded plastic composite material manufactured from ebony or rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia) sawdust and diluted egg albumin (Lepage, UK patent No. 2232). This material was compressed in steel moulds under pressure with steam heat to produce a composite material known as or \u2018 \u2019. Different products were made from bois durci, including portrait plaques, plaques for attaching to furniture and pianos, picture and mirror frames, inkstands, pen trays, blotters and letter racks, barometers, belt buckles and brooches, album and book covers, boxes, clocks, dishes, paper weights, statuettes, purses, caskets and other articles.",

It was granted to a German chemist, Adolf Spitteler, and his business partner, Ernst Wilhelm Krische, in 1899, for making plastic from milk casein (protein) and formaldehyde. The process for producing the casein semisynthetic plastic was accidently discovered when Spitteler\u2019s cat knocked over a small bottle of formaldehyde one night from the chemist\u2019s counter into the cat\u2019s milk on the floor. The next morning, the chemist found that the cat\u2019s milk had turned into a hard, celluloid-like substance. Spitteler experimented with casein and formaldehyde mixtures and found that casein could be transformed into water-insoluble plastic by letting it sit in formaldehyde for extended periods of time.",

He was trying to manufacture washable white writing boards for export to Turkey and was experimenting by coating cardboard with milk curdle, since casein was commonly used as a binding material. In fact, casein has had a long history of nonfood applications. The industrial use of casein goes back to at least 2 centuries BCE in Egypt, where casein was used as an adhesive material for colour pigments in paint manufacturing. Spitteler and Krische found each other and worked together on developing the milk protein plastic. They named it Galalith, a Greek word from gala (milk) and lithos (stone) or milk stone. The other trade names that were used for casein plastic were Aladdinite (in the USA) and Lactoid. In Britain, the trade name Erinoid, derived from the Gaelic word for Ireland, which was the source of most British cheese curds, was used for the milk protein plastics.",

In 1929, P.C. Christensen added aluminium stearate to hornlike casein plastic and converted it to a soft plastic for the automotive industry. Worldwide casein production increased from 10,000 tons in 1930 to 30,000 in 1932. In 1937, William S. Murray patented a method for converting the milk sugar in skimmed milk to an aldehyde, thus eliminating the use of formaldehyde in the plastic hardening process and reducing manufacturing waste (Murray and Utica 1937). The main products made from casein in this era were imitation pearl, tortoiseshell and ivory for buttons, belt buckles, knitting needles and jewellery. World War II resulted in a large reduction in the production and use of casein. Today, casein is still used to manufacture buttons and knitting needles.",

            "text": " Soybean was early plant source for protein-based plastics. This crop was domesticated in China between 1500 and 1027 BCE (Hymowitz and Singh 1987). With the development of sea and land routes, the cultivation of soybean spread to the rest of Asia but remained a minor crop between the first and eleventh century AD (Hymowitz 1990). Samuel Brown, an East India Company employee, introduced soybean from India-Pakistan to North America in 1765, where Henry Young planted it in Savannah, Georgia (Hymowitz and Harlan 1983). However, soybean crops were not developed in North America until World War I, when a shortage of vegetable oil made it an alternative source for this purpose (Ralston and Osswald 2008). Today, soybean is one of the most important sources of oil and protein in the modern world. The dry soybean seed contains approximately 40% protein by weight (Liu et al. 2007). The first patent on soybean protein plastic was granted in Europe (France and UK) in 1913 and in the USA in 1916 to a Japanese researcher named Sadakichi Satow. Unfortunately, soy protein plastics had similar drawbacks to casein, including shrinkage, porosity and moisture absorption after drying in formaldehyde.",

Ford prepared moulded plastics from soybean meal and hardened them with formaldehyde. By 1936, one million Ford vehicles were on the road containing 15 pounds of soymeal plastic parts. However, the auto parts made from this extruded soymeal were moisture-sensitive. Prior to World War II, some progress was made to produce slightly hydrophobic soy-based materials, but the war impaired the opportunity. In any case, these developments in the production of bio-based materials in the 1800s and early 1900s played significant roles in shaping the modern materials industry.",

            "text": "The mechanical properties that are commonly measured for films include their strength, elasticity and plasticity. These measurements are made by clamping the film between the jaws of a and applying a strain at a fixed linear rate to the sample and measuring the stress. The resulting stress-strain curves can be used to calculate the tensile strength (TS) , elastic modulus (EM) , and of the film (Fig. 9.1). Tensile strength and EM are usually expressed in pascals (Pa); one pascal is equal to one newton (1 N) of force applied over one metre squared (1 m2). , which is the geometrical measure of deformation, is expressed in percent elongation (E) and represents the relative displacement between particles in the material body (Jacob 2008). The EM measures the stiffness of the film (Banker 1966). It is calculated by drawing a tangent to the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve (Fig. 9.1), selecting any point on the tangent curve and dividing the tensile stress by the corresponding strain. Yield strength is the amount of stress at which the film starts to plastically deform. Prior to the yield point, the film deforms elastically and will return to its original shape and size when the stress is released (Dieter et al. 2003). Tensile strength at break point is the amount of force per unit of the original cross-sectional area to pull the film to point where it breaks (Banker 1966). The distance between the yield point and the tensile strength point along the stress- strain curve indicates the degree of plasticity of the film.",

The tensile properties of films are affected by protein composition (Table 9.3), protein concentration, amount of plasticizer , pH, ionic strength and heating temperature (Sze et al. 2007). Attractive forces between proteins in the protein film matrix, including hydrogen bonds between backbone amino and carbonyl groups to stabilize \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet secondary structures within the proteins and to form links between protein molecules, or with the plasticizer (Choi et al. 2003), or electrostatic forces among polymer chains (Takashi et al. 2007), ionic interactions or salt linkages or bridges between oppositely charged functional groups of amino acids in protein side chains and disulphide (S \u2013 S) bonds within and between different protein chains (Subirade et al. 1998; Sang et al. 2000), allow the development of a film matrix from denatured protein. During the film drying period, water is progressively eliminated, and protein conformations change, including the degree of protein unfolding, which determines the types and numbers of bonds that establish interactions between proteins (Denavi et al. 2009; Mauri and Anon 2006). The cohesion of the film network is a function of all these interactive forces, which determine the properties of the film .",

Sometimes the barrier properties of the protein films and coatings have to meet certain standards in order to be used for particular applications, such as packaging foods or drugs. Generally, protein films are permeable to polar substances, such as water, but less permeable to nonpolar substances such as oxygen, oil, aroma and microorganisms compared to low-density polyethylene films (Lim et al. 1999; Krochta 2002; Table 9.5). The high permeability to polar substances reflects the fact that its two major ingredients, namely, proteins and plasticizers, are generally polar in nature. Nevertheless, protein films manufactured from different proteins have different moisture and oxygen permeabilities (Table 9.5).",

High levels of plasticizer weaken the attractive forces in film networks and dramatically reduce film stiffness but elevate elongation properties (Tables 9.6 and 9.7). Different types and amounts of plasticizers interact differently even within a single polypeptide chain. For example, studies of soy protein films plasticized with glycerol revealed that there were two glass transition temperatures, indicating that the films contained two microdomains that interacted differently with glycerol (Chen and Zhang 2005). The presence of these domains suggests that protein and glycerol are not uniformly compatible across the polymer chains, but there is a preferential linking between protein polymer regions and glycerol molecules. Usually, higher quantities of plasticizers reduce mechanical and barrier properties (Cuq et al. 1997). Extensive research efforts have been focused on modifying the properties of protein-based films to improve their mechanical and barrier properties for industrial applications (Rhim 2004; Rhim and Weller 2000; Rhim et al. 1999, 1998, 2000; Micard et al. 2000; Gennadios et al. 1993, 1998; Ghorpade et al. 1995; Park et al. 1993).",

The biodegradability of films by microorganisms in composting environments at the end of their life cycle, by naturally occurring microorganisms into water, carbon dioxide , methane, biomass and mineral residues, is an important attribute of many protein-based bioproducts, as it helps to reduce environmental pollution due to packaging. ASTM International (American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials) standard methods for aerobic compositing (D6400\u201312) and aerobic biodegradation (D5338) have been developed to measure the biodegradability of materials. In order for a plastic product to be labelled compostable, it must meet the US Standard ASTM D6400 and/or the European Norm EN 13432. Both specifications require that materials be completely biodegraded during composting at a rate similar to other known compostable materials (90% of organic carbon to CO2 within 180 days) and should not leave visual or toxic residue .",

The physical and chemical properties of the adhesive, the type of adherents and the nature of the surface pretreatments are important factors in glue performance, in the short and long terms. To make initial molecular contact, adhesives have the ability to wet and spread evenly on the surfaces of the materials one wishes to joint. Once that is achieved, intrinsic attractive forces are generated across interfaces through a number of mechanisms including (occurs when adhesive molecules are attracted to a specific site on a solid surface through weak van der Waals forces or chemisorption through covalent bonding), (occurs when the adhesive flows into pores or solidifies around the projections), (occurs when the adhesive dissolves and diffuses into the substrate material) and (occur when electrons are transferred across the interface, thus creating positive and negative charges that attract one another). Generally, several mechanisms contribute to the performance of adhesives with various types of adherents .",

Generally, protein adhesives have sufficient strength in dry conditions but are susceptible to moisture and mould (Lambuth 2003). The nature of the protein determines the formulation, mixing and application of the adhesive. The manufacturing steps, however, are common and include grinding dry protein extracts to glue particle sizes (typically with surface areas between 3000 and 6000 cm2 per gram), sufficiently dispersing the ground proteins in alkaline water for maximum binding efficiency and addition of fungicide (such as sodium orthophenylphenate, sodium pentachlorophenate, copper-8-quinolinate or copper naphthenate) to prevent mould.",

            "text": "Adhesive durability has been a problem for protein glues. Several protein modifications including physical, chemical and enzymatic treatment are used to enhance the functional properties of protein adhesives such as bonding strengths and environmental and moisture resistance. Treatment of proteins with organic or inorganic alkali, such as sodium hydroxide or trisodium phosphate, breaks the internal hydrogen bonds of protein molecules, unfolds the protein structure and exposes the polar functional groups of the amino acid residues for adhesion to binding surfaces such as wood (Brother et al. 1940; Lambuth 2003). The combination of alkali treatment and mild heating of the protein in deionized water breaks the inter- and intramolecular protein hydrogen and disulphide bonds and unfolds the protein structure to improve the adhesive and viscosity and hydrophobic properties of the glues (Graham and Krinski 1983). For example, soy protein heated at 50 \u00b0C and a pH of 10.0 improved adhesive strength by 118% and the hydrophobic properties of soy protein glues by 92% (Hettiarachchy et al. 1995). The amount of alkali in the protein adhesives depends on the usage in the final product. For example, high-alkali (Table 9.10) soy protein adhesives prevent glue swelling, maintain glue viscosity and improve moisture resistance by forming insoluble proteinates (Laucks and Davidson 1928). However, it also burns wood cellulose and causes reddish-brown stains on wood surfaces (Truax 1929). On the other hand, low-alkali soy protein adhesives are less dispersive and have lower bonding strengths. This makes them good for paper and softboard lamination, but not for structural usage such as sheathing plywood (Sheeran 1957; Lambuth 2003). Furthermore, salt treatment of disulphide bond-containing proteins, such as soy protein, results in cleavage of the disulphide bonds and unfolded protein structures, which improves the viscosity of glues without reducing adhesive strengths and water resistance at certain concentrations. High concentrations of salts, however, reduce viscosity, adhesive strengths and water resistance (Kalapathy et al. 1996).",

These networks improve the adhesive and moisture resistance properties of protein-based glues. For example, soy protein modified with urea and guanidine hydrochloride increases the average shear strengths in walnut (Juglans spp.), cherry (Prunus spp.) and pine plywoods by 34 and 37%, respectively. In addition, both urea and guanidine hydrochloride-modified soy protein exhibited 100% moisture resistance. These chemicals are known to increase the production of secondary structures in globular proteins, which may be responsible for enhancing adhesive strength and also expose hydrophobic amino acids, which might enhance water resistance (Huang and Sun 2000). Furthermore, the addition of polyamidoamine- epichlorohydrin to maleic anhydride-grafted soy protein isolates improves the adhesive properties of glues to such an extent that they exceed those of commercial phenol formaldehyde glues (Liu and Li 2007).",

However, for this approach to be successful, the proteins in the mixture must be compatible and have similar processing requirements to convert them into glues. Soy-blood and soy-casein blends have successfully been used in interior plywood and softwood manufacturing during the 1930s to 1960s and again during the oil embargo in 1973.

Some of the ongoing limitations of protein fibres involve performance characteristics, such as moisture sensitivity and mechanical properties. However, like any field of material research, improvements in protein-based fibres are being explored.

With the advances in nanotechnology seen in the last two decades, it is now possible to design and produce that contain an electrospun nanofibrous layer applied to a basic support fabric material. These wound dressings have very high surface area to volume ratios. They are able to control the release of drugs such as antibiotics and analgesics co-spun with protein nanofibre; prevent haemostasis, high filtration and liquid absorption efficiencies; and stimulate the growth of live cells.

Mammalian cell culture systems are complicated and expensive processes; they require large bioreactors and high energy inputs for commercial-scale production. In contrast, plant systems are cost-effective, quicker to scale up, easy to propagate and simple to distribute. In addition, there is no risk of contamination by human pathogens (such as viruses and prions), and relatively cheap systems exist for purification and concentration of the therapeutic proteins. Plant platforms can synthesize and accumulate valuable proteins to high levels. These proteins are properly assembled and folded and can be post-transcriptionally modified to yield complex protein molecules. In addition, if the plants are engineered to accumulate the proteins in storage tissues and cellular compartments, they may be stably stored without refrigeration.",

In this approach, the DNA encoding the target protein is fused with DNA sequences encoding targeting peptides, stabilizing sequences, elastin-like proteins, hydrophobins and prolamine seed storage proteins ( \u03b3-zein), amino acid affinity tags or oil bodies (Conley et al. 2011). Both SemBioSys (no longer trading) and Plant Farm Corp. have developed technologies that combine the high-capacity, low-cost production of therapeutic proteins in seeds with a novel technology that simplifies downstream purification. In this instance, the genes encoding the target proteins are fused with a sequence encoding a small protein called oleosin. The resulting fusion protein accumulates on oil bodies within the seed. These oil bodies and the oleosin/protein fusion are then simply purified from other components in ground seeds by centrifugation because they float. The protein is released from the oil bodies into an aqueous extraction solution by enzymatic digestion of the oleosin/protein linker, and initial purification is accomplished without expensive chromatography.",
