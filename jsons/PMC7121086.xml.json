            "text": "Ubiquitin and all members of the ubiquitin family are attached to protein substrates through biochemical processes which are similar but implicate distinct sets of enzymes with the capacity to act on a limited number of reactions (Fig. 11.1). All protein modifiers of the ubiquitin family are generated through the proteolytical cleavage of higher molecular weight precursors that exposes the double glycine (GG) signature, typically found in this family, and which is required for their attachment to protein substrates (reviewed in Jentsch and Pyrowolakis 2000). The attachment (or conjugation) of ubiquitin or UbL modifiers is mediated by a thiol-ester cascade of reactions that requires the action of three enzymes: an activating enzyme or E1 that will activate all molecules required for all reactions and a conjugating enzyme or E2 that, in most cases, will conjugate protein modifiers to their targets. Ubiquitin ligases or E3s are responsible for, or are required to achieve the conjugation of the modifier to its target protein (Fig. 11.1). The role that an E3 will exert depends on its capacity to form thiol-ester intermediates with protein modifiers. The ubiquitin ligases of the HECT family are typical examples of these active enzymes. Another category of E3 ligases contributes to bring together substrates and E2s in order to achieve protein conjugation without having any enzymatic activity. Among this category of E3s, we found the cullin-RING ligase (CRLs) composed of multiple subunits that will allow the specific recognition of a degradable substrate (e.g. after its phosphorylation). The contribution of E4 factors favouring chain extension has also been proposed (Hoppe 2005). Chain formation is essential to drive distinct functions. While ubiquitin chain linkages K48 and K11 have been associated with degradation, K63 chains appear to connect signalling cascades, endocytic trafficking or DNA repair. The formation of hybrid chains containing ubiquitin and UbLs such as SUMO2/3 is also possible (Aillet et al. 2012; Guzzo and Matunis 2013; Kulathu and Komander 2012) but a generic function of these chains has not been established. Deubiquitylating enzymes or DUBs recognize specific ubiquitin chains from target substrates through ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) to know which chains should be cleaved (Eletr and Wilkinson 2014). An equivalent reaction is achieved by SUMO-specific proteases (SUSPs) or NEDD8 specific protease (NEDP1), also known as Denedylase 1 (DEN1) (Hickey et al. 2012). All isopeptidases show specificity for a modifier, however due to saturated in vitro assays, overexpression or certain stress conditions, cross-reactions have been reported thus making any conclusion on the exclusivity of these reactions difficult. Although the initial drug discovery strategies used enzymes recognizing protein substrates (E3s and isopeptidases) to develop new chemical inhibitors, nowadays all enzymes are considered as good candidates for drug development.\n\n",

The 20S core particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of two different types of subunits. The two outer rings are formed by seven alpha subunits (\u03b11\u2013\u03b17) that allow the interaction with the 19S particle, while the inner rings are composed of seven beta subunits (\u03b21\u2013\u03b27), three of which are responsible for the catalytic activity. The catalytic mechanism of these subunits is the same because they use the hydroxyl group of the N-terminal threonine of a mature \u03b2-subunit to perform the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of a peptide bond (Borissenko and Groll 2007; Kisselev and Goldberg 2001; Kisselev et al. 2012; Voges et al. 1999). Each subunit reacts with specific substrates: \u03b21 subunit possesses peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH) activity that cleaves after acid residues, \u03b22 has trypsin-like activity that cleaves after basic residues and \u03b25 subunit shows chymotrypsin-like activity that cleaves after hydrophobic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of these catalytic residues in yeast showed that the most drastic changes occurred when \u03b25 subunit is inactivated (Heinemeyer et al. 1997).",

Furthermore, the immune-proteasome facilitates the clearance of protein aggregates to prevent cell death produced by IFN-induced oxidative stress, (Seifert et al. 2010).

            "text": "The new generation of proteasome inhibitors always aims to increase potency, specificity and stability with good bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Conventional proteasome inhibitors efficiently block at least one of the three proteasome active sites (\u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b25) either with covalent or non-covalent, reversible or irreversible binding. Most Inhibitors and drugs in clinical trials are mimetic peptides that interact directly with the active site thus blocking the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the proteasome N-terminal threonine active sites (Kisselev and Goldberg 2001; Orlowski and Kuhn 2008). Proteasome inhibitors are often classified according to their functional group (Table 11.1):\nBoronic acid peptides: Peptide aldehyde analogues were synthetized substituting the aldehyde group for boronic acid (Bortezomib) (Adams et al. 1998). Bortezomib is more potent, stable and interacts more specifically with the \u03b25 subunit, forming tetrahedral intermediates with two extra hydrogen bonds that stabilize the covalent bond (Groll et al. 2006). Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor administrated intravenously with very low dissociation rate that behaves as an irreversible molecule. It has a dose limiting toxicity and produces multiple side effects in patients, including pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy. Despite its potency and effectiveness, about 60 % of the treated patients develop resistance to Bortezomib after 1 year of treatment (Mujtaba et al. 2012). The resistance mechanisms are still poorly understood but have a multifactorial basis (Xolalpa et al. 2013).A second-generation of proteasome inhibitors, currently in clinical trials, include the boronic acid peptides MLN2238, MLN9708 and CEP-18770. Unlike Bortezomib, these inhibitors reduce neuropathy. MLN2238 and its oral analogue MLN9708, are reversible inhibitors in phase III trials with stronger chymotrypsin-like activity inhibition in vivo and a faster dissociation rate, able to penetrate inside tissues (Kupperman et al. 2010). The oral inhibitor CEP-18770 in phase I and II trials shows encouraging results for the treatment of haematologic and solid tumours (Piva et al. 2008).\nEpoxyketone peptides. These peptides are the most potent and specific proteasome inhibitors known. They form a morpholine adduct with the N-terminal threonine through a covalent and an irreversible bond (Groll et al. 2000). Carfilzomib (Demo et al. 2007) and ONX-0912 (Chauhan et al. 2010) belong to this class of inhibitors. They show a high chemical stability causing a stronger inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity than Bortezomib (Huber and Groll 2012), and overcome the problem of resistance to Bortezomib. Due to their higher specificity, neurotoxicity is reduced (Molineaux 2012) but other side effects still persist (Fostier et al. 2012). Carfilzomib is currently used for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and the orally bioavailable ONX-0912 is included in phase I and II trials where it has shown an improved therapeutic window.\u03b2-\nlactones\n:\nNon-peptidic inhibitors have also been developed to improve bioavailability. The compound derived from the marine microorganism Salinispora tropica, Marizomib, is a \u03b2-lactone inhibitor in phase I trials (Fenical et al. 2009). Its \u03b2-lactone group reacts with the catalytic threonines of the proteasome active site forming an acyl-ester adduct and a tetrahydrofuran ring that stabilizes the binding leading to a highly potent, selective and orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor. Contrary to epoxyketones and peptide boronic acids, Marizomib inhibits the three activities of the proteasome irreversibly, in a stronger (more than 90 %) and longer-lasting way (Miller et al. 2011). The use of marizomib results in adverse effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting and dyspnea.\n",

Bortezomib treatment increases the expression of proapoptotic members such as Bax, Smac and Noxa while anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and IAPs are down-regulated, thus favoring apoptosis in tumor cells (Crawford and Nahta 2011).\n\n",

An extensive protein production and secretion has been found in different types of cancer, becoming more sensitive to ER stress (Hoeller and Dikic 2009). ER stress leads to up-regulation of the endoribonuclease/kinase IRE1a and the transcription factors ATF3&4 that will increase transcriptional activation of the pro-apoptotic Noxa (Armstrong et al. 2010). Autophagy is also induced by ER stress as a resistance mechanism to escape cell death through the eIF2\u03b1 induced pathway, the activation of HDAC6, the IRE1-JNK pathway, by proteasomal stabilization of ATF4, the inhibition of mTOR, and by the reduced proteasomal degradation of LC3 (Belloni et al. 2010). The activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinases has been also reported after proteasome inhibition. This leads to 14-3-3 phosphorylation and consequently to cytochrome c release. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after the treatment with proteasome inhibitors results in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Fan et al. 2011). ROS are responsible for DNA damage and proteasome plays a crucial role in DNA repair through the activation of p53 and other pathways.",

In phase II, 35 % of patients with refractory MM and 46.5 % of patients with pre-treated MCL responded to Bortezomib, therefore the FDA initially approved it for relapsed/refractory MM in 2003, and subsequently for relapsed/refractory MCL in 2006 (Kane et al. 2006). Moreover, survival rates of refractory MM patients using Bortezomib in phase III trials exceeded the response rates for patients treated with the previous drug choice Dexamethasone, resulting in Bortezomib being approved as a first-line therapy in 2008 (Richardson et al. 2005). However the refractory response to Bortezomib depends on the tumour cell type. Pancreatic, prostate and non-small lung tumour cells are sensitive while diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia and some solid tumours such as sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioma only provide slight and short responses (Frankland-Searby and Bhaumik 2012).",

Combinations with Doxorubicin/Adriamycin (ADR), Thalidomide, Melphalan, Dexamethasone, Cyclophosphamide and Myriad have also been successful. The most active combination to date includes Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone, where overall responses of 100 % were obtained in phase II. Early phase I and II clinical trials using combinations of Bortezomib with new immunomodulators, radio-immunotherapy, stem cell transplantation, monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapeutic agents have been promising. In addition, targeted therapies such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, Bcl-2 inhibitors, rapamycin inhibitors, multiple kinase inhibitors (Akt, PKC, CDK inhibitors, etc.) and heat shock protein inhibitors simultaneously used with Bortezomib also show encouraging results (McBride and Ryan 2013).",

            "text": "Because many CRL substrates have tumour suppressor activity, preventing the degradation of these proteins could be an effective anticancer strategy that may also help to reduce toxicities resulting from global proteasomal inhibition (Nawrocki et al. 2012). MLN4924, a potent and selective first-in-class small molecule inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, was reported as a specific inhibitor of protein NEDDylation through the inactivation of the heterodimer APPBP1 (NAE1) and UBA3 (UBE1C), also known as the NEDD8 activating enzyme NAE (Soucy et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011). MLN4924 is an adenosine sulphamate that forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 when bound to the NAE active site and in this way inhibits the formation of UBC12-NEDD8 thioester. The MLN4924-NEDD8 adduct mimics the NEDD8-AMP in situ which is the first intermediate in the NAE reaction cycle, but cannot be enzymatically processed further (Brownell et al. 2010; Nawrocki et al. 2012). MLN4924 inhibits CRL activity and the stabilization of their substrates by blocking NAE, with subsequent implications in cancer cell growth and survival (Bedford et al. 2011). In 2009, MLN4924 was first reported as a potent growth suppressor agent against a variety of cancer cells lines derived from solid tumours and haematological malignancies in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models (Soucy et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2014). During preclinical trials, tumour regression occurs after the action of different mechanisms depending on context and cell type. Induction of apoptosis is one of the reported effects mediated by MLN4924 in three different mechanisms mainly caused by the accumulation and stabilization of CRL substrates like: (1) CDT1, which trigger DNA re-replication and S phase arrest; (2) I\u03baB\u03b1, that blocks NF-\u03baB activation, and; (3) pro-apoptotic NOXA. In addition to apoptosis, MLN4924 also induces autophagy in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in multiple human cancer cell lines derived from carcinomas of breast, colon, liver, brain and cervix. Studies revealed that autophagy is mainly caused by inactivation of mTORC1, most likely mediated by accumulation of DEPTOR and HIF1\u03b1, followed by the activation of the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis. Some studies have also shown that MLN4924 can induce irreversible senescence in multiple cancer cell lines in a p21-dependent manner. In SK-BR3 cells, p16 and p27 accumulation may also contribute to the MLN4924-induced senescence. Furthermore, MLN4924 has a potential sensitizer role in chemotherapy and radiation, involving the mechanistic accumulation of c-Jun, NOXA, CDT1, WEE1 or p21; it also affects the promotion of c-FLIP degradation, increasing the expression of Bcl-2-interacting killer (BIK), inactivating CRL3, as well as the suppression of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation and CHK1 phosphorylation, all of which results in a general increase in cellular sensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and finally apoptosis (Zhao et al. 2014). Despite this promising optimal strategy to inhibit NAE pathway, recently it has been identified that cancer cells can develop resistance to MLN4924 treatment. Resistance has been linked to heterozygous mutations in two areas of NAE\u03b2 (UBA3), the ATP binding pocket at Alanine 171 and at various residues within or close to the NEDD8-binding cleft. A point mutation in residue A171T reduced affinity for both MLN4924 and ATP. Interestingly, such resistance has been effectively bypassed by using a compound with tighter binding properties for NAE. These findings provide critical clinical aspects with respect to patient selection and consolidate efforts for the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors in order to overcome emergent mutations (Milhollen et al. 2012; Toth et al. 2012). In fact, by using a virtual screening approach, a natural product, 6,6\u2033-biapigenin, has been identified and proposed as a second inhibitor of NAE (Leung et al. 2011). In 2012, a cyclometallated rhodium (III) complex was reported as the first metal complex to suppress the NEDDylation pathway via inhibition of NAE, which occupied the same binding pocket as MLN4924 (Zhong et al. 2012).",

Up to now, there are a total of seven Phase I/II clinical trials for MLN4924 in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma, melanoma and several solid tumours. These trials were mainly designed to assess the safety, discomforts and risks of the inhibitor; to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be given to patients; to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects; to evaluate disease response, and to study MLN4924 in combination with other standard treatments. In general, patients received escalating doses of MLN4924 that was administrated via intravenous infusion on different daily schedules. The pharmacokinetics of MLN4924 were measured in serial blood samples, bone marrow aspirates (BMAs), skin punch biopsies, or fine-needle tumour biopsies collected following drug dosing. The samples were analysed to measure MLN4924-NEDD8 covalent adduct and the expression of CRL substrates, such as CDT1, NRF2, and phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1, as the biomarkers to indicate NAE inhibition in peripheral and tumour tissue (Zhao et al. 2014). The PK profiles were similar following dosing on different days, suggesting no apparent accumulation of MLN4924 in plasma with an estimated half-life of 5\u201315 h. In general, most clinical trials carried out thus far have concluded that MLN4924 is well tolerated in the majority of the dosing schedules studied, with evidence of target inhibition and antitumoural activity which supports continued investigation of MLN4924, both alone and in combination strategies as potential treatment for a variety of human cancers (Nawrocki et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2014).\n",

In general, the initial hits have been obtained by high throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries, followed by further optimization using structure-activity relationships (Kramer et al. 2012). Companies like Novartis, Progenra and Hybrigenics have patented compounds inhibiting distinct DUBs (see Table 11.3). Some of them will be presented in the following section.

USP1, one of the best-characterized DUBs, is a regulator of several important steps in the DNA damage response, mainly in Fanconi anaemia (FA), an hereditary disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, genomic instability and increased susceptibility to cancer (Li et al. 2002; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2009). USP1 is frequently overexpressed in tumours like cervical and gastric cancer, melanoma and sarcoma. Importantly, USP1 inhibitors act synergistically with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin to inhibit the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (Chen et al. 2011; Garcia-Santisteban et al. 2013).",

For example, HBX41-108 is a cyano-indenopyrazine derived small molecule compound which modulates the catalytic reaction of USP7 (Colland et al. 2009). USP7, also known as herpes virus-associated USP (HAUSP), is critical in cancer progression because of its destabilizing effect on the tumour suppressor p53 (Cheon and Baek 2006; Cummins and Vogelstein 2004). However, USP7 can also modify other substrates such as claspin, FOXO4 and PTEN, suggesting that USP7 exerts both p53-dependent and -independent effects on the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Faustrup et al. 2009; Song et al. 2008; van der Horst et al. 2006). HBX41-108 treatments stabilize p53, activate transcription of p53-target genes without inducing genotoxic stress, and inhibit cancer cell growth. Another compound more recently developed by Hybrigenics, HBX19-818, is a second-generation of irreversible USP7 inhibitors; it is more specific than HBX41-108, and is capable of regulating USP7 substrates in cancer cells and recapitulating the USP7 knockdown phenotype (Reverdy et al. 2012). Recently, an independent screen performed by Progenra also identified compound P005091, and analogues such as P045204 and P022077, as USP7 inhibitors capable of inducing apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells resistant to both conventional and Bortezomib therapies (Chauhan et al. 2012).",

In the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-coronavirus, a DUB, called the papain-like protease (Plpro), blocks IRF3-dependent antiviral responses (Edelmann et al. 2011; Mielech et al. 2014). A non-covalent inhibitor of PLpro, GRL0617, has been synthesized. This inhibitor modifies the conformation of PLpro, inducing an inhibition of its catalytic activity, and selectively blocks SARS-Coronavirus viral replication without measurable cytotoxic effect (Ratia et al. 2008). Looking for effective therapeutics against severe acute SARS, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG) were found to be specific inhibitors for PLpro. The potential use of 6MP and 6TG as cellular DUB inhibitors has been further studied. The best docking score and binding energy for 6MP and 6TG is against USP14 (Chen et al. 2009; Chou et al. 2008).",

From these studies, non-peptide small molecules inhibitors have been designed to specifically target the hydrophobic pocket including three trivial amino acids (Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26) common to both Mdm2 and MdmX. Hoffmann-La Roche has been the first company to develop one of the most potent Mdm2/p53 inhibitors, namely Nutlins. There are three generations of Nutlins (Nutlin-2; Nutlin-3a; RG-7112), with each generation aiming to improve the stability, affinity and bio-availability of the inhibitor. After optimization of Nutlin-3a, RG-7112 was the first Mdm2 inhibitor used in clinical trials to treat multiple human cancers (Tovar et al. 2013). Other companies like Amgen developed a series of optimized compounds from the piperidinone class of compounds, obtaining AM-8553 that efficiently inhibits tumour regression (Rew et al. 2012). Since 2013, Amgen also developed the Mdm2 inhibitor, AMG-8735, containing a morpholinone core with a significant increase in both potency and metabolic stability compared to the piperidinone series. AMG-8735 emerges as an inhibitor with remarkable biochemical potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Gonzalez et al. 2014) (Table 11.4).",

            "text": "Even if the first pieces of the puzzle of this ATP-dependent pathway were discovered more than 30 years ago, every year new components and regulatory mechanisms controlling this system are being described. Despite this brief didactic view of the UPS classifying enzymes, cofactors and substrates, the system is a lot more complex than presented here, and there is still a distinct lack of knowledge with respect to its overall organization. For instance, it is well known that under certain circumstances several modifying/de-modifying enzymes can act on distinct members of the ubiquitin family (Leidecker et al. 2012), that proteasome subunits can be substrates of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules (Cui et al. 2014), or that the proteasome can also drive proteolysis in the absence of protein modification (Erales and Coffino 2014). Although most of the functional outcomes of recent findings are not completely understood, it becomes clear that simply targeting a single enzyme-substrate pair will be difficult. However, this should not stop the use of these inhibitors to treat distinct pathologies, as has recently occurred with proteasome inhibitors that block multiple processes, since the discovery of drugs acting at different levels will also increase the chances of clinical success. Furthermore, the experience using combinations of different inhibitors is quite positive in cases where patients do not respond or are resistant to the current treatments. Although these combinatorial drug therapies might appear to be in contradiction with the initial aim of reducing undesirable side effects, it is possible that eventually they could be more effective. A compromise between efficacy and cytotoxicity should be better defined by pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic studies. Finally, although we described the use of UPS inhibitors to treat some cancers, many of them have also been used to treat quite diverse diseases such as cardiac, immune and neurodegenerative disorders. The use of chemical inhibitors will contribute to a better understanding of the multiple cellular pathways regulated by the UPS. More importantly, these inhibitors will open up new perspectives for the treatment of various diseases, as has been the case for Bortezomib/Velcade (reviewed by Xolalpa et al. 2013).",
