Not surprisingly, such an attack, irrespective of the agent, defied easy control in the exercise. Issues about the manufacture and distribution of massive amounts of smallpox vaccine dominated the discussion. Three false lessons were conveyed to readers of the ensuing press release, and doubtless to the lay participants: a smallpox pandemic is likely; ordinary methods of public health cannot control person-to-person infections; and vaccine stores are the key to control. Poppycock, poppycock, poppycock!",

Reconstruction of the DNA of the 1918 Spanish virus is not only possible, but also a reality,15 and we can only hope it does not escape into the population. Moreover, the number of human cases of avian influenza in Asia has been increasing.16 The first clear person-to-person transmission of influenza A (H5N1) reported from Thailand17 was even more limited to family members than smallpox or SARS, despite the H5N1 exposure of other family members and hospital staff. As yet there is no change in the host specificity of the viral receptor's binding preference, which would probably enable more efficient human-to-human transmission, but that might be only a matter of time.16\n",
