            "text": "In the past ten years, much evidence has been accumulated t o indicate that chronic neurologic disease may be caused by persistence of viruses that normally produce acute disease [ter Meulen and Katz, 19771 . Exactly how virus persists despite a normal and often enhanced host immune response is still unclear. Even less well understood is the mechanism by which viruses establish latency in the human nervous system [Fenner and White, 19761 and periodically become activated. alitis (SSPE), and that herpes simplex virus is latent in the human nervous system stimulated a search for a viral etiology in relatively common, chronic neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Although a parainfluenza 1(6/94) virus has been isolated from the brains of two patients with MS [ter Meulen et al, 19721 , subsequent attempts at isolation have failed. Furthermore, failure t o isolate cell-associated measles virus from SSPE brain heavlly laden with viral antigen is still a common occurrence [Katz and Koprowski, 19731. The finding that measles virus is the causative agent of subacute sclerosing panenceph-Expansion of the indicator systems and techniques used increases the chances of virus rescue. For example, Cytochalasin treatment of indicator cells has been shown to enhance the rescue of 6/94 virus from latently infected human brain cells [Wroblewska et al, 19781 after cocultivation. Since 6/94 is a parainfluenza virus that infects man most frequently through the respiratory tract, it became of interest to see if this favored entry site would be useful for an in vitro study of virus replication. It has already been shown that for some fastidious coronaviruses, tracheal organ culture (TOC) is the only host system useful for virus propagation in vitro [Tyrell and Hoorn, 1965; Tyrell and Bynoe, 1965; McIntosh et al, 1970; Thomas et al, 1976; Tyrrell et al, 19681 . For these reasons, we decided to study the replication of 6/94 virus in rat TOC and to determine its applicability for rescue of 6/94 virus from latently infected human brain cell cultures.",

By day 10 ciliary beating was markedly decreased, and by day 12 it ceased entirely. Pathological changes were characterized by flattening of epithelial cells and loss of cilia (Figs, LA and 1B) . The kinetics of the release of infectious virus from cultures is illustrated in Figure 2 . Cell-free virus peaked on day 5, and then decreased rapidly, although a small amount of infectious virus was released until day 24 (the total observation time). Cell-associated 6/94 viius, as determined by the ability of 6/94-infected TOC to produce infection in CV, cells (measured by hemadsorption), was detected by day 3, gradually increased until day 13, and was maintained at that level until day 24 p.i. Infectious 6/94 virus could always be obtained from these CV1 cells by cocultivation with a fresh uninfected TOC and subsequent transfer of the TOC to uninfected CV1 cells. Uninfected TOC failed to produce hemadsorption in CV1 cells. In addition, 6/94 viral antigen was seen by indirect immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells and in fibroblasts in the external layer of the tracheal rings from day 8 to day 24 p.i. (Figs. 3A and 3B ). The intensity of the immunofluorescence was greatest at day 14; by day 24 only traces of viral antigen were detectable.",

Infection of rat TOC with 6/94 virus led to the cessation of ciliary activity after 12 days and to the production of infectious virus. This finding is consistent with the observation of Tyrrell and Hoorn that parainfluenza types 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are capable of growing in human and ferret TOC [Tyrrell and Hoorn, 19651 . Of interest is the fact that the only parainfluenza virus capable of damaging ciliary epithelium was the Sendai strain of type 1 parainfluenza virus. The close relationship between the Sendai and 6/94 strains of parainfluenza 1 virus has already been demonstrated [Lief e t al, 19751 . Other RNA viruses, including coronaviruses and influenza virus, will also grow in TOC [McIntosh et al, 1970; Tyrrell and Hoorn, 1965) . Characteristic findings after primary infection include impairment of ciliary function followed by degeneration of cells 4-12 days after infection.",

As has been reported previously, the infectivity of both Sendai and After cocultivation with LIHB or normal (uninfected) human brain cells, TOCs were transferred to uninfected CV1 cells, and 6/94 virus was assayed for b y the ability of medium removcd from the CV1 cells to infect einbryonated hen eggs. 6/94 virus was further identified by liemagglutination-inhibition and indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-6/94 virus immune serum. aNormal human brain. p.i. = post-infection. Homma, 1961; Lief et al, 19751. This was associated with the development of a virus-induced specific glycoprotein in infected mammalian cell cultures [Choppin and Compans, 1975. Virus infectivity could be restored by treatment with trypsin, which produced cleavage of this glycoprotein [Homma, 19711. It is possible that organotypic cultures of trachea, as opposed to dissociated cell cultures, may produce a trypsin-like substance or other proteolytic enzymes that could result in maintenance of virus infectivity. The usefulness of rat TOC as an intermediary for the rescue of virus from latently infected cells cannot be overstated. TOC provides a favorable growth environment for a large number of viruses as well as a system that is capable of rescuing virus from latently infected human brain cells. TOC may be a useful indicator system that could be applied to human tissue suspected of harboring latent virus.",
