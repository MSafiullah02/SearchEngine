            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a major pathogen worldwide, causing significant economic losses to the livestock sector. In Uruguay, BVDV seroprevalence at the farm level is >80%. In this work, 2546 serum, blood or tissue samples collected from animals suspected of being affected by BVD between 2015 and 2017 were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and sequencing. Analysis of the BVDV genomic regions 5'UTR/N pro , N pro and E2 revealed that BVDV-1a, 1i and 2b circulate in the country, with BVDV-1a being the most prevalent subtype. Population dynamics studies revealed that BVDV-1a has been circulating in our herds since ~1990. This subtype began to spread and evolve, accumulating point mutations at a rate of 3.48 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year, acquiring specific genetic characteristics that gave rise to two local genetic lineages of BVDV-1a. These lineages are divergent from those circulating worldwide, as well as the vaccine strain currently used in Uruguay. The most notable differences between field and vaccine strains were found in the E2 glycoprotein, suggesting that the amino acid substitutions could result in failure of cross-protection/neutralization after vaccination. This is the first study that compares Uruguayan BVDV field and vaccine strains with other BVDV strains from throughout the world. The results obtained in this study will be very useful for developing a suitable immunization program for BVDV in Uruguay by identifying local field strains as candidates for vaccine development.",

Currently, the 5'UTR is the main genomic region used for this purpose. Analysis of this genomic region has allowed the demarcation of BVDV species. However, due to its short length and high nucleotide conservation level, BVDV-1 subtypes usually cannot be easily defined, sometimes leading to incorrect subtype assignment [17, 18] . The use of 5'UTR/N pro allows proper assignment of BVDV strains to the different species and subtypes of BVDV [19] . Alternatively, the E2 glycoprotein, which is 1122 nucleotides in length, has been also used for this purpose. E2 is a less-conserved genomic region, and the most variable region of E2 is the amino-terminal end. The DA and DB domains of the E2 protein (residues 4-87 and 88-164, respectively), are the most exposed on the virus surface and therefore contain the main antigenic sites of the virion [20, 21] . Due to its variability, phylogenetic studies carried out with E2 have shown higher resolution than those based on other genomic regions. Additionally, comparative analysis of field and vaccine strains has been useful for discovering strains that are capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies [22] .",

Research studies carried out in Uruguay in 2000 revealed that only 3% of farmers vaccinated cattle against BVDV. BVDV was found on 100% of the farms studied, and a seroprevalence of 67% was found in cattle [39] . These data were updated recently with similar values of seroprevalence at the farm level (98.8%) and higher seroprevalence at the herd level (approximately 80%, Dr. Federico Fern\u00e1ndez, Ministerio de Ganader\u00eda, Agricultura y Pesca, MGAP, personal communication).

            "text": "In order to obtain more-detailed information on the divergence between the NADL vaccine strain and the Uruguayan BVDV-1a strains, we analyzed the amino-terminal region of glycoprotein E2. This region is more variable than the N pro region due to its role in the replicative cycle of the virus. The amino-terminal region of E2 is the most exposed region on the surface of the virus and therefore is the most antigenic region of this protein [20] . In the E2 region, most of the nucleotide changes are non-synonymous and lead to amino acid changes (see Table 2 ). In this region, 11 amino acid changes were found when comparing the two Uruguayan lineages of BVDV-1a and the NADL strain, revealing a significant degree of genetic variability among vaccine strain and strains circulating in Uruguay (Table 3b , Fig. 4 ). Substitutions at residues 71, 87, 88 and 90 found in the two BVDV-1a lineages circulating in Uruguay relative to the NADL strain are part of two epitopes of E2 [20, 35] . Therefore, these substitutions in glycoprotein E2 of the Uruguayan strains could lead to a protection/neutralization failure in animals vaccinated with the NADL strain. More studies will be needed to address this important issue.",
