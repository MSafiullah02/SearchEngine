It is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belonging to the Avulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is an enveloped virus having linear, non-segmented single-stranded RNA of negative polarity [1] . Based on the genome size, strains of NDV are classified into 3 groups having 15186, 15192, and 15198 nucleotides [2] [3] [4] [5] . The genome of NDV has six transcriptional units, comprising nucleocapsid protein (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), fusion protein (F), haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), and large polymerase protein (L) from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. The N and P, along with L, forms an RNA polymerase complex for the viral genome replication [6] .",

Furthermore, based on the tissue tropism, it can be further classified as viscerotropic velogenic, which produces lethal haemorrhagic lesions in the viscera and neurotropic velogenic that cause respiratory and neurological disorders [8] . The clinical signs of the infection vary depending on the virus, host species, the age of the host, infection with other organisms, environmental stress, and immune status. The average incubation time of the virus is 15-21 days and can be transmitted easily, causing significant loss to the poultry industry [9] . It can cause a substantial economic loss by reduced egg production and the death of the ailing birds. There are live, inactivated, and vectored vaccines that are available for the prevention of the disease in poultry [10, 11] . Among these, the traditional live vaccines such as LaSota, B1, and VG/GA strains are commonly used in the endemic areas [12, 13] . However, vaccine failures have been frequently reported due to the emergence of its variant strains [14] . There is no available drug against NDV; the reason why the development of the antiviral drug is of prime importance.",

            "text": "Nitazoxanide (NTZ), also known as 2-(acetyloxy)-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl) benzamide is a commercially available antiprotozoal drug which was initially developed for the cure of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis [15] . NTZ has also been classified as a broad-spectrum firstclass antiviral compound against the respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Sendai virus, coronavirus, rotavirus, and norovirus infection [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Additionally, NTZ has been shown to inhibit hepatitis viruses [21, 22] , flaviviruses [23] [24] [25] , chikungunya virus [26] , human immunodeficiency virus [27] and vaccinia virus [28] . Clinical trials are under progress for the use of NTZ against influenza and its subtypes [29, 30] . Several mechanisms of action have been suggested for NTZ mediated viral inhibition. It can curtail influenza virus replication by inhibiting the maturation of hemagglutinin protein [29] . In the Sendai virus, the active metabolite of NTZ acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of ER-resident proteins to misfold the F protein and halts its trafficking towards the plasma membrane [17] . The reduction in the size of viroplasm was observed against rotavirus, which led to a decrease in the formation of dsRNA [31] . As an anti-hepatitis C compound, NTZ was shown to activate protein kinase R (PKR), resulting in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2-\u03b1) [32] . NTZ blocks the replication of bovine viral diarrhoea virus by causing stress in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to depletion of ATP sensitive intracellular Ca 2+ stores [33] . However, the effect of NTZ on NDV biology has not been addressed to date. The present study reports the inhibition of NDV upon NTZ treatment on chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), embryonated chicken eggs, and two-week old chickens.",

The significant reduction in the viral genes further confirmed the blocking of viral replication. Effect of NTZ against rubella virus replication has been previously reported showing the reduction of RNA transcription of viral genes [43] . We found a reduction in the expression of viral genes in accordance with the earlier report; however, further experimentation is required to understand whether NTZ blocks the transcription of mRNA or whether the reduced gene expression is due to lower infectivity. Our data suggested a decrease in viral structural and non-structural proteins post-NTZ treatment, which could perhaps have perturbed the effective assembly of the NDV virion in the cytoplasm. Earlier reports suggested inhibition of enveloped viruses by downregulating the structural and non-structural proteins [24, 42] . However, we did not get an appreciated protein level post 24 h of NDV infection, which could be due to a lesser viral protein that falls below the detection threshold.",

The infection by rNDV-GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy at 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h post infection. The total cell lysates were collected using lysis buffer 48 h post infection along with the mock infected and NTZ controls. Protein expression was analyzed with the lysates collected using HN and N specific monoclonal antibodies (a kind gift from Dr. R Iorio, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA, USA). The NDV titer post NTZ treatment was quantified using a plaque assay. Additionally, TCID 50 assay was performed with the cell culture supernatant collected every 8 h till 96 h to analyze the growth kinetics of the virus in the presence of NTZ.The total RNA was isolated from the DF-1 cells infected with NDV using RNAiso plus reagent (Takara Bio, India) with and without NTZ treatment. cDNA was prepared using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA). SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) was used to quantify the gene expression levels with GAPDH as an internal control. The relative gene expression values were determined using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method relative to mock, and each experiment was performed in triplicates. Protein lysates were collected at 24 h and 48 h post virus infection along with the mock infected and NTZ controls. The media was then discarded, and the cell lysate was collected with RIPA lysis buffer containing 1x ProteoGuard EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail (Clontech, USA). Cell lysates were stored at -80 0 C till use. The NDV protein expression was analyzed by western blotting using NDV gene specific monoclonal antibodies.In ovo studiesThe 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with NDV (MOI of 0.01) and NTZ with a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcM. Four groups of eggs were used in the experiment: uninfected control, NDV control, NTZ control, and NTZ treated along with NDV inoculation. The eggs were incubated at 37\u00b0C with regular candling until 48 h post inoculation after which the eggs were kept at 4\u00b0C to harvest the embryo and the allantoic fluid. The titration of the virus from the allantoic fluid was done using a plaque assay, as described previously. Further, the embryos were examined for pathological lesions, which are indicative of NDV infection, and the tissue samples were collected from the embryos, which was used for virus quantification and gene expression studies.Cytokine profilingDifferential gene expression of host cytokines viz., IL18, TLR7, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 on NTZ treatment was evaluated on DF-1 cells, PBMC, and chicken embryo tissue samples. 5x 10 5 DF-1 cells were seeded in 6 well plates, and total RNA lysates were collected at 12 and 24 h post NTZ treatment at a final concentration of 12.5 \u00b5M. PBMC was collected by bleeding SPF chickens into tubes with EDTA; blood was carefully layered on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 min.The white layer containing PBMC was collected and washed in serum free DMEM three times, and 5 x 10 7 cells were seeded in 6 well plate. After overnight incubation, PBMC was treated with NTZ at a final concentration of 12.5 \u00b5M, and RNA lysates were collected at 12 and 24 h post-treatment. 500 mg of chicken embryo tissue was collected from the NTZ treated and mock treated groups from in ovo experiment 48 h post-treatment.

On day 1, virus and virus with NTZ groups were infected with 50 \u00b5l of 1:500 dilution of 5 x 10 8 PFU/ml NDV through the oral-nasal route. On day 4, all the birds were sacrificed, followed by the collection of trachea, lungs, and spleen for viral estimation by tissue titration. Briefly, 200 mg of each organ was triturated with an equal volume of DMEM with 10x antibiotic solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes to settle down the tissue material, and the supernatant was transferred in fresh tubes.

To directly visualize the effect of NTZ, the rNDV-GFP was used, and a significant viral reduction in post NTZ treatment was observed as compared to the pre-and co-treatment (Figure 2b). The antiviral effect of NTZ sustained until 48 h post NTZ treatment, whereas it was not visualized in the pre and co-treatment conditions. Growth kinetics was performed to monitor the release of NDV progeny, which showed complete inhibition of NDV post NTZ treatment until 96 h(Figure 2c). It was observed that in other conditions of pre and co-treatment, the NDV replication in the initial time points was less but later became equal to the NDV control. The results obtained in the growth kinetics of NDV were further corroborated by plaque assay. In pre-treatment of NTZ, approximately 30% of NDV reduction was observed. The reduction of NDV in the posttreatment of NTZ was found to be 65%(Figures 2d and 2e), whereas it was not significant in the co-treatment conditions. From the results obtained, it was concluded that NTZ was effective in reducing NDV when it is post-treated, and therefore, for further experiments post-treatment of NTZ was preferred.The infection of DF-1 cells with the rNDV-GFP showed a reduction in a dose and time-dependent manner(Figure 3a). A significant reduction was observed in the NTZ treated DF-1 cells at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcM as compared to the untreated and mock infected controls. The NDV reduction, when treated with NTZ, was further confirmed by analyzing protein expression using western blotting(Figure 3b). Furthermore, the NDV quantification by plaque assay showed a reduction of 50% as compared to the virus control upon 12.5 \u03bcM treatment of NTZ(Figures 3c and 3d). A dose-dependent NTZ treatment showed a reduction of virus titer in the growth kinetics(Figure 3e). No viral load was observed in the cells treated with NTZ at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcM.

            "text": ", NTZ treatment upregulated type I interferons suggesting that the innate immune modulation could help effectively to clear the NDV from the host. However, the effect could be appreciated only at the level of transcription due to the unavailability of chicken specific antibodies. A significant reduction of the virus in NTZ treated groups was observed as compared to non-treated infected birds. The pre-treatment group was found to be the most effective NTZ treated group. Decreased viral replication in the trachea and lungs indicates that NTZ is more effective by enhancing the immune system for the rapid clearance of the virus. Spleen did not show any virus even in the virus control group suggesting that the virus spreads only in trachea and lungs.Repurposing of the drug as an antiviral has been less explored and neglected to a large extent. The present study demonstrates that NTZ can be repurposed as an antiviral against NDV infection. The possible mechanisms in which the drug acts might be through the stimulation of cytokines. The results presented in the current work is a step towards understanding the drug induced modulation of host immune response, which could be explored to design effective therapeutics against NDV infection in chicken. Although, there might be several other ways by which NTZ could modulate the host system to curtail viral infectivity. Perhaps in a limited way, the study will benefit to use NTZ as an antiviral for other poultry pathogens.Conflict of Interest:Figure legends",
