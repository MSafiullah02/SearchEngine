This intuitive recommendation is also based on observational studies that have been carried out in the emergency department [5, 6]. In contrast, a randomized study, showed that the pre-hospital administration of antibiotics in septic patients did not reduce the mortality [7]. Furthermore, in a prospective cohort of ICU patients with bacteremia, early initiation and appropriateness of antibiotic intervention were not found to impact mortality when adequately adjusted for confounders [8]. Additionally, a pooled analysis of the current literature failed to demonstrate a survival benefit related to antibiotic administration within the first hour or within the first 3 h following a diagnosis of sepsis [9].",

Interestingly, when antibiotics were administered following the diagnosis of shock (mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg), the mortality of the aggressively-treated group was higher than that of the conservatively-treated group (66% vs. 25%, P < 0.0004). The authors presented several plausible factors to explain these findings. The adequacy of initial antibiotic treatment was lower in the aggressively-treated group, which therefore extended the antibiotics exposure. Moreover, the waiting time for blood cultures and observation of the clinical course may also disclose alternative diagnosis to infections. At last, up to 25% of patients initially diagnosed as septic shock did not have an identified infection 24 h after their initial diagnosis [11].",

De-escalation decreases the time of antibiotic use, but a short exposure still exists; in this way, a single antibiotic dose may be enough to treat severe infections such as meningococcal meningitis [17], and to promote profound and sustained microbiome unbalances, therefore facilitating opportunistic infections and damping the potential benefit of the de-escalation approach [18].",
