            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a ubiquitous, highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that inflicts serious economic losses to the commercial poultry industry worldwide. IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus in the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2012). It has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kilobases in length that encodes four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S). Serotype and genotype classifications, which are usually based on features of the S1 part of the S protein gene, are used to classify IBV strains (de Wit, 2000). Furthermore, recombination may be involved in the evolution of IBV, and it probably occurs at many positions within a given genome during mixed infections (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997).",

However, many IBV serotypes have arisen and disappeared in the poultry industry since then (Cook et al., 2012). The control of IB is mostly accomplished through the use of live attenuated vaccines. The use of commercially produced Mass-type modified live virus vaccines began in the 1950s and has continued to this day. This type of vaccines, such as the Mass strains M41 and H120, are the most commonly used around the world because such vaccines have proven to be capable of protecting against a wide range of IBV strains (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). However, the Mass-type of IBVs is constantly isolated from chicken flocks with respiratory clinical signs.",

For the ck/CH/LSD/111219 isolate, only the nucleotide sequence encoding the S protein showed identity with that of the H120 strain, and, the remaining sequences showed a close relationship with those of the DY07 strain, which belonged to LX4-type and was isolated in China in 2007 (He et al., 2012). The nucleotide sequence from the M gene to the 3\u2032 end of the genome of isolate ck/CH/LHB/130598 was closely related to that of the 4/91 strain.

            "text": "In this study, 418 IBVs were isolated using 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos from samples collected from 1717 chicken flocks (\u224824.5%) suspected to be infected with IBVs, and 29 out of the 418 IBV isolates (\u22487%) belonged to the Mass genotype. The lower proportion of the Mass genotype IBV in the samples collected in this study was not surprising because Mass-based live IBV vaccines are used extensively in China. It is generally believed that if a virus of this type is isolated from a Mass-vaccinated flock with respiratory clinical signs, it is likely the reisolated vaccine virus and that some other serotype of IBV, even some other viruses must be responsible for the respiratory disease. This was the case in this study because 24 out of the 31 Mass-type IBVs appeared to be H120-like strains by genomic sequence analysis, although insertions were found in the genome of three out of these 24 H120-like strains. However, the isolation of two M41-like viruses from two diseased chicken flocks was somewhat unexpected, as all the flocks had been vaccinated with Mass-based live vaccines. Molecular studies have shown that an amino acid substitution at position 63 of the S1 subunit of the spike protein in the M41 strain can result in escape mutants (Cavanagh et al., 1988). In this study, we did not find this substitution in the S1 subunit of our two M41-like isolates, indicating that the vaccination failure in the two flocks was not due to a mutation in the S1 gene at this site.",

An H120-like virus was predicted to be one of the parental viruses for each of the recombinant viruses. This is not surprising because the H120 vaccine virus is commonly used in China. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of S1 subunit of all the recombinant viruses was predicted to be derived from an H120-like virus because all the viruses were primarily screened by Mass type-specific RT-PCR, the primers for which targeted the S1 subunit region (Cavanagh et al., 1999). Five IBV strains, including DY07-, 4/91-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-, ck/CH/LHB/100801- and Conn-like viruses, were predicted to be parental viruses for each of the isolates. In China, DY07-, tl/CH/LDT3/03- and ck/CH/LHB/100801-like viruses have been found to be prevalent in chicken flocks in recent years (Liu et al., 2005, Han et al., 2011, Ma et al., 2012). Vaccine 4/91 was used in China for many years, although only a few field strains of this type were isolated. Interestingly, no Conn-like viruses have been isolated in China thus far; however, similar to a previous report (Liu et al., 2014), the ck/CH/LDL/110931 isolate was found to be a naturally recombinant virus that arose from Conn-like and H120-like viruses.",

For the remaining three viruses, ck/CH/LDL/110931, ck/CH/LHB/130573, and ck/CH/LHB/130598, only one breakpoint was identified. The recombination event may have involved only two parental viral strains with RNA replication initiating in an H120-like template of either negative or positive polarity, followed by switching of the polymerase-nascent cRNA complex to a Conn-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-, and 4/91-like virus template, respectively.",

In the present study, this correlation was confirmed by an analysis of the IBV strains ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219 and ck/CH/LHB/130598. However, two other strains, ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573, although they shared nearly the same sequences in the HVR1/2 regions with that of the H120 strain, had different serotypes than the H120 strain and vaccination with the H120 strain did not provide protection against challenges with these two strains, as evaluated by tracheal virus shedding. It is believed that only a small number of amino acids changes in the S1 domain are sufficient to change the serotype of the virus and affect cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1992). We compared the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit and found that a mutation at nucleotide 118 resulted in a change from a G residue in Mass viruses to a V residue in the ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573 isolates. Alternatively, it was reported that amino acid differences were responsible for the different secondary structures of the S2 subunit of IBVs, which might result in different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits and which might affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype-specific epitopes are located, therefore accounting for serologic differences (Callison et al., 1999). We cannot conclude that the substitution in S1 and/or amino acid differences in the S2 subunits contributed to the serotype change of the two isolates in this study, as this will require further investigations using reverse genetic and virus cross-neutralization tests.",
