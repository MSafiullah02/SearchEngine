As a group, transplant patients present a real challenge for initial diagnosis of infection partly due to lowered or absent markers of inflammation [2]. Traditionally, these infections have been diagnosed using bacterial, fungal, and viral culture as well as a variety of immunological assays. These methods still remain the standard of care for diagnosis of most infections. However, a series of advanced detection techniques led by nucleic acid amplification have now become prominent in most clinical microbiology laboratories, and novel proteomic assays are currently being added in the list of diagnostic tools available for infectious pathogen detection and identification.",

            "text": "Culture\nremains the gold standard for the diagnosis of most infectious diseases including those caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi [3, 4]. One of the advantages of culture is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the specific pathogen responsible for the infection as it casts a wide search net by using multiple growth media and incubation conditions. For example, diarrhea and vomiting are common symptoms in transplant patients, and determining the infectious cause for those symptoms can be challenging due to confounding factors such as intestinal graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, neutropenic enterocolitis, and immunosuppressive drugs [5]. A request for a bacterial stool culture will allow detection of the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, namely, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species, and E. coli O157 with a recovery rate ranging from 0.2% to 2.4% [3, 6\u20138]. In addition, any other bacterial organisms growing on the culture media, with potential for causing gastrointestinal symptoms, will be detected and reported. However, culture of certain organisms, including C. difficile, the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in hospitalized patients, requires special culture media and setup and has been replaced in most part by non-culture-based methods. Similarly, viral causes of diarrhea including cytomegalovirus (CMV), norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and other small round viruses are better detected by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and antigen tests [9\u201311].",

In contrast, the use of PCR tests and antigen testing increased the overall diagnostic yield to 22%, although the increased detection of CMV by PCR was not deemed clinically significance for all cases. The diagnostic yield of BAL in other studies was higher with one study reporting rates of 31%, 12.7%, and 23.6% for detection of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, respectively, in cancer patients [12]. For solid organ transplants (SOT), the overall recovery of pathogens by culture can be higher, up to 58.9% in lung transplants [13\u201315].",

Current blood culture systems are automated and set up to continuously monitor blood culture for the detection of microorganisms. An exception to continuous monitoring is the use of the isolator tube system, a manual lysis-centrifugation system (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ). Performance of the isolator tube has been evaluated extensively against other automated blood culture systems designed to improve recovery of fungi such as the MYCO/F Lytic bottle (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) with some studies showing increased recovery of H. capsulatum and C. neoformans [21, 22], while other concludes that the two systems performed equally well [23, 24]. A study by Creger et al. retrospectively analyzed the performance of the isolator tube system specifically in a cancer population and did not observed an advantage over conventional blood culture methods [25]. Even with the use of the isolator tube, the detection of fungi in blood culture is low, and in biopsy-proven candidiasis, only 50% of patients had a positive blood culture [26].",

Using Bayesian LCM with either conditional independence (i.e., no single test considered gold standard and no correlation among tests) or conditional dependence (i.e., correlation among all tests), the sensitivity of culture was estimated to be 61% with a negative predictive value of 62.1% [41].

            "text": "The serum GM assay (Platelia Aspergillus EIA, Bio-Rad Laboratories) was approved by the United States Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in 2003. The assay is an enzyme immunoassay that uses rat monoclonal antibody EBA-2 to detect circulating GM antigen in serum. The GM assay has been evaluated extensively in various patient populations with sensitivity ranging from 30% to 100% and specificity ranging from 38% to 98% in serum with greater utility in HSCT patients than in SOT recipients [46]. In a study by Jathavedam and colleagues, the GM assay was shown to have limited utility within the first 100 days after auto-SCT and therefore not useful for patient management decision [47]. In another study conducted in patients with hematologic malignancies, the sensitivity of the GM assay was 49% for invasive fungal infections caused by Aspergillus species other than A. fumigatus and only 13% for IFD caused by A. fumigatus [48]. Results of these various studies suggested that the performance of the GM assay depends on several factors including the infecting species of Aspergillus, the type of transplant populations, the frequency of testing, and the duration of antifungal therapy [45, 49]. The sensitivity of the GM assay in BAL of HSCT recipients and patients with hematological malignancies is higher than that reported for serum and ranges between 88% and 100% using the same optical density cutoff value used for serum [45, 50, 51]. In solid-organ transplant patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the GM assay in BAL ranged from 60% to 100% and 84\u201398%, respectively, depending on the optical density cutoff value used [50, 52\u201356]. Thus, the GM assay in BAL is a useful additional test for diagnosing IFD. False-positive results were observed in patients receiving piperacillin, amoxicillin, or ticarcillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor, in patients being administered electrolyte replacement fluids (i.e., PlasmaLyte), and in patients infected with molds other than Aspergillus for a low specificity and positive predictive value [45, 57]. However, a study by Vergidis et al. showed that the current formulation of piperacillin-tazobactam do not appear to be contaminated with galactomannan [58].",

A recent meta-analysis review of studies conducted in adult hemato-oncology patients showed similar performance for all four assays in the diagnosis of IFD, a higher diagnostic yield for performance of two consecutive tests, and an overall low sensitivity (52%) and high specificity (99%) for proven or probable IFD [59]. In another meta-analysis study, which included reports with various patient populations, the sensitivity and specificity of the BD glucans test were 77% and 85%, respectively [60]. Both studies concluded that the BD glucans assay was a useful adjunct test, especially for diagnosis of IFD due to Candida and Aspergillus.

Although useful, these methods can lack specificity, be time-consuming, or result in inconclusive findings. A study by Lin et al. [102] suggested that earlier diagnosis of fungal infection could result in decreased mortality in neutropenic and cancer patients. Molecular diagnosis of fungal infections has relied mostly on the identification of organisms growing in culture. Nucleic acid hybridization probes for identification of Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Coccidioides immitis from culture isolates have been available since the early 1990s (AccuProbes, Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) with sensitivity ranging from 87.8 to 100% and specificity nearing 100% [103, 104]. The hybridization probes are rapid and demonstrate good sensitivity and specificity from culture, although some cross-reactivity with uncommon fungal organisms has been reported [104, 105]. More recently, peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) probes and syndromic panel for bloodstream infections (FilmArray Blood Culture ID panel) have become available for rapid identification of C. albicans/Candida parapsilosis, C. glabrata/Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis from positive blood cultures [91, 106\u2013108].",

However, the biggest challenge associated with the use of these laboratory-developed quantitative assays is the inability to compare viral load results obtained across laboratories due to differences in genomic target (single vs multi-copy genes), extraction methods (manual vs automated), detection platforms, and lack of international standards and calibrators [139]. These limitations of quantitative assays have made the establishment of useful quantitative threshold for treatment difficult to establish [140\u2013145]. The recent introduction of the first World Health Organization (WHO) international standards for cytomegalovirus [146] and Epstein-Barr viruses [147] as well as the availability of the first FDA-approved commercial real-time quantitative assay for monitoring of CMV viral loads was aimed at decreasing the variability in viral loads measured across methods, but a recent study by Hayden et al. showed that although improved, the standardization challenge remains in the field [148].",

The configuration of these assays varies from single target to highly multiplexed assays. The first FDA-cleared multiplexed molecular assay for respiratory viruses, the xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada), targets 12 viruses and subtypes (respiratory syncytial viruses A and B; influenza A (H1 subtype, H3 subtype, and untypeable); influenza B; parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus; and enterovirus/rhinovirus). This assay provided a significant improvement in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections compared to conventional method and was instrumental in the rapid diagnosis of influenza A H1N1 during the 2009 outbreak in New York City [150, 151]. Additional multiplex molecular assays have since been approved including the FilmArray Respiratory Viral Panel (FA RVP) (BioFire Diagnostic Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah) FDA cleared for the detection of 17 viruses and subtypes including the virus targets in xTAG RVP plus human coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43) and parainfluenza 4 as well as three bacterial targets: Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Multiple studies have been published comparing these highly multiplexed assays against each other, against monoplexed assays, and against traditional methods in various patient populations [152\u2013157]. Results have shown comparable performance with overall sensitivity and specificity between 90% and 100%, although differences were detected for specific targets including adenoviruses, which are detected with higher sensitivity by single target assays than by highly multiplexed PCR [156]. Other molecular devices for detection and identification of a panel of respiratory viral pathogens are also commercially available from several manufacturers including Gen-Probes (Prodesse assays), Focus Diagnostics (Simplexa assays), and Nanosphere, Inc. (Verigene assays) [158, 159].",

Unlike the results of a function-based testing method, such as mycobacterial cultures, in the clinical setting, a positive PCR result after antituberculosis therapy does not necessarily mean treatment failure. Therefore, DNA-targeted molecular assays are usually not considered to be tests of cure. This is also true for sexually transmitted pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae [164]. A positive result may reflect treatment failure with persistent infection but may also reflect resolved infection by detecting the mere presence of ribosomal RNA debris and nonviable C. trachomatis DNA [165].",

For monitoring efficacy of therapy, mRNA RT-PCR results paralleled well with those of culture at the follow-up time points [163]. Another study further demonstrated sputum M. tuberculosis mRNA is a reliable marker of bacteriologic clearance in response to several mono or combined antituberculosis therapies [162]. Nucleic acid amplification assays targeting microbial mRNA have also been used for diagnosis and assessment of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Several reports have shown not only the ubiquitous presence of E6 and E7 mRNA in cervical cancer but also a quantitative difference in the overexpression of E6/E7 depending on the severity of the cervical lesion [171]. Several E6 and E7 mRNA qualitative assays including Aptima (Gen-Probe), NucliSENS EasyQ HPV (bioM\u00e9rieux), and PreTect HPV-Proofer (NorChip) have been reported to improve the low specificity and positive predictive value of HPV DNA assays [172].",

Another novel approach known as RNA-seq, which uses next-generation sequencing technologies to generate transcriptome profiling [173], is starting to come into the diagnostic microbiology field [174, 175]. Using dual-species transcriptional profiling in a murine model of systemic candidiasis, Hebecker et al. observed a delayed transcriptional immune response accompanied by late induction of fungal stress response genes in the kidneys. In contrast, early upregulation of the proinflammatory response in the liver was associated with a fungal transcriptome resembling response to phagocytosis, suggesting that phagocytes contribute significantly to fungal control in the liver [176]. Rasmussen et al. combined longitudinal, dimensionality reduction and categorical analysis of the transcriptome from 111 liver biopsy specimens taken from 57 HCV-infected patients over time and identified alterations in gene expression that occur before histologic evidence of liver disease progression, suggesting that events that occur during the acute phase of infection influence patient outcome [177].",

Currently, there are limited methods which can be used to differentiate and overcome the DNA contamination when mRNA targets are tested. Theoretically, specimens can be pre-treated with DNAase prior to the mRNA amplification and detection [178, 179]. However, absolutely RNase-free DNAase is rarely available to actually do the job. Designing primers/probes to cover RNA splicing sites has been demonstrated efficient if relevant RNA splicing sites are available in targeted bacteria and viruses [180, 181]. Indirect methods have been reported to determine antimicrobial susceptibility by selectively detecting viable microorganisms. This assay uses a DNA-binding dye that penetrates damaged bacterial cells and renders DNA un-amplifiable, thereby decreasing background amplification from killed organisms [182, 183].",

The separation of various molecules depends on the time of flight, which is reversely proportional to the mass of molecules. After detection signals are processed and interpreted into the mass spectra, the characteristic mass peaks are used to characterize and eventually identify the microorganisms. By measuring the exact sizes of peptides and small proteins, which are assumed to be characteristic for each bacterial species, it is possible to determine the species within a few minutes of when the analysis is started with whole cells, cell lysates, or crude bacterial extracts [184\u2013186].",

            "text": "In addition to rapid identification of microorganisms, MALDI-TOF MS has been explored for determining epidemic relatedness and antibiotic resistance of microbial isolates. The utility of MALDI-TOF MS for microbial typing was investigated in Staphylococcus aureus in two recent studies. The composition correlation index analysis of the MALDI-TOF MS data demonstrated the similar inter-strain relatedness found with the standard typing methods used to confirm the outbreak [198, 199]. These data indicated that this technology is a potential rapid screening tool for nosocomial infection investigations. The MALDI-TOF MS was capable of rapidly and accurately identifying mecA-positive S. aureus and vanB-positive Enterococcus faecium from susceptible isolates [200, 201]. The MALDI-TOF MS has been directly used to determine mechanisms of antibiotic resistance [202]. Bittar et al. described the use of a MALDI-TOF MS profile and a ClinPro Tools software to detect and identify staphylococcal Panton-Valentine leukocidin [203]. The detection and identification of a series of \u03b2-lactamases from Gram-negative bacilli by MALDI-TOF MS seem to be a powerful, quick, and cost-effective method for clinical microbiology laboratories [204\u2013207]. These studies represented a proof of concept for the use of MALDI-TOF MS technology as a rapid method to timely monitoring microbial infections.",

For the use and value of procalcitonin in SOT transplantation, the existing literature suggests reasonable sensitivity and specificity for the PCT test in identifying infection complications among patients undergoing transplantation . Monitoring PCT in the early posttransplant period seems to be a promising method for early detection of infectious complications; however, given the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the PCT test, medical decisions should be based on both PCT test results and clinical findings [209, 210]. Recently, van Houten et al. reported the use of a three-host protein (TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP)-based assay to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in children with lower respiratory tract infection or fever without source [211].",

Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been the mainstay for the detection and characterization of VOCs produced by a panel of Gram-negative bacilli [214\u2013216]. Unique GC-MS VOCs were found to be produced by five Aspergillus species such as A. fumigatus, A. versicolor, A. sydowii, A. flavus, and A. niger cultivated on malt extract agar and gypsum board [217]. In another study, 2-Pentylfuran (2PF) was consistently detected in the media of A. fumigatus, Fusarium spp., A. terreus, and A. flavus and to a lesser extent by A. niger. 2PF was detected in breath samples from 4/4 patients with cystic fibrosis and A. fumigatus colonization, 3/7 patients with cystic fibrosis but no microbiological evidence of A. fumigatus, and none of the 10 healthy controls [218]. Using thermal desorption-GC-MS, Koo et al. characterized\nthe in vitro volatile metabolite profile of A. fumigatus. A pathogen-specific metabolic signature combined with \u03b2-trans-bergamotene, \u03b1-trans-bergamotene, a \u03b2-vatirenene-like sesquiterpene, and trans-geranylacetone accurately discriminated patients with IA from patients\nwith other pneumonia [219].

For recipients with acute CMV infection indicated by positive CMV IgM (negative IgG), transplant may be delayed, and treatment may be required. The CMV serostatus of the recipient is the most important predictor for development of CMV infection posttransplant. Combined results of donor and recipient serology is used to optimize donor selection [224] . Given the availability several donors with similar degree of HLA match, preference is given to donor matching the CMV serostatus of the recipient. For CMV-seronegative patients, the use of a CMV-seronegative donor alleviates the risk of CMV transmission through the allograft [225]. CMV-seropositive recipients who receive conventional allografts from CMV-seropositive donors are receiving CMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) contained in the allograft. Lymphocytes from CMV-seropositive donors can also be used to generate ex vivo CMV CTL for adoptive immunotherapy posttransplant [226]. The CMV serostatus of donor and recipient also determines the need for posttransplant serial monitoring for CMV. Recipients who are CMV positive or receive grafts of CMV-seropositive donors are monitored by CMV PCR, and preemptive therapy is initiated, if CMV infection occurs [227]. Another approach is antiviral prophylaxis for CMV for high-risk groups such as recipients of mismatched or T-cell-depleted allografts [228]. It will be interesting to assess whether CMV monitoring by the PCR will eliminate survival differences between CMV-seropositive and CMV-seronegative recipients.",

Green et al. reported that transition of preemptive therapy strategy from antigenemia to PCR-based monitoring and host risk factors successfully prevented CMV disease without increasing the proportion of patients receiving preemptive therapy and attributable toxicity [238]. The performance characteristics of individual CMV PCR assays vary; thus cutoff values and thresholds for treatment are not comparable among laboratories [145]. The availability of the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) International Standard (IS) for CMV for nucleic acid amplification techniques is an important development for decreases variance between laboratories and enables to develop international clinical practice guideline [227]. Even with the WHO standardized assay, there is considerable variability (up to 1.5 log10 IU/mL) in different determinations of viral load from the same specimen [239].",

Some studies have shown a relationship between the magnitude of urine BKV viral load and development of hemorrhagic cystitis [253\u2013255]. However the concentrations of virus vary widely and often overlap with patients who do not develop hemorrhagic cystitis. Unfortunately, no effective therapy is currently available for the prevention or treatment of symptoms associated with BKV, in large part due to a lack of understanding about its etiology and pathogenesis [256\u2013261]. It is likely that the pathophysiology of cystitis in this setting is multifactorial with BKV reactivation as a contributing factor. The level of BKV viruria in HSCT exceeds by several logs the levels observed in renal transplants [250, 251, 254, 262]. Reduction of immunosuppression, the mainstay for management in renal transplantation, is not an option in the allogeneic HSCT due to the risk of triggering or exacerbating graft-versus-host disease. Despite the lack of established guidelines for the interpretation of BKV PCR results in HSCT and paucity of therapeutic measures for BKV in HSCT, BKV PCR is frequently ordered in symptomatic patients.",

In univariate analyses, high BKV viral load (\u22651.0 \u00d7 107 copies/mL) and older age were predictors of hemorrhagic cystitis. During the study period, 36 patients died and 8 patients had autopsies performed. One patient was found to have BKVN at autopsy. Our findings suggest that factors in addition to BKV are likely involved in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic cystitis posttransplant. At present, we do not recommend monitoring asymptomatic patients for BKV in urine. In patients with symptoms of cystitis and no other identified etiology, we suggest checking BKV PCR once. We discourage monitoring of BKV viral load in the urine in patients with known BKV viruria. BKV nephropathy should be considered as a cause of renal dysfunction in severely immunosuppressed HSCT patients without any other obvious etiology.",

Routine surveillance for ADV is suggested for high-risk patients such as recipients of T-cell-depleted transplant (TCD), cord blood transplant, or haploidentical transplant or for patients with refractory GVHD [272\u2013274]. The American Society of Bone Marrow Transplant recommends serial monitoring for ADV by PCR during the first 6 months after HSCT or for the duration of severe immunosuppression and/or lymphopenia for patients at highest risk [275]. These recommendations are based on single-center experience and expert opinion but not validated in controlled trials. Ohrmalm et al. found little utility in serial monitoring of plasma ADV PCR in a cohort of 97 HSCT comprised of 64% T-cell-depleted allografts [276]. High level or rising ADV viremia has been reported to predict disseminated ADV disease and death [277\u2013280]. Rising ADV viral load in the stool has also been reported as a useful predictor of ADV disease [279]. T-cell depletion, younger age, and GVHD have been associated with invasive ADV disease [266, 277\u2013279]. Cidofovir has been used in established ADV disease and ADV viremia, yet its efficacy is based on small noncontrolled studies and case series [272\u2013274]. Brincidofovir, a novel, orally administered, broad-spectrum antiviral active against ADV, has shown promising results in case reports [277, 281, 282]. A small randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of preemptive treatment of ADV viremia with brincidofovir confirmed the antiviral activity in HCT patients however [283]. A subsequent open-label phase III study evaluated brincidofovir treatment for localized or disseminated ADV infection in adult and pediatric HSCT recipients. Virologic response was correlated with lower ADV viral load at start of treatment and earlier start of brincidofovir after ADV diagnosis. Gastrointestinal-related (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) symptoms were most common adverse events and led to treatment discontinuation especially in adult HCT.",

The most recognized and severe form of HHV-6 is posttransplant acute limbic encephalitis (PALE). Hill et al. examined a cohort of 1243 adult donor HSCT and 101 umbilical cord transplants to identify risk factors for PALE. In multivariate analyses cord blood transplant, grade II-IV GVHD and adult mismatched donor were significant. While viral loads for HHV-6 were higher in patients with PALE, values greatly overlapped. Furthermore, peak values were detected a median 1 day to 9 days form symptom onset [289]. Foscarnet, cidofovir, and ganciclovir are available antiviral agents that demonstrated in vitro activity against HHV-6, but there are no controlled trials to study these agents for HHV-6 therapy.

At our institution among 46 patients participating in a randomized trial for antifungal prophylaxis of fungal infection in neutropenic patients undergoing induction or re-induction chemotherapy, six patients underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates. BAL was tested by cytology, traditional fungal cultures, GM, and universal fungal PCR. None of the patients had positive fungal cultures or positive GM in the BAL. Fungal PCR identified Rhodotorula nogopathi and Cryptococcus saitoi in one patient each.
