However, the immune system can sometimes react inappropriately to innocuous antigens, triggering allergic reactions. The potential of microorganisms, microbial products and enzymes to induce respiratory sensitization when used as food and feed additives was investigated in this report. A short review of the state-of-the-art methods to predict allergenicity was also conducted. Our results indicate that there is currently no established model to predict the allergenicity of a molecule. Although in-silico models can be useful to predict cross-reactivity between allergens, they do not take into account phenomenons like the context of presentation of the antigen to the immune system. There is no realiable, predictive in-vitro or in-vivo model of allergenicity. Cases of occupational allergy to both fungi and bacteria have been documented, but allergic reactions to microorganisms purposedly introduced in the work environement seem to concern only a limited number of fungi. Enzymes were more a matter of concern, with 17 out of 71 enzymes investigated in this report being linked to respiratory allergies. Because these risks are well known, enzyme exposures are strictly controlled both by regulatory authorities and 1 CFP/EFSA/FEEDAP/",

The Regulation includes an Annex II, which provides the general requirements that should be satisfied by a dossier supporting an application for the use of a product as a feed additive. In particular Section III of the Annex II deals with safety of a feed containing an additive, and this is further subdivided into safety for target animals (section 3.1), for consumers of the products derived from the animals fed the additives (3.2), for users/workers exposed to the additive (3.3) , and finally for the environment (3.4) . In section 3.3, it is stressed that the allergenic potential and sensitization via the respiratory route is of concern, and should be evaluated. Annex III of that Regulation provides the specific requirements concerning specific intended additives depending on the technical nature of the feed additive. In this context, technological additives and zootechnical additives are of interest. Thus, in spite of the guidance on toxicological safety component of a feed additive dossier [1] , EFSA is instructing that enzymes and microorganism should be assumed a priori to be respiratory sensitizers unless convincing evidence to the contrary is provided.",

Finally, we conducted a survey of existing regulations on the subject in developed countries.

Exposition to the allergen triggers a cascade of responses initiated by the activation of mast cells by IgEreceptor cross-linking [2] . Basophils and activated eosinophils can also act in a similar fashion. IgE is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to fight off large multicellular parasites, like nematodes and trematodes, less vulnerable to other effector arms of the immune system (like phagocytosis or CD8 T cells) [3] . Indeed, the typical symptoms of type I hypersensitivity, like smooth muscle contraction, itching and generation of mucus, seem appropriate to dislodge such organisms. However, modern hygiene practices have considerably lessened the population's exposure to parasites in developed countries, and the focus on IgE is overwhelmingly set on its role in the pathophysiology of allergy. It is estimated that almost half the populations of North America and Europe have allergies to one or more common environmental antigens [4] .",

Certain antigens and routes of antigen presentation to the immune system are known to elicit preferably a Th2 response charaterized by the production of IgE. Most allergens are relatively small, highly soluble proteins. The typical presentation of an inhalable allergen involves a transmucosal route and very low doses (as low as 1 microgram per year for some pollen allergies) [5] . Myeloid dendritic cells are the dominant antigen-presenting cells in the respiratory mucosa, and they are known to be very efficient Th2 inducers. Exposure to low doses of antigen in general also tends to favor a Th2 response in the absence of Th1-inducing co-stimulatory signals.",

Epidemiologically, atopy is negatively associated with a history of infection with measles or hepatitis A virus, and exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children is positively correlated to the later development of asthma. The underlying idea behind this theory would be that Th1 immune response early in life might reduce the likelihood of Th2 responses later in life and vice versa. More recent versions of this theory focus on the role of Tregs as opposed to inflammatory Th1 [8] .

Unlike allergic reactions, they are linked to IgG rather than IgE production. The pathology is caused by large aggregates of IgG:antigen complexes, also known as immune complexes. These immune complexes fix complement and can bind to and activate leukocytes bearing Fc and complement receptors; these in turn cause widespread tissue injury to small blood vessels in many tissues and organs, including the skin, kidneys, and nerves. This is thought to be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (also called allergic alveolitis). Immune complexes also form in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus where, because the antigen persists, the deposition of immune complexes continues, and serious disease can result.",

Pulmonary challenge only without systemic immunity is not sufficient to elicit pulmonary symptoms [52, 53] . The intraperitoneal route is the most common way to elicit Th2 immunity, although repeated instillation in the upper airway can also be used for some antigens. Although the mouse model is the most popular in the field of allergy research, it suffers from several flaws that limitate its predictive value. The differences in induction mechanisms, together with physiological and immunological differences between mice and humans might make it more suitable for clinically-oriented studies than for allergenicity prediction.

It is worthwhile to note that in-house research at Novozymes A/S has failed to show significant differences in relative allergenicity between different enzymes. This may be due to the fact that physical properties (size, formulation) matter more than sequences and functions, but it could also be another indication of the poor predictability of the mouse model.

Splenic IL-10 production from splenocytes of OVA-immunized mice was upregulated by oral administration of L. pentosus.

Supplementation of L. reuteri during pregnancy was associated with low levels of TGF-beta2 and slightly increased levels of IL-10 in colostrum [100] . Studies in BALB/c mice argued for a role for non antigen-specific CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in attenuating the allergic airway response following oral treatment with L. reuteri [101] .

In 1996, a cross-sectional study of 178 bakery workers in the Netherlands found a positive association between positive skin prick tests to alpha-amylase and work-related respiratory symptoms [120] , establishing conclusively the strong and positive relationship between alpha-amylase allergen exposure levels in bakeries and specific sensitization in bakery workers.

Case reports: since the link between amylases and allergy is well-documented thru numerous epidemiological studies, case studies worth mentioning fall a bit outside of the classical baker's asthma. Interesting case reports on amylase include a double sensitization to lysozyme and amylase in a baker with rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma [135], a sensitization occuring from infrequent contact with the enzyme in a lab technician showing symptoms localized on her hands without nasal or respiratory effects [136] , and one case of occupational allergic contact urticaria from fungal but not bacterial alpha-amylase [137] . Two cases of IgEmediated rhinitis have also been reported in hospital and pharmaceutical workers exposed to biodiastase, a prescription drug based on alpha-amylase [138] .",

In addition to their intrinsic allergenicity, proteases have potential effects on several processes involved in allergic diseases: epithelial integrity and permeability, mast cell degranulation, cytokine release from the respiratory epithelium [181, 182] . Proteases have been shown to interact with receptors from the lining of the respiratory tract, leading to the activation of immunological pathways that can potentially trigger allergic reactions, for example via stimulating epithelial cells to release metalloproteinase 9 and open up tight junctions promoting allergen penetration into the submucosa [182] . Proteases from pollen [183] , house dust mites [184] , cockroaches [185] and fungi [186] have been shown to have these effects.",

However, cross-sectional studies have suggested a bell-shaped relationship, like in the case of cat allergens, where high exposure levels may induce tolerance [210] . A similar relationship has been observed in laboratory animal workers exposed to rat allergens, which may be due to a \"modified T helper type 2 (Th2) response\" where specific IgG4 antibodies plays a role [211] . This is heavily debated though, as a behavioral effect, i.e. \"healthy petkeeper effect\" cannot be totally excluded [212] . The general trend that IgE sensitization and IgE-mediated allergies increase with exposure levels has been substantiated by studies of exposure to enzymes used in the detergent industry [213, 214] , of exposure to natural rubber latex allergens and of exposure to flour dust as discussed below. Enzymes and natural rubber latex allergens are used as examples of highly potent allergens, where an OEL has been set for the proteolytic enzyme subtilisin. Flour dust is used as an example of how to set an OEL for a low-potent allergen.",

Thus, different proteins have different sensitization potencies. For example, sensitization to rat urinary allergens occurs in the pg/m 3 range, sensitization to fungal \u03b1-amylase in the ng/m 3 range, whereas sensitization to wheat, pig and cow proteins occurs in the \u03bcg/m 3 range [209] . That different allergens seem to have different potencies is also deduced from environmental allergen exposures as only a limited number of allergens are of major importance in the general population [205] . Thus, the number of allergy cases in a population depends both on the potency of the allergen, the presence of adjuvants and the particle size, as well as on the specific exposure levels. In the German population in 1999, the number of occupational asthma cases caused by various exposures was in the order flour>latex>food and feed [207] .",

These warnings are based on recognized hazards, i.e. when an increased incidence of allergy has been observed in an occupationally exposed population. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is caused by immune reactions of precipitating antibodies and activated immune cells. Few cases of enzyme-induced HP have been reported. On the other hand, many cases of type I allergies to enzymes have been documented. Therefore, the critical effect is considered to be the type I allergy and thus, measures preventing the type I enzyme allergy are considered also to prevent HP. Most HP reactions appear from high exposures to airborne moulds and bacteria, where growth has been promoted by wet and humid conditions. In these cases, risk management should limit the wet and humid conditions, or otherwise limit growth of microorganisms. If not possible appropriate airway protection should be used.",

Epidemiological studies: n/a Case reports: n/a Literature arguing against a possible sensitization by the agent: B. animalis reduced several immune parameters in an animal allergy model as well as in a autoimmunity model and skewed the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 in females [68]. Similarly, B. longum suppressed Th2 responses [69], increased Foxp3 regulatory cells numbers [70] and showed potential to prevent IgE-mediated immune responses [71]; all in murine models.

L. paracasei alleviated symptoms of pollinisis [83], atopic dermatitis [84], allergic rhinitis [85,86]. Investigations of the immunological mechanisms behind these effects in the mouse model pointed at induction of IL-12 production [87]; suppression of IL-4 production [88] and APC maturation [89]. L. acidophilus prevented the pollen-induced infiltration of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa, and indicated a trend for reduced nasal symptoms in children [90] and similarily improved Japanese cedar pollinosis in adults [91]. In a small clinical trial, 14 patients with various allergic diseases showed a decrease in their circulating CD34+ precursor cells after oral treatment with a mix of L. acidophilus and two other bacteria [92]. Elevated CD34+ precursor numbers is a feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Two mouse studies showed similar effects [93,94] on house dust mite and OVA sensitization respectively. However; it is worth noting that at least one study failed to confirm the role of L. acidophilus in allergy prevention [95]. L. plantarum has been shown to reduce the severity of type 1 allergic reactions both in humans [96] and mice [97,98].",

Thus, a 53-year-old woman developed HP due to washing surgical instruments as well as cleaning operating room surfaces with a subtilisin containing cleaner. She had quit smoking 10 years previously. She wore latex gloves and a mask (not specified) for protection during work[42]. A 43-year-old male developed HP due to phytase; he had been a non-smoker for 20 years. He worked in a cattle feed factory, where his job was to take samples of the cattle feed for quality control. Aerosolized phytase was added to the feed in a closed system. When taking samples, the patient did not wear airway protection. On the floor where phytase was added, the airborne No antigen specific IgE was detected in patient's serum, but the level of specific IgG was high[43]. In this case HP was due to a very high exposure to phytase. Allergy due to phytase has been reported in several studies as discussed in a recent review[44]. In the detergent industry where a substantial number of IgE mediated allergies have appeared, enzyme exposures have not been associated with HP or emphysema (c.f.[35]).",
