Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.",

The mortality rate is lower than in SARS (Zhou, Yu et al. 2020 ) but the incidence rate is significantly higher. The current COVID-19 epidemic differs in several aspects from the previous one caused by SARS, which was finally extinguished (Cossarizza, De Biasi et al. 2020 , Kucharski, Russell et al. 2020 , Kuniya 2020 , Leung 2020 , Mizumoto, Kagaya et al. 2020 , Parodi and Liu 2020 . First, COVID-19 has a higher basic reproductive number, R 0 , than SARS. Second, in contrast to SARS, causative pathogen transmission in COVID-19 starts before the end of the incubation stage of the disease. Third, unlike SARS, many (and possibly most) cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but they are accompanied by a spread of causative pathogen. These features of COVID-19 lower the optimism for the prospect that the current epidemic will be successfully controlled.",

It is evident from this analysis that the overall incidence is lower when the heterogeneity factor is incorporated in the model. A noticeable slowdown in the incidence rate, however, begins to manifest itself only when the overall incidence has reached a sufficiently high value. In this example, we are considering a rather distinct heterogeneity, whereas heterogeneity is much less expressed in the case of usual airborne infections, which have high infection risk for everybody.",

Given the relatively low overall number of infections, this marked slow-down of infection progression occurred because of the anti-epidemic measures, not because of an accumulation of collective immunity. A note should be made about the 45% surge in growth rate in Wuhan on February 13. It is related to a change in the methodology for calculating the number of cases. On that day, the cases previously considered as questionable were added to the report. Thus, the graph for Wuhan matches the prediction of our model where R 0 and the number of infections decrease because of anti-epidemic measures. A similar dynamic is seen for the rest of the world, where anti-epidemic measures were also undertaken and resulted in the growth rate decrease after March 13.",

Note that the decrease in incidence growth is almost the same for all Chinese provinces regardless of huge discrepancies in morbidity levels among the provinces. For example, by March 4 the number of recorded cases in Hubei Province reached 67,466 while the median number of cases in other 35 provinces amounted to just 245 cases.

The characteristics of COVID-19 differ markedly from SARS, which makes it hard to contain the disease spread to an affected territory unless the anti-epidemic measures are strict.2. In the absence of effective anti-epidemic measures, more than 1% of the population could get infected. Should this happen, most cases will occur during the period of several months, which will cause great problems to the treatment of patients.3. After lifting the emergency quarantine measures, the epidemic could restart because of an insufficient collective immunity level. This course of events should be seriously considered when \"reopening\" provinces and countries.",
