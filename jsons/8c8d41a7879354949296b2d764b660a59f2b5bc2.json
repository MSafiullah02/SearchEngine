            "text": "Our work started initially with the pursuit of concise access to 3. So far, several different strategies have been used to synthesize 3 and its natural analogues, which include linderone, methyl lucidone, and coruscanone A. [10, 11] The most efficient synthesis of 3 was developed by Wang and co-workers. [10] Through the strategy of rearrangement of 4-ylidenebutenolides, [11f] the synthesis of 3 has been accomplished in five steps in 45 % overall yield. Inspired by the Darzens reaction and its versatile following transformations, [12] we envisioned that the cyclopentenedione skeleton of 3 could be constructed by the Darzens reaction and a subsequent ring expansion of cyclobutenedione (Scheme 2). To our surprise, linderone (4), the precursor of 3, is directly formed after the treatment of a-bromoketone 6 [13] and dimethyl squarate (5, 1.5 equivalents with respect to 6) with strong base. This is understandable, as the in situ expansion of the four-membered ring is preferred through the release of the intense ring strain that exists in epoxide 7. The best result was obtained by using lithium hexamethyldislazide (LiHMDS) as the base. Compound 4 was formed in 62 % yield at 0.5 gram scale (based on the recovery of 23 % of the starting material). The subsequent methylation with dimethyl sulfate furnished 3 in good yield (Scheme 3). As a result, a Darzens cyclopentenedione synthesis of 3 has been developed. Starting from dimethyl squarate, the synthesis of 3 was accomplished in only two steps and 57 % overall yield. [14] With the efficient strategy to cyclopentenediones established, 3 can be easily prepared on a multigram scale. Then, we turned our attention to the syntheses of 1 and 2. Solid 3 can be slowly transformed into 1 and 2 when exposed to ambient light, which matches the report of Wang and coworkers that sunlight is sufficient to initiate the dimerization. Obviously, light irradiation provides favorable dimerization conditions. To our surprise, the presence of dioxygen can increase the yield of 1 when a metal halide lamp [15] is used. As shown in Scheme 3, 1 was obtained in 50 % yield in the presence of dioxygen. The spectroscopic data of our synthetic linderaspirone A are in complete agreement with those of the natural product. [7b] The known [2+2] cycloaddition product 8 [10] was also formed in 9 % yield. The reaction irradiated under argon afforded 1 in 38 % yield and 8 in 10 % yield. No clear signal for 2 was detected in the NMR spectra of the crude products from both reactions. We noticed that all photochemical dimerizations of 3 in Wang and co-workers' study of 1 and 2 had been carried out under inert atmosphere. There are also other studies on the photochemical dimerization of butadiene derivatives and the subsequent rearrangement. [16] However, no dioxygen effect on the photochemical process has been reported to date.",

However, 2 was always a minor product formed in the reported dimerization of 3, in which the best yield for 2 was only 20 %. [10] No formation of 2 was detected in our dioxygen-assisted photochemical dimerization approach. Because of our curiosity about a possible thermal isomerization of 1, a solution of 1 in p-xylene was heated to reflux. Surprisingly, 2 was obtained in 51 % yield (Scheme 4). The NMR spectra and single crystal X-ray crystallographic data of the synthesized bi-linderone are identical to the published data for the naturally occurring compound. [7a] The thermal isomerization of 1 has thus opened up an efficient biomimetic approach for the synthesis of 2. In light of Wang and coworkers' contribution to the biomimetic synthesis of these important targets, [10] a plausible mechanism for the formation of 2 is proposed in Scheme 4. Compound 1 is first transformed into 8 through a Cope rearrangement process. Then, 2 is generated from a subsequent radical rearrangement of 8. Notably, epi-bi-linderone (9) [10] reported from the radical rearrangement of 8 is not obtained under these conditions.",

Meanwhile, a solution of LiHMDS (1 m, 5.8 mL, 5.77 mmol) in THF (6 mL) was also cooled to \u00c078 8C. The two resulting solutions were transferred to another empty flask via cannula at the same time. The reaction mixture was maintained at \u00c078 8C for about 20 min and then quenched with HCl (36 % solution). The reaction system was quickly filtered through a short silica column and concentrated. The resulting crude product was purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (diethyl ether/petroleum ether = 1:10-1:3) to afford 4 (304.9 mg, 48 %) as a yellow crystal with the recovery of 23 % of compound 6 (115 mg).
