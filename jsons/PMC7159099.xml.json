Virus assembly begins with the formation of nucleocapsids by HBcAg, which are further enclosed by HBsAg.5 HBV virions and subviral particles are the main viral particles produced during the replication of HBV. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is another form of HBcAg, which translocates into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen for proteolytic processing and is secreted as a soluble protein.6 Although the function of HBeAg is still ambiguous. HBsAg and HBeAg are admitted important for HBV propagation and clinical diagnosis.",

            "text": "ATP1B3 (also designated as CD298), as one of three regulatory \u03b2\u2010subunits of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase, was first identified and characterized in 1998.7 Previous studies suggested that ATP1B3 was not only involved in the Na+/K+ pump activity, but also in regulation of T\u2010cell activation independent Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity.8 Interestingly, recent studies reported the involvement of \u03b2\u2010subunit of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase in some virus infections. ATP1B1 was identified as a partner of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL136 protein as well as M2 proteins of influenza A and B viruses.9, 10 ATP1B3 was found to reduce BST\u20102\u2010mediated restriction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 production in Hela cells.11 Inversely, ATP1B3 was shown to interact with the 3A protein of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and inhibit EV71 replication by enhancing the production of type\u2010I IFN.12 BST\u20102 was identified as an IFN\u2010inducible antiviral protein that blocked the release of various enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola at the plasma membrane.13, 14 It was constitutively expressed in HepG2, HeLa, H9, Jurkat, primary T lymphocytes, and macrophages, but was absent from 293T, HOS, and HT1080 cells. In 2015, Yan et al15 reported that BST\u20102 directly and selectively inhibited the secretion of HBV virions, but not subviral particles or nonenveloped capsids in hepatocyte\u2010derived cells. And Miyakawa et al16 revealed that HBs could interact with BST\u20102 via its fourth transmembrane domain thereby inhibiting its dimerization and antiviral activity. Recently, our team proved that BST\u20102 tethered the nascent HBV virions at the plasma membrane. But there seems to be no obvious relationship between BST\u20102 and HBV production, which occurs in intracellular vesicles. Recently, the interaction of ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 was identified by using the yeast two\u2010hybrid screen.11 Hence, we are interested in discovering whether ATP1B3 is involved in HBV propagation and whether there is any relationship between ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBV propagation. In the present study, we first characterized ATP1B3 as a novel host restrictor for HBV replication by nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB)/IFN\u2010\u03b1 and NF\u2010\u03baB/interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) pathway. And we proved ATP1B3\u2010induced its binding protein BST\u20102 to antagonize HBsAg but not HBeAg in HepG2 cells. Our work provided novel evidence and mechanism of ATP1B3 on viral infection.",

As shown in Figure 4A, ATP1B3 strongly upregulated IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 expression in HepG2 cells. Four antiviral ISGs, which might involve in different stages of HBV infection, ISG\u201015, ISG\u201056, OAS2, and BST\u20102 were investigated. It was shown that ATP1B3 could obviously induce OAS2 and BST\u20102, but not ISG\u201015 and ISG\u201056 expression (Figure 4B), and OAS2 might have no impact on HBV replication (data not shown). Since BST\u20102 was reported to be likely to inhibit HBV particle release,17, 30 we speculated that ATP1B3\u2010induced BST\u20102 expression could contribute to the suppression function on HBV antigen. Hence, IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced BST\u20102 expression in hepatocyte (HepG2) and nonhepatocyte (HEK293T) was investigated (Figure 4C). As it is known, BST\u20102 is a type\u2010II transmembrane protein with 180 amino acids (approximately 19 kDa). However, previous studies indicated that endogenously expressed BST\u20102 protein contained complex carbohydrate modifications and presented as a smear of multiple 20 to 30 kDa bands due to its N\u2010glycosylation.31 Compared with HEK293T cells, BST\u20102 expression was remarkably upregulated by IFN\u2010\u03b1 in HepG2 cells. And siRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 knockdown attenuated messenger RNA level of BST\u20102 in HepG2 cells (Figure 4D), which supported the conclusion that as an IFN\u2010inducible antiviral protein, endogenous BST\u20102 expression was downregulated due to the reduced IFNs production by ATP1B3 shutdown. Hence, we concluded that ATP1B3 could induce BST\u20102 via NF\u2010\u03baB/IFNs axis to promote HBV inhibition in hepatocyte.",

            "text": "Actually, our previous studies have reported that BST\u20102, working as a host defensive factor, suppressed HBV release by physically tethering nascent virions on the cell membrane and resulted in significantly reducing HBsAg expression in supernatants of BST\u20102\u2010positive cell lines.17, 30 Therefore we speculate that ATP1B3 coordinates with BST\u20102 to inhibit HBV antigen. We find ATP1B3 still inhibits HBV antigen in BST\u20102\u2010negative HEK293T cells, indicating that the restriction of ATP1B3 on HBV is BST\u20102\u2010independent (Figure 5A). Interestingly, it is found that ATP1B3 expression could increase the protein level of BST\u20102 in cells (Figure 5B). Since BST\u20102 has been identified as an ATP1B3\u2010binding protein in Hela cells,11 we surmised that ATP1B3 might enhance the stability of BST\u20102 by protein binding. Results in Figure 5C and 5D completely confirm the synergistic effect between ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBsAg restriction. These results help us to well understand the HBV restriction mechanism of ATP1B3 by activates NF\u2010\u03baB/IFNs axis. Indeed, IFNs have been demonstrated to be effective against infection caused by many viruses, such as influenza A virus,36, 37 hepatitis C virus,38 and coxsackievirus A16.25 Hence, the specificity of ATP1B3 antivirus function needs to be investigated in the future.",

For the anti\u2010HBV mechanism, ATP1B3 activates NF\u2010\u03baB/IFN\u2010\u03b1 and NF\u2010\u03baB/IL\u20106 axis to attenuate HBV propagation. Through IFN\u2010\u03b1 stimulation, ATP1B3 cooperates with ISG BST\u20102, resulting in a synergistic effect to enhance inhibitory on HBsAg but not HBeAg. In summary, our work highlights ATP1B3 as a potential therapeutic molecule in HBV infection. The role of the \u03b2\u2010subunit family of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase in virus infection is also suggested to be worthy of further investigations.",
