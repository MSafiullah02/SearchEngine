Public health focuses not on the individual but on the population as a whole, setting it apart from the traditional healthcare system. The definition of a public health system is even more complex. It is a system that includes a network of individuals and organizations working together to create the conditions for health. It is the working together that enables them to act as a system (IOM 2003). This network can include government agencies, community organizations, healthcare providers, schools, businesses, and the media. Each network member, including local health departments, has a role to promote public health that may vary by community [National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) 2008].",

Today, with the increase in globalization, addressing health issues worldwide is critical.

The public health infrastructure must be prepared to prevent illness and injury that would result from a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incident. As with emerging infectious diseases, the early detection and control of biological and chemical attacks depends upon a strong and flexible public health system at the local, state, federal, and international levels.

Part of the NRF addresses the 15 emergency support functions (ESF) under which many local, state, and federal governments organize their resources and capabilities. ESF #8 is Public Health and Medical Services, which covers most of the functions of federal, state, and local health departments as well as other healthcare partners [U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FEMA 2011b]. Some of the core actions include assessment of public health/medical needs, health surveillance, managing mass fatalities, providing public health and medical information, managing behavioral healthcare, and protecting against environmental hazards (U.S. Department of Homeland Security 2008). In an effort to create a united response among agencies and organizations, local health departments follow the National Incident Management System (NIMS). NIMS can be applied across a full spectrum of potential all hazards regardless of size, location, and capacity of the incident (U.S. DHS, FEMA 2011a).

The goal of PODs is to medicate the population as quickly and accurately as possible to prevent morbidity and mortality. In emergency preparedness, PODs, or mass prophylaxis clinics, are the primary strategy used by local health departments to distribute medical countermeasures, such as medications (vaccine or antibiotics), to the public. PODs are also used in the everyday function of local health departments such as annual flu or routine immunization clinics. They vary in size, number, and location depending upon the jurisdiction, disease, and other factors. The annual TAR guidance requests localities to collect some baseline data which includes hourly estimated throughput, numbers of PODs, types of PODs, and levels of staffing.

These could include traditional \u201cwalk-up\u201d clinics where persons arrive one by one at multiple venues or \u201cdrive-through\u201d clinics where cars drive up to receive medication. These clinics were popular during the H1N1 pandemic and often are used for annual flu or traditional vaccination clinics. The second design is a decentralized POD model, where the local health department and its partners would deliver directly to the public; this concept is referred to as the \u201cpush model\u201d (Ablah et al. 2010). For example, if a target population were school children, as during annual flu season, then PODs in the schools might be the fastest method to dispense the vaccine.

In practice, ESSENCE is an ongoing systematic collection of indicators of health status, grouped into health syndromes among a patient population. The application collects information from hospitals, healthcare providers, over-the-counter pharmaceutical sales, and school-based absenteeism reports. It applies statistical algorithms to detect unexpected changes in the data and provides the information to health officials in a web-based application [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), CDC 2011]. In particular, both exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) models and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are used in ESSENCE.",

These stations can include greeting, triage, registration and forms completion, medical screening, education, and dispensing of medication.

The primary communicators with the public are the public information officers at the state and/or local levels. They are charged with ensuring that messages address the target audience and utilize communication methods commonly used among that population. For example, during the H1N1 pandemic, some planners used bus advertisements, designed and field tested by the CDC, in specific county locations to encourage the African-American community to get vaccinated. It is important to communicate clear and concise messages to the public about who is at risk (i.e., target populations) and what preventive measures can be taken (i.e., flu vaccinations). Public information messages should be developed to inform the public that symptomatic persons should not go to a POD to receive prophylactic medication but to seek medical treatment at hospitals or other facilities or from their private physicians. During annual flu vaccine campaigns, the federal government provides public service announcements to encourage the public to get vaccinated; state and local efforts focus more on providing information on when and where to receive the vaccination (Rambhia et al. 2010).",

Results found that 97% of the study respondents returned their MedKits upon completion of the study; 75% of the respondents reported that having the MedKit in their home increased their awareness to prepare for a public health emergency and the majority, 94% or more of each cohort, acknowledged that they would like to have a MedKit in their homes (U.S. DHHS, CDC 2007).

The Montgomery County, Maryland Advanced Practice Center, and the University of Maryland have studied this possibility using personal digital assistants (PDAs), Blackberry\u00ae, and iPhone\u00ae devices. They have developed a basic patient screening for both anthrax and hepatitis A scenarios. The PDA version was field tested in 2009 during an actual drive-through clinic in Tarrant County, TX, for a hepatitis A vaccine. The results found that screeners using the PDA screening were two times faster than those using the traditional paper screening (Tarrant County, Texas Advanced Practice Center 2009). More information about this project can be found at http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/CIM/projects/clinic/.",

The residents answer a limited number of questions for up to 20 people then receive a printout of which resident should receive which drug, along with dosing instructions, if applicable. The site, pretested with 8,000 people per minute, was created in web-based software that can be modified easily by the BAMPWG. Some of the benefits in using an online screening form are that residents can go directly through an \u201cexpress\u201d route at the POD and that throughput increases at the POD by reducing the number of people who need to go to screening (Relucio and Pine 2010).",

Created in order to ease the screening process for staff and to increase throughput at the POD, it was field tested in 2008 at three exercises and used real time during the H1N1 pandemic. The health department had anticipated approximately 10% of the population would arrive at PODs with printed screening forms including answers to questions as well as identifying the medication. In testing, it was found that 11.4% utilized this process. In the future Yolo County is considering having the screening tool available in other languages and compatible with smartphones (Carey 2010). Strategies that use technology and innovation are the future. As resources are reduced, it only makes sense to utilize these strategies to improve POD functionality.",
