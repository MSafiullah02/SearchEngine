However, after more than 30 years of being an HIV nurse, I appreciate uncertainty. I also understand how a name stigmatizes populations, creates panic, and allows governments and societies to assign blame. We are hearing a great deal about Covid-19 (Co 5 corona, vi 5 virus, and D 5 disease) in the popular media. This new disease is impacting so many around the world, as well as how we work, travel, and the global economy. Although we are hearing so much about Covid-19 (the disease), we are rarely hearing anything about the SARS-CoV-2 (the official name of the virus that causes Covid-19, according to The Coronavirdiae Study Group of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses; Gorbalenya et al., 2020) .",

Hence, we are hearing much more about the disease, Covid-19, and not much about the virus, SARS-CoV-2. In time, I anticipate analysts examining the domestic and global response to this pandemic will evaluate if the use of Covid-19, in an effort to reduce global anxiety and fear associated with SARS, helped or hindered governmental responses and the initial public awareness about the emerging threat.",

It is not the flu. It is not going to miraculously go away without global and individual cooperation.

Susan Sontag's book, AIDS and Its Metaphors, keeps coming to mind as I am witnessing similarities between then and now. Both HIV and the SARS-CoV-2 are \"seen as an invasion of alien organisms\" (p. 9). The alien organism, as described by Sontag, \"inevitably comes from somewhere else\" (p. 47). Throughout history, there has been the \"German measles\", the \"French pox\", and most recently the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\"-another coronavirus. In the need to assign geographic blame, HIV was \"thought to have started in the \"dark continent,\" then spread to Haiti, then to the United States and to Europe\" (p. 51-52). Furthermore, early in the HIV epidemic, we had the \"gay plague,\" \"gay cancer,\" and \"GRID\" or Gay-Related Immune Deficiency. The early terminology of the HIV epidemic assigned blame to gay men and downplayed the already existing evidence that other individuals, not just gay men, were also at risk.",

Even the President of the United States has repeatedly used the term, \"Chinese virus,\" reinforcing the perception of an alien organism that came from somewhere else. Throughout time, the name given to a disease, especially an infectious disease, poses serious negative consequences. For example, the name of disease can \"provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples' lives and livelihoods\" (World Health Organization, 2015) . For this exact reason, the WHO, in May 2015, issued a statement outlining best practices for naming new human infectious diseases (World Health Organization, 2015) . Unfortunately, President Trump's referral to the SARS-CoV-2 as the \"Chinese virus\" is contrary to the 2015 WHO recommendations and has serious implications, including racism and xenophobia toward Asians and Asian Americans (Sandler, 2020) .",

Today, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, like the HIV epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, is a metamorphosis described as \"invading the society, and efforts to reduce mortality \u2026 are called a fight, a struggle, a war\" (Sontag, 1989, p. 10) .

Metaphorically, as Sontag (1989) wrote, \"in the older era of artisanal diagnoses, being examined produced an immediate verdict, immediate as the physician's willingness to speak. Now an examination means tests. And being tested introduces a time lapse that, given the unavoidably industrial character of competent medical testing, can stretch out for weeks: an agonizing delay for those who think they are awaiting a death sentence or an acquittal\" (p. 35). For this contemporary pandemic, we know that testing is critical in limiting the number of new infections. Interestingly, everyone wants to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, or at least that is what is being portrayed in the popular media. However, despite guidelines from CDC in 2006 that recommended HIV testing for everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 years as part of routine health care, we do not see people asking to be tested for HIV. We do not routinely see providers include HIV testing as part of the annual wellness examination. If we did, we would not see one out of seven persons living with HIV not knowing their status. Maybe a beneficial outcome of this pandemic will be an increased awareness about the valuable role of routine testing, decreasing the stigma associated with HIV testing for many key populations.",

Today, however, we are being bombarded with messages related to Covid-19 that raise \"the disease's metaphorical stature by keeping alive fears of its easy transmissibility, its imminent spread\" (Sontag, 1989, p. 64 ).
