            "text": "Nucleic acid\u2013based assays have been developed for accurate and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses with a shorter turnaround time when compared to traditional methods (Gunson et al., 2005, Heim et al., 2003, Mahony, 2008, Pabbaraju et al., 2007). Most importantly, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have recently been introduced to detect several respiratory virus types and subtypes that include newly identified viruses such as human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, human bocavirus, 2009 H1N1 virus, etc., in addition to the respiratory viruses routinely isolated in a clinical laboratory (Arens et al., 2010, Balada-Llasat et al., 2011, Brunstein and Thomas, 2006, Gharabaghi et al., 2011, Lee et al., 2007, Mahony et al., 2007, Nolte et al., 2007, Rand et al., 2011, Scheltinga et al., 2005). One of the multiplex PCR-based assays, xTAG respiratory viral panel assay (RVP-v1), was the first assay cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical testing of respiratory viruses. The performance characteristics of this assay have been reported and widely accepted for excellent detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens (Balada-Llasat et al., 2011, Gharabaghi et al., 2011, Krunic et al., 2007, Mahony et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008, Rand et al., 2011). Recently, a second generation of this assay called xTAG RVP FAST (RVP FAST) with a faster assay time was approved for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use in the USA. This IVD version detects 8 respiratory viruses but does not include human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs). As an alternate approach, the manufacturer has developed a new xTAG HPIV Analyte-Specific Reagent (HPIV-ASR) to detect all human parainfluenza virus types. HPIV-ASR can be performed in parallel with RVP FAST assay in the same 96-well plate, with same nucleic acid extracts, and tested under the same assay and analysis conditions. Here we report the performance of the research-use-only version of the RVP FAST and the HPIV-ASR assays in detecting HPIVs in respiratory specimens.",

RVP FAST and HPIV-ASR showed overall analytical sensitivities of 95.2% and 100% and specificities of 98.3% and 96.6%, respectively. The RVP FAST assay failed to detect 1 HPIV-3 positive and incorrectly typed 1 HPIV-1 positive as HPIV-3. Both of these discrepant specimens were tested by RVP-v1 and repeat tested by RVP FAST. The RVP-v1 assay detected both specimens accurately. The repeat RVP FAST testing detected HPIV-1 correctly, but failed to detect the HPIV-3\u2013positive specimen. The inability of the RVP FAST assay to detect this HPIV-3\u2013positive specimen could be attributed to the low sensitivity of this assay as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) on RVP FAST assay was 169 for HPIV-3 compared to RVP-v1 MFI of 2726 and HPIV-ASR MFI of 8644. Earlier reports also suggested lower sensitivity of 33.3% (Gadsby et al., 2010) and 42.8% (Gharabaghi et al., 2011) by RVP FAST assay in detecting HPIV-3 type. Overall, our study results demonstrated that the RVP FAST assay produced lower MFI for all HPIV-3 positives as compared to the HPIV-ASR assay with mean MFI difference of 3419.6. In contrast, Pabbaraju et al. (2011) reported a sensitivity of 100% for HPIV-3; such differences in detection rates may be explained by regional/geographical strain differences. Interestingly, the same report showed a lower sensitivity of 63.6% for HPIV-2 compared to 100% in our study. However, more HPIV-2\u2013positive samples should be analyzed to draw definitive conclusions as only 2 positive specimens were analyzed in our study. HPIV-1 was detected at the same sensitivity level of 93.3% as reported earlier (Pabbaraju et al., 2011).",

            "text": "In summary, the RVP FAST assay and the HPIV-ASR performed well in comparison to culture in detecting HPIVs with our clinical specimens. Earlier studies using the RVP FAST research-use-only version reported comparatively lower sensitivity of this assay in detecting HPIVs (Gadsby et al., 2010, Gharabaghi et al., 2011, Pabbaraju et al., 2011). However, these studies were conducted in other regional/geographical regions, and in this study we achieved slightly higher sensitivity using the HPIV-ASR assay. As HPIVs are not included in the US IVD RVP FAST assay, clinical laboratories may choose to include HPIV-ASR assay in parallel with the US IVD RVP FAST assay in the same 96-well plate. The reverse transcription\u2013PCR amplification and bead hybridization for both RVP FAST and HPIV-ASR can be performed with the same nucleic acid extract under the same reaction conditions. Reading and analyzing the assay results can also be performed at the same time by creating a multi-batch with the xPONENT software. Since separate extraction of nucleic acid is not necessary, there will not be a considerable difference in total time except for setting up of the PCR assay and preparing bead hybridization reactions. We estimate a total time/hands-on time of 5.5 h/1.75 h (extraction = 90 min/40 min; multiplex RT-PCR = 155 min/35 min; hybridization and detection = 35 min/15 min; and reading and analysis = 30 min/5 min), to process a batch size of 24\u201348 specimens. When compared with the xTAG respiratory viral panel assay (RVP-v1), the use of the RVP FAST assay will result in cost savings due to a reduced hands-on time of approximately 2 h, in addition to an improved turnaround time as a result of the shorter protocol.",
