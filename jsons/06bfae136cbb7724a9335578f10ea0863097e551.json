GTPs failing NOM have a similar mortality rate compared to GTPs managed successfully with NOM. However, it is unclear if this remains true in octogenarians (aged 80-89 years). We hypothesized that the failure rate for NOM in octogenarians would be similar to their younger geriatric cohort, patients aged 65-79 years; however risk of mortality in octogenarians who fail NOM would be higher than that of octogenarians managed successfully with NOM. The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010-2016) was queried for patients with BSI. Those undergoing splenectomy within 6 h were excluded to select for patients undergoing NOM. Patients aged 65-79 years (young GTPs) were compared to octogenarians. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the risk for failed NOM and mortality. From 43,041 BSI patients undergoing NOM, 3660 (8.5%) were aged 65-79 years and 1236 (2.9%) were octogenarians. Both groups had a similar median Injury Severity Score (ISS) (p = 0.10) and failure rate of NOM (6.6% young GTPs vs. 6.8% octogenarians p = 0.82). From those failing NOM, octogenarians had similar units of blood products transfused (p > 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (40.5% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001), compared to young GTPs. Independent risk factors for failing NOM in octogenarians included \u2265 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) (p = 0.039) within 24 h of admission. Octogenarians who failed NOM had a higher mortality rate compared to octogenarians managed successfully with NOM (40.5% vs 23.6% p = 0.001), which persisted in a multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 2.25, CI 1.37-3.70, p < 0.001). Late failure of NOM \u2265 24 h (vs. early failure) was not associated with increased risk of mortality (p = 0.88), but \u2265 1 unit of PRBC transfused had higher risk (OR 1.88, CI 1.20-2.95, p = 0.006). Compared to young GTPs with BSI, octogenarians have a similar rate of failed NOM. Octogenarians with BSI who fail NOM have over a twofold higher risk of mortality compared to those managed successfully with NOM. PRBC transfusion increases risk for mortality. Therefore, clinicians should consider failure of NOM earlier in the octogenarian population to mitigate the risk of increased mortality.",

By 2040, this number is expected to grow to 22% [1] . Medical advances have led to an increase in life expectancy and enable an active lifestyle into late adulthood, including driving at an older age [2] . As such, injury patterns in this population have shifted with trauma centers noting an increase in geriatric trauma patients (GTPs) suffering blunt trauma [3] . Additionally, octogenarians, defined as those 80-89 years old, are presenting to hospitals at increasing rates. Ukkonen et al. found that patients \u2265 80 years old account for 15% of all emergency room visits nationwide [4] . Management of octogenarians requires special considerations due to suppressed stress responses, impaired central nervous system, altered cardiovascular physiology, as well as overall increased comorbidities [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, the decreased abdominal musculature in geriatric patients may increase their risk for blunt splenic injury (BSI) [10] .",

Non-operative management (NOM) for BSI was once considered a relative contraindication in geriatric patients with failure rates reported as high as 70% [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . More recently, however, these rates have been proven to be exaggerated. Trust et al. used the National Trauma Databank to find that GTPs had slightly higher, but comparable failure rates of NOM compared to younger adults (~ 6% versus 4%). Furthermore, this study concluded that failure of NOM for BSI was not an independent risk factor for mortality in GTPs, suggesting NOM to be a safe option. This practice is further supported by the most recent Eastern Association of the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines regarding BSI where age is no longer considered a contraindication to NOM [17] .",

The adjusted risk of failure of NOM and mortality were reported with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also performed a multivariable regression analysis of octogenarians managed non-operatively for BSI, with the same covariates, to analyze the risk of mortality. All p values were two-sided, with a statistical significance level of < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).",

Our data suggest that GTPs were more likely to suffer from MCCs, but had similar rates of falls, MVCs and pedestrian accidents. Octogenarians fail at similar rates to younger GTPs, but when octogenarians fail, they have a fivefold higher risk of mortality, compared to their younger geriatric cohort. Among the octogenarian subgroup, those failing NOM are at a twofold higher risk of mortality compared to those managed successfully with NOM, even after adjusting for ISS. Furthermore, any octogenarian receiving \u2265 1 unit PRBC transfusion is at an increased risk of failing NOM. The failure rate of GTPs undergoing NOM of BSI is relatively low. In recent studies, failure rates range from 4.6% to 6% [12, 18] . These rates are significantly improved from prior studies in the early 2000s with failure rates of 11-33% [14, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Our data parallel the most recent studies demonstrating an overall low failure rate among the general geriatric population, less than 7% for patients between 65-89 years of age. In addition, we found that octogenarians have a similar rate and risk of failure of NOM of BSI compared to the younger geriatric cohort, despite higher rates of [14] . Similarly, Trust et al. concluded that no association exists between failing NOM and mortality among GTPs aged 60-89 years [18] . However, our data augment the findings of Trust et al. by illustrating a fivefold increased risk of mortality among octogenarians failing NOM. In addition, we identified other risk factors for mortality among octogenarians failing NOM: specifically, one unit or more of PRBC transfusion. This data suggests that when performing NOM for BSI in octogenarians, the managing physician should have a lower threshold for operation, as waiting to operate until a single unit of blood is transfused may be associated with increased mortality in this population.",

Furthermore, there are pertinent missing variables including the severity of splenic injury (e.g., American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade). The use of abdominal AIS is the closest representation to the degree of splenic injury and is tracked by the database; however, concomitant abdominal injuries may account for different AIS scores, thereby this measure may not accurately reflect the degree of injury to the spleen and thus may introduce bias to the study. Other missing pertinent variables include information regarding coagulopathy (i.e., use of antiplatelet or anticoagulants), anemia, and what was the actual clinical trigger for operation. Also, angioembolization intervention was only assessed for half our study population, because TQIP did not begin collecting this data until 2013. This prevented our ability to analyze our entire population for the 2010-2016 period of this study; however, our small sample size of data demonstrated increased use of angioembolization in octogenarians which merits future study. In addition, TQIP does not provide ongoing physiologic data or physical examination data (e.g., development of peritonitis). Despite these limitations, this is the first evaluation of octogenarians using a large trauma database over multiple years. We found that octogenarians with more severe injuries and higher grade BSI are at a higher risk of NOM failure and mortality compared to a generalized GTP cohort. Furthermore, our study is strengthened by its generalizability as TQIP encompasses over 800 centers.",

Furthermore, one or more units of PRBC transfused increases the risk for mortality in this octogenarian cohort and therefore octogenarians should be considered for splenectomy at a lower threshold, even prior to the need for transfusion if possible.",
