Unfortunately, many conservative states have sought to capitalize on those orders to halt abortion care. In this short paper, we argue that abortion should not fall under any state's non-essential healthcare order. Major medical organizations recognize that abortion is essential healthcare that must be provided even in a pandemic, and the law recognizes abortion as a time-sensitive constitutional right. Finally, we examine the constitutional arguments as to why enforcing these orders against abortion providers should not stand constitutional scrutiny. We conclude that no public health purpose can be served by this application because abortion uses less scarce resources and involves fewer contacts with healthcare professionals than prenatal care and delivery assistance, which is continuing to be provided in this public health emergency.",

In Iowa, the parties reached a settlement two days after the litigation commenced, with an agreement by both sides that physicians may -treat abortion the same as other procedures,\u2016 which -allows them to make a case-by-case determination for each patient\u2016 about whether abortion is essential. 58 As a result, abortion care has continued in Iowa. 59 Litigation in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee began a little later, on April 13, 2020. The following day, a judge in Arkansas entered a temporary restraining order. 60 However, on April 22, 2020, the Eighth Circuit -adopt[ed] the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit\u2016 and stayed the temporary restraining order without exception. 61 The plaintiffs are seeking a new restraining order at the district court now. 62 However, because Arkansas had only limited surgical abortions under its order, the stay did not affect the provision of medication abortion in the state. In Louisiana, the parties are in discussions to resolve the dispute, and the courts have thus far not responded to the plaintiffs' emergency request. 63 As for Tennessee, on",

For that reason, delaying elective and non-essential medical care is an appropriate response to this unprecedented crisis. However, the application of these orders to abortion care is deeply problematic. First and foremost, abortion care is essential and urgent. Defining abortion as elective or non-essential is inaccurate from a medical perspective and can have significant health repercussions if abortion is delayed or prohibited. 66 In addition to health consequences, the legal consequences are also critical. Delaying abortion care, especially surgical abortion care, until the COVID-19 crisis passes will, in effect, preclude a large proportion of women from exercising their constitutional right to a pre-viability abortion. Abortion is therefore also legally essential and timesensitive. As a result, none of the orders should be interpreted to prohibit abortion care.",

For instance, courts are quick to uphold state quarantine and vaccination orders in light of a sufficient public health crisis, even though forced quarantine undoubtedly infringes on a person's liberty interest and coerced vaccination restricts a person's right to bodily autonomy. 93 Though early courts evaluated these invasions under a reasonableness standard, upholding state conduct unless it was arbitrary or unreasonable under Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 94 the modern view is that the state's conduct would be evaluated under strict scrutiny if it involved a restriction 91 Id. 95 This is a point of contention as the Supreme Court has never re-examined the limits of state powers during a public health emergency under modern constitutional analysis, which relies on tiers of scrutiny. And the legal standard chosen could very easily determine the outcome-the reasonableness standard is a much lower bar than strict scrutiny. In fact, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits opted to use the reasonableness standard to permit Arkansas and Texas's enforcement of the non-essential healthcare orders against abortion providers. 96 It is worth noting that these historically conservative courts might walk back their reliance on the reasonableness standard in Jacobson once plaintiffs begin challenging state restrictions to other protected liberties that are more aligned with conservative values, like halting religious services. 97 But regardless, we argue below that recent state attempts to enforce non-essential healthcare orders against abortion providers should fail under any standard.",

It neither preserves PPE nor limits healthcare interactions compared to the default alternative of prenatal care and delivery, and multiple major medical organizations recommend that abortion care be considered essential and time-sensitive. 111 In fact, it might harm public health by forcing women to travel across state lines for abortion care, thus increasing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or to resort to unsafe methods for abortion. 112 Rather, the public health emergency is being used as a pretext for the states' longstanding attempt to end abortion by any means necessary. 113 Assuming this constitutional analysis is correct, it is worth briefly discussing the appropriate remedy.
