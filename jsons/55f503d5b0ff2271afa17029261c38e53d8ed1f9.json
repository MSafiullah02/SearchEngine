It accounts for 1-2% of all ambulatory visits and causes missed days from work and school [1, 2] . The cause is typically infectious in etiology, with viruses being most common pathogens involved, followed by bacteria, fungi, and rarely parasites. Noninfectious conditions may cause pharyngitis, and if symptoms are not self-limiting or do not respond to appropriate medical treatment, they should be considered. Symptoms range from a mild sore throat lasting for several days to severe manifestations that threaten the patency of the airway. Deep neck space infections can also extend directly into the mediastinum or the lungs causing life-threatening mediastinitis or pneumonia, underscoring the importance of early recognition and treatment.",

The initial approach to a patient with suspected pharyngitis or parapharyngeal space infection, however, should always include a careful assessment for signs of airway compromise. Findings of concern include respiratory distress, drooling, orthopnea, muffled speech (\"hot potato voice\"), difficulty turning the head, and elevation of the tongue and floor of the mouth. A patient in acute distress due to a retropharyngeal abscess, for example, may exhibit opisthotonic posturing with neck hyperextension. These findings should prompt immediate transfer to an emergency department for evaluation with flexible laryngoscopy, if expertise is available. In extreme cases, emergency endotracheal intubation or surgical interventions are necessary to establish and protect the airway. Intravenous broadspectrum antibiotics should also be administered as soon as possible in critical patients. The laboratory evaluation typically includes a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic), and pharyngeal, laryngeal, tracheal, or epiglottis cultures for those undergoing a procedure that protects their airway. Imaging should be deferred for the critically ill patient until their airway has been secured.

Table 5 .1 lists the more common causes of viral pharyngitis. Pharyngitis is usually one of several symptoms that patients complain about when infected with any of the common \"cold and flu\" viruses. Since respiratory viral pathogens do not discriminate between mucosal targets, symptoms of conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and laryngitis with cough and/or hoarseness are typically present along with the sore throat. If only a single mucous membrane appears to be involved, a bacterial cause should be considered. Any of the respiratory viral infections can be associated with fever, especially in young children, but influenza viruses and adenoviruses are notorious for causing fevers at any age. Viral pharyngitis is a clinical diagnosis. Respiratory virus diagnostic testing is available, however, for patients with severe infection or confusing atypical presentations. At the present, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing can be performed on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples.

For example, exudative pharyngitis is a classic finding in patients with infectious mononucleosis, a syndrome most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The syndrome is diagnosed clinically in patients with exudative pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Fevers are common and can persist for 3 weeks or longer. Patients with infectious mononucleosis also complain of extreme fatigue, sometimes lasting for months. The diagnosis of EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis is confirmed serologically by testing for IgM and IgG antibodies against the EBV viral capsid antigen (EBV VCA IgM and IgG). The detection of EBV VCA IgM is consistent with acute EBV infection. A rapid screening test for EBV infection, the serum heterophil antibody assay, is still used commonly. Results should be interpreted with caution since the assay is both less sensitive and less specific than antibody testing. Treatment for EBV infection is primarily supportive care. In severe cases, the combination of pronounced pharyngeal swelling and impressive cervical adenopathy may lead to concerns for impending airway compromise. Under such circumstance, systemic glucocorticoids can be administered to reduce the swelling, perhaps avoiding the need for a medical or surgical procedure to maintain airway patency. The use of glucocorticoids should otherwise be avoided because of their immunosuppressive activity.",

The syndrome is characterized by self-limiting fevers, malaise, myalgias, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy occurring several days to several weeks after exposure. HIV should, therefore, be suspected in all patients who present with an infectious mononucleosis syndrome. The diagnosis of HIV infection is made using combined, fourth-generation tests designed to detect both HIV-specific antibodies and HIV p24 antigen. Patients who are infected recently, who have not yet seroconverted by making anti-HIV antibodies, often have detectable circulating HIV p24 antigen. A major advantage of fourth-generation testing is the ability to detect HIV p24 antigen and diagnose HIV infection as early as 1 week after exposure.

Thrush is quite common during the first few months of life, at least in part because of the immaturity of the newborn's cellular immune function. In almost every other instance, C. albicans requires a conditional opportunity to cause an opportunistic infection. Patients who are being treated with long-term antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications, including glucocorticoids, and those with primary and acquired immune deficiencies commonly develop thrush. Untreated, the infection can progress and extend to posterior pharyngeal cavity structures, the esophagus, and the airway. Pharyngitis secondary to candidiasis can be extremely painful causing severe dysphagia. When oral candidiasis progresses to visibly involve the structures of the posterior oropharyngeal cavity, it is important to consider that it may have also spread to the esophagus, larynx, or trachea. Direct visualization using nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy may be indicated. The presence of advanced oral candidiasis in a patient without known risk factors should always prompt an evaluation for immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection.

            "text": "Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common cause of acute bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillopharyngitis. Less frequent causes are listed in . Table 5 .2. Clinically, streptococcal pharyngitis is associated with fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal erythema, and tonsillar swelling. Exudate may be seen on the posterior pharyngeal wall and on the tonsils. Streptococcal pharyngitis may also be associated with the presence of palatal petechiae and a skin rash. The diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is based on both the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory testing. The Centor and modified Centor criteria Chlamydophila psittaci Rare a Chlamydia trachomatis can be detected regularly from pharyngeal swabs, but is only rarely associated with symptoms of pharyngitis (. Table 5 .3) have been used as diagnostic adjuncts to help clinicians identify patients who are likely to have GAS infection and unlikely to have a viral infection. A score of 0 or 1 on the modified Centor score indicates a low probability of GAS infection, and no further diagnostic testing or empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended. Score of 2 or 3 indicates the possibility of strep throat, so throat cultures are recommended, with initiation of antibiotics if the cultures are positive for group A streptococcus. A score of 4 or more once indicated that empiric treatment with antibiotics should be started while waiting for culture results; however, in recent years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) and national professional societies have since recommended against empiric antibiotic usage [7 Call Out Box 5.2]. Antibiotics should only be used when cultures are positive [14, 15] . Overall, evidence has shown only a modest benefit of antibiotics in reducing the duration of a sore throat symptoms; however treatment is highly effective at preventing acute rheumatic fever and reduces the frequency of peritonsillar abscess formation [16] . Antibiotic treatment does not, however, reduce the possibility of developing post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GAS pharyngitis unless the patient is allergic to it. Amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative. Patients who are allergic to, or cannot tolerate, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics can be treated with clindamycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Unlike many other common bacterial pathogens, S. pyogenes has not developed resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to clindamycin is rare in most communities but well described in others. Occasional resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin is also seen. Clinical treatment failures with penicillin and amoxicillin do occur despite the absence of antibiotic resistance. Such failures are best explained by failure of the penicillin pharmacodynamics, not by a resistance mechanism acquired by the streptococcus. Some patients develop recurrent GAS pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis because unlike many other common infections, natural disease does not confer protective immunity to reinfection. The American Academy of Otolaryngology clinical practice guidelines for streptococcal pharyngitis advocate for watchful waiting if a patient has had fewer than seven documented episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in the last year, fewer than five episodes per year for at least 2 years, or fewer than three infections per year for at least 3 years [17, 18] . For patients who do not meet these criteria, tonsillectomy may be offered. In addition, tonsillectomy may be considered in patients with comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea, chronic tonsillitis unresponsive to medical therapy, cardiac valvular disease, recurrent febrile seizures, tonsiliths, history of peritonsillar abscess, or allergy/intolerance to antibiotic therapy. Ideally, a tonsillectomy should be performed in the absence of an active infection to reduce the chances of a surgical complication such as postoperative bleeding. Occasionally an emergency tonsillectomy, historically referred to as a quinsy tonsillectomy, needs to be performed because of airway compromise.",

Evolving changes in the antibiotic susceptibility profiles for several of these bacterial types further complicate approaches to patient management [11, 20, 21] . Differentiating between an abscess and phlegmon on clinical grounds is difficult since both conditions cause sore throat, dysphagia, otalgia, voice changes, and swelling of the neck and oropharyngeal cavity. Abscesses are usually discovered by computed tomography (CT) scan; however the level of suspicion for an abscess is raised if there is marked swelling of the oropharynx or neck or when an infection is not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Abscess formation is the result of the host reaction to an infection and serves to encapsulate the infected area. The lack of blood flow into the abscess, together with the low pH and low or absent oxygen context, can render antibiotics ineffective in treating these infections due to their inability to penetrate the abscess intact at concentrations that are bactericidal.",

This condition refers to a rapidly spreading cellulitic infection of the submental, sublingual, and submandibular areas, typically due to an infection originating in the teeth. The swelling of the sublingual space displaces the tongue superiorly and posteriorly. The swelling impairs speech and ability to swallow. As the infection progresses, the patency of the airway becomes compromised. On physical examination, the patient has a muffled voice and appears distressed. Trismus may prevent examination of the oropharynx. The structures of the superior neck are indurated with a marked elevation of the tongue and floor of mouth. Ludwig's angina is a surgical emergency. The treatment priority is establishing a protected airway, typically by tracheostomy. Once the airway is protected, the infection is incised and drained and the area debrided as necessary. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are used.

Abscesses appear as areas of hypodensity with rim enhancement. Other imaging modalities, including plain radiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be considered. Plain radiographs and ultrasonography do not provide the resolution detail that a CT scan does, but may be useful in some instances.

Ultrasonography allows for the possibility of concurrent evaluation and treatment of an abscess with drainage under guidance, although the inability of ultrasound to visualize deeper structures of the neck often limits its use.

Other complications include bacteremia, Lemierre's syndrome, carotid artery aneurysm/rupture, and spread along adjacent neck spaces or along fascial planes. Lemierre's syndrome occurs when infection, usually with the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum, extends from the pharynx or parapharyngeal space to the internal jugular vein causing an infectious thrombophlebitis. This can lead to bacteremia as portions of the infected clot break away causing septic emboli. The lungs are typically affected first. Patients with septic metastasis of infection to the lungs may develop pulmonary nodules, cavities, and abscesses. Patients may also develop septic arthritis, particularly of the knee, hip, or shoulder [32] . The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome is confirmed by performing a contrastenhanced CT scan of the neck to demonstrate the presence of a thrombosed internal jugular vein. Treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics that include reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria. Some experts also recommend anticoagulation therapy. In rare instances, ligation or excision of the internal jugular vein may be necessary if the patient fails to respond to standard treatment [7 Call Out Box 5.5].",

Unlike Lemierre's syndrome, this condition tends to affect nonvascular structures in the carotid sheath, resulting in Horner syndrome and palsies of cranial nerves IX through XII. Damage to the walls of the carotid artery may produce a pulsatile neck mass on palpation, and in the case of carotid artery rupture, an expanding neck hematoma may be accompanied by a very large volume of bright red blood coming from the oropharynx.
