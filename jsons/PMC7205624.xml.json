Furthermore, the elective operating rooms are completely locked down and general management has imposed the cancellation of all vacations for HUG employees (i.e., 11,730 of them). The neurosurgery department with its high-tech platform is maximally concerned by these institutional efforts (i.e., by the closure of its hybrid vascular operating rooms and of its intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance suite).",
