            "text": "Background: Hajj is one of the largest and the most ethnically and culturally diverse mass gatherings worldwide. The use of appropriate surveillance systems ensures timely information management for effective planning and response to infectious diseases threats during the pilgrimage. The literature describes infectious diseases prevention and control strategies for Hajj but with limited information on the operations and characteristics of the existing Hajj infectious diseases surveillance systems. Method: We reviewed documents, including guidelines and reports from the Saudi Ministry of Health's database, to describe the characteristics of the infectious diseases surveillance systems that were operational during the 2015 Hajj, highlighting best practices and gaps and proposing strategies for strengthening and improvement. Using Pubmed and Embase online search engines and a combination of search terms including, 'mass gatherings' 'Olympics' 'surveillance' 'Hajj' 'health security', we explored the existing literature and highlighted some lessons learnt from other international mass gatherings. Results: A regular indicator-based infectious disease surveillance system generates routine reports from health facilities within the Kingdom to the regional and central public health directorates all year round. During Hajj, enhanced indicator-based notifiable diseases surveillance systems complement the existing surveillance tool to ensure timely reporting of event information for appropriate action by public health officials. Conclusion: There is need to integrate the existing Hajj surveillance data management systems and to implement syndromic surveillance as an early warning system for infectious disease control during Hajj. International engagement is important to strengthen Hajj infectious diseases surveillance and to prevent disease transmission and globalization of infectious agents which could undermine global health security.",

The Saudi MoH collaborates with other organizations, such as the municipality and the ministry of Hajj to ensure food and water safety, vector control, waste management and to provide other public health services during Hajj. To that end, the MoH conducted various risks assessments in preparation for the 2015 Hajj, including an international health regulations (IHRs) public health core capacity assessment at the points of entry and disseminated the updated pre-travel advice and health requirements for pilgrims and workers involved in the Hajj. 12 The latter includes details of the vaccination requirement for meningococcal meningitis, yellow fever, seasonal influenza and polio. 12 In line with IHR 2005, pilgrims arriving from certain countries in Africa and South and Central America were required to present a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate on arrival. All pilgrims were required to present valid certificate of vaccination with quadrivalent (ACYW135) meningococcal vaccine, and those arriving from countries in the African meningitis belt, were given 500 mg of oral ciprofloxacin as chemoprophylaxis to lower meningococcal carriage rate among these pilgrims. Oral ingestion of ciprofloxacin was directly observed by healthcare workers to ensure adherence. All pilgrims travelling from polio risk countries received 1 dose of oral polio vaccine at borders points on arrival in Saudi Arabia regardless of age and vaccination status. The MoH also recommended the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to all pilgrims before arrival for Hajj, particularly pilgrims at risk of developing severe complications of seasonal influenza, including pregnant women, elderly individuals, children aged 6 months to 5 years, pilgrims with coexisting medical conditions and healthcare workers. 12 The command and control centre (CCC) is a special MoH unit created in the aftermath of the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012 to coordinate an appropriate response to infectious diseases outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. As the crisis management arm of the MoH, the CCC coordinated the outbreak response plans of the MoH during the 2015 Hajj, establishing clearly defined interfaces between various MoH departments and international organizations to ensure appropriate and timely response to outbreaks of infectious diseases. The CCC created three situation rooms at key locations in Hajj sites; the Health Directorate of Makkah Region, Almahbat Mina and the Mina Emergency Hospital. These sites were selected because pilgrims spend most of their time in Makkah and Mina, performing Hajj rituals which potentially impacts on their safety and well-being.",

Suspected cases of infectious diseases identified at primary health centres were referred to pre-specified hospitals for confirmation of diagnosis, further management and notification to the CCC. The hospital teams were reinforced by 21 fixed and 15 mobile surveillance teams from the regional directorates to ensure 24-h active surveillance during the Hajj. 15 Whereas each fixed team consisted of 1 medical doctor and 1 health inspector, each mobile team was made up of 2 medical doctors (a male and a female), 1 health inspector and 1 driver. These personnel were drawn from different regional health directorates, across the country and mobilized for a 4-day refresher course, accredited by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties. Among other relevant topics, the refresher course was focused on discussing the current trends in the management and control of infectious diseases as well as the reporting formats and tools for infectious diseases surveillance during Hajj. The fixed surveillance teams were assigned to each hospital operating in the Hajj areas and reviewed admission logbooks for cases with clinical features of infectious diseases and followed up on cases admitted into the wards to identify and report suspected cases of notifiable diseases to ensure no cases were missed by the hospital surveillance teams. The mobile surveillance teams were tasked to conduct field investigations for reported cases of infectious diseases. These included active case finding and safe transfer of suspected cases to designated facilities, contact tracing, risk communication and liaison with medical office for pilgrims (see later) to facilitate case reporting and effective follow-up of contacts of cases.",

They may set up clinics or hospitals within the Hajj areas and provide healthcare services for their own pilgrims in compliance with the Saudi MoH rules and regulations. The composition of the medical office for pilgrims varies from country to country; however, it is recommended that a minimum of 20% of their staff should have a public health background. 17 A memorandum of understanding is established between the Saudi authorities and the medical office for pilgrims for effective coordination and communication of the standard public health requirements for the Hajj. The medical offices are required to comply with the standard sanitary requirements for food preparation and handling, to educate pilgrims on personal hygiene and proper waste disposal and to submit a valid contract with an accredited firm for medical waste management to the regional directorates. Additionally, they are required to provide daily reports on notifiable diseases, to establish isolation areas for suspected cases and to coordinate with the public health supervisory teams for the safe transfer of these cases when necessary. Of the 60 country medical offices operational during the 2015 Hajj only 20 (33%) were found to be compliant with the standard requirements of the Saudi MoH. The inconsistency of some medical representatives, with regards to compliance with the requirements of the MoH and the frequent change of medical teams by countries sending pilgrims, often soon after the Hajj limits sustainable partnership between the MoH and the medical offices for pilgrims. locations. 2, 18 Overall, two electronic surveillance systems were operational during the 2015 Hajj: the health electronic surveillance network (HESN) and the electronic statistical system for Hajj referred to as CITREX. HESN is a web-based electronic solution, introduced by the Saudi MoH to improve communication among public health professionals involved in outbreak management as well as to provide quality health data for planning and effective allocation of resources. HESN was initially implemented as a pilot in Makkah region of Saudi Arabia in 2012. By January 2014, a country-wide implementation was initiated to control the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom. During the 2015 Hajj, in addition to the traditional data capture and reporting tools, the hospital surveillance teams also collated and entered infectious diseases data directly into HESN once a notification was received from the laboratory, emergency rooms, isolation wards and other departments in hospitals. The uploaded data were immediately displayed on electronic dash boards in the CCC's situation rooms. Data were analysed and reports generated in real-time that could be immediately accessed by public health officials and decision makers or disseminated through phone messages to responsible persons for immediate action. CITREX is a web-based electronic solution that predates HESN and was used in the preceding Hajj seasons. In 2015 Hajj, this system was operational alongside HESN. Unlike HESN which is implemented country-wide, CITREX is used only during Hajj to manage infectious diseases data captured inreal time from the health facilities in the Holy areas (Makkah, Medina, Arafat and Mina). Although the hospital surveillance teams handled data entry into HESN, the fixed surveillance teams captured the same health data into CITREX for analysis and notification on distinct electronic dashboards at the CCC.",

This contributed to the development of modern surveillance systems for the Hajj, evolving from the paper-based reporting tools to a more efficient web-based electronic surveillance systems. Enhanced IDSSs were introduced to complement the conventional surveillance system in addressing the increased risks of infectious diseases transmission and outbreaks during the Hajj. Existing electronic surveillance systems (HESN and CITREX) automatically generates reports and have the advantage of timeliness, as public health personnel at different locations can access and synchronize information management once data is captured at the reporting sites. However, the implication of having parallel systems capturing and interpreting the same health data has some potential implications, including duplication of work, depletion of already limited resources during Hajj and uncertainty of the accuracy of the data. Therefore, there is a need to conduct operational studies to assess the feasibility of integrating the diverse surveillance systems utilized during Hajj into one efficient tool. Prioritizing systems that remain operational for routine surveillance after Hajj may promote the most efficient use of resources. 14 Furthermore, there is need to sustain the enhanced surveillance system and other public health interventions at key locations in the Kingdom, including the points of entry, after the Hajj, as a prevention and control strategy for the international spread of diseases during other mass gatherings with international dimensions, principally the Umrah pilgrimage. It is estimated that over 8 million pilgrims arrive to the Kingdom yearly to participate in the Umrah, which occurs nearly all-year round.",

Symptomatic pilgrims who prefer 'quick-to-access' pharmacies may not present to the health facilities, eluding the current notifiable disease surveillance systems operational during Hajj. Syndromic surveillance uses aggregated data of symptom groups from a wide range of sources that precedes clinical diagnosis to set thresholds for responding to a threat. 14 This kind of surveillance is also useful for dispelling or confirming rumours of outbreaks, based on changes in the reported number of aggregated cases in an area. 11 The potential benefits of syndromic surveillance during mass gatherings were reported during previous Olympic games. For example, the syndromic surveillance system implemented during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games improved the detection and response time to potential outbreaks during the games. 20 Additionally, the daily syndromic surveillance data captured during the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympic Games reassured public health officials and political office holders of the absence of outbreaks, which substantially impacted on planning, and boosted the legacy of the event. 11 Thus, the MoH through the global centre for mass gatherings medicine (GCMGM) and the Saudi field epidemiology training programme is setting up a syndromic surveillance system for the Hajj and Umra mass gatherings to complement the enhanced IDSS, as an early warning system for public health threats. This system may become operational during the 2016 Hajj.",

Rather, it starts well before they arrive to the Kingdom and lasts long after they have returned to their home countries. Prevention of importation and exportation of infectious agents in Hajj is key for global health security and effective infectious disease surveillance both in the Kingdom during Hajj, as well as in the countries of origin of pilgrims, is crucial in achieving this.
