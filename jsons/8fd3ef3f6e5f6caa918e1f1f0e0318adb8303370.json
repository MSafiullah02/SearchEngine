The absence of mono-ubiquitin in some of our blotting assays together with the efficient cleavage of Ub-AMC (detected by a fluorescent signal) was confusing and led us to reassess diubiquitin cleavage using a SYPRO Ruby protein stain for detection. With this reagent, mono-ubiquitin product was detected on our SDS gels, as shown in multiple figures here. It is likely that inefficient di-ubiquitin cleavage by OtDUB1-311 (Supplementary Figure 1a) , combined with some of the mono-ubiquitin product passing through the PVDF membrane during transfer, prevented detection by anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting.",

            "text": "Cleavage assays using immunoblotting did help us initially identify a likely ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) within OtDUB. For this we had used a high concentration of enzyme (0.5 \u03bcM) compared to substrate (1.0 \u03bcM) to ensure we observed activity, which actually resulted in auto-inhibition and incomplete substrate cleavage, especially for K63 chains. We anticipated that the reaction products could be inhibiting OtDUB; however, when residues 1-311 were pre-incubated with mono-(shown) or di-ubiquitin (not shown), the DUB became more active, not less, and could cleave chains to near completion within 10 min (Supplementary Figure  1b) . Given that residues 1-311 contain both a DUB domain (1-170) and a putative accessory domain/VR-1 (170-311), we tested the DUB domain alone (residues 1-177) and observed increased cleavage kinetics of K48 and K63 tetra-ubiquitin chains compared to 1-311 when the enzyme was added at 500 nM (Supplementary Figure 2a) . These experiments were also carried out with OtDUB1-259, which exhibits activity comparable to or slightly better than OtDUB1-311 when tested against Ub-AMC, tetra-ubiquitin and di-ubiquitin at both 50 nM and 500 nM enzyme concentrations . Residues 260-311 were removed as they are disordered based on the APO crystal structure (Figure 1a ). From these data, we hypothesized residues 170-259 contained a UBD.",
