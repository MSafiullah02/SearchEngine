This is not surprising, given the rewards that have so far been reaped from this genomic technology, especially in understanding cancer and in the development of new practical tools for classifying cancer patients on the basis of disease outcome or predicted treatment-response. Yet, as shown in Figure 1\n, the number of published papers on DNA microarray-based host response profiling in the setting of infectious diseases still lags significantly behind the number of papers on the use of this approach in the study of cancer. There are many probable reasons for this discrepancy.",

The use of clinical samples allows the study of host\u2013pathogen interactions in a clinically and physiologically relevant setting by exploring the relationships between patterns of human transcript abundance, human physiological parameters, the natural history of the disease process, and pathogen characteristics. The resulting complexity presents challenges beyond those posed by in vitro experimental systems or small animal models. In this review, we address some of the methodological issues raised by this approach in this setting. An overview of some of the factors to consider in designing DNA microarray-based studies of infectious diseases is provided in Figure 2\n. Readers interested in a broad overview of DNA microarray technology and microbial pathogenesis are referred to two other recent reviews [2\u2022, 3].",

            "text": "In the study of naturally-occurring human disease the restricted availability of tissues and cells of various types often dictates the kinds of studies that are feasible. As reflected in the current literature, two different approaches dominate in the selection of human clinical samples. The first approach focuses on peripheral blood: peripheral blood is a relatively accessible source of human cells and RNA, and is a natural choice for analyzing host transcript-based responses in systemic infection. This approach has been used in the study of HIV infection [4, 5], sepsis [6], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7, 8], malaria [9\u2022] and febrile illness as a result of upper respiratory tract infections [10]. Most often, RNA is harvested from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or from whole blood; whole blood analysis involves less manipulation of the specimen than do most PBMC collection methods [11] and for this reason might be particularly suitable for clinical field studies. However, whole blood (which includes erythrocytes, granulocytes and platelets in addition to the PBMC) is obviously a more complex mixture of cell types, creating additional confounding variables, such as the relative abundance levels of these different cell types (see below). In addition, the large amount of haemoglobin gene transcripts present in RNA preparations from whole blood samples might interfere with microarray signals on some platforms (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/blood2_technote.pdf), although we have not found any evidence of this problem using cDNA arrays in our laboratory (J Yen, unpublished data).",

            "text": "The second approach has been to examine tissues or cells that are prominently involved in infectious disease-associated pathology: synovial fluid cells in septic knees [12], explanted hearts in cardiomyopathy as a result of Chagas disease [13], liver biopsies in hepatitis C-related fibrosis, or in response to interferon therapy for this disease [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and gastric biopsies in Helicobacter pylori infection [19, 20]. In addition, several studies have examined HIV-related dementia and encephalitis using brain tissues obtained during autopsy [21, 22, 23]. The degree to which host responses to infection are compartmentalized and distinct between different compartments remains poorly described. For example, the correlation between transcript abundance patterns in the peripheral blood and those within local cells of various types at the site of a local infection is unclear. It is not known how well peripheral blood cells might discriminate between local infections caused by different agents at different sites, or how well they might reveal basic mechanisms of local immune response. Clearly, the boundaries between local and systemic compartments are not always distinct, because there are molecular markers in the systemic circulation that can be used as indicators of local infection. For example, serum levels of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme and cardiac troponin I can be used to monitor myocardial involvement in viral myocarditis; and serum hepatic transaminase levels are used to measure the extent of hepatocellular injury in viral hepatitis. Furthermore, microbial disease agents might traffic through the peripheral blood to a greater degree than previously suspected (e.g. gastroenteritis-associated rotavirus).",

Instead, all of the microarray-based studies cited above were observational studies.

Not surprisingly, in these studies, patients with genotype 1 infection were relatively over-represented in non-responder groups. Chen et al. [17] addressed the possibility that the non-response transcriptional profile was simply a genotype 1 profile, by determining that the same set of genes distinguished responders and non-responders among those with genotype 1 infections. However, they did not evaluate their findings in an independent set of samples, and because all non-responders had genotype 1 virus, it is possible that the identified genes only are associated with treatment response in genotype 1 infection.",

However, none of the reports evaluating liver gene expression in hepatitis C indicate whether diet and time of day were recorded during sample collection, or even considered in the data analysis [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 29]. The issue is not unique to hepatic gene expression; transcript abundance profiles in blood are also known to vary according to gender, blood cell subset abundance, time of day and age [11, 30]. One approach, used in a study of H. pylori-associated patterns of expression in gastric tissue [19], is to match cases and controls on the basis of potential confounding variables \u2014 in this study, samples were matched for age and gender. A second approach is to eliminate from further analysis genes known to be significantly associated with certain clinical parameters [31\u2022]. Whereas both of these approaches if executed carefully reduce the possibility of arriving at spurious conclusions about the relationship between gene expression and an outcome of interest, they also limit the set of possible subjects from which to draw samples for analysis, and limit the possibility of discovering novel, interesting associations between gene transcript abundance and the matching variables. A third approach is to evaluate the role of the clinical parameters during analysis. Chen et al. [17] used multivariate analysis to evaluate the association of specific genes with clinical parameters, and Griffiths et al. [9\u2022] evaluated the strength of association of gene expression patterns with each clinical parameter, and identified gene subsets that were associated with each variable. This latter study also demonstrated that certain clinical parameters can help highlight for further study specific aspects of the host transcript-based response to infection, and help to elucidate biological mechanisms.",

Unlike oncological or rheumatological diseases, where the process evolves over months and years, the host response during acute infectious disease is a much more dynamic process, and can produce gene expression changes over time scales ranging from minutes to hours. Calvano et al. [25\u2022] showed that transcript responses to one dose of intravenous endotoxin occur by the second hour and resolve within 24 hours. In a previous report from our lab, Rubins et al. [35\u2022\u2022] sampled blood from monkeys with smallpox infection over multiple days and found that an interferon-associated transcript abundance response had begun by the first day or two after infection, increased during the first four days and then plateaued around day six. Other data from this study showed that transcript abundance changes can precede the development of clinical signs [35\u2022\u2022]. Taken together, these studies suggest that dense sampling over the time course of infection, beginning prior to the appearance of clinical signs, might be crucial for a complete picture of the gene expression program during acute infectious disease.",

This study demonstrated both a common transcriptional response to pathogens across cell types and studies, as well as specific responses involving Toll-like receptors and subsets of pathogens. However, the usefulness of this approach is limited by the quality and availability of the underlying data. Many transcript profiling papers simply list \u201cinduced\u201d or \u201crepressed\u201d genes, without making available the underlying raw data, or even the values of the clustered and filtered data upon which the lists were based. This type of data reporting structure does not allow for rigorous peer-review of the data, and prohibits future types of combinatorial analysis. In addition, many investigators simply create rank lists of fold changes in transcript abundance as proof for differential expression and proceed to make inferential statements and conclusions based on the highly ranked genes.

            "text": "\u2018Validation\u2019 is a term that has been used loosely in the gene expression literature. Generally, validation of results from microarray profiling of host response refers to the corroboration of changes in gene transcript levels using an independent experimental method, such as quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). There is no current consensus on the suitability or need for RT-PCR as an appropriate and/or indicated method for confirmation of microarray data [32\u2022]. Need might be, in part, based on the importance of obtaining precise quantitative data for specific transcripts in a particular study. At the same time, when a group of co-varying transcripts is found, all of which are known to be associated with the same biological system or signaling pathway, this is strong evidence that this system or pathway is affected by the process under study; independent measurements of specific transcripts might not be necessary. Some recent microarray designs incorporate extensive internal controls, further reducing the need for RT-PCR: one example is the HEEBO (human exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide) and MEEBO (mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide) arrays designed by Alizadeh et al. (http://alizadehlab.stanford.edu). As an alternative, measurement of predicted protein products might be more appropriate in some settings [19]. Rubins et al. [35\u2022\u2022] pursued leads generated by microarray experiments with measurements of interferon protein \u2014 following up on the increased abundance of known interferon-regulated gene transcripts, and with detection of apoptotic T-cells by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin\u2013dUTP nick end labelling) assays \u2014 following up on the decreased abundance of certain T-lymphocyte-associated transcripts. Obviously, validation of biological leads using in vitro models of host\u2013pathogen interaction remains far easier than validation of such findings in humans [42\u2022, 43].",

We believe that one of the most exciting prospects for this field lies in the integration of genome-wide data from multiple sources. Large-scale random shotgun sequencing efforts using samples from complex microbial communities provide an opportunity to discover and monitor the expression of genes directly from samples of these communities, whether they are host-associated or environment-associated. Community-wide patterns of gene transcript abundance and their variation with respect to time, space and perturbation will reveal fundamentally important aspects of microbial community ecology and physiology, and provide potentially useful diagnostic and prognostic information about the hosts in which communities play critical roles in health and disease. As we construct a high resolution and dynamic picture of the conversation between humans and microbes, we will not only enhance our understanding about fundamental aspects of human biology, but improve the clinical management of infectious diseases.",
