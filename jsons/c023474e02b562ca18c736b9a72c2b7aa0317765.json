Half of the HRV-positive patients died during the first month after infection, and, ultimately, 5 of 6 died.

It is also not clear from these data whether rhinovirus by itself can cause lower respiratory tract disease. It is of interest that 2 of 6 patients identified appeared to show persistent HRV infection. These patients may have had more-compromised immunity that predisposed them to polymicrobial infections and a higher risk of infectious mortality. The frequency of coinfections suggests that HRV may predispose patients to additional infections, possibly through an immunomodulatory mechanism, as has been demonstrated with RSV and parainfluenza virus [21, 28] and indicated in vitro for HRV [29] .

Strict infection-control practices-including the screening of symptomatic patients, instituting early isolation and cohorting, the universal use of gloves and masks for all contact with symptomatic patients, strict implementation of hand washing, and restricting staff and visitors with upper respiratory symptoms and children aged !12 years from visiting patients-have been in place for the past 10 years at FHCRC and may have contributed to reduced risk of nosocomial HRV infections, particularly early after transplantation. In addition, our study took place after the institution of a policy that prohibited staff with uncontrolled respiratory secretions from having patient contact, which could have further limited the spread of HRV and coronavirus. It is also possible that earlier symptoms, restricted to the URT, may have been missed. Most studies, however, have suggested a rapid progression to lower airway involvement, if it occurs.
