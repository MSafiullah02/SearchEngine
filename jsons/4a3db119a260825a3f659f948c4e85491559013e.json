The aim of the present study was to determine the pattern of airway inflammation in atopic and nonatopic children with chronic cough, and to investigate whether atopy is a predictive factor for eosinophilic inflammation in cough. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; three aliquots of 1 ml/ kg saline) was performed in the right middle lobe of 24 (11 atopic and 13 nonatopic) children with persistent cough (8 females, 16 males), mean age 4.7 years (range: 1-11). Atopy was defined as an elevated total serum IgE or a positive RAST test. Both atopic and nonatopic children with persistent cough had an increase in total cells/ml in BAL (atopic: median 39 \u00c2 10 4 , range: 20-123; nonatopic: median 22 \u00c2 10 4 , range: 17-132) compared to nonatopic controls (median 11 \u00c2 10 4 , range 9-30). The increases were mainly in neutrophils (atopic: median 17%, range 2.5-88.5%; nonatopic: median 6%, range 1.0-55.0%) compared to controls (median 1.55%, range 0.5-7.0%; atopics vs. controls, P < 0.005). There were no significant increases in eosinophils, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, or mast cells. Eosinophils were elevated in only 5/ 11 atopic and none of the nonatopic children. The increased percentage of neutrophils in the BAL fluid of atopic and nonatopic children with persistent cough could be due to an underlying inflammatory process driving the cough, or even conceivably, due to the effect of coughing itself. In this highly selected series, the absence of eosinophilic inflammation in the majority suggests that most would be predicted not to respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. This study underscores the need to be cautious about treating coughing children with inhaled corticosteroids, even in the context of a tertiary referral practice.",

            "text": "Cough is a primary defense mechanism that functions to protect the airways, clearing irritants and mucus. Cough can be classified into acute and chronic. Chronic cough can be defined as a cough persisting for at least 6 weeks 1 however this definition is arguable and others have regarded duration more than 4 weeks as chronic cough. Chronic cough is a common complaint in children, with a wide differential diagnosis. In a community setting, most children with chronic cough do not have asthma, although recent diagnostic fashion has been to assume that all chronic cough is due to asthma, and treat it with inhaled corticosteroids. Thus this common condition may frequently be overdiagnosed as asthma, 2,3 and harmful medication may be continued for a long period of time without benefit for these children. The relationship between chronic cough and asthma is controversial. Although cough variant asthma is recognized as a precursor of bronchial asthma, 4 it is not known whether chronic cough is also a precursor of asthma. 1 Atopic patients with chronic cough due to cough variant asthma are thought to have airway inflammation similar to atopic patients with asthma, whose bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contains eosinophils and mast cells. 5 In adults, eosinophils are believed to be a key effector cell in asthma. Some studies 6, 7 have provided evidence of eosinophilic inflammation in the BAL of children with asthma. Marguet et al. 8 demonstrated that the BAL profile in asthma is clearly characterized by a high proportion of eosinophils, which is independent of the severity of the disease and treatment with inhaled steroids.",

The population of coughing children is highly selected, having been deemed sufficiently severe to warrant referral and investigation in a tertiary center; none had a diagnosis of a specific chronic chest disease such as bronchiectasis prior to diagnosis. The control children were matched for age as far as possible, but since ethically we could only perform a bronchoscopy in a child in whom it was clinically indicated, this group is necessarily limited. Nonetheless, our control data are similar to those of others who were able to study larger groups. 15 In the present study, the majority of the atopic children and nearly half of the atopic children with chronic cough had an increase in the percentage of BAL neutrophils when compared to controls; but even in this selected group, eosinophilia was absent in the nonatopic coughers, and present in less than 50% even of atopic children with cough.",

Because healthy children cannot be studied for ethical reasons, pediatric BAL reference values are difficult to obtain. It is probable that the differential cytology in children is similar to that observed in healthy adults. 16 Although BAL neutrophil of 17% is the upper limit of normal reported by Middula et al. 17 (range 0-17%) and Ratjen et al. 18 (0-17%) in five other studies the median normal value for neutrophils is given as 3.5% [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Hence in our study, the median value of BAL neutrophils (17%) and the values in both the non atopic group (3.5-88.5%) and atopic group (1.5-55%) were appreciably higher than the values reported in normal children. 15 The mechanism of the neutrophilia is unclear. One of the most common causes of chronic cough in children is recurrent viral infection, 22 with some viral infections causing prolonged periods of cough. An increased percentage of BAL neutrophils may be due to an underlying inflammatory process such as occult persistent infections, caused by bacteria or viruses. 13, [23] [24] [25] In a recent cohort study published by Marchant et al., 13 a standardized pathway of investigation of chronic cough in children revealed that protracted bacterial bronchitis diagnosed by BAL was the most common diagnosis among 108 children, with significant higher neutrophil levels on BAL samples.",

However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a viral infection in these children, because molecular biology methods were not utilized and may improve viral detection, while represent the main tool for detection of some significant respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Pertussis, another potential pathogen quoted as a substantial cause of prolonged cough in school age children 26 would be an unlikely etiology once 50% of our children had cough for periods longer than 1 year (range 1-10 years). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a pertussis infection, because we did not do serology, and children who have been partial vaccinated may have prolonged dry cough without the other classical features of whooping cough. 27 It is also possible that we have underdiagnosed other infections in this group. We defined a positive culture a !10 5 colony forming units per milliliter of BALF because the bronchoscopy was performed using a laryngeal mask airway, or via a facemask with careful attention not to use suction until the bronchoscope had passed the vocal cords; the protected brush method was not utilized. The ERS task force defined this cut off for non protected BAL specimens. 15 Baker et al. 28 also recommended that the cut off level of 10 4 cfu/ml for BAL is appropriate when pneumonia is suspected and a cut off level of 10 5 cfu/ml for BAL is appropriate if the probability of disease is low. Lower cut off levels have indeed been used by some investigators 29 when a protected brush is employed (>10 3 cfu/ml) or with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (>10 4 cfu/ml). We acknowledge the difficulty of establishing a diagnostic threshold for quantitative culture on BAL for bronchitis in children 30 (as opposed to pneumonia). The second potential source of underdiagnosis is sampling error; although there are data on differences between BAL in the context of CF 31 we know of no such data on the chances of missing positive cultures in the context of bacterial bronchitis.",

We accept that it would have been more rigorous to stop this medication prior to bronchoscopy, but this was not thought to be ethical. One child had an increase in BAL eosinophils, despite being prescribed inhaled steroids, although no increase in BAL eosinophils was observed in the others. It is possible that in these children inhaled corticosteroids might have suppressed BAL eosinophils. None of the patients reported any improvement in symptoms related to inhaled steroid therapy, and indeed, all were still symptomatic at the time of bronchoscopy despite this treatment. We do not have any information on adherence to therapy. However, as a group, children with chronic cough did not exhibit asthmatic-type airway inflammation, underscoring the need for caution in the diagnosis of cough variant asthma, even in patients with severe symptoms investigated in a tertiary center.",

Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of neutrophilia in children with chronic cough. Atopy did not predict eosinophilic airway inflammation in children with chronic cough. Few of the atopic children, and none of the nonatopics with persistent cough had asthmatic-type eosinophilic airway inflammation, and thus would be predicted not to respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.",
