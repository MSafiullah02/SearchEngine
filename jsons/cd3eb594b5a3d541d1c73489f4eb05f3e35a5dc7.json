The results show that the under-reporting in the reported cases ranged from 10% to 50% in the two months of the outbreak. The estimate is quite large suggesting that many potential infected cases are in the community are not being reported. Again, using equation (3), we estimated ( ) to determine the effect of underreporting. First, we double the number of reported local cases to adjust for asymptomatic infection (12) and then use equation (3) to further adjust for under-reporting. The estimated ( ) was found to be above one for majority of the time considering a 10% reporting proportion (Fig. 3A) versus 50% reporting proportion ( Fig   3B) .

Our modelling results showed that the trajectory of Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria is far from over as the effective reproduction number is above the threshold of one and increasing. This indicates that the mitigation measures put in place have not been effective enough and efforts must be concentrated on ensuring that the existing measures are improved and additional measures that synergize the existing ones can be introduced. We estimate the basic reproduction number of Covid-19 in Nigeria is 2.63. This is similar to what was estimated for China in the early phase of the pandemic (17) . With this estimate, it is clear that the mitigation measures are not able to control the disease to the level that will flatten the curve or quash it. We further determine the fraction of symptomatic proportions reported using existing work. This clearly shows that the burden of Covid-19 in the country may be more than reported.",

            "text": "The results presented in this study should be interpreted as a guild line with the following caveats in mind. First, imported cases are not reported daily. Considering the porosity of Nigeria borders, we expect more imported cases to be coming from other neighbouring African countries by land (8, 19, 20) . Inadequate reporting may affect our estimates as we might have overestimated the burden of the pandemic because more imported cases that have not been counted probably contributed to the transmission. Under-reporting of local cases also occurs (proportion symptomatic showed that the reporting rate is between 10% and 50%.), however, this is less likely to affect our estimate, because underreporting of local cases will have a multiplier effect on both force of infection and new cases, which cancels out for the estimation of the effective reproduction number. The difference between imported and local cases explains why our estimate of effective reproduction in Figure 1A is far different from the one in Figure 3 . Second, the role of asymptomatic patients in the dynamic of Covid-19 has not been fully understood (21, 22) . There is evidence that these group of people contributes to the transmission process (12, 21, 22) . Though we included them in our compartmental model, the likelihood model does not adjust for asymptomatic patients. This may impair the estimates as what we thought as under-reporting may be many asymptomatic patients who are fueling transmission and cannot be accounted for unless widespread testing and isolate is conducted. Lastly, the serial interval used in our estimation is derived from infector and infectee data for Japanese patients (10) . This may differ in the Nigerian cohort as variability in innate immune .
