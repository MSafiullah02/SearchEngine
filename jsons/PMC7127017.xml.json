Using liquid impingers is a suitable method for sampling bioaerosols as compared with some other common methods such as filtration, which needs to separate the bioaerosols from the filter for further assays (Verreault, Moineau, & Duchaine, 2008). Furthermore, collecting bioaerosols in a liquid impinger can help avoid dehydration of biological samples, and the all-glass impinger (AGI) and SKC BioSampler are particularly designed to collect bioaerosols.",

            "text": "The virus particles such as SARS and MERS coronavirus (80\u2013200 nm) are submicron and ultrafine particles, and ultrafine bioaerosols can penetrate deeply into the pulmonary tract and may cause serious health effects (Lin et al. (2004), Graham, Donaldson, & Baric (2013)). Lindsley et al. (2012) demonstrated that influenza patients generate smaller and more aerosol particles than healthy subjects (Yang, Lee, Chen, Wu, & Yu, 2007). However, most previous studies regarding collection efficiency of liquid impingers for bioaerosols focus on the micrometer-sized bioaerosols (Tseng & Li, 2005). Up to the present time, there are only a few studies on the collection efficiencies of liquid impingers for submicron viral aerosols, and ultrafine particles (Miljevic, Modini, Bottle, & Ristovski (2009), Hogan et al. (2005), Wei, Rosario, & Montoya (2010), Spanne, Grzybowski, & Bohgard (1999)). Spanne et al. (1999) found that the collection efficiency of an AGI for particles with diameters between 0.02 and 0.7 \u00b5m was less than 20%. Wei et al. (2010) discovered that the midget impinger\u05f3s collection efficiency for particles in the range of 30\u2013100 nm was less than 20%. Hogan et al. (2005) also found that the collection efficiencies of the AGI30 sampler were surprisingly low (<10%) for sampling virus particles with sizes of 30\u2013100 nm. The SKC BioSampler, which applies the combination of impaction and centrifugal motion for collecting airborne particles (more efficient for larger particles), has also been proven to be an inefficient sampler for particles smaller than 0.3 \u00b5m (Willeke, Lin, & Grinshpun (1998), Hogan et al. (2005)). Therefore, to improve the collection efficiency of the liquid impingers for submicron viral aerosols, we can utilize the Brownian diffusional deposition of the ultrafine particles. Miljevic et al. (2009) studied the efficiency of an impinger with fritted nozzle tip for collecting ultrafine particles. They obtained a significantly high collection efficiency (~95%), primarily because of the diffusional deposition of particles in the fritted nozzle tip, particularly in the case of finer porosity frits. However, it is difficult to harvest the biological agents from the porous fritted nozzle tip. Numerous previous studies have reported the excellent removal efficiency of granular bed filtration for ultrafine particles (B\u00e9mer, Subra, Morele, Charvet, & Thomas, 2013), and thus, this technique seems to be a practical scheme for improving the collection efficiency of liquid impinger for submicron and ultrafine bioaerosols. To increase the recovery of the collected biological agents from the granular bed, the packed material used should be spherical with a smooth surface. Thus, in this study, we intended to enhance the collection efficiency of the liquid-based impinger for ultrafine particles and viral aerosols with the aid of packed glass beads. We selected the AGI30 sampler to test our approach because the configuration of this sampler is suitable for packed glass beads. The influential factors on the collection efficiency, including the volume of the sampling liquid, the depth of packed glass beads, as well as the sampling flow rate, were systematically studied. We found that the application of packed glass beads significantly improved the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler for ultrafine particles and viral aerosols. Thus, our proposal that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency of liquid impingers for ultrafine particles and bioaerosols was proven to be valid.",

A Collison-type constant output atomizer (Model 3076, TSI Inc., USA) was employed to generate droplets from the solution or suspension containing the test materials. In the Set 1 experiment, LB liquid medium (LB Broth, DifcoTM) was utilized to produce the test aerosol particles because the LB medium was employed to culture the test bioaerosols (MS2 phages). These droplets transformed to neutralized submicron particles after passing through the homemade diffusion dryer and then a Kr-85 radioactive Aerosol Neutralizer (Model 3077, TSI Inc., USA). The homemade diffusion dryer was used to dry and remove water from aerosol produced by the atomizer. In the dryer, the aerosol flows through a channel (60 cm long and 1 cm in diameter) surrounded by silica gel desiccant to remove extra wetness by diffusional capture.",

Similar to the Set 1 experimental system, the Set 2 system used MS2 phage suspension as a replacement of the LB media to produce the test aerosol particles. The MS2 phage has a diameter of around 27 nm (Strauss & Sinsheimer, 1963). Our previous study described the same procedure for the preparation of phage suspension (Yu, Lee, Lin, & Huang, 2008). Each experiment in Set 2 was also triplicate. The numbers of viable MS2 phage collected in the AGI30 sampler were determined by enumerating the plaque-forming unit (PFU) in the double-layered cultures, respectively. We used the following equation to evaluate the overall collection efficiency of the sampler for viable phages (E\nPFU):(3)EPFU=PFUs\u00d7VsPFUa\u00d7Vawhere PFU\ns (PFU/mL) is the phage titers in the sampler at sampling time t\ns; V\ns (mL) is the volume of sampling liquid; PFU\na (PFU/mL) is the phage titer in the atomizer; V\na (mL) is the volume of MS2 phage suspension in the atomizer consumed during t\ns; E\nPFU is the total amount of viable MS2 phages captured by the sampler during the sampling time t\ns divided by the total amount of MS2 phages aerosolized during t\ns. To investigate the effect of packed glass beads on the recovery of MS2 phages from the AGI30 sampler, we added the MS2 suspension (titer: 107\n PFU/mL) in the AGI30 sampler with and without packed glass beads and then took the MS2 samples from the AGI30 samplers with an auto pipette. The recovery of MS2 was evaluated based on PFU counting. Accordingly, the recoveries of MS2 from the AGI30 samplers with and without packed glass beads were 100.78\u00b113.13% and 93.96\u00b17.26%, respectively. The concentration of the aerosolized MS2 phage (C\naerosolized) in the system was evaluated as what follows:(4)Caerosolized=PFUs\u00d7VsQs\u00d7tsin which, t\ns (min) is the sampling time; PFU\ns (PFU/mL) is the MS2 phage titers in the sampler at t\ns; V\ns (mL) is the volume of sampling liquid; Q\ns (m3/min) is the sampling flow rate. We defined the ratio of the logarithm of C\naerosolized (PFU/m3) to the logarithm of the MS2 phage titer (PFU/mL) in the atomizer (PFU\na) as the atomization factor (AF), given by the following equation (Yu et al., 2008):(5)AF=log(Caerosolized)log(PFUa)\n",

MS2 phages have to propagate in the host cells cultured in the medium. The host cells can be removed easily by filtration, but it is difficult to separate MS2 phages from the medium.

A higher liquid volume resulted in more time for particles to interact with the collection liquid and produced a greater opportunity for a particle to be captured by the liquid via diffusion or impaction.

As anticipated, it took more time for the air to pass through a thicker granular bed. Thus, there was a longer contact time for more particles to be collected by either diffusion or sedimentation or impaction. Usually, increasing the depth of packed glass beads may enhance the collection efficiency of the AGI30 samplers. However, the density and viscosity of water are much higher than the air, and thus, the behavior of the liquid impinger packed with a granular bed is a little different from that of the dry granular filter media. When the depth of packed glass beads (h) in the sampler is lower than the level of sampling liquid (L), the granular bed may become unstable during sampling owing to the turbulent fluid movement. Under this condition, the granular bed could not function well, and the capture efficiency of granular bed for particles would decrease, as the case of the settings of 7h 30V\ns 4Q\ns and 7h 30V\ns 6Q\ns shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). However, increasing the depth of packed glass beads could help stabilize the granular bed and thus enhance the capture efficiency for particles. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the results of pair settings of 7\nh 30Vs 4Qs vs. 10\nh 30Vs 4Qs and 7\nh 30Vs 6Qs vs. 10\nh 30Vs 6Qs is a good example to demonstrate this effect.",

The AGI30 sampler had the highest collection efficiency when being operated at the lowest sampling flow rate of 4 lpm. When the sampling flow rate increased to 6 and 8 lpm, the collection efficiency reduced about 20%. These two collection efficiency curves for AGI30 at sampling flow rates of 6 lpm and 8 lpm crossed over at particle diameter of 40 nm. For capturing particles smaller than 40 nm, the 6-lpm sampling flow rate was better than 8-lpm. In contrast, the 8-lpm sampling flow rate was better than 6-lpm for collecting particles larger than 40 nm. This result was reasonable because small particles were captured mainly by the Brownian motion, which was presumably the primary collection mechanism at lower flow rates. Conversely, the larger particles were mainly collected by inertial impaction, which worked better at higher flow rates. A similar result has been reported by Hogan et al. (2005) in which MS2 and T3 phages were used as the test aerosol particles.",

According to the plots of the E\nStk of AGI30 samplers vs. Stk, as shown in Fig. 4(b), when the sampling flow rate was comparatively low (4 and 6 lpm), the AGI30 packed with glass beads might be an impactor-type sampler and these two curves (E\nStk vs. Stk) were identical. When the sampling flow rate increased from 6 to 8 lpm, the packed glass beads would transfer from fixed bed filter to fluidized bed filter, resulting in a decrease of the collection efficiency. Besides, the collection efficiency increased with Stk when Stk>0.07, indicating impaction was the primary mechanism under this condition.",

For the dry granular bed, increasing the granule diameter enlarges the porosity of the granular bed and reduces the contact surface area (the porosity of the packed 3-mm and 5-mm glass beads is 0.367 and 0.398 respectively). As a result, the overall capture efficiency declined with the increase of granule diameter (Golshahi et al., 2009). However, the smaller the diameter of the packed glass beads is, the higher the pressure drop of the AGI30 sampler will be. Moreover, the higher pressure drop will make the sampler difficult to operate. According to our experiment result, the 3-mm glass beads with smooth surfaces are the optimal choice for the packed bed.",

However, the best sampler should be the one that gives the highest collection efficiency with the least pressure drop. A useful criterion for comparing different samplers is the \u201csampler quality\u201d (Eq. (2)), which is initially used for assessing the filter media performance. Because increasing sampling flow rate would increase the pressure drop of the sampler, the comparison of sampler quality has to be conducted under the same sampling flow rate.\nFig. 5 (and Fig. S2) shows the sampler quality of the AGI30 samplers under different settings. The sampler setting with the highest sampler quality at the sampling flow rate of 4 and 6 lpm were \u201c10h 30V\ns 4Q\ns\u201d and \u201c10h 30V\ns 6Q\ns\u201d, respectively. The superior collection efficiency of these two settings leaded to this result, although the highest depth of packed glass beads (10 cm) created a considerable pressure drop. However, because higher sampling flow rate would result in more loss of sampling liquid (2-mL loss at 6 lpm vs. 1-mL loss at 4 lpm), the setting of \u201c10h 30V\ns 4Q\ns\u201d might be better than \u201c10h 30V\ns 6Q\ns.\u201d Thus, the best performing condition for the sampler is the setting of \u201c10h 30V\ns 4Q\ns.\u201d",

The AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads exhibited superior collection efficiency for the MS2 phages as compared with that without packed glass beads. The AGI30 sampler (without packed glass beads) has a lower but more stable collection efficiency over time. A previous study also demonstrated that AGI30 sampler had a stable collection efficiency for T3 phages (Hogan et al., 2005). However, the unstable sampling behavior of the AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads might be owing to both the improved collection efficiency (the sampling liquid\u05f3s property changed after mixing with MS2 and media aerosols) and larger sampling liquid losses (up to 5%) via evaporation concentrating the phage titer with time.",

As estimated by QRT-PCR, the mean collection efficiency of PRRSV were 0.02188, 0.01585 and 0.009333 for the SKC BioSampler (12.5 lpm), AGI30 (12.5 lpm) and AGI4 (6 lpm), respectively. Because the recovery rate of viruses with PCR method is much higher than that with culture method (Liu et al., 2012), and perhaps this may be the reason why collection efficiency reported by Hermann et al.

Furthermore, the composition of sampling liquid and spray liquid aerosolized and relative humidity can also significantly affect the collection efficiency of liquid impinge for viral aerosols (Hermann et al.
