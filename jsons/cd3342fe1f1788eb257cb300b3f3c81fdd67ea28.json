Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.",

Public awareness of dealing with highly infectious respiratory diseases plays a vital role in limiting the spread of the infection, especially in middle and low-income countries, where health systems have, at best, the moderate capacity to respond to outbreaks. In Egypt, by the beginning of April of 2020, there were over 800 confirmed cases, with more than 50 fatalities, and a rapid tendency towards increase [7] . Vaccine development is estimated to require months, and thus management of the crisis depends primarily on people's adherence to the recommended measures taken.

A little over a quarter of participants thought that the virus started as a biological weapon. This limited number is interesting since it also reflects the growing awareness of the public. A rumor about research that claims that the SARS-CoV-2 was created in laboratories has spread through social media in Egypt. The research, actually a preprint, was later withdrawn by authors over peers' criticism [20] .

Although the number is limited, we think that it has significance, since it may lead to underreporting of cases, which may cause rapid spread of the disease. The most common example of patient stigma in Egypt, even among healthcare groups, is the one associated with infection with HIV. A cross-sectional survey conducted at one of the Egyptian university hospitals showed that healthcare workers had high levels of stigma towards people living with HIV, and called for stigma reduction programs in Egyptian hospitals [22] . We believe that the social stigma associated with COVID-19 is much different from that of HIV, since the latter involves negative beliefs, feelings and attitudes towards those infected with the virus. On the contrary, the stigma of COVID-19 does not involve these negative feelings towards patients. Stigma towards COVID-19 is due to the fear of its mortality and high communicability, thus can be resolved through proper education and transparency of healthcare policies.",

The avian influenza case of Indonesia, where the country supplied the samples but didn't have free access to the developed vaccine, clearly demonstrated this problem, and showed the imbalance between developed and developing countries in this aspect [30] . Interestingly, the Egyptian government had a very successful model for drug delivery during 100 Million Healthy Lives program to eliminate hepatitis C in Egypt [31] . First, Egyptian companies got permission to formulate several generic direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C at a very affordable price through an exemption under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights [32] . Second, the successful treatment program was under the umbrella of the government, which controlled the process of treatment and distribution of the drugs [31] . Finally, the program also included screening for diabetes, hypertension, as well as obesity. So, the Egyptian government now has a database of vulnerable groups among about 50 million adult Egyptian [31, 32] . This database can be very useful if a new vaccine or treatment is approved for COVID-19.",

This knowledge is mainly acquired through social media platforms and the internet, which has pros and cons. However, knowledge was lower among older, rural, less educated, and lower income groups. This may necessitate more efforts or using different tools to communicate with these groups. Although the government has taken major steps to limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to support the most affected groups from the economic sequel of the disease. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved for the disease, we recommend that it should be available for developing countries for affordable prices and government control over the use of the vaccine and/or treatment to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.",
