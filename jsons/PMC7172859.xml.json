            "text": "The spread of infectious viruses between host cells is important for viral replication, virulence, and pathogenesis (Flint et al., 2009). Two routes exist for viral spread: cell-free spread, which involves infection of new cells through extracellular virions or vesicles containing infectious materials released by infected cells, and cell-to-cell spread, which involves viral particle transmission between cells via cell-to-cell contacts or direct connections (Mothes et al., 2010; Sattentau, 2008). Cell-free spread is well established and important for distant viral dissemination, such as transmission between hosts and tissue-to-tissue spread within the host body through blood, lymph and cerebrospinal fluid. During distant spread, viruses must be released from host cells. However, once released into the extracellular environment, viruses are exposed to several barriers that block their subsequent cell-free spread, including biophysical barriers such as mucous membranes, cell intrinsic barriers associated with host immunosurveillance, and kinetic barriers due to the processes of random fluid-phase diffusion, attachment of a virus to the host cell membrane and the penetration of viruses bound to host cells. To achieve success in distant dissemination, all of these barriers must be overcome by viruses. Considering these disadvantages of cell-free spread, many viruses have evolved to exploit cell-to-cell spread as an alternative strategy to overcome the above barriers. Cell-to-cell spread has been proven to be important for infection with many clinically important viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, measles virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and rabies virus (Christian et al., 1971; Ritzenthaler, 2011; Sattentau, 2008, 2011; Wheeler, 1960).",

            "text": "For alphaherpesviruses, the main route of spread in tissues is cell-to-cell spread during primary infections in mucocutaneous tissue, establishment of latent infection in sensory neurons, and reactivation from latency, during which the virus spreads intercellularly between the mucocutaneous tissue and sensory neurons (Abaitua et al., 2013; Arvin et al., 2007). The cell-to-cell spread inhibitory activity of infection-elicited neutralizing antibodies has been found to be extremely limited in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- and HSV-2-infected subjects (Criscuolo et al., 2019). Avian gallid alpha herpesvirus 1 (ILTV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which continues to cause great economic losses in the poultry industry (Ou and Giambrone, 2012) despite successful protection by vaccination (Coppo et al., 2013). Similar to other alphaherpesviruses, ILTV establishes latency in the nervous system after acute infection of the upper respiratory tract and cannot be cleared from the host by any currently available therapeutic treatment; therefore, reactivation of ILTV from latent infection frequently occurs once the host is under stress or host immunity is compromised (Hughes et al., 1989, 1991; Ou and Giambrone, 2012). Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for cell-to-cell spread can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control virus reactivation and the design of effective vaccines to combat ILTV.",

            "text": "Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) was originally isolated from a chicken sarcoma and was thought to contribute to oncogenesis (Vogt, 1971). Src has been shown to be an important factor for a wide range of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, adhesion, division, and death, angiogenesis, and organization of the cytoskeleton. Src has also been reported to be involved in infections with a wide range of viruses, including polyoma virus, dengue, HIV-1, coronaviruses, influenza virus, and herpesvirus (Bolen et al., 1984; Burkard et al., 2015; Cheshenko et al., 2005; Gaur et al., 2012; Krishnan et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2016; McCarthy et al., 2016), suggesting that Src may be a new potential target for antiviral therapeutic agents and may have potential for repurposing existing FDA-approved Src inhibitors. However, no clinical applications of antiviral Src-targeting agents have been reported, which may be at least partially due to the complicated roles of Src in its regulation of the multiple biological processes in which it is involved. The biological effects of Src are complex and sometimes controversial. For example, some studies suggest that Src is essential in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (Barone and Courtneidge, 1995; Twamley-Stein et al., 1993); however, other studies of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis indicate that Src is not absolutely required and even plays the opposite role (DeMali and Kazlauskas, 1998; Rosenkranz et al., 2000). In addition, Src is considered both a survival factor and a death factor depending on specific cellular conditions (Fan et al., 2007, 2013, 2014; Iqbal Hossain et al., 2015). Our previous study identified Src as the key host determinant of ILTV infection (Li et al., 2015). We found that activation of host Src upon ILTV infection raises the threshold of host cells for ILTV infection-induced cell death, thus maintaining the survival of infected cells and ensuring a high level of viral replication. However, therapies targeting Src not only repress viral replication but also exacerbate the pathological effects of ILTV and even increase the likelihood of death of the host. Because the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been sufficiently investigated, the development of Src-based therapeutics is limited.",

            "text": "Viral replication requires host cellular metabolism. While similarities exist, virus-specific metabolic requirements by different viruses have been identified. Many viruses have been shown to induce fatty acid synthesis in host cells, which provides a stable carbon source and sufficient energy for viral replication, viral spread and even the prolonged survival of infected cells (Rodr\u00edguez-S\u00e1nchez and Munger, 2019; Sanchez and Lagunoff, 2015; Sanchez et al., 2017). Although the mechanism remains unclear for ILTV, the utilization of host fatty acid metabolism has been found to be important for both latent and lytic infections with human gamma herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and the survival of infected cells (Delgado et al., 2012; Sanchez et al., 2017). Thus, a better understanding of the involvement of fatty acid metabolism in viral infection may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific cellular metabolic processes. In the present study, we observed accelerated cell-to-cell spread of ILTV with Src inhibition in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the cytopathic effect (CPE) of ILTV. Given the importance of cell-to-cell spread during ILTV infection as evidenced by the efficient protection against ILTV infection provided to a host by cell-mediated immunity rather than humoural immunity (Coppo et al., 2013), the mechanism that we revealed may be valuable for the future development of more rational anti-ILTV vaccination.",

With this EGFP strain, we investigated the effect of Src repression on the transmission of ILTV in leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. We first performed Src depletion using pooled siRNAs targeting different sequences of Src. Src depletion was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 1\nA). Upon ILTV infection, an EGFP signal was observed in approximately 10% of cells at 24 h post infection (hpi), which met the expected proportion at an MOI of 0.1 and was increased significantly by Src depletion as proven by the detection of EGFP-positive cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 1B). A similar conclusion was obtained using an antibody specifically targeting the gI protein of ILTV as assayed by FACS (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the proportion of EGFP-positive cells can be used to reflect ILTV spread in our model. Consistent with these findings, identical results were obtained for cells with repression of Src activity by one of two widely used Src inhibitors, PP1 or PP2, both of which repressed Src transcription and Src phosphorylation at Y416 in LMH cells (Fig. 1D and E) as assayed by FACS (Fig. 1F and G).

Consistent with our previous findings that Src is important for ILTV to maintain a high level of viral production (Li et al., 2015), the final production of viruses was significantly reduced by both Src inhibitors as assayed at 5 days post infection (dpi) for cells treated with PP1 or PP2 and at 6 dpi for cells treated with DMSO when all infected cells were dead (corresponding time points are indicated by \u201cEnd\u201d in Fig. 2A and B). However, neither method revealed any difference in viral titres between cells in the absence or presence of Src inhibitors within three dpi, and during this period, the viral genome copies continued to increase in all infected groups. The existence of virions was even undetectable at 1 dpi (Fig. 2B). The similar levels of viral replication within 3 dpi demonstrated that the accelerated viral spread by Src inhibition that we observed at 24 hpi is independent of viral replication.",

            "text": "Next, a detailed investigation of ILTV dissemination was carried out by monitoring the spread of EGFP using time-lapse microscopy. ILTV-EGFP-infected cells (used as donor cells) and uninfected cells (used as target cells) were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:50 in the absence or presence of a Src inhibitor. As shown by time-lapse microscopy, EGFP signals appeared between 3 and 6 hpi in all ILTV-infected groups. The transmission of the EGFP signal first occurred in cells treated with the Src inhibitor after 12 hpi but was rarely observed in cells in the absence of Src inhibition throughout the observation period (Fig. 3\nA). Interestingly, the EGFP signal mainly spread from infected cells to adjacent uninfected cells rather than uninfected cells without direct contact with infected cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the distant transmission by extracellular ILTV particles or extracellular vesicles did not contribute to the enhanced ILTV spread that we observed. To address this hypothesis, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ILTV glycoprotein I produced in our lab (Li et al., 2015) was utilized as a neutralizing antibody to block virions released into culture medium by infected cells. The neutralization of extracellular virions by the antibody was verified by the observation of EGFP-positive cells (Fig. 3B). However, the promotion of ILTV spread by Src inhibition was not compromised by the addition of this neutralizing antibody as assayed by FACS (Fig. 3C). This hypothesis was further confirmed by the fact that neither the amount nor the infectivity of extracellular vesicles (including both exosomes and microvesicles) secreted into culture medium was affected by Src inhibition in the presence of the neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3D). Taken together, the above findings suggest that Src inhibition promotes ILTV spread mainly in a cell-to-cell manner.",

Given that the initial infection was the same for all groups in our studies, we next addressed whether the accelerated ILTV transmission by Src inhibition was due to the proliferation of infected cells. To answer this question, ILTV-EGFP infected cells (used as donor cells) and uninfected cells labelled with Dil (used as target cells) were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:50 in the absence or presence of a Src inhibitor upon the addition of neutralizing antibodies, as indicated in Fig. 3E (left panel). Src inhibition by either inhibitor significantly increased the proportion of cells that were positive for both EGFP and Dil and the proportion of cells that were positive for EGFP but negative for Dil (Fig. 3E, right panel) as assayed by FACS, suggesting that both the proliferation of infected cells and the cell-to-cell spread of viruses contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV by Src inhibition in our system. Src inhibition most likely promoted ILTV spread via the latter mechanism since the proportion of EGFP/Dil double-positive cells was approximately nine-times that of cells positive for EGFP only. Taken together, the above findings suggest that Src inhibition promotes ILTV transmission mainly in a cell-to-cell manner.",

To determine the pathway by which Src inhibition promotes cell-to-cell spread of ILTV, the dissemination of Calcein AM, a dye that is soluble in cytoplasm and can freely pass through cytosol-to-cytosol connections, was assayed. ILTV-infected or uninfected cells stained with Calcein AM were used as donors, and cells labelled with Dil were used as targets. Given that the proportion of cells positive for both Calcein and Dil detected by FACS was too low to be analysed at ratio of 1:50 (lower than 1% in all groups), donors and targets were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:4 in the presence of a Src inhibitor or DMSO as indicated (Fig. 4\nA). As assayed by FACS, direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections occurred naturally between uninfected cells and were significantly promoted by ILTV infection (Fig. 4B). However, these connections were not affected by Src activity. Together with the low frequency at a ratio of 1:50, this finding excluded the possibility of the involvement of direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections in the enhanced intercellular spread of ILTV by Src inhibition.",

Both inhibitors did not affect the replication of viral DNA but significantly repressed virion production (p < 0.05) as assayed by ILTV-specific qPCR (Fig. 7B) and plague formation assays (Fig. 7C), suggesting that fatty acid metabolism is not required for viral genome replication but is essential for virion production. Considering the potential influence of the effects of TOFA and C75 on ILTV replication, neutralizing antibodies were added while investigating the role of fatty acid metabolism in the promotion of viral spread and cell death by Src repression via FACS (Fig. 7D and E). Both TOFA and C75 compromised the promoting effect of Src inhibition on viral spread (Fig. D). The inhibitory effects of TOFA and C75 on virion production and viral cell-to-cell spread in LMH cells upon Src inhibition were rescued by the addition of PAL (Fig. C and D). The enhanced death of infected cells by Src inhibition was also reduced by TOFA and C75 (Fig. E). No significant effect on cell death was observed in cells treated with only PP1, PP2, TOFA, or C75 (Fig. E), suggesting that these chemicals are not cytotoxic to LMH cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that fatty acid metabolism is essential for the regulation of the cell-to-cell spread and cytopathogenicity of ILTV by Src.",

Currently, no antiviral drug targeting the latent infection of alphaherpesvirus is available, which can lead to outbreaks when the host is under stress or the host's immune system is compromised. During both the establishment of latent infection in sensory neurons and reactivation from latency, the virus spreads intercellularly between the mucocutaneous tissue and sensory neurons (Arvin et al., 2007; Abaitua et al., 2013). Thus, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms modulating the cell-to-cell spread of alphaherpesviruses may provide promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and for refining the rational design of effective vaccines to combat alphaherpesviruses. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise intercellular dissemination mechanisms remain largely unclear. ILTV shares common characteristics with other alphaherpesviruses, including its resistance to host humoural immune responses (Coppo et al., 2013), indicating the importance of intercellular virus spread during ILTV infection. Our previous studies identified Src as a key host determinant of ILTV infection. In the present study, we found that Src acts as the key orchestrator between ILTV and its host during infection through its control of viral cell-to-cell transmission and subsequent cell death in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner. Our findings not only provide new insights regarding the mechanisms by which host Src regulates ILTV infection but may also help further reveal the mechanism of the cell-to-cell spread of other alphaherpesviruses.",

            "text": "Numerous efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the intercellular spread of viruses. The simplest and most widely used model of cell-to-cell spread is plaque formation in cell cultures with or without the addition of a neutralizing antibody, which reflects the cumulative processes of the host-virus interaction, including viral binding, penetration and replication, reorganization of cell-to-cell junctions, viral intercellular transport, and restriction mechanisms used by the host to resist infection, such as antiviral immune responses and factors (Dingwell et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 2001; Mettenleiter et al., 2009). Such models have been frequently used to investigate the processes of cell-to-cell spread and the essential viral and host factors for these processes (Farnsworth and Johnson, 2006; Krummenacher et al., 2003; Sourvinos and Everett, 2002). Recent studies utilizing advanced techniques and equipment to visualize viral infections in living cells, such as time-lapse microscopy, have revealed some novel features of viral cell-to-cell spread that had previously been unexpected and unrecognized. For instance, many viruses have been observed to spread faster than the limits imposed by their replication kinetics. For poxviruses, through the repulsion of superinfecting virions by infected cells mediated by viral proteins A33, A36, A56, K2, and B5, the speed of viral spread is four-times faster than that expected according to their replication kinetics (Doceul et al., 2010, 2012). Rapid viral cell-to-cell spread has also been observed for HIV and herpesviruses, and paracrine-dependent migration of uninfected cells to the site of infection (Abaitua et al., 2013; Igakura et al., 2003; Jolly and Sattentau, 2004) as well as intercellular spread via nanotubes (Eugenin et al., 2009) were thought to contribute to this phenomenon. Cytoplasmic connections can promote the spread of viruses such as HIV-1 and herpesviruses by transporting viral genomes, viral capsids or vesicles containing viral particles between adjacent cells (Digel et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2014; Lucas, 2006). The present study suggests that despite being enhanced by ILTV infection, direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections do not contribute to the promoted intercellular spread of ILTV by Src inhibition (Fig. 4). In addition, herpesviruses can travel from infected cells to neighbouring cells via budding at the basolateral intercellular junction or by crossing the tight junctions between cells (Cocchi et al., 2000; Dingwell et al., 1994; York and Johnson, 1993). Whether these mechanisms are responsible for the accelerated spread of ILTV that we observed remains unclear. Further studies utilizing transmission electron microscopy are needed to investigate the exact mechanism of the enhanced cell-to-cell spread of ILTV by Src inhibition.",

            "text": "Our previous and present studies suggest that Src plays a very complex role during ILTV infection. On one hand, Src activation raises the threshold of infected host cells for infection-induced host cell death, which prolongs the duration of ILTV replication in each infected cell and allows the infiltrated virus to achieve optimal replication. Meanwhile, along with Src activation, ILTV infection also tends to accelerate viral cell-to-cell spread. Unexpectedly, according to the findings of the present study, this process is restricted by the activation of host Src triggered by the ILTV infection itself. In sum, Src activation by ILTV not only ensures the ultimate replication of viruses in infected cells but also limits viral dissemination. Why does ILTV activate host Src to achieve these opposite functions? As we showed in previous studies, Src inhibition not only represses ILTV replication but also reduces the threshold of infected cells for ILTV-triggered cell death and pathologic damage (Li et al., 2015). Considering the rapid establishment of latent infection during the initial infection with ILTV, the opposite effects of Src activation by ILTV infection most likely reflect a strategy that evolves during the co-evolution of ILTV and its host, which establishes a balance for the pathogen-host interaction.",

            "text": "Host metabolic requirements for maximal viral production have been examined in several human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and KSHV (Delgado et al., 2012; Munger et al., 2006, 2008; Sanchez et al., 2017; Vastag et al., 2011), and the results suggest that inhibition of specific cellular metabolic pathways can both eliminate latently infected cells and block lytic replication, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for herpesviruses. Although similarities exist, significant differences in the utilization of host metabolic resources by these herpesviruses have been reported. For example, HCMV increased the levels of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites fuelling fatty acid synthesis, while HSV-1 increased the level of flux to the TCA cycle to drive pyrimidine synthesis. The metabolic signature of ILTV has not yet been addressed. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that Src inhibition promotes intercellular ILTV spread in a host cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Src is a myristoylated protein and can be found both within and outside of lipid rafts, as well as within endosomes, before translocating to the plasma membrane (Seong et al., 2009). Src can be activated by exogenous saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate and myristic acid, or the overexpression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36, also named fatty acid translocase), which is known to facilitate long-chain fatty acid uptake through the myristoylation of Src, leading to activation of its downstream signalling, such as JNK signalling (Holzer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017, 2019; Park et al., 2016). Nonetheless, given the increased fatty acid oxidation observed in mice with knockout of Fyn, another Src kinase family member (Bastie et al., 2007), Src activation by ILTV infection may limit viral intercellular spread by balancing host fatty acid metabolism, which can be negated by Src inhibition, resulting in accelerated viral spread and an exacerbated CPE of infection as observed in our model. This hypothesis is partially supported by our findings that inhibition of Src rescues the reduced transcription of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 6, Table S2), and that the promoting effects of Src inhibition on both intercellular viral spread and the cytopathogenicity of ILTV can be significantly attenuated by modulation of host fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 7). To exclude the potential off-target effect of Src inhibitor, two inhibitors were employed in our studies, and conclusion was made only when similar results were obtained using both inhibitors. The generation of LMH cell line and chicken embryo with Src knockout background using CRISPR/Cas9 system will be greatly helpful to further investigations of Src-mediated mechanisms in ILTV infection by excluding any cell type or chemical specific effect.",

            "text": "Considering the heterogeneous environment and the difficulty associated with controlling and monitoring the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in vivo, in vitro studies were carried out to investigate the effect of Src on ILTV spread. Although primary cells isolated from chicken embryos can better mimic the in vivo process of ILTV infection, the instability of the biological characteristics of different isolates and the short lifespan of primary cells during in vitro culture limit their use in cellular and molecular mechanistic studies. LMH is the only cell line susceptible to ILTV infection in vitro. Our previous studies found that this cell line infected with ILTV can sufficiently mimic ILTV in ovo infection, and all Src-mediated mechanisms that we identified in LMH cells were validated in ovo, suggesting that LMH cells infected with ILTV are reliable in vitro models for studying ILTV infection (Li et al., 2015, 2018). In addition, we also analysed the only publicly available, genome-wide gene expression data of primary lung cells isolated from chicken embryos infected with a different virulent ILTV strain (Lee et al., 2010), which again revealed that host Src is the central regulator of the molecular network induced by ILTV infection in host cells (Li et al., 2015). All these results support the notion that the mechanism that we identified in LMH cells is universal in normal cells and tissues rather than a cell line-specific event. Thus, the LMH cell line was selected for the mechanistic study of Src regulation of ILTV infection in the present research. Further investigations using primary cultures of tissue samples or cells isolated from the mucosal epithelium of tracheal and conjunctival specimens infected with multiple ILTV strains are needed to determine the universality of the regulatory mechanism of Src on ILTV spread that we revealed in the present study.",

            "text": "ILTV causes an economically important chicken disease. Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines since the mid-twentieth century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis outbreaks due to ILTV occur annually worldwide, and there is no cure for it. Similar to other alphaherpesviruses, ILTV establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglia after acute infection of the upper respiratory tract, and reactivation of viruses from latent infection occurs frequently once host immunity is compromised. No drug or efficient treatment targeting ILTV latent infection is currently available. We previously identified Src as a key host determinate of ILTV infection. However, therapies targeting Src not only repress viral replication but also exacerbate the pathological effects of ILTV. The underlying mechanisms of the side effects remain unknown. Our present study suggests that host Src controls the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the CPE of ILTV. Given the importance of cell-to-cell spread during ILTV infection, our findings not only provide new insights regarding the mechanisms of ILTV infection but may also be valuable for the future development of novel therapeutic strategies and for refining the rational design of effective vaccines.",
