Macrodomains are a conserved protein fold found from archaea to higher eukaryotes and are characterized by their binding to the small molecule ADP-ribose and its derivatives [4] . The viral macrodomain is part of the nonstructural protein in a subset of positive-strand RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus [5, 6] . We identified and mutated residues in nsP3 critical for mono(ADP-ribosyl) binding and hydrolase (MAR hydrolase) activity, and using mutants with decreased MAR hydrolase activity, we demonstrated that reduction of this activity impairs viral replication in cultured mammalian and mosquito cells and virulence in neonatal mice [7] .",

The approach involves the construction of an infectious cDNA clone by incorporating a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a plasmid vector. With incorporation of the bacteriophage T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase promoters, the cDNA can be in vitro transcribed to produce full-length viral RNA transcripts. Transfection of the transcribed RNA into permissive cells results in production of infectious virus. To understand a loss or gain of gene function, variants or mutants are made in the infectious cDNA clone to produce mutant viruses in the same virus background for analysis.",

The 181/25 virus was derived from the Southeast Asian strain AF15561 by 18 plaque-toplaque passages in MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts [18] . The infectious clone of 181/25 was prepared by employing site-directed mutagenesis to introduce five non-synonymous mutations into the parent clone 15,561 [10] . The parent clone 15,561 in a modified pSinRep5 plasmid was engineered to possess a SP6 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5\u2032 terminus and a poly(A) tail, followed by a NotI restriction site at the 3'terminus [15] (Fig. 1) . Because 181/25 is a vaccine strain, we reversed the attenuating mutations I12T and R82G [15] in the E2 glycoprotein to generate a recombinant CHIKV strain (181/25 E2 I12T/R82G ) that is virulent for newborn mice.",

The CHIKV mutant viruses in the virulent background 181/25 E2 I12TR82G must be handled in the Biosafety level three facility and the animal experiments in the ABSL3 facility according to US regulations. All experiments with the biological samples after infection with CHIKV in the virulent background 181/25 E2 I12TR82G must be handled in the BSL3 facility. 3. The mice should be bred under barrier conditions with a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. 4. Timed pregnant CD-1 female mice are maintained in an ABSL3 facility, and the CHIKV infection experiments are conducted in 2-day old neonates. 5. The route of administration is intracranial in a 10 \u03bcL volume having 1000 PFU of virus diluted in PBS. Prepare the virus dilution for one experiment (if it involves more animals for same virus) in one tube to ensure homogeneity, and keep on ice until use to prevent thermal inactivation. The same mutant virus is administered to all pups of a litter. 6. Anesthetize each pup prior to infection using isoflurane (see Note 16).",

The desired mutation should be in the middle of the primer with ~10-15 bases of correct sequence on both sides. Adapted from quick change sitedirected manual [https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/200523.pdf]. 5. Glycerol stock for the positive clones can be prepared and stored. But it is advisable to retransform the plasmid DNA and grow a bacterial culture from freshly grown culture to obtain a higher yield of plasmid DNA.6. For sequencing the macrodomain region of CHIKV, CHK nsp3 MDR primer 5\u2032-GGTACCCTCGAGTCATTAGG TCCGCATCTGTATGGCCTC -3\u2032 was used. For sequencing the larger plasmid, at least 100 ng/\u03bcL is required. The sequencing primer anneals to the positive strand of the virus.7. The restriction digestion enzyme for linearizing the plasmid is chosen depending on the restriction site engineered into the cDNA clone. For the 181/25 cDNA clone, Not I site is included at the 3'terminus (seeFig. 1).8. For purification of the plasmid DNA, commercial PCR purification kits can be used. But for larger plasmids, the final yield will be much less for most of the kits, and therefore, the phenol-chloroform extraction followed by alcohol precipitation is advisable. However, the purity of the DNA must be ensured by finding A 260 /A 230 ratio which should be greater than 1.8. Lower A 260 /A 230 values indicate contamination from solvents (e.g., phenol).9. Purification with the lithium chloride precipitation solution provided in the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit will also yield the same quantity of RNA. Refer to mMESSAGE mMA-CHINE manual for further standardization [http://kirschner. med.harvard.edu/files/protocols/Ambion_mMessagemMachine.pdf].",
