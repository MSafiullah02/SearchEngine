During probing and feeding, aphids secrete two types of saliva: gelling saliva, which solidifies into a tube-like sheath to protect the stylet from mechanical damage and chemical attack, and watery saliva, which is secreted into plant cells, intercellular spaces and phloem8\u201310. The feeding process of aphids is similar to the infection process of plant pathogens, with an interplay between aphid and host plants that follows the plant\u2013pathogen model proposed by Jones and Dangl11,12. Pathogens deliver effectors into the host to modulate plant immunity using a specific secretion system13,14. Aphids are also thought to secrete some salivary proteins as effectors into their host plants to alter cell metabolic processes and modulate plant defense responses15,16.",

Salivary secretions by aphids can also prevent phloem from clogging as a result of a plant wound response to enable phloem feeding to continue18. The essential roles of salivary protein C002 in the successful feeding of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphone pisum, on fava bean have been demonstrated using RNA interference19. Overexpression of M.persicae effector MpC002, potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae effectors Me10 and Me23 in Nicotiana benthamiana increased aphid fecundity, suggesting their ability to suppress plant defenses, however, in planta expression of Mp10 and Mp42 reduced aphid fecundity and Mp10 induced obvious chlorosis response in N. benthamiana, suggested these effectors involved in the activation of plant defense response20\u201322.",

Therefore, in this study, we directly dissected whole salivary glands from aphids (Fig. 1) and sequenced the transcriptome of the salivary glands of S. avenae. Of 33,079 unigenes identified in the whole salivary glands, 526 unigenes were predicted to encode secretory proteins, and some of their orthologs have been proved to play important roles in aphid-host interactions.

These transcripts ranged from 201 to over 14,923 bp with an average size of 941 bp. Among the transcripts, 22,532 (54.51%) were between 200 bp and 500 bp long, and 5,510 (13.33%) were over 2,000 bp. Also, among the assembled unigenes, 20,698 (62.57%) unigenes were between 200 bp and 500 bp long, and 3,120 (9.43%) were over 2,000 bp; mean length of unigenes was 711 bp (Fig. 2). All sequences of the unigenes in this study are provided in (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n",

However, insects possess many enzymes to degrade toxins and facilitate host adaptation to adverse conditions. Cytochrome oxidases, glutathione S-transferases and esterase have been suggested as important enzymes for resistance to plant secondary metabolites and insecticides in aphids and other insects48,49. We identified the transcripts of cytochrome oxidase (c1987_g1), glutathione S-transferase 1 (c14396_g2), esterase FE4 (c7566_g1) and esterase E4 (c12530_g1) in the salivary glands of S. avenae.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are involved in signaling pathways to activate plant defense responses and resistance to aphid. For example, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide at aphid feeding sites indicated reactive oxygen species are involved in early signaling of A. thaliana after infestation by the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae\n54. High levels of H2O2 accumulated in a resistant near-isogenic wheat line but not in a susceptible line after infestation by the D. noxia\n55. A sudden rise in oxygen concentration in sieve elements might result in protein coagulation in cucurbit phloem sap56. Additionally, high H2O2 levels in plants could be toxic to aphids. Peroxidase, acting as antioxidant enzymes involved in H2O2 scavenge, suggest that peroxidase detected in aphid salivary glands may protect aphids from plants oxidative stress as a detoxifying enzymes and play important roles in suppressing ROS production and ROS-induced plant defense responses.",

Lima bean Phaseolus lunatus treated with a solution of beta-glucosidase emitted more volatile compounds, which were similar to those emitted in response to red spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae infestation58. Leaves treated with commercial beta-glucosidase released volatile blends similar to that of leaves infested with cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae\n59. Also, the levels of plant defense signaling molecules salicylic acid, ethylene, and H2O2 in rice increased after the application of beta-glucosidase, and the defense signaling pathways induced by beta-glucosidase were similar to those activated by infestation with N. lugens\n60.",

Lipases also have been found in the salivary glands of some insects, including mosquito Anopheles stephensi\n61, M. destructor\n62, large milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus\n63 and E. fabae\n23. The primary function of lipases is presumed to be the breakdown membrane lipids and thereby the membrane; thus, they were first predicted to act as digestive enzymes to facilitate penetration of the cell membrane. However, Sch\u00e4fer et al. showed that lipases in grasshopper oral secretions induced accumulation of cyclopentenone 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), a precursor of JA biosynthesis in A. thaliana, and external application of lipase solution to wounded leaves also highly increased the levels of 13-hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic acid, OPDA, JA, and jasmonic acid-isoleucine, suggesting that lipases elicited plant defense responses64. Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids, which take part in lipid synthesis, lipid-derived signaling pathway and plant stress responses. It is assumed that phospholipases D (PLD) and its products, phosphatidic acid, are involved in plant signal transduction cascades and the lipid metabolic pathway to influence plant stress responses. Gene expression and enzyme activity of PLD increased rapidly after exposure to various stresses, such as mechanical wounding, frost and pathogen infestation65\u201367. Increases in the PLD transcripts and accumulation of PLD along the plasma membrane were observed after rice leaves were infected with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae\n68. Also, PLD participates in the production of plant defense response signaling molecules (ABA, ET, NADPH oxidase)66. Thus, lipases in S. avenae or lipase-derived molecules are likely to serve as effectors to induce downstream plant defense responses.",

            "text": "Trehalose, a kind of glucosidase in many organisms ranging from bacteria, fungi to plants78. Although the level of trehalose is very low in plants, many studies have demonstrated that it plays a regulatory role in sugar metabolism, growth, development and stress responses of plants79. Overexpressing trehalose biosynthetic genes of microbial and plant origin or receive exogenous trehalose, stress tolerance increased in several plants, such as tobacco, potato and rice80,81. We identified trehalase (c11521_g1, c13987_g1, c14644_g1), which degrades trehalose, in the salivary glands of S. avenae, and it has also been found in salivary glands of B. tabaci and the saliva of M. dirhodum and S. avenae\n24,34. Trehalase activity in A.thaliana increased before trehalose accumulated when infested with the trehalose-producing pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae, suggesting that trehalase may be a part of the plant defense responses and prevent excess accumulation of trehalose in plant cells82. Aphid-secreted trehalase may also play a role in interrupting trehalose accumulation to repress plant defense responses. However, a study showed that exogenous trehalose suppressed the transcript levels of some genes encoding enzymes related to plant defense, wound response, or pathogenesis, such as peroxidase-2 (PRXR2), basic endochitinase (ChiB), endo-1,3-b-d-glucanase (BGL1), lipoxygenase-2 (LOX2), and a chitinase-like protein 1 (CTL1)83. The role of trehalase in plant defense response needs further study.",

Transcripts of OBPs and CSPs have also been found in salivary glands of N. lugens, M.persicae, M.cerasi and bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi\n25,84. Insect OBPs and CSPs involved in olfaction and gustation are thought to be crucial for insect behaviors such as locating food and ovipository sites, as well as intraspecific communication85, and are mainly specifically expressed in chemosensory organs such as antennae and mouthparts and predicted to function in chemoperception86\u201388. However, some insect OBPs and CSPs are found in other tissues such as legs, heads, bodies and salivary glands86 with functions in insect development89, leg regeneration90, immune responses, and even interactions with the host. For example, Dengue virus (DENV) infection increased transcripts expression of OBP10 and OBP22 in the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti and silencing of the OBP10 or OBP22 genes resulted in a low efficiency of mosquito blood-feeding91. OBPs were found in the salivary glands of Anopheles gambiae and predicted to be secreted into host cells to manipulate host physiology by scavenging host amines92. Also, CSPs were identified using mass spectrometry as the most abundant proteins in the mandibular glands of larvae of the butterfly Vanessa gonerilla and speculated to play important roles in detecting microorganisms on plant surfaces, recognizing host plants and communicating with conspecifics93. CSP4 in cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera and oriental tobacco budworm Helicoverpa assulta possess unique functions that act as surfactants to reduce water surface tension and, consequently, pressure during sucking94, suggesting CSPs are involved in insect feeding. Among the CSPs identified in S. avenae, unigene c18419_g1 had high similarity to Mp10 known to be an effector in M. persicae. Mp10, a chemosensory protein was detected in the heads, salivary glands and whole bodies of M. persicae. Functional assays showed that overexpression of Mp10 in N. benthamiana suppressed bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flg22-induced defense responses, but induced chlorosis and local cell death in N. benthamiana, resulting in a decrease of M. persicae fecundity20,22. Thus, OBPs and CSPs secreted by salivary glands of S. avenae may play important roles in aphid-host interactions and warrant further functional study.",

Overexpression of Me10 in the host plant N. benthamiana increased M. persicae fecundity, suggesting its ability to suppress plant defenses21,52.

Among these 4 annotated unigenes, GLD (c12301_g1, c12029_g2) was described before and predicted to be an aphid effectors to promote aphid infestation. Unigene c13074_g1 and c29740_g1 were annotated as   MLH and TPR, respectively. MLH is a DNA binding protein and involved in plant salt tolerance mechanisms. The gene expression for MLH polyproteins is upregulated in the salt-tolerant genotype of Acer palmatum, suggesting it is involved in the improvement of plant resistance to abiotic stress101. The TPR motif is a protein-protein interaction module, which is important for the functioning of chaperones, cell-cycle, transcription, protein transport complexes and the gibberellin signal transduction pathway102,103. Gibberellins (GAs) represent an important class of plant hormones that control growth and developmental processes. We predict that TPR secreted by aphids may have roles in the interactions with plant proteins and affect plant development. The RT-PCR and RT-qPCR results showed that all of these highly expressed transcripts were specifically expressed in aphid salivary glands (Fig. 5a,b). Relative expression of the most highly expressed unigenes c10120_g1 and c12029_g2 (GLD) in salivary gland was 238.5 \u00b1 27.7 and 823.3 \u00b1 51.9 times higher than in the whole body, respectively. These highly expressed salivary gland-specific genes may play vital roles in aphid-plant interactions, and are worth further analysis.\n",

The expression levels of ACE and putative Ca2+ binding proteins RCN in salivary glands were significantly higher than those in other tissues. GST-1 transcript was specifically expressed in the salivary glands. Aphid salivary protein with GST activity involved in modifying plant defense responses, overexpression of a single putative GST protein named Me47 detected in M. euphorbiae saliva could induce or suppress plant defense depending on different host plants104. TRE and CALU had high expression in both salivary glands and alimentary canal. In our study, RT-PCR and qPCR results showed that RGN was very low in the salivary glands compared with its levels in the alimentary canal and whole body (Fig. 6a,b). RGN was found exclusively in the anterior fat bodies of the flesh fly Sarcophaga peregrine\n105, whereas the RGN protein was detected in the watery saliva of A.pisum\n34, suggesting that RGN may be mainly produced in the alimentary canal and other tissues such as fat bodies, then transported from the haemolymph into the salivary gland to be secreted into the host.\n",

Five hundred and twenty five putative secretory proteins that were expected to be secreted into plants and may play critical roles in aphid-host interactions were identified. Among of them, some highly and salivary gland-specifically expressed genes were also uncovered, but most of these putative secretory proteins were still function-unknown, which are worthy of further study. We also suggest a model describing the potential roles of some salivary proteins in aphid-host interactions (Fig. 7). Further investigations are needed to confirm these predicted secreted proteins at the proteomic level for a more comprehensive understanding of the composition of its saliva. RNA interference (RNAi)69\u201371 and transient over-expression of aphid candidate effectors in model plants or non-model crops such as wheat or barley20,106,107 and yeast two-hybrid screening108 are also valuable approach to further investigate the function of aphid salivary proteins in aphid-host interactions.\n",

During probing and feeding, the aphid secretes saliva into the cytoplasm of the plant cell. Digestive and detoxification enzymes () in salivary proteins facilitate probing and feeding because these enzymes are involved in the breaking down cell walls and membranes, metabolizing sugars and amino acids, and detoxifying secondary metabolites in plant tissues. Some digestive enzymes and degradative products also can induce plant defense responses as potential effectors. Some effectors () in saliva can be recognized by plant transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), resulting in the induction of plant basal defenses (pattern-triggered immunity, PTI). Aphid also secretes other effectors () to suppress plant defenses to promote infestation, resulting in effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS). However, in resistant interactions, an effector () can be specifically recognized by plant resistance proteins (R proteins) according to the gene for gene hypothesis, resulting in a stronger defense responses, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) such as induced cell death. Penetration of plant cell membranes by aphids causes an increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt), resulting in sieve pore occlusion and calcium signaling for defense responses such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Ca2+ -binding proteins () injected with saliva can bind Ca2+, thereby preventing sieve pore blockage and calcium signaling pathways. Also, the hole in the membrane created by the aphid can be sealed after the secreted gelling saliva solidifies into a sheath, minimizing the influx of Ca2+ and downstream plant defense responses. However, few effectors have been identified, and details of the mechanisms involved in aphid\u2013plant interaction are still unknown.
