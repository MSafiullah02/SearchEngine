Contact tracing is an essential tool for public health officials and local communities to change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Standard manual contact tracing of people infected with Covid-19, while the current gold standard, has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing through the use of mobile applications has the potential to shift the paradigm of Covid-19 community spread. Although some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems through either GPS or Bluetooth, more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or in for-profit corporations.",

The estimated risk can be used to provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant information to the user and connect them to health services. Finally, the non-identifying data about these risks can inform detailed epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor, and these models can provide statistical evidence for the interaction and importance of different factors involved in the transmission of the disease. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate and optimize different health policy and confinement/deconfinement scenarios according to medical and economic productivity indicators.",

In recent months, automatic contact tracing solutions have been proposed to address several of the challenges with manual contact tracing [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . They aim to reduce the cost and workload on healthcare professionals, the recall bias in remembering prior contacts, the inability to identify contacts from the general public (for example a supermarket worker), and the time delay between identifying whether a person was infected and manually alerting their contacts about a high-risk interaction with the person. Furthermore, while manual tracing can be very effective at the early stages of a potential epidemic, its efficacy declines as infection becomes more widespread and the number of contact tracers needed grows [16, 8] . Finally, it requires individuals to have a certain level of comfort in disclosing potentially sensitive information about their social circle to government officials [17] .",

Contact tracing as it is typically conceived requires that individuals provide some amount of personal information to state authorities [21] . With manual contact tracing, this takes the form of diagnosed patients trying to recall all of their physical encounters in the past two weeks and report them to a public health official, who then attempts to contact each individual listed and asks them to undertake a similar recall exercise. Automatic contact tracing, which relies on either Bluetooth or GPS from users' phones to detect when they have been in contact with each other, can also be implemented in a centralized way. The disclosure of personal information to state authorities takes the form of a centralized database that tracks contact encounters among identifiable individuals [14, 10] .",

There has recently been a robust debate on the difference between centralized and decentralized digital contact tracing, ranging from whether such a distinction is truly meaningful [24] to a focused critique of the privacy implications of centralized systems [25, 26] . These concerns may significantly limit the efficacy of such applications as citizens who do not trust an app would be unlikely to use it or use it appropriately. Democratic societies must therefore employ a privacy-protecting approach to digital contact tracing to enhance public trust in such applications [22, 20, 27] . The need for decentralized contact tracing has prompted a surge in proposals for privacy-preserving automatic contact tracing strategies [13, 11, 12, 15, 28] .

While most automated contact tracing proposals can only provide a binary notification (i.e., an individual either was exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid-19 or not), a more realistic multi-level risk gradation, where risk is based on additional factors such as symptoms, comorbidities, and occupation, allows for nuanced suggestions and an augmented understanding of individual and collective risk.

The application will be gathering baseline demographics and comorbidity which have been identified as being prognostic for acquiring a Covid-19 infection and having increased risk of adverse outcomes with an infection. Individuals can enter in real time the onset of symptoms and which specific symptoms may be occurring. Furthermore, the symptom profile can be updated over time, thereby creating a symptom evolution profile. These details are often challenging to acquire in epidemiological studies due to recall bias [34] . Such information will be integrated into ML and epidemiological models (see below) to gain a more granular understanding of viral transmission dynamics. It has been modeled that infectiousness can start approximately 2.5 days prior to symptoms onset with peak virulence in the day prior to symptom onset [35, 36 ] Viral shedding appears to plateau for 5-7 days, followed by a decline. While these details are key in understanding general viral profile in an infected individual, the ability to understand how this information translates into real-world viral transmission is limited [37] . By matching individual level symptoms onset, digital contact tracing, the individual profile, and details of the contact profile (as described in Section 1.2.1) with selfidentified and officially verified health data of Covid-19 diagnoses, COVI will provide critical information to enhance our understanding of real-world viral transmission and of the dynamics of the spread of the virus in the population of app users.",

With an understanding of how different user profiles influence infection risk, more targeted approaches to deconfinement can be proposed. The ML models can be provided in aggregate de-identified formats to local and regional public health agencies. This may inform region-specific strategies to loosen social distancing. COVI can further provide real-time and spatially localized feedback of viral transmission once such policy changes have occurred. This will be essential as governments cautiously explore deconfinement strategies.",

There are two principal reasons for COVI's privacy-centric approach. First, we regard privacy as a form of public good, having value for the proper functioning of democratic political systems [39, 40] and civil society generally [40, 41] . Massive adoption of contact tracing systems that do not sufficiently integrate privacy into the system design can pose a genuine danger to these institutions. Second, individuals all value their privacy at least to some degree, and because contact tracing depends so strongly on the network effect-there needs to be a critical mass of users with the app installed for it to be most effective-maximizing privacy protection therefore becomes a defining criterion for user adoption [42, 19] .",

Because automatic tracing systems can have far greater reach than manual tracing efforts, the potential effect on individual privacy is commensurately extensive. Despite the significant impact on privacy, however, the ability to collect data about the spread of the epidemic at a much faster rate than is possible with manual tracing may prove a key weapon to combat it.

This is done through cryptographic protocols to communicate securely between phones and between the server hosting the ML and epidemiological model. Finally, pseudonymized and aggregated data about users' individual and interaction profiles compiled with their consent is managed by an independent, not-for-profit organization whose sole mission is to protect the privacy, dignity and health of users for the time of the Covid-19 epidemic. This secured data will be used to train the ML predictive and epidemiological models. The data collected can never be used for commercial purposes, nor sold to private companies and will all be deleted as soon as the pandemic is over. Furthermore, information stored on user's devices will be purged on a rolling basis typically every 30 days (See Sec. 2.6.4).

Although diagnosed Covid-19 cases are maximum risk, individuals who haven't been diagnosed can still present non-zero risk, e.g. they might be asymptomatic but contagious. When these risk levels are substantially modified for a particular day in the past, they are then sent to all contacts of that day, enabling the network of COVI apps to recompute everyone's risk levels in a decentralized way, improving the overall accuracy of predictions.

In manual contact tracing, a health official uses their professional judgment when making recommendations to contacts, which is time consuming and requires substantial expertise. COVI aims to take advantage of ML to optimize and automate the integration of clues regarding the possibility that a person is infected, and use the resulting graded risk levels to drive appropriate recommendations and signals sent to other users so they can update their own risk assessment. Users of COVI can opt into sending their data (see Section 2.4) to COVI's secure ML server, where it is used to train two distinct but complementary models, the risk predictor and the epidemiological simulator.",

The computed personal risk levels are based on a combination of user-reported symptoms, demographic information, and information about contact events, including estimated contagiousness (risk levels) of those encountered. They are then used for two purposes. First, the current risk level is fed into the personalized recommendations the app makes to users (see below). More precisely, an ML model predicts the probability that a person has been infected, and how contagious that person was in the recent past and today. The estimated contagiousness in past days is crucial to inform the app of other users encountered in the recent past so that they can recompute their own risk levels. For example, imagine that Alice and Bob spent a lot of time together 3 days ago, and that because of newly available information, Bob's device estimates that he is probably infected and that he was likely very contagious in the last 4 days. Bob's phone would then send a message to Alice's device about his updated expected contagiousness 3 days ago. Alice's device would then recompute her risk levels. By having that updated risk information at a time when she could herself become contagious but before developing symptoms, COVI enables early awareness of possible contagiousness. COVI would highlight messages on Alice's app suggesting that she increase isolation and minimize contacts. If Alice reacts like most people who realize they may be infected, she will act responsibly and considerably reduce the silent spread of the virus which would have otherwise occurred. From a probabilistic perspective, the risk predictor takes observed data from the last two weeks and predicts the probability distribution of past unobserved variables (like having been infected during a particular encounter, or the degree of contagiousness on different days in the past).",

The epidemiological model includes prior knowledge about the relevant aspects of people's lives (like displacements and behaviours such as wearing a mask) and is structured around many conditional probabilities for the above events which change the state of the system. These conditional probabilities are parameterized and these parameters can be estimated, with methods described in Section 4, taking advantage of the risk predictor to sample the unobserved variables such as being infected and the degree of contagiousness. These epidemiological models can then be incorporated in a simulator that can be used by public health officials in several ways: to geographically map out the development of the disease (e.g., areas where people are getting infected faster), to understand the choices of citizens (e.g., where are people better or worse at following recommendations) and to better define the factors which matter for contagion and how they interact. These epidemiological models can also be used to simulate the evolution of the outbreaks under different hypothetical scenarios, and to optimize public policy with respect to objectives such as minimizing the number of hospitalizations due to the disease or keeping the daily reproduction number R t below 1.",

Psychological science has shown us that the best manner of doing this is not through coercion but by eliciting the evolving preferences of users. A large emphasis of COVI's design will thus be on creating measurement mechanisms (in-application surveys, focus groups, etc.) that allow us to better understand users and adjust settings and informational environments in a way that corresponds with their expressed (not assumed) best interests.

This additional information translates into more precise customized recommendations, and can have a significant impact on the ability of COVI to empower users with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and others, especially in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease. The use of ML to integrate complex clues which would otherwise require human intuition mitigates the absence of direct human intervention into a fully automatic contact tracing app. By sending multi-level risk levels and enabling accurate risk predictions, COVI can automatically give more relevant recommendations and perform triage on potential exposure events. Of course, users will receive recommendations to contact a health professional when appropriate, and by augmenting binary tracing with risk messages, COVI addresses the shortcomings of automated tracing.",

Especially if app installation is voluntary, it then becomes necessary to design apps that have greater privacy guarantees. Many apps have thus instead taken a partially centralized approach in the binary tracing setting, where only diagnosed users upload their contact/trace data to a central server. The central server can then use that data to notify users that they may have been exposed. Classical manual contact tracing falls into this category, as well as the augmented manual contact tracing app TraceTogether [10] . This partially centralized approach gives the central authority data on all diagnosed users and their contacts/traces, and is a compromise that seems to be gaining traction in some circles, such as the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing approach [14] . Unfortunately, this partially centralized approach is incompatible with COVI's sending of non-binary risk messages, because non-diagnosed users are sending around risk messages alongside infected users.

Typically, privacy laws permit the collection of information necessary to serve a core purpose of a service as a condition of service rather than an option. By making the collection and use of this necessary information optional, the COVI consent model goes well beyond what privacy laws require. Although arguably counterintuitive, our reasoning is easily explained. While the information collected for the purpose of training the machine learning model is necessary, it is only necessary that a certain quantity of such information be collected. For any given user, it is not necessary that information be collected from that user. As such, in recognition of the privacy preserving nature of the application, the application allows individuals to opt-in to allowing COVI Canada to access and use this information notwithstanding its necessity. The potentially sensitive analytics data obtained here is brought under this opt-in consent for similar reasons.

This is effectively a 10-bit code for each room, identifying it by which set of employees walked past their rooms. If employees 1, 3, and 5 walked past Bob's room, then his code would be 1010100000.

Of course, this information leakage should be kept in context, as a large governmental actor already has access to many other sources of tracking information, such as cell tower pings or CCTV feeds. Hence what really prevents these attacks is the legal framework and social norms in the country, along with the political strength of public opinion and media. Transparency in the management of COVI is thus of primary importance to alleviate such attacks.",

Next, all fine-grained geoboundaries (also called dissemination areas) that overlap with the identified cluster of municipalities are downloaded from the CDN if they are not already located on the device. This exchange with the CDN is limited to the clustered regions and should not leak significant location information with third-parties. Then, a second R-Tree is built on-device with the downloaded dissemination areas.

If the revision is sufficiently important (because the risk level changed from one discrete level to another), an updated message is sent to the other phone. For example, if a user starts having symptoms related to Covid-19, this user's phone would increase the probable contagiousness in the preceding days and send an update message to all the phones of the people this user met in the past 14 days. This enables each user to obtain an updated personalized risk level and propagate this updated risk across prior contacts. If the change in risk is significant enough (which is likely if new symptoms in a contact emerge or if a user just tested positive to the disease), an updated risk will then be propagated through update messages sent to the the user's past contacts. The purpose of the risk estimator is to predict a user's current and past contagiousness.

These static variables may be revised after installation but they are considered a static property of the person. In the simulator, these variables are sampled from a prior distribution P (static) based initially on known statistics, and when data are available from the app, from the population-level averages of these answers. Another very basic kind of variable consists in the displacements of everyone in the population. These displacements are not available for modeling directly but can be abstracted from other sources of mobility data in order to build a model of how and with what frequency people typically move around, from their home to their work, to hospitals or shops, etc. Let us lump these displacements under the mobility variable and call P (mobility) their distribution. Sampling from mobility gives hypothetical trajectories of hypothetical people spending time in different places in the simulation. Below, we note that mobility of a person may depend on awareness of the person (either because of her symptoms or because her phone warns her to take more precautions). Governmental public health policy can also influence mobility (e.g., by allowing or not different types of locations to operate normally). Hence the actual mobility model has the form P (mobility|awareness, public health policy). When they spend a few minutes near each other, this will trigger a contact. Thus the simulator has a process for capturing the conditional distribution P (contacts|mobility), which essentially amounts to finding out when two people spend 5 minutes or more in the same spatial grid cell. The specific attributes of the contacts may include how long and at what distances the two people were. Now some of these contacts will be recorded by people who have a phone with the COVI app and will constitute some of the observations available for training (minus the precise position and exact time of the encounter, for privacy protection).",

During the simulation, the following abstract variables are updated each day according to this order and the above logic: P (mobility(t)|awareness(t \u2212 1), public health policy) P (contacts(t)|mobility(t), messages(t \u2212 1)) P (infection(t)|contacts(t), static) P (medical observations(t)|infection(t)) P (risk levels(t)|phone data(t)) P (messages(t)|risk levels(t)) P (awareness(t)|risk levels(t))",

As a first step in building a predictor, we have in fact constructed an epidemiological simulator P based on medical and mobility statistics, and generated a large set of trajectories (e.g. 30 days over a population of 30,000 people in a town), thus leading to many (X, Z) pairs.

This would lead to a different P , one more faithful to the data distribution over X, and we would then need to retrain Q to be consistent with the new P (if Q is trained rather than a fixed procedure). Iterating this procedure is essentially the wake-sleep algorithm [87] . Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed to optimize a well-defined objective function. A modern variant of this idea was introduced in amortized variational methods such as the variational auto-encoder [86] . An upper bound on the log-likelihood log P (X) can be written which involves both P and Q and that can be optimized by gradient-based methods. This is for now our method of choice for training both P and Q together. We also propose to use samples from P (which may go outside of the range observed in X) to enrich the training of Q (in a fashion similar to the wake-sleep algorithm). This should help to address the challenge that the data distribution is not stationary, as society quickly evolves to face the pandemic. Keeping Q aligned with epidemiological knowledge not just around the data points X but more broadly should help bring more robustness to the system.",

Hence, jointly maximizing L over both P and Q has been found to be very successful in modeling observed data X when we suspect that it is better explained by invoking latent variables Z, which is exactly our situation. Classical variational methods optimized Q separately for each given X, whereas modern amortized inference methods like the variational autoencoder [86] parameterize Q(Z|X), e.g., as a neural network, and allow a faster inference at the time when the data are given. Instead the iterative optimization is done offline when training Q, while just computing the output of the neural network Q(Z|X) is very quick and can be performed on a phone, which makes amortized variational inference appealing for training the app's risk predictor. The ELBO can be maximized by usual gradient-based methods. The typical flow of computation proceeds as follows. Given the data available on one phone X up to some date, one samples latent variables Z from the risk predictor Q(Z|X). Then one computes the log of the joint probability log P (X, Z) as well as log Q(Z|X). Finally, one can back-propagate the ELBO into P to update its parameters and into Q to update its parameters. The only complication comes from the fact that Z includes both continuous variables (the contagiousness values for each day) and discrete variables (the contagion events). Back-propagating through the continuous variables is easy and efficient through the reparameterization trick [88, 86] . Propagating gradient information through the sampling of discrete variables is slightly more involved, with the simplest technique involving a Monte-Carlo approximation of the gradient obtained by sampling (once or a few times) the discrete variables and using the log-likelihoods of P and Q as reinforcement signals (similarly to what is done in the REINFORCE algorithm [89] and its variants). More sophisticated methods such as the Gumbell softmax method [90] lead to more efficient estimators at the price of a bit of bias in the gradient.",

Another ongoing question is how to scale simulations to large populations? Current simulations have been run on up to 30,000 individuals. How do we scale to the size of a country like Canada?

The exact time of encounters could tell us about the circumstances of the contagion (e.g at work during the day vs during the night sharing a bed) but is too sensitive an information when we want to avoid stigmatization (identifying who it was we met who had a high risk). Similarly, the contact graph is crucial from a privacy perspective (most people do not want anyone tracking who they met), and although it would be interesting to see how this impacts accuracy of predictions, we have chosen not to consider methods (like loopy belief propagation) which would require the contact graph in order to perform inference and learning.",

In the first case, to first approximation, Alice's probability of becoming infected may increase to approach that of Bob's. In the second case, the probability that Alice has been infected is very high because it is enough that any one of the 100 people were contagious for her to have become infected. This is why it is very important to make the difference between repeated and not-repeated contacts. Although the communication protocol makes it impossible to make an exact association between the different contacts, a probabilistic one can be made, and we have designed a clustering algorithm based on the risk levels and the time of arrivals of update messages to cluster the different contacts into blocks corresponding putatively to the same person. We use these noisy labels as extra input for the predictor. The last point has already been discussed in Section 2.6. (4) is when the different mobility policies are put in place.

The simulation was performed with the assumption that 60% of the population was using the app and users at the strongest level of recommendation (quarantine level) got tested.",

The contagiousness predicted by the transformer for each day in the past 14 days is converted to a 16-level (4 bit) message sent to the contacts of the corresponding day. The conversion from real-valued output to risk level was done by picking thresholds making the 16 bins of approximately equal frequency. The risk level for today was converted into a recommendation level. We used 4 recommendation levels in this simulation:",

For example, a risk level displayed prominently could be of interest to users, but a shopkeeper or employer might also demand to see the risk level screen of users as a condition for being admitted onsite. As Bruns and colleagues suggest [123] , these kinds of dynamics can create profound stigmatization risks which must be addressed through carefully planned risk mitigation strategies and appropriate social norms protecting the rights of individuals. Note that consent may not be a sufficient barrier for an employee who may have no choice but to accept the directives of their employer or lose their job. Further legal protection of privacy should be considered and put in place according to the collective preferences of citizens and the value of protecting the most vulnerable in society.

The training procedure for risk prediction and epidemiological modeling can then be modified to increase the weight of underrepresented groups, using a method of importance sampling or importance weighting.

Since the beginning, we have been proactive in ideating alternative solutions to accessing groups of people who are at-risk of being marginalized. In addition, our roadmap includes a very specific set of features that would allow the application to reach, albeit in a more limited way, members of at risk groups-e.g. custodial wallets for those who do not own a cellphone but have access to one. Finally, past research has shown that involving stakeholders from at-risk communities as domain-experts in the co-creation of solutions can drastically improve how \"data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process\" [126] .

Even the way that infectiousness is communicated to the user, i.e., in the form of recommendations which can depend on other factors, makes it more difficult for someone like a spouse or an employer, simply by looking at your phone, to get an explicit readout of the risk level (for example we avoid the kind of obvious colour scheme implemented in other apps).

These include consent, and trust, legal authority, necessity and proportionality, purpose limitation, de-identification, time-limitation, transparency and accountability and the deployment of safeguards.

COVI Canada's single mission of supporting Canadians in their fight against Covid-19 and not-forprofit nature ensure the data collected will never be used for commercial purposes, nor sold to private companies. It cannot be used for surveillance or to enforce quarantine by governments. The data is all stored in Canada and will be deleted as soon as the pandemic is over.

Of course, this requires a public discussion helping citizens understand what is at stake, and this democratic debate is a core component of COVI Canada's plan. Despite the many challenges associated with launching such a strategy, the balance achieved by COVI represents an important step in advancing the use of digital health and machine learning to combat a major world crisis. COVI aims to empower individuals by providing them with evidence-based and personalized information about their level of risk, thereby allowing them to act accordingly and responsibly to protect their loved ones and their community. COVI also empowers public health services with aggregated evidence which can be crucial to draw appropriate policies.
