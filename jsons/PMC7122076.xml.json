Wet your hands, apply soap and then scrub them vigorously for at least 15 s. Cover all surfaces of the hands and fingers, wash with water, and then dry thoroughly using a disposable towel (Fig. 48.1).Use an alcohol-based hand rub (e.g., 0.5% chlorhexidine with 70% w/v ethanol) if hands are not visibly dirty. A combination of chlorhexidine and alcohol is ideal as they cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, viruses, mycobacteria, and fungi. Chlorhexidine also has residual activity.During surgical hand preparation, all hand jewelries (e.g., rings, watches, bracelets) must be removed.Finger nails should be trimmed with no nail polish or artificial nails.Avoid wearing long sleeves, ties should be tucked in, house coats are discouraged, and wearing scrubs is encouraged.\n",

There are certain good practices to prevent CRBSI that include.Use of Chlorhexidine for daily bath in patients aged more than 2 monthsAvoidance of femoral site for planned CVC insertion in adults and obese patients. The preferred site in adult patients is the subclavian with due consideration regarding the risk for mechanical complications and subclavian vein stenosis. Femoral lines are preferably avoided due to higher rate of infection and thrombosis risks. In case a femoral catheter was inserted in emergency, it is preferable to change it to to an upper extremity site as soon as possibleThe central line site should be dressed with a sterile gauze or sterile, transparent, semipermeable dressing and should be changed with clean or sterile gloves only if it becomes damp, loose, or visibly soiledThe catheter insertion site should be inspected daily for any signs of infectionThe need for the intravascular catheter should be assessed daily and removed when not required.All administration sets should be changed appropriately e.g - every day in patients receiving blood, blood products, or fat emulsions. Every 6 or 12 h for propofol, and no less than 96-h intervals and at least every 7 days for routine IV sets.The needleless connectors should be changed every 72 h and all disposable or reusable transducers should be changed at 96-h intervals.Other practices include adequate staffing with maintained nurse-to-patient ratio, use of antimicrobial ointments at hemodialysis catheter-insertion site and to have a continuous surveillance for CLABSI in both ICU and non-ICU settings.",
