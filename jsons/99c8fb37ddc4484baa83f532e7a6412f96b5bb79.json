In 2004, a disease of ferrets characterized by clinical signs and lesions similar to those of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was first recognized in Spain and has since been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia (Mart \u0131nez et al., 2006; Garner et al., 2008; Perpi\u00f1 an and L opez, 2008; Laprie et al., 2009; Michimae et al., 2010; Murray et al., 2010; Terada et al., 2010; Wise et al., 2010) . The disease was initially called ferret infectious peritonitis (Johnson-Delaney, 2010) . A novel Alphacoronavirus, subsequently named ferret systemic coronavirus (FSCV or FRSCV) , has been confirmed to be the aetiologic agent (Garner et al., 2008; Terada et al., 2010) .

Five months prior to illness, the ferret had been legally imported from Spain via Chile with seven other ferrets. The animal underwent a 30-day quarantine period once in Chile and again in Peru. The ferret was reportedly vaccinated for canine distemper virus and rabies virus. Prior to submission, the ferret reportedly experienced eight days of hypothermia and diarrhoea before the owners hospitalized it in a private veterinary clinic. Although antibiotic and supportive treatment was administered for 2 days at the private clinic, the animal became anorexic and was referred to UNMSM.",

The ferret had hind limb paresis and a nervous tic in forelimbs and eyelids. A haematological evaluation revealed severe anaemia and leukocytosis. Therapy with enrofloxacin, sodium chloride 0.9%, vitamin B complex, vitamin C and hospitalization in a warm room (28-30\u00b0C) was initiated, but the animal died the next morning.",

Formalin-fixed tissues were sectioned at 5 lm, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a monoclonal antibody that targets the conserved region of the N gene of feline coronavirus. Domestic cat tissues infected by FIP virus were used as a positive control. RNA extractions from tissue samples were conducted using TRIzol ReagentTM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. Nested PCR was performed using generic primers, which amplify a 440-bp segment in the open reading frame (ORF) 1b region, encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The external primers were 5 0 GGKTGGGAYTAYCCKAARTG and 5 0 TGYTGTSWRCARAAYTCRTG (Chu et al., 2011) and the internal primers were 5 0 GGTTGGGACTATCCT AAGTGTGA and 5 0 CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA (Woo et al., 2005) .

            "text": "Based on immunohistochemical and molecular findings, FRSCV infection was diagnosed in a ferret imported from Spain to Peru. This is the first time systemic coronavirus infection of ferrets has been described in Latin America. The ferret had haematological values and clinical signs similar to those described for FRSCV-associated disease. However, these signs are relatively non-specific, and many other clinical signs associated with FRCSV were not observed, including palpable intra-abdominal masses, splenomegaly, nephromegaly, bruxism, sneezing/nasal discharge, systolic heart murmur, urine discoloration, dyspnoea, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, rectal mucosal erythema, seizures, opisthotonus, vomiting and pyrexia (Garner et al., 2008; Mart \u0131nez et al., 2008; Johnson-Delaney, 2010; Murray et al., 2010) .",

Histologically, FRSCV-associated disease is characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation particularly of the visceral peritoneum, mesenteric adipose tissue, liver, lungs, kidneys, lymph nodes, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, brain and/or blood vessels (Garner et al., 2008; Mart \u0131nez et al., 2008; Johnson-Delaney, 2010) . This is consistent with the findings in our case, in which the most striking gross lesions were widely scattered white nodules over abdominal and thoracic organs, which corresponded to pyogranulomatous inflammation, including pyogranulomatous vasculitis. In addition, histopathology of the brain revealed histiocytic meningoencephalitis.",

In Peru, ferrets have been imported as pets since late 2012, and the current population is believed to be <250 individuals (J. Lescano, personal communication). The ferret involved in our case was born in Spain and had a cumulative quarantine period (in Chile and Peru) of about 60 days. Thereafter, it lived in Lima city for about 90 additional days without showing any clinical signs. There was reportedly no contact with other ferrets than the imported group. This suggests the infection occurred in Spain, and the animal stayed clinically asymptomatic for approximately 150 days. Current knowledge about the pathogenesis of FRSCV-associated disease is scarce (Murray et al., 2010) , and there are no data on its incubation period. However, comparing with domestic cats, the development of FIP disease may occur during any stage after initial viraemia (Kipar and Meli, 2014) . Although this virus shared an identity of 93-95% with isolates from Japan, no sequences are available for comparison from Spain, and this similarity may not have any bearing on the origin of the virus.",
