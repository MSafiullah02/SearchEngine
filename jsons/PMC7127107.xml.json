Among the phlorotannins identified in Ecklonia species are eckol (a closed-chain trimer of phloroglucinol), phlorofucofuroeckol (a pentamer), and dieckol (a hexamer).7 Although a variety of pharmacological activities associated with compounds from E. cava have been demonstrated, these studies have shed little light on antiviral activities and mechanisms of E. cava against PEDV have not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the in vitro anti-PEDV activity of an ethanol (EtOH) extract and phlorotannins isolated from E. cava and evaluated their mechanisms of antiviral activity during virus replication cycle.",

To isolate the compounds, we subjected the EtOAc layer to a succession of chromatographic procedures, including silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and octadecyl-functionalized silica gel to yield five phlorotannins (1\u20135) as active principles. A spectroscopic (1H, 13C NMR, and MS) analysis and comparisons with previous studies18 identified the isolated compounds as the known species phloroglucinol (1), eckol (2), 7-phloroeckol (3), phlorofucofuroeckol (4), and dieckol (5) (Fig. 1\nC).7 Also, compound 4 and 5 within EtOH extract were shown to be present in high quantities by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1A and B).",

Of the five isolated phlorotannins, compounds 2\u20135 exhibited inhibitory activities with IC50 values ranging from 10.8 \u00b1 1.4 to 22.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcM (Table 1). The most potent phlorotannin, phlorofucofuroeckol (4), inhibited PEDV attachment with an EC50 value of 10.8 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcM (SI value = 53.6). The rank-order of antiviral activities was dieckol (5) (16.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u03bcM, SI = 29.5) > 7-phloroglucinoleckol (3) (18.6 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcM, SI = 23.9) > eckol (2) (22.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcM, SI = 17.2). Phloroglucinol (1) did not show significant inhibitory effects against PEDV in the simultaneous-treatment assay. From this, it may be inferred that the number of phloroglucinol moieties, and thus the number of hydroxyl groups, on the phlorotannin backbone contributes to blockage of viral entry to Vero cells. Although the structure activity relationships of phlorotannins were not thoroughly investigated, these results suggest that oligomerization and the existence of a cyclopentan ring (4) might be important for the in antiviral activity of these compounds.",

            "text": "PEDV entry into cells is a multistep process in which several interactions between viral spike (S) protein and cell surface receptors, including sialic acids (SA) and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), occur.21, 22 The SA-binding activity of some coronaviruses (TGEV and IBV) helps the virus penetrate the mucus layer and proceed to the intestinal enterocytes, where it interacts with pAPN to initiate infection.22, 23 Binding of virions to SA may somehow increase viral stability and facilitate virus infection in the gastroenteric tract.23 To further explore effects on virus adsorption and determine whether the EtOH extract and five compounds can block virus adsorption and cell entry, we tested the effects of the EtOH extract and compounds 1\u20135 on PEDV-induced hemagglutination binding to rabbit red blood cells (rRBCs). The EtOH extract completely inhibited PEDV attachment to rRBCs at less than 7.8 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 2\n). Among the five phlorotannins, eckol (2), phlorofucofuroeckol (4), and dieckol (5) showed particularly strong inhibition of hemagglutination, completely blocking virus attachment at 3.8\u20135.4 \u03bcM. But, compound 1 and 3 showed weak HI activity, requiring concentrations of 36.6 and 31.3 \u03bcM, respectively. Interestingly, the HI activity of compounds 2, 4, and 5 was similar to the antiviral activity of these compounds in simultaneous-treatment assay results (Table 1). Also, the compound 3 may be blocking the other way (such as pAPN-binding) for viral entry as well as SA-binding pathway because of exhibiting weak HI activity. Collectively, these results suggest that the effectiveness of compounds 2, 4, and 5 is mainly attributable to a strong interaction with S protein on the outer surface of PEDV, resulting in blockage of viral adsorption.",
