However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated 23 following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response 24 induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike 25 protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and 26 transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain 27 (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed 28 by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native 29 conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the 30 antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 31 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination 32 induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage 33 Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, 34 S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD 35 immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike 36 antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine 37 design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against 38 COVID-19 disease.",

The spike glycoprotein has been identified as the key target for protective antibodies 45 against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2(1-4). Consequently, multiple versions of the SARS-46 CoV-2 spike proteins are currently under evaluation as vaccine candidates utilizing different 47 modalities and delivery systems(5). However, only limited knowledge exists on antibody 48 repertoire or quality of the immune response generated following vaccination by different spike 49 vaccine antigens. Therefore, it is important to perform comprehensive evaluation of post-50 vaccination antibody response to elucidate the quality of the immune responses elicited by spike-51 based vaccine candidates to determine immune markers that may predict clinical benefit which 52 can facilitate evaluation of vaccine candidates. 53 To better understand vaccination-induced antibody response, we immunized rabbits with 54 several SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins: the S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213) lacking the 55 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (delta CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-56 binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213), as a control. Post-57 vaccination sera were analyzed by Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries covering the entire 58 spike gene (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL) to determine the polyclonal antibody epitope repertoire 59 generated following vaccination as previously applied for other diseases(6-10). In addition, we 60 employed several antibody binding assays (ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based real-61 time kinetics assay) (10-12) and an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion neutralization assay to 62 measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different SARS-CoV-immunization with SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens 68 Most spike-based vaccines currently under development are designed to contain the 69 receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 319-541) in some form.
