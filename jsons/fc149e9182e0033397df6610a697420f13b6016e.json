Objective: We examined 951 respiratory samples collected in Queensland, Australia, between November 2002 and August 2003 from patients with respiratory infection, for the presence of the KI virus. Results: Twenty-four (2.5%) samples were positive for KI virus with 20 (83%) of these from children younger than 5 years. In six (25%) patients KI was co-detected with another virus. Full genome sequencing of three isolates shows a high degree of conservation between the Queensland isolates and the original isolates reported from Swedish patients. Conclusions: The newly described KI polyomavirus may commonly be found in the respiratory tract of patients with ARTI, particularly children, and results indicate that the virus has global presence.

The viral respiratory pathogens that are commonly recognised include rhinoviruses (HRV), coronaviruses (HCoV), influenza viruses (IFV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenoviruses (ADV). However, despite exhaustive investiga-tion, a significant proportion of respiratory infections cannot be accounted for by these viruses, suggesting that additional respiratory pathogens are still likely to exist (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003) . Over the last 6 years, the search for these agents has led to the detection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) , human coronaviruses, SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003) , NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) , human bocavirus (HBoV) (Allander et al., 2005) and very recently, human KI polyomavirus (KIV) (Allander et al., 2007) . Allander et al. (2007) showed that KIV was phylogenetically related to other primate polyomaviruses in the early region of the genome, but has very little homology in the late region. They found KIV by PCR in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), and in one (0.5%) of 192 faecal samples, but did not detect it in sets of urine and blood samples.

Different family members infect several species of mammals, including humans, other primates, rodents, rabbits as well as birds. Before KI virus, two human polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) were described which are ubiquitous worldwide (Stolt et al., 2003) . Although it is postulated that these polyomaviruses utilise a respiratory route for transmission, detection of their nucleic acids in the respiratory tract is rare (Goudsmit et al., 1982; Sundsfjord et al., 1994) . Normally infection with JCV and BKV in immunocompetent hosts results in asymptomatic infection, but in the immunocompromised these viruses may cause significant disease. JCV may be the cause of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while BK virus has been associated with tubular nephritis in renal transplant recipients and haemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients (Arthur et al., 1986) . Following primary infection, these viruses may persist in the kidney and can periodically re-emerge in the host (Behzad-Behbahani et al., 2004; Markowitz et al., 1993) . Following the report describing KIV, we sought to determine the presence of this virus in a well-characterised population of respiratory samples collected from Queensland subjects with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 435, "text": "(Stolt et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 602, "end": 625, "text": "(Goudsmit et al., 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 626, "end": 650, "text": "Sundsfjord et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1069, "text": "(Arthur et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1215, "text": "(Behzad-Behbahani et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1239, "text": "Markowitz et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Nine hundred and fifty one respiratory samples, including 887 NPAs and 64 bronchoalveolar lavages, collected in Queensland from November 2002 to August 2003 from patients presenting to hospital with ARTI were examined for the presence of KIV by PCR.
