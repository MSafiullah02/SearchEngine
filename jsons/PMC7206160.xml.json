Conventional applications of demographic prediction tend to pay attention to users\u2019 behavior in social networks, and few people pay attention to mobile and sensor devices. However, sensor data for demographic prediction has it\u2019s own unique applications. For example, it\u2019s hard to use online speech to infer the age and gender of a person who rarely speaks on social networks, but it\u2019s easier to infer such attribute via his or her pedometer records, as the walking is a daily stable behavior. Besides, the attributes predicted through sensor data could be directly used to enable human-computer interaction more humanized and friendly in smart home system. For example, when a young lady go home from outside, the air conditioning and audio could select a gender/age-aware response (air conditioning temperature and music) from many possible candidates to make the user more comfortable [10].",

They mostly come from Facebook [12], Twitters [2, 13], microblogs [17], YouTube [4], web search queries [6], social networking chats [11], and forum posts [3]. And little work is put into the management of sensor data. Besides, traditional demographic prediction model can not fully learn the complementary correlations between different attributes. Existing work usually infer users\u2019 different attributes separately without taking account of correlation learning or infer all the attributes together using shared embedding at the bottom of model. For example, wang et al. [16] proposed a Structured Neural Embedding (SNE) model that use shared embedding to leverages the potential correlations for multi-task learning by concatenating structured label. However, the concatenated formalization makes the prediction task more difficult than separated tasks since the output space for each task becomes much larger. Raehyun et al. [8] proposed an Embedding Transformation Network (ETN) model that shares user representations at the bottom and converts them to task-specific representations using a linear transformation. But this model does not take any steps to explicitly learn the complementary relationship between different task-specific features.",

Then, to well learn complementary correlations between different tasks, we design a correlation learning layer with full connection neural pipelines to capture correlation features. Moreover, we enhance the user representation with correlation features using bilinear model.

According to this result, it could be demonstrated that capturing such correlations has great significance in multi-task prediction.As we emphasized in this paper, the ability to learn correlations between different tasks is important in multi-task learning. JNE, SNE, ETN and ETNA use the shared embedding that implicitly leverage these correlations, but ignore the interferences among multiple tasks. We first use the separated embedding to avoid such interference, and then employ the correlation learning to obtain the correlations. Although we use the most simple architectures of our models for baseline comparison (see Sect. 4.4), which still outperform all the baselines with a significant gap.The attention mechanism is helpful for separation embedding. As shown in Table 2, the CANEA is obviously better than the CANEA\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^{\\mathrm {b}}$$\\end{document}.
