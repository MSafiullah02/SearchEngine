The proteins protruding from the viral membrane (especially the spike [S] protein) give these pathogens their characteristic halo-like appearance under the electron microscope, which has led to the name corona (Latin: garland, crown). 3 All CoV have in common that their genome is in the form of a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) with positive polarity, meaning that the base sequence of the RNA is in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 orientation and corresponds to the later messenger RNA (mRNA). With a length of 26.4-31.7 kilobases, the genome of CoV is the largest RNA genome of all known RNA viruses. 4 Besides a number of nonstructural proteins including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the viral RNA encodes 4 essential structural proteins, namely the nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounding the RNA genome and 3 membrane proteins: the Sglycoprotein, the matrix (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. 5 The S-glycoprotein on the surface of CoV can attach to the cellular receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells. 6 ACE2 is found in the lower respiratory tract",

In most cases, these endemic HCoV cause relatively mild diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract and are estimated to account for about a third of all \"common colds\" in humans. Asymptomatic infections have also been described. In some cases, especially in immunosuppressed individuals, children, or persons with existing pulmonary diseases, progression to acute respiratory failure can also occur. 15 The situation completely changed with the appearance of the SARS-CoV. 16 This virus caused serious human respiratory diseases in China in 2002-2003. Approximately 8000 people were affected by the disease at that time, with case fatality rate (mortality rate) of around 9.5%. SARS-CoV spread could be stopped by the rapid development of a detection method and extensive measures to isolate infected individuals. Subsequent studies in wild animals showed that SARS-related CoV are found in bats and civet cats, hence it was assumed that the virus spread from the civet cat to humans, followed by human-to-human spread. 17 While no human infections with the original SARS virus have been reported since 2004, another CoV dangerous for humans emerged in 2012. The MERS-CoV was isolated for the first time from a patient who was hospitalized with acute pneumonia in Saudi Arabia. 18 By 2019, around 2500 MERS-CoV infections have been reported in humans, with about a 30% case fatality rate. 14 The main risk area for MERS-CoV infections is the Arabian Peninsula. Infections were reported to be both through human-to-human transmission and through contact with dromedaries (camels). These animals appear to represent a reservoir for MERS-CoV. 19 SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 At the end of December 2019, China reported the increasing occurrence of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In January 2020, a novel \u03b2-CoV was identified as the cause. 20 When the virus was first isolated from pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As more information and genetic analyses became available, the virus was given the official name of SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, while the WHO named the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19.",

The virus is highly transmissible in humans and causes severe problems especially in the elderly and people with underlying chronic diseases. COVID-19 patients typically present with specific, similar symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and cough. 25, 26 Most adults or children infected with SARS-CoV-2 have presented with mild flu-like symptoms, but a few patients are in critical condition and rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and even death. 27 According to a recent report, the common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), and headache (13.6%). 28 A minor number of patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms, with diarrhea (3.8%) and vomiting (5.0%). Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms, whereas upper respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare. The case fatality rate increases with the severity of illness and can reach up to 49% in critically ill patients. 1 Unfortunately, no specific therapeutic options are currently available. Only supportive measures can be applied at the moment. 29 ",

Preclinical studies suggested that remdesivir (GS5734) could be effective for both prophylaxis and therapy of HCoVs infections. 32 This drug was positively tested in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection 33 and has been reported to treat the first case in the United States of COVID-19 successfully. 34 Accordingly, 2 large clinical trials, NCT04252664 for mild/moderate COVID-19 and NCT04257656 for severe COVID-19, were initiated in China, with an estimated end date in early April 2020.",
