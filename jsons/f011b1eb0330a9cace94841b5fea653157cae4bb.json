The GP1 subunit of the surface glycoprotein mediates cell attachment through transferrin receptor 1 (Tf R1). We report the structure of Machupo virus (MACV) GP1 bound with human Tf R1. Atomic details of the GP1-Tf R1 interface clarify the importance of Tf R1 residues implicated in New World arenavirus host specificity. Analysis of sequence variation among New World arenavirus GP1s and their host-species receptors, in light of the molecular structure, indicates determinants of viral zoonotic transmission. Infectivities of pseudoviruses in cells expressing mutated Tf R1 confirm that contacts at the tip of the Tf R1 apical domain determine the capacity of human Tf R1 to mediate infection by particular New World arenaviruses. We propose that New World arenaviruses that are pathogenic to humans fortuitously acquired affinity for human Tf R1 during adaptation to Tf R1 of their natural hosts.",

The atomic details of the GP1-Tf R1 interface clarify the importance of several receptor residues implicated in New World arenavirus host specificity. On the viral glycoprotein side of this interface, there is substantial residue-sequence variability among GP1 proteins that bind the human receptor. We correlate this variability with differences among the sequences of the hostspecies Tf R1 orthologs, which can serve as efficient receptors for the corresponding virus 18, 23 . The specificities of the viral glycoproteins reflect long-term adaptation of the viruses in their natural hosts 24 ; our data suggest that the New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses independently and fortuitously acquired their ability to bind human Tf R1 and hence to cause human disease.",

This segment was poorly defined in previous structures of hTf R1 (refs. 21,25) , which were determined at lower resolution (3.1 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5), and further analysis of the electron density in the unliganded hTf R1 structure 21 (PDB 1CX8) in light of our higher-resolution model shows that residues 208-212 in unliganded hTf R1 adopt a very similar \u03b2-strand conformation (Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Thus, GP1 binding induces no major main chain distortions in the Tf R1 apical domain. It does, however, increase order in the extended \u03b2II-2 strand, displace the backbone, and change the orientation of Leu209 and switch the rotameric state of Tyr211 (Supplementary Fig. 2b) .",

The sequences of MACV, JUNV, GTOV and SABV GP1 diverge substantially-based on the alignment shown in Figure 2b , the pairwise identities of MACV GP1 residues 87-242 with the corresponding GP1 sequences of JUNV, GTOV and SABV are 46%, 27% and 25%, respectively-but hTf R1 is a cell-entry receptor for all three viruses 17, 19 . TCRV (41% identify with MACV GP1) can use hTf R1 when either Arg208 or Val210 in the hTf R1 \u03b2II-2 strand is mutated to glycine, suggesting that modest changes in its GP1 protein might also allow it to bind human Tf R1 (ref. 23) . Amapari virus (AMAV, 29% GP1 sequence identity with MACV) can use hTf R1 when four mutations are made to the \u03b2II-1-\u03b2II-2 loop and \u03b2II-2 strand in the receptor 23 . Thus, all six GP1 receptor-binding domains appear to be complementary to the same surface. Location of conserved residues in GP1 justifies the further assumption that, despite considerable sequence divergence, all New World arenavirus GP1s have the same framework structure. MACV GP1 has two long-range disulfide bonds (one between Cys92 and Cys237, bounding the entire domain, and the other between Cys135 and Cys164, bridging across the hydrophobic core) and two short-range disulfide bonds (from Cys207 to Cys213 and from Cys220 to Cys229, stabilizing local loops). The alignment in Figure 2b shows that the two long-range disulfide bonds are conserved and that the short-range disulfides are unique to MACV. The alignment predicts that GTOV GP1 will have an additional long-range disulfide between Cys120 and Cys164 (MACV numbering) and that AMAV GP1 will have a long-range disulfide between Cys116 and Cys213 (MACV numbering). Both disulfide pairings are fully compatible with a conserved fold. SABV GP1 has a short insertion following residue 107 (MACV numbering) with an unpaired cysteine, which projects away from the Tf R1 interface and probably bridges to a cysteine elsewhere in the viral glycoprotein. Figure 4a shows the viral side of the GP1 interface, with GP1 residues grouped according to the five interaction motifs. In viral contributions to interaction motif 1, the hydrogen bond between MACV GP1 Ser113 and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tf R1 Tyr211 can also be made by the threonine at that position in SABV and by the aspartate in JUNV and TCRV GP1 (Fig. 4b) . GTOV in SABV and proline in GTOV. MACV GP1 Arg111, which makes prominent contacts with the Tf R1 \u03b2II-2 strand, is not conserved in any of the other viruses. In motif 2, Tf R1 Asn348 has reciprocal hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain amide and carbonyl of MACV GP1 Ser116; the side chain of this residue does not participate, nor is it conserved in any of the GPs. Interaction motif 3 is unique to MACV, as it involves the insert in loop 10. In motif 4, three of five MACV GP1 residues that contact Tf R1 are conserved in the other clade B1 viruses TCRV and JUNV, and four of five are conserved between MACV and JUNV. However, substantial variability is seen in this motif when GTOV, AMAV and SABV are compared with the clade B1 viruses. In motif 5, Phe98 is replaced by a more polar residue in the other viruses, as might be expected, as absence of loop 10 would leave this phenylalanine substantially more exposed.",

GTOV can use only the Tf R1 ortholog of its host (ZbTf R1, from Zygodontomys brevicauda) and that of the closely related New World arenavirus AMAV (NsTf R1, from Neacomys spinosus) 18, 23 . The restricted receptor usage of each virus clearly reflects a relatively long period of virus-host co-adaptation 24 . Figure 4c shows the receptor side of the GP1-Tf R1 interface. Tf R1 Tyr211, the central feature of motif 1 (Fig. 3a) , is conserved in all the host-species receptors (Fig. 4d) . Tf R1 Asn348, which anchors the second interaction motif (Fig. 3b) , is likewise conserved, except in CmTf R1 (JUNV host), which has a lysine at position 348. MACV cannot use CmTf R1 as a receptor, and the N348K substitution in the context of hTf R1 consistently disrupts the entry of MACV and GTOV into cells expressing this altered receptor 18 . The lysine at 348 would disrupt the hydrogen bond network that includes the C cap on Tf R1 \u03b1II-2 and the main chain hydrogen bonds with MACV GP1 Ser116 (Fig. 3b) . Presumably, JUNV, in adapting to the receptor of its native host, has evolved to accommodate Lys348 in binding to CmTf R1. In motif 3, the interaction unique to MACV, most of the receptors present a hydrophobic surface (valine or leucine at position 210 and leucine at position 212: Fig. 3c) . The exceptions are CmTf R1 and AjTf R1 (from Artibeus jamaicensis). The former has a serine at position 210 and a proline at position 212; the latter, a glycine at position 210. Loop 10 of MACV GP1 engages this hydrophobic surface, with MACV GP1 Phe226 inserted between the side chains of Tf R1 residues 210 and 212. The details of the contact suggest that C\u03b3 of proline at position 212 would clash with the Phe226 side chain, consistent with the failure of MACV efficiently to infect cells expressing CmTf R1 (ref. 18) .",

Another difference in motif 4 is Tf R1 residue 294, which is aspartate in the host receptor for MACV (and also those for JUNV, GTOV and AMAV) but glutamate in hTf R1. An aspartate side chain at this position cannot reach the \u03b5-amino group of GP1 Lys169 (conserved in the clade B1 viruses), but the salt bridge can be replaced by one from Tf R1 residue 340, which is glutamate rather than alanine in precisely those receptors that have the aspartate substitution at position 294.",

The corresponding position is occupied by glycine in all New World arenavirus host-species receptors examined here, with the exception of the MACV host (CcTf R1), in which the position is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 4d) . The R208G mutation converts hTf R1 into a receptor for TCRV 23 . Because most of the viruses are probably best adapted to the absence of a large side chain at the 208 position in Tf R1, we asked whether an R208G change in hTf R1 also affects the infectivity of MACV, JUNV and GTOV. We generated fusion proteins comprising the truncated GP1 subunits of MACV, JUNV or GTOV fused to the Fc portion of Cc Cm Aj Zb Ns a r t i c l e s human IgG (GP1\u2206-Ig) 17 and tested them for binding to CHO cells transfected with wild-type (WT) hTf R1 or hTf R1 R208G. MACV GP1\u2206-Ig bound CHO cells expressing either WT hTf R1 or hTf R1 R208G but bound the latter more strongly (Fig. 5a) . JUNV and GTOV GP1\u2206-Ig bound only cells expressing hTf R1 R208G. Lack of detectable binding by JUNV and GTOV GP1\u2206-Ig to cells expressing WT hTf R1 probably resulted from the low affinity of these proteins for the wild-type receptor. Consistent with these data, the R208G mutation modestly enhanced infectious entry of MACV pseudovirus but led to substantial increases in infection by JUNV and GTOV pseudoviruses (Fig. 5b) . The tip of the Tf R1 apical domain (motif 5) is thus a determinant of entry by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic New World clade B arenaviruses. The rodent receptors all have a simple, fourresidue \u03b2-turn in the \u03b2II-1-\u03b2II-2 loop, whereas human Tf R1 has a five-residue turn. The pathogenic viruses (MACV, JUNV and GTOV) have presumably adapted in their natural hosts to the shorter turn, which places a glycine at the 209 position instead of leucine. The substitution eliminates the hydrophobic contact we see between hTf R1 Leu209 and MACV GP1 Phe98 (Fig. 3e) . The alternative interactions that we have suggested might be present in different virus-host pairs vary in character and position, and we therefore cannot readily predict from GP1 sequences alone how many residue changes might be needed to make any particular nonpathogenic New World clade B arenavirus infectious in humans without compromising ability to propagate in its natural host.",

Although present in all mammalian Tf R1s, the apical domain does not have a known physiological role: neither transferrin nor the hereditary hemochromatosis associated protein, HFE, interact with it 22, 25 . As New World arenavirus GPs engage Tf R1 in a manner that does not seem to interfere with binding of its known physiological ligands 17 , antibodies that target the Tf R1 apical domain might in principle be useful as broadly-acting therapeutic agents for acute treatment of New World hemorrhagic fevers. Our structure, when compared with the structure of unliganded MACV GP1 (ref. 26) , shows that no significant conformational change occurs upon receptor binding (C\u03b1 r.m.s. deviation = 0.55). Receptor binding is therefore unlikely to prime GP for pH-induced membrane fusion before virions are internalized into endosomes as seen, for example, with the avian leukosis virus 27, 28 . The events during New World arenavirus cell entry may be more similar to those during entry of influenza viruses into cells, in which hemagglutinin attachment to a cell-surface receptor (sialic acid) serves primarily to traffick virions to acidified endosomes rather than to initiate a series of conformational rearrangements 14 .",

This sequence variability, which presumably reflects the independent evolution of individual viruses in their various host species 24 , is best illustrated by the insert in MACV loop 10, which forms extensive receptor contacts yet is much shorter and lacks these contacts in the other viruses (Fig. 3b) . Nonetheless, a number of similarities among the GP1 receptor-binding domains strongly support the assumption of a shared fold within members of the family. Conservation of key receptor residues in several of the interaction motifs indicates conservation of local features of the interface as well as of the overall docking of the two partners. The structure of the complex may therefore prove useful in predicting whether a novel New World arenavirus is likely to use Tf R1. For example, extending the analysis shown in Figure 4 to the recently isolated New World hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Chapare suggests that this virus will indeed use Tf R1 as its receptor 8 (Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

That loop is longer by one residue in human Tf R1 than in its ortholog in any of the New World arenavirus native hosts, except for that of TCRV. Moreover, at the end of that loop, Arg208 in the human receptor becomes glycine in the host-species receptors (with the exception of the MACV host, where it is an asparagine), and the R208G mutation enhances infectivity of JUNV and GTOV and allows infection by TCRV. The large arginine residue thus presents a barrier to use of human Tf R1 by both nonpathogenic 23 and pathogenic New World clade B arenaviruses (Fig. 5) . The New World clade B arenaviruses appear to be adapted best to their host-species receptors. We suggest that those infecting humans accidentally acquired the capacity to bind human Tf R1 during coevolution with the receptor in their natural hosts. The structure of MACV GP1 bound to hTf R1 thus clarifies the complex structural basis for the zoonotic transmission of this important class of emerging human pathogens. ",

Iterative model building and refinement with PHENIX 32 yielded final R free of 24% and R work of 20% ( Table 2) ; 96.8% of all residues were in the most favored region of Ramachandran space, and 99.9% (782/783 residues) were in allowed regions.

We generated MACV GP1\u2206-Ig, JUNV GP1\u2206-Ig, and GTOV GP1\u2206-Ig by PCR amplification of MACV GP1 residues 87-258, JUNV GP1 residues 87-241 and GTOV GP1 residues 79-228. We cloned these fragments into a previously described pcDM8-based plasmid containing the CD5 signal sequence and the Fc region of human IgG1 (ref. 38) . The SARS-CoV RBD Ig fusion protein has been described previously 38 . For Ig fusion protein production, we transfected HEK 293T cells with the appropriate plasmid and harvested the supernatant at 48 h after transfection. For binding assays, we transfected CHO cells with hTf R1 or hTf R1 R208G. After 48 h, we detached the cells with 1 mM EDTA in PBS and incubated them in 100 \u00b5l of PBS containing 2% goat serum and 0.5 \u00b5g of an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or supernatant containing 0.5 \u00b5g of the indicated Ig fusion protein. We then stained the cells with anti-mouse IgG or with anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin (Jackson Immuno Laboratories).Pseudovirus infection. We generated recombinant retroviruses by transfecting HEK 293T cells in a 1:1:1 ratio of plasmids encoding the respective arenaviral GP, the MLV gag and pol genes and the pQCXIX retroviral vector (BD Biosciences) expressing GFP, as previously described 17 . We harvested cell supernatants 24 h after transfection and filtered them through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter. We transfected CHO cells with plasmids expressing WT hTf R1 or hTf R1 R208G and replated the cells at 24 h for flow cytometry and pseudovirus infection. At 48 h after transfection, we assessed Tf R1 expression levels by flow cytometry using an anti-Flag M2 antibody. In parallel, we infected the cells with the pseudoviruses for 1 h. We detached the cells with trypsin 48 h after transfection and measured the GFPexpression levels by flow cytometry. We normalized GFP-expression levels to that of mock-transfected cells.",
