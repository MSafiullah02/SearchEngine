HCV entry into the hepatocytes is complex and involves several host factors. The tetraspanin human CD81 (hCD81) is one of the four essential entry factors and is composed of one large extracellular loop, one small extracellular loop, four transmembrane domains, one intracellular loop and two intracellular tails. The large extracellular loop interacts with the E2 glycoprotein of HCV. Regions outside the large extracellular loop (backbone) of hCD81 have a critical role in post-binding entry steps and determine susceptibility of hepatocytes to HCV. Here, we investigated the effect of five non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants in the backbone of hCD81 on HCV susceptibility. We generated cell lines that stably express the hCD81 variants and infected the cells using HCV pseudoparticles and cell culture-derived HCV. Our results show that all the tested hCD81 variants support HCV pseudoparticle entry with similar efficiency as wildtype hCD81. In contrast, variants A54V, V211M and M220I are less supportive to cell culture-derived HCV infection. This altered susceptibility is HCV genotype dependent and specifically affected the cell entry step. Our findings identify three hCD81 genetic variants that are impaired in their function as HCV host factors for specific viral genotypes. This study provides additional evidence that genetic host variation contributes to inter-individual differences in HCV infection and outcome.",

HCV is hepatotropic and is classified into seven genetically distinct genotypes (GTs) [3] . HCV enters into hepatocytes in a coordinated multistep process, which involves sequential interactions between viral particles and several host cell-surface factors. These include the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), the tetraspanin hCD81, the tight junction components claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) [4] [5] [6] [7] . Eventually, the viral uptake into the endosomes occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [8] . The fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane leads to viral-RNA release into the cytosol, thereby completing cell entry of the virus.",

Some could explain the inter-individual variability in disease progression or in treatment response. For instance, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860, upstream of IL28B gene which encodes the type III interferon, is associated with HCV treatment response and clearance [9] [10] [11] . With regard to HCV entry factors, OCLN has several coding non-synonymous SNPs, which differ between populations with minor allele frequencies ranging between 1 and 2.5% [12] . Three of the SNPs tested using HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCV cell culture-derived particle (HCVcc) had no effect on OCLN functioning as HCV-entry factor. Furthermore, the SNPs do not modify direct cell-to-cell spread of HCV, which requires OCLN [12] . Two coding non-synonymous SNPs in the SCARB1 gene that encodes SR-BI are associated with reduced HCV cell entry. Additionally, a non-coding variant (G allele in rs3782287) is linked to a decreased HCV viral load in patients [13] . Taken together, these findings suggest that coding and non-coding variants of SCARB1 influence the HCV replication cycle.",

CD81 also participates in many bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, such as Listeria monocytogenes [15] , Plasmodium [16] , influenza virus [17] , human immunodeficiency virus [18, 19] , human papillomavirus type 16 (Finke et al., this reference is a part of the same MMIM Special Issue) and HCV. In the case of HCV, the viral glycoprotein E2 interacts directly with the LEL of the CD81 protein in the early stages of HCV entry [5] . More than 60 coding non-synonymous low-frequency variants of hCD81 exist [20] . Seven hCD81 variants are known to support HCV entry in vitro: six of them located in the LEL and one in the transmembrane domain 4 (TM4). The variants do not have an effect on direct cell-to-cell spread of HCV and on neutralization by different CD81 antibodies [21] . Apart from binding to HCV, CD81 is involved in protein-protein and lipid interactions, which are important for post-binding events in the HCV replication cycle.",

The regions outside the LEL (here referred to as a backbone) have a critical role in post-binding HCV entry steps [26] . Moreover, the CD81 backbone is involved in cholesterol coordination. The crystal structure of hCD81 revealed a cholesterol-binding pocket between the two C-terminal transmembrane helices. According to molecular modelling, the presence or absence of cholesterol in this binding site seems to modify the conformation adopted by the LEL domain, thereby modulating the activity of CD81 [27] . Importantly, a point mutation of the E219 residue of TM4, important for cholesterol binding, reduces infectivity of HCV [26] .

We expressed the different hCD81 variants in Lunet N#3 cells, which have undetectable endogenous hCD81 levels [28] , and characterized them by flow cytometry, Western blot and confocal microscopy to determine the expression. Finally, we performed HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCV cell culture-derived (HCVcc) infection assays to investigate whether the hCD81 variants can function as HCV entry factors. Different inter-genotypic HCV chimeras bearing the glycoproteins from five of the major clinical HCV genotypes were included to investigate if hCD81 variants differentially influence infection. The results indicate that non-synonymous SNVs A54V, V211M and M220I in the backbone of hCD81 render hepatoma cells less susceptible to HCV infection in comparison to the wild-type (WT) hCD81. These findings further increase our knowledge on inter-individual differences in HCV host factors and the possible impact on the course of disease.",

To this end, we transduced lentiviral pseudoparticles harboring the different hCD81 variants into Lunet N#3 cells, known to have undetectable levels of endogenous hCD81 [28] . We named the generated cell lines by the missense mutation that they carried: R36L, A54V, V211M, A213T, M220I and 5 SNVs. Transduction with empty vector (Ctrl) and WT hCD81 constructs served as negative and positive controls, respectively. First, we assessed the CD81 expression in whole cell lysates by immunoblotting using anti-CD81 antibody. As expected, Lunet N#3 cells and cells transduced with empty vector did not show any band corresponding to CD81. Conversely, cells transduced with WT CD81 and all hCD81 variants showed a band at 26 kDa, the molecular weight (MW) of CD81. Additional bands at lower MW were detected in WT CD81 and all variants, which correspond to degradation products or splice variants of CD81 since they were not present in Lunet N#3 cells and cells transduced with empty vector (Fig. 2a) . Next, we determined the cell-surface expression of hCD81 in single-cell suspensions by flow cytometry using an anti-hCD81-APC antibody. As expected, Lunet N#3 cells transduced with empty vector do not express detectable levels of hCD81 on the cell surface. WT hCD81 and all the hCD81 variants were expressed on the cell surface at a comparable level as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Fig. 2b, Fig. S1a ), thereby confirming trafficking of hCD81 to the plasma membrane. Additionally, each of the cell lines showed a transduction efficiency higher than 98% (Fig. S1b) . Finally, we studied the subcellular distribution of the hCD81 variants by immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal microscopy. To that end, we fixed cells, permeabilized and stained them with anti-hCD81 antibody. We stained the nuclei with DAPI. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that all hCD81 variants and WT hCD81 displayed similar staining patterns with intracellular localization as well as plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3 ).",

As a positive control, we used pseudoparticles bearing the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). Pseudoparticles with no envelope glycoproteins (noEnv) served as a negative control. All pseudoparticles encoded a Firefly reporter gene to allow the quantification of infected cells by measuring Firefly luciferase (FLuc) activity in relative light units (RLU) per well. As expected, VSV-G pseudoparticles efficiently infected every cell line. To compare the susceptibility of the different cell types to HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), we normalized the HCVpp infection to that of VSVpp (Fig. 4) . Cells without CD81 (Ctrl) showed an HCVpp infectivity of 8% relative to VSV and represented the background infectivity level. Similarly, the pseudoparticles with no envelope proteins (negative control) showed an infectivity of less than 7% relative to VSV in all the cases confirming this background level. The WT CD81 and all hCD81 variant-expressing cells similarly supported HCVpp Fig. 1 Non-synonymous variants of hCD81 analyzed in this study. a SNP database ID number, caused missense mutation and topological position (SEL: small extracellular loop; TM4: transmembrane domain 4) of affected amino acid are listed for the analyzed variants; n.d. not previously determined. b Schematic representation of hCD81 with the respective localization of amino acid substitutions due to the five non-synonymous SNVs highlighted (illustration created using biorender.com). c, d Structure of WT hCD81 according to PDB ID: 5TCX and e modelling of the five SNVs constructs.

As expected, the CD81 F186A mutant, which fails to bind HCV E2, did not render cells HCVpp susceptible (Fig. 4b) .

To that end, we infected hCD81 variant-expressing cells with seven inter-genotypic HCV chimeras: Con1/1b/R2a, J4/1b/R2a, JcR2a, J8/2b/R2a, S52/3a/R2a, ED43/4a/R2a and SA13/5a/R2a. These chimeric viruses encode the structural proteins of genotypes 1 through 5 allowing the study of genotype-specific infection events [34, 35] . The complete panel of viruses encoded a Renilla luciferase reporter gene. We thus determined HCV infectivity at 72 h post-infection by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. Measurement windows were comparable for all seven HCVcc strains (Fig.  S2a) . We plotted HCVcc infection of the different cell lines normalized to the infection of the cell line expressing WT hCD81. As expected, cells without hCD81 (Ctrl) displayed background luciferase activity after HCVcc infection with every tested genotype including a H77 (GT 1a) strain, which expressed a Gaussia luciferase reporter gene (Fig. S2b) . Similarly, and in accordance to the HCVpp assay, cells expressing the E2 binding-deficient F186A hCD81 mutant showed reduced infection with all seven Renilla genotypes tested. For the genotype 3a-S52 and 4a-ED43 chimeras, the infectivity was as low as in the control cells. Of the novel hCD81 variants tested, the variants R36L and A213T conferred similar susceptibility to Lunet N#3 cells as WT hCD81 to every genotype tested. In contrast, variants A54V, V211M and M220I conferred reduced susceptibility to HCV. The A54V variant showed a twofold reduced ability to support HCVcc infection compared to WT hCD81 when the cells were challenged with the genotype 2a and 5a chimeric viruses. Cells expressing the V211M variant supported HCVcc infection three-, two-and twofold less efficiently than WT hCD81 for genotype 2a-Jc1, 2b-J8 and 3a-S52 chimeric viruses, respectively. Variant M220I showed the strongest impairment in HCVcc infection. Infection with five inter-genotypic chimeras (2a-Jc1, 2b-J8, 3a-S52, 4a-ED43 and 5a-SA13) was significantly lower than the WT hCD81 showing 3-, 2.5-, 4-, 4-and 2.5-fold reduction, respectively. Finally, 5 SNVexpressing cells showed two-, two-and threefold reduction WT hCD81 and lacking hCD81 served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).

While all the genotypes consistently display large hydrophobic aromatic amino acids in the four critical hCD81-binding regions, the hCD81 SNV-sensitive genotypes harbour an amino acid variation at position 444 in E2 region 4.

            "text": "While the LEL of CD81 mediates HCV E2 binding [5] , the function of the CD81 domains outside the LEL backbone in the HCV entry is less well characterized. Banse et al., demonstrated using chimeric CD81 that the backbone domains play a role during the post-binding steps, being critical for productive HCV entry [26] . The specific residues in the backbone that are important for HCV uptake remain poorly understood although a cholesterol-coordinating residue (E219) seems important [26, 43] . In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of five non-synonymous SNVs, specifically R36L, A54V, V211M, A213T and M220I, on HCV infectivity. In addition, we included a CD81 construct, which harbours all five SNVs. The selected SNVs result in amino acid changes in the SEL (R36L and A54V) and in the TM4 domain (V211M, A213T and M220I) of hCD81. We used Lunet N#3 cells, which have undetectable levels of endogenous CD81 [28] , to generate new cell lines expressing six different hCD81 variants. Afterwards, we examined the expression of the variants and their functionality as HCV receptor. By LEL-directed antibody staining, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we observed that all hCD81 variants are expressed at the cell surface to comparable levels. Moreover, as we used a conformation-sensitive antibody, our results suggest that the LEL is properly folded. Further binding assays with a soluble HCV E2 glycoprotein on Chinese Hamster Ovary 745 cells (CHO745) [44] expressing the hCD81 variants could be performed to confirm proper folding of the virus-binding ectodomain. Regarding the functionality of the hCD81 variants as HCV entry factors, we demonstrated that all variants similarly support entry of HCVpp with glycoproteins of genotype 1a (H77). Nevertheless, three of the five tested variants, namely A54V, V211M and M220I, are less susceptible to infection with HCVcc genotypes 2, 3, 4 and 5 in comparison to WT CD81expressing cells.",

However, this technique has some limitations with regard to the particle architecture, binding to serum lipoproteins and capsid origin. The lentiviral particles are bigger in size (100 nm vs 60 nm) and display a lower density of E1/E2 dimers in comparison to serum-derived HCV particles [45] . These differences in the architecture of lentiviral particles compared to HCV particles may lead to differences in endocytosis and fusion processes. For instance, we identified three CD81associated proteins, CAPN5, CBLB and SRFBP1, which are required for HCV entry. CAPN5 and CBLB are involved in endocytosis whereas SRFBP1 is required in an endocytosisindependent post-binding step of HCV entry. These proteins are exclusively host factors for HCVcc, but not HCVpp [24, 25] . Common features of HCVcc and HCVpp uptake are the use of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery [8, 46] . This also holds true for HCVcc entry into 3D organoid cultures [47] . Moreover, unlike serum-derived and cell culture-derived HCV particles, lentiviral particles cannot bind to serum lipoproteins. This limits the mimicry of HCVpp cell-surface attachment via LDL-R and SCARB1, and may affect lipid-transfer functions necessary for productive HCV entry [48, 49] . Finally, this system does not allow the study of HCV uncoating since HCVpp comprises a lentiviral capsid [45] .",

Further studies, including pseudoparticles expressing glycoproteins from other HCV genotypes, will help to determine if hCD81 variants affect HCV binding in a genotypedependent manner. Grove et al. showed an excellent agreement between their J6 HCVpp and J6/JFH HCVcc assays when comparing single-and double-amino acid exchange mutants, which affect the conformation of CD81 [43] . In our HCVpp assay, the entry step was not affected by the different hCD81 variants, which is in contrast to the results from our HCVcc assay. It remains to be shown if the discrepancy observed between HCVpp and HCVcc is attributed to the different genotypes used or due to the differences in the entry process of lentiviral pseudotypes, and cell culture-produced HCV. Interestingly, the hCD81 variant-sensitive E2 proteins from genotypes 2, 3, 4, and 5 harbour an additional polar amino acid in one of the four hCD81-binding regions. This may suggest that these E2 proteins have a reduced hydrophobic-binding patch and less efficiently engage hCD81. If hCD81 backbone variants alter the hCD81 ectodomain conformation, differential binding efficiencies of the specific HCV genotypes other than genotype 1 could occur. In summary, we conclude that the tested hCD81 SNVs do not affect HCV GT1a E2 binding to hCD81, which is reliably mimicked by the HCVpp system.",

            "text": "To analyze the effect of the hCD81 SNVs on HCV entry steps beyond E2 binding, we performed HCVcc infection assays. HCV is classified into seven distinct genotypes which are differentially distributed globally [50] . HCV genotypes differ considerably in their glycoprotein sequences with a divergence between 30 and 35% at the nucleotide level [51] . This divergence leads to qualitative and quantitative differences in virus-receptor interactions and viral neutralization capacities by antibodies [52, 53] . In our study, we included five different HCV genotypes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) and subtypes to elucidate if hCD81 variants affect the authentic HCV infection in a genotype-specific manner. We used inter-genotypic chimeric viruses [34, 54] . The chimeric viruses encode structural proteins (Core, E1, E2), NS2 and p7 specific for the respective genotype, and the replication complex from a genotype 2a JFH-1 isolate (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [34, 35] . Thus, the observed genotype-specific differences are attributed to the structural proteins and not the viral replication machinery. We show that hCD81 variants A54V, V211M and M220I rendered the cells between two and fourfold less susceptible to HCV infection for specific viral genotypes, such as 2, 3, 4 and 5, compared to WT hCD81-expressing cells. In contrast, no significant protection against HCV infection was conferred by R36L and A213T amino acid substitutions. Zimmerman et al. recently demonstrated that conformational changes, i.e. opening of EC2, upon binding of cholesterol to the transmembrane domain are crucial to hCD81 function [27] . Interestingly, variants V211M and M220I are located in TM4, next to the cholesterol-binding pocket, whereas A213 in TM4 is facing the lipid bilayer and not involved in cholesterol interactions (Fig. 1) . By depleting cholesterol using M\u03b2CD, we demonstrated that WT hCD81 and variants V211M and M220I require cholesterol to the same extent to function as HCV entry factors (Fig. S3) . Thus, the amino acid changes at position V211 and M220 seem not to affect the cholesterol coordination by hCD81, which is required for HCV infection [26] . We speculate that A54V may alter cholesterol-dependent dynamics of extracellular EC2, but definite conclusions on structure-function relationships of these mutants await further research. Interestingly, variant V211M was studied before and shown to support HCVcc entry similar to WT hCD81 [21] . This discrepancy could be explained by the differences in the methodological procedure. Deest et al. infected Lunet N4 cells with F-Luc Jc1 virus for 5 h, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h later. Despite studying the same genotype (2a), we infected Lunet N#3 cells with R-Luc JcR2a virus for 4 h and the luciferase activity was determined 72 h later. Possibly, our readout system was more sensitive to detect the threefold differences in the entry efficiency. Notably, we observed reduced HCVcc infectivity in the variant V211M compared to WT hCD81 for three of the seven genotypes tested.",

In the immune cells, CD81 is involved in cell adhesion, motility, activation, proliferation, differentiation and signal transduction [14] . To confirm that the reduction in HCV susceptibility observed in HCVcc experiments was due to the receptor function of hCD81 variants and not general impairment in morphology or cell growth, it would be important to perform infection assays with hCD81-independent enveloped viruses, such as VSV and human coronavirus. However, as we neither observed differences in susceptibility to HCVpp nor in the susceptibility to the HCVcc genotype 1b, our data strongly suggest that the observed differences in HCV susceptibility are attributed to a differential entry-factor function of the respective hCD81 SNVs and not unspecific effects on cellular functions.",

To uncouple the entry from the translation and replication step, we performed subgenomic replicon assays. Translation and replication of the tested luciferase reporter replicons were comparable in all tested cells lines.

We, therefore, hypothesize that a post-binding step could be affected by hCD81 variants. CD81 interacts with several host proteins after HCV-LEL binding [23, 24, 56, 57] , and these interactions are important for the productive HCV uptake. Coimmunoprecipitation assays, comparing protein interactions of WT and variant hCD81, will help to elucidate if the identified hCD81 variants alter important protein-protein interactions, thereby expanding the knowledge about the hCD81 backbone function.",

Such studies will allow us to determine if the results obtained in vitro are also observed in vivo in the population. In a previous study, variants of SR-BI were shown to affect HCV viral load in patients [13] . Investigation of SNPs may help predict individual susceptibility, disease progression and/or response to antiviral treatment. The SNVs investigated in this study have very low frequency in the human population. The Genome Aggregation Database reported frequencies of 0.0004% for R36L, 0.003% for A54V, 0.01% for V211M, 0.002% for A213T and 0.0004% for M220I in the human population. Therefore, we decided to first perform the in vitro studies to evaluate if searching for those rare individuals with a specific SNV in HCV cohorts will provide important information. After identifying three hCD81 SNVs with an impact on GT2 infection, we consider to genotype the three SNVs in GT2 patient cohorts and in highly exposed individuals, which control the HCV infection. Due to the low frequency of the SNVs, such investigation will likely not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, it may provide important data on whether hCD81 SNVs can contribute to a better control of HCV infection. Importantly, CD81 is also a host factor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium [16] and for influenza A virus [17] , two human pathogens affecting hundreds of millions of individuals globally [58, 59] . Whether hCD81 SNVs affect the individual susceptibility to Plasmodium or influenza virus is a possibility that we would like to test.",
