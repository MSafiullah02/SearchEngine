Remyelination has been demonstrated in a variety of experimental demyelination/mutant models Blakemore, 1973, Blakemore, 1974, Blakemore, 1975, Blakemore, 1982, Duncan et al., 1988, Gumpel et al., 1989, Herndon et al., 1977, Jeffery and Blakemore, 1995, Jeffery and Blakemore, 1997, Jeffery et al., 1999, Keirstead and Blakemore, 1999, Moore et al., 1985, Rodriguez et al., 1987, Sasaki and Ide, 1989, Yajima and Suzuki, 1979 and occurs spontaneously in naturally occurring demyelinating diseases such as MS (Prineas et al., 1993a). However, remyelination failure is more prevalent than its success when considering the spectrum of pathologies that affect the CNS. Although remyelination is usually successful in most animal models, it is often incomplete in the Theiler's model of demyelination (Murray et al., 2001). Furthermore, remyelination is less efficient in old animals than in young animals (Shields et al., 1999). The failure of remyelination is illustrated within foci of chronic demyelination within the later stages of MS (Prineas et al., 1993b). Chronic MS lesions are characterized by oligodendrocyte loss (Ozawa et al., 1994), with remyelination limited to the borders of inactive plaques (Suzuki et al., 1969).",

In addition to restoring normal impulse conduction (Utzschneider et al., 1994), remyelination may decrease axonal degeneration/transection. This is suggested by the demonstration that chronically demyelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration/transection and that axonal loss in the later stages MS contributes to clinical deterioration Bjartmar et al., 1999, De Stefano et al., 1998, Trapp et al., 1998. These findings underscore the importance of developing therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination. One approach is to activate or enhance the response of endogenous mechanisms for repair, as has been demonstrated following growth factor administration in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) demyelination model (Yao et al., 1995), or passive transfer of antiserum (Rodriguez et al., 1987) or purified immunoglobulin (Rodriguez and Lennon, 1990) from mice immunized with spinal cord homogenate into the Theiler's demyelination model (Miller and Rodriguez, 1995). An alternative approach to remyelinating areas of demyelination is the transplantation of remyelination-competent cells.",

Intracerebral injection of the J2.2v-1 strain of MHV results in acute encephalomyelitis with demyelination, followed 10\u201312 days later by an immune-mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis with hindlimb paralysis and progressive CNS destruction, including the initiation of new demyelination foci probably for the life of the mouse Fleming et al., 1987, Haring and Perlman, 2001, Lane et al., 1998, Stohlman and Hinton, 2001, Stohlman et al., 2002. This model provides an environment of ongoing demyelinating pathogenesis, and is thus distinct from gliotoxin lesions. Intraspinal transplantation of glial-committed progenitors into the MHV model of MS resulted in extensive migration of transplanted cells, robust remyelination, axonal sparing, and behavioral improvement. These results show that transplant-mediated remyelination is possible following intraspinal transplantation into an environment of ongoing pathogenesis resembling MS.",

Quantification of immunolabeled cells indicated that 85 \u00b1 10.7% (range = 64\u201396, median = 80) of the total cell population was BrdU immunoreactive following an overnight pulse (Fig. 1f), and that the differentiation protocol yielded 67.4 \u00b1 4.4% oligodendrocytes (range = 60\u201372, median = 66), 26 \u00b1 7.4% astrocytes (range = 20\u201340, median = 30) and 6.6 \u00b1 6.2% other cell types (range = 1\u201313, median = 7), which included NeuN + neurons, CD11b + microglia, and other Hoechst-positive cells not identified by the immunostains tested (Fig. 1g). No difference was observed in the viability or differentiation of BrdU-labeled or -unlabeled cells.",

Area measurements of the ventral and lateral columns revealed no significant difference between animals within and between the transplanted and non-transplanted groups (P > 0.05, t test), however, a two-sample t test power analysis indicated that an experimental n of 6 per group was insufficient to conclude statistical significance of the differences between the groups.

Comparison of the total number of axons with the number of remyelinated axons for each animal within the transplanted group indicated a statistically significant correlation between these two values (r = 0.953; P < 0.05), indicating that a greater degree of axonal sparing correlated with a greater degree of remyelination.",

            "text": "To assess migration and differentiation in vivo, undifferentiated prelabeled glial-committed progenitors were transplanted into regions of demyelination in the MHV model of MS. Intracerebral injection of the J2.2v-1 strain of MHV results in initial viral replication in the ependymal cells lining the ventricles, which subsequently extends to the central canal, gray and white matter of the spinal cord. Infectious virus is usually eliminated by days 12\u201314 post infection, but is not completely cleared. Acute encephalomyelitis with myelin loss is present by day 5 and extends rapidly in the anterior funiculi. An immune-mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis with hindlimb paralysis and progressive destruction of the CNS then follows; although some remyelination takes place, the initiation of new foci of demyelination likely continues for the entire life of the mouse Fleming et al., 1987, Haring and Perlman, 2001, Lane et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2001, Stohlman and Hinton, 2001, Stohlman et al., 2002. In the current study, undifferentiated glial-committed progenitors were transplanted into the thoracic spinal cords of mice with fulminate demyelinating pathology and complete hindlimb paralysis as a result of MHV infection. Transplanted cells survived for the duration of the 21-day post-transplantation period and spread throughout the mediolateral extent of the spinal cord as well as 12 mm cranial and 10 mm caudal to the site of implantation, the extent of the tissue being examined (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that transplanted progenitor cells are capable of extensive migration throughout regions of ongoing pathogenesis. Survival and extensive migration of transplanted gliogenic cell populations has been demonstrated in the developing normal CNS (Jacque et al., 1992), myelin-deficient mutant CNS Brustle et al., 1999, Gansmuller et al., 1991, Liu et al., 2000, Tontsch et al., 1994, chemically demyelinated CNS Groves et al., 1993, Keirstead and Blakemore, 1999, and in inflamed white matter tracts in the EAE model of MS Ben-Hur et al., 2003, Pluchino et al., 2003. However, the ability of gliogenic cell populations to survive and migrate in these environments does not indicate that they will do so in the intact normal adult CNS. When glial progenitors Franklin et al., 1996, O'Leary and Blakemore, 1997 are transplanted into the intact normal adult CNS, they fail to survive or migrate; only when the cells are placed in the immediate vicinity of active regions of demyelination, where survival factors are elevated (Hinks and Franklin, 1999), do they enter the lesion. These findings suggest that the survival and extensive migration of cells in our study was due in part to the continuity of pathology throughout the region of migration.",

Chronic demyelination is a probable cause of such axonal loss (Bjartmar and Trapp, 2001). To determine whether remyelination was associated with axonal sparing in the current study, total axon numbers were determined within the ventral and lateral columns of transplanted and non-transplanted animal groups 33 days after induction of disease. Although the area of the ventral and lateral columns were not significantly different between the transplanted and non-transplanted groups (P > 0.05, t test), the total number of axons within the ventral and lateral columns of transplanted remyelinated animals was approximately 2\u00d7 the number of axons within the ventral and lateral columns of non-transplanted animals (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, comparison of the total number of axons with the number of remyelinated axons for each animal within the transplanted group indicated a statistically significant correlation between these two values (r = 0.953). These findings suggest that a greater degree of axonal sparing correlated with a greater degree of remyelination. Reduced axonal loss has also been shown after intravenous or intrathecal neurosphere transplantation in the EAE mouse model of MS (Pluchino et al., 2003). These data support the view that chronic demyelination is a cause of axonal loss, and suggest that transplant-mediated remyelination protects axons from degeneration/transection. Further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying demyelination-associated axonal degeneration/transection.",

Non-transplanted animals remained completely paralyzed throughout this time period (Fig. 6). In regions of experimental demyelination induced by lysolecithin Smith et al., 1979, Smith et al., 1981, Yezierski et al., 1992 or ethidium bromide (Felts and Smith, 1992), return of secure axonal conduction occurs at the same time as spontaneous remyelination and transplanted glial cells have been shown to improve conduction velocity to near-normal values in myelin-deficient rats (Utzschneider et al., 1994) and ethidium bromide lesions (Honmou et al., 1996). Transplantation of clonal neural cells into the intracerebroventricular system of the shiverer mice at birth resulted in myelination of up to 52% of host neuronal processes and reduced the symptomatic tremor in some animals (Yandava et al., 1999). Thus, it is intriguing that the time course of behavioral improvement following transplantation in the current study approximates the time required for remyelination Pender et al., 1989, Smith et al., 1981.",

Transplant-mediated remyelination has been demonstrated in regions of the CNS subjected to experimental demyelination or in myelin mutants, environments that are characterized by a clear cellular deficit, a largely non-reactive CNS environment, and a lack of inflammation. Thus, transplantation of embryonic stem cell-derived precursors (Brustle et al., 1999) or oligodendrocyte progenitors (Zhang et al., 1999) into postnatal myelin-deficient rats resulted in differentiation of transplanted cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Multipotential PSA-NCAM + neural precursors isolated from the postnatal rat brain have been shown to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and astrocytes following transplantation, to completely remyelinate regions of acute demyelination in the adult rat induced by ethidium bromide injection into x-irradiated dorsal column white matter (Keirstead et al., 1999). Similarly, transplantation of embryonic stem cells into regions of ethidium bromide induced demyelination in the adult rat spinal cord or into myelin-deficient shiverer mutant mice, resulted in the generation of stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes that were capable of myelinating axons (Liu et al., 2000). More recently, transplant-mediated remyelination has been illustrated in the EAE model of MS, following intravenous or intrathecal injection of adult neural precursor cells (Pluchino et al., 2003). Our findings confirm and extend those outlined above, in demonstrating that intraspinal transplant-mediated remyelination can occur in the fulminate neurodegenerative environment of the MHV model of MS and is associated with locomotor improvement.",

            "text": "The ability of glial cell preparations to remyelinate in such models does not necessarily indicate that their transplantation into demyelinated lesions in clinical disease will be successful (Stangel, 2002). Firstly, transplanted cells may be subject to the same demyelinating process that led to the development of the initial pathology. Notably, the viral \u2018trigger\u2019 of pathology in the MHV model of MS is largely cleared by 12 days post-infection Lane et al., 1998, Stohlman and Hinton, 2001, before the time of implantation in the current study. Secondly, the inability of glial progenitors to migrate through normal tissue (O'Leary and Blakemore, 1997) renders them less than ideal for remyelinating disparate foci of demyelination as seen in clinical disease (Prineas et al., 1993a). Thirdly, human transplantation necessitates a human progenitor or stem cell population that is capable of amplification and is myelinogenic. Although robust amplification of human embryonic stem cells has been achieved Carpenter et al., 2001, Reubinoff et al., 2001, the conditions needed to differentiate them into a remyelination-competent transplant population have not yet been defined. And fourthly, the gliotic environment of clinical lesions, which may contribute to the failure of endogenous remyelination, may prohibit the transplant population from effecting repair. Clearly, several key issues must be addressed before a cellular replacement strategy can be considered for the treatment of human demyelinating pathologies such as MS.",
