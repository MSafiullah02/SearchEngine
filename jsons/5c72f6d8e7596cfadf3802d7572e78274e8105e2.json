            "text": "The commercial launch of 6G communications systems and United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are both targeted for 2030. 6G communications is expected to boost global growth and productivity, create new business models and transform many aspects of society. The UN SDGs are a way of framing opportunities and challenges of a desirable future world and cover topics as broad as ending poverty, gender equality, climate change and smart cities. The relationship between these potentially mutually reinforcing forces is currently under-defined. Building on the vision for 6G, a review of megatrends, on-going activities on the relation of mobile communications to the UN SDGs and existing indicators, a novel linkage between 6G and the UN SDGs is proposed via indicators. The white paper has also launched the work of deriving new 6G related indicators to guide the research of 6G systems. The novel linkage is built on the envisaged three-fold role of 6G as 1) a provider of services to help steer and support communities and countries towards reaching the UN SDGs', 2) an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help reporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and 3) a reinforcer of new ecosystems based on 6G technology enablers and 6G network of networks to be developed in line with the UN SDGs that incorporates future mobile communication technologies available in 2030. Related challenges are also identified. An action plan is presented along with prioritized focus areas within the mobile communication sector technology and industry evolution to best support the achievement of the UN SDGs.",

            "text": "The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) were introduced in 2015. There are 17 goals included in the Agenda 2030. The agenda itself together with the targets and the indicators forms the action plan for achieving the goals. The goals are framed to address global challenges including climate change, poverty and inequalities [UN 2015] . The UN SDGs also provide a high-level guide as to how governments and companies should plan their future strategies when striving for sustainable ways to live, produce and consume. This 6G White Paper looks at how 6G research and development are connected to the UN SDGs. In the Visionchapter, the operational environment of 6G is defined. The starting point is that 6G will open a new era of 'Internet of Intelligence' with connected people, things and intelligence. The UN SDGs are a response to global megatrends which will also affect 6G research and development. In the Megatrends-chapter, the trends for sustainable development of 6G are identified and the effects of these trends are examined. The fourth chapter begins with an outline of prior work which has mapped the linkage between the UN SDGs and ICT or mobile communications industries. The chapter presents a renewed linkage between 6G and the UN SDGs, as well as identifying relevant indicators. Chapter five identifies technical, regulatory and businessrelated challenges and obstacles. An action plan is presented to guide the development of 6G and support the linkage between 6G and UN SDGs. Finally, concluding remarks present a set of research questions.",

The six critical cross-cutting factors should be considered when addressing any of the goals, because it is argued that the goals can only be achieved by a comprehensive approach (See Fig. 1-1) . It is important to keep in mind that the advancement of one goal may advance other goals but may also have adverse effects on others. When considering 6G and mobile communications technology and its development, it is important to keep in mind that the developed technology itself should be sustainable and used in a sustainable way. The mobile communications community must pay attention to matters such as overall energy consumption, use of non-toxic materials, environmentally friendly base stations (including locating them where they do not adversely impact the environment), and sustainable supply chains. While not all adverse interactions between goals can be avoided, the trade-offs that are made should be openly addressed and mitigated . This is where the entry points offer useful tools so that adverse interactions between the goals are minimized. Besides technology, 6G has a clear potential to directly contribute to the UN SDGs by addressing digital inclusion and societal empowerment. For example, placing a base station in a remote area may advance the quality of life and work opportunities in peri-urban or remote locations, but have negative effects on the surrounding wildlife. The entry points offer a more a holistic approach to avoid such adverse interactions between the goals and have proved to be useful when examining how 6G can help achieve the UN SDGs (see Chapter 4).",

However, in our 6G Vision some building blocks exist already or are part of the 5G evolutionary journey to 2030. Possible examples are context awareness and situational reasoning. It should be noted that all those focus areas embrace not only technical characteristics, but their potential should be understood in the wider context of transformational services, new ecosystems and value chains. Exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing use cases that have the greatest potential to improve the lives of people around the globe could lead into rapid solutions if different stakeholders are prepared to work in unison. During the 2020 pandemic, we have seen automotive companies developing emergency ventilators for critically ill patients in intensive care. Conversely, the inability to collaborate could lead to chaos, which also seems to be present at some level during the current crisis. The choices people make in their everyday lives -whether common citizens, politicians or CEOs of global companies -do matter. We as humans often forget that open collaboration is essential, even though we may disagree on views.

The 6G ecosystem will provide solutions that empower individuals and communities to adopt self-correcting processes and steer the actions towards long term sustainability. 6G will also provide the means for sufficient data collection -with strict privacy protection rules and in line with values of our civil society, corporate accountability and government transparency -to enable the monitoring of SDG indicators that are or will become relevant in the near future.

These resources can be tangible or intangible. Tangible resources include concrete physical assets, whereas intangible resources consider immaterial resources such as knowledge and energy. 6G will connect these aspects using both local and wide wireless networks to create a hyperconnected world bringing communities every closer to a globally connected world. Since the world is not homogeneous, any development to achieve the 6G vision must support an open architecture, crowd sourcing, and enablement of third-party application and service eco-system to meet local needs.

Industry encompasses various stakeholders such as mobile network operators (MNOs) and digital service providers, all investing in the infrastructure, and other telecommunication industry that develops the 6G technology and applications. Verticals include stakeholders from e.g. automotive, health, energy and other sectors that use the technologies in specific application areas. Given the challenges and economic impact of adopting the UN SDGs, various verticals need to engage earlier in the process compared to development of previous generations of mobile communications. Also special purpose 6G networks will be operated in verticals and the various applications tailored for verticals' use will be running on the 6G networks. Finally, we want to remind about the role of the users of the future systems. To prevent digital divide, people need to have the devices required to use the services and they also need to have skills to use those as well as the available services. Furthermore, people need to understand technologies and they need to learn appropriate technological skills to actively transform disruptive technologies into advancing empowerment. ",

Megatrends are change-related phenomena and transformative, global forces that define the future world. They have impact on businesses, societies, economies, cultures, and personal lives. Though the COVID-19 pandemic dominates the news, climate change is probably the most topical today, but phenomena including population growth and demographics, increasing environmental pollution or global competition for resources are also current megatrends [Dufva 2020]. For example, the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), as well as the Government of Norway, have pointed out the challenge of Digital Divide as one of the global challenges. The governmental report [GovNorway 2020] on \"Digital transformation and development policy\" identified the following four barriers to digitalization (i) access, (ii) regulation, (iii) digital competence and (iv) exclusion, as priorities for the government. In a similar matter, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has added \"last mile connectivity\" as the main priority for development policy. From the perspective of digitally empowering the users globally, it should be emphasized that digital inclusion is the catalyst for achieving the UN SDGs, implying that we also need to address how everyone in the society can benefit from basic information in the digital world available free on the web. Furthermore, certain UN SDGs require global cooperation to be successful leaving aside national interests, such as environment and ecological reconstruction, controlling spread of diseases.",

Its asset is embodied in humans who either go through the system (students) or work within it (teachers, researchers etc.) as human capital, resulting from diffusion and research of knowledge. Knowledge creation within this subsystem is e.g. education in different educational institutes as well as research. Economic system consists of different elements that comprise the economic structure of a community, such as institutions, industries, companies, services, banks. Its asset is economic capital, i.e. everything that makes it possible to perform economically useful work. This includes for example machinery, production processes, resources, and money. Natural environment has as its asset natural capital, i.e. nature itself and the resources it provides, such as soils, water, air, living organisms, minerals, and metals. Assets Media-based and culture-based public, a combination of the civil society and media, are information capital and social capital that are integrated and combined in the subsystem. This capital includes on the one hand, information and media related assets such as television, newspaper, and information sharing networks, and on the other hand culture related assets such as e.g. art, traditions, values, and life-styles. The political system's assets are political and legal capital. Political capital refers to the accumulation of resources and power to the politicians, parties, and other stakeholders, and legal capital is understood as the legal system and laws and regulations. [Carayannis et al. 2012] In the quintuple helix model, circulation of knowledge between the subsystems is seen to happen within a nation-state but also between states [Carayannis et al. 2012 ]. Next, we go through megatrends we have identified as relevant from sustainable development of 6G point of view. The trends largely cross the boundaries of nation-states, thus the quintuple helix model needs to be understood in different levels as well, both at the nation-state level as well crossing these boundaries.",

Thus, once the infrastructure of 6G is in place, the content growth will be in terms of supporting multiple social and technological identities of people through a variety of media. This would require a mindful view on decision making and regulation of future, data, information, media and network usage in light of sustainable growth for economy. Thus, the human in 6G worlds will be increasingly sophisticated in terms of their media and service consumption while being rooted in their local economies. Connectivity is therefore not only virtual and digital, but also physical, such that the physical world will seamlessly meet the virtual world and, with novel ways of interacting with the human biological world.

A prerequisite for this is the creation of 6G use cases that support the UN SDGs and can guide the development of the standard. Implementing the 6G technology should be affordable and not require disproportionate infrastructure investment.

Specifically, the proposed framework draws linkages to the UN SDGS by viewing 6G as: 1) a provider of services to help steer communities and countries towards reaching the SDGs', 2) an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help reporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and 3) a reinforcer of a new technological ecosystem to be developed in line with the UN SDGs.

For the most part, the lack of visible and viable opportunities, that could otherwise facilitate people and institutions steer their actions towards community betterment, cultivate meta-narratives of hate, deviance, polarisation, environmental degradation, radicalisation, conflict, terrorism, and war. For example, one can observe that across the Human Development Index (HDI), communities lacking access to good education, cannot contribute positively to the development of job and wealth creation that leads to social change and advancement. In this context, 6G technology will deliver services and solutions that will empower individuals and communities to adopt selfcorrecting processes and steer the actions towards long term sustainability.",

Today, of the 169 targets in the Agenda, OECD countries report data for only 105 6 . The White Paper Expert Group examined further the scope of this data-gap and conducted a systematic analysis of all available UN SDG indicators metadata, looking at how indicators are measured in the field 7 . The conclusions of this exhaustive exercise are twofold: (1) most indicators are currently being measured with asynchronous and anachronistic tools (questionnaires or household surveys) and are not up to par with current advances in data management and data retrieval; (2) there is a discord between the breadth of some indicators and the inefficacy of instruments to collect disaggregated data. Against this backdrop, this White Paper anticipates the instrumentation of 6G as a scientific tool for helping authorities and other stakeholders to collect data at a much more local, hyperlocal and granular level than currently conducted. The use of 6G technology as a measurement tool will not only enable the reporting of missing KPIs, and thus, reducing the data-gap, but will also enable the monitoring of new indicators that will become relevant in the near future. The expert group has identified a four-layer taxonomy comprised of cross-cutting domains that can be used for eliciting more refined indicators for the UN SDGs': Critical infrastructure, ICT/mobile network vendors, marketplaces, and application services.",

Sensors that capture and transmit data quickly over WiFi, 3G, 4G and 5G are becoming more accurate and efficient. The development of mobile networks helps data from the sensors to be collected and transmitted more efficiently faster and across larger distances. An exponentially increasing amount of data is made available from all types of geographical, economic, and social contexts, while the technologies for system and sub-system monitoring is growing in fully maturity. Thus, the instrumentation of 6G technology for monitoring of KPI's is expected to have major improvement in increasing the sampling rate, improving the veracity and variety of the measured data, reduce costs. Communication infrastructure (mobile networks) can be used as a sensor and as innovative tool to monitor sustainability and efficiency in many different forms and contexts. For example, in the developed world, the penetration of home IoT devices can be treated as a sign of prosperity and well-being, enabling governments to identify those neighbourhood blocks that require more support than others. Respectively, indicators like volume of streaming content, data consumption, and data production can all lead to better hyperlocal KPIs which can be monitored, reported and addressed by stakeholders in near real-time.",

At the individual level, the envisioned services that will be derived by the 6G wireless systems will call for a new bottom-up mandate of social relations and conduct. For example, hyperlocal monitoring of energy consumption and CO2 footprint can work as a reinforcing feedback loop leading to individual self-adjustment. For example, new services will provide individuals and communities with access to KPIs on their personal energy footprint. The impact of 6G will also be relatively greater in the domain of governance, public administration, and through institutions (e.g. 6G Hospitals, 6G Schools, Industry 4.0, e-government). The interconnection between people, communities, and institutions along with the increasing use of heterogenous data streams in the area of public policy decision-making, is set to reconfigure how people, governments and the industry will be governed in the future. For example, it has often been recognised that the role of 6G as an enabling technology needs to be developed in accordance with the relevant UN SDGs including, but not limited to the new governance paradigm on energy efficiency, recycled materials, non-toxic leakage, inclusiveness, partnerships, privacy/security, and democracy. Thus, high-end novel technology solutions enabled by 6G such as telepresence and mixed reality, accurate positioning, wearable displays, mobile robots and drones, specialized processors, and next-generation wireless networks will raise new questions with regards to law, privacy, values, corporate accountability and government transparency. The first 6G White Paper [6G Flagship 2019] outlined that the current smart phones are likely to be replaced by pervasive XR experiences with lightweight glasses delivering unprecedented resolution, frame rates, and dynamic range. But at the same time, we must ensure that 6G is developed keeping mind the UN SDGs for example to work towards maximum coverage/connectivity also in the rural areas.",

The expert group used the developed three-tier analytical framework of 6G when examining the linkages between individual targets and their indicators. First a set of goals was selected based on the input of the expert group, then the targets for these goals were examined together with the matching UN indicators, and finally a framework of how 6G can either 1) provide services to help steer communities and countries towards reaching the SDGs, 2) enable measuring for data collection to help reporting of indicators, and 3) reinforce a new technological ecosystem to be developed in line with the UN SDGs. When doing this, the cross-cutting issues (entry points for transformation) as suggested by the UN Global Sustainable Development Report [UN 2019b] were considered: Human well-being and capabilities, Sustainable and just economies, Food systems and nutrition patterns, Energy decarbonization with universal access, Urban and peri-urban development and Global environmental commons which are summarized in Fig. 1-1.

This means that statistical indicators of well-being and genuine development will take on a more important role 8 . Based on our work it seems that the proposed indicators for 6G already reflect this vision: most indicators suggested measure the services 6G can provide to enhance human well-being. Table 4 -5 presents the new 6G related indicators developed within the Expert Group per entry points. The entry points were used in the classification of indicators because they are cross-cutting for all 17 goals and offer a more holistic view. The entry points are described in more detail in [UN 2019b, pp. 163-71] and summarized in the table. Looking at the indicators through the entry points also ensures the creation of a framework where no individual goal is being overly advanced at the cost of another. Having indicators for different entry points allows us to set target values that tackle more than just one goal at a time. We present indicators that can be measured in numbers but there are many fundamental issues such as the availability of a certain 6G enabled service or the coverage that can be measured by simply answering yes/no.

The advanced capabilities of 6G will benefit from a fiber backhaul that connects the distributed radio network to the core network. The challenge is that even leading economies have a relatively low fiber penetration, because of underinvestment in pure fiber networks. 6G will likely combine a range of radio access network technologies from macro cells to small cells with very high capacity short-range links, the latter offering denser coverage than 5G and increased capacity and quality of service. Small cell network architectures will be deployed to first and foremost to urban centers and indoors where the natural demand for high bandwidth capacity and low latency is at the highest. Dense small cell deployments have usually been hindered by various factors including regulatory barriers and inconsistent local approval processes 9 .

Rather than planning and deploying the same network solution in the rural and underconnected regions as in the urban metropolitan areas, they ought to employ a more flexible approach to network design customized for different rural and suburban section of the population, such as the terrain, availability of power grid, demographics and capacity to absorb the digital technologies. Some examples are the use of shared spectrum, edge computing/caching, renewable energy, and crowd sourcing to build a more cost-effective network architecture. Partnering with the government, industry and local community would ensure that everybody's expectations are met in a sustainable, secured and trustworthy manner. An ecosystem of local operators to complement existing MNOs needs to flourish to enable scale and faster time to deployment with equitable revenue sharing models.",

The manufacturers should cost-optimize these network elements for low-density sparse service area rather than strip down the equipment designed for urban metropolitan users. To keep the capital cost of network equipment down, there would probably need to be a better cost sharing between manufacturer and the service provider such that the equipment is paid over a period of time than upfront. There could possibly be innovation in business model as well where revenue is shared between the two. Application and service providers -6G will enable a new set of applications and services that are based on 6G networks' ability to merge communication service with e.g. accurate position service and high-resolution imaging service. For the various users of 6G in developed and developing worlds, the UIs need to be more user friendly, with audio/video-based interaction, automatic language translation and minimizing text-based (involving read-write) input-output, primarily for those who are not literate. Solution to authentication and security must be simplified to match the digital capacity of the users, especially in the developing world.",

Adopting the national and international level agreements for inherent changes that need to take place to meet the UN SDGs places significant economical constraints on the verticals. To transform operations to meet the UN SDGs, the verticals will need to take all from the future technologies can offer. Therefore, verticals need to engage early on in the process of 6G development and not wait for the telecommunications industry to define what 6G can bring for verticals. Also, special purpose 6G networks will be operated in the verticals and the various applications tailored for verticals' use will be running on the 6G networks. Therefore, the vertical could take an active role in 6G.",

Another good example is emerging in the power industry with micro-grids, which ought to be looked into in the telecom industry. Freemium models and free access to internet for basic content (i.e., non-video content) would help accelerate subscriber base among the digitally disadvantaged. Free internet in areas of extreme poverty would increase the possibility of education and business opportunities for people without means. Use of cloud, block chain, edge computing and AI should be leveraged to bring about a complete transformation in the mobile industry where it is democratized with some control given to the users. At the present time, the industry, i.e., the mobile service providers have a monopolistic control on the subscriber base. This has been broken to some extent with the broadband mobile internet due to net-neutrality. But, still this has a long way to go when it comes to network infrastructure deployment and revenue sharing.",

This has turned out to be a complex task as the UN SDG framework comprehensively considers societal challenges and the development of 6G is still at an early stage. However, the role of telecommunications is inevitable in aiming to meet the UN SDGs. To bridge the gap, the role of 6G is here proposed to be seen to consist of three distinct viewpoints: 6G as 1) a provider of services to help steer communities and countries towards reaching the UN SDGs', 2) an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help reporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and 3) a reinforcer of a new 6G ecosystem to be developed in line with the UN SDGs. By looking into where 6G can impact the indicators defined in the UN SDG framework from these viewpoints, we have outlined connections between 6G and the UN SDGs. This white paper has also started to derive a new set of indicators for 6G which are not yet included in the UN SDG framework or in the development of prior generations of mobile communication networks. A number of research questions for the future remains to be explored including the following:",
