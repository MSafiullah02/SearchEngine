Such products are then applied in agriculture, medicine, and industrial biotechnology [3\u20136]. Insect biotechnology has proven to be a useful resource in diverse industries, especially for the production of industrial enzymes, microbial insecticides, insect genes, and many other substances. Insect cells (ICs), and particularly lepidopteran cells, constitute a competitive strategy to mammalian cells for the manufacturing of biotechnology products. Among the wide range of methods and expression hosts available for the production of biotech products, ICs are ideal for the production of complex proteins requiring extensive posttranslational modification.",

            "text": "The development of the field was driven by the importance of insects in all fields of human endeavor. Insects are the most diverse of all groups of organisms, with more species than any other. The number of extant species is estimated at about 1.9 \u00d7 106 and potentially represents over 90 % of the various animal life forms on Earth [7]. They have overwhelming impact on agriculture and public health. Insect biotechnology uses biotechnological methods on insects (or their cells) to develop products or services. These new substances have applications in medicine, the sustainable protection of plants, and industrial biotechnology. This means that insect biotechnology employs the general principles of biotechnology. More specifically, insect biotechnology borrows from and is driven by scientific breakthroughs in molecular biology, particularly by the development of tools and techniques that allow genetic characterization and engineering of organisms and cells as with recombinant DNA technology and plant protoplast fusion. Recently, bacteria have been engineered to carry and express silk genes from the mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori, and used in the production of synthetic silk, the natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles [8] (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-24244-6_10). As a basic research tool, the strategies of insect biotechnology include the sequencing and annotation of insect genomes as well as analyses using comparative genomics. Insect biotechnological applications to pest management include the development of resistant crops and trees that express insect-specific toxins, the design of microbial agents with enhanced insecticidal potency, and the engineering of insects that can transfer lethal genes to natural populations following their mass release in the field. Comparative genomics analyses also make it possible to identify insect-specific genes that can be targeted for rational insecticide design.",

            "text": "\nB. thuringiensis (Bt) kurstaki has served as a microbial insecticide for many decades, but the widespread use was limited by its instability when exposed to UV radiation under sunlight and its poor retention on plant surfaces in wet weather. The high toxicity of the Bt toxins to a variety of insect pests, and the ease with which the gene could be isolated from bacterial plasmids, made it an obvious choice for the development of the first insect-resistant transgenic plants. The active Bt toxin binds to a receptor in cells lining the insect midgut and creates a channel, allowing free passage of ions. The cells lining the midgut die, and very soon, the insect dies, too. Different strains of Bt contain plasmids encoding different toxins with different specificities of action against insects. A particular toxin is generally effective against only a limited range of closely related species. Bt toxins are used in a variety of transgenic crops, including cotton, for protection against a variety of lepidopteran pests; corn (maize), for protection against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera); and potatoes, for protection against the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Intensive screening programs have led to important collections of Bt strain isolates in the last few decades [13\u201318]. This became necessary as reports of the appearance of insect resistance and novel Cry proteins with toxic potential against different organisms emerged together with the need for more potent toxins with specificity for a much broader range of pests. The biosafety and mechanism of Bt toxin action are reviewed elsewhere [19\u201322].",

            "text": "In 1999, Bulet and colleagues reviewed the arsenal of agents used by insects to fight off invading microorganisms [45]. They reported that it is essentially based on short cationic antibacterial and antifungal peptides/polypeptides (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-24244-6_6). Depending on the species, insect adipose tissue can respond to bacterial infection by the synthesis of a large array of antimicrobial substances (e.g., Drosophila adults produce more than ten different molecules, including drosocin, drosomycin, defensin, metchnikowins, diptericin, and cecropins) or by producing relatively few molecules (e.g., a single peptide, defensin, in the dragonfly, Aeshna cyanea) [46]. Antimicrobial peptides produced by insects are structurally similar to those produced by many plants and animals. Industry has capitalized on that feature for the development of many new drugs from insects. For example, cecropins [47] have similarities with the amphibian \u03b1-helical antimicrobial peptides, magainins, found in frog skin secretions, while drosomycin from Drosophila and thanatin from the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris, have similarities with plant defensins and frog skin secretion antimicrobial peptides, respectively. Bulet and colleagues [48] concluded that insect antimicrobial peptides are useful in overcoming the problem of acquired bacterial drug resistance and of the emergence of opportunistic pathogens, especially in immunosuppressed hosts due to the fact that:They rapidly kill target microorganisms.They have broad activity spectra.They are not active against mammalian cells.They have a mode of action that should restrict the selection of resistant strains.\n",

            "text": "Perhaps one of the areas in which insect biotechnology has made the greatest contribution to basic research is the development of insect cell cultures. In general, the establishment of cell cultures (animals, plants, insects, and fungi) is done by growing cells under conditions suitable for propagating stable, likely clonal, lines of cells harvested from embryos, specific tissues, or whole organisms in a variety of culture media developed for the species under investigation as described in Sect. 5. The justification for this is that it is easier to do experiments on individual cells than in animals, considering that the cell is the basic unit of life. It is also easier to produce large quantities of metabolites, especially heterologous proteins, from cell cultures than from animals. ICs are also excellent systems for the production and posttranslational modification of large quantities of modified eukaryotic proteins in a short time.",

            "text": "The critical issues that must be considered for the successful establishment and maintenance of insect cell cultures [49, 50] are as follows:The use of actively growing cells (i.e., cells in exponential growth phase) to start the culture. Cells such as the Sf9 and Sf21 may be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. A temperature of 27\u201328 \u00b0C is optimal for growing these cells. Starter media such as TC-100 medium (Sigma, Cat# T3160) supplemented with heat inactivated 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) double in 20\u201324 h and do not require CO2. Mammalian sera contain complement which mediates quick inactivation of baculoviruses (BVs). It is important to start cells from a frozen cell stock to avoid contamination. High-quality insect cells are crucial for the success of BV expression. Clumping could be a problem and should be avoided. Avoiding media particles could help reduce clumping, and gentle shaking in shake flasks could help dislodge them.The importance of medium quality cannot be overemphasized. Synthetic serum-free media are available from Invitrogen and other suppliers and are hassle-free. Certain media can be preferred for certain applications. For example, synthetic serum-free media are strongly recommended for the expression of secreted proteins but can be also used for non-secreted protein studies and for transfections.Transition from serum-containing to synthetic serum-free medium (weaning) is done gradually on healthy cells growing in log phase. It is done by slowly decreasing the percentage of serum-containing medium and increasing the percentage of synthetic serum-free medium in the cell culture over a period of about a week.Antibiotics may be used to control contamination. An example is penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen SKU# 15070\u2013063) used at 1:99 dilution. Gentamycin and nystatin can also be used routinely in insect cell culture. The use of antibiotics is optional.Insect cells such as Sf9 or Sf21 cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen for many years frozen in TC-100 or similar medium supplemented with heat inactivated 10 % FBS. When needed, frozen cells may be thawed in a carefully designed protocol to avoid damage.Cleanliness of glassware is an important requirement. Insect cells are very sensitive to contaminants, especially detergents. Flasks should be washed using ~1 % Triton X-100.\n",

Lepidopteran cell lines have been established primarily to propagate insect viruses as biopesticides for the biological control of insect pests [58]. Lately, the baculovirus expression vector system combined with insect cell cultures (IC-BEVS) has become more attractive for the expression of many heterologous proteins than those derived from bacteria, yeast, vertebrates, or viruses due to its unique characteristics. This technology is also being used for the construction of recombinant BVs to use as biopesticides, which offer comparatively faster killing of insect pests than wild-type BVs [59\u201362].",

Since Grace\u2019s medium, other media have been developed for specific uses in insect biotechnology. For example, ESF 921 medium was developed to address the need for a single medium that can support high cell growth using Sf9, Sf21, Trichoplusia ni (e.g., High FiveTM and Tn 368 cells), and Drosophila cells (e.g., S2). High levels of recombinant protein have been expressed in ESF 921 using a variety of cell lines with insect cell baculovirus expression vector system (IC-BEVS; see below) technology or the stable transformed cell technology. ESF 921 was designed to especially enhance the expression of glycosylated proteins.

BVs are usually associated with the insect arthropod orders of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Crustacea, and Acarina (mites). The virions are rod shaped, 40\u201370 nm \u00d7 250\u2013400 nm, comprising a lipoprotein envelope surrounding a protein capsid containing a DNA\u2013protein core. NPVs include those that infect the lepidopterans, Helicoverpa armigera, S. litura, S. exigua, Amsacta moorei, Agrotis ipsilon, A. segetum, Anadividia peponis, T. ni, Thysanoplusia orichalcea, Adisura atkinsoni, Plutella xylostella, Corcyra cephalonica, Mythimna separata, and Phthorimaea operculella [76]. Those that infect caterpillars of lepidopteran insects and dipteran larvae appear to have attracted the greatest attention. Each BV is highly specific in its host range, being limited to a single type of insect. The unique characteristics of BVs have enabled the development of the IC-BEVS, which has found great use in biotechnology. IC-BEVS are safe and lend themselves to abundant and rapid production of recombinant proteins in ICs. The development of the first(?) IC-BEVS is credited to MD Summers, who was granted a patent for it in 1988. The IC-BEVS has been widely used in research and scientific industrial communities for the production of high levels (up to 1000 mg/mL) of correctly posttranslationally modified (folding, disulfide bond formation, oligomerization, glycosylation, acylation, proteolytic cleavage), biologically active, and functional recombinant proteins [77]. The IC-BEVS is based on the introduction of a foreign gene into a region of the genome which is nonessential for viral replication via homologous recombination with a transfer vector containing the target gene. The resulting recombinant BV lacks one of several nonessential genes (polh, v-cath, chiA, etc.) which is replaced with a foreign gene encoding a heterologous protein which can be expressed in cultured ICs and insect larvae.",

            "text": "The pioneering studies of Hofmann [90] and Boyce [91] and their coworkers in the mid-1990s, in which they outfitted AcMNPV with an expression cassette driving a marker gene via a strong viral promoter (active in the target cells), boosted interest in BVs as potential vectors for gene therapy. A well-known and accepted economic process for this purpose is the production of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors in lepidopteran Sf9 cells using recombinant AcMNPV or other BVs [92\u201396]. BV-mediated gene transfer has already demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy studies [97\u2013100]. Gene therapy has so fully come of age so much that the high potential of this therapeutic modality can now be realized for treating several diseases, such as severe immune deficiencies [101, 102], ocular diseases [103], and cancer [104]. Several virus-derived vectors and non-virus gene transfer agents have been used to address these applications. Lentiviruses (LVs) have become widely used for gene delivery and gene therapy when sustained gene expression is required [105]. The application of BV for producing AAV and LV facilitates the development of the gene therapy field from the bioprocess perspective. Currently, BV transduction has been used to generate stem cells carrying therapeutic payloads of interest suitable for cartilage and bone tissue engineering and targeted glioma gene therapy [106]. Effective transduction and high-level transgene expression mediated by baculoviral vectors are especially suited for cancer gene therapy [107]. Baculoviral vectors armed with suicide genes, tumor suppressor genes, proapoptotic genes, immunopotentiating genes, and antiangiogenesis genes have been tested in vivo in animal tumor models in many different anticancer regimens [108\u2013110]. More recently, ex vivo gene therapy studies have been conducted using BVs equipped with suicide genes to transduce stem cells [112\u2013114]. This approach benefits from the tropism exhibited by many adult stem cells for primary, solid, and metastatic tumors. Kotin and coworkers have extended the versatility of the IC-BEVS to include the production of faithfully assembled and packaged rAAV vectors suitable for in vivo gene therapy applications [115].",

Given its speed of development and versatility for the expression of a wide range of protein families, the IC-BEVS offers multiple advantages for protein production in a variety of applications. Since the development of the IC-BEVS in the 1980s [117], thousands of recombinant proteins, ranging from cytosolic enzymes to membrane-bound proteins, have been successfully produced in BV-infected ICs. However, expression yields in optimized transformed fed-batch mammalian cells cultured in a bioreactor commonly reach grams of recombinant protein per L; in ICs infected by recombinant BVs, the yield rarely exceeds 50\u2013100 mg per L. This relatively low expression capacity can be compensated in the IC-BEVS by the short development times and lower costs associated with a specific product. This implies that for the production of a recombinant protein with market needs not exceeding 5\u201310 kg per year (i.e., subunit vaccines), the IC-BEVS is currently one of the best alternatives [118]. In fact, most licensed products obtained in ICs correspond to vaccines and not to products with a high production demand such as therapeutic antibodies [119]. However, the yield is not the only bottleneck of the IC-BEVS. A marked proteolysis of recombinant proteins during BV-based production is frequently encountered. This observation is due, in part, to the cytopathogenic effects of the BV vectors in ICs during infection [69, 93, 94].",

            "text": "In addition to the numerous advantages and usefulness of IC-BEVS already discussed, they have become one of the systems of choice to display vectors that would be suitable for targeting and gene transfer to mammalian cells. Display of heterologous proteins is usually carried out using mammalian viruses such as retro-, adeno-, and adeno-associated viruses [98, 85]. The main advantage of molecular display technology is the physical linkage between the proteins or peptides displayed (phenotype) and the genes that encode them (genotype). This allows simultaneous selection of the genes with proteins of the desired affinity or function [99]. Among extremely versatile display technologies are those based on the IC-BEVS. The expression of foreign proteins on the BV surface was described previously. The applicability of IC-BEVS display technology in the generation and screening of eukaryotic expression libraries has been eminently demonstrated and established [100, 101]. The first proteins chosen to be displayed were glutathione S-transferase and the external domain of gp120, a surface glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). Both were successfully expressed on the BV 25 surface as N-terminal fusions to the mature gp64 protein; additionally, gp120 was shown to be functional in binding to its ligand, CD4 [102]. Variations of the HIV-1 gp41 epitope, \u201cELDKWA,\u201d were BV-infected ICs and screened with a specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In 1997, Grabherr and colleagues demonstrated the presentation of the ectodomain of the HIV-1 gp41 envelope protein on the virus surface, either as a fusion to the entire gp64 or, alternatively, to its transmembrane domain [101, 100]. Other BEVS-based systems include:Immunization of mice with recombinant baculovirus (rBV) displaying gp64 amino-terminal fusion proteins for the nuclear receptors, liver X receptors (LXRs) and farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR). This is used to develop monoclonal antibodies to LXR and FXR. LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily. LXR activation normalizes glycemia and improves insulin sensitivity in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. FXR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It has emerged as a key player in the control of multiple metabolic pathways. On its activation by bile acids, FXR regulates bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and transport, as well as various aspects of lipid and glucose metabolism.Display of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 of rubella virus on the BV surface [103, 104].The use of BV surface display for the presentation of antigenic sites from the foot-and-mouth disease virus [104] and the p67 antigen of Theileria parva, the causative agent of the cattle disease East Coast fever [105].The use of a display strategy in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused with either the N- or C-terminus of AcMNPV major capsid protein vp39, leading to the high-level incorporation of the EGFP\u2013vp39 fusion into the BV capsid with apparent compatibility with oligomeric proteins [106, 107].\n",

Such virology research is revealing fundamentally new information on virus/host cell interactions and uncovering signal transduction pathways that are new to insect science. Research based on IC-BEVS is leading to the development of high-speed screening technologies which are essential in the search for new insect pest management tools.

This is needed to maintain the cells in exponential growth phase which is ideal for rAAV production. Small culture-volume rAAV preparations are routinely performed by either triple infection (Rep baculovirus, Cap baculovirus, and vector genome baculovirus) or double infection (Rep-Cap baculovirus plus the vector genome baculovirus). AAV vector may be harvested directly from the shake flask when cell viability decreases to <30 % by freeze\u2013thaw lysis. The cell lysate may then be nuclease-treated to reduce viscosity and digest extravirion DNA. Debris is removed by centrifugation or filtration and the rAAV is concentrated by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG, 8000 MW) to the clarified lysate (2 %, w/v) and enhancing the precipitation of the rAAV particles [70, 109, 110].",

Commercially available media include serum-free formulations from several manufacturers. As in the benchtop scale, consistently regulated temperature, agitation, and dissolved oxygen are the most critical parameters for promoting cell growth and rAAV productivity. The buffering capacity of these commercial growth media adequately maintains the acidity of the culture within levels acceptable for the growth of Sf9 cells, making pH monitoring optional. The low-MOI strategy used for heterologous protein expression in the baculovirus\u2013insect cell system has proved very useful for rAAV production [111, 112]. Negrete and colleagues [76, 77] found that using MOIs much less than 1 was effective for rAAV production if the cell density at the time of infection was appropriately adjusted to accommodate the increased time until baculovirus-induced cell cycle arrest. Initially, few cells are infected, and the probability that different viruses coinfect a cell is near zero. Thus, using a primary MOI of 0.05, the MOI of the secondary round is about 5 [113, 114].",

            "text": "Tissue engineering is the use of a combination of cells, engineering, and material methods, together with suitable biochemical and physicochemical factors, to improve or replace biological functions. While it was once categorized as a subfield of biomaterials science, having grown in scope and importance, it can be considered as a field in its own right. The term is closely associated with applications for repairing or replacing portions or whole tissues (i.e., the bone, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, skin, muscle, etc.). Great success has been achieved in the area of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells which are considered a highly potent vehicle for cell-based therapies [115] due to their differentiation potential and special immunological properties such as suppression of the host graft response. BV transduction of mammalian cells does not seem to seriously compromise their immunological status and behavior in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo [116, 117]. BVs are potentially safe candidates for therapeutic gene delivery because of their intrinsic inability to replicate in mammalian cells and their low cytotoxicity [53, 68, 118\u2013120]. Articular cartilage is a heavy tissue that protects bones, but is limited in self-repair capacity. Hu and coworkers first demonstrated that BV can effectively transduce rat articular chondrocytes [86, 121\u2013123]. However, chondrocytes tend to dedifferentiate during subculture, thus hindering their in vitro expansion and subsequent transplantation back to the host. Sung and colleagues demonstrated that transduction of dedifferentiated chondrocytes with a BV vector (Bac-CB) expressing bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) not only restores the differentiation status of passaged chondrocytes in vitro but also increases accumulation of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix [124]. These activities were further augmented by BV-mediated coexpression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 [125, 126]. Lin and colleagues recently constructed a recombinant BV (Bac-CV) expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [82, 127, 128]. Implantation of Bac-CV- and Bac-CB-transduced rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into critical-size segmental bone defects at the femora of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits accelerated and ameliorated bone healing, thanks to the in vivo coexpression of BMP-2/VEGF, ensuing improved osteogenesis and angiogenesis [129\u2013131].",

As a result of new applications of the technology in human and animal health, including biopharmaceuticals and new-generation vaccines, the IC-BEVS platform has become the technology of choice for virologists worldwide. The technology is also seamlessly suited for producing viral vectors for cell therapy and for readily expressing proteins of interest in fundamental biological research, tissue engineering, drug discovery, sustainable agriculture, and other applications. The continual improvement of tissue culture techniques that promote high-quality cell systems as well as the use of BV as a display system is building on the improvement of the quality of insect cell media and efficiency of cultivation. Generally, insect biotechnology is a most auspicious development in modern scientific and biotechnological pursuits leading to scalable and safe IC-BEVS-dependent biomanufacturing processes.",
