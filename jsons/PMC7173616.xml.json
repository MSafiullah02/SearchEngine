There are five different genera in the family: Influenzavirus A, B, and C, Thogotovirus, and Isavirus. Influenza viruses are classified into three types: A, B, and C. Type A influenza viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the antigenic properties of their surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 known HA subtypes (H1\u2013H18) and 11 known NA subtypes (N1\u2013N11) of influenza A. Viruses containing HA proteins from each of the first 16 HA subtypes and NAs of the first 9 NA subtypes, in different combinations, are maintained in a reservoir of wild aquatic birds. Bat-derived H17N10 and H18N11 subtypes have also been identified.",

Natural variation in HA amino acid sequence due to selective pressure over time results in antigenic drift, limiting the long-term effectiveness of anti-influenza vaccines. Consequently, annual updates to the vaccine composition are required to maintain a match to the viruses that are currently circulating.

The highly conserved and hydrophobic N-terminal residues of HA2, known as the fusion peptide (see below), are buried from solvent upon cleavage. It is known that these residues insert into the host membrane to facilitate virus-cell membrane fusion.

For example, the H1 HA protein from the virus that caused the pandemic of 1918 has five glycosylation sites in HA1 and one in HA2. H1 HA proteins isolated from viruses circulating in 2002 had accumulated an additional six potential glycosylation sites with respect to the 1918 H1 HA protein.

            "text": "The HA protein mediates the first stage of virus infection via binding to terminal sialic acid sugars on host glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sialic acids are usually found in either \u03b1-2,3- or \u03b1-2,6-linkages to galactose, the predominant penultimate sugar of N-linked carbohydrate side chains. The binding preference of an HA protein for one of these linkage types correlates with the species that the virus infects. The avian enteric tract has predominantly sialic acid in the \u03b1-2,3- linkage, and all HA proteins found in the first 16 antigenic subtypes found in avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to this linkage. In cells of the human upper respiratory tract, however, sialic acid in the \u03b1-2,6-linkage predominates. Indeed, the HA proteins from human influenza viruses display a binding preference for sialic acid in the \u03b1-2,6-linkage. An avian origin has been proposed for human influenza viruses and, therefore, a change in binding specificity is required for cross-species transfer. While the precise details of the amino acid changes underlying this switch in specificity seem to be HA subtype dependent, it has been shown for both H1 and H3 HA proteins that only a small number of mutations are necessary. For example, a single mutation in H3 HA of Gln-226 to Leu-226 causes a switch in specificity from \u03b1-2,3- to \u03b1-2,6-binding preference. Insights into the amino acids involved in avian and human receptor binding have also been gained from elucidating the structures of HA proteins in complex with receptor analogs. The HA proteins from bat H17 and H18 subtypes have a distorted receptor binding pocket, do not bind the canonical glycan receptors for either humans or avians, and presumably have a novel receptor that has not yet been defined.",

            "text": "The structure of HA0 has also been elucidated via crystallization of a protein in which Arg-329 had been mutated to a glutamine to prevent proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide. The structure revealed that the cleavage site is located in a prominent surface loop, which lies adjacent to a cavity not present in the cleaved-HA structure. There are three ionizable residues in this cavity that are buried from solvent after cleavage due to the burial of the nearly formed N-terminus of HA2 (fusion peptide). Thus, it has been proposed that cleavage of HA0 results in a metastable form of the protein in which a low-pH trigger has been set due to the burial of ionizable residues. A characteristic of highly pathogenic influenza viruses such as the currently circulating H5N1 viruses is an insertion of a series of basic residues adjacent to the cleavage site. This polybasic insertion would create a much more extended surface loop that is recognized by intracellular proteases. Facile intracellular cleavage allows expanded tropism, and often systemic influenza virus spread, thereby promoting enhanced pathogenicity.",

After receptor binding, the influenza virus is internalized via endocytosis, exposing the virus to a low-pH environment that triggers a dramatic and irreversible conformational change in the HA protein. Exposure of the HA protein to low pH causes an alteration in the protonation state of residues that are buried by the fusion peptide, resulting in its removal from its buried site. Subsequently, the middle of the original long \u03b1-helix of HA2 unfolds to form a reverse turn, jack-knifing the C-terminal half backward toward the N-terminus. This results in HA2 adopting a rod-like coiled-coil structure. HA1, which was missing from the crystal structure, de-trimerizes and swings away from the HA2 but the interchain disulfide bond is maintained. As a consequence of these molecular rearrangements, the N-terminal fusion peptide, which inserts into the host membrane, and the C-terminal transmembrane anchor of HA2, which is tethered to the viral envelope, are placed at the same end of the HA molecule, thereby facilitating membrane fusion (Figure 2\n).",

The receptor-binding domains of both HEF and HA are structurally similar despite HEF binding 9-O-acetyl sialic acid rather than sialic acid. The receptor-destroying domain shows structural homology to bacterial esterases, in keeping with its activity as a 9-O-acetylesterase. The stem region of the HEF protein is similar to that observed in the HA protein except that the triple-stranded, \u03b1-helical bundle diverges at both its ends and the fusion peptide is partially exposed to solvent.

Chemical exploitation of this cavity is currently being undertaken in the development of a new generation of anti-influenza drugs to address the problem of mutations in the NA protein that cause resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Just as the bat-derived H17 and H18 HA proteins do not bind sialic acid, their respective N10 and N11 NA proteins are not sialidases. The N10 and N11 NA proteins have an overall tetrameric structure similar to the N1\u2013N9 NA proteins. Reflective of their lack of sialidase activity, the N10 and N11 NA proteins have active sites divergent, and more open, compared to the active sites of the sialidases comprising N1\u2013N9 subtypes.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses undergo a process known as \u201cantigenic drift\u201d whereby natural variants of the HA and NA proteins occur, due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA polymerase. The HA protein is the major molecule recognized by the adaptive immune system of the host, although the NA protein does elicit an immune response. Upon infection of a cell, the virus causes an immune response that commonly results in the production of antibodies. In the case of the HA protein, neutralizing antibodies prevent the virus from binding to cells. While not preventing viral entry, antibodies against the NA protein prevent spread of the virus and afford some protection against challenge with the same or similar virus.",

Whereas, in the case of H3 HA subtype viruses isolated between 1968 and 2005, two-thirds of the residues that are not retained are buried. This suggests that the \u201cfixed\u201d substitutions have been selected because they alter the local structure of the HA protein and prevent antibody binding.",

Thus sites of mAb-selected mutations indicate the sites at which selecting antibodies bind. These mutants escape neutralization by the selecting antibody. The antibodies nevertheless still bind, but with a much reduced affinity. There appears to be no preference in the type of amino acid change that occurs in selected variants.",
