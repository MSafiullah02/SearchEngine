Up to 24 July 2013, a total of 90 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 45 deaths. The majority of infections are sporadic. Human to human transmission has been documented in at least 3 hospital settings6, 7, 8 and 4 community clusters.9, 10, 11, 12 We report the clinical and epidemiological details of a second family cluster of two confirmed and one probable MERS-CoV infections in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, occurred in February and March 2013. We hypothesize that the index case in the cluster is likely to have acquired the infection whilst in hospital from a contact with unrecognized MERS-CoV infection.",

He was admitted on 30 January 2013 thru the Emergency Department in Hospital A in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with a 2-month history of progressive back pain, lower limb weakness and urinary incontinence. There was no history of travel or recent contact with sick animals. Magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of a paraspinal mass at the 4th lumbar vertebral level. Further investigations confirmed a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. He was transferred to a medical ward on 8 February 2013 for further management. On 13 February 2013, 14 days after hospital admission, he developed high fever, cough, shortness of breath and hypoxia requiring high flow oxygen via face mask. He commenced meropenem, vancomycin, voriconazole and oseltamivir. By the morning of 15 February 2013, his condition deteriorated with respiratory failure and progressive pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. Renal failure ensued and continuous renal replacement therapy was started on 18 February 2013. Colistin and tigecycline were added on 20 February 2013. The patient's condition remained poor and he passed away on 24 February 2013, 11 days after the onset of his respiratory symptoms. Bacterial cultures of blood, urine and sputum were all negative.",

He had had no significant past medical history prior to this acute illness. He visited a private clinic on 27 February 2013 and was prescribed a course of oral cefuroxime without any improvement. He was admitted on 28 February to Hospital B in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with hypoxia and extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 1\n). He received vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin and oseltamivir, in addition to intravenous hydrocortisone and high flow oxygen by a face mask. Twenty-four hours later, he required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The next day, vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were substituted with linezolid and imipenem and his ventilation was switched to high frequency oscillatory mode. On 2 March 2013, continuing respiratory failure prompted a shift to extra-corporal membrane oxygenation. The patient's clinical condition failed to improve and he passed away 2 hours later, 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Cultures of blood, urine and sputum taken at the time of admission to hospital were all negative. Candida albicans was isolated from culture of sputum taken on 2 March 2013. Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and mycobacterial cultures were negative.",

There were no domestic animals or birds in the family home, but bats had been noted in a small neglected park behind the house. Patient 1 had a farm outside Riyadh, in which he kept sheep, chicken, ducks and pigeons. He visited the farm once or twice a week. His last visit was 2 days prior to his admission to hospital.

He had spent 9 days in the Emergency Department before he was transferred to 2 different 2-bedded rooms. The upper end of MERS-CoV incubation period is thought to be around 14 days, with most patients having symptoms within the first week of contact.8, 18 It is therefore likely that Patient 1 acquired MERS-CoV infection during his hospitalization. This could have been from an asymptomatic HCW, one of the patients who were placed in close proximity to Patient 1 during his stay in the Emergency Department or from one of the numerous visitors he received whilst in the medical ward. In a previously described family cluster of MER-CoV infections, the index patient had a protracted clinical course including urinary tract infection and cardiac failure before respiratory infection became apparent.10 The authors suggest that in-hospital acquisition might be one explanation. Furthermore, in the largest human-to-human cluster of MERS-CoV infections described so far, one of the index cases was identified as a probable case based on his son's subsequent positive test.8 Unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the community and in healthcare settings may be a more significant problem than previously appreciated.",

Out of over 400 HCWs who had been in contact with 31 patients in 4 different countries, only 2 had documented MERV-CoV infection.8, 9, 20, 21 Whether HCWs play a role in transmitting MERS-CoV through hand and surface contamination is an interesting but yet unproven hypothesis. Fourteen confirmed cases of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection have so far been reported to the WHO, including 4 HCWs.22 Such asymptomatic carriage may explain some of the transmission that has taken place in hospital and in community settings. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the available MERS-CoV genomes suggested a common ancestor halfway through the year 2011.8, 19 It appears that the virus circulated in the community for at least one year before the first clinical case was recognized.",

The high mortality rate associated with MERS-CoV infection increasingly appears to be due to the under-diagnosis of mild and asymptomatic cases as a result of the restrictive case definition put forward by WHO.16 All 3 patients in our report had fever, cough, shortness of breath, pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-rays, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. All these are relatively common clinical features amongst patients with MERS-CoV infection (Table 1). Many of these were also seen in patients affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003; however, the 2 diseases have distinctly different infectivity patterns.25 Although not necessarily diagnostic, the presence of these findings without an alternative explanation should prompt earlier consideration of MERS-CoV infection and initiation of appropriate investigations. It should be noted that collating data from small reports in order to understand the clinical features of an emergent infection has numerous self-evident limitations. A global, collaborative effort among clinicians and scientists studying this disease is needed to develop and identify more predictive diagnostic and prognostic markers.26\n",
