            "text": "Beta-coronaviruses are a subgroup of the coronavirus family, large enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses able to infect a wide variety of mammals and avian species, causing mainly respiratory or enteric diseases [1]. They present surface spikes formed by (S) glycoproteins, which mediate binding to susceptible host cell receptors to initiate the infection [2]. To date, seven beta-coronaviruses are known to cause human disease. The prevalent strains (HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43) typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans [3], while three strains were found to pose a severe health threat, leading in some cases to a fatal outcome: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 [4]. SARS-CoV was recognized as the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak occurring in China in 2002 and 2003 [5], while MERS-CoV was responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome occurring in 2012 [6]. In both cases, the infected patients manifested severe acute pneumonia, but while SARS-CoV infected mainly the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV caused more pronounced gastrointestinal symptoms, often associated with kidney failure [7]. This can be possibly explained by a difference in recognition of host surface receptors. While the primary human receptor for SARS S glycoprotein is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed on the surface of the cells in the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV preferentially binds to surface enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), which is present both in the lower respiratory tract as well as the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract [8,9,10]. This distribution may also explain the observed difference in transmission of the two viruses [7]. The third highly pathogenic strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [11]. It is a highly aggressive new coronavirus that has infected more than 540,000 people (at 27 March 2020), with an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% [12]. In less than two months, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak spread from the Hubei Province to 26 other countries, reaching also the US and Europe, with Italy being the European country with the highest number of patients tested positive for the new coronavirus [13] with 80,589 affected people and 8215 deaths by 27 March 2020. Given the emergency, the characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and features of virus-host interactions demand that we identify the candidate molecules to inhibit viral functions. Sequence similarity of new coronavirus with SARS and MERS was previously reported and close similarities with wild bat coronaviruses has been reported [14]. New coronavirus spike S glycoprotein sequence shares a sequence identity above 72% with human SARS, showing a unique furin-like cleavage site, which is a feature absent in the other SARS-like CoVs [15]. Biophysical and structural evidence that new SARS-CoV-2 may bind the ACE2 receptor with higher affinity than SARS-CoV has been recently reported [9]. The wide distribution and similarity of this receptor in the animal kingdom may account for cross-species transmission [16], while the pattern of expression of ACE2 in human respiratory epithelia and oral mucosa may explain the fast human-human transmission [17].",

The analysis of cell-context specific repertoires of molecular interactions, or interactomes, is becoming increasingly useful to dissect molecular pathways and biological processes, since they offer the possibility to get a comprehensive overview of cellular regulatory programs [20]. Integration of interactome maps to gene-regulatory networks (i.e., topological maps representing relationships between transcription factors and their target genes) can better provide insights into critical cellular elements that regulate a certain phenotypic state or response [21]. It has been observed that a number of large-scale transcriptional cascades behind complex cellular processes can be explained by the action of a relatively small number of transcription factors, or Master Regulators [22,23,24]. The identification of the most crucial factors governing a determined phenotypic state is known as Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) [25]. In this study, we set out to apply an integrated network approach combining protein interactions and transcriptional networks to identify Master Regulators of coronavirus infections in human airway cells, in the hope of shedding more light on the virus/host interaction mechanism and also on the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2.",

In order to understand how this interactome is functionally affected by the viral infection, we obtained transcriptome wide microarray data depicting gene expression changes upon MERS-CoV [36] and SARS-CoV [33] on human bronchial-derived 2B4 cells. We, therefore, performed Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) [22] using a context-specific network model derived from the largest available human lung RNA-Seq dataset from GTEX [29]. The analysis allowed us to have a robust readout not only of the changes of the transcript of each protein-encoding human gene in the interactome, but also of its proximal functional network [31]. Since transcriptomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet available, we reasoned that combining the SARS-CoV-2 specific interactome with transcriptome-wide datasets from two viruses belonging to the same family would provide a robust readout of the human cell response to this new virus.",

Apoptosis is a complex molecular cascade usually activated to eliminate unwanted cells in a living organism, for example during development, and it can be self-initiated or induced by immune system cells [51]. Also, during virus attacks, induced cell death is a known mechanism to get rid of infected cells: specifically, the activation of MCL1 in coronavirus infection has been observed as an early host cell mechanism of antiviral defense [52]. It is, therefore, likely that the host cell is able to sense the virus, perhaps even by the direct interaction between MCL1 and the viral ORF7a (Figure 1), and able to start the apoptotic cascade and shut down both itself and the replicating viruses. An increase in mitochondria-mediated apoptotic response upon SARS-CoV infection has been reported before, although its prevention did not seem to affect viral replication kinetics [53]. However, apoptosis has been reported to help the spreading of the virus by increasing replication rates and virion release from the dying cell in avian coronaviruses [54].",

ACE2 is exploited by SARS-CoV as its cellular entrance, which is based on the initial interaction between the viral S (spike) protein and ACE2 [66]. Several recent studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells depends on the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 [64,67]. Its down-regulation upon SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection could intuitively be an innate cell defense mechanism to remove this extracellular marker to reduce the capability of the virus to enter the host cell, while at the same time reducing the RNA metabolic machinery through EEF1A1 down-regulation. ACE2 is also targeted by the neuraminidase protein of the influenza A virus [68]. However, the down-regulation of ACE2 has also been shown to be beneficial to viral infection, as it can trigger lung injury and faster cell-to-cell virus spreading [69]. In influenza A (cause by orthomyxoviruses, also RNA-based), high levels of ACE2 have in fact been correlated to increased resistance to the infection [68]. So, like in apoptosis induction, the down-regulation of ACE2 could be a SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanism from which the virus gains in capability to spread faster by damaging the host lung tissue.",

Our analysis confirms previous reports [14] that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are indeed highly related to SARS-CoV-2, with genome sequence identity of ~80%. However, these two human viruses are likely not the most direct ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted by our phylogenetic analysis based on several beta-coronaviruses ([14] and Supplementary Figure S1). The evolutionary history model shows that SARS and MERS viruses are more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 than wild beta-coronaviruses infecting bats and pangolins, in concordance with current evolutionary models [70], suggesting an almost certain zoonotic origin of this virus [71]. Our analysis shows that at least one bat beta-coronavirus sequence derived from the GISAID database (EPI_ISL_402131) appears to be the closest to the group of human SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, this is based on a low bootstrap tree branching confidence (37%), and we observed a large quantity of pangolin beta-coronaviruses [72], which are likely to be equidistant from the human causes of COVID-19.",

These sequences appear to be conserved in these species, having the exact same aminoacid length (805aa). The sequence identity between the human and pangolin ACE2 is 84.76%, while the identity between human and bat ACE2 is lower: 80.60%. Bootstrapped maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate ACE2 family also shows that the pangolin ACE2 protein is closer to the human ortholog than the bat sequence (Figure 4A). In Figure 4B, we provide a visualization of the human ACE2 structure, inferred via X-ray crystallography at 2.20 \u00c5, which is one of the highest resolutions for this protein [73], and highlight all the residuals identical in human and pangolins, but different between humans and bats. Finally, the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the proteins from the three mammals reports the specific ACE2 amino acids that differ between the species (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S3). The higher similarity between human and pangolin ACE2 proteins may support the hypothesis that the pangolin could either be the original host of SARS-CoV-2, or an intermediate host for the transmission of the virus from a wild reservoir (e.g., bats\u2192pangolins\u2192humans).",
