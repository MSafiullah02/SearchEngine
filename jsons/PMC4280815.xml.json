In March 2014, an outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) involving the elementary and high school (\u223c200 students combined) of a rural community (population < 1500) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, was reported, with 15% and 8% of the student populations affected, respectively. Rash associated with ILI was noted in four students, including generalized maculopapular rash in an elementary-school child. Interest in fever associated with rash illness was heightened because of a large measles outbreak occurring simultaneously elsewhere in the province. This case series describes an outbreak of ILI and rash associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza B in schoolchildren.",

Laboratory testing was conducted according to standard protocols at the BC Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory1 that encourage submission of specimens from up to six patients to arrive at ILI outbreak diagnosis. Further specimens were collected to ensure that ILI cases with rash known to the local health unit were included in diagnostic testing. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for respiratory viruses by the Respiratory Virus Panel Luminex\u00ae assay, which includes targets for influenza A/H3, A/H1 and B; RSV; coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1; parainfluenza 1\u20134; human metapneumovirus A/B; entero/rhinovirus; adenovirus; and bocavirus. Further nucleic acid testing for measles, enterovirus and mumps was conducted. Influenza-positive specimens were sequenced to determine lineage and where possible, virus was isolated in cell culture to determine strain by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Paired sera were collected, and antibody titres were assessed by HI using live and ether-extracted B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like (Yamagata-lineage) and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria-lineage) viruses. Sera were also tested for IgM/IgG to measles, human parvovirus-B19 and rubella. Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained by local public health staff using a standard questionnaire.",

Although a nasopharyngeal specimen collected from E1 at 6 days post-ILI onset was influenza negative by RT-PCR, HI antibody titres to B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like virus in sera collected from E1 were comparable to or higher than titres in C1\u2013C6. In all cases, titres were lower in paired sera collected 21\u201333 days after the first serum. This likely reflects the 8- to 14-day delay from ILI onset to first serum collection, at which point infection-induced titres may have already been peaking and fourfold rise (i.e. sero-conversion) could not subsequently be shown. On balance, serologic findings in E1 are more consistent with recent influenza B infection than prior immunization. In all children, HI titres were higher when using ether-extracted versus live influenza B virus, as expected, but trends were similar. In two children with localized rash (C4, C5), titres were similar or higher to the alternate B/Victoria-lineage compared to the B/Yamagata-lineage strain confirmed by PCR and/or culture to be the cause of their current ILI.",

Six of seven students investigated (including three with localized rash) had laboratory-confirmed influenza B, while the seventh with generalized rash had serologic evidence of infection and was confirmed through epidemiological links to two laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza B in the same classroom (one also with rash). Although amoxicillin may have been a contributing factor in the laboratory-confirmed classmate with localized rash, lack of recurrence with subsequent re-exposure to the same antibiotic argues against allergic aetiology.

            "text": "While no conclusions can be drawn from a single case, it is interesting that the child with generalized rash was the only one in the current series to have received influenza vaccine. Immunization would not have been a direct cause of rash 3 months later but prior sensitization may nevertheless be relevant. Pre-existing vaccine- or infection-induced antibody might be hypothesized to play a role in rash pathogenesis through the rapid formation of antigen\u2013antibody complexes upon re-exposure. In that regard, it is also interesting that 2 of 3 children with localized rash (and no history of prior influenza immunization) raised substantial antibody titres to previously circulating B/Victoria-lineage virus, suggesting prior infection-induced priming to epitopes shared with the currently infecting B/Yamagata-lineage strain. Antigen and antibody levels at a precise balance may be required for complex formation and in explaining the unusual occurrence and varying nature of influenza-associated rash, particularly late in the season. Ultimately, proposed mechanisms for influenza-associated rash remain speculative. However, prior receipt of the current season's TIV is nevertheless important because it may have attenuated the amount and duration of virus shedding, relevant given the negative RT-PCR result in the child with generalized rash and 6-day delay to nasopharyngeal specimen collection. High titres to B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like virus in that child's sera reinforce the influenza B diagnosis otherwise confirmed through epidemiologic links. Ultimately, however, we cannot rule out other unrecognized aetiologies or contributing factors. Multiplex testing did not identify another viral infection, but the association between influenza and rash does not prove causality; it remains possible that patients in this series were simultaneously infected with an unidentified pathogen or that some other environmental factor contributed.",
