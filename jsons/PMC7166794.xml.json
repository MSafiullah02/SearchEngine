There are currently 7 recognized syndromes related to PCV2 infections. Many of these syndromes are a result of coinfection with PCV2 virus and other agents like Mycoplasma and PRRSV. Diagnosis of PCV can occasionally be difficult because of nondescript clinical signs but diagnostic lab tests are available. The current knowledge and research into vaccines is providing relief for the swine producer from the heavy losses associated with the disease. Key points in reducing loses are centered on proper vaccination and management. The reduction in swine loses already being witnessed after the introduction of vaccines in the world market has been significant, and further research to provide even better vaccines will likely continue to reduce economic loss in the world swine market.",
