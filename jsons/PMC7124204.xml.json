            "text": "Carbon dioxide is one of the key greenhouse gases causing global warming; most world governments have recognized the risk of global warming and urgency for carbon reduction. With rapid industrialization and urbanization, China's CO2 emissions were 3405.1799 Mt in 2000, and it increased rapidly with the average growth rate of 8.2% from 2000 to 2013. China's CO2 emissions are at their highest since 2006 (Gregg, Andres, & Marland, 2008). During the same period of 2000\u20132013, China's contribution to global carbon emissions rose from 13.7% to 28.6% (Fig. 1\n) (World Bank, 2016). To mitigate carbon emissions and global warming, China has made different environmental policies and taken effective measures (Li and Lin, 2016, Wu et al., 2016). In particular, China has raised a target of decreasing carbon intensity (CO2 emissions divided by gross domestic product (GDP)) to 40\u201345% of 2005 levels by 2020 (Li et al., 2016, Qiu, 2009). In the Twelfth Five-Year (2011\u20132015) Plan drafted by China's State Council, the target of carbon emission were allocated to the provinces for the first time (Hao, Liao, & Wei, 2015a). China pledged that the peak of CO2 emissions would achieve around 2030, carbon intensity would decline to 60%\u201365% of 2005 levels by 2030 in China (National Development and Reform Commission of China, 2015). The allocation of carbon emission reductions has attracted the attention of scholars (Liao et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014), but there are relatively few studies from the perspective of convergence for carbon intensity (Hao et al., 2015a, Wang et al., 2014b). Many climate policies assume that there is convergence (McKibbin and Stegman, 2005, McKibbin et al., 2007, Pettersson et al., 2014). The convergence of carbon intensity can provide an important reference for the equal allocation of carbon intensity targets and contribute to the projections of carbon intensity (McKibbin and Stegman, 2005, Pettersson et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the existing convergence of carbon intensity is helpful to make better environmental policies and it is a necessary condition to achieve the peak of carbon emission (Jobert et al., 2010, McKibbin and Stegman, 2005). Analyzing the convergence of carbon intensity is helpful to cognize the change mechanism of carbon intensity and to set evidence-based policies for carbon intensity targets. Convergence of carbon intensity is of particular concern to policymakers in China, and government establishes some important targets of decreasing carbon intensity (Li and Lin, 2016, Wu et al., 2016). Instead of equal allocation of carbon intensity to each province, the allocation of carbon intensity to prefecture-level city can be more effective (Wu et al., 2016). Therefore, investigation of the convergence of carbon intensity is important for policymakers to provide suggestions in allocating carbon intensity targets according to carbon intensity rules.",

To our knowledge, Strazicich and List (2003) probably made the first attempt to test the conditional and stochastic convergence in 21 industrial countries during the period of 1960\u20131997 and found that there was significant convergence. Pettersson et al. (2014) reviewed the development literature of the convergence. The research on the scale of carbon convergence mainly focuses on countries (Fallahi and Voia, 2015, Jobert et al., 2010, McKitrick and Wood, 2013, Ord\u00e1s Criado and Grether, 2011) or provinces (Hao et al., 2015a, Wang and Zhang, 2014, Yang et al., 2016). For example, Ord\u00e1s Criado and Grether (2011) investigated the convergence of per capita CO2 in 166 world areas during 1960\u20132000 and found that there were different convergence states during different periods. Wang and Zhang (2014) investigated the convergence of CO2 in China's six sectors in provincial level during 1996\u20132010 and found that there was convergence in these sectors.",

Bayesian shrinkage estimation (BSE) was applied by Jobert et al. (2010) to examined the convergence of CO2 emissions during 1971\u20132006 and they found that there was absolute convergence. Semi-parametric and non-parametric models were employed to investigate the convergence of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides in 25 European countries during 1980\u20132005 (Ord\u00e1s Criado, Valente, & Stengos, 2011). The log t test was used by Wang et al. (2014b) to verify the convergence of carbon intensity in China during 1995\u20132011 and they found that there was divergence at the national level but convergence at the provincial level. Spatial lag model (SLM) was utilized by Huang and Meng (2013) to investigate CO2 emissions convergence and they found that the convergence rate showed an increasing trend when considering spatial effects. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) model and spatial error model (SEM) was used by Yu (2012) to verify the convergence of Chinese energy intensity and the result showed absolute \u03b2-convergence across provinces.",

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the convergence of carbon intensity across prefecture-level cities using grid data in the YRD. Compared with provincial data, prefecture-level city data can provide more accurate and detailed results; meanwhile, prefecture-level cities are the main source of carbon emissions. In addition, we investigate the convergence of carbon intensity rather than carbon emissions per capita, which can better assist policymakers in allocating the reduction targets of carbon emissions. Furthermore, we consider spatial spillover effects and spatial dependence, utilizing spatial econometric models that examine \u03b2-convergence, better simulating the actual values.",

Table 1\nshows descriptive statistics of all related variables. GDP per capita is taken as a representation of economic development level, as it has an important impact on carbon intensity (Zhao, Burnett, & Fletcher, 2014). Wang, Zhang, and Liu (2016b) found the more developed prefecture-level city the more likely to reduce carbon intensity in China. The secondary industry is the main source of CO2 emissions, and thus the higher the proportion of the secondary industry's value in GDP, the more difficult to reduce carbon intensity (Hao et al., 2015a). The population factor is usually utilized to analyze carbon emissions, but there is a variable relationship between population density and carbon intensity. Zhao et al. (2014) suggested that increasing population density would reduce carbon intensity. Hao et al. (2015b) proposed that higher population density may increase the degree of industrialization, which causes higher carbon intensity. The equation of conditional \u03b2-convergence model is as follows (Adhikari & Chen, 2014):(3)ln(CIit+1/CIit)=a+\u03b2lnCIit+\u03b2cxit+\u03b5itwhere x\nit is the control variable; \u03b2\nc represents the coefficients of control variables; and other variables share the same meanings as in equations (1), (2).",

Chinese government executed stricter energy policies in the Tenth Five-Year Plan Period (2000\u20132005) by adjusting the energy and industrial structures (Yuan & Zuo, 2011). Land use change, particular farmland converted to settlement and industry parks, also change the carbon emission in the YRD (Lai et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2015). With the effective measures, carbon intensity presented a downward trend during 2000\u20132002 and 2004\u20132010 (Fig. 5). Carbon intensity showed an increasing trend in 2003, 2004 and 2008. Domestic and international events may affect the trends. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in China, causing a serious impact on human health and economic activities, the effects of which continued into the following year (Zhong et al., 2003). In 2008, a global financial crisis engulfed the world (Lu et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2015) with serious impacts on social and economic development in the YRD. The YRD has a processing trade development model in the low added value segment of high-end products (labor-intensive areas, low value-added sectors), both low efficiency and high risk (Chen, 2007). It is easily affected by global economic fluctuations, as a decrease in external demand leads to a substantial decrease in exports. Internal and external factors change economic development, which cause the change of carbon intensity. China executed a series of measures to address the global financial crisis; the \u201cfour trillion plan\u201d was implemented by the Chinese government in 2008 (Chen, Pan, Wang, & Shen, 2016), and industrial transformation and upgrading was executed in the YRD, which pulled economic development out of the trough (Liu & Li, 2015).",

The government should adjust the industrial structure, reducing the proportion of the secondary industry, increasing the proportion of the tertiary industry (Wang, Fang, & Wang, 2016a).

When population density exceeds a critical threshold, the increase in population density will increase the carbon intensity. In some prefecture-level cities of the YRD, the population density is higher, and it may exceed the critical value (Tian, Jiang, Yang, & Zhang, 2011). Considering that each prefecture-level city has a certain population carrying capacity, population density should be controlled to make sure that every person can share public facilities and minimize environmental impact (Yang, 2014).",

Meanwhile, the SEM considering spatial factors increases the convergence speed of carbon intensity from 0.0789 to 0.0912, suggesting that considering spatial factors accelerates the convergence rate. The results are similar to the finding of Zhao, Wesley Burnett, and Lacombe (2015). It is important for policymakers to consider spatial factors when setting carbon intensity reduction targets. To reduce carbon intensity, policy intervention in prefecture-level cities should match the policies of neighboring prefecture-level cities. We can set up a low carbon pilot area, summarizing the experiences and lessons of low carbon development to provide references for the development of other regions. Compared to the national average of convergence speed of 0.229 (Hao et al., 2015a), the convergence speed is lower, only 0.1753 in the YRD and the reason is the lower carbon intensity in the YRD.",

Using grid data analyses in ArcGIS 10.2 and spatial econometric methods offers a new method for analyzing the convergence of carbon intensity. In addition, we investigated the convergence of carbon intensity rather than carbon emissions used by previous scholars. Our investigation provides guidance for the allocation of carbon intensity reductions in the YRD. Furthermore, considering spatial factors, we employed SEM and SLM to analyze the convergence of carbon intensity, finding that a spatial spillover effect is significant in the annual growth rate of carbon intensity across prefecture-level cities in the YRD; the spatial spillover effect accelerates the convergence rate.",

In future study, steady state level of each prefecture-level city could be estimated under new theoretical framework.
