This could be consistent with higher antibody levels or other immune mechanisms of protection compared to younger patients. Enrollment binding antibody titers were higher in group 1 than group 2 subjects. However, the actual proportion of RI that were associated with HCoV by serologic change or PCR was not different comparing the two groups. A total of 15 (20.3%) of 74 RI in group 1 were assessed as being associated with HCoV infection compared to 28 (23.1%) of 121 illnesses in group 2. It is not known what might constitute a protective antibody level against HCoV infection. Concomitant increases in binding antibody to more than one viral strain were likely due to the stimulation of antibodies against conserved cross-reactive antigens expressed by the current infecting strain of HCoV and, due to recall of immune memory, to other strains that previously infected the person earlier in life. Concomitant infection with more than one strain of HCoV during the same RI would be unlikely. Repeated infections with HCoV may partially be explained if natural infection in these adult patients stimulates binding antibodies more commonly than functional neutralizing antibodies. Nonneutralizing antibodies are known to bind to other viral proteins such as the N protein. Stimulation of antibodies to non-S protein epitopes could be an explanation for low correlation between stimulation of binding antibody and neutralizing antibody since neutralizing antibody is directed against the S protein. The psoralen-UV light method of virus inactivation used here should have preserved viral antigenicity, but we did not determine against which viral proteins the binding antibodies were directed. The orientation of the viral antigens coating the ELISA microtiter plates may have affected the epitopes exposed and available for antibody binding. Also, it is possible that some binding antibodies may enhance infection and not be protective against reinfection.

The method of virus inactivation that was used may have preserved the integrity of virions and their antigenicity. We did not confirm that binding antibodies detected in the ELISA were directed against more than the S protein antigens. Only binding antibodies to the recombinant N protein could be measured in the case of -HKU1. There were positive statistical correlations between binding antibody levels in both acute and convalescent sera within HCoV genera. There appeared to be closer correlations between binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera than acute illness sera particularly for HCoV-NL63 and for -OC43, respectively, and closer binding antibody correlations between strains within the Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and -NL63) and between strains within the Betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1) genera. The preexisting serologic status against various strains of coronavirus among patients undergoing acute infection during the serious current outbreak of COVID-19 virus and their immune responses to COVID-19 infection are not known.
