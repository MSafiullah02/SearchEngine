            "text": "On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization formally announced that the novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. Subsequently, all National Health Systems and each medical center faced the exceptional emergency and severe changes in their organizations. Consequently, there were various implications that needed to be addressed for oncology patients. In this sense, there are some practical and important issues in the management of head and neck cancer patients: (i) they are usually older and usually present with medical comorbidities (e.g., COPD and other tobacco-related diseases) that are associated with a higher risk of severe complications associated with COVID-19 ; (ii) high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (transportation, daily radiation fractions, multiple consultations with multidisciplinary team members); (iii) cancer treatment can potentially and theoretically increase the risk of more severe complications of COVID-19. [1] Of interest, the main risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), tobacco and alcohol, also increase the risk for COVID-19 infection. One Chinese study reported an increased risk of cancer-related deaths associated with notorious difficulties of access to oncologic care. In addition, a nationwide analysis in China indicated that the risk of severe respiratory complications leading to admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death was much higher in cancer patients than in patients without cancer (39% vs. 8%, p=0.0003). Moreover, patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery in the past month had a numerically higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving chemotherapy or surgery, irrespective of age, smoking history or co-morbidity (odds ratio 5.34, p=0.0026). [2] [3] [4] [5] The majority of hospitals will be treating thousands of COVID-19 patients in the next few weeks and thus, there is an urgent need to preserve patient and staff safety. For this reason, the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) in the United States recommends that healthcare facilities interrupt elective care and restrict their activities to providing urgent and emergency visits and procedures. It is recommended that all elective and non-time sensitive procedures and admissions must be rescheduled. [6] There is a critical need to share skills and expertise to propose recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As healthcare professionals and HNSCC experts, we aim to offer emergency guidelines aiming to reduce the risk of patient harm, by reducing their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, without compromising their treatment and outcome.",

It is important to mention that local guidelines regarding COVID-19 (both at the national and institutional levels) must be followed to ensure the safety of patients, caregivers and health care professionals. In addition, a general rule, not to deviate from the standard of care in each clinical situation must be followed. [7] These proposed emergency guidelines may have to be modified in the future if new, significant evidencebased information becomes available. Multidisciplinary management continues to be essential for optimal decision making and treatment planning of HNSCC patients and, due to the inability to have in-person meetings, web-based meetings should be encouraged. HNSCC usually has a high proliferation rate and it is also associated with a significant tumor-associated symptom burden. Therefore, delay to initiate oncologic treatments or applying treatment interruptions can cause disease progression and may negatively impact survival outcomes. [8] [9] [10] Although the pandemic scenario is new, the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 is lower than the risk of cancer-related death. [11] While some patients with low-risk disease can be safely managed with a few weeks delay (one or two), this should be decided on a case-by-case discussion.",

[14] In this context, surgery may be indicated in some scenarios due to the shorter treatment time, especially if the requirement of adjuvant radiation therapy is unlikely or a tracheostomy is not needed. Aiming to protect both the patient and health care professionals, all procedures on the upper aerodigestive tract should be performed after proper analysis of the case. Before surgery, patients must be confirmed to be negative on test for COVID-19, have no symptoms and have a negative Chest-CT (for COVID-19 infection). The mandate for a negative chest CT however, is based on institutional standards. Also, a contact with a positivetested individual within the week prior would raise suspicion. If tracheostomy is required, then a non-surgical treatment should be considered if possible. Tracheostomy increases the risk of COVID-19 infection, risk of dissemination, risk of respiratory complications, and possibly risk of death. If surgery is not feasible (due to unavailability of operating rooms which are being used in many countries as ICUs) or the patient is inoperable or refuses the surgical option, then radiation therapy should be recommended.",
