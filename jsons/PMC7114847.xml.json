            "text": "Fundamental guidelines for infection control in hospital environments were posted on the World Health Organization's (WHO) website on 24 April 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak which was ongoing at that time. These guidelines advised that all individuals showing potential SARS-related symptoms should be promptly quarantined in an isolation room. According to SARS statistics published later in 2003 by the WHO,1 this action was instrumental in minimizing the spread of the disease within hospitals caring for SARS victims. For effective infection control, it is essential to maintain a negative pressure between the isolation room and the outside environment. However, a review of the international standards2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 shows that the specified minimum pressure differentials between the isolated field and the non-isolated field vary considerably, i.e. from 2.5 Pa to 30 Pa, and are not even specified in some cases. The tracer containment testing of isolation rooms performed by Rydock and Eian8 showed that even when the isolation room was established at a high pressure differential of 15 Pa and a high ventilation rate of 15\u201321 air changes/h was maintained, leaked gases from the isolation room could still be detected in the anteroom for up to 3 min following the opening of the interconnecting door.",

Furthermore, the results of model VC-05 show that positioning the air-supply and exhaust vents in diametrically opposite corners changes both the direction and location of the region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion of coughed gas. Therefore, this section of the paper investigates the effect on the parallel-directional airflow pattern of staggering the positions of the air-supply and exhaust vents (models VC-06 and VC-07). Comparing the two models, the exhaust vents in the vertical direction are identical and the air-supply vents are located at different positions (Figure 7, Figure 8\n).",

In this arrangement, the air inlets are located in the middle of the end wall opposite the patient, and the exhaust vents located in the facing wall are offset towards the corner of the room. Figure 8(a) shows that circulations are located behind the patient. Additionally, the velocity magnitude distribution is more uniform. As shown in Figure 8(b), in contrast to the previous case, less horizontal circulation is generated in the region of the room bounded by the upper and lower vents. Consequently, less coughed gas is diffused towards the door end of the room. Figure 8(c) shows that the coughed gas with infectious droplets is contained near the patient and around the exhaust vents. Significantly, model VC-07 demonstrates the smallest region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion of coughed gas. Therefore, this particular ventilation arrangement provides good results for infection control, and enhances staff safety when performing medical treatments inside the isolation room.",

This result suggests that the diluting effect within an isolation room is dependent on the air-changing rate, but is nearly independent of the airflow pattern. However, as shown by the simulation results presented in the sections above, different airflow patterns lead to different airflow behaviours inside the room, and hence have different containment effects. Therefore, the airflow patterns are an important and significant parameter when designing ventilation systems to enhance the efficiency of infection control within isolation rooms.",

For this reason, the case of a patient with frequent coughing must be considered for the practical operation of an isolation system. A few simulations have been performed in order to consider the effect of frequent coughing on the design of ventilation configuration. Simulated results showed that the droplet fallout region is not broadened in the case of frequent coughing, and dispersion of infective droplets is not significantly influenced by the gravity effect in the isolation room when air flow within the room is in the steady state. However, for a patient with frequent coughing, the concentration of coughed gas will increase inside the isolation room. The increased concentration depends on the frequency (coughs/min) and the duration of a sustained burst of coughing, so the required diluting time can be calculated by the following equation8:(2)Dilutingtime=\u2212ln(Cs/Cm)ACH(unitofdilutingtime:h)where ACH is the air-changing rate, C\nm is the maximum concentration of coughed gas after a sustained burst of coughing, and C\ns is a specified safety concentration inside the isolation room.
