            "text": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a non-specific diffuse brain dysfunction in sepsis patients, in the absence of intracranial infections or other known causes of brain dysfunction. A range of pathophysiological mechanisms has been proposed for the occurrence and development of SAE7\u20139. Injury to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been indicated to be an important link in the proposed mechanisms10\u201313. The biomarker, S100 beta (S100B) in serum, has been shown to be a credible marker for assessing the severity of brain injury14,15 and predicting the outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI)16, stroke17, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy18, and postoperative delirium19. This biomarker could, therefore, reflect glial cell injury and the blood-brain barrier destruction in sepsis. A growing number of studies have suggested that increased serum S100B levels are associated with brain dysfunction in sepsis patients20\u201322. However, other studies have also shown that neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels but not S100B levels in severe sepsis or septic shock could predict fatal outcome in patients23,24. An observational study with a small sample size reported that physicians could not distinguish between patients with different severities of encephalopathy in sepsis based on serum S100B25. In contrast to that, our previous work verified that S100B in serum, rather than NSE, was a better biomarker for SAE26. However, the sensitivity and specificity of S100B for the diagnosis and prognosis of SAE were not excellent. Serum S100B levels varied rapidly in the first 24\u201348 hrs after brain injury16, which indicated that serum S100B levels may better reflect the brain damage process in sepsis after 48 hrs.",

Changes that occur in SAE are continuous and dynamic. Therefore, there is a need to assess biomarkers that exhibit varying responses to the severity of brain injury. The dynamic changes of serum S100B level may make it a viable marker for determining disease severity in septic encephalopathy27. A study reported that the average serum S100B level increased during the first 48 hrs in the early death group20. Another study showed that the magnitude of the decline in serum S100B levels in the brain dysfunction group was significantly less compared with that in the non-brain dysfunction group within 4 days post-admission28. A recent study also suggested that the S100B levels in the plasma of patients with SAE were significantly higher than those in the control group from day 1 to day 729. Furthermore, there was no significant decrease in the plasma S100B levels between day 1 and day 329. To date, only a few prospective studies have aimed at assessing the role of dynamic changes in S100B levels in patients with sepsis brain injury.",

The normal distribution of quantitative data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), and the abnormal distribution of quantitative data were presented as median (quartile range)., The independent-samples t-test was used for normally distributed continuous variables. The chi-square test for the fourfold table was used for categorical data (when the theoretical frequency was <5, the continuous correction method was adopted and when the theoretical frequency was <1, the exact probability method was adopted). The theoretical frequency of data in the EQ-5D table is too small, thus, the chi-square test of the fourfold table for analysis was used by combining the \u201cModerate problems\u201d and \u201cSevere problems\u201d data. The correlation between serum S100B levels and GCS scores was analyzed using Spearman\u2019s rank-coefficient test. Mann-Whitney test was used to test for abnormal distribution of continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created and compared using the log-rank test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the ability of S100B1 and S100B3 to diagnose SAE and predict 28-day mortality. The correlation between variables was analyzed by the Pearson\u2019s linear regression test for normal distribution data or Spearman\u2019s rank-coefficient test for non-normal distribution data.

The morbidity rate observed in this study was similar to the results of a recent French prospective large multicenter study30. The introduction of CAM-ICU criteria enabled an increased detection in the number of patients who presented with delirium, which could explain why a higher incidence of SAE was observed in the present study. The lower mortality rate in the current study, particularly in the non-SAE group, may be credited to optimized treatment methods. Our earlier study included more patients with lung infection while the present study included more patients with abdominal infection. However, the severity of illness and the incidence of SAE in patients with lung infection were significantly higher in the present study compared with those in the previous study. The higher serum S100B level in this study compared to that in the previous study could be due to the increased age of patients, a higher number of patients with positive blood culture, and a higher lactate level of patients.",

A study showed that the peak level of serum S100B was observed at approximately 27 hrs after TBI16. Another study also demonstrated that a secondary peak of serum S100B beyond 48 hrs after TBI was strongly correlated with later pathological findings in CT scan and MRI38.

For sepsis patients with sustained brain damage, serum S100B levels may continually increase, especially in patients with severe encephalopathy. In this study, there was no significant difference in serum S100B levels from day 1 to day 3 in the SAE group; however, S100B levels on day 3 were significantly lower than S100B levels on day 1 in the non-SAE group. The efficiency of S100B levels on day 3 for the diagnosis of SAE and the prediction of mortality was superior to S100B levels on day 1. Moreover, our study showed that S100B levels on day 3, but not S100B levels on day 1, were an independent correlation factor for SAE. In congruence with our results, a study showed that there was no significant difference in serum S100B levels in sepsis between the brain dysfunction group and the non-brain dysfunction group on day 1, but there were significant differences on days 2, 3, and 428. Overall, the results of this analysis showed that the serum S100B levels on day 1 were imprecise as biomarkers of sepsis brain injury.",

These factors could lead to the first S100B release peak. Transient elevation of S100B could accompany an increase in BBB permeability without brain injury43,44 or result from surgical tissue injury or renal failure. In the present study, there was a weak correlation between serum S100B levels and serum creatinine levels on day 1, but there was no correlation between serum S100B levels and creatinine levels on day 3. A study indicated that S100B from an injured skeletal muscle would fully normalize within 20 hrs, and the increased serum S100B levels can be used to reliably evaluate brain injury without continued muscle injury after 24 hrs45. Therefore, S100B levels on day 1 may not be a good indicator of brain damage and the dynamic detection of S100B can exclude relevant influencing factors. In our study, the incidence of encephalopathy was approximately 90% in the \u0394S100 + group and in 4 patients without encephalopathy. There were 3 patients whose S100B levels were below 0.115 \u00b5g/L on day 1, while the increase in the amplitude of S100B was less than 0.01 ug/L. Furthermore, the 180-day mortality rate was 74%, which was significantly higher than that of sepsis and the SAE group. By contrast, the incidence of encephalopathy was only 43.78% in the \u0394S100- group, and the mortality rate was also significantly lower. Just as lactate clearance can better reflect perfusion in septic shock patients compared to lactate concentration at a single time point, the dynamic changes in S100B can better reflect brain injury. Through regression analysis, we found that SAE was the main factor for the dynamic increase in S100B.",

Studies have shown that SAE has no specific structural imaging changes, except for some small lesions. These lesions cannot be detected effectively by CT scan; thus, MRI is required for their detection. However, MRI examination requires a long inspection time and cannot be performed at the bedside of the patient. Additionally, many types of medical equipments cannot be brought into the MRI examination room; thus, it is challenging to perform an MRI examination in the early critical state of SAE. Second, for economic reasons and exploratory research, we could only detect S100B levels on days 1 and 3 but not daily. Therefore, some vital information could not be obtained in the present study. Future studies should be designed to include multiple monitoring times and detailed kinetics of S100B. Third, although short-acting sedatives were used for sedation, 24 hrs may not be long enough for drug elimination in some patients and may influence the observation of the conscious state. Fourth, this is a single-center study and the sample size is relatively small; thus, the reproducibility of our results may be affected.
