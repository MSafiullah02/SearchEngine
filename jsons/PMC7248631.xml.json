Many COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization have symptoms indistinguishable from conditions such as pulmonary embolism (PE) [2,3]. To further complicate the clinical situation, many patients have D-dimer elevations and are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. Given the virulence of COVID-19, further radiological testing beyond chest radiography (CXR) is debated. In addition, there is no clear guidance as to whether anticoagulation should be initiated for emergency department (ED) patients with presumed COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer. We thereby present a patient who was found to have significant venous and arterial thromboembolic disease in the setting of COVID-19 infection.",

The CT scan also revealed a right ventricular (RV) filling defect concerning for thrombus, which was later confirmed on transthoracic echocardiogram (Fig. 3\n). Her CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no additional acute pathology. We initiated therapeutic unfractionated heparin and admitted the patient. Within 24 h, she developed worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia and received tissue plasminogen activator to treat her RV clot-in-transit and presumed PE.

While robust data are not available, and no formal guidelines exist, our case suggests markedly elevated D-dimer levels should raise suspicion for thromboembolism in patients with presumptive COVID-19. Studies show COVID-19-associated thromboemboli may develop in situ without distal thromboembolic origin [11,12]. This implies our patient's aortic thromboemboli, and possibly RV thrombus, formed in situ and underscores the increased risk of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients [11]. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommends prophylactic anticoagulation for inpatients with COVID-19 based on a study showing inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection (i.e., respiratory rate \u2265 30, arterial oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at rest, and/or PaO2:FiO2 of \u2264300 mm Hg) along with a D-dimer of at least 6\u00d7 the upper limit of normal benefitted from low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [[16], [17], [18]]. While the ISTH recommends prophylactic anticoagulation in inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, there is likely a subset of patients with clinically significant thromboembolic disease such as PE, proximal DVT, and arterial thrombus who would benefit from therapeutic anticoagulation.",
