Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Materials: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. Results: In 2018, out of a total of 9,578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3,081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan.",

Although the virus infects individuals of all ages, epidemiological reports demonstrate that older age is a significant contributing factor for symptomatic presentation, severe disease course, and death [1] . This is illustrated by the significant increase in case fatality rates (CFR) with age. In China, the CFR of the general populace is 2.3% with rates skyrocketing to 8.0% and 14.8% in patients 70-79 and over 80, respectively [2] . In Italy, reports of case fatality are even higher, with 8.6% in individuals 60-69 years, 12.8% in individuals 70-79 years, and 20.2% in individuals over 80 years [2] .",

Due to the vast diversity in diagnostic and operative procedures performed on the upper airway within ENT, there is a high risk of aerosolization, leading to the potential for transmission of high viral loads to the provider [8] . The director of an intensive care unit in Wuhan, China commented that Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists were infected at higher rates when compared to other doctors in the same hospitals, and the same trends are reported in Europe [9] .

These states will likely continue to be vulnerable with anticipated rises in case volumes or in the setting of a COVID-19 re-emergence.",

The resulting dataset included the number of total ENTs per state, the number of ENTs older than age 60 by state, the proportion of ENTs older than age 60, and the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau state populations. We subsequently calculated the ratio of state population per ENT provider for each state by dividing the total state population by the total number of ENTs for that state. Next, we obtained coordinates of all confirmed COVID-19 cases from a disease-specific data repository published by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)[12]. Both datasets were then imported into the geospatial mapping software QGIS (version 3.12.1), and superimposed onto state boundary files published by the U.S. CensusBureau.The percentage of ENTs above age 60 variable was used to group states into discrete quintiles with a graded color scheme for each quintile. Similarly, a logarithmic scale of confirmed COVID-19 case numbers was deployed to adjust the size of all coordinate data points to create a heat map demonstrating the distribution of ENTs over 60 years and the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. Determination of states with the highest risk for older otolaryngologists was assessed by dividing the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by the total number of otolaryngologists over the age of 60. of ENTs over 60 in each state was totaled and average over all of the states within each U.S. census region (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West). A one-way ANOVA was performed to analyze statistical differences in the average proportion of ENTs over 60 across each census region.The present study was considered exempt from the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center IRB approval process (Study 20200433).",
