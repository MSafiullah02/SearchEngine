Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections.

Given this situation, there is an urgent need to predict the development of the epidemic. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government took actions rapidly [1] . They restricted the traffic, extended the Spring Festival holiday, and even closed Wuhan and other cities in Hubei. These measures are actually double-edged swords. If the measures are not strong enough, the virus transmission will become more difficult to control. Under this circumstance, measures such as traffic control and regional closures are believed to have positive impacts on controlling the epidemic. However, the national economy may be impacted negatively. Thus, some industries may be negatively impacted. Therefore, studying and quantifying the effect of official policies can help us better understand these policies and prepare for the future.

Therefore, we assume that the diagnosed patients will be immediately quarantined into the hospital, and then they will not be able to infect others. Secondly, since there is no reported reinfection right now, we assume that the cured patients will not be reinfected and will no longer have the ability to spread the disease.

According to the statistics recently collected [6] , the length of incubation period is three days. The people in the infection period are those who have undergone the incubation period. People in the infection period show obvious symptoms, so they will be quarantined in the hospitals immediately and be not able to infect the healthy. Since different patients get different therapeutic effects in the process of hospital treatment, some people in the infection period will die and others will survive, which corresponds to the state of recovery from COVID-19 and the state of death due to COVID-19.

In other words, the growth of the confirmed cases decreases the growth rate of people in the incubation period, which is called a feedback process. The qualification of the feedback process will be explained later. Figure 1 shows the transformation process of the infected population in different stages with the feedback process, which is the basic idea of CIRD-F model.

The subscript i represents the ith day after 23 January 2020, and T is the maximum value of i. What needs to be emphasized here is that F is a feedback function. The meanings of the five equations are explained as follows. As to the first equation, F is impacted by n R , n D and n I together. Here, we set n I + n D + n R = n T , where n T is the number of the total infections (cumulative infections). With the increase of the total number of infected people, we believe that the government will take more stringent measures to control the epidemic, and the people will have a deeper understanding of the epidemic. Therefore, with the growth of n T , F will decline, which represents that the infectious ability of disease in human society is gradually weakened. The second formula shows the law of population growth in the incubation period in unit time. Some people in the incubation period become confirmed patients (infections), and the ratio of this process is \u03b1. Some healthy people are still in the incubation period, which is directly affected by the infection index F . The third formula shows the increase in the number of diagnosed infections per unit of time. The proportion of people with a ratio of \u03b1 changes from incubation period to confirmed patients.

Since the epidemic in Hubei is much more severe than that out of Hubei, the government published a series of policies on 23 January 2020. If these policies were not published, the situation of the whole country would become as severe as that of Hubei. To simulate the above situation, we use the values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, a and b in Hubei and the initial numbers n C,0 , n I,0 , n R,0 and n D,0 in the whole country and solve the differential equations. The values of the parameters mentioned above are shown in Table  1 . Figure 6 shows the development of the epidemic if the policies were not published. As shown in Fig. 6 , the predicted number of cumulative infections greatly exceeds the actual number of cumulative infections, which means the control of the government is effective. If it is not controlled, there will be 131 594 (prediction interval, 124 655 to 139 350) cases of infection at the end of the epidemic. The comparison between the simulation and the current situation shows that official policies decrease the number of possible infections by about 68%.

The values of the parameters mentioned above are shown in Table 1 . The above simulation reflects the situation that Hubei acts like other regions in China.
