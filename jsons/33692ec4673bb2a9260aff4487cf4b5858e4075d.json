PS forms during the settling of wastewater by gravity in the primary settling tanks. Little decomposition occurs during primary sludge formation. Since most of the inorganic part of the wastewater is removed in the earlier grit removal process, the PS consists of mainly organic material that settles. The PS is about 1-2 % solids by weight. In the biological treatment part of the WWTPs, the biomass that forms in the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic zones of the process is settled in final clarifiers by gravity and returned to the beginning of the biological process so that it is not washed off. The waste activated sludge (WAS) is the excess part of the biomass that grows in this secondary treatment process. It has to be removed from the process not to increase the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (bacteria concentration) in the secondary process more than a fixed value. The WAS is about 0.6 -0.9 % solids by weight.",

Although Atakoy I and Atakoy II WWTPs have separate primary sedimentation tanks, they were in maintenance and primary sludge from these two plants could not be sampled. Waste activated sludge (WAS) grab samples were brought from all the eight (8) WWTPs listed in Table 1 . Pa\u015fak\u00f6y, Buyukcekmece and Terkos plants do not have primary sedimentation therefore, only WAS was sampled from these plants. Because a portion of the virus can be lost to the supernatant, both PS and WAS samples were grab samples taken before the sludges were dewatered, by gravity thickeners or by mechanical dewatering units. Although both sludge samples contain 98-99 % water, filtering the sludge samples caused frequent clogging of the 0.45 and 0.2 micron filters. Therefore, the protocol used in raw wastewater samples was modified for the sludge samples.",

Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous are removed through anaerobic, anoxic and oxic stages (A 2 /O process). After deep sand filtration and UV disinfection, the treated wastewater is discharged into the Riva Creek which joins the Black Sea.",

            "text": "Prior to viral concentration steps, samples were shaken at 4 o C at 100 rpm for 30 min to transfer viruses to the aqueous phase. Bacterial debris and large particles were removed from the samples by centrifugation at 7471G for 30 minutes at 4 o C (Hettich, Rotanta 460R, Tuttlingen, Germany). Then, 250 ml of supernatant was filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m and 0.2 \u00b5m to remove remaining particles. A 5X PEG 8000 Stock Solution was prepared by dissolving 100 g of PEG 8000 (Nordic Chemical Solutions, Norway) and 17.5 g of NaCl in 200 ml distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 7.0-7.2 and the solution was sterilized with 0.2 \u00b5m filter. Filtrate was mixed thoroughly with PEG 8000 (10% w/v) by shaking for 1 minute. The mixture was incubated at 4 o C at 100 rpm for overnight. Following to the incubation, the mixture was divided in six 50 ml falcon tubes. Viruses were precipitated by centrifugation at 7471G for 120 minutes at 4 o C (Hettich, Rotanta 460R, Tuttlingen, Germany). Supernatant was removed carefully without disturbing the pellets. Pellets of each falcon tubes were re-suspended with 200 \u00b5l RNA free water. 1 ml of virus concentrate was used for total RNA extraction and remaining concentrate stored at -80 o C. Total viral RNA was extracted with Roche MagNA pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit using Roche MagNA pure LC system (Penzberg, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. RNA were determined both qualitatively and quantitatively by Thermo NanoDrop 2000c (Penzberg, Germany).",
