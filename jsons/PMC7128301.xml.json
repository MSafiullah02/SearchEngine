Membrane based arrays may be in the format of line probe blots. The results of hybridisation between the bound probe and labelled sequences in the sample applied and tested are revealed by scanning or imaging the array surface. High density arrays, which may have thousands of individual probes per cm2, are referred to as microarrays. Arrays can be prepared in-house using one of the several arraying instruments available commercially. These will spot synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR amplicons onto glass slides at low or high density. Microarrays of oligonucleotides can also be synthesised on a silicon surface by photolithographic combinatorial chemistry methods similar to those used to make electronic chips. These microarrays on silicon surfaces are therefore known as \u2018DNA chips\u2019. An example is the Affymetrix human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antiretroviral drug mutation detection GeneChip which comprises a set of matched and mismatched probes designed to hybridise with protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences.",

The usual nomenclature for arrays is that the element bound to the solid phase is the \u2018probe\u2019, while the \u2018target\u2019 is in solution. This is in contrast to Southern or dot blotting where the \u2018target\u2019 is bound and the \u2018probe\u2019 is in solution. In both cases, though, the target is DNA or RNA sequences derived from the test specimen. The process of making and using an array is illustrated in Fig. 1\n, and a check list of requirements for an arraying project is given in Table 2\n.",

            "text": "How close is this to reality? In that it assumes the existence of a universal \u2018panviral\u2019 DNA chip, it is arguable that it makes little diagnostic or experimental sense. Pathological specimens, and viruses, come in all shapes and sizes and clinical judgement should be exercised to assess the probable causes of whatever condition the patient has, leading to an intelligent guess of which viruses to test for. It makes little sense, for example, to search for respiratory viruses in a gastrointestinal sample, or blood borne viruses in a throat swab. From this it follows that informed decisions need also to be made about which extraction protocol and amplification primers should be used. It seems likely, therefore, that rather than universal extraction and amplification methods and a panviral DNA, specialist chips will be developed for the diagnosis of similar clinical conditions. Prototypes of such chips are already in use in many laboratories, but there is still a long way to go before they become routine in the way of, for instance, diagnostic ELISA kits. It is also probable that just as automated serological methods are the province of commercial suppliers, diagnostic viral DNA chips and accompanying instrumentation will have to come from that source, because of their cost and the need for consistency and quality control. Research and reference laboratories will, however, be involved in much of the bio-technical development necessary before such commercially supplied chips become available. These laboratories will also need to develop and maintain their own in-house methods for confirmatory purposes, for detecting more obscure viruses, and to monitor the performance of commercial equipment.",

            "text": "Generic PCR tests are designed so that only one or two pairs of primers are necessary to amplify a target sequence from a range of related viruses, for example those from the same genus or family. To develop this type of test, regions of conserved amino acid and nucleotide sequence are identified in the target genome. This is accomplished through multiple alignment of genome sequences from as many strains of the virus as possible. Suitable conserved sequences are found in protein encoding regions (e.g. at the active site of the enzyme) or untranslated regions that fold up to form self-annealed tertiary structures (e.g. ribosome binding sites and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions of viral genomes). Generic PCRs have been designed in this way for a conserved region of the DNA polymerase gene of the herpesviruses and for the 5\u2032-NCR of the enteroviruses (Table 3). The primers for generic PCRs are often degenerate, having mixed bases at positions of redundancy in the target sequence, or they may utilise the base inosine at positions of maximum degeneracy (e.g. see, Clewley et al., 1998). The amplification reagents and thermal cycling conditions usually have to be empirically established for successful generic PCR.",

In a PCR for neurological viruses, this might include generic primers for amplifying herpesvirus and enteroviruses together with more specific primers for measles, mumps, rubella and West Nile viruses. In a similar manner to generic PCRs, multiplex PCRs require careful optimisation, and even then it is difficult to make them as sensitive as specific single primer pair amplification reactions. To attain sufficient sensitivity, it may be necessary to split any sample into several aliquots for amplification with selected subsets of the full range of primers. Thus either one complex or several simpler multiplex PCRs containing a mixture of generic and specific probes would be used to amplify and label DNA extracted from CNS or brain tissue.",

It would also have, if possible, a generic \u2018catch-all\u2019 probe so that uncharacterised herpesvirus sequences not recognised by the specific probes would not be missed.

As can be seen from that list, the viruses targeted were primarily, but not exclusively, respiratory tract pathogens. The microarray was initially validated using fluorescently labelled Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza 3, poliovirus 1, adenovirus 12 and rhinovirus RNA prepared from both infected and uninfected cell cultures. More in depth analyses were performed with RNA from different serotypes of rhinoviruses, as well as with RNA extracted from nasal lavage specimens from patients with common colds. The RNA was amplified to DNA and labelled using a random PCR procedure (Bohlander et al., 1992), a step that is essential if arrays are to be used successfully for the detection of pathogens of unknown or unrecognised sequence.",

Each rotavirus was identified by an average of nine different specific probes (for the clinically relevant G1 to G4 and G9 genotypes), which were spotted on glass (via an aminolink) in an ordered way. PCR primers in regions of VP7 common to all group A rotaviruses were used to make amplicons fluorescently labelled with Cy5-dCTP. One of the primers was biotinylated, which allowed separation of the two amplicon DNA strands by streptavidin binding. In this way the test sequence could be applied to the array as fluorescently labelled single stranded DNA. When tested with 20 rotavirus isolates, the expected correlation with genotype results determined by sequencing was seen. As with the influenza virus array, details of the routine use of the rotavirus array in a diagnostic laboratory environment have yet to be published.",

After synthesis of each oligonucleotide probe, it is tailed with dT residues enzymatically or conjugated with BSA, and bound to the membrane. The dT tail or BSA acts as a spacer between the solid phase and the bases of the oligonucleotide probe that are complementary to the target viral sequence. This target is prepared by a PCR in which a specific product is amplified with a biotin residue incorporated at the end of it through the use of a biotinylated primer. After denaturation into single stranded DNA by treatment with alkali, hybridisation between the probe and the biotinylated DNA strand is revealed by a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase colorimetric detection step.",

One of these is known as a line blot assay (LBA) and makes use of a 450 bp amplicon in the L1 region of HPV using a primer set called PGMY (Gravitt et al., 1998, Gravitt et al., 2000). This primer set is a mixture (pool) of 5 upstream and 13 downstream oligonucleotides. The other assay is known as a line probe assay (LiPA) and it uses primers called SPF that amplify a small 65 bp amplicon within the L1 region (Kleter et al., 1998, Kleter et al., 1999). The SPF primers are not a mixture like the PGMY primers, but are consensus primers based on highly conserved sequences. Both primer sets can detect similar numbers (25\u201327) of HPV anogenital genotypes. A comparison of these two methods has been carried out with a panel of 400 cervical scrapes and, although minor differences in the detection of some HPV types was seen, overall they were found to match and be equally suitable for diagnostic use (van Doorn et al., 2002). Either of these two assays could be readily adapted to a microarray format: the same oligonucleotides would be used but applied to glass slides rather than to membranes; the PCR products would be labelled with a fluorescent dye (e.g. Cy3 or Cy5); hybridisation would be using slide hybridisation chambers; and an array scanner and software would be used to obtain the results, instead of colorimetric visualisation.",

For this, the gold standard method against which they must be compared is sequencing of the amplicon. One evaluation of a line probe assay compared to sequencing was for detection of drug resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV-1. It concluded that for 40% of the specimens the line probe assay was insufficiently reliable for use on its own (Puchhammer-Stockl et al., 1999). One in five samples gave results that could not be interpreted so that the antiviral drug genotype had to be determined by sequencing. However, another study found that although there were some discrepancies in the results obtained by line probe assay, it was suitable for use in a clinical virology laboratory for HIV-1 antiretroviral drug mutation detection as an alternative to sequencing (Wilson et al., 2000). This latter evaluation also found the Affymetrix GeneChip, which detects mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1, to be a satisfactory method.",

            "text": "The Affymetrix HIV-1 GeneChip was the first commercial microarray offered for use in clinical virology. It was initially developed for genotyping the protease gene, and later also for the reverse transcriptase gene (Kozal et al., 1996). Evaluation of its performance compared to DNA sequencing has been done by several laboratories and, in general, it has been found that genotyping by the chip is highly concordant with sequencing (Gunthard et al., 1998, Hanna et al., 2000, Wilson et al., 2000, Young et al., 1998). The Affymetrix HIV-1 protease GeneChip consisted of a high density array of over 12,000 oligonucleotides made by light-directed combinatorial chemical synthesis on a glass surface (Lipshutz et al., 1999). This array of 15-base overlapping oligonucleotides was designed so as to be able to interrogate each position of the HIV-1 subtype B protease gene through the means of a set of four oligonucleotides differing only at one base position for each nucleotide of the protease gene. The target was prepared from HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR with primers bearing T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoters so that the amplicon produced by PCR in this way had these promoter sequences at each end. It could then be transcribed into RNA with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of fluorescein-labelled rUTP. After fragmentation of this RNA, it was hybridised against the DNA chip so that the pattern of hybridisation could be read out as the sequence of the protease gene. This is a powerful method which illustrates two of the challenges that arise in using oligonucleotide microarrays to fully characterise viral genes. Firstly, the design and synthesis of the full overlapping set of redundant oligonucleotides is technically difficult and beyond the resources of many clinical virology laboratories. Secondly, the sequences of the oligonucleotides used on the chip must be based on a single known sequence, in this case that of subtype B of HIV-1. This means that separate chips would need to be made for each of the other subtypes of HIV-1, for example for subtype C which comprises about half of all worldwide infections today. The more rapidly and extensively the target genome mutates, the more difficult it will be to design sequence specific oligonucleotide chips that are able to catch all of the genome variants that might be present in individuals as HIV-1 quasispecies or already prevalent in the community. Obviously, this is more of a problem for a fast changing genomic target like HIV-1 than for a slowly evolving one like HPV.",

One of the initial hopes for oligonucleotide microarrays was that they could be used for DNA sequencing by hybridisation (Southern, 1996). Although this has not been realised on large scale, small PCR amplicons (about 100 bp) can be characterised with arrays of all possible 8-mer oligonucleotides (a total of 4096 probes). The use of an array of this type has been described for detection and quantification of neurovirulent mutants in oral poliovirus vaccine (Proudnikov et al., 2000). A short sequence region of less than 100 bp was amplified from the 5\u2032 end of the poliovirus genome from vaccine preparations, labelled with Texas Red fluorescent dye and applied to a microarray containing 4096 chemically immobilised oligonucleotides. The pattern of spots that was observed following hybridisation and washing was characteristic for the sequence applied. In practice this meant that if there were as few as 10% revertants in the vaccine preparation they could be recognised. Further studies using microarrays bearing 9 or 10 base long oligonucleotides are needed to determine whether this approach is applicable for longer PCR products. The alternative to using microarrays of generic oligonucleotides for characterising virus stocks is to use arrays of strain specific oligonucleotides, and this approach is also being investigated for the analysis of vaccine-derived polioviruses, as well as for analysis of the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus (Amexis et al., 2002, Cherkasova et al., 2003).",

The applications of these two complementary approaches in microbiology have been reviewed by (Cummings and Relman, 2000, Kato-Maeda et al., 2001, Manger and Relman, 2000). The RNA expression of HCMV in cell culture in the presence or absence of cycloheximide or ganciclovir was analysed with an array of oligonucleotides representing HCMV ORFs made on glass slides (Chambers et al., 1999). Similarly, an array of 288 amplicons representing 88 HHV-8/KSHV ORFs was made on nylon membranes, and used to compare the expression of viral mRNAs during latency and TPA-induced lytic replication (Jenner et al., 2001). Other groups are studying poxvirus expression in this way (Laassril et al., 2002) (Evans, personal communication).",

This type of host cell gene array is most conveniently obtained commercially, e.g. from Affymetrix. To study HCMV infection, the role of cellular genes, before the onset of viral DNA replication, was analysed by hybridising labelled mRNA from infected cells to Affymetrix gene chips containing over 6600 human gene probes (Zhu et al., 1998). The level of 258 mRNAs was found to change by a factor of 4 or more. Similarly, the expression of mouse cellular mRNAs after infection with the paramyxovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, was analysed using an Affymetrix mouse gene microarray chip (Domachowske et al., 2002). Gene expression was compared in hepatocellular carcinomas induced by either HBV or HCV (Iizuka et al., 2002). Messenger RNA from HIV-1 infected T-cells was hybridised to 1500 cellular cDNAs to identify genes involved in T-cell signalling, subcellular trafficking and transcriptional regulation (Geiss et al., 2000). In the same manner, the effects of HIV-1 infection on T-cell transcription was examined using Affymetrix gene chips, and up and down regulation, that is differential expression of cellular genes, was observed (Corbeil et al., 2001).",

If this unique transcription pattern could be captured as a readout from an array it could be used as a diagnostic signature. Simplistically, this might be done by hybridising labelled cDNA/mRNA from PBMCs from a patient to an array of sequences representing human genes, giving an array profile diagnostic of a specific pathogen. The particular advantages of this approach, if successful, would be that only one sample would be needed for several pathogens, and that it would allow the detection of early and late infections and of uncultivable pathogens. In addition, it might be possible to infer time since exposure to the pathogen, if the transcription pattern were temporally characteristic (Cummings and Relman, 2000).",

Essentially these are immunoassays in a microarray format (Schweitzer and Kingsmore, 2002). A protein array has been described for ToRCH screening whereby Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV and HSV-1 and 2 antigens were printed on glass slides. The slides were first incubated with serum samples and subsequently with fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies. Human IgG and IgM bound to the printed antigens were detected by confocal scanning microscopy. Good concordance was obtained between the microarray results and those of ELISAs (Mezzasoma et al., 2002). A microarray of oligosaccharides on nitrocellulose has been developed for capturing carbohydrate-recognizing proteins, and it might be possible to develop this for viral diagnosis (Fukui et al., 2002).",

There are two ways of doing this, either by bioaffinity or by biocatalysis. Bioaffinity arrays involve the target analyte binding to a ligand immobilised on a solid phase (e.g. an oligonucleotide) and, instead of there being a necessity for detection of hybridisation of the probe and target by colorimetric or radioactive means, the hybridisation is detected by electronic means. This can be achieved via a transducer at the point where the probe is attached to the solid phase. This class of biosensors also includes hybridisation biosensors which rely on a conformational change induced by hybridisation, for example molecular beacons bearing quencher and fluorophore dyes. Biocatalytic arrays involve an immobilised enzyme being used to recognise the substrate of the enzyme, which is, in this case, the target of the array. A signal is generated when the enzyme catalyses a specific reaction because of the presence of the target in the analyte applied to the array. The reaction may be recognised either colorimetric ally or via an electronic transducer at the surface of the array.",

At the top is depicted the route from the virus of interest to the spotted arrays (herpesvirus and enterovirus particles are shown). At the bottom, DNA or RNA is extracted from samples, amplified and labelled with either Cy3-dCTP (green) or Cy5-dCTP (red). When applied to the array bearing the immobilised probes, the target binds to complementary sequences. An example of an array result is shown on the right: the green spots represent hybridisation of the probe only with target sequences labelled with Cy3-dCTP; the red spots represent hybridisation of the probe only with target sequences labelled with Cy5-dCTP; the yellow spots represent hybridisation with both target sequences.",
