In addition to avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury, CPAP optimizes the functional residual capacity of the lungs, splints the airways and diaphragm, and stimulates lung growth; these effects have the potential to minimize the risk for CLD.3 Multiple randomized controlled trials compared early use of CPAP to mechanical ventilation and did not show difference in the primary outcome of CLD.4,5 Consequently, the American Academy of Pediatrics considered it an acceptable practice to support premature infants with CPAP in the delivery room (DR) without routine intubation and surfactant administration.6 However, when these trials were analyzed collectively in a meta-analysis, the early use of CPAP demonstrated a marginal but statistically significant decline in the composite outcome of survival without CLD.7",

Significant variations in the incidence of CLD were reported among these trials despite recruiting infants with comparable inclusion criteria and using the same definition of CLD. In addition, the majority of these trials were not able to reproduce the success previously reported in anecdotal experiences. For example, in neonatal units experienced with the use of bubble CPAP (b-CPAP), very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants were reported to have oxygen requirement at 36 weeks in 4\u20136% of infants with combined mortality and CLD of 13\u221217%.8,9 However, in randomized trials, the combined outcome of mortality and oxygen use at 36 weeks was mostly around 30% or higher.10 Therefore, CPAP as a tool is not able to explain the wide variation in CLD among neonatal units. In fact, in a recent report, significant increase in long-term pulmonary morbidities were associated with increased use of noninvasive ventilation during infants\u2019 stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).3",

The bundle would include: (a) device-related guidelines: type of facial interface, the source of delivered CPAP pressure, the timing of starting and weaning off CPAP, the method of weaning CPAP, (b) bedside skills and competencies: positioning of the infant, maintenance of patent airway, keeping nasal interface in place and maintaining sealed respiratory circuits, and (c) nonpulmonary management: early fluid management, feeding practices, nutritional goals, and transfusion practices. We therefore described the components of this bundle of care in our experience and provided the outcomes associated with this overall bundle. This study was designed to achieve two goals: (1) distinguish between the CPAP bundle of care and the CPAP device, and (2) to set the precedence of associating a respiratory bundle of care, rather than a device, with clinical outcomes. We also compared our recent outcomes using this bubble CPAP bundle with contemporaneous outcomes from Vermont Oxford network to assess the effectiveness of this bundle of care. Consequently, future trials that will use CPAP would need to specify the exact CPAP bundle and practice guidelines used to ensure uniformity among participating units.",

Data were expressed in mean (SD) and median (IQR) as appropriate. Statistical significance was detected when p < 0.05.To examine the relationship between early respiratory management and outcomes: We further compared outcomes according to early respiratory management in DR and through the first 3 days of life.

There have been multiple theories to explain possible advantages for the use of b-CPAP compared to other types of CPAP. Bubbling at the expiratory end of the circuit generates a low-amplitude, high frequency pressure waves that varies according to the level and frequency of water oscillation; and could contribute to lung recruitment in premature infants.15 Although such explanation is biologically plausible, studies that examine lung recruitment with the use of b-CPAP compared to conventional CPAP are lacking. A single study showed improved oxygenation when using b-CPAP compared to ventilator-driven CPAP when randomly assigned to the same infant.16 Meanwhile, in the absence of studies to support efficacy of other CPAP methods to reproduce superior outcomes, it is wise to continue using b-CPAP only and not to assume that all CPAP devices are equal.",

The practice did not allow for a pressure higher than 6 cmH2O. Some studies associated the use of higher pressure (8 cmH2O) with a significant increase in the risk to develop pneumothorax.5 The greater incidence of pneumothorax with the use of 8 cmH2O pressure could be a marker that such pressure is higher than physiologic and would be concerning to impose trauma to alveoli even in the absence of pneumothorax. The pressure used in the DR was also 5\u22126 cmH2O without routine bag-and-mask ventilation or sustained positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in order to avoid harm to premature lungs. Animal studies have reported that inappropriately high pressure in the DR is associated with significant lung damage even when pressure was introduced for a few breaths.17 A recent trial on the use of sustained PEEP was discontinued due to lack of safety with potential harms with such approach.18",

            "text": "Infants were weaned off CPAP directly to room air and did not receive oxygen via nasal cannula. This is one of the major characteristics of the b-CPAP bundle. This practice guideline was initiated based on an animal study that showed increased lung growth with longer use of CPAP; the continuous distending pressure generated by CPAP was associated with increased lung volume, weight, cytoplasm and DNA contents in male ferrets after 2 weeks of therapy. This lung growth effect was not achievable after 1 week of therapy, which indicates that the stimulation of lung growth by CPAP requires time.19 In a subsequent clinical trial, weaning off CPAP prematurely with transitioning to nasal cannula was associated with a longer duration of oxygen use when compared to continuing the use of CPAP until oxygen is no longer required.20 A recent trial demonstrated the effect of extended use of CPAP on lung growth; premature infants that randomly received extra 2 weeks of CPAP had doubled their functional residual capacity when compared to controls.21 The use of nasal cannula early in the course of RDS is not helpful either. When compared to CPAP, the use of nasal cannula to support premature infants with RDS was determined to be an inferior therapy in a recent multicenter randomized trial.22 One of the troubles associated with the use of nasal cannula is the lack of pressure control; studies measured a wide range of pressure (0\u221214 cmH2O) in the pharynx of infants supported with nasal cannula.20 Some nasal cannula devices allow adequate heating and humidification, although many of them will display significant water rain-out that leads practitioners to use colder and less humidified gas. Relatively dry and cold gas can add to the reactivity of respiratory airway especially those with existing lung disease.23 In addition, the bundle includes a careful attention to the patency of nasal and nasopharyngeal airway through frequent suctioning. Upper airway suctioning could be a challenging task especially in the smallest GA categories \u226424 weeks; it has to be efficient to clear all secretions, gentle not to cause any trauma, and fast to avoid apnea and oxygen desaturation. Thus, bedside training and experience are crucial for the success of the bubble CPAP bundle. Based on the above, our cohort had some infants who received b-CPAP without O2 supplementation at 36 weeks. Based on the definition of CLD used in major randomized controlled trials and in benchmark reports, these infants were not classified to have CLD. Of note, the definition of CLD with O2 use at 36 weeks may not necessarily reflect long-term respiratory outcomes.",

It is plausible that the ventilator-associated inflammatory cascade may contribute, in addition to CLD, to retinal injury that leads to ROP. It has been recently recognized, in animal model, that mast cell activation is responsible for the abnormal neovascularization of the retina that leads to ROP; mouse strains lacking mast cells do not develop ROP when challenged with hyperoxia.24 Another explanation to the absence of ROP for several years could be the application of a tighter goal oxygen saturation range that possibly minimized episodes of hypoxemia.",

The study reported 16 years of experience, although the investigators noted possible changes in practice, other discrete modifications in management could have been overlooked during such long duration of therapy.
