            "text": "One of the most important aspects of the mucosal immune system in clinical medicine is its role in the development of obstructive airway disease. Although the mucosal immune system is undoubtedly crucial to the survival of humans, certain illnesses are probably a result of an inability to regulate selected components of the immune response occurring at mucosal sites, particularly in the airway. In contrast to recurrent bacterial pneumonia and repeated infections of the sinuses and middle ear cavities, which occur in individuals with immunologic deficits expressed at mucosal sites, wheezing and airway hyperreactivity induced by viral infections occur in individuals who are unable to regulate certain immune pathways but are otherwise immunologically intact. As a result of this disregulation, viral bronchiolitis in infancy and asthma later in life are associated by common and today well-recognized histopathologic features, including an exuberant inflammation of the lower airway mucosa. Although many inflammatory cells appear to be involved, this inflammatory response is quite unique because the airway mucosa is infiltrated by T lymphocytes of the T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype and by eosinophils. The composition of this cellular response is dependent upon the discrete target-cell selectivity of chemotactic molecules. Cytokines, chemokines, and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) generated and released by structural cells of the airways such as epithelial cells regulate the migration and activation of leukocytes and therefore play a crucial role in inflammatory processes of the lung.",

An estimated 28 episodes of lower respiratory disease caused by RSV occur for every 100 children followed through the first 12 months of life. Reinfections in the second year of life are extremely common and occur with substantial frequency at all ages (Glezen et al., 1986) . Therefore, although most individuals develop relatively mild symptoms at the time of RSV infection, certain individuals seem more prone to develop lower respiratory illness (in particular, bronchiolitis) at the time of RSV infection.The fact that bronchiolitis (as well as croup) can be seen with a wide variety of viral agents suggests that the development of these illnesses is not entirely specific to any feature of RSV but to a similar feature of a variety of viruses as well as to some unique host component.",

The incubation period is assumed to be at least 4-5 days, at which time the infected child develops symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and low-grade fever. In most patients, the illness resolves over 7-10 days, but in others the cough becomes progressive and eventually signs of lower respiratory tract involvement appear. At this point, secretions are profuse and contain 10 5 -10 6 infectious units of virus per milliliter of secretion (Hall et al., 1976) . In cases of pneumonia, descent of virus to the lower respiratory tract probably occurs as a result of aspiration. In the syndrome of bronchiolitis, whether disease is entirely the result of spread of virus to the bronchioles or occurs through stimulation of pathologic immune responses simultaneously is not yet clear. In any case, the child at this point manifests respiratory distress that may be severe. Nasal flaring, dyspnea, and retractions are noted, and auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and harsh wheezing. Otherwise, the child remains remarkably free of other symptoms. Fevers are usually not marked, and the child may be quite active despite the presence of moderate hypoxia, again suggesting that severe illness may be mediated, at least in part, by mechanisms other than progressive viral infection.",

An intense peribronchiolar infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells occurs, with considerable edema.

Local antibody responses, predominantly in the secretory IgA class, appear in the respiratory tract shortly after the onset of primary infection (McIntosh et al., 1979; Kaul et al., 1981) . In some studies (McIntosh et al., 1979) , viral shedding is terminated at about the time of the appearance of antibody in secretions. However in other studies (Kaul et al., 1981) , antibody is present at a time when substantial quantities of virus are still recoverable from the respiratory tract. Thus the role of specific secretory IgA antibody in termination of infection is uncertain. Although repeated infection tends to result in accelerated local antibody responses (Kaul et al., 1981) and reduced severity of illness, whether local antibody is responsible for protection is not clear. In one study of adults undergoing experimental RSV challenge, specific nasal IgA antibody titers did not correlate with protection against infection (Hall et al., 1991) . In other investigations (Mills et al., 1971) , neutralizing activity in nasal secretions apparently correlated with partial resistance to infection. However, subsequent studies (McIntosh et al., 1979) demonstrated that such neutralizing activity is not necessarily antibody. In summary, RSV-specific secretory IgA antibody present at the time of infection does not prevent reinfection but may reduce the degree of viral replication.",

In a study of adults experimentally challenged with RSV, preexisting titers of neutralizing antibody in serum (but not in secretions) provide some degree of protection against infection. A hyperimmune human antiserum against RSV has been prepared by plasmapheresis of donors selected on the basis of having high-serum RSV-neutralizing antibody titers. When infused on a monthly basis to infants at high risk of serious RSV infection, this compound reduced the rate of RSV-related hospitalization by 40% (The PRE-VENT Study Group, 1997) .Therefore, serum antibody, presumably appearing in the respiratory tract by transudation following infection with RSV, appears to be better associated with protection against detectable infection than locally synthesized IgA antibody. Nevertheless, even the highest titers of antibody in serum or respiratory secretions do not seem to provide absolute protection against RSV, because as many as 25% of adults can be infected despite very high antibody titers (Mills et al., 1971; Hall et al., 1991) .",

RSV-specific IgE antibody responses have been documented in respiratory secretions and sera of infants and young children undergoing natural RSV infection (Welliver et al., 1980 Bui et al., 1987; Russi et al., 1993; Rabatic et al., 1997; Aberle et al., 1999) . As with secretory IgA, IgE appears first bound to the surface of RSVinfected cells and later free in secretions (Welliver et al., 1980 . Higher concentrations of RSV-IgE were observed in infants with bronchiolitis in comparison with infants with upper respiratory illness alone Bui et al., 1987) . RSV-specific IgE titers in respiratory secretions were also associated with greater degrees of hypoxia at the time of acute infection, suggesting that both the form and severity of illness are partially determined by the magnitude of RSV-IgE responses. Histamine can be detected in both the respiratory secretions and plasma of infants with RSV bronchiolitis, further substantiating the role of immediate hypersensitivity responses in RSV infection. Leukotrienes, particularly LTC4, have been identified in the respiratory secretions of infants with RSV infection (Volovitz et al., 1988; Garofalo et al., 1991; van Schaik et al., 1999) . Although a direct correlation of the leukotriene content of secretions with severity of illness was not observed, these compounds may nevertheless contribute to the airway obstruction that occurs with RSV infection.",

Eosinophilia in peripheral blood is suppressed at the time of RSV infection, although the suppression is overcome somewhat in subjects with bronchiolitis, particularly males. It is possible that eosinophils present in the respiratory mucosa have degranulated at the time of RSV infection and were not replaced by the time of autopsy in the fatal cases. Thus, although eosinophils certainly degranulate in the respiratory tract during RSV infection, the exact role of eosinophils in RSV infection is uncertain, especially because some preliminary observations suggest that degranulation of eosinophils occurs only after lower airway obstruction has been established (R.C. Welliver, personal communication, 1998) . On the other hand, recent studies demonstrate that eosinophils exposed to RSV are able to secrete inflammatory cytokines (Olszewska-Pazdrak et al., 1998a) and, when cultured in the presence of RSV-infected airway epithelial cells, to release eosinophil cationic protein (Olszewska-Pazdrak et al., 1998b) .",

Reconstitution of RSV-infected mice with cytotoxic T cells that have been repeatedly stimulated with RSV antigen clears virus rapidly from lungs but results in enhanced mortality and increases histopathologic changes in the lungs (Cannon et al., 1988) . Whether similar events occur in humans is not known, but infants with RSV bronchiolitis have been reported to have peripheral blood lymphocytes that are more responsive to RSV antigen than similar cells from infants with upper respiratory infection alone because of RSV (Welliver et al., 1979) . In addition, recipients of an inactivated RSV vaccine developed evidence of cellmediated hypersensitivity to RSV after vaccination and subsequently developed enhanced lung disease when naturally infected with RSV (Kim et al., 1976) .",

In mice previously vaccinated with the formalin-inactivated vaccine that enhanced disease in humans, RSV infection causes increased expression of mRNA for IL5 and IL13 (Waris et al., 1996) . In humans, polymorphisms of IL4 genes have been associated with more severe forms of RSV-related illness (Choi et al., 2002; Hoebee et al., 2003) . However, stimulation of lymphocytes from RSV-infected humans causes the expression of mRNA for the Th1 cytokine IFNg primarily, little IL4 expression, and essentially no increase in IL5 or IL13 (Anderson et al., 1994; Mbawuike et al., 2001; Tripp et al., 2002) . This pattern is reflected in studies that measured cytokine protein in secretions of RSV-infected infants. In these studies, IFNg predominated, whereas smaller amounts of IL4 were detected, and IL5 and IL13 were only rarely detected in infants with bronchiolitis (van Schaik et al., 1999; Garofalo et al., 2001) . Although IFNg is the predominant cytokine present in bronchiolitis, there is some evidence that infants with the most severe forms of illness have lesser IFNg responses than those with milder forms of bronchiolitis (Aberle et al., 1999; Bont et al., 1999; Garofalo et al., 2001; Johnston et al., 2002) .

Transfer of primary or secondary influenza-immune splenic cells to mice infected intranasally with influenza virus results in significant clearance of virus from the lung and protection against death in the recipients. T lymphocytes represent the cell population primarily responsible for this immunity (Yap and Ada, 1978) . Evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection may be a reflection of the cell-mediated immune response in the lung. First, influenza virus replicates in and is released from the cells without causing cell death. Second, mice without functioning T cells develop extensive replication of virus in the lung with dissemination to other organs but develop minimal pulmonary infiltration following influenza virus challenge (Wyde et al., 1977) . In contrast, cytotoxic T cells appear in the lungs of immunocompetent mice at the peak of respiratory symptoms and when histopathology in the lung is most prominent (Ennis et al., 1977) .",

Nevertheless, MIP1a is required for induction of inflammatory responses in animal models of influenza virus infection (Cook et al., 1995) , and influenza infection of epithelial cells and monocytes results in the release of many of the chemokines described previously for RSV infection (Matsukura et al., 1996 (Matsukura et al., , 1998 Sprenger et al., 1996) .",

This implies either that very few cells become infected or that infected cells exfoliate quickly and are rapidly replaced. Nasal biopsies also reveal minimum to no changes in the number of inflammatory cells in tissue from infected individuals in comparison to preinfection samples (Fraenkel et al., 1994) . In contrast to these tissue samples, neutrophils are abundant in nasal lavage fluids obtained from infected subjects. The degree of upper respiratory symptoms correlates with the number of invading neutrophils, and with the release of kinins in nasal secretions (Naclerio et al., 1988) . However, it remains uncertain whether the magnitude of the neutrophil and kinin responses simply reflects the degree of inflammation or is actually responsible for the manifestations of illness. Mucosal biopsies from individuals with rhinovirus colds show modest infiltration with lymphocytes and eosinophils (Fraenkel et al., 1995) .",

This suggests that rhinovirus infection might provoke wheezing only in those individuals who are atopic. This would presumably occur by increasing the reactivity of the airway, so that the degree of obstruction following allergen exposure would be enhanced during acute rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus infection does not apparently increase the reactivity of the airway to bradykinin, which is a potent stimulus of sensory nerves. Therefore, the increase in airway reactivity induced by rhinovirus infection is probably not due to an increased exposure of sensory nerves (Grunberg et al., 1997a) .",

Each group is then challenged with ragweed antigen E by instilling the antigen directly into the lung via an endoscope. No change in pulmonary function (FEV1 or FVC) occurs in these individuals. However, the group infected with rhinovirus and challenged with allergen develops increased airway reactivity. More importantly, late phase asthmatic responses (LARs), defined as a fall in FEV1 occurring at 48 hours after allergen challenge, developed in the majority of individuals infected with rhinovirus, but not in the uninfected group (Lemanske et al., 1989; Calhoun et al., 1991) .

The degree of histamine release is greater than that accounted for by the allergen challenge itself (Calhoun et al., 1991) , suggesting that rhinovirus infection enhances the capability of inflammatory cells to release mediators following allergen exposure. Because the release of histamine, but not tryptase, is enhanced in these subjects, it appears that the primary effect of rhinovirus infection is on basophils recruited to the lung rather than mast cells resid-ing in the lung.

In this regard, although the defense against foreign organisms, such as viruses or bacteria, is mediated by innate and by specific acquired immunity, the effector phases of both natural and specific immunity are largely mediated by cytokines. These molecules operate in networks and produce a cascade of effects that contribute to the orchestration, development, and functions of the immune system. Cytokines such as IL-1\u03b1/\u03b1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, mediate and regulate inflammatory responses that are often associated with the immune response (reviewed in Arai et al., [1990] ). IL-1, as an example, can induce cytokine genes, protein synthesis, and secretion in a wide variety of cell types and increase the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and modulate other cell surface molecules that are critical for cell-cell interaction and leukocyte migration (reviewed in Dinarello [1992] ).",

The composition of this cellular response is dependent on the discrete target-cell selectivity of chemotactic molecules. Chemokines, a newly identified family of small chemotactic cytokines, regulate the migration and activation of leukocytes and therefore play a key role in inflammatory processes of the lung (reviewed in Oppenheim et al., [1991] ). Two subfamilies, the CXC and the CC chemokines, are defined by the splicing of the conserved cysteine residues that are either separated by one amino acid (CXC chemokines) or are adjacent (CC chemokines). IL-8 and growth-related peptide (GRO)-\u03b1 belong to the CXC family and are mainly chemotactic factors for neutrophils. However, members of the CC branch of the chemokine family such as RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, and eotaxin are chemotactic factors for monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, with virtually no activity on neutrophils. With regard to human T lymphocytes, RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MCP-1 have been shown to be specifically chemotactic for CD4+ T cells of the CD45RO+ memory phenotype (reviewed in Baggiolini et al. [1997] ). The chemokine receptor CCR3, which binds eotaxin, RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-4, has been found to be expressed by Th2 cells, but not by Th1 cells (Sallusto et al., 1997) . The expression of CCR3 by Th2 cells is also functional because both eotaxin and RANTES-induced intracellular Ca 2+ increase and chemotaxis by CCR3 + Th2 clones.",

Epithelial damage and loss of integrity are a recognized feature of asthma (Jeffery et al., 1989) and are thought to be associated with the increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness that is characteristic of the disease (Boushey et al., 1980) . In addition, during the last few years it has become clear that the epithelium, after contact with exogenous stimuli such as microbial infections, can actively modulate the local inflammatory and immune responses by releasing a variety of mediators and cytokines. In this regard, human airway epithelial cells appear to be a dominant source of CC chemokines including RANTES (Stellato et al., 1995) , MCP-1 (Standiford et al., 1991) , MCP-4 (Stellato et al., 1997) , and eotaxin (Lilly et al., 1997) , and, among the CSFs, of GM-CSF (Ohtoshi et al., 1991; Cromwell et al., 1992) .",

            "text": "Respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target of viruses that enter the airways. RSV infection results from inhalation or self-inoculation of the virus into the nasal mucosa followed by infection of the local respiratory epithelium. Spreading along the respiratory tract occurs mainly by cellto-cell transfer of the virus along the intracytoplasmic bridges (Hall et al., 1981) . This has led to our current view that recruitment and functional activation of eosinophils, basophils, and mononuclear cells in the airway mucosa play a key role in protective immunity as well as in the development of virus-associated wheezing during naturally acquired RSV infection. Active research during the past 5 years has led to the discovery of a number of cytokines, chemokines, and CSFs that are produced in vitro by virus-infected respiratory epithelial cells in both cell lines and primary cultures (Table 83 .3). IL-8 was the first cytokine that was demonstrated in the supernatant of influenza-and RSV-infected nasal, bronchial, and lung type II epithelial cells. Synthesis of IL-8 appears to be dose and time dependent, to require replicating virus, and to be primarily transcriptionally induced (Arnold et al., 1994; Garofalo, et al., 1996a) . Concurrently with the discovery of IL-8, a number of different laboratories have reported the presence of IL-6 in the supernatant of airway epithelial cells infected by RSV, rhinovirus, and influenza virus (Table 83 .3). The mechanism of IL-6 production in RSV-infected lung epithelial cells appears to be regulated by the autocrine release of IL-1\u03b1 and, to less extent, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Jiang et al., 1998) , cytokines with potent bioactivity in infected epithelial cell supernatant. In this regard, IL-1\u03b1 has been shown to enhance the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on infected pulmonary epithelial cells (Patel et al., 1995) .",

Because mice infected with RSV develop a lymphocytosis in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, which is predominantly CD8+ T cells Openshaw, 1989) , and adoptive transfer of CD8+ CTL causes hemorrhagic pneumonitis (Cannon et al., 1988) , the increased expression of class I MHC by respiratory epithelial cells during RSV infection marks the infected cells, and possibly neighboring cells that passively acquire released RSV peptides, for CTLmediated lysis and associated immunopathology. Thus, increased class I MHC mediated by IFN-\u03b2 and other inflammatory cytokines released in infected airway mucosa may be considered an important component of the immunopathologic response to RSV. However, IFN-\u03b2 may play an equally important role in the protective immune response to RSV by inhibiting or restricting viral infection (Merolla et al., 1995) and by enhancing expression of class I MHC on the infected cells and their lysis by RSV-specific CTL. IL-11, an IL-6-type cytokine, has been shown to be produced by A549 (type II lung cells) infected with RSV, parainfluenza type 3, and rhinovirus 14 .",

Similar findings using a bronchial cell line have been reported by another group (Becker et al., 1997) . With regard to the protein concentration, RSV-infected epithelial cells obtained from the distal portion of the bronchial tree (SAE) and type II cells (A549) produced significantly greater levels of RANTES than those from the major bronchi and the upper airways. In contrast to the widespread expression of RANTES in the infected respiratory epithelium, RSV induced the release of MCP-1 only from A549 cells.

Moreover, because the recently discovered CC chemokine eotaxin appears to be a potent and specific chemoattractant for eosinophils and Th2 cells, we investigated by Northern blot the expression of eotaxin mRNA in RSV-infected A549 cells. As shown in Figure 83 .2, RSV infection of A549 cells induced the accumulation of eotaxin mRNA with maximal accumulation at 36 hours postinfection (R.P. Garofalo, personal communication, 1998) . With regard to other cytokines with known activity on eosinophils, it is of interest that both RSV and rhinovirus appear to be strong inducers of GM-CSF by bronchial and lung epithelial cells (Noah and Becker, 1993; Garofalo and Ogra, 1996; Subauste et al., 1995) . These findings have important implications for the activation and enhanced survival of human eosinophils in the airway mucosa.",

Originally identified as a transcription factor that bound to the inducible enhancer of the IL-6 gene, NF-IL6 has been shown to regulate the promoter activity of other genes, including IL-8 and GM-CSF (Dunn et al., 1994; Stein and Baldwin, 1993) and acute-phase reactants angiotensinogen and serum amyloid A (Akira et al., 1990) . The expression of NF-IL-6 is controlled in a tissue-typedependent fashion. In the many tissues that express NF-IL-6 mRNA, such as the liver and brain, the protein is also produced. In the lung, however, a discrepancy has been noted (Descombes et al., 1990) . Although normal lung tissue is, in fact, one of the most productive sources of NF-IL-6 mRNA, the NF-IL-6 protein is almost undetectable. This observation suggests that tissue-specific factors are involved in the control of posttranscriptional expression of NF-IL-6. However, data from Brasier's group indicate that human alveolar type II epithelial cells synthesize the NF-IL-6 transcription factor in response to RSV replication (Jamaluddin et al., 1996) . RSV infection stimulates the translational synthesis of a single NF-IL-6 isoform comigrating with recombinant NF-IL-6 (amino acids 24 to 345). The induction of NF-IL-6 is independent of changes in NF-IL-6 mRNA and is associated with an increased rate of NF-IL-6 synthesis. Thus, the accumulation of NF-IL-6 after RSV infection is due to increased translation of the preformed NF-IL-6 mRNA. The mechanisms for enhanced translation of preformed mRNA used by RSV are contrasted with an effect of influenza virus infection in HeLa cells (Wada et al., 1995) . Influenza virus infection increased, rapidly and transiently (over 2-4 hours), the DNA-binding activity of preformed NF-IL-6 protein without changing its steady-state levels. That this effect could be reproduced by double-stranded RNA left the suggestion that double-stranded RNA kinase could be an important virus-inducible activator for posttranslational activation of NF-IL-6 DNA-binding activity. Thus, NF-IL-6 activity appears to be inducible by several distinct posttranslational mechanisms by viral infection within the same epithelial cell type.",

            "text": "As shown previously (Table 83 .3), in vitro studies have shown a dramatic production of IL-8 by airway epithelial cells on RSV infection through an incompletely characterized mechanism involving enhanced gene expression. Thus, using the model of lung type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549) to study the initial events in viral-induced regulation of gene expression, we have investigated the mechanism for IL-8 induction by RSV infection. Infection with sucrose purified RSV produced a time-dependent increase in transcriptional initiation rate of the IL-8 gene. Transient transfection of the human IL-8 promoter mutated in the binding site for NF-\u03baB demonstrated that this sequence is essential for RSV-activated transcription (Garofalo et al., 1996a) . Gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated RSV induction of sequence-specific NF-\u03baB binding complexes. NF-\u03baB is a transcription factor superfamily composed of NF-\u03baB1, NF-\u03baB2, Rel A-, and c-Rel proteins that heterodimerize in cells expressing them, producing complexes with various transcriptional activity and subtle sequence-specific binding preferences. For this reason, we also tested whether the inducible complexes cross-reacted with specific antibodies for various NF-\u03baB subunits in the EMSA. These complexes were supershifted only by antibodies directed to the potent transactivating subunit Rel A. Both Western immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that cytoplasmic Rel A in uninfected cells localized to the nucleus after RSV infection. Rel A activation requires replicating RSV because neither viral conditioned medium nor UV-in-activated RSV were able to stimulate its translocation. Other laboratories have demonstrated an increase in NF-\u03baB DNAbinding activity following RSV infection (Bitko et al., 1997; Fielder et al., 1996; Mastronarde et al., 1996b) , and a simultaneous increase in the nuclear abundance of the potent transcriptional activator Re1A (Bitko et al., 1997) .This event appears to be essential not only for IL-8 but also for the activity of a genetic network including the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and IL-11 in RSV-infected epithelium (Bitko et al., 1997) . Moreover, NF-\u03baB activation has been reported as a consequence of Sendai virus infection of fibroblastic and renal carcinoma cells (Garoufalis et al., 1994) and rhinovirus infection of alveolar epithelial cells . The kinetics of Rel A activation in response to RSV infection occurs slowly, requiring 3-12 hours before significantly detectable NF-\u03baB protein can accumulate in the nucleus (Garofalo et al., 1996a) . This contrasts with an extremely rapid NF-\u03baB activation in response to hormone receptors (such as TNF-\u03b1) where NF-\u03baB is activated within minutes and the intermediate activation observed during rhinovirus infection . Other investigators, using nonpurified viral preparations, have shown a biphasic effect for NF-\u03baB activation (Fielder et al., 1996; Mastronarde et al., 1996b) , where an initial transient, replication-independent increase in NF-\u03baB binding is seen 30-90 minutes postinfection, followed by a nadir and a gradual reaccumulation after 24 hours. These differences in NF-\u03baB kinetics, as well as in the pattern of cytokine and other inflammatory gene expression, may be due to the contamination of the nonpurified viral preparations with NF-\u03baB activating cytokine activity such as IL-1, known to be produced by human epithelial cells routinely used for RSV and other respiratory virus growth. Our observations imply that although NF-\u03baB activation may be a final common pathway for both infectious and inflammatory signaling, this event is mediated by distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms. During RSV infection, we note that the kinetics of Rel A activation coincide with the production of viral antigens. This time course and the obser-vation that both NF-\u03baB and IL-8 production do not occur in response to exposure to RSV-conditioned medium or to UVinactivated virus argues that the process of active viral replication may be necessary to trigger NF-\u03baB binding and subsequent IL-8 synthesis. Indeed, viral products of replication such as free radicals (Schreck et al., 1991) and doublestranded RNA (Visvanathan and Goodbourn, 1989) are potent activators of NF-\u03baB in certain cell types. It is interesting to speculate that the expression of one or more viral gene products may be responsible for activating Rel A translocation (Fig. 83.3) .",

Infection of alveolar type II epithelial cells by RSV results in the rapid synthesis (within 3 hours) of NF-IL6, a basic domain-leucine zipper-containing transcription factor. In addition, RSV infection results in the activation of NF-\u03ba\u03baB (i.e., Rel A DNA binding) that begins at 3 hours and peaks at 24 hours and that involves proteolysis of the I\u03ba\u03baB\u03b1\u03b1 inhibitor via a still unknown and (largely) proteasome-independent pathway. Cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of ReIA and binding of ReIA and NF-IL-6 to regulatory consensus sites within the promoters of cytokine, adhesion molecules, or other inflammatory genes are responsible for their transcription. The role of specific RSV protein in the translational regulation of NF-IL-6 and in the activation of NF-\u03ba\u03baB is currently unknown. vRNA, viral RNA; 1C, 1B, N, P, M, 1A, G, F, 22K, L identify the 10 RSV proteins. systematically investigated the mechanism and kinetics of NF-\u03baB activation in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells in comparison to TNF-a (Jamaluddin et al., 1998) . In contrast to the rapid activation of Rel A produced by TNF-\u03b1, RSV infection produces a gradual increase in Rel A binding peaking at 24 hours. For both activators TNF-\u03b1 and RSV, I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b2 proteolysis occurred in parallel with the increases in Rel A DNA-binding activity. Specific proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, MG-132, and ZLLF-CHO significantly blocked 26S protease activity and I\u03baB\u03b1 proteolysis induced by TNF-\u03b1. However, although total proteasome activity in RSV-infected cells increased by twofold and its activity was almost completely inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors, they did not prevent I\u03baBa proteolysis by RSV infection. These data indicate a major component of I\u03baB\u03b1 proteolysis occurs via a proteasome-independent mechanism in viral-infected epithelium.",

The mechanisms of RSV-induced airway disease and its the long-term consequences are largely unknown, but the delicate balance between immunopathology and immunoprotection in the airway mucosa may be altered by an exuberant and unwanted local inflammatory response. Massive infiltration of mononuclear cells and activation of eosinophil and basophil leukocytes has been shown to correlate with the severity of acute RSV disease in both human and animal models. Inflammatory cytokines and CC chemokines with discrete target-cell selectivity for eosinophils and Th2 cells are strongly induced to express in RSV-infected respiratory epithelium. We propose a cohesive hypothesis that links RSV, and perhaps other respiratory viral infections, to the development of respiratory allergic disease, in which the inducible production of CC chemokines by RSV is regulated by intracellular pathways and signaling mechanisms characterized by the increased rate of NF-IL-6 synthesis, cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the potent transcription factor NF-\u03baB leading to the transcriptional induction of CC chemokine genes. The secretion of CC chemokines, including RANTES and eotaxin by respiratory epithelial cells, in combination with Th2-derived cytokines, is the central pathogenetic event in airway mucosa inflammation, sensitization to bystander antigens, and augmentation of allergen-induced Th2 cell recruitment. Moreover, pattern and absolute levels as well as relative concentrations, together with the kinetics of release of epithelial cell chemokines in different areas of the respiratory tract, are all factors that may significantly contribute to the various histologic and inflammatory features of RSV-induced airway disease. Selective production of MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and the severalfold higher amount of RANTES released by epithelial cells of the small bronchioles and lung in comparison to bronchial or upper airway epithelium, along with autocrine and paracrine mechanisms of amplification may largely explain the findings of mononuclear cell infiltration, eosinophil and basophil migration, and activation. Future studies, both in children with different forms of RSVinduced airway disease and in animal models, are needed to correlate the different parameters of histopathology, inflammation, and immune response with the expression and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and CSFs in airway mucosa.",
