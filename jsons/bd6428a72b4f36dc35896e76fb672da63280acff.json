The most important limitation of this study is our small sample size. Even in our predetermined analysis of six cytokines strongly associated with cytokine storm, we lack power to detect minor differences between groups. The exploratory analyses of an additional 70 cytokines is similarly limited, but is provided as a reference for the field. In addition, we do not have measurements of cytokines over time, but only near the point of enrollment. Finally, as discussed above, we report cytokine levels by MFI per recommended Luminex analysis methods, 10 precluding direct comparison of our values to previously published data that report cytokine levels in pg/mL.

Briefly, the Stanford ICU Biobank recruits patients at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS admitted to Stanford Hospital as previously described. 11 Subjects are eligible for enrollment when decision to admit to ICU is made, either from the Emergency Department or the hospital wards, with goal enrollment in <24h of ICU transfer. All 28 patients were phenotyped for ARDS and sepsis by 2-physician consensus (AJR and JEL), based on the Berlin Criteria and Sepsis-2 criteria and using all available hospital clinical data including history, physical exam, laboratory and microbiologic data, invasive monitoring data, autopsy results, and physician summaries. The Stanford ICU is a major referral center for cancer and thus typically has high rates of immunosuppression. To assess cytokine response to infection in patients with a normal immune system (similar to the COVID population), the ARDS and sepsis patients were therefore enriched for normal baseline immune system (e.g. no metastatic cancer, bone marrow transplant, or high dose steroids) in comparison to the Biobank as a whole.",

Each sample was normalized according to methods used by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. 12 Briefly, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each cytokine was corrected first for plate/batch/lot artifacts by linear mixed modeling, then the average of technical replicates was log transformed. Then the log transformed average MFIs were corrected for nonspecific binding by local polynomial regression and repeated cross-validation, resulting in plate-detrended MFI (dpMFI) values.

Broad testing of immunosuppressive therapies in unselected COVID-19 patients may therefore face the same fate as trials of immunosuppression in unselected ARDS and sepsis patients: inconclusive results despite decades of effort, and the uncomfortable understanding that while some patients may have been helped, others may have been harmed. Indeed, given the duration of mechanical ventilation and attendant high rates of nosocomial infection in severe COVID-19 patients, these therapies have potential for harm. Further research is needed to characterize the spectrum of the immune response in COVID-19, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from (and least likely to be harmed by) immunomodulatory therapies.All rights reserved.
