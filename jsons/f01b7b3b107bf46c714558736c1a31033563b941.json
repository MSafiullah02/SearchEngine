The importance of HRV in this setting has been a consistent finding over time in studies using culture or molecular methods [1] [2] [3] . Overall reported prevalence of HRV infections in children, an important cause of pediatric outpatient and inpatient disease, has been markedly higher in the last decade, due to the use of sensitive molecular methods and the recent identification of HRV-C, a species of HRV previously missed by culture-based studies [4] . The clinical significance of HRV, including newly identified HRV-C species, has been a source of ongoing debate. HRV is often regarded as a cause of mild, self-limited illness. Previously reported detection of HRV in high proportions of asymptomatic individuals [5] [6] [7] [8] also presents challenges in determining the role of this virus in causing acute infection. Repeated sample collection is needed to determine if asymptomatic HRV detections are from subclinical illness or due to continued shedding from a previous, resolved illness.",

This variation leads to frequent heterotypic reinfection in individuals, even within the span of a single respiratory illness season [3, 11, 12] .

We also identified frequent infections with the recently characterized HRV-C and a high prevalence of all HRV species among asymptomatic children. This study adds to previous literature describing HRV spread among children based on culture-confirmed infection by providing more sensitive detection and molecular subtyping of HRV in this population. Based on our finding of multiple HRV genotypes evident during the course of a single respiratory illness, the use of sequence-based HRV type determination is critical in longitudinal studies of HRV epidemiology and transmission. HRV-C cannot be detected by culture and for that reason has only been described in recent years following the introduction of molecular detection methods. Infection with HRV-C has been associated with more-severe lower respiratory tract illness in children compared to HRV-A [15, 18] ; however, this finding has not been consistent across studies [19, 20] . The majority of previously conducted comparative studies of HRV-C are among children or adults presenting for ambulatory or hospital-based medical care [15, 18, 20, 21] . In contrast, our study used prospective, active surveillance in a community childcare setting to examine instances of mild to moderate respiratory illness. In this context, we found few differences by HRV species in our analysis, including no differences in fever or healthcare visits and no evidence of increased cough or wheezing among children with HRV-C. A substantial proportion of children with HRV-C were reported to have decreased activity levels during their illness compared to children with HRV-A (40% vs 27%, respectively); however, this did not result in increases in missed childcare or parental absenteeism from work.",

HRV-B prevalence among asymptomatic children was notably higher (10/32; 31%) than among symptomatic children. This may indicate that HRV-B is less likely to cause clinically significant respiratory illness than HRV-A or -C infections. This finding corresponds with other studies, including a study in patients with HRV illness that found no cases of HRV-B among 22 children [22] .

Our results agree with previous studies detecting HRV through RT-PCR, which have similarly detected HRV in 12%-35% of asymptomatic children [5, 23, 24] . Our high rate is unsurprising in this setting given the frequent detection of HRV overall, and the fact that we have documented year-round exposure to HRV in the childcare centers included in the study. Previous studies have shown high rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission between individuals with previous exposure to HRV such as older children and adults [25] . It is likely, given the frequent overall exposure to HRV in childcare attendees, that rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission are high in this setting as well. This high rate of detection of HRV among asymptomatic children, coupled with the frequent coinfection with other viruses observed here, highlights the difficulties with determining the role of HRV in causing the common cold. Even though decades of human challenge studies have demonstrated that experimentally administered rhinovirus results in upper respiratory symptoms and transmissible disease, it is nevertheless difficult in observational studies to determine causation following a molecularly detected HRV. While not possible in the context of our study, evaluations of host response [26] [27] [28] to both HRV infection and especially HRV coinfections may present a way forward in understanding this complex system, as it has with studies of the microbiome. We were able to assess the extent to which persistent HRV shedding may be present in children following illness resolution through our sampling collection protocol. In this protocol, collection continued until symptoms were no longer worsening and until swabs were negative by PCR, allowing us to follow HRV infections to resolution. From a total of 92 illnesses in 91 children with HRV sequence data available, only 4 children had repeated detections of the same genotype for longer than 2 consecutive weeks. In contrast, we identified 7 illnesses in which 2 different HRV genotypes were detected within the span of a single illness episode. Similar to other studies, we found that rhinovirus RNA was no longer detected in the nasal tract within 2-5 weeks following onset of infection.",

However, in 2 specific instances, continued circulation of individual strains with 100% sequence identity showed evidence of person-to-person transmission within and between individual classrooms. In our study, 1 repeatedly detected strain showed genetic similarity to HRV-A12, and 1 had an undefined genotype that was identical between infected children but not within 95% homology of any previously identified genotype in the database [10] . Interestingly, HRV-A12 has been previously identified as a long-shedding strain by a prospective study of HRV infections in healthy young children [29] . Similar patterns of a limited number of apparent highly transmissible strains responsible for a disproportionately high number of infections have been documented in historical studies of HRV epidemiology [3, [30] [31] [32] [33] . However, even these high-prevalence strains do not remain consistent from year-to-year or between populations, complicating efforts to ultimately identify consistent targets for future vaccine efforts.",

Group childcare allows numerous opportunities for contact between children with contaminated fomites (ie, toys), providing many pathways for the transfer of aerosolized virus and respiratory secretions. Environmental surveillance studies have found rhinovirus on toys in childcare centers [34] , but trials of environmental cleaning have had mixed success in reducing respiratory illness overall in childcare [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Despite the frequency of missed childcare and lost parental work incurred by all HRV types in this study, effective strategies to reduce transmission of this virus remain scarce. Our findings are limited by a number of aspects inherent in the study design. Asymptomatic sampling was only conducted during and directly following enrollment. Given the high prevalence of asymptomatic HRV observed, more in-depth asymptomatic testing at regular intervals throughout the respiratory season would be of interest. Secondly, the weekly sampling schedule limited our ability to precisely define HRV shedding duration, given that most HRV infections cleared before the second testing point around day 7. Nevertheless, the duration of genotype-specific HRV detection observed here is notably shorter than other common, frequently asymptomatic respiratory viruses such as AdV and HBoV [5, 13, 40] .",

Although our use of weekly sampling allowed us to define the strain-specific duration of HRV in new detail, our finding that most HRV infections last 2 weeks or less indicates that studies with more frequent sampling are needed to fully define the dynamics of naturally occurring rhinovirus infection in young children. This finer level of detail will ultimately be required to describe the transmission networks of HRV in high-prevalence settings, such as childcare or group living environments. As efforts continue to develop HRV vaccines, molecularly informed data on HRV infection, persistence, and transmission will be needed to inform vaccine development and intervention strategies.",
