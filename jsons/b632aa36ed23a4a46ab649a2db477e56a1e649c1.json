Aim: To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OAS-1 and its relationship with the disease status of HCV infection. Methods: Six SNPs of OAS-1 were selected and examined in 409 Japanese patients with chronic HCV infection using the TaqMan PCR genotyping method. The relationship of SNP genotypes and clinical manifestations of patients was analysed. Then, a pair of OAS-1-expression plasmids mimicking the clinical-related SNPs were created and transfected into liver cells carrying the HCV subgenomic replicon or the full-length genome, JFH1, and HCV replication after transfection was compared. Results: Patients with genotypes A/A, A/G and G/G of an SNP of OAS-1 at the exon 3 of its coding sequence were at gradient increased risks of suffering from higher serum alanine aminotransferase (P o 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.001), higher degree of liver fibrosis (P = 0.010) and higher presence of liver cirrhosis (P = 0.001). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, genotype G/G was an independent factor associated with cirrhosis (P = 0.013, odds ratio 3.11, 95% confidence interval 1.27-7.63). In liver cells, OAS-1 with the G allele showed lower ability to inhibit virus replication than OAS-1 with the A allele (P = 0.004). Conclusions: The SNP of OAS-1 at the exon 3 of its coding sequence was associated with progression of disease in Japanese patients with HCV infection.",

After binding with doublestrand RNA (dsRNA), it catalyses the formation of 2 0 -5 0linked oligoadenylate and activates RNaseL, which breaks down viral RNA (11, 12) . An SNP of OAS-1 had been reported to be related to sustained infection of Caucasian hepatitis C patients (13) . Another SNP of OAS-1 was reported in another study to be related to development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, a coronavirus infection) (14) .

The percentage of residual HCV replicon after transfection of the G-type plasmid was higher than that of the A-type plasmid (P = 0.004), indicating a weaker ability of G-type OAS-1 in inhibiting the HCV subgenomic replicon. As for Western blotting, no difference in the quantity of OAS-1 expression was found between OAS-1/allele A and OAS-1/allele G (Fig. 3) , indicating that the difference of virus suppression was due to the quality of OAS-1.",

In fact, OAS-1 having a G allele in rs3741981 has a weaker ability in suppressing HCV replication compared with OAS-1 having an A allele. Thus, our results can be explained by the fact that patients with the rs3741981 G allele were weaker in suppressing HCV replication compared with patients with the rs3741981 A allele, which may lead to a higher degree of necrosis and regeneration, and ultimately fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. The OAS-1 gene, located on chromosome 12, has two major transcripts that are generated by alternative splicing at the last two exons. E16 (NM_002534) is a short transcript with five exons and is translated into p40 isoform. E18 (NM_016816) is a long transcript with six exons and is translated into p46 isoform (23, 24) . The A/G polymorphism in exon 3 of OAS-1 (rs3741981) causes amino acid substitution Ser162Gly in both isoforms, which is located near the dsRNA-binding domain (amino acid 104-158) of OAS-1 (25) .",

We tested this hypothesis using liver cells carrying the HCV subgenomic replicon or the full-length HCV genome. Transfection of the OAS-1 expression plasmid into cells harbouring the HCV subgenomic replicon of the fulllength genome (overexpression) resulted in inhibition of HCV, which was consistent with previous reports (30) . In our experiments, cells transfected with the G-type OAS-1 plasmid showed higher HCV replication compared with the A type. Therefore, patients with the rs3741981 G allele were weaker in suppressing HCV replication compared with those with the A allele. The higher transaminase level might be the clinical evidence. Increased inflammation eventually led to fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. The rate of fibrosis progression was believed to be higher among patients with higher serum ALT and AST levels, as reported by Ghany et al. (7) . Thus, by in vitro and in vivo study, we ratiocinated that G allele carriers had weaker virus clearance, which resulted in more inflammation, and then more fibrosis.",

The result of IFN therapy obtained by Knapp and colleagues is consistent with our study. It is interesting that previous papers reported an increase of OAS-1 protein expression in persistent HCV infection but not in exogenous IFN treatment (32, 33) .

Many statisticians consider that a 0.05 cut-off is inadequate for genetic association studies. They rather recommend a 0.01 cut-off to strengthen the value of the association. Therefore, our conclusion should be weakened to some extent. In fact, many genetic factors had been reported to associate with fibrosis/cirrhosis of the liver. Most reports were on cytokine polymorphisms. Polymorphisms of interleukin-10 and tumour necrosis factor-b were reported in many studies to relate to fibrosis (34, 35) . The association of the polymorphism of complementary 5 and fibrosis degree was also reported recently (36) . Patients with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 genotype G/G or G/A were more likely to have advanced fibrosis and severe inflammation in the liver biopsy than those (37) . The polymorphism of other genes such as the angiotensinogen gene has also been reported to be associated with more advanced fibrosis (38) . Patients with coagulation factor V Leiden mutation (A560G) were also more likely to progress to cirrhosis (39) . In another study on different alleles for the microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene, an important antioxidant enzyme, patients with cirrhosis were more likely to have the slow metabolizer phenotype of this enzyme (40) . It seems that many genetic factors can affect the progression of liver disease, involving different aspects of the liver such as immune, metabolism, circulation and so on. Therefore, in the future, many SNPs of a patient might be detected simultaneously in order to have a stronger prediction of the risk of developing significant liver disease.",
