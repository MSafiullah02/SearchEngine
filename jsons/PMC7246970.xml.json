In 2005, research conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that bats may be the natural reservoirs for SARS-CoV [2]. SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded (ss) RNA virus with a large RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb. SARS-CoV replicons consist of the genomic 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) and an open reading frame (ORF) encoding for the polyprotein(pP)-a, and for pP-ab containing the sequence for 16 non-structural proteins (from Nsp1 to Nsp16) that constitute the replication/transcription complex of the virus [9]. The remaining part of the SARS-CoV genome encodes four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and accessory proteins that may interfere with the host innate immune response [3].",

As the global scientific community is in the race for finding novel therapies for the disease, in late April 2020 over 500 interventional clinical studies on the current COVID-19 have been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [6]. While waiting for a preventative vaccine, most of the therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 are currently based on slowing down the virus replication (i.e. by using antivirals adopted for other viruses), and on reducing severe forms of disease (i.e. by counteracting the cytokine storm syndrome).",

The building blocks of G4s are assembled in G-quartets that are connected by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to form polymorphic structures. In general, all G4 structures exhibit a favourable thermodynamics, even if RNA G4s are more stable than DNA G4s [10, 11]. Although the frequency of G4-forming sequences (G4FS) vary significantly among evolutionary groups, they have been identified in all species. In human genome, putative G4FS (PG4FS) were found in various regions including sub-telomeres, telomeres, gene bodies, and 5\u2032 untranslated regions and other gene regulatory regions. This observation suggests that G4s are likely involved in the regulation of crucial biological pathways, such as replication and regulation of gene expression [9]. PG4FS sequences have been found not only in humans, but also in other mammalian genomes, bacteria, and, intriguingly, they were found also in viral genomes [12].",

Interestingly, ebselen is a selenium-containing compound that was tested in different Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials on patients with Meniere\u2019s Disease or in subjects affected by type1/2 diabetes (https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB12610). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial conducted in 83 healthy adults aged 18\u201331, demonstrated that ebselen treatment was well tolerated [30].

Moreover, as recently emerged from the work by Zhou et al. [8], the search and use of FDA-approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original clinical indication, currently known as drug repositioning, could be a promising approach to find a rapid strategy to limit the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In our opinion, the research on the G4s/helicase world could accelerate the finding of non-toxic effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV (Fig. 1), as well as for SARS-CoV-2, by the discovery of new G4 ligands rapidly transferable in the clinic, and by the employment of FDA-approved helicase inhibitors.",
