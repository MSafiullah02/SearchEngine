Historically, Nursing PhD curricula have included measurement or advanced research methods courses focused on the selection of appropriate design and methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis (Polit & Beck, 2016). Also, appraising the breadth and depth of instruments used in research has been a critical component of these programs, while utilizing methodology from the psychosocial sciences (Waltz et al., 2017). In such methodology coursework, students are guided on critically evaluating the adequacy of instruments, considering uncertainties in measurement, and examining sources of variability.",

In this era of precision medicine, Big Data, translational science, patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness research, formal advanced training needs to be provided to PhD students (Henly et al., 2015). There is also a growing demand for multiple disciplinary research teams to observe problems from different perspectives, develop more comprehensive research hypotheses, and solve complex problems more effectively (Choi & Pak, 2006). These recent trends towards producing applied science, i.e. research involving multiple disciplines is becoming increasingly appealing for funding agencies. The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) has been encouraging the integration of genetic or other biomarkers, and informatics in Nursing Science for the past 20 years (National Institute of Nursing Research, n.d.-a; National Institute of Nursing Research, n.d.-b). But, are PhD programs in Nursing preparing nurse scholars who can function adequately at the cutting-edge of science? To our knowledge, as of 2015, there has been only one study on Nursing PhD programs in the U.S. revealing that curricula do not sufficiently cover emerging areas in the sciences (Wyman & Henly, 2015). The amalgamation of new research methods in nursing studies, as per the NINR recommendations, will get students up to par for collaboration with other disciplines.",

The use of technology in research, such as in real-time data collection with ecological momentary assessment, informatics research and Big Data science can be studied. Measurement in health services-oriented research and interactive digital media may also be examined.

These individual experiences help shape the identity of the nurse scientist (Armstrong, McCurry, & Dluhy, 2017).

In further developing measurement coursework, additional emphasis could be placed on data produced by technologic enhancements in research. For example, considerations for the use of advanced statistical approaches to handle repeated measurements, and computational tools to facilitate recognition of meaningful patterns in data may be elaborated upon.",

PhD programs must be well-positioned to produce investigators who conceive, develop, and implement innovative initiatives in interdisciplinary contexts. Faculty need to be abreast of developments and to ensure the delivery of a curriculum that is at the forefront of science. In addressing a core aspect of the curriculum, it is essential to develop novel measurement coursework. Training students on measurement issues relevant to contemporary phenomena encourages them on unconventional thinking and interdisciplinary collaborations, and enhances state-of-the-science nursing research.",
