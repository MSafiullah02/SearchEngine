With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003, China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period.

A total of 107 clinical trials had been registered by Chinese researchers, of which 90 were registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register and 17 in clinicaltrials.gov by 14 February 2020. Almost all trials were investigator-initiated. Most of the trials involved clinical therapy and a small part of pathogenesis research and 87 trials were related to drug interventions. More than 20 trials were conducted in Wuhan, the most severely affected area (Figure 1). Most of them were shortterm clinical trials, with the planned study period of 1 to 11 months, and about a quarter of them were within 6 months. We used \"novel coronavirus AND China\" to search on PubMed website by 14 February 2020, and a total of 81 literatures for 2019-nCoV were retrieved after excluding the results like news and comments. Most of the literatures were focusing on the description of epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, while studies of diagnosis (imaging, nucleic acid detection) and treatment were limited. In terms of diagnosis, seven literatures were published in Radiology to conduct computed tomography analysis for more than 80 patients to summarize the imaging characteristics of NCP. 1 In addition, there were two literatures on nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV. 2 It should be noted that there was no shortage of institutions for nucleic acid detection and even a few of them had been approved by the government, however, the data to prove the sensitivity and consistency were still lacking. And the New England Journal published the first clinical evidence of tumor patients in the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, supporting that tumor patients may be more susceptible to infection due to the influence of malignant tumor, chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and other factors on immune status. 3 In terms of treatment, no successful randomized controlled trial (RCT) had been published, which also reflected the bottleneck of current treatment. In general, finding effective targeted drugs remains an urgent work. In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period 17 years ago, our capacity to conduct clinical trial on drugs was still relatively weak in China, and there was also a lack of awareness and registration conditions for clinical trials. We attempted to retrieve the registered trials during SARS period from the first patient infected with SARS-CoV in November 2002 to the complete end of the epidemic in July 2003, but failed. Therefore, only incomplete statistics based on literatures for SARS-CoV could be obtained. A total of 54 literatures of drug studies were retrieved, 4 of which 83% were retrospectively analyzed, with few prospective studies. The selection of the study drugs was similar to that of 2019-nCoV, with ribavirin, lopinavir, interferon, and glucocorticoids as the main drugs. Vaccine studies were also launched; however, the follow-up data were not reported. Compared with that in the SARS period, the ability and consciousness of carrying out clinical trials in China during the period of 2019-nCoV were significantly improved. Meanwhile, the quality of clinical trials and the level of evidence will provide important evidence-based data for the clinical diagnosis and treatment for 2019-nCoV.",

At the same time, the trials combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine occupied a high proportion. Considering that 2019-nCoV might cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), patients in the studies of traditional Chinese medicine could also receive Western medicine which was a very important therapy for them. Antiviral drugs still drew the most attention, 5,6 including remdesivir, ASC09, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, as well as the traditional biological agents such as interferon-alpha and thymosin alpha-1. At the same time, three studies for glucocorticoids were launched, and two of them recruited patients with severe pneumonia. In addition, the traditional antimalarial drugs-chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine-were also widely studied. It was encouraging that two important drugs registered clinical studies for NCP. As more and more evidence showed that the mechanism of severe pneumonia may be associated with CRS caused by virus infection, tocilizumab, which was the most effective way to inhibit CRS in the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, has been the focus of recent academic discussion. A multicenter RCT for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of NCP has been registered on 14 February 2020.

Therefore, the frequency and time interval of detection after turning negative need to be further discussed. If the frequency of detection is increased or the interval is prolonged, combined with the improvement of clinical symptoms, the disease progression could be more accurately estimated, and whether the patient still carries the virus and is infectious could be further determined.In addition, in a public health emergency, the race against the epidemic forces us to consider an earlier effective endpoint of as a surrogate endpoint for mortality to accelerate the process of clin-ical trials. For example, two studies of remdesivir (NCT04252664, NCT 04257656) used time to clinical recovery (TTCR) and time to clinical improvement (TTCI) as primary endpoint, respectively, instead of virus nucleic acid detection or survival status of severe patients. The former is based on the patient's body temperature, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and the improvement of clinical symptoms; the latter is based on the time for improvement of the clinical status. And given the relatively low mortality rate of about 2% for NCP at present, the choices of endpoint were based more on recommendations for influenza drug research, in which mortality is not the primary endpoint in most studies. Besides, TTCR or TTCI as a surrogate endpoint required smaller sample sizes than the other dichotomous endpoints (such as disease control rate). And it should be emphasized that the choice should be dependent on the opinions and decisions of the clinical medicine.",
