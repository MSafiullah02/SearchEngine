In addition to the medications listed for foals in category 2 (stable foal with clinical abnormalities), intravenous fluid therapy is the most important and life-saving measure in this situation. An isotonic crystalloid with an electrolyte composition similar to normal foal values is ideal. Normosol-R1 (or Plasmalyte A2) represents a safe choice for administration in the absence of laboratory values. It has a higher sodium-to-chloride ratio, compared with many of the other fluids, making it more ideal for foals that have had significant fecal sodium losses. A fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg should be administered rapidly (over 20 to 30 minutes, if possible), followed by reassessment of the foal.

Depending on the age of the foal and severity of disease, a rate of 3 to 6 mL/kg per hour is often used. Replacement fluids (i.e., Normosol-R) are often still used for this phase of fluid therapy because they are higher in sodium than maintenance fluids, and ongoing sodium losses can be substantial in affected foals. Urine production and, ideally, body weight should be monitored to ensure that the foal is not becoming fluid overloaded. Many foals with diarrhea develop metabolic acidosis secondary to severe losses of sodium and bicarbonate. Although it is not likely appropriate for bolus administration, isotonic sodium bicarbonate can be made by adding sodium bicarbonate to sterile water to create a fluid with a tonicity similar to plasma. This can be used in diarrheic foals that have ongoing sodium losses, but potassium and calcium are often also required as fluid additives.",
