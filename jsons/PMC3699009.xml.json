Our data indicates that rates and types of bacterial infections with non\u2013influenza viruses are similar to those observed with influenza. The high rate of mixed viral-bacterial infection identified in our study reflects the use of the serum biomarker PCT to augment comprehensive bacterial testing.

However, it is also noteworthy that 61% of hospitalizations involving viral infection had no evidence of bacterial infection. Most of these individuals had normal chest radiograph findings and were hemodynamically stable, yet 90% received a course of antibiotic treatment. Four deaths due to complications from C. difficile colitis occurred in this group. Once considered a nuisance, C. difficile colitis has now evolved into a deadly syndrome with high mortality rates and relapse rates of 20%\u201330% [29].

In 6 trials involving >2500 subjects with CAP or acute exacerbation of COPD who were randomly assigned to receive standard care or PCT-guided antibiotic treatment, there were no discernable adverse outcomes, and antibiotic use was significantly decreased, especially in those with nonpneumonic respiratory tract infections. In our study, serum PCT levels of \u22650.25 ng/mL correlated with radiographic pneumonia and higher severity of illness scores, which has been previously noted and is consistent with PCT level as a surrogate for invasive bacterial infection [30]. In addition, higher mean PCT levels were noted in patients who received a diagnosis of bacterial infections by a variety of methods, including blood and sputum cultures as well as pneumococcal urine antigen and serologic testing, suggesting that elevated PCT levels should heighten a clinician's suspicion for bacterial infection. However, PCT levels may not correlate as well with less invasive bacterial infections, such as bronchitis and acute exacerbation of COPD, and thus in some patients a low PCT level may not rule out the presence of bacterial infection [31, 32]. Although issues of bacterial colonization in this population complicate interpretation, examination of the sputum may continue to be important in patients with severe underlying lung disease.",

In addition, our results may not be applicable to all adults admitted with respiratory tract infections, since most illnesses in our study were not severe, as reflected by the low mortality rate. The inability to obtain consent from some of the most critically ill patients may have underestimated the rate of mixed viral-bacterial infections. Also, despite vigorous attempts to collect adequate respiratory samples in a timely fashion, we were successful in only 51% of hospitalizations, also leading to underestimates of bacterial infection. Conversely, it is also possible that bacterial infection based on results of sputum cultures overestimates the incidence of infection, as it is often not possible to distinguish chronic colonization from infection even with adequate samples. Last, the presence of viral RNA may not always be causally associated with the illness leading to hospitalization. Prolonged viral detection following respiratory tract infection due to rhinovirus and other viruses can been seen, particularly when using sensitive molecular diagnostic tests.",

At the present time, establishing a specific bacterial diagnosis on the basis of traditional methods remains difficult, and better bacterial diagnostic tests are needed.
