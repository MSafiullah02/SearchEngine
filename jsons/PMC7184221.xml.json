In health, about 75% of a normal-sized VC is expelled in 1 second (FEV1). The peak flow meter, which measures the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR; the earliest portion of forced expiration), is a simple measure of airflow obstruction, when the FEV1 is a much smaller fraction of the VC. In lung restriction, the diminished VC can be mostly expelled in about 1 second. Serial measurements (e.g. in asthma) provide valuable information about disease progress. The reversibility of airways obstruction is usually assessed by spirometry before and after use of a bronchodilator agent.",

Chronic bronchitis is defined as the excessive production of mucus and persistent cough with sputum production, daily for more than 3 months in a year over more than 2 consecutive years. It leads to production of excessive, viscous mucus, which is ineffectively cleared from the airway, obstructs and stagnates, and becomes infected, usually with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. Patchy areas of alveolar collapse can result. Emphysema is dilatation of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles with destruction of alveoli, reducing the alveolar surface area available for respiratory exchange.

It is usually transmitted by infected sputum, typically from close contacts such as family members, but is unlikely to be transmitted between normal social contacts. TB can present an occupational risk to health-care professionals, including dental staff. One outbreak of drug-resistant TB in New York involved at least 357 patients, most of whom contracted TB in one of 11 hospitals; nearly 90% of the patients were also HIV-positive, and most were young males of Hispanic or African heritage. TB has been transmitted between passengers during long-haul airline flights. The risk of transmitting TB though air circulation is now low because the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters on newer commercial aircraft are of the same type as those used in hospital respiratory isolation rooms; indeed, the number of times air is cleaned each hour exceeds the recommendation for hospital isolation rooms.",

It is now as common in London as in the developing world, and is seen especially in immigrants, such as those from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and South Asia. This increase appears to be a result of the development of TB disease in individuals who may have been infected for some time and of new infections acquired in the UK, or as a result of travel to other countries where TB is common. London accounted for the highest proportion of cases in the UK in 2011 (39%), followed by the West Midlands region (11%); 74% of these were born outside the UK and mainly originated from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Acid-fast bacilli are rarely seen in oral biopsies, even with the help of special stains, so unfixed material should also be sent for culture if possible.

Most TB lymphadenitis is painless, with several enlarged, matted nodes, but systemic symptoms are present only in a minority and only about 15% have pulmonary manifestations on radiography (Fig. 15.7\n). Diagnosis relies on tuberculin testing, which can be positive in both tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis. Any person with lymphadenopathy and recent conversion from a negative to positive tuberculin test should be suspected of having mycobacterial infection, and this should prompt biopsy (e.g. fine-needle aspiration biopsy) for culture or histological confirmation. PCR will improve diagnosis, as culture must wait 4\u20138 weeks for a result. Oral complications of antitubercular therapy are rare, but rifabutin and rifampicin can cause red saliva.",

Cricopharyngeal dysfunction involves cricopharyngeal muscle spasm or achalasia of the superior oesophageal sphincter, and can be seen in infants who have a normal sucking reflex but have incoordination during swallowing, possibly secondary to delayed development or cerebral palsy. Anatomical disorders, such as cleft palate, pharyngeal pouch, oesophageal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, duodenal obstruction or malrotation, and motility disorders, such as achalasia, may have an aspiration risk. Infirm older patients are also at risk of aspiration, especially if they are bed-bound or have neurological disorders. Isolated superior laryngeal nerve damage, vocal cord paralysis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and Riley\u2013Day syndrome (familial dysautonomia) are all associated with increased risk of aspiration.",

The degree to which subsequent growth corrects these deformations is currently unknown, though the palatal grooves typically regress by the age of 2 years.
