Follow-up of healthy volunteers vaccinated with an attenuated CHIKV strain has provided evidence of persistence of significant antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity after 12 months [33, 34] . In the present study, we provide evidence that, similar to what was observed in individuals vaccinated with an attenuated CHIKV strain, naturally infected individuals still have circulating neu-tralizing antibodies up to 12 months after acute CHIKV infection. In our study, the detection rate of anti-CHIKV antibodies by ELISA in 80% of donors results from the clinical criteria used for selecting the donors of the immunoreactivity study. Thus, in the context of a high prevalence of CHIKV infection (e.g., \u223c33% of the R\u00e9unionese population) and a selection of plasma donors in the early postepidemic period, purified anti-CHIKVIg (exhibiting in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activities) can be obtained by applying the classical procedure used to produce the purified polyvalent Ig T\u00e9g\u00e9line to plasma samples from donors selected only on the basis of clinical criteria.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of pre-and postexposure protection conferred by CHIKVIg in immunocompromised adult mice and immunocompetent mouse neonates. These mouse models of CHIKV infection exhibit the features characterizing severe human CHIKV infection [19] : in both models, a single dose of CHIKV immune human plasma or CHIKVIg inhibited viral dissemination and abrogated lethality associated with CHIKV when administered at least 8 h after infection, and the level of protection correlates with the amount of antibodies transferred. The fact that the dose of CHIKVIg that protected 100% of animals was higher for adult mice (830 mg/kg) than for mouse neonates (100 mg/kg) likely results from the higher susceptibility of the IFN-a/bR \u03ea/\u03ea mouse model. Indeed, the LD100 in WT mouse neonates is 10 6 PFU, and it is only 10 PFU in adult IFN-a/bR \u03ea/\u03ea mice; the mean survival time is shorter for adult IFN-a/bR \u03ea/\u03ea mice than for infected mouse neonates [19] . Nevertheless, total protection can be obtained regardless of the mouse IFN-a/bR \u03ea/\u03ea status and the age of animals. Moreover, CHIKVIg administration completely abolishes viral dissemination into serum and the brain and strongly alleviates liver and muscle infection. It is noteworthy that the 100-mg/kg dose of CHIKVIg did not completely inhibit viral replication in muscle of mouse neonates by day 6 after infection, although the 830-mg/kg dose abolished muscle infection in IFN-a/bR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Indeed, we have previously shown that after intradermal injection, CHIKV is detectable first in liver and then in blood before reaching its peripheral target tissues: the muscles, joints, and skin [19] . In the present study, we found that CHIKVIg strongly restricts liver infection and viremia and totally blocks CHIKV dissemination to the CNS. These data suggest that liver infection and viremia precedes virus spreading to the CNS and that control of liver infection and viremia by anti-CHIKV antibodies is sufficient to prevent CNS infection.
