We tested the effect of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) VPgPro on translation of reporter RNAs in in vitro translation systems. The presence of VPgPro in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems lead to inhibition of translation. The inhibition did not appear to be mediated by the interaction of VPg with the eIF(iso) 4E translation initiation factor since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E still inhibited translation. Monitoring the fate of RNAs revealed that they were degraded as a result of addition of TuMV VPgPro or of Norwalk virus (NV) VPg protein. The RNA degradation was not the result of translation being arrested and was heat labile and partially EDTA sensitive. The capacity of TuMV VPgPro and of (NV) VPg to degrade RNA suggests that these proteins have a ribonucleolytic activity which may contribute to the host RNA translation shutoff associated with many virus infections.",

The VPg was shown to interact with translation initiation factors eIF(iso) 4E (eukaryotic initiation factor (iso)4E) and PABP (poly(A)binding protein) (L\u00e9onard et al., 2004; Wittmann et al., 1997) . These interactions suggest a role for the VPg in the recruitment of translation initiation factors for viral RNA translation. Mutations in either VPg or eIF(iso)4E result in reduced ability of the virus to infect its host. Mutations in the eIF(iso)4Einteracting domain of VPg lead to loss of virus infectivity (L\u00e9onard et al., 2000) , and disruption of plant eIF(iso)4E gene prevented TuMV infection (Duprat et al., 2002; Lellis et al., 2002) . The involvement of VPg in facilitating viral RNA translation was shown for Feline calicivirus (FCV) (Goodfellow et al., 2005) where FCV translation is dependent on the presence of VPg at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome. The VPg-eIF4E interaction is required for virus RNA translation since sequestration of eIF4E by 4E-BP1 inhibited translation. It was suggested that FCV VPg acts as a 'cap substitute' during translation initiation of virus mRNA.",

            "text": "Viruses that infect eukaryotic cells use a variety of mechanisms for subverting the functions of the host cell. Several viruses alter the translation machinery such that they effectively block translation of host mRNAs. Viruses often target translation initiation factors as a mean to increase their own translation at the expense of that of their host. The main strategies are either to compromise eIF4G or PABP functions by proteolytic cleavage, to sequester eIF4E or to alter the phosphorylation state of host translation factors (reviewed by Gale et al., 2000) . Another key aspect of virus infection in plants and animals is the associated host transcription shutdown (Aranda and Maule, 1998; Jen et al., 1980) . For instance, infection of plant cells with a potyvirus (carrying a 5\u2032-bound VPg) leads to transient disappearance of most cellular mRNAs in cells supporting active viral replication (Aranda et al., 1996) . It is not clear whether the disappearance of RNAs is the consequence of mRNA destabilization resulting from a stress response, of host transcription inhibition, or of targeted degradation resulting from a viral ribonuclease activity.",

Purified TuMV VPgPro inhibited translation of capped reporter RNA, as was observed when VPg of NV was added to an in vitro translation system. The VPgPro-eIF(iso)4E interaction was likely not involved in the inhibition of translation since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E did inhibit translation. We observed that this inhibition of translation was concurrent with degradation of reporter RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Purified total plant RNA was also degraded when VPgPro was added; the same effect was observed with the VPg domain alone. A similar ribonucleolytic activity was also observed with NV VPg.

SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein extracts obtained from soluble fractions following GST affinity chromatography showed that protein bands corresponding to both the VPg and VPgPro proteins were present. This is consistent with the data of M\u00e9nard et al. (1995) that showed that recombinant TuMV VPgPro self-cleaves into two functional domains, the VPg and Pro domains. A prominent 55 kDa band [VPg domain (22 kDa) + N-terminal tag (33 kDa)] and a fainter 82 kDa band [VPgPro domain (49 kDa) + N-terminal tag (33 kDa)] ( Fig. 1) corresponding to GST-VPg and GST-VPgPro, respectively, were found in the preparation. Both the GST-VPg and GST-VPgPro fusions were obtained since the GST domain was fused at the Nterminus of the protein. The D77N mutant of VPgPro was similarly expressed and purified (Fig. 1) . The identity of the proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal anti-VPgPro serum (data not shown). The lower molecular weight products resulted from degradation of the fused GST moiety. NV and TuMV VPg proteins were also expressed in E. coli cells as Nterminal GST fusions (a fusion tag of 26 kDa); fusion proteins of 53 kDa ( Fig. 1) Triticum aestivum eIF(iso)4E protein was expressed as an Nterminal T7 fusion protein of 28 kDa (Fig. 1 ).",

We reasoned that if the eIF(iso)4E-VPgPro interaction is essential for the inhibition of translation, the addition of D77N into WGE or RRL translation systems would not interfere with translation of the m 7 G-luciferase RNA. Increasing amounts of GST-VPgPro, GST or GST-D77N were added to translation reactions (WGE and RRL). GST-VPgPro or GST-D77N both decreased translation of the reporter gene in the same fashion, in both the RRL and WGE systems. Addition of GST had no effect on translation of the reporter RNA (Fig. 2) .",

Protein retention was detected using a monoclonal anti-T7-tag antibody. Non-specific binding of the secondary antibody was verified by incubating VPgPro and eIF(iso)4E in absence of anti-T7 tag antibody (bar 2). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Groups a and b are statistically different (P < 0.001). After addition of luciferase RNA in the RRL in presence of GST or GST-VPgPro from TuMV, or in presence of NV VPg, RNA was collected at different times and purified. Fig. 4 shows that reporter RNA is degraded when TuMV GST-VPgPro or NV GST-VPg, but not GST, is added to the translation assay. An incubation period as short as 5 min was sufficient to allow TuMV GST-VPgPro to degrade the reporter RNA. Ribosomal RNA was not affected by the addition of either protein to the in vitro RRL. mRNA turnover can be substantially increased when translation is arrested (Stanssens et al., 1986) . We tested whether or not RNA degradation was triggered by the absence of translation. Reporter RNA was incubated without added protein or with 48 pmol of GST or GST-VPgPro from TuMV in WGE in presence of cycloheximide. The addition of 600 \u03bcM of cycloheximide to the in vitro translation system completely inhibited translation of the reporter luciferase RNA since no light emission was detected (data not shown). Samples were collected at different times and RNA was electrophoresed, blotted and hybridized with a 32 P-labelled RNA probe complementary to the luciferase RNA. Fig. 5 shows that the reporter luciferase RNA was degraded more rapidly in the presence of TuMV GST-VPgPro compared to controls where no protein was added or where GST was added.",

The VPg-eIF4E interaction is important for virus infection since mutations in either VPg or eIF4E of potyviruses lead to the reduction of symptoms or the absence of infection (Duprat et al., 2002; Lellis et al., 2002; L\u00e9onard et al., 2000) .

We show that recombinant VPgPro inhibits translation of capped reporter RNA, both in plant and animal in vitro translation systems. One hypothesis that would explain the effect of VPg on translation is that sequestration of eIF(iso)4E by VPgPro in the extract could interfere with translation. eIF4E has been reported to be the least abundant translation factor, and perhaps the rate limiting one, in animal cells (Duncan et al., 1987) . However, the inhibition of translation was not relieved by addition of supplementary eIF(iso)4E in the translation system. A VPgPro mutant that could no longer interact with eIF(iso)4E (L\u00e9onard et al., 2000) was also tested. The mutant could still inhibit translation. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the interaction between VPgPro-eIF(iso)4E is responsible for the inhibition of translation.",

The addition of TuMV GST-VPgPro led to the degradation of reporter RNA over time. RNA remained intact when GST protein purified in the same way as VPgPro was added to the translation system. The effect was linked to the presence of VPgPro as the rest of the fusion protein expressed without viral sequences did not lead to RNA degradation, therefore eliminating the possibility that a contaminating RNase from E. coli was co-purified along with the fusion tags. RNA degradation was not the result of translation inhibition as it was observed in translation reactions arrested by the addition of cycloheximide; RNA degradation was observed only in samples that contained VPgPro protein. Daughenbaugh et al. (2003) have also observed an inhibition of translation when NV VPg was added to an in vitro translation system. We speculated that both the NV VPg and TuMV VPgPro proteins inhibit translation through RNA destabilization and/or degradation. In our experiments, the addition of NV to the in vitro translation system lead to the degradation of reporter RNAs as was observed for TuMV. Given that the TuMV VPgPro and NV VPg proteins were purified according to different protocols and share little homology, it is unlikely that both proteins interact with the same contaminating RNAse from E. coli. Since the VPg protein was always predominant relative to the full length VPgPro protein in the protein preparations, we examined the capacity of the VPg domain alone to degrade RNA. As seen with NV, we also observed that the VPg domain of TuMV was sufficient for RNA degradation. The proteinase portion of VPgPro was not required for ribonuclease activity.",

For example, proteins of RNA viruses such as the Influenza virus, Leishmania RNA virus 1-4, of flaviviruses and of coronaviruses were shown to have ribonuclease activity (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Hulst and Moormann, 2001; Klumpp et al., 2001; Ro and Patterson, 2000) .

TuMV could enhance its access to the translation and replication components of the cell by degrading host mRNAs.

            "text": "It is interesting that rRNA was degraded when VPgPro was added to purified plant RNA (i.e. where proteins had been removed). However, rRNA remained intact but reporter RNA was degraded when VPg was added to RRL translation system. The unspecific RNase activity displayed by VPg raises the question of how TuMV protects its own RNA against degradation. It is possible that cellular factors present in infected plant cells (and absent from the in vitro translation systems) regulate VPg's ribonucleolytic activity. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the RNase activity associated with the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) vhs protein exhibits a higher specificity in vivo (Krikorian and Read, 1991; Kwong and Frenkel, 1987; Oroskar and Read, 1989; Zelus et al., 1996) than in an in vitro RRL (Lu et al., 2001) . Vhs-mediated host shutoff is characterized by disruption of pre-existing polyribosomes, and accelerated turnover of host mRNA. Vhs displays little sequence specificity in vitro and targets most, if not all, cellular and viral mRNAs, in vivo other cytoplasmic transcripts such as rRNA, tRNA and 7SL RNA are spared during infection. We speculate that rRNA was not degraded in our in vitro translation system because of the protection offered by the ribosome ribo-nucleoprotein complex. The number of host proteins involved in replication/ translation of virus RNA is growing and the involvement of a large ribonucleoprotein complex is an emerging theme across positive-strand RNA viruses (reviewed by Thivierge et al., 2005) . It is also possible that the ribonucleoprotein complex formed during replication and translation of the viral RNA may protect that RNA from degradation, as we observed with rRNA embedded in ribosomes. The association of viral RNA with different cellular factors, perhaps as a result of different subcellular localizations, may regulate the specificity of the nucleolytic activity. It is also possible that the conditions used in vitro altered the specificity of the activity. The localization of ribonuclease activity to the nucleus, and not the cytoplasm, would allow an extensive reprogramming of host gene expression while protecting viral RNA. The VPgPro protein of potyviruses is normally found in the nucleus of infected cells (Schaad et al., 1996) .",

VPg may interact with eIF4E isoforms to facilitate the recruitment of the host translation apparatus to its RNA, while removing host mRNAs to reduce competition. Further work is needed however to assess the role of VPg RNase activity during potyvirus infection in planta and how TuMV's RNA, if its the case, avoids degradation.",
