It is possible that some area in these Departments should better be isolated in the same way as the red area in Lodi Department, and indeed such measures are presently under consideration.

A numerical simulation with initial datum I(0) = 5 shows that this stage is reached for T 0 \u2243 15 days, showing the estimate is too pessimistic. The effect of restrictive measures and public awareness is to reduce the contacts among individuals, hence the rate a. Reducing a by a factor 2 suffices to move the peak at T 1 \u2243 35 days, and reducing it by a factor 4 suffices to move it to day 120; correspondingly, the number of ill people at peak time is substantially reduced, see in this respect Figure 8 .

One should not forget,indeed, that albeit COVID is lethal only in a relatively small number of cases,of the order of 1% (to be however compared with the 10 \u22124 of flu), this refers to the situation where patients can be properly assisted; as well known, a saturation of Hospital facilities, or even just of Intensive Care units, would lead to a dramatic increase of the mortality rate.",
