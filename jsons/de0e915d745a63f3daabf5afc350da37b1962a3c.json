Meanwhile, we also studied the clinical characteristics of the cases, combined with CT manifestations, to provide more clues for the correct diagnosis of the disease.",

P9 and P14 had diabetes and other patients had no underlying diseases. Among the 14 cases, 10 of them had a history of exposure to Wuhan or Hubei, while, P6 and P7 had no clear epidemiological history. P3/P4, P10/P11 were family clustering disease. All the patients performed oropharyngeal swabs test and confirmed as COVID-19. Common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative. For patients' venous blood tests at disease onset, as given in ( Table 1 ) , we found that leucocytes and lymphocytes were slightly decreased or normal, eosinophil count were slightly decreased in 12 cases and normal in 2 cases. Neutrophil counts were normal for all the patients, and CRP was increased in 6 cases. PCT was normal or slightly elevated.",

Our research has some new findings on the basis of previous study: (1) The decrease of eosinophil count may be helpful for the early diagnosis of the disease. Nevertheless, till now, there is no study refer to blood tests 2 , 3 mentioned eosinophil, which is worthy of further study. (2) Our CT study found that COVID-19 has a variety of manifestations. In the early stage of the disease, the lesion can manifest as round nodular-like GGO in the central area of the lung lobe, which is different from the common imaging manifestations that are patchy-like lesion in subpleural region. 4-6 (3) The follow-up CT images showed the lesions are migratory manifested as the absorption of the primary lesions and the emergence of new lesions, which had not been reported yet. (4) The false negative rate of oropharyngeal swabs seems high. As we know that, oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, 7 The initial CT images of P2-P7. CT images of P2 ( Fig. 2 , P2 , A1-A2), P5 ( Fig. 2 , P5) , P6 ( Fig. 2 , P6 , A1-A2) and P7 ( Fig. 2 , P7 , A1-A4) showed subpleural lesions, a nodular-like lesion with pseudocavitary sign ( Fig. 2 , P7 , A3, arrow) and mild bronchiectasis ( Fig. 2 , P6 , A2, arrow) were also observed within the lesion. CT images of P3 ( Fig.  2 , P3, A1-A2) and P4 ( Fig. 2 , P4) showed round nodular-like GGO lesions (P3 and P4, arrow) located in the central area of the lung. Fig. 3 .

CT images of P10 ( Fig. 3 , P10, A1-A2) showed bilateral multiple lesions, some of them were pure GGO located in the central region of the lung.
