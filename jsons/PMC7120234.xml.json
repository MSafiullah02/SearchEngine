            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first novel infectious respiratory disease in this century. The first known case of SARS was retrospectively identified in Foshan City, Gungdong, China, in late 2002 (1). After its introduction to Hong Kong in mid-February 2003, the virus spread across many countries within weeks. On 15 March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a travel advisory and officially recognized this atypical pneumonia as \u201cSARS.\u201d Three research groups independently reported a novel group 2 coronavirus (CoV) as the etiology for the disease in late March (2\u20134). Subsequently enormous efforts were taken to contain the disease. On 5 July 2003, the WHO declared that the epidemic had been contained worldwide. In this outbreak, over 8000 SARS patients were reported and 10% of them died from the disease. Several lines of evidence indicated that the disease was a result of spillovers of the virus from animals to humans (5). In particular, SARS-like viral isolates that are almost identical to human isolates were recovered from infected Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) (6). Further studies also indicated that the virus is a distant relative of bat CoVs (7\u201310), suggesting that bats might be natural carriers of the precursor of SARS-CoV. However, the natural reservoir of the virus has yet to be defined.",

            "text": "As detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens enabled prompt identification of patients who were at the early stage of disease onset, the focus of early diagnosis was primarily on the development of conventional and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ((RT-PCR) assays during the outbreak (5). Sporadic human cases were reported after the SARS epidemic, most of these patients having acquired the infection from laboratories or from infected palm civets (5), which is an indication that SARS might reemerge in the future. This prompted many groups to develop more rapid, sensitive, and highly specific laboratory tests for SARS preparedness. Non-PCR-based nucleic acid amplification assays, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (11,12), rolling circle amplification (RAC) (13), and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (14) were also developed for the detection of SARS-CoV. However, owing to the limited availability of clinical specimens, most of these novel molecular assays could not be evaluated to any great extent.",

By contrast, fecal samples have the highest positive rate after the first week of onset. However, to increase the chance of identifying SARS patients in a nonepidemic period, we recommend testing multiple specimens available from suspected patients.For respiratory samples isolated from early disease onset, the detect rates could be enhanced by increasing the initial extraction volume of the NPA sample from 140 to 560 \u03bcl (18).Personal protection equipment should be worn by the health care worker taking specimens from suspect or probable SARS patients (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/infectioncontrol/en/)For extracting RNA from suspected infectious samples, the procedure must be handled in a Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 containment with BSL 3 work practices (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/).Buffer AVL containing carrier RNA might form white precipitates when it is stored at 4\u00b0C. The precipitates can be dissolved in the buffer by heating the bottle in a water bath. Cool the buffer to room temperature before use.General procedures to prevent PCR cross contamination should be strictly followed. Aerosol-resistant filtered pipette tips can minimize possible carryovers of amplicons. Separate pipettes and areas are used for sample processing, PCR, and post-PCR analysis. It is essential to include multiple positive and negative controls in the PCR reactions when a large number of samples are tested at the same time.Agarose solutions can be superheated in a microwave oven. Do not handle the bottle immediately after microwaving. Always wear heat-resistant gloves when handling melted agarose.Ethidium bromide is a known mutagen and may be carcinogenic. Handle solutions of ethidium bromide with gloves.UV light can cause severe skin and eye damage. Wear safety glasses and close the photography hood before turning on the UV transilluminator.The conventional RT-PCR protocol is highly specific to SARS-CoV isolated from respiratory samples. However, we observed a few false-positive results from RNA isolated from stool (15). To overcome this problem, all of our positive fecal samples were retested by the quantitative RT-PCR as described in Section 3.5 or a SYBR green-based RT-PCR assay (1\n9) for confirmation.When performing step 6 in Section 3.5, the RNA samples, including those positive standards, must be handled with extreme care. Cross-contamination might lead to false-positive or unreliable quantitative results.The amplification curves of all positive samples in the quantitative RT-PCR assays must be examined individually. We occasionally find some clinical specimens yielding high backgrounds and the analytical program might misclassify these samples as positive.To exclude the negative results owing to the poor recovery of RNA, the poor performance of RT-PCR reaction, the presence of PCR inhibitors, or human error, we subsequently modified our quantitative RT-PCR assays to a duplex assay. The revised test allows simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and endogenous 18S rRNA derived from host cells (20). The primers and probe for 18S rRNA are commercially available (TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents, Applied Biosystems).\n",
