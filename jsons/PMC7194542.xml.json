At the time of the survey, there were sporadic cases of unknown transmission routes in multiple regions in Japan, and small clusters of patients in some regions of the country, mainly in urban areas. (JMHLW, 2020b). As of February 25, the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Japan totaled 157 (WHO, 2020c). Outside Japan, a sudden increase in cases was reported in Italy, Iran, and South Korea (Figure 1\n) (WHO, 2020c). The study participants were recruited from the registrants of a Japanese Internet research service company called MyVoice Communication, Inc., which had approximately 1.12 million registered participants as of January 2020. In this study, we aimed to collect data from 2400 men and women aged 20 to 79 years (sampling by sex and 10-year age groups; 12 groups, n\n = 200 in each group) who were living in seven prefectures near the Tokyo metropolitan area (i.e., Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma). The Tokyo metropolitan area is home to approximately 35% of the total Japanese population (total area: 32,433.4 km2; total population: 43,512,238 people as of January 2019). The company invited registrants to participate in the survey by email on February 25 (n\n = 8156). The questionnaires were placed in a protected area of a website, and the potential respondents received a specific URL in their invitation email. When 200 participants in each group responded to the questionnaire voluntarily, we stopped accepting responses from that group, and concluded the survey on February 27 when 200 responses were collected from all groups. Reward points valued at 50 yen were provided as an incentive for participation (approximately 0.5 US dollars as of February 2020).",

The demand for face masks was up to 100 times higher than normal and prices were up to 20 times higher (WHO, 2020g). In contrast, the WHO states that wearing medical masks may create a false sense of security, leading to the neglect of other essential preventive measures (WHO, 2020e). Personal protective measures should ideally be combined with other approaches, as individual measures may not be so effective when implemented alone (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020, Lee et al., 2009). It may be unclear to what extent the preventive effects differ depending on the frequency and type of preventive action and the number of actions taken but increasing the frequency and type of action may be effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19.",

For example, the prevalence of hand hygiene implementation among the participants in this study was 83.8% under the loose standards and 58.5% under the strict standards. However, the median daily hand hygiene events implemented by participants who claimed to practice hand hygiene under loose standards were 6 times/day. The WHO has not recommended a specific number of times a day that hand hygiene should be practiced, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends implementation after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing (US CDC, 2020). In general, the average person eats meals and uses the toilet multiple times per day, so hand hygiene performed 6 times/day is unlikely to be sufficient. When advocating for public awareness of personal protective measures, it may also be important to communicate specific ways of implementing preventive actions. The Japanese government provides detailed explanations on personal protective measures on its website (JMHLW, 2020a), but the percentage of respondents of people obtaining information from a reliable source was only 38.1%. It is therefore essential that the government conduct further educational campaigns targeting ordinary citizens, especially men and persons under 65 years old.",

Relatively little is known about the characteristics of people in online communities (Wright, 2017). Furthermore, the age and sex demographics of the participants in this study were different from that of the Japanese population (Statistics Bureau of Japan, 2019). Additionally, this survey was conducted during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, the prevalence of personal protective measures may change with time. Finally, the results may only be directly applied to Japanese populations. In the case of other populations with different cultural, ethnic, and geographical backgrounds, the prevalence of the personal protective measures may be very different compared with those reported in the present survey. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to clarify the implementation status of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.",
