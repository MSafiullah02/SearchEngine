Over the last 12 years, studies have suggested several important physiological benefits associated with NAVA, including improved breath synchronization and effective assist that is proportional to neural respiratory drive [2, 3]. Studies have not yet, however, demonstrated improved patient outcomes as was originally suggested [1], with only two, relatively small trials finding non-statistically significant effects on secondary outcomes [3, 4].",

Estimates of intervention adherence and protocol compliance provide critical information for the calculation of statistical power [6]. Randomized controlled clinical trials are expensive [7], and poor adherence risks a type II error, with an intervention deemed ineffective when it was actually not delivered with sufficient fidelity [8, 9]. Although good NAVA mode adherence was observed up to 48 h from randomization in a recent efficacy RCT [3], conflicting results were reported in a subsequent physiological RCT where NAVA failed in 7/20 (35%) participants across the same time period. To date, no trial has investigated adherence to a NAVA trial protocol beyond 48 h or determined the reasons for adherence or lack thereof.",

In contrast to previous trials, recruitment was commenced soon after intubation (ability to trigger the ventilator was not a requirement for inclusion), and the intervention was continued to the end of MV support or D28. In addition, reasons for mode cross-over and poor adherence were recorded. Some study results have been previously reported in the form of abstracts [10, 11].",

A lower target level of 8 \u03bcV was set following basic analysis of existing literature and local audit data to avoid over-ventilation and over-sedation. NAVA parameters were set by clinicians according to a pragmatic protocol (Additional file 1), which involved matching hypothetical to actual pressure delivery (NAVA preview mode) and a brief period of observation to ensure stability.

Secondary feasibility outcomes were the proportion of participants with mode cross-over, duration of cross-over, reasons for cross-over, protocol acceptability (participant consent/physician refusal rates), and recruitment rates. Secondary exploratory outcomes included ventilator-free days (VFDs) to D28 and D90 and duration of MV from randomization; ICU, hospital, D28, and D90 mortality; ICU and hospital length-of-stay from randomization; mean RASS; and sedation dose and bolus dose frequency per infusion day. Safety outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pneumothoraxes, and incidence of unplanned extubation (Additional file 1).",

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Categorical data were compared using chi-square or Fisher exact tests and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney or independent samples t tests as appropriate. Effect sizes are reported as median difference (MD) using the Hodges-Lehmann estimating method [15] for continuous variables, and as relative risk (RR) for binary data [18]. Effect estimates are reported with 95% CIs [18, 19]. Time to breathing without assistance and live ICU discharge are displayed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests. A two-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis of clinical outcomes was exploratory and uncorrected for multiple comparisons; therefore, the statistically significant results could be due to chance. Qualitative descriptions of cross-over were categorized using content analysis [20]. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.04 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).",
