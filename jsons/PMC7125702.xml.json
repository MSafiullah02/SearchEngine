That this pandemic was mild does not preclude a more serious pandemic in the future. In fact, many aspects of the recent swine flu pandemic meant that it was, in some senses, ideal in that it began in the Americas rather than the developing world, leading to early detection, low pathogenesis, a reasonably high level of immunity in the adult population and sustained susceptibility to antivirals. Had these criteria not been fulfilled, as might be the case in a future pandemic, the consequences could have been much more serious.",

The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) especially gave impetus to pandemic preparedness planning and conjecture regarding the anticipated pandemic and its impact (Keogh-Brown & Smith, 2008). However, preparedness planning generally concentrates upon the impact on population health and on policies to maintain a functioning health sector during a pandemic, although the wider economic impact of infectious disease pandemics, and policies to address them, has been the subject of increasing investigation (Keogh-Brown and Smith, 2008, Keogh-Brown et al., 2010a, McKibbin and Sidorenko, 2006).",

For example, the US is said to have the largest and most sophisticated financial services sector in the world (Nolan, Shippey, Woznick, & Hinkelman, 1995), financial services contributed approximately 8% of Australian GDP in 20031\n, and 26.8% of GDP for Hong Kong in 2009,2\nThe UK economy, which is used in this application to illustrate the potential impacts to \u2018similar\u2019 economies has a financial sector contributing 8% to total GDP3\nWith respect to pandemic preparedness, this raises a specific policy question concerning the extent to which this sector may be affected by a pandemic, and the likely policies to mitigate the pandemic\u2019s effects. The limited work thus far on the wider macroeconomic impact of pandemic influenza, alluded to above, has considered different aspects of an influenza pandemic but, in each case, the financial sector has been aggregated together with other service industries and sectors. As a result, little can be said about the sectoral impact of a pandemic over the results for the aggregated economic effect. The work presented here therefore focuses on assessing the macroeconomic impact of an influenza pandemic on a single country economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, which allows for a disaggregated finance sector, as outlined in the sector listing in the Appendix, to generate greater specificity in analysis. Application of this model to multiple countries is possible, as the model specification would not differ if applied to different countries with large financial sectors. Although the underlying database would differ between countries, as would some model parameters such as elasticities, the results should be seen as reasonably comparable across \u201csimilar\u201d countries. We therefore present the results from a model of the UK, but suggest that these results are indicative for other nations also.",

The differences between origins are encapsulated as follows. Domestically produced commodities are sold both in the domestic market and abroad. Sales abroad take the form of exports and are modelled using a Constant Elasticity of Transformation function. Domestic sales originate from domestic and foreign sources (imports) and this is modelled using a composite commodity and Armington assumption which determines the combination of domestically produced commodities and imports by means of a constant elasticity of substitution. Composite commodities can then be used as an input into the production process of the domestically produced commodities or sold for final consumption by households, government or investment. This is a common CGE model methodology and is used and outlined elsewhere (L\u00f6fgren et al., 2001, Smith et al., 2005).",

In the autumn of 1957 a single wave pandemic occurred of about 15 weeks duration (Ministry Of Health, 1960). In 1968/69 a two-wave pandemic affected the UK resulting in a small first wave in March 1969, and a main wave in midwinter of 1969/70 (Cooper, Pitman, Edmunds, & Gay, 2006). Based on information from these previous pandemics, time series simulations were conducted to represent influenza mortality by age and over time for three different severities of pandemic (Kramer, 2007); these severities are referred to as mild (CFR = 0.06%), moderate (CFR = 0.18%) and severe (CFR = 0.35%). Note that the scenarios include allowance for a limited stock of antivirals to be made available to key workers, as this is part of the UK preparedness response; the impact of wider use of antivirals for the general public is considered in the sensitivity analysis.",

Table 1 outlines the impact of a three -week school closure policy as outlined in (Ferguson et al., 2006). We assume that this school closure will mitigate the pandemic in the proportion described in (Ferguson et al., 2006) where a 34% CAR was estimated to reduce by 2% due to school closure. Analysis of the Labour Force Survey (2005) suggests that there are a total of 25,245,000 individuals aged 16\u201364 who are in paid employment in the UK. Of these 3,900,000 are women who are either the head of the household or the spouse of, or cohabiting with, the head of the household and have dependent children in the household aged under 16 years. That is, 15.5% of the workforce comprises women who are probably responsible for dependent children (Sadique et al., 2007). However, other research suggests that 54% of parents have access to informal care arrangements for their children (Sadique, Adams, and Edmunds, 2008) and we use this estimate to mitigate the absences resulting from school closure.",

The results of this survey state that 34% of workers would take prophylactic absenteeism in the event of an influenza pandemic, of which 3.75% were women who had children at school and would therefore overlap with the school closure absenteeism. However, the remaining 30.25% represent the additional shock due to prophylactic absenteeism. It should be highlighted that there is some uncertainty as to whether individuals who state a willingness to take prophylactic absenteeism would, in reality, carry out this intention, so this shock should be seen as a \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate which may be higher or lower in reality. Evidence to suggest a mitigation effect of school closure has already been outlined, but such mitigation is not assumed in response to prophylactic absence. (Ferguson, et al., 2006) suggests that transmission rates in the workplace are similar to those in the home. A very small (1%) mitigation effect for workplace closure is mentioned but this occurs when entire workplaces are closed, not for partial closure as might result from prophylactic absence. These scenarios are tabulated in Table 1.",

Interestingly, together with the retail, hotels and restaurant sector (RHR) and transport and telecommunications sector (T_T), these sectors also experience the greatest differential in impact between the situation concerning disease only, versus those with school closure, prophylactic absenteeism or all combined. This may reflect the more essential physical presence of workers in the manufacturing process, or the service sector, than elsewhere and less scope for capital substitution or virtual working (e.g. within financial sector). In terms of consumption (Fig. 3, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) it is clear that absenteeism (due to school closure and/or prophylactically) generates a more severe impact than the disease itself.",

This impact is reasonable since the industry is heavily reliant on labour supply and many of the industries that make up this sector, such as real estate activities, are unlikely to be in great demand during an influenza pandemic.

With respect to the financial sector, whilst the impacts are certainly no more significant than on other sectors, it is at least equivalent, if not worse, in all respects compared with retail, hotels and restaurants, and transport and telecommunications, which elsewhere have been identified as those sectors likely to be worst hit by an infectious disease pandemic (Keogh-Brown and Smith, 2008, Lee and McKibben, 2004). Further, the rapidity of the impact that will strike the financial sector may influence the overall effect and is an area that requires further consideration in future developments of the model which, at present, takes an annual average rather than accounting for the transitional effects of the time period and duration of the outbreak. For instance, the shock in a small location such as financial heart of a country may last only 6\u20138 weeks, compared with 15 weeks for the country overall (DoH, 2007).

Parameter estimates of the school closure and prophylactic absence were also required but, in reality, the precautionary behaviour that will be used is quite unpredictable. Nonetheless, the sensitivity analysis goes some way towards illustrating the changes in effect that are yielded by these variations in behaviour and results were quite sensitive to the large variations in prophylactic absence modelled in our sensitivity analysis.

The importance of the financial sector to the large economies of the world is such that further analysis would appear to be beneficial, especially if it were to account for the epidemiological effects of mitigation policies and the possibility of financial organisations shifting business to foreign branches during the pandemic peak and undertaking additional work when the pandemic strikes elsewhere. Further development of the modelling approach undertaken here together with exploration of the likely wider effects and how to parameterize these is therefore recommended. In the light of the current financial crisis, centered on the banking sector, we have in fact seen some of the ways in which any adverse impacts on that sector affect the entire UK economy. In that context it is advisable to consider the extreme vulnerability of an already compromised financial sector to the impact of a deadly respiratory disease prior to the recovery \u2013 if any \u2013 of that sector and the UK economy; a recovery which might take a decade or more.",
