Routine surveillance for influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) can provide estimates of the relative severity of influenza seasons, and can also provide clinical specimens from which influenza viruses can be detected. This allows comparison of circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains in the current influenza season, and may provide potential vaccine strains for future seasons.",
