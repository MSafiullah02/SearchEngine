In some patients this might lead to pneumonia, ARDS and ventilator 5 dependency. 6 In addition, milder symptoms, not commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infection 7 (URTI) can be the only presenting symptoms. These symptoms include loss of smell and taste, 8 stomach aches, body aches and nausea. 9 We present a case of COVID 19 infection with atypical debut in a patient having undergone 10 staged, endovascular thoraco-abdominal repair 2 weeks previously. The patient allowed 11 publication of this case and images. hypertension and left renal artery stenosis, which then was treated with a renal stent, creatinine at 1 admission was normal. 2 At initial referral, a computer tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed a 6,3 x 7,3 cm type III 3 Crawford thoraco-abdominal aneurysm (TAAA), extending from the mid descending thoracic 4 aorta to the aortic-iliac bifurcation (fig 1a +b) . The descending aorta was ectatic and \"shaggy\" 5 with large amounts of irregular intraluminal thrombus (Fig. 2) .

The more anatomically extensive the repair is, the higher the risk. Patients that 14 have shaggy aorta (aortic intra luminal wall thrombus) seem to be at even higher risk due to 15 athero-embolic embolization peri-procedurally (2). In addition, complications leading to drop in 16 blood pressure in the perioperative period are also considered aggravating factors. These can 17 consist of perioperative bleeding complications often connected to poor iliac access (narrow iliac 18 diameter preventing stent graft delivery). Due to these risks, if possible, a staged approach is 19 recommended for elective TAAA repair (3-4). This allows both for collateral network 20 mobilization to the SC and avoids some risks of perioperative bleeding complications occurring 21 in the same setting as a complete elective TAAA repair (5-6).",

An MR scan 13 of the medulla was performed to exclude ischemia and findings were normal. 14 The patient was isolated on admission due to his diarrhea.
