Of multiple infections, dual infection (90%) was predominant, in accordance with other authors (Martin et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2009). HRSV, HADV, and HCOV were mainly involved in mixed infections, as would be expected from their overlapping seasonal distribution. Although HRSV and HADV are among the viruses most commonly involved in mixed infections (Cantais et al., 2014, Harada et al., 2013), the relevance of rhinoviruses, HPIV, and IV has also been assessed (Lu et al., 2013). Very complex combinations of mixed viral infections have been observed (Lu et al., 2013, Martin et al., 2012, Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008) and certain pathogens appear to have higher multiple infection frequency (Brunstein et al., 2008). In this scenario, superinfection exclusion mechanisms preventing a secondary infection with the same or a closely related virus should be envisaged (Folimonova, 2012).",

However, there is evidence that genome quantification could clarify the role of each virus in mixed infections (Franz et al., 2010, Martin et al., 2012). Accordingly, high viral loads have been related to severe diseases (Franz et al., 2010, Hasegawa et al., 2014, Jansen et al., 2011), but conflicting results have been reported (Adams et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2012). In addition, some viruses have been detected in healthy children (Advani et al., 2012, Moe et al., 2016). In this study, molecular assays showed greater sensitivity when compared to culture assays (97.51% vs. 30.25%, P < 0.0001) and HRSV antigen detection (100% vs. 50%, P < 0.0001). Conversely, culture assays allowed the detection of infectious viruses in 426 (30.25%) of the 1408 positive samples, eventually providing a clue to discriminate the main causative agent in co-infections. Nevertheless, cautious conclusions should be drawn, since the growth difficulties of some viruses may have decreased the number of those found by culture assays, while the long-term viral excretion after clinical recovery in children with frequent ARTIs may have increased the mixed infection rate.",
