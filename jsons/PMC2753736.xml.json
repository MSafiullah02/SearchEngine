The worldwide outbreak of the disease in 2003 led to hundreds of deaths among thousands of total infected individuals (Skowronski et al., 2005). Although no new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, the study of SARS and its causative agent, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is continuing. SARS is still a safety concern because of the presence of possible animal reservoirs, including its natural reservoir bats and intermediate hosts such as palm civets and raccoon dogs (Guan et al., 2003, Kan et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005). Therefore, it is essential to develop vaccines against SARS for the prevention of future outbreaks.",

Among all of the SARS-CoV proteins, the S protein plays an essential role in receptor-binding, virus entry and membrane fusion (Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004). SARS-CoV first binds to the host cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Dimitrov, 2003, Kuhn et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Prabakaran et al., 2004), via its receptor-binding domain (RBD), a 193-amino acid (aa) fragment spanning the residues 318\u2013510 of the S1 region (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). The S protein is also the main domain in inducing neutralizing antibodies against SARS and is thus considered the main component for developing SARS vaccines (Du et al., 2009a).",

These S protein-based vaccine candidates may induce humoral immune responses and/or neutralizing antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses, in vaccinated animals (Hu et al., 2007a, Huang et al., 2006, Kobinger et al., 2007). A DNA vaccine encoding the S protein induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in healthy adults in a phase I clinical trial (Martin et al., 2008). Since the full-length S protein-based vaccines might induce potential harmful immune responses (Czub et al., 2005, Weingartl et al., 2004), vaccines based on the fragments of S protein, such as RBD, have a greater potential for developing into effective vaccines against SARS (Lee et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2006).",

However, the big molecule Fc in the fusion protein may cause some unwanted responses when it is used in humans as a SARS vaccine in the future. In addition, it is unknown whether insect cell and E. coli expression systems, which are suitable for production of recombinant proteins in large quantity, can be used for expression of rRBD with functionality, although it was reported that a truncated antigenic fragment (aa 441\u2013700) of S protein of SARS-CoV expressed in insect Sf9 cells exhibited high specificity and sensitivity in detection of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in sera of SARS patients and lacked cross-reactivity with sera of patients with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection (Manopo et al., 2005). In this study, we expressed the rRBD protein without Fc in three different expression systems, including mammalian 293T cells, insect Sf9 cells and E. coli, and compared their immunogenicity and protection in a mouse model.",

As shown in Fig. 1, rRBD without Fc expressed in mammalian cell 293T (RBD-293T), insect cell Sf9 (RBD-Sf9) and E. coli (RBD-Ec) were able to react with majority of a panel of mAbs that recognize different conformational and linear epitopes in RBD of SARS-CoV S protein, except the mAb 11E12. This Conf III mAb was generated by immunization with recombinant RBD-Fc fusion protein and characterized to recognize a specific conformational epitope presented on RBD when fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG (He et al., 2005), suggesting that this epitope may not be presented when rRBDs were independently expressed. The currently expressed three rRBD proteins without Fc could be obtained at > 90% purity (data not shown). In addition, all three rRBD proteins elicited strong RBD-specific antibody responses in the vaccinated mice, albeit the titers of antibodies induced by RBD-293T and RBD-Sf9 were significantly higher than that by RBD-Ec (Fig. 2). These results suggest that while all the three RBD proteins retain proper immunogenicity, the RBD expressed in E. coli is less immunogenic than those expressed in mammalian and insect cells. Similarly, all three rRBD proteins elicited high titers of neutralizing antibody that neutralized both SARS pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV infection in cell cultures in vitro although the titer of neutralizing antibodies induced by RBD-293T was higher than those by RBD-Sf9 and RBD-Ec (Fig. 3).",

Although the Fc fragment in fusion proteins containing HIV-1 antigen indeed significantly enhances the immunogenicity of the HIV-1 antigen and increases the production of neutralizing antibodies through different mechanisms, e.g., assisting the antigen binding to the FcR (Chen et al., 2007) or prolonging the in vivo half-life of the antigen (Zhang et al., 2009), Fc seems to be playing no critical role in enhancing the immunogenicity of rRBD of SARS-CoV. In the absence of Fc, the rRBD expressed in 293T cells elicited a similar level of neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in the vaccinated animals as the RBD-Fc expressed in 293T cells (He et al., 2004, He et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The second question that needs to be answered is whether the insect cell and E. coli expression systems are suitable for producing functional rRBD as vaccines. For large quantity production of a recombinant protein-based vaccine, the insect cell and E. coli expression systems are superior to the mammalian cell expression system. Both insect Sf9 cells and E. coli can grow at high density at room temperature without the supply of CO2, and express recombinant proteins in a fast, easy and reliable way, resulting in lower production cost and higher protein productivity than the mammalian expression system (Boosani and Sudhakar, 2006, Farinha-Arcieri et al., 2008, Marblestone et al., 2006, Saitoh et al., 2009). Although the rRBD expressed in mammalian 293T cells induces stronger RBD-specific antibody responses and higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than those expressed in insect cell and E. coli expression systems, RBD-Sf9 and RBD-Ec also maintained intact conformation and elicited neutralizing antibody responses strong enough to protect vaccinated hosts against SARS-CoV challenge (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table 1). Our previous study also demonstrated that rRBD-immunized aged mice with serum neutralizing antibody titers ranging from 1:189 to 1:505 had no detectable SARS-CoV in their lungs after virus challenge, but a marginal level of SARS-CoV replication was detected in one of the mice with serum neutralizing antibody titer of 1:57 (Du et al., 2007b). Other groups reported that mice immunized with attenuated virus or DNA vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV S protein, or with inactivated virus had serum neutralizing antibody titers ranging from 1:50 to 1:640 and most of these mice were protected from SARS-CoV challenge (Bisht et al., 2004, Stadler et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2004). Three patients who failed to respond to the available treatment recovered from serious SARS after transfusion of SARS convalescent plasma with neutralizing titer > 1:640 (Yeh et al., 2005). Based on these data, we suggest that any vaccine that induces in immunized mice the serum neutralizing antibody titers of > 1:500 would be considered as highly effective. According to these criteria, we believe that either insect cell or E. coli expression system can be used for production of RBD-based SARS subunit vaccines on a large scale because RBD-Sf9 and RBD-Ec could induce high titer (mean value > 1:700) of neutralizing antibodies and strong protective immunity that protect all the vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge.",

Considering that the rRBD protein expressed in mammalian 293T cells (RBD-293T) induced significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in insect Sf9 cells and E. coli, we will select mammalian cell-expressing rRBD protein for further evaluation of its in vivo efficacy in a non-human primate model of SARS before going to clinical trials.",

Briefly, 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV S protein and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science). Supernatant was harvested 72 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection of ACE2/293T cells. The pseudovirus-containing supernatant was preincubated with serially diluted mouse sera at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before adding to the cells. Fresh medium was added 24 h later, followed by lysing cells using cell lysis buffer (Promega). After addition of luciferase substrate (Promega), relative luciferase activity was determined in Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan). SARS pseudovirus neutralization was calculated and expressed as 50% neutralizing antibody titer, NT50 (Chou, 2006).",
