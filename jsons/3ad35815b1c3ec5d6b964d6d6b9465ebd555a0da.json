The antiviral function of IFN is mainly exerted by activating the JAK/STAT signalling and subsequently inducing IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) production. However, the mechanism by which IAV combat the type I IFN signalling pathway is not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the roles of human micro-RNAs modulated by IAV infection in type I IFN responses. We demonstrated that microRNA-30 (miR-30) family members were downregulated by IAV infection. Our data showed that the forced expression of miR-30 family members inhibited IAV proliferation, while miR-30 family member inhibitors promoted IAV proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that miR-30 family members targeted and reduced SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, and thus relieved their inhibiting effects on IFN/JAK/STAT signalling pathway. In addition, miR-30 family members inhibited the expression of NEDD4, a negative regulator of IFITM3, which is important for host defence against influenza viruses. Our findings suggest that IAV utilises a novel strategy to restrain host type I IFN-mediated antiviral immune responses by decreasing the expression of miR-30 family members, and add a new way to understand the mechanism of immune escape caused by influenza viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "influenza virus, microRNA-30, NEDD4, SOCS1, SOCS3", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "antagonistic factor of host IFN-\u03b2 production via inhibition of the RIG-I-MAVS signalling pathway (Krug, 2015; Pachler & Vlasak, 2011; Rajsbaum et al., 2012) , and the PB1-F2 protein was identified to block IFN-\u03b2 induction by targeting MAVS (Varga, Grant, Manicassamy, & Palese, 2012; Varga et al., 2011) .

MiR-30a, b, or c mimics transfection also significantly inhibited influenza virus proliferation in primary human alveolar epithelia cells (HAECs) (Figure S3). To further show the effect of miR-30 on influenza virus infection, we assessed viral infection in the presence of the miR-30a/b/c inhibitors at different times.

However, whether miRNAs participate in influenza virus-mediated inhibition of type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses is not very clear. In this study, we described a new strategy used by influenza virus to antagonise the type I IFN signalling pathway by decreasing host conserved miRNA expression (miR-30 family members). MiR-30 was shown to be a positive regulator of the antiviral response through inhibiting SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4 expression in this study. However, it is hard to verify whether miR-30 is more or less important in viral pathogenesis than other reported mechanisms. Nevertheless, influenza virus may promote its own survival by decreasing miR-30 via cooperation with its coding proteins to interfere with the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. The antiviral immune response is regulated in an accurate and sophisticated manner by multiple regulators, both negative and positive. The mechanisms of influenza virus-mediated immune evasion, through viral proteins or host molecules, are also complicated. Other miRNAs are likely involved in modulating influenza virus infection and virus-mediated immune evasion. Because one miRNA may act as a counterbalance to another, the overall function of these miRNAs in influenza virus infection may not be apparent. In addition to the miRNAs that showed substantial changes following influenza virus infection, miRNAs that showed little alteration may also function in viral infection via the cumulative impact of all or most of them, even if a single miRNA has little effect. Although we showed that miR-30 is used by influenza virus to counter the host antiviral immune response, we believe that further studies on miRNAs that participate in influenza virus infection are needed. In summary, we demonstrated that influenza virus infection significantly downregulated the expression of miR-30 family members, which modulated SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4 to impair the host antiviral response and promote influenza virus replication. We present a new strategy used by influenza virus to counter the type I IFNmediated antiviral immune response by engaging miRNAs, which may help to elucidate the mechanism of immune escape by influenza virus.
