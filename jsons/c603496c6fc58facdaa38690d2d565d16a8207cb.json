            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is classified into three subtypes and is the main cause of enteritis and myocarditis in young domestic and wild animals. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of CPV-2 in the feces of asymptomatic free-living coatis from Garden Forest Reserve, Palmital city, SP, Brazil. Fecal samples from 21 coatis (both sexes, different ages, and different aspects of feces) were collected in August 2014 and March 2015. The nucleic acid extracted was submitted to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to amplify a fragment of the VP2 gene of CPV-2. Eight (38%) fecal samples were positive in the PCR assay and were confirmed by sequencing. The 7 nucleotide (nt) sequences analyzed showed 100% nt identity with the prototype strain of CPV-2b (CPV-39 strain). The analysis of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed the presence of the GAT codon (aa D-Asp) at position 426 of the VP2 viral protein (subtype 2b). This study describes for the first time the identification of CPV-2b in asymptomatic free-living coatis (Nasua nasua) and suggests that coatis are susceptible to Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 infection and are important as a reservoir and an asymptomatic carrier to other wild and domestic animal species.",

The fragmentation of ecosystems due to anthropic impacts increases the contact between wild and domestic animals and, consequently, the cross-species transmission of viral pathogens [2] . The coati (Nasua nasua, Linnaeus, 1766) is a mammal of the Procyonidae family that belongs to South American wildlife and is one of the most common wild animals of Brazilian fauna [3] . This species is included in the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as \"Least Concern (LC)\" to the risk of extinction and is not included in the Brazilian list of endangered species [4] . In recent years, the populations of coatis have increased considerably due to the tolerance of the species to anthropogenic disturbances. In urban areas, they find food in the garbage, residences, and parks [5] .",

The CPV-2 genome is approximately 5.2 kb and encodes four proteins, two structural (VP1 and VP2/ VP3), and two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) [6] . CPV-2 emerged in the mid-1970s as a variant of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) that adapted to the canine host after acquiring mutations, which allowed it to bind to canine transferrin receptor type 1 (TfR), causing a pandemic infection in dogs around the world. However, CPV-2 was quickly replaced with a new highly virulent variant with some nucleotide (nt) changes in the gene encoding the VP2 coat protein, called CPV-2a [10, 11] . Wild carnivores were important as an intermediate host in the evolution of CPV-2 [12] . Raccoon (Procyon lotor), a member of the Procyonidae family, is known to be important in the evolution of CPV-2 to CPV-2a [13] . Despite this, CPV-2 had not yet been found in any other species of the same family. Additional evolutions in dogs were responsible for the generation of two new genetic and antigenic variants, CPV-2b and CPV-2c [11] .",

The isolation of a population in a controlled space triggers the increase in inbreeding and consequently leads to an extreme monomorphism; however, this may increase the vulnerability of the animals to infectious diseases [16] . Furthermore, the coexistence between domestic and wild animals has increased in recent decades as a consequence of anthropic impacts, such as ecosystem fragmentation and advances in farming, facilitating the crossspecies transmission of viral pathogens [2] .",

            "text": "Wild carnivores were essential for the emergence and evolution of CPV-2 because several species are reservoirs of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [17] [18] [19] . CPV-2 emerged as a variant of the FPV-like lineage, known to infect wild and domestic animals in the order Carnivora, such as large and small cats, minks, raccoons, and foxes [20] . FPV acquired the capacity to infect domestic dogs after a mutation in the capsid protein (VP2) occurred, giving it the ability to bind to canine transferrin receptor and resulting in the CPV-like lineage [11] . Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to be one of the most important wild carnivores in the evolution of CPV-2 [13] . The raccoons are susceptible to FPV and harbor an intermediary virus (Raccoon Parvovirus) between CPV-2 and CPV-2a that was not able to infect dogs. However, after genetic and antigenic variations such as a mutation in VP2 protein (87Leu and 101Thr), which are suspected to be crucial, the CPV-2 variant was replaced by a new highly virulent variant, CPV-2a [13] . Raccoons were reported as not susceptible to CPV-like lineage infections, only to FPV-like lineage infections [21] ; however, recent studies have reported the isolation of CPV-2 in this species [19, 22] . Thus, although the importance of raccoons as key hosts in the evolution of CPV is known, until now no The analysis of the fecal samples of the coatis (Nasua nasua) from this study revealed the presence of CPV-2b in 8 out of 21 (38%) animals evaluated that inhabit a controlled space in Garden Forest Reserve in Palmital, SP, Brazil. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of CPV-2b in asymptomatic free-living coatis. Until now, only a member of the Procyonidae family, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), was reported to be susceptible to CPV-2 infection [19, 22] . However, the CPV found in coatis (CPV-2b) is different from that in raccoons. CPV-2b is considered a common subtype detected in the world population of domestic dogs in recent years, including in Brazil [7] . Studies have shown a positive relationship between the subtype circulating among dogs and wild animals, reinforcing the importance of domestic dogs as reservoirs of the virus for wild animal infection [18, 19] .",

Although raccoons are clinically susceptible to CPV-2, which leads to loss of appetite and severe diarrhea [22] , it is not possible to infer that CPV-2b can cause disease in coatis or if coatis are only asymptomatic carriers. The coatis were part of a mixed population of 21 animals of both sexes, different age groups (pup, young, adult, and elderly), and different aspects of feces (normal, pasty without mucus, and pasty with mucus), indicating that these factors were not decisive to the asymptomatic carrier state.",
