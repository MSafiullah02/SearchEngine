The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred after the onset of respiratory symptoms or before J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 of 15 COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions. Conclusion: Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.",

All studies were published during February and April 2020, with 61.1% of articles published in April. There are 6 case series 6-9,16,20 and 12 case reports [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] . The mean patient age was 53.6 years, with patients between 15 days and 84 years J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of age. Males accounted for 38.9% of reported cases, females accounted for 27.8% of cases, and the sex of 37.5% cases was not reported. In terms of COVID-19 diagnosis, 2.8% patients were suspected cases and 97.2% were confirmed cases. Table 1 Cutaneous manifestations are important in the diagnosis of various infectious diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome, meningococcemia, rickettsial diseases, measles, and scarlet fever. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] As COVID-19 has a tendency to produce asymptomatic cases for up to 14 days after infection, cutaneous manifestations may serve as an indicator of infection, aiding in timely diagnosis. In this review, 12.5% (9/72) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions at onset. Furthermore, physicians' awareness of the cutaneous symptoms related to COVID-19 infection is critical in preventing misdiagnosis of disease, such as the misdiagnosis of dengue as reported by Joob et al. 10 The mechanisms of COVID-19 cutaneous disturbances are not yet well known, but some common theories are prevalent. It can be postulated that the viral particles present in the cutaneous blood vessels in patients with COVID19 infection could lead to a lymphocytic vasculitis similar to those observed in thrombophilic arteritis induced by blood immune complexes that activate cytokines.",

A generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform) appeared to be the most common cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19, with 36.1% (26/72) of patients presenting such lesions on their skin. A papulovesicular rash (vesicles) was seen in 34.7% (25/72) of patients. Urticaria occurred in 9.7% (7/72) of reported patients, and the presence of painful acral red purple papules with or without vesicles was seen in 15.3% (11/72) of patients overall. Lastly, 2.8% (2/72) presented with livedo reticularis lesions, and 1 patient (1.4%) presented with petechiae. Of the 72 cases, lesion location was reported in 67 patients, with the majority of lesions being found on the trunk, hands and feet. Overall, 69.4% (50/72) of patients experienced lesions on the trunk. Additionally, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. The timing of skin lesion development ranged between patients, from development 3 days before COVID-19 diagnosis to 13 days after diagnosis. In the examined cases, 12.5% (9/72) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions at diagnosis or onset of COVID-19 symptoms, while 69.4% (50/72) of patients presented with lesions after the onset of respiratory symptoms or of COVID-19 diagnosis. The timing of skin lesion development was not reported in 18.1% (13/72) of patients. Of the 49 patients who developed lesions after respiratory symptom onset or of COVID-19 diagnosis, 74.0% (37/50) developed cutaneous pathology within 7 days, and 6.0% (3/50) reported lesions after 7 days. Of the 50 cases with reported healing times, 100% of patients reported healing of cutaneous lesions, with healing times up to 10 days. 48.0% of lesions healed within 7 days (24/50) and 50.0% of lesions healed after 7 days (25/50), and healing time was unspecified for one case (2.0%).Five studies reported on the possible association between COVID-19 and skin lesion severity in 23 patients. In 21 patients (91.3%), the severity of cutaneous lesions was unlikely to be or was not correlated with COVID-19 severity. Contrarily, in 2 separate reports by Mah\u00e913 and Est\u00e9banez 15 , COVID-19 and skin lesion severity were linked in 2 patients (8.7%). Also, in most of the included studies, histological findings were not reported.",

In this review, we summarized the information of all the 72 COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations, as reported in the literature (Table 1).The most prominent case study of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 published by Recalcati et al. 7 in Lombardy, Italy included 88 patients. In this study, 20.4% of the confirmed COVID-19 patients (18/88) had developed cutaneous manifestations. It was found that most cutaneous presentations were erythematous rash (77.8% or 14/18) with few cases of urticaria (16.7% or 3/18) and vesicle formation (5.6% or 1/18). These findings reflect a similar distribution of cutaneous manifestations as seen in our review.",

Due to limitations in the availability of COVID-19 literature, the recency of the COVID-19 outbreak, and language-related exclusion criteria, this paper only examines 72 cases of COVID-19 related cutaneous pathologies. Lastly, we must take into account the possibility of dermatologic side effects experienced from medications used by participants. Given the current collection of evidence, it is suggested that COVID-19 can have dermatological manifestations. As a result, physicians should be aware of these important clinical manifestations that may aid in the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
