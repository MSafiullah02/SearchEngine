It accounts for 1\u20132% of all ambulatory visits and causes missed days from work and school [1, 2]. The cause is typically infectious in etiology, with viruses being most common pathogens involved, followed by bacteria, fungi, and rarely parasites. Noninfectious conditions may cause pharyngitis, and if symptoms are not self-limiting or do not respond to appropriate medical treatment, they should be considered. Symptoms range from a mild sore throat lasting for several days to severe manifestations that threaten the patency of the airway. Deep neck space infections can also extend directly into the mediastinum or the lungs causing life-threatening mediastinitis or pneumonia, underscoring the importance of early recognition and treatment.",

The peritonsillar space is comprised of loose areolar connective tissue in most individuals, but the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve courses through it in a minority as an anatomic variant. The peritonsillar space communicates with the parapharyngeal space. Parapharyngeal spaceThis anatomic space is traditionally described as an inverted pyramid lateral to the peritonsillar space and nasopharyngeal cavity. It is bound superiorly by the base of the skull, inferiorly by the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, anteriorly by the pterygomandibular raphe and medial pterygoid, posteriorly by the cervical vertebrae and paravertebral muscles, and laterally by the parotid gland. The parapharyngeal space is further divided into pre- and post-styloid compartments by a band of fascia called the aponeurosis of Zuckerkandl and Testut, which connects the styloid process of the temporal bone to the tensor veli palatini. The pre-styloid compartment contains fat, muscles, lymph nodes, the deep lobe of the parotid gland, the internal maxillary branch of the external carotid artery, and several branches of cranial nerves. The post-styloid compartment contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, sympathetic chain, lymph nodes, and cranial nerves IX through XII. This space communicates with the submandibular space, peritonsillar space, retropharyngeal space, and sublingual space. Retropharyngeal spaceAs its name implies, this anatomic space lies posterior to the pharynx. It is bound anteriorly by the visceral division of the middle cervical fascia, posteriorly by the alar division of the deep cervical fascia, laterally by the carotid sheaths, superiorly by the skull base, and inferiorly to the mediastinum. This space typically only contains loose areolar connective tissue and lymph nodes, but may contain the internal carotid arteries as an anatomic variant referred to as retropharyngeal carotids. Infections in this space are particularly concerning due to their ability to spread inferiorly to the mediastinum or superiorly to the skull base. The retropharyngeal space communicates with the parapharyngeal space. Danger spaceThis anatomic space lies just posterior to the retropharyngeal space, and like the retropharyngeal space, it extends from the skull base to the mediastinum. It is bound posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia and laterally by the transverse processes of the vertebrae. It is called the \u201cdanger space\u201d because bacterial infections in this area can spread to the thorax very quickly. Prevertebral spaceThis anatomic space lies posterior to the prevertebral fascia and danger space and extends\nfrom the skull base to the coccyx. It is bound posteriorly by the vertebral bodies and laterally by the transverse processes of the vertebrae. It contains muscles, the vertebral arteries and veins, and the phrenic nerve and roots of the brachial plexus. Submandibular spaceThis anatomic space is bound anteriorly by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, posteriorly by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, medially and superiorly by the mylohyoid muscle, laterally by the platysma, and inferiorly by the hyoid bone. It contains the submandibular gland, lymph nodes, facial vessels, and hypoglossal nerve. It communicates with the parapharyngeal and sublingual spaces. Sublingual spaceThese anatomic paired spaces are each bound superiorly by the floor of the mouth, inferiorly by the mylohyoid muscle, anteriorly and laterally by the mandible, posteriorly by the hyoid bone, and medially by extrinsic muscles of the tongue. They communicate with each other beneath the lingual frenulum, and they communicate with the submandibular and parapharyngeal spaces. Masticator spaceThis anatomic space is bound medially by the fascia medial to the pterygoid muscles, laterally by the mandibular ramus, superiorly by the base of the skull, inferiorly by the lower border of the mandible, anteriorly by the pterygomandibular raphe, and posteriorly by the parotid gland. It is subdivided into the masseteric\nand pterygoid spaces, which are delineated by the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. The masticator space contains muscles of mastication, the ramus and posterior body of the mandible, the inferior alveolar nerve, and the internal maxillary branch of the external carotid artery. This space communicates with the parapharyngeal space, submandibular space, and sublingual spaces.\n",

The initial approach to a patient with suspected pharyngitis or parapharyngeal space infection, however, should always include a careful assessment for signs of airway compromise. Findings of concern include respiratory distress, drooling, orthopnea, muffled speech (\u201chot potato voice\u201d), difficulty turning the head, and elevation of the tongue and floor of the mouth. A patient in acute distress due to a retropharyngeal abscess, for example, may exhibit opisthotonic posturing with neck hyperextension. These findings should prompt immediate transfer to an emergency department for evaluation with flexible laryngoscopy, if expertise is available. In extreme cases, emergency endotracheal intubation or surgical interventions are necessary to establish and protect the airway. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics should also be administered as soon as possible in critical patients. The laboratory evaluation typically includes a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic), and pharyngeal, laryngeal, tracheal, or epiglottis cultures for those undergoing a procedure that protects their airway. Imaging should be deferred for the critically ill patient until their airway has been secured. The recognition of and immediate intervention for a compromised airway are always the top priority (airway, breathing, circulation, in that order).",

Symptoms that are more prominent on one side suggest the presence of an abscess or phlegmon. The presence or absence of underlying chronic medical conditions, particularly those that are associated with immunosuppression such as diabetes, HIV infection, collagen vascular diseases, or malignancy, should be determined. A recent history of dental work, endotracheal intubation, surgery on the upper aerodigestive tract, and/or penetrating neck trauma is also important to obtain [\u25ba Call Out Box 5.1].",

For example, exudative pharyngitis is a classic finding in patients with infectious mononucleosis, a syndrome most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The syndrome is diagnosed clinically in patients with exudative pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Fevers are common and can persist for 3 weeks or longer. Patients with infectious mononucleosis also complain of extreme fatigue, sometimes lasting for months. The diagnosis of EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis is confirmed serologically by testing for IgM and IgG antibodies against the EBV viral capsid antigen (EBV VCA IgM and IgG). The detection of EBV VCA IgM is consistent with acute EBV infection. A rapid screening test for EBV infection, the serum heterophil antibody assay, is still used commonly. Results should be interpreted with caution since the assay is both less sensitive and less specific than antibody testing. Treatment for EBV infection is primarily supportive care. In severe cases, the combination of pronounced pharyngeal swelling and impressive cervical adenopathy may lead to concerns for impending airway compromise. Under such circumstance, systemic glucocorticoids can be administered to reduce the swelling, perhaps avoiding the need for a medical or surgical procedure to maintain airway patency. The use of glucocorticoids should otherwise be avoided because of their immunosuppressive activity.",

The syndrome is characterized by self-limiting fevers, malaise, myalgias, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy occurring several days to several weeks after exposure. HIV should, therefore, be suspected in all patients who present with an infectious mononucleosis syndrome. The diagnosis of HIV infection is made using combined, fourth-generation tests designed to detect both HIV-specific antibodies and HIV p24 antigen. Patients who are infected recently, who have not yet seroconverted by making anti-HIV antibodies, often have detectable circulating HIV p24 antigen. A major advantage of fourth-generation testing is the ability to detect HIV p24 antigen and diagnose HIV infection as early as 1 week after exposure. The earliest detectable anti-HIV antibody is present after 2\u20134 weeks.",

In contrast, primary oral HSV infection in adolescents and adults most commonly presents as severe pharyngitis. Since vesicles are not always present, it is likely that a substantial number of such cases go undiagnosed. The diagnosis of HSV pharyngitis (or gingivostomatitis) is made either by HSV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing or by viral culture of material collected by swabbing the affected mucous membranes. In immunocompetent patients, oral HSV infections will eventually resolve spontaneously; however, outpatient treatment of antiviral medication acyclovir, or one of its derivatives, offers the potential to reduce symptoms, reduce virus shedding, and hasten recovery.

When herpangina is associated with a maculopapular or vesicular rash of the hands and feet, it is referred to as hand, foot, and mouth disease. Among the enteroviruses that cause herpangina with or without the rash, coxsackie A16 is the most notorious because it continues to be responsible for a large number of pediatric cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease each summer during enterovirus season.

Thrush leads to white, cheese-like plaques on the tongue and buccal mucosa that are not easily scraped away. Some bleeding may occur if scrapings are done for diagnostic purposes. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis is made clinically; however if scrapings of the affected area are cultured, the yeast or a related Candida species is recovered. Two less typical presentations of oral candidiasis include the erythematous and the chronic hyperplastic types. Erythematous oral candidiasis presents with a red, very sore oropharyngeal cavity, while chronic hyperplastic candidiasis presents with leukoplakia at the corners of the mouth and tongue. C. albicans is a normal flora of the human skin and mucous membranes. When there is a disturbance in immune function or an imbalance in the usual bacteria flora, as occurs with antibiotic use, C. albicans can cause infection. Thrush is quite common during the first few months of life, at least in part because of the immaturity of the newborn\u2019s cellular immune function. In almost every other instance, C. albicans requires a conditional opportunity to cause an opportunistic infection. Patients who are being treated with long-term antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications, including glucocorticoids, and those with primary and acquired immune deficiencies commonly develop thrush. Untreated, the infection can progress and extend to posterior pharyngeal cavity structures, the esophagus, and the airway. Pharyngitis secondary to candidiasis can be extremely painful causing severe dysphagia. When oral candidiasis progresses to visibly involve the structures of the posterior oropharyngeal cavity, it is important to consider that it may have also spread to the esophagus, larynx, or trachea. Direct visualization using nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy may be indicated.

Clinically, streptococcal pharyngitis is associated with fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal erythema, and tonsillar swelling. Exudate may be seen on the posterior pharyngeal wall and on the tonsils. Streptococcal pharyngitis may also be associated with the presence of palatal petechiae and a skin rash. The diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is based on both the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory testing. The Centor and modified Centor criteria (\u25d8 Table 5.3) have been used as diagnostic adjuncts to help clinicians identify patients who are likely to have GAS infection and unlikely to have a viral infection. A score of 0 or 1 on the modified Centor score indicates a low probability of GAS infection, and no further diagnostic testing or empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended. Score of 2 or 3 indicates the possibility of strep throat, so throat cultures are recommended, with initiation of antibiotics if the cultures are positive for group A streptococcus. A score of 4 or more once indicated that empiric treatment with antibiotics should be started while waiting for culture results; however, in recent years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) and national professional societies have since recommended against empiric antibiotic usage [\u25ba Call Out Box 5.2]. Antibiotics should only be used when cultures are positive [14, 15]. Overall, evidence has shown only a modest benefit of antibiotics in reducing the duration of a sore throat symptoms; however treatment is highly effective at preventing acute rheumatic fever and reduces the frequency of peritonsillar abscess formation [16]. Antibiotic treatment does not, however, reduce the possibility of developing post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GAS pharyngitis unless the patient is allergic to it. Amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative. Patients who are allergic to, or cannot tolerate, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics can be treated with clindamycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Unlike many other common bacterial pathogens, S. pyogenes has not developed resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to clindamycin is rare in most communities but well described in others. Occasional resistance\nto azithromycin and clarithromycin is also seen. Clinical treatment failures with penicillin and amoxicillin do occur despite the absence of antibiotic resistance. Such failures are best explained by failure of the penicillin pharmacodynamics, not by a resistance mechanism acquired by the streptococcus.\n\n",

For patients who do not meet these criteria, tonsillectomy may be offered. In addition, tonsillectomy may be considered in patients with comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea, chronic tonsillitis unresponsive to medical therapy, cardiac valvular disease, recurrent febrile seizures, tonsiliths, history of peritonsillar abscess, or allergy/intolerance to antibiotic therapy. Ideally, a tonsillectomy should be performed in the absence of an active infection to reduce the chances of a surgical complication such as postoperative bleeding.

These conditions typically arise from the direct spread of a less serious infectious process present in an adjacent space. Deep neck space infections become particularly concerning when compartments that communicate directly with the mediastinum are involved, such as the retropharyngeal, danger, and prevertebral spaces. Depending on their specific location, these infections can also cause significant airway compromise over a relatively short period of time. The underlying predisposing cause for deep neck space infections varies based on age. Children who develop deep neck infections usually do so after starting with pharyngitis, while the most common initial source of infection in adults comes from an odontogenic process [\u25ba Call Out Box 5.3]. The microbiology of deep neck space abscesses is often polymicrobial with a mix of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. \u25d8 Box 5.1 includes some of the more common bacterial isolates from deep neck space abscess cultures [11, 19]. Some bacterial species\nrequire very specific conditions in order to be successfully cultured in the laboratory and thus are not detected in standard cultures [7]. Evolving changes in the antibiotic susceptibility profiles for several of these bacterial types further complicate approaches to patient management [11, 20, 21].",

This condition refers to a rapidly spreading cellulitic infection\nof the submental, sublingual, and submandibular areas, typically due to an infection originating in the teeth. The swelling of the sublingual space displaces the tongue superiorly and posteriorly. The swelling impairs speech and ability to swallow. As the infection progresses, the patency of the airway becomes compromised. On physical examination, the patient has a muffled voice and appears distressed. Trismus may prevent examination of the oropharynx. The structures of the superior neck are indurated with a marked elevation of the tongue and floor of mouth. Ludwig\u2019s angina is a surgical emergency. The treatment priority is establishing a protected airway, typically by tracheostomy. Once the airway is protected, the infection is incised and drained and the area debrided as necessary. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are used. Ideally the dental source of the infection is also addressed, but severe trismus typically prevents access during the incision and drainage procedure.",

A CT scan provides excellent characterization of the soft tissues and bony structures. This is particularly important when there is a suspicion of an odontogenic source of infection (\u25d8 Fig. 5.9). Abscesses appear as areas of hypodensity with rim enhancement. Other imaging modalities, including plain radiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be considered. Plain radiographs and ultrasonography do not provide the resolution detail that a CT scan does, but may be useful in some instances. Panoramic radiographs used to evaluate dentition may also be used to identify odontogenic sources of infection. Ultrasonography allows for the possibility of concurrent evaluation and treatment of an abscess with drainage under guidance, although the inability of ultrasound to visualize deeper structures of the neck often limits its use. MRI is rarely used in the evaluation of acute head and neck infections, but may be considered in cases where extension to the skull base, intracranial compartment, prevertebral space, or other complications\n, such as thrombosis of critical vessels, are suspected.\n",

This can lead to bacteremia as portions of the infected clot break away causing septic emboli. The lungs are typically affected first. Patients with septic metastasis of infection to the lungs may develop pulmonary nodules, cavities, and abscesses. Patients may also develop septic arthritis, particularly of the knee, hip, or shoulder [32]. The diagnosis of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome is confirmed by performing a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck to demonstrate the presence of a thrombosed internal jugular vein. Treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics that include reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria. Some experts also recommend anticoagulation therapy. In rare instances, ligation or excision of the internal jugular vein may be necessary if the patient fails to respond to standard treatment [\u25ba Call Out Box 5.5].",

These complications are extremely rare and only described in case reports. When they occur, they are life-threatening and demand immediate attention. Similar to Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, carotid artery pseudoaneurysm or rupture secondary to infection occurs due to spread of the infection from the pharynx or parapharyngeal spaces into the carotid sheath. Unlike Lemierre\u2019s syndrome , this condition tends to affect nonvascular structures in the carotid sheath, resulting in Horner syndrome and palsies of cranial nerves IX through XII. Damage to the walls of the carotid artery may produce a pulsatile neck mass on palpation, and in the case of carotid artery rupture, an expanding neck hematoma may be accompanied by a very large volume of bright red blood coming from the oropharynx. Treatment involves protecting the patient\u2019s airway and either surgical ligation or embolization to prevent circulatory collapse from blood loss.",
