            "text": "Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito borne viral disease worldwide with an estimated 30-fold increase in incidence over last five decades [1]. With rising disease burden, atypical manifestations are also on rise, but are underreported and often missed due to the lack of awareness among health care personnels. These include neurological, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and other isolated organ involvement and termed as Expanded dengue syndrome/unusual or atypical manifestations of dengue fever as per the revised 2011 guidelines of dengue fever and are often life threatening with very high case fatality rate [1]. Atypical manifestations could be explained as complications of severe profound shock, associated underlying host conditions, diseases and co-infections [2, 3]. They might resemble co-infections like enteric fever and malaria thereby making the clinical decision more difficult and mislead the physician\u2019s initial impression. There is limited literature describing atypical manifestations of dengue fever in children. In this communication, the authors describe the atypical manifestations in pediatric in-patients with serologically confirmed dengue virus infection.",

It may occur because of factors like direct tissue invasion of virus (neurotropicity), cytokine mediated damage to the blood brain barrier, cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion due to prolonged shock, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction and metabolic derangements like hyponatremia and hypoglycemia [2, 12]. The neurological manifestations of dengue fever were first described in 1976 [13, 14]. Pancharoen and Thisyakorn, in their study, reported altered sensorium as the most common neurological finding followed by seizures and observed these findings in 75 % of patients with dengue shock syndrome [15]. Rigau-Perez et al. and similar previous studies have reported a high proportion of impaired consciousness at presentation and during disease progression with multi-organ involvement and high mortality [16]. Dengue encephalopathy has been reported to occur in 0.5\u201317 % patients with dengue [17\u201319]. In this study, impaired consciousness and seizures at admission were seen in six patients and among them there were four deaths (66 %); all had features of refractory shock and multiorgan failure, the most omnious sign for mortality with severe dengue.",

Another unique observation was that majority of the cases of severe dengue presented with compensated shock without bleeding and responded to fluid therapy and only 6.3 % developed complications. The most probable reasons being early detection of cases, availability of quick early diagnostic test like NS1 antigen detection, and timely hospitalization and increased awareness among the public. The bleeding manifestations also did not correlate well with platelet counts, and occurred in children with even normal platelet counts and platelet transfusion was given in children with severe dengue with severe thrombocytopenia. Coagulation profile was deranged in 13 cases (5.1 %) signifying the fact that factors other than thrombocytopenia like platelet dysfunction, consumption coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction are responsible for bleeding in dengue fever [34].",
