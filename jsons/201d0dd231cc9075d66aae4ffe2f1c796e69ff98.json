At this stage, minimum rotations may not be met, since cancellation of clinics and outpatient studies would affect the normal volume of patients that seek care in those settings. At the Stage 3 pandemic emergency status, while requirements such as adequate resources and training (including infection protection), adequate supervision, and work hour requirements are in effect, other common program requirements and specialty-specific program requirements are suspended for ACGME-accredited programs to allow for the flexibility of physicians in the clinical care settings. At the time of writing, a number of institutions have activated Stage 2 or are in the process of activating Stage 2, while some programs, such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston, have activated Stage 3 status, where both diagnostic and interventional radiology residents may be assigned to direct patient care settings outside of the department of radiology.",

The resident group assigned to home/distance learning may be pulled to cover a resident on clinical rotation who becomes ill or needs to be quarantined. At UCSD, to determine the assignments, the chief residents worked with the division chiefs to determine the minimum number of residents required to support the service, and the maximum number allowed to comply with a six-foot physical distance between persons, as recommended by the CDC guidelines (5) . Other considerations included the need for contrast and call coverage, minimum requirements for graduation, and underlying chronic conditions which may place the resident at a higher risk. At VMMC, residents working on site are paired each day with one of the radiology attendings on service, rather than assignment to a specific rotation, to adapt to unpredictable and fluctuating volumes. Assignments to procedural rotations have been postponed to support physical distancing and to conserve personal protective equipment. Due to the lower number of outpatient exams (cancelled elective procedures and screening exams) and postponement of procedural rotations, credentialing requirements for Breast Imaging Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), as well as ESIR (Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) competency criteria may have to be reassessed; as a specialty, we should look to the radiology RRC for guidance on the effects on these training requirements.",

As an ACGME requirement, all trainees must be trained in, and provided with, appropriate infection protection for the clinical setting.

These safety protocols are available from the institution employee health, infection prevention, and GME departments.

Residents should be empowered by residency leadership to promote the safety and health of others in the department, including technologists, nurses and assistants. Residents should alert involved staff taking care of patient's suspected of COVID-19 infection to take the necessary precautions.

To find the balance of on-site learning versus distance learning, soliciting input from different perspectives can be helpful.

Considerations such as the flexibility of independent study versus increased structure, adapting conferences to an entirely virtual format, and attendance/accountability were made to design a program that would ensure continued resident engagement in learning. Programs may elect to maintain regularly scheduled conferences and lectures by videocast, and supplement education by compiling additional resources for independent study. Table 1 ).

The RRC has reiterated that the goal of establishing the ACGME case logs was for evaluation of residency programs for accreditation, and not for evaluation of individual resident competence. However, the RRC notes that it is up to each program director in conjunction with the Clinical Competency Committee (CCC) to assess each resident's educational and professional progress regarding ability to practice autonomously by graduation. The actual numbers in the case log may be informative in this process, but should not hinder the program director or CCC in this assessment as an absolute barrier. Depending on the length of the pandemic and impact on case volumes, it is possible that certain residents may benefit educationally and professionally from prolonging their tenure to ensure full depth and breadth of case and procedural experience. The ultimate goal is to ensure that safe, competent trainees are graduating as a long-term societal consideration, and adjustments that may be made to resident promotion should keep this goal in mind.",

Chief residents can set up a daily resident chat to review cases, discuss educational topics, and connect socially. There are a variety of on-line resources that can aid in wellness (Table 2 ). Moreover, institutions may offer specific wellness activities that can be accessed by residents. For instance, at Mount Sinai, in-person meditation sessions have been converted to a virtual format that all are welcome to join. Residents and faculty also benefit highly from practicing self-care such as sound sleep and exercise habits during these times of increased stress. If there are institutional funds normally used to support wellness activities, these funds could be offered to residents for use during the pandemic to sponsor virtual wellness gatherings, or to provide small gift cards for food or snacks. Other accommodations can be made to diminish resident stress and support well-being. For example, to prevent contamination and to ease laundering of clothes, trainees have been approved to wear scrubs during the pandemic in all sections at UCSD. Accommodations should also be made for residents with additional childcare or family needs.",

Many trainees have also dedicated time and energy to research and educational presentations at national conferences that have been cancelled. \"Cancelled due to COVID-19\" is a suggested phrase to use on the curriculum vitae to capture an invited lecture, abstract presentation or educational exhibit at a cancelled meeting. Some national societies, such as the ACR, have restructured their annual meetings into virtual meetings to continue academic endeavors, and have converted all poster presentations into an electronic format. Residents should be encouraged to seek out virtual meetings and conferences, not only to supplement education, but also to foster connection and networking during these times of physical isolation.",
