Subsequently, the outbreak of this pneumonia quickly spread throughout the Hubei province, country, and world. This pneumonia was confirmed to result from a novel coronavirus infection according to whole-genome sequencing [1]. On January 13, 2020, the World Health Organization tentatively named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). On February 7, 2020, China officially named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as NCP. Later, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially renamed the NCP as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. COVID-19 is mainly characterized by pulmonary inflammation, which can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and nervous system [3], [4]. It can also cause fever, cough, and other symptoms [5], [6]. The clinical manifestations are similar to those of other viral infections, and thus differential diagnosis from other viral infections is necessary.",

A positive quality control, weak positive quality control, and two negative quality controls in each batch were used. When two genes are are amplified and the cycle threshold (CT) value is below the detection limit, the result is considered as positive. A single gene is detected in the influenza A and B nucleic acid test; when the CT value is below the detection limit, the result is considered as positive. The COVID-19 kit was provided by Hunan Shengxiang Biology Co., Ltd. (Changsha, China) and the influenza A and B kit was provided by Jiangsu Master Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China). The performance verification results of the COVID-19 kit were as follows: Precision test showed that the kit had good repeatability and the coefficient of variation (CV, %) of CT was less than 5%. Due to the consideration of biosafety, we did not verify the accuracy, but our laboratory participated in the inter laboratory quality assessment organized by Shanghai clinical test center, and all the results passed. The sensitivity of this kit is 200 copies/ml. The interference test showed that the 10% (volume ratio) of whole blood, nasal secretion, 10% concentration of Runhou tablet solution, 10% concentration of hydroxymethozoline solution had no effect on the test results. This kit has no cross reaction with cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and so on. The performance verification results of influenza A and B virus kit are as follows:Precision test shows that the detection repeatability of the kit is good, and the coefficient of variation (CV, %) of detection CT value is less than or equal to 5%.

Whether the viruses compete between each other requires further clinical studies. Our results showed that the detection of COVID-19 infections was concentrated between January 24 and February 9 and peaked on February 3 and 4, with no positive cases after February 9. This is because cases that in other parts of China were imported from Wuhan, and the state enacted timely prevention and control measured.
