Balancing the need for efficiency and cost 84 mindfulness with the need to educate residents and fellows in the operating room may be 85 challenging. One solution to this may be to utilize midlevel staff (i.e. physician assistants and 86 nurse practioners) to help with the increased caseload and overall throughput in the hospital, 87 and thereby facilitate attending surgeons' ability to continue with resident and fellow 88 education.

It is likely that elective procedures will slowly be reinstated in a staged fashion over 135 a period of weeks to months once the surge has passed. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified 136 pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, and there is no 137 definitive cure to treat the disease. This is problematic for all patients. However, the elderly, those with underlying chronic conditions, and those with weakened immune systems are 139 particularly vulnerable. From the early experience with COVID-19 in China, it was reported in a 140 recent JAMA article that those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% case fatality rate (CFR), and in 141 those aged 80 years and older the CFR was 14.8%. The CFR was notably elevated among those 142 with preexisting comorbid conditions-10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 143 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer 28 Because of this and the overall significantly higher mortality rate, the authors hypothesized that 155 surgery may accelerate and exacerbate disease progression of COVID-19 30 . As such, it may be 156 reasonable to initially restrict elective arthroplasty surgery to those patients without significant 157 medical comorbidities during the early stages of resuming elective procedures when there will 158 still be some degree of COVID-19 patients present in the hospital. This could minimize the risk 159 of postoperative patients developing severe disease should they be exposed and infected with 160 the Coronavirus. Analysis of US Medicare data reveals substantial regional variation in patients 161 at the highest risk, and rates of arthroplasty resumption may concomitantly differ. 31 As the 162 census of COVID-19 patients begins to diminish, it may then be safe to re-introduce patients 163 with more concerning comorbid diseases into the hospital setting to undergo elective surgical 164 procedures in parallel pathways of care. 165",

This approach is attractive because an 167 ambulatory surgery center located remote from a hospital might be better able to isolate and Regardless of the location of the procedure, it is likely that there will be increased 184 demands placed on surgeons to handle the large volume of procedures that will need to be 185 performed over the course of the next several months. Questions will arise as to how we as 186 surgeons will meet this demand and maintain quality care and safety for our patients, as well as in a day along with the case order is also important. A recent study demonstrated that surgical 202 case order is an independent risk factor for adverse events in arthroplasty procedures, with 203 procedures performed later in the day having a higher risk for arthroplasty specific adverse 204 events (but not for systematic adverse events). Significantly increased operative time, higher 205 cost, and longer length of stay were noted for fourth or later arthroplasty cases (p<0.01) 56 . 206 Taking this all into consideration will be critical to developing a safe and efficient 207 strategy for moving forward once elective surgeries are reinstated. Fatigue risk mitigation and 208 enhanced safety strategies have been outlined by Janofer et al. Key components include 209 comprehensive preoperative planning, promoting fatigue awareness, and taking intra-operative 210 \"microbreaks\" 53 . Some of the key applications of these strategies include establishment of 211 clear operative team roles, responsibilities and assigned tasks in a preoperative team brief, 212 reduction of need for extra intraoperative decisions, optimization of surgeon sleep, nutrition, 213 and hydration to maximize surgeon endurance, and establishment of a detailed backup 214 contingency plan 53 . Preoperative safety checklists are another procedural safeguard to help 215 ensure patient safety. It has been shown in multiple studies that performance of a preoperative 216 safety checklist reduces wrong site surgery, improves timely administration of prophylactic 217 antibiotics, and decreases postoperative complications and mortality 57,58 . 218 How to optimally balance the needs for processing a large surgical volume with patient 219 and staff safety will likely be varied and institutionally dependent. However, there have been 220 several reports in the literature outlining integral strategies to successfully yield high operative 221 efficiency and productivity. A paper by Attarian et al. reported improved OR efficiency and 222 productivity via improved communication, elimination of silo mentalities, enhanced team work, 223 and high-efficiency OR teams adapting parallel processing 59 . Implementation of these types of 224 strategies, particularly enhanced communication with anesthesia, OR staff, and central 225 processing for short turnover times will be crucial for high efficiency and productivity. One of 226 the more profound tenets identified in this paper for the success of the program was \"sincere 227 gratitude to the team players every day\" 59 This has occurred in part already on April 8, 2020, with the ABOS announcing changes to the 251 case collection period. 62 They had already allowed for time away limits to be averaged over 252 time.",

Multiple 173 systematic reviews have reported that outpatient arthroplasty is safe and effective. 47-49 In 2018, 174 the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, Hip Society, Knee Society, and American 175 Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons put forth a position statement supporting the notion that 176 some primary hip and knee arthroplasties can be appropriately and safely performed in the 177 outpatient setting with discharge on the day of surgery provided strict preoperative patient 178 selection, standardized perioperative protocols, safe discharge plans, and sufficient practitioner 179 and surgeon experience are maintained 50 .

Fatigue has been described as both physical and mental 193 weariness and has been shown to negatively impact surgeon performance 52 . Recent literature 194 has also described another component of fatigued performance known as \"decision fatigue\" 195 which describes a declining ability to repeatedly make critical decisions-independent of 196 physical or mental weariness 53 . A 2003 study of surgical errors by Gawande et al. found that 197 16 percent of self-reported surgical errors at three teaching hospitals in Massachusetts were 198 attributed to surgeon fatigue 54 .

In addition, clear communication with industry vendors 229 during this time will also be essential for ensuring the necessary instruments and implants are 230 available, especially if supply chains are disrupted or not fully replenished to keep up with the 231 heightened demand. 232 Temporary regulatory changes could help the nation's surgeons meet pent-up demand, 233 especially if surgeons have been sharing off/on rotations. In academic medical centers, allowing 234 more liberal overlap of routine procedures with resident assistance would increase efficiency. 235 Many programs have developed new active and remote resident rotations; guidance from the 236 ACGME and/or the RRC on tracking compliance with the 80-hour work-week during the 237 pandemic would help avoid multiple disparate interpretations. 238 Many patients are limited in terms of expertise with the technology to be reached 239 through telemedicine.
