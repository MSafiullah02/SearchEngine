However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT) images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 Chest CT images. Our study provides a promising deep leaning-based segmentation tool to lay a foundation to quantitative diagnosis of COVID-19 lung infection in CT images.",

Thus, there is an urgent need for automated segmentation of infection regions, which is a basic but arduous task in the pipeline of computer-aided disease diagnosis [11] .

Developing advanced deep learning models would bring unique benefits to the rapid and automated segmentation of medical images [12] . So far, fully convolutional networks have proven superiority over other widely used registration-based approaches for segmentation [11] . In particular, U-Net models work decently well for most segmentation tasks in medical images [2] , [13] - [15] . However, several potential limitations of U-Net have not been effectively addressed yet. For example, the U-Net model is hard to capture the complex features such as multi-class image segmentation and recover the complex feature into the arXiv:2004.05645v1 [eess.IV] 12 Apr 2020 segmentation image [16] . There are also a few successful applications that adopt U-Net or its variants to implement the CT image segmentation, including heart segmentation [17] , liver segmentation [18] , or multi-organ segmentation [19] . However, segmentation of COVID-19 infection regions with deep learning remains under explored. The COVID-19 is a new disease but very similar with the common pneumonia in the medical imaging side, which makes its accurate quantification considerably challenging. Recent advancement of the deep learning method provide heaps of insightful ideas about improving the U-Net architecture. The most popular one is the deep residual network (ResNet) [20] . ResNet provided an elegant way to stacked CNN layers and demonstrate the strength when combined with U-Net [21] . On the other hand, attention was also applied to improve the U-Net and other deep learning models to boost the performance [16] , [22] .",

Although U-Net can easily separate the lung in a CT image, it may have limited ability to distinguish the difference infection regions of the lung which infected by COVID-19. Based on this case, the deeper network is needed with more layers, especially for the encoding process. However, when deeper network converging, a problem will be exposed: with increasing of the network depth, accuracy gets very high and then decrease rapidly. This problem is be defined as degradation problem [25] , [26] . He et al. proposed the ResNet [20] to mitigate the effect of network degradation on model learning. ResNet utilizes a skip connection with residual learning to overcome the degradation and avoid estimating a large number parameters generated by the convolutional layer. The typical ResNet block is depicted as Fig. 2 Here the variable i is the D-dimension representation of the input image or features map. The skip connection is performed as the identity mapping, the output of the identity mapping will be added to the output of the stacked layers.",

Accordingly, we conduct the ablation study about the ResNeXt and Attention separately to investigate how these components would affect the segmentation performance. To ensure a fair experimental comparison, we conduct the ablation study in the exactly same experiment environment with our main experiments presented in section III-C. We implement the ablation study on two variants of our model: Model without Attention and Model without ResNeXt. Our model without ResNeXt is similar with literature [16] . We just use the M-R to represent it. The results are summarized in Table II , where M-A represents the model without attention and M-R represents the model without ResNeXt block. We can observe that both the attention and ResNeXt blocks play important roles in our model and contribute to derive improved segmentation performance in comparison with U-Net.",

It can help community to accelerate the speed of diagnose and accurately evaluate the severity of COVID-19 [2] . In this paper, we presented a novel deep learning-based algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 CT images, which is proved to be plausible and superior comparing to a series of baselines. We proposed a modified U-Net model by exploiting residual network to enhance the feature extraction. An efficient attention mechanism was further embedded into the decoding process to generate the high-quality multi-class segmentation results. Our method gained more than 10% improvement in multi-class segmentation when comparing against U-Net and a set of baselines.",

In particularly, in the case of a new disease, such as the coronavirus, the amount of ground truth data is usually limited given the difficulty of data acquisition and annotation. The model is capable of generalizing and adapting itself usingonly a few available ground-truth samples. A knowledge-based generative model [36] will be integrated to enhance the ability in handling new tasks. Another line of future work lies in the interpretability, which is specially critical for the medical domain applications. Although deep learning is widely accepted to its limitation in interpretability, the attention mechanism we proposed in this work can produce the interpretation of internal decision process at some levels. To gain deeper scientific insights, we will keep working along with this direction and explore the hybrid attention model for generating meaningfully semantic explanations.",
