Slightly more than half (n = 25; 53.19%) had at least another chronic comorbidity, besides diabetes. For the primary out outcome, among these patients, 9 (19.15%) patients had died, due to the development of organs dysfunction. Seven of these nine (77.78%) patients were male. The median duration from admission to death was 7.00 (range, 2\u201319 days) days in the non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (80.00[range, 49\u201395 years] vs. 60.50[range, 38\u201391 years]), and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses (66.67% vs. 50.00%). Palpitation (44.44% vs 2.63%) were more likely to be reported by non-survivors. Moreover, our data showed lymphocytopenia occurred in 30 (63.83%) patients, with a significant decrease (0.60[0.57,0.72] vs.0.96[0.63,1.25]) in non-survivors. Both total bilirubin (12.70[8.90,24.00] vs. 9.03[6.40,11.55]) and direct bilirubin (8.46[3.65,13.85] vs. 3.00[2.43,4.25]) were significantly increased in non-survivors. These were accompanied by significantly prolonged prothrombin time (14.00[13.60,16.20] vs. 12.80[11.85,14.05]) and increased D-dimer concentration (1.54[1.23,4.83] vs. 0.56[0.31,0.92]). On the other hand, elevated blood urea nitrogen (6.51[5.10,8.71] vs. 4.67[3.75,6.42]), serum creatinine (Cr) (96.50[80.00,101.00] vs. 71.00[54.00,81.00]), and decreased eGFR (65.20[53.38,75.72] vs. 91.60[72.19,106.89]) were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors. These observations were associated with increased serum potassium concentration (4.17[3.78,4.57] vs. 3.82[3.54,3.99]) in non-survivors. No statistical differences in the four parameters relating to blood lipids were found between survivors and non-survivors. Medications for treatment of T2DM or COVID-19 were not different between survivors and non-survivors. Additionally, a Cox regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent hazards of developing death, finding that age, FPG, and total bilirubin concentration represented the highest risk factors for non-survival in diabetic patients with COVID-19.",

However, the data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of diabetic patients with COVID-19. Most importantly, this study indicated that older T2DM patients with poor control of fasting plasma glucose and elevated total bilirubin are at increased risk of death.",
