The pathogen was named chimpanzee coryza agent because it was initially isolated from chimps with coryza. A similar virus soon was isolated from a child with pneumonia, and the name was changed to RSV, reflecting the tendency of RSV-infected cells in vitro to fuse and form syncytia. RSV is a nonsegmented, negative strand RNA virus that encodes for 10 viral proteins. Two subgroups of RSV (A and B) each with multiple genotypes may circulate during annual outbreaks, although it has not been possible to associate more severe disease with one subgroup or another on a consistent basis [2], [3].",

            "text": "RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants and young children with respiratory tract disease. The outcome of RSV infection varies from mild upper respiratory tract infection, which occurs in approximately 75% of infected infants, to severe life-threatening disease in a small percentage of patients [4]. Each year in the United States, RSV accounts for 50% to 90% of the approximately 120,000 hospitalizations attributable to bronchiolitis and 20% to 50% of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to pneumonia [5]. During the 17-year period between 1980 and 1996, hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in infants younger than 12 months old increased by more than twofold, whereas hospitalization rates for other respiratory diseases (pneumonia, asthma) showed little change [5]. Approximately 500 RSV-associated deaths occur each year in the United States, and most occur in non\u2013high-risk patients [6]. Outbreaks of nosocomial RSV disease on pediatric wards continue to be a serious problem when effective infection control policies are not followed [7]. Serologic surveys show that by 2 years of age, more than 90% of children have been infected by RSV at least once. Reinfection throughout life is common, indicating that immunity to RSV after natural infection is inadequate. Whether RSV infection early in life predisposes to subsequent reactive airway disease is an important but unresolved question [8].",

Premature infants and infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity constitute high-risk groups with rates of RSV hospitalization that are approximately five times the hospitalization rate in full-term, healthy infants [9]. Several factors place preterm infants at risk for severe RSV disease, including a relative lack of maternal antibodies, an immature immune response, and underdeveloped lungs with small bronchioles and reduced pulmonary reserve [10]. Transfer of maternal antibodies occurs mainly after the 28th week of pregnancy, so infants born before this time are likely to have lower antibody concentrations. In addition, maternal antibody concentrations to RSV show seasonal variation, and infants born in the early fall or soon after the start of the respiratory virus season are more likely to be born to mothers with low serum antibody concentrations [11]. A low concentration of antibody to RSV correlates with susceptibility to severe RSV in infants [12].",

In the United States, the inevitability of the RSV season is predictable, but the severity of the season, the time of onset, the peak of activity, and the end of the season cannot be predicted precisely. There can be substantial variation in timing of community outbreaks of RSV disease from year to year in the same community and between communities in the same year even in the same region. These variations occur, however, within the overall pattern of RSV outbreaks, usually beginning in November or December, peaking in January or February, and ending by the end of March or by April [15]. Communities in the southern states tend to experience the earliest onset of RSV activity, and midwestern states tend to experience the latest onset. The duration of the season for western and northeastern regions typically is between that noted in the South and the Midwest [15].",

Aerosolized ribavirin was licensed in 1986 for treatment of children hospitalized with severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection. Because of high cost and conflicting data regarding efficacy, however, this drug is not widely used. A vaccine remains the most practical means of reducing the burden of disease attributable to RSV, but it has proved difficult to develop an effective vaccine for young infants that produces protective immunity but does not enhance natural infection [16]. In contrast, remarkable progress has been achieved in showing the efficacy, ease of administration, and safety of passive immunoprophylaxis against RSV. In slightly more than 10 years, the field of passive immunoprophylaxis has evolved from clinical trials with standard intravenous immunoglobulin to the use of a RSV-hyperimmune, polyclonal intravenous globulin (RespiGam) to an intramuscular, humanized murine monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) directed against a conserved epitope on the fusion glycoprotein [4], [17].",

Household crowding seems to be another important risk factor for severe viral lower respiratory illness including that caused by RSV. As the number of household members increases, the risk of exposure to infectious respiratory secretions also increases. Numerous other risk factors have been associated with severe RSV disease, including gender (males > females), low socioeconomic status, daycare attendance, exposure to passive smoke, lack of breastfeeding, limited maternal education, and malnutrition. These factors have an inconsistent association with hospitalization across studies, however, and at most account for only a modest increase in risk [10], [21].

To date, 15 immunologically distinct subtypes of hemagglutinin and 9 distinct subtypes of neuraminidase have been described. If a new gene encoding for either neuraminidase or hemagglutinin is acquired, a new strain may begin to circulate. Antigenic shift occurs less frequently than antigenic drift. Antigenic shift has not been described in influenza type B viruses.",

Families with school-age children are twice as likely to experience influenza than families with older children, reflecting the importance of young children in transmission of influenza in a community. Influenza is highly contagious, and secondary spread to adults in the same household is common. Patients may be infectious for 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and continue to shed virus in nasal secretions for about 5 days after onset of symptoms. Young children may shed virus for longer periods. Annual outpatient visits because of complications of influenza vary from 6 to 29 per 100 children depending on the virulence of the circulating strain and the relatedness between the vaccine and the circulating strains. Complications from influenza infections are estimated to account for a 10% to 30% increase in antibiotic courses in infected children. In 2004, because of the high risk of influenza infection in young children, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics changed the recommendation for routine annual influenza vaccination to include infants 6 to 23 months old [23].",

When vaccine and epidemic strains are well matched, the vaccine confers protection in 70% to 90% of vaccinees. The optimal time for vaccination is between the beginning of October and the end of November. Vaccine should be offered throughout the influenza season as long as vaccine is available and until virus is no longer circulating (Box 1\n). Protective antibodies develop within 2 weeks after vaccination. The immunogenicity of a single dose of vaccine in young children is limited, especially if they have not been vaccinated previously or infected by influenza virus. Two doses of intramuscular vaccine should be administered at least 1 month apart to children younger than 9 years old (Table 2\n). The duration of immunity is likely to be less than 12 months, so yearly vaccination is necessary to boost the immune response and to provide immunity to new antigenic strains. Hospitalization rates secondary to influenza in infants younger than 6 months old may be greater than 10 per 1000 [25]. Influenza vaccine is not recommended for this age group, however, because it has not been evaluated in such young children. It is important to vaccinate the contacts of these young, at-risk infants. The most frequent side effect of vaccination is soreness at the vaccination site, which occurs in 10% to 64% of vaccinees. Fever, malaise, and myalgia occur most often in young children who have had no previous exposure to influenza virus antigens.Box 1Target groups for influenza vaccination\n1.Chronic pulmonary disorders, including asthma2.Hemodynamically significant heart disease3.Regular medical follow-up or hospitalization in the past year for any of the following:Metabolic disease, including diabetes mellitusRenal dysfunctionHemoglobinopathyImmunosuppression due to medical therapy or HIV infection\n4.Persons 6 months old to 18 years old receiving long-term aspirin therapy5.Women who will be pregnant during the influenza season6.Infants 6 to 23 months old7.Persons \u226565 years old8.Persons \u226550 years old when vaccine supplies are adequate9.Close contacts of high-risk persons, including household and other close contacts of infants <6 months old10.Health care personnel11.Anyone who wishes to reduce the risk of influenza infection\n",

Intranasal administration of vaccine results in a subclinical infection that induces immunity by simulating a natural infection of the upper airways.

The advantages of LAIV are avoidance of intramuscular injection and possibly greater protection against mutated strains than that found with TIV [23], [28].

            "text": "Type A influenza virus is capable of infecting numerous different animal species, including birds, pigs, horses, whales, and humans. Birds are considered to be the natural host of influenza viruses because all known subtypes of influenza A have been isolated from birds. Wild birds generally do not develop symptoms when infected by influenza virus. In contrast, domesticated birds, such as chickens or turkeys, often become sick or die when infected. Influenza virus survives in the intestine and is spread in the saliva, nasal secretions, and feces of infected birds, although fecal-oral spread of virus among susceptible birds is the most common route of transmission. Transmission of avian influenza directly from birds to humans generally does not occur. The first reported instance of human infection by avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred in Hong Kong in 1997. During this outbreak, 18 people were infected, and 6 died. Killing 1.5 million chickens in Hong Kong removed the reservoir of virus and helped control the outbreak. In early 2004, widespread outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 occurred in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. More than 100 million birds died or were killed to control the outbreak. In summer 2004, a second wave of disease due to H5N1 was reported among poultry in China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. If H5N1 strains acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission, this strain could cause the next pandemic. The CDC recommends testing for H5N1 strains in patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia or severe respiratory illness for whom a diagnosis has not been established and who have a history of travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to a country with documented H5N1 avian influenza in poultry.",

Although the most serious lower respiratory tract infections occur in children in the first year of life, symptomatic reinfection by human metapneumovirus seems to be common. Risk factors for severe human metapneumovirus disease are similar to the risk factors associated with severe RSV illness. Most cases of lower tract disease occur before 12 months of age, although the median age of human metapneumovirus\u2013infected children in one study of hospitalized patients was greater than the age of RSV-infected children (3 months versus 11.5 months) [35]. Similar to RSV, the incidence of human metapneumovirus infection is greatest during the winter and early spring months, although human metapneumovirus activity seems to peak later in the season than the peak in RSV activity.
