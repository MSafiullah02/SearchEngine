In order to determine whether additional lineages of nido-like viruses might be present, tBLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to search the transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for sequences encoding proteins similar to the main proteinase (Mpro), polymerase and helicase, or complete pp1b regions of the nidovirus strains Infectious bronchitis virus, Gill-associated virus, White bream virus, Cavally virus and Wobbly possum disease virus. The tBLASTn results were checked by using BLASTx to compare each result to the non-redundant protein database, and results that matched back to any member of the Nidovirales were selected for further analysis. This led to the discovery of a 35.9 kb transcript and 243 other fragments from the California sea hare, Aplysia californica, and a 22.3 kb transcript from Microhyla fissipes, known as the ornamented pygmy frog. Putative virus transcripts were then compared to DNA sequences from the same organisms by nucleotide BLAST, and no evidence of either virus was found. Together, these tests suggest that both nidovirus-like transcripts most likely come from RNA viruses associated with host transcriptomes.",

The produced maximum-likelihood tree was mid-point rooted to reveal two strongly-supported super-clades, consisting of four strongly-supported major clades corresponding to arteri-like viruses, toro-like viruses, corona-like viruses, and invertebrate nidoviruses (\nFig. 1). A Bayesian rooted tree (not shown) was also constructed using the same viral sequences, and it yielded the same four major clades, but with weaker support values on some branches and a basal position of the arteri-like major clade. Together these results suggest that the novel virus-like sequences likely represent distantly related members of the Nidovirales, but the tree branch uncertainty also demonstrates the limitations of these phylogenetic approaches in dealing with the extreme diversity of the sparsely sampled nido-like viruses.",

In the story, Leto turned some inhospitable peasants into frogs after they stirred up the mud at the bottom of a pool so that she could not drink from it. Based on the low sequence identity but high conservation of domains found in the Coronavirinae, it is our opinion that MLeV is a member of a sister group to all known coronaviruses, but still within the Coronavirinae. Based on our input, the NGS named the new genus Alphaletovirus in the pending proposal.",

Remarkably, the organization of the AAbV genome has several features typical for viruses of the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family (King et al., 2012) that could be contrasted with those conserved in the nidoviruses. They include: a) two in-frame open reading frames (ORFs; ORF1a and ORF1b) of the replicase gene that are separated by a stop codon rather than overlapping and including a nidovirus-like ribosomal frameshift signal in the overlap, and b) a single structural polyprotein gene (ORF2) rather than several ORFs encoding structural proteins. The 35913 nt long AAbV genome has a 74 nt 5\u2032-untranslated region, a 964 nt 3\u2032-untranslated region, and a short poly-A tail (Fig. 2D). Despite these alphavirus-like features, BLASTx analysis confirmed that the AAbV replicase polyprotein clusters with the Nidovirales, as depicted in Fig. 1. Each part of the genome is represented in 3\u201320 independent sequences from the TSA and EST databases available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as of November 26th, 2017 (Fig. 2E-F). The AAbV genome (\nFig. 3A) is the second-largest currently reported RNA virus genome, behind a new 41.1 kb planarian nidovirus described in a BioRxiv manuscript (Saberi et al., 2018).",

There was no a noticeable change in read depth at the junction between ORF1a and ORF1b, but there was a sudden increase of about seven-fold in read depth immediately before the start of ORF2 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ORF2 may be expressed from a subgenomic mRNA produced in relative abundance compared to the genomic RNA, as would be expected for a member of the Nidovirales. Numerous low-frequency AAbV sequence variants were identified in the raw sequence data, but none were consistent across all datasets, and no indels were consistently present within 1000 nucleotides of the start of ORF2.

The longest sequence match between the 5\u2032-untranslated region and intergenic sequence of AAbV is shown in Fig. 3C. It consists of six of eight identical nucleotides, which could form eight base pairs with a reverse-complementary viral minus strand due to the possibility of both A-U and G-U wobble base pairing. However, none of the available TSA or EST sequences showed direct evidence of a subgenomic RNA species, such as a consistently-spliced transcript, or a large number of sequence reads that stop at the putative transcription-regulatory sequence. This sequence AAACGATG or AAACGGTA needs to be investigated further to determine whether it functions as a transcription-regulatory sequence for viral subgenomic RNA production.",

This led to confident identifications of the NiRAN and a match for the divergent but functional 2O MTase domain of Gill-associated virus (Zeng et al., 2016). One other uncharacterized domain was also identified in both AAbV and TurrNV by protein BLAST, in the position where the coronavirus conserved replication accessory proteins nsp7\u201310 were expected (Fig. 3D).

Included in pp2 are additional smaller domains that have not been named yet, pending a better understanding of pp2 proteolytic processing. SignalP (Petersen et al., 2011) predicted an initial signal peptide at the extreme amino terminus, but after removing the predicted signal peptide and re-running the prediction with the \u201cN-terminal truncation of input sequence\u201d parameter set to zero, a total of six potential signal peptidase cleavage sites were detected. The identification of the nucleoprotein-like domain is based on a resemblance to the N proteins of Bovine torovirus and Alphamesonivirus 1, and to the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV N. The features the AAbV N-like protein shares with N of other established nidoviruses are an initial glycine-rich region that may be flexibly disordered, followed by a lysine and arginine-rich region from amino acid 2869\u20132913 that could facilitate RNA binding, followed by a domain predicted by PSIPRED (Buchan et al., 2013) to contain a secondary structure profile similar to that of the Equine arteritis virus N and the SARS-CoV N carboxyl-terminal domain. We did not find strong evidence to support the analysis of Debat (Debat, 2018) predicting a spike-like fold in GP3, but we concur with Debat in noticing that GP2 (and we would add, GP3) have a protein secondary structure profile that resembles an alphavirus E1 protein and the E1-like protein of TurrNV.",

We note that an in-frame stop codon separates the putative pp1a and pp1b of the molluscan nidovirus Tunninivirus 1, which was phylogenetically grouped with AAbV and Alphamesonivirus 1 (Fig. 1). This suggested that AAbV may use a translational termination-suppression signal as a way to control expression of the pp1b region. Termination-suppression signals are found in several other viruses including alphaviruses and some retroviruses, and typically consist of a UAG or UGA stop codon followed by an RNA secondary structure element, and the efficiency of suppression normally depends on the stop codon, the nucleotides immediately following the stop codon, and the free energy of the RNA secondary structure element (Feng et al., 1992). The pp1a gene of AAbV ends in a UGA stop codon, and the region that follows was predicted by Mfold (Zuker, 2003) to be capable of forming several related RNA secondary structure elements, of which the most consistently predicted is shown in\nFig. 7A.

In another construct, 42 nucleotides predicted to form one side of the predicted RNA stem-loops were deleted (\u039442; Fig. 7A). Mutation of the AAbV pp1a stop codon had little effect on readthrough efficiency (Fig. 7B), but deletion of 42 nucleotides predicted to be involved in RNA secondary structures appeared to decrease readthrough, and led to a smaller readthrough product as predicted.

MLeV encodes a potential slippery sequence at nucleotide 6085 (UUUAAAC) followed immediately by a UAA stop codon for pp1a. The region following the putative frameshift signal was predicted by Mfold to adopt a stem-loop conformation which may be part of an RNA pseudoknot (not shown), but further biological characterization is needed to determine the boundaries of the frameshifting region and test its frameshifting efficiency.",

Without the 5\u2032-end or any evidence of viral subgenomic RNAs, it is not possible to be certain how the 3\u2032-end ORFs are expressed, but these repeated sequences are evidence that MLeV may express its structural proteins from subgenomic RNAs in the manner of coronaviruses.

Of the eight proposed nidovirus families shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, four contain only viruses associated with aquatic hosts, two (Arteriviridae (Shi et al., 2018) and the proposed Tobaniviridae) are found in a mix of strictly aquatic and strictly terrestrial animals, and two (Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae) are in part associated with hosts such as mosquitoes and frogs that have an obligate aquatic larval phase.

A tentative categorization of nidovirus structural proteins, based on size, predicted transmembrane regions, and predicted protein secondary structure is shown in\nFig. 10. If correct, this would indicate that nidoviruses have a diverse set of structural proteins that includes a variety of possibly unrelated spike-like proteins plus components shared with Orthomyxoviridae (HA and HE), Togaviridae (E1 and the E3 structural serine proteinase), Flaviviridae (the capsid RNAse). This structural repertoire appears to be variously expressed from subgenomic RNAs encoding a single gene (as proposed for MLeV), giant polyproteins such as that of AAbV, and a mix of intermediate-sized polyproteins and single genes, as in the Roniviridae. Taken together, these observations suggest that structural proteins are widely shared and exchanged among RNA viruses, and that conserved elements of the replicase will be more useful than structural proteins for anyone trying to construct trees that connect viruses at taxonomic ranks above the family level.",
