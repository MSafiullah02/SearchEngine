            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) provide the first line of defence against viral infection and play a role in shaping the adaptive immune response. Three classes of IFNs have been identified, designated types I, II and III, each of which can be distinguished according to their amino acid sequence and their receptor complex. Type I and type III IFNs are produced by virus infected cells and play an important role in the innate immune response. Type II IFN is represented by a single IFN\u03b3 in all mammals examined, is mainly produced by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and acts on macrophages, T cells and NK cells. Constitutive production of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells reflects a role for this cytokine in the early innate immune response. However, IFN\u03b3 production by activated T cells plays an important role in shaping the adaptive immune response to viral infection and establishing longer term control of viral infection (Schroder et al., 2004). The importance of IFN\u03b3 has been demonstrated in type II IFN receptor deficient mice which are susceptible to low doses of virus often leading to lifelong viral persistence (van den Broek et al., 1995). Among its activities, IFN\u03b3 is responsible for the stimulation of bactericidal activity of phagocytes, stimulation of antigen presentation through class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, orchestration of leukocyte\u2013endothelium interactions and effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. IFN\u03b3 also acts through the stimulation and repression of a variety of genes including the upregulation of a number of host antiviral proteins including 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, guanylate binding protein and adenosine deaminase (Boehm et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Bats belong to the order Chiroptera which is divided into two suborders: Megachiroptera (megabats), and Microchiroptera (microbats). Bats are the second most species rich group after rodents, making up approximately 20% of mammalian diversity and they possess a variety of unique characteristics that distinguish them from other mammals. These include their capability for powered flight, relatively long lifespans relative to body size and their role as natural reservoir hosts for a variety of viruses, many of which have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals, including humans but rarely causing any signs of disease in bats (Calisher, 2006, Wong et al., 2007). These include rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoV), henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah viruses) and Ebola virus among others (Leroy et al., 2005, Leroy et al., 2009, Swanepoel et al., 1996, Williamson et al., 1998, Williamson et al., 2000). Despite their array of unique characteristics bats are among the least studied of all mammalian taxa and there is little information on antiviral immunity in any species of bat and few bat specific reagents exist to study bat immunology. The few functional studies that have been performed on the adaptive immune responses of bats have revealed some interesting differences between bats and other mammalian species. Antibody mediated immune responses in several species of bats have been examined in response to immunisation with commonly used antigens and have demonstrated that antibody responses in bats are both qualitatively and quantitatively lower compared with conventional laboratory animals (Chakraborty and Chakravarty, 1984, Hatten et al., 1968, Wellehan et al., 2009). In vitro experiments have also revealed evidence for delayed cell mediated responses to T cell mitogens such as phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (ConA) and the B cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Chakravarty and Paul, 1987, McMurray and Thomas, 1979, Paul and Chakravarty, 1986). However, as these studies were crude relative to comparable studies in humans and mice, further studies are required to determine whether differences in the adaptive immune response play a role in the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats.",

            "text": "In an effort to understand whether differences in the antiviral response of bats are responsible for their ability to remain asymptomatic to persistent viral infections, we have begun to develop the Australian flying fox Pteropus alecto as a model species for studying host virus relationships. Recently we described a number of immune genes in P. alecto providing important information on molecules associated with adaptive and innate immunity in pteropid bats (Baker et al., 2010, Cowled et al., 2011, Cowled et al., in press, Zhou et al., 2011a, Zhou et al., 2011b). P. alecto harbours a number of viruses including Hendra virus (HeV) from the genus Henipavirus. HeV is capable of spillover from bats to horses and subsequently from horses to humans. Although HeV causes no apparent signs of disease in bats, it is highly pathogenic in horses and humans (Field et al., 2007, Murray et al., 1995). Paramyxoviruses including HeV are capable of evading the host\u2019s immune response and HeV has been demonstrated to antagonise the type I IFN production pathway in human cell lines (Gotoh et al., 2002, Rodriguez and Horvath, 2004, Virtue et al., 2011b). In bat cells, HeV has a similar effect on type I IFN production but is also capable of antagonising IFN signalling pathways (Virtue et al., 2011a). The role of IFN\u03b3 in antiviral immunity and in the control of long term viral infections in bats remains to be determined. Evidence for the presence of IFN\u03b3 in bats has been reported in an earlier investigation describing the in silico identification of Type I and II IFNs in the low coverage genome sequences of P. vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus (Kepler et al., 2010). Here we report the characterisation of P. alecto IFN\u03b3 and the development of bat specific antibodies critical for future investigations of the IFN\u03b3 response of bats to viral infections. Our data also demonstrate the antiviral activity of recombinant bat IFN\u03b3 on Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) and HeV, providing the first evidence for in vitro antiviral activity of bat IFN\u03b3.",

Chromatograms were edited manually using DNASTAR Lasergene SeqMan Pro version 8 (Madison, WI) and CloneManager Professional version 9 (Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, NC) and were compared with sequences in the GenBank database using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul, 1990). Potential transcription factor binding sites were identified using the MatInspector program (http://www.genomatix.de). All sequences were aligned using the ClustalX program (Thompson et al., 1994). Nucleotide sequences were aligned and gapped manually using Bioedit software version 7.0.9 (Tom Hall, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA), based on the protein alignment to retain codon positions. Based on the nucleotide alignments, phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour joining method of Saitou and Nei (1987), maximum parsimony and minimum evolution using the MEGA4 program (Kumar et al., 2004).

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify an 858 bp fragment of P. alecto IFN\u03b3 from the lymph node cDNA from a SARS-CoV infected bat. An open reading frame encoding the complete IFN\u03b3 sequence consisted of 495 bp, encoded by 164 amino acids (Fig. 1\na). This sequence has been submitted to Genbank (Accession No. JN656277). Alignment of the P. alecto cDNA with the corresponding genomic sequence identified in the whole genome of P. vampyrus revealed that bat IFN\u03b3 is encoded by four exons, similar to other species (data not shown; Savan et al., 2009). The 1200 bp sequence upstream of the start site of IFN\u03b3 in the P. vampyrus whole genome was also scanned for potential transcription factor binding sites. This analysis resulted in the identification of binding sites for transcription factors shown to be involved in the regulation of IFN\u03b3 in other species (Savan et al., 2009). These included GATA, BRAC, NFAT, STAT, OCT1, ISRE, IRF and NF-\u03baB among others. Given the close relationship of P. alecto and P. vampyrus, it is likely that these sites are also conserved in P. alecto. These results are consistent with the regulation of bat IFN\u03b3 being similar to other mammals.",

As shown in Fig. 2b, Western blot analysis confirmed that both the mAb and IgY antibodies bind to rbIFN\u03b3.

Although previous studies have provided limited evidence for reduced cell mediated immune responses in bats, the lack of immunological reagents has limited the ability to define the kinetics of these responses in detail (Chakravarty and Paul, 1987, McMurray and Thomas, 1979, Paul and Chakravarty, 1986). As an initial step towards understanding the cell mediated antiviral response in bats, we report the first characterisation of IFN\u03b3 from a Chiropteran with the identification and functional characterisation of IFN\u03b3 from P. alecto. This study demonstrates that P. alecto IFN\u03b3 is conserved and functionally similar to IFN\u03b3 from other mammalian species. Additionally we have generated bat specific IFN\u03b3 reagents for further characterisation of IFN\u03b3 and the Th1 mediated immune responses in bats.",

Both P. vampyrus and M. lucifugus appear to have a single IFN\u03b3 locus in their genomes similar to other mammalian species. Using tissue obtained from an individual P. alecto that had been experimentally infected with SARS-CoV, we identified a single transcribed IFN\u03b3 gene in our model pteropid species. Compared to other mammalian IFN\u03b3 genes, the P. alecto sequence shared greatest amino acid identity with the two bat IFN\u03b3 sequences from P. vampyrus (99%) and M. lucifugus (70%) and lowest similarity with mouse (44%). A number of conserved features were identified in the bat IFN\u03b3 sequence that are consistent with it being functionally equivalent to IFN\u03b3 proteins identified in other species. These include the six \u03b1 helical structure of the translated protein, the NLS and the KRKR in the C-terminal region that has been shown to be essential for IFN\u03b3 function. The NLS has been demonstrated to be conserved across evolution from fish and amphibians through to mammals and has been implicated in binding to an acidic stretch on the IFN\u03b3 receptor (Griggs et al., 1992, Savan et al., 2009). In common with IFN\u03b3 genes from other species, the P. alecto IFN\u03b3 sequence also appeared to be highly hydrophobic and contained a number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites.",

To examine the ability of activated T cells to produce IFN\u03b3, we examined IFN\u03b3 production by mitogen activated bat splenocytes, a rich source of T cells. IFN\u03b3 was transcribed in P. alecto splenocytes stimulated with PHA and to a lesser extent in ConA stimulated splenocytes. As ConA and PHA typically stimulate T cells in other mammals, these results are consistent with the possibility that the IFN\u03b3 producing cells in P. alecto are also activated T cells. Using P. alecto recombinant bat IFN\u03b3 as an immunogen we successfully generated a bat specific IFN\u03b3 mAb and a polyclonal chicken IgY antibody against the E. coli expressed bat IFN\u03b3 protein. A sandwich ELISA developed using these two bat specific IFN\u03b3 reagents resulted in the detection of IFN\u03b3 in supernatants from PHA stimulated bat splenocytes, thus demonstrating the production of IFN\u03b3 protein. Overall, these results demonstrate the production of IFN\u03b3 by stimulated bat splenocytes and the use of important bat specific immunological reagents. The production of IFN\u03b3 has been used as an indicator of cell mediated immunity in a number of species and as a diagnostic marker for disease. For example, IFN\u03b3 has been used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle (Wood and Jones, 2001) and a relationship between IFN\u03b3 production and disease protection has been reported in pigs infected with classical swine fever virus (Suradhat et al., 2001). The availability of anti-bat IFN\u03b3 reagents will now allow us to characterise the timing and production of IFN\u03b3 following viral infection in bats, providing information on the role of cell mediated immunity in viral infections.",

Only one report of IFN antiviral activity has been reported in bats with the demonstration that recombinant P. alecto type III IFN is capable of inhibiting the replication of the bat orthoreovirus, Pulau virus (Zhou et al., 2011b). To determine whether IFN\u03b3 in bats also exhibits antiviral activity similar to IFNs from other species, we examined the ability of rbIFN\u03b3CHO to inhibit the replication of SFV. Although SFV has not been identified in bats, it replicates to a high level in cells from a variety of species, including our bat cell lines. P. alecto IFN\u03b3 displayed antiviral activity in SFV infected kidney cells from P. alecto and in the lung cell line derived from the microbat, T. brasiliensis. Both cell lines responded to a similar range of IFN\u03b3 dilutions, thus demonstrating that the recombinant P. alecto IFN\u03b3 protein has reactivity across both suborders of bats (megabats and microbats). Bovine IFN\u03b3 demonstrates cross reactivity with closely related species such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat but not between different orders of mammals such as pigs and horses (Rothel et al., 1990). The close similarity of the P. alecto IFN\u03b3 sequence with the two other bat IFN\u03b3 genes is consistent with the cross reactivity of recombinant IFN\u03b3 observed in our antiviral assays. However, the lower sequence similarity with other mammalian species indicates its activity is likely highly specific for the order Chiroptera.",
