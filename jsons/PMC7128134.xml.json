The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has announced that COVID-19 is a category B infectious disease, for which category A infectious disease control measures are employed [2]. As the outbreak occurred close to the Chinese New Year, population movement and activities before the outbreak were extensive. Meanwhile, COVID-19 is infectious during the incubation period, and symptoms on onset are non-specific. Consequently, there was a widespread transmission of the virus, and the increasing number of confirmed cases has exceeded that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is serious, and epidemic control is a huge challenge. As a major tertiary hospital at the center of the epidemic, our hospital provided treatment for the first batch of infected patients in Wuhan. The Nursing Department of our hospital employed a series of efficient and scientific measures to obtain good results in epidemic control.",

The team immediately conducted an ideological mobilization within the entire hospital to ensure that all nursing staff would be aware of their responsibilities and obligations in the face of difficulties and the epidemic and prepare to fight at the frontline of the epidemic.

When selecting the head nurse for the quarantine ward, the emphasis was placed on disinfection and quarantine management experience, and priority was given to head nurses with good integrated qualities in the emergency and infectious diseases departments. The selection criteria for nurses were as follows: with two or more years of work experience, good physical health, and proficient in basic nursing techniques (infusion, oxygen ventilation, and condition observation). Candidates who possessed nursing techniques for critical patients (usage of invasive/non-invasive ventilator, transnasal high-flow oxygen, and closed airway suction) or disinfection and quarantine techniques were given priority. Hence, nurses who were dispatched to the fever outpatient clinics and isolation wards at first were mostly nurses from the Infectious Disease Department, the Respiratory Department, and ICU. At the later stages, the dispatch system was gradually expanded to staff from all departments.",

To ensure sufficient personnel in fever outpatient clinics and isolation wards, while ensuring nursing quality in the entire hospital, the Nursing Department reassessed and matched workload and personnel requirements in the entire hospital. The Department decided to establish three echelons, and the echelon composition principles were determined as follows: A certain number of mid-level staff must be present along with several senior or specialist nurses from the ICU and the Respiratory Department. In consideration of a large number of nurses (4,000) in the hospital, the Nursing Department referred to the concept of magnet hospital [3], staff selection was delegated to various departments in the hospital. Based on voluntary registration, the head nurse of each department dispatched the first echelon of support nurses according to the echelon composition principles and nurse selection criteria and then determined name lists of the second and third echelons as reinforcements for fever outpatient clinics and isolation wards.",

As the early number of patients in the fever outpatient clinics and isolation ward was highly variable, two reserve shifts were prepared for every shift according to elastic shift principles. Two groups of reinforcements for each department were preparing in case of insufficient personnel. If the manpower was still insufficient, the Nursing Department would dispatch nurses for support. To ensure nursing quality, the Nursing Department followed the management model of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital during the SARS epidemic, and four 6 h-shift model was used in the fever outpatient clinics and the isolation ward. The nurse shift schedule was changed every two or three weeks. At the later stage of the intensified epidemic, the infected patients continuously increased, and the manpower needs for the fever outpatient clinics and the isolation ward continuously increased. Then, nurses in the two key departments rotated once a month, and nurses had been working for a month would rest for two weeks and be quarantined at home. Only a part of nurses were replaced for each rotation to ensure the normal operation of the departments. The leaders dynamically adjusted the deployment of first-line nurses according to the epidemic situation. Any nurse experiencing discomfort would be replaced after reporting to the head nurse and the Nursing Department. In addition, to alleviate personnel resource shortage in other ordinary wards, personnel resource emergency plans were established. Meanwhile, all head nurses in the entire hospital maintained effective communications to achieve mutual understanding and cohesion.",
