By 2 April 2020, confirmed cases were consecutively reported in majority of countries in the world. At this time, the rapid spread of the virus had caused 896,450 cases and 45,525 deaths globally [1]. So far, the large-scale epidemic has not been controlled, and the number of cases worldwide is still rising. Therefore, the routes of transmission have likely contributed considerably to the rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It has been proven that the respiratory droplets and direct contact are the major routes for COVID-19 infection [2]. However, the route of fecal-oral and aerosol transmission, including through the ocular surface, have not been totally determined. Cutting off the route of transmission is one of the most important measures in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Whether the ocular surface is a route of transmission remains to be proved.",

The results revealed that virus could be detected in conjunctival swabs on the first day via ocular conjunctival route and then became undetectable indicating that the inoculated virus may transfer from conjunctiva to respiratory tract and other tissues. Viruses could be detected in nasal and throat swabs from three rhesus macaques 1 to 7 days after inoculation. Fourteen and 21 days after conjunctival inoculation with the virus, specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the rhesus macaques, indicating that the animal was indeed infected with SARS-CoV-2 [5].

However, the samples were taken from first, second, and third week of initial symptoms. Patients with asymptomatic infections can carry the virus at early time. But the virus in tears may not be detected after symptoms appear since the non-stop secretion of tear and drainage through the lacrimal system could reduce virus load on ocular surface over time, which could further lead to negative detection.",
