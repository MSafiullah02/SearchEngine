On admission, laboratory results showed a CRP of 175 mg/L, creatinine of 118 \u00b5mol/L and sodium of 167 mmol/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed infiltrates in the right upper lobe as well as bilateral pleural effusion. After discussion with the family physician further escalation of treatment was omitted. year-old woman received transfemoral aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis on March 23 rd 2020 in another hospital and experienced ischemic stroke during the procedure. In the course of hospitalization, she developed cough and fever and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab. CT of the chest performed on March 28 th was normal. Concerning COVID-19, the clinical course of disease was unremarkable and the patient was transferred to our hospital on April 1 st . On admission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Laboratory results showed CRP of 13 mg/l and LDH of 685 U/l. Fever and respiratory symptoms had resolved.",

Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia of 8.8 kPa on ambient air. CT of the chest exhibited beginning ubiquitous ground glass opacities with predomination in the right upper lobe. Treatment was started with 3 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycine as well as supportive oxygen. The patient is currently hospitalized on the COVID-19 isolation ward. Discussion So far, little is known about immunity after COVID-19 infection (2). Ye et al. found evidence for COVID-19 reactivation in a small group of cases with no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them (3). With recurrence of symptoms and positive PCR-testing after clinical remission and negative nasopharyngeal swab in the presented two cases, reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 must be assumed. Reinfection appears unlikely since COVID-19 infection rates were low in the region of our hospital and the trend of new infections declining at the time the patients were treated. These cases underline that caution should be exercised especially in vulnerable patient populations even after they appear to have overcome the infection. Close monitoring on an outpatient basis appears crucial.",
