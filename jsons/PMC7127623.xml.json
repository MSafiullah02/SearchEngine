Calves fed colostrum with viable cells had higher number of neutrophils and greater bactericidal activity than calves feed cell-free colostrum. The phenotypic profile of the calves that received cell free colostrum suggested a bias toward pro-inflammatory responses (Reber et al., 2008a, Reber et al., 2008b). Evidence of specific immune effects of cells from colostrum can be found in an increased of number of blood lymphocytes, enhanced proliferative response to antigen, superantigen and mitogens, and enhanced antibody production after stimulation with antigen in calves receiving viable maternal leukocytes (Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991a, Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991b, Donovan et al., 2007). Moreover, circulating blood mononuclear cells from these animals expressed a greater percentage of activation markers on their surface (Reber et al., 2008a, Reber et al., 2008b, Reber et al., 2006, Langel et al., 2015). On the other hand, feeding calves fresh colostrum suppressed B cells differentiation in the mesenteric lymph nodes relative to colostrum deprived calves (Aldridge et al., 1998).",

The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes peaked in COL \u2212 calves on D7.

The distribution of leukocytes was more in line with the typical profile seen in developing calves in the COL + calves.",
