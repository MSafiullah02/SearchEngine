Type I/II interferons (IFNs) are critical for generating cell intrinsic antiviral activity and hindering pathogens infection by inducing expression of a large number of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Liu et al., 2012). The human IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was recently identified as a new antiviral effector of the ISGs family. Overexpression of IFITM3 blocks infection of a wide range of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus, dengue virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, as well as one non-enveloped reovirus (Anafu et al., 2013, Brass et al., 2009, Huang et al., 2011, Weidner et al., 2010).",

Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis of IFITM3 and its other four human paralogs (IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM5 and IFITM10) reveals that they have two intramembrane domains (IM1 and IM2) and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), flanked by short variable N-terminal and C-terminal domains (John et al., 2013). The intramembrane domains and CIL constitute the CD225 domain that is shared by hundreds of CD225 domain family members (Punta et al., 2012). Brass et al. (2009) first demonstrated the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins using a functional RNAi genomic screen. IFITM3 expression accounted for 50\u201380% of IFNs\u2019 ability to block IAV infection and exhibited early viral infection restriction (Brass et al., 2009). IFITM3 potently restricts the viral entry by altering the properties of cellular endolysosomal membranes, thus creating an unfavorable milieu for viral fusion with membranes (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013, Feeley et al., 2011). IFITM3 further blocks cytosolic entry of viruses and the release of viral genomes, resulting in degradation of pathogens trapped within later endosomal or lysosomal compartments.",

FMDV has seven serotypes, A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3, with little cross-protection (Bronsvoort et al., 2008, Cao et al., 2013, Rodriguez and Gay, 2011). These make it difficult to prevent and control FMDV by current vaccines (Golde et al., 2005). Studies have demonstrated that FMDV is sensitive to the action of \u03b1/\u03b2-IFNs (Dias et al., 2012, Golde et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2012, Molinari et al., 2010). Inoculation of swine with adenovirus-delivered type I IFN confers 100% protection against FMDV-caused fever, vesicular lesions, and viremia and this protection can be maintained for 3\u20135 days (Chinsangaram et al., 2003). In addition, IFNs interact with cognate receptors on the cell surface and activate ISGs expression to safeguard the host through intracellular signaling cascades (Siegrist et al., 2011).",

Later, an acidic pH within the endosome is required to disassemble the capsid and translocate viral RNA into the cytoplasm (Johns et al., 2009). Ebola virus, IAV and VSV that exhibit similar entry patterns are inhibited by human IFITM3 (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2011, Lakadamyali et al., 2004, Sun et al., 2005, Weidner et al., 2010). The aim of this study was to clone swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) and examine if it could restrict FMDV infection. Our results demonstrate that sIFITM3 has a similarly functional CD225 domain and several critical conserved aa residues that correspond to its human ortholog. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 inhibited infection of non-enveloped FMDV in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells by disrupting viral attachment, and this differs from human IFITM3 restriction on enveloped viruses. Inoculation of suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 confers protection against lethal FMDV challenge. These data suggest that sIFITM3 is a novel and potent antiviral agent that could be used to enhance animal resistance to FMDV infection.",

These data indicated that sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal O/ES/2001 challenge in the suckling mice. One out of the nine mice in pCA group survived.

Antiviral IFN signal amplification is primarily effected by ISG, and many ISG suppress virus infection at multiple steps in the virus life cycle (Sadler and Williams, 2008). IFITM3 is a transmembrane protein that is mainly stimulated by type I IFN. It has been implicated in a broad range of cellular processes including adhesion, apoptosis, immune cell signaling, oncogenesis cell adhesion, heart development, germ cell homing, and repulsion (Siegrist et al., 2011). IFITM3 is also responsible for IFN-induced cell growth inhibition by transduction of antiproliferative signals (Brem et al., 2003). However, our data show that expression of sIFITM3 in BHK-21 cells does not interfere with cell growth in comparison with the BHK-eGFP, as previous studies (data not shown) (Brass et al., 2009, Weidner et al., 2010). More importantly, IFITM3 is a potent antiviral effector against a number of viruses infection (Anafu et al., 2013, Brass et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2010).",

Cholesterol aggregation can halt integrin \u03b12 uptake and prevent internalization. It has also been reported that IFITM1, the paralog of IFITM3, interacts with hepatitis C virus receptors CD81 and occludin to disrupt the process of viral entry (Wilkins et al., 2013).

Therefore, we postulate that virus attachment is not the only step that is targeted by sIFITM3 during FMDV infection. We cannot exclude the possibility that sIFITM3 also alter endosomes in BHK-21 cells in order to prevent the disassembly of the viral capsids and viral RNA release. We suppose that the 3- to 4-fold decrease in viral attachment associated with sIFITM3 expression cannot fully account for over 100-fold decrease in viral production.",

FMDV is a highly contagious disease among cloven-hoofed animals that can have a devastating economic impact on the international trade of animals and animal products (Carpenter et al., 2011, Yang et al., 1999). Our data indicate that sIFITM3 is a potent swine-originated factor defense against FMDV infection in BHK-21 cells and suckling mice. Therefore, we propose that this novel antiviral factor sIFITM3 could potentially be employed to improve animal resistance to FMDV infection.",
