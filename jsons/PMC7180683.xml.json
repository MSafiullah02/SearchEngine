            "text": "Stephania tetrandra S. Moore (S. tetrandra) is a traditional medicine used in China, Japan and South Korea. S. tetrandra is a perennial liana of the genus Stephania, belonging to the Menispermaceae family. The official name of S. tetrandra is \u201cFen Fang Ji\u201d in Chinese. \u201cFang Ji\u201d or \u201cHan Fang Ji\u201d or \u201cGuang Fang Ji\u201d or \u201cMu Fang Ji\u201d in Chinese is also usually used as the folk name of S. tetrandra. However, Aristolochia fangchi Y.C. Wu ex L.D. Chow & S.M. Hwang (A. fangchi) (Aristolochiaceae) and Aristolochia heterophyla Hemsl (A. heterophyla) (Aristolochiaceae) are two separate species also used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that are also called \u201cFang ji\u201d, which can cause confusion. A. fangchi and A. heterophyla contain high concentrations of aristolochic acids that can result in nephrotoxicity. When used medicinally, the morphological similarities between the two roots pose a potential identification problem that may result in accidental substitution (Tankeu et al. 2016). Thus, a comprehensive reference of available information on S. tetrandra would prevent confusion in its usage.",

Over the previous three decades, extensive chemical analysis and modern activity evaluation have been conducted because its traditional uses are of interest to researchers.

            "text": "The use of herbal medicines has gained popularity worldwide due to their long history of traditional use, their cost-effectiveness, accessibility and reportedly lower incidence of adverse effects (Mullaicharam 2011). Yet now the phrase \u201cChinese-herb nephropathy\u201d has recently attracted attention because the aristolochic acid present in a number of TCMs can cause nephropathy (Nortier et al. 2015; Meyer et al. 2000; Okada 1999). \u201cYao Xing Lun\u201d is an ancient TCM book from the Tang Dynasty of China that reported that \u201cFang Ji\u201d had \u201clittle toxicity\u201d. Although other ancient TCM books have labeled \u201cFang Ji\u201d as non-toxic, it is not suitable for long-term use in large doses. In fact, there are published reports that S. tetrandra has toxic effects in the kidneys and liver (Liang et al. 2010). It has not yet been established whether the \u201clittle toxicity\u201d is a result of aristolochic acids or the other constituents in S. tetrandra. To fully evaluate this traditional medicine, it is important to systematically review its traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological properties, and toxicity. This will assist in establishing the profile of therapeutic and adverse clinical effects.\n",

Meanwhlie, crude preparations or extracts of S. tetrandra exhibit numerous therapeutic effects. Such crude preparations have been in recent use to safely treat arthritis (Tankeu et al. 2016; Jiangsu New Medical College 2006; Sekiya et al. 2004), hypertension (Jiangsu New Medical College 2006), apoplexy (Jiangsu New Medical College 2006), edema (Jiangsu New Medical College 2006), neuralgia (Kang et al. 1996) and hepatic fibrosis (Sun et al. 1999).",

            "text": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that cepharanthine (25) (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 1.2 \u03bcM), and roemerine (52) (IC50 17.9 \u03bcM) exhibit significant antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values that are relatively low and similar strong activity with control compound (Chloroquine, IC50 0.7 \u03bcM) (Baghdikian et al. 2013). But cepharanthine and roemerine also displayed the stronger cytotoxicity against K562S cells at IC50 of 3.3 \u03bcM and 16.1 \u03bcM, respectively, compared with control compound (Chloroquine, IC50 32 \u03bcM) (Baghdikian et al. 2013). Although reticuline (5) and cycleanine (21) showed no stronger activity than chloroquine (IC50 0.002 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM), reticuline and cycleanine could significantly inhibit the growth of Plasmodium falciparum at IC50 1.18 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcM and 0.08 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcM, respectively (Fadaeinasab et al. 2015). Additionally, reticuline (IC50 148.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM) and cycleanine (52.96 \u03bcg/ml) also showed weak activity against Leishmania infantum in vitro (Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz et al. 2019; Gonz\u00e1lez-Coloma et al. 2012). Nevertheless, these investigations were conducted without the use of positive control and also lack analysis of its mechanism. At the concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03bcM, tetrandrine (9) has potent antimalarial effect on both chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodum falciparum in vitro (Ye et al. 1989; Ye and Dyke 1989). In vitro, fangchinoline (10) and cepharanthine (25) showed similar antiplasmodial activity (IC50 0.2 \u03bcM for cepharanthine, 0.3 \u03bcM for fangchinoline), but stronger antiplasmodial activity than the control chloroquine (IC50 0.6 \u03bcM) (Chea et al. 2010). Also in this study, fangchinoline and cepharanthine displayed stronger cytotoxicity than chloroquine to human THP1 cells (Chea et al. 2010). 2-Norcepharanthine (29) and cycleanine have strong antiplasmodial activities against P. falciparum D6 at similar IC50 about 80 nM compared with chloroquine (IC50 6.18 \u00b1 0.71 nM) (Angerhofer et al. 1999). The result of cycleanine in this study was consistent with that of Fadaeinasab\u2019s study (Fadaeinasab et al. 2015). Yet the cytotoxicity of 2-norcepharanthine and cycleanine need to be assessed. Northalrugosidine (28) showed the most potent in vitro activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes (0.28 \u03bcM), and the highest selectivity (29.3-fold) versus its general cytotoxicity against HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Naman et al. 2015). Meanwhile the reduction in parasite burden to the murine spleen and liver after the in vivo testing of northalrugosidine at 2.8, 5.6, and 11.1 mg/kg per animal when administered intravenously supported the idea that it could be further investigated as a potential new drug candidate or lead molecule for drug discovery (Naman et al. 2015). However, most of these studies lacked evaluation of compounds in vivo, and investigation of mechanism of action.",

            "text": "In addition to in vitro studies, tetrandrine (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg) has been found to be three times more effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum than against the sensitive strain in Aotus monkeys, having even greater activity when combined with chloroquine or artemisinin (Ye et al. 2013). Moreover, tetrandrine (20 mg/kg) exhibited an effect greater than albendazole against Echinococcus multilocularis and combining the two compounds (20 mg/kg tetrandrine and 50 mg/kg albendazole) resulted in a synergistic effect (Chen et al. 2002, 2003). Whereas the mechanism by which this bioactivity occurs should be further investigated. The combination of cepharanthine (21 mg/kg or 63 mg /kg) with chloroquine (30 mg/kg) or amodiaquine (10 mg/kg) was demonstrated to significantly improve the survival of mice and delay parasitic recrudescence (Desgrouas et al. 2014b). The mechanism by which cepharanline acts against plasmodia is to block the development of P. falciparum in the ring stage via down-regulation of Maurer\u2019s clefts (Desgrouas et al. 2014c). Notwithstanding, further research models are critically required to confirm this mechanism both in in vivo models and in humans.",

            "text": "Only two compounds, 9 and 52, have been evaluated for their antibacterial effects. Tetrandrine (9) (200.9, 401.9 or 803.8 \u03bcM) exhibited a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when combined with the multi-drug resistant (MDR)-efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide, causing a two to fourfold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethidium bromide against MRSA using a combined test (Lee et al. 2011). Tetrandrine at concentrations of 200.9\u2013803.8 \u03bcM inhibited both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), with a MIC of 401.9 \u03bcM (Lee et al. 2012). Meanwhile, it was demonstrated that tetrandrine-induced damage of bacterial cell walls, in combination with potential interference of cell wall biosynthesis via its direct binding to peptidoglycan, may underlie the synergy against S. aureus (Lee et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2001). Though the compound exhibited potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus, the required dose of the two compounds was excessive in these studies, the experimental data not being relevant to clinical applications. Moreover, the two studies lacked appropriate positive controls. Tetrandrine (48.23 \u03bcM), an efflux pump inhibitor as verapamil, could reverse drug resistance in 82% of isoniazid and ethambutol-dual resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but did not show a direct antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Zhang et al. 2015). Quite on the contrary, another study revealed that tetrandrine at 12.86\u201351.44 \u03bcM exerted strong direct tuberculostatic activity against 16 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in vitro (Vichkanova et al. 1973). Yet these investigations were conducted without the use of positive control, and the direct antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis of tetrandrine need to be validated furtherly. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, roemerine (52) (MICs ranging from 114.7 \u03bcM to 229.4 \u03bcM in vitro; the concentration of 20 mg/kg was used in vivo) demonstrated antibacterial effects towards methicillin susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains, and increased bacterial cell membrane permeability in a concentration-dependent manner (Yin et al. 2015). More importantly, roemerine (229.4 \u03bcM) showed similar antibacterial effects with positive controls of vancomycin (11.0 \u03bcM) and oxacillin (638.4 \u03bcM) in this study (Yin et al. 2015). The antibacterial mechanisms of roemerine (from 268.8 to 358.4 \u03bcM) demonstrated that it accumulates intracellularly, but it is susceptible to being subject to efflux from cells through multidrug resistant transporter proteins (Avci et al. 2018). Roemerine was shown to be effective against Escherichia coli in vitro (Ayyildiz et al. 2017; Gokgoz and Akbulut 2015). By assessing these studies, the concentrations of roemerine were too high to be considered antibacterial effects towards methicillin susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains (Cos et al. 2006; Gertsch 2009). Moreover, roemerine was not be evaluated for cytoxicity at such high concentrations in these studies. Additionally, cycleanine showed broad antibactericidal effects on Bacillus subtilus, Cornynebacterium diphtheria, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pyogenes at the concenrtaion of 1607.7 \u03bcM (Lohombo-Ekomba et al. 2004). As the same above problem, it is still somewhat doubtful whether the broad antibactericidal effects of cycleanine found at such high concentration are meaningful. Moreover, this study had other shortages, including no evalution of solvent activity and a single dose of cycleanine, resulting into lower reliability and absence of dose-dependent effect.",

            "text": "To date, the antifungal effects of S. tetrandra have principally focused on Candida albicans. Tetrandrine (9) (48.2\u201364.3 \u03bcM) exhibits synergistic effects with fluconazole against both fluconazole-sensitive and fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans (C. albicans) (Li and Zhang 2006; Lv et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2019; Benhamou et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2009a, 2013) and also directly inhibits C. albicans in mice (Shi et al. 2016a). Nonetheless, these studies lacked appropriate positive controls and adequately broad dose range. Moreover, the synergistic effects of tetrandrine should be doubted at such high concentrations (Cos et al. 2006; Gertsch 2009). In a mouse candida vaginitis model, vaginal administration of 13 mg/kg/day of tetrandrine also had a synergistic antifungal effect when combined with ketoconazole against C. albicans (Zhang et al. 2010). But, only a single dose of tetrandrine was used throughout the study, limiting the reliability of the dose\u2013response characterisitics. Moreover, this investigation was conducted without the use of a positive control. In addition, tetrandrine (20, 40 or 60 mg/kg/day) exhibits synergistic effects with posaconazole or itraconazole or voriconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro and in vivo, and the synergistic mechanism was related to inhibition of the drug efflux pump (Li et al. 2015a, 2017a). Magnoflorine (49) has demonstrated a substantial ability to inhibit the growth of Candida strains, as evidenced by a reduction in formation of a C. albicans biofilm at a MIC of 106.6 \u03bcM, based on microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing. Magnoflorine didn\u2019t have any toxicity to HaCaT cells even in 600 \u03bcM of treatment (Kim et al. 2018). The main limitations of the study are that high doses of magnoflorine were used and the study lacked a positive control. Compared with positive control amphotericin B (0.04 \u00b5g/disc), \u03b1 or \u03b2-magnoflorine (5.0 \u00b5g/disc or 10 \u00b5g/disc) showed weak antifungal activities against Penicillium avellaneum UC-4376 (Chen et al. 2009a). Furthermore, only a single dose of \u03b1 or \u03b2-magnoflorine were used throughout the studies, and thus limited the information on the dose-dependent effect. Roemerine (52) at 3.58 \u00b5M was also shown to inhibit the formation of a C. albicans biofilm in vitro, possibly related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway (Ma et al. 2015). The toxicity of roemerine was investigated in this study that roemerine had no significant toxicity using Candida elegans worms, three cancer cells and one normal cell (Ma et al. 2015). However, roemerine in this study was not observed to have a fungicidal effect against planktonic C. albicans cells. Another experiment showed that roemerine had antifungal activities against C. albicans in vitro at IC50 16.1 \u00b5M and MIC 35.84 \u00b5M, and no cytotoxic effects towards mammalian kidney fibroblasts (the kidney cells of the African green monkey) up to a concentration of 85.3 \u03bcM (Agnihotri et al. 2008). Nonetheless, this investigation was conducted without the use of positive control. Cycleanine at the concentraion of 3215.4 \u03bcM showed broad antifungicidal effects on Trichophyton longiformis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavis, Microsperum canis, Fusanum solani var lycopersici-tomato, Emoniliform spp. when ketoconazole or amphotericin B flucytosine or benlate nabam being the control (Lohombo-Ekomba et al. 2004). At such high concentration, the result of broad antifungicidal effects of cycleanine is unreliable, and also cytotoxicity assay was not investigated in this study.",

            "text": "Limited research has been published regarding the antiviral activity of the alkaloids and extracts of S. tetrandra. Fangchinoline (10) exhibited antiviral activity against HIV-1 laboratory strains NL4-3, LAI and Bal in MT-4 and PM1 cells with a 50% effective concentration ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 \u03bcM by interfering with gp160 proteolytic processing (Wan et al. 2012). Nevertheless, this study lacked positive control in vitro, which further compromised the quality of the study. Compared with positive control drug (zidovudine, EC50 0.045 \u00b1 0.056 \u03bcg/ml), coclaurine (3) demonstrated potent anti-HIV activity with an EC50 value of 0.8 \u03bcg/ml, and low cytotoxicity (IC50 > 100 \u03bcg/ml) (Kashiwada et al. 2005). However, an experimental animal model must also be established to further verify the anti-HIV activity of coclaurine. Cycleanine (21) has been observed to act against HIV-2 (EC50 = 2.94 \u03bcM) but it was at least tenfold less active against HIV-1 (Otshudi et al. 2005). Tetrandrine (9) (1\u201310 \u03bcM), dose-dependently suppressed dengue virus production in A549 cells by activating cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity (Liou et al. 2008). Although tetrandrine (intraperitoneal administration of 30 mg/kg/day) potently inhibited herpes simplex virus type-1-induced keratitis in BALB/c mice by modulating murine herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) development at least partly by modifying the host immune/inflammatory response to the virus in vivo (Hu et al. 1997), future studies should attempt to evaluate the toxicity of tetrandrine in vivo. In vitro, cepharanthine (0.21\u201326.4 \u03bcM) or its cepharanthine hydrochloride (0.01\u2013100 \u03bcM) demonstrated potent inhibiting wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) clinical isolates, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) (Zhou et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2004; Qian et al. 2010). The major limitation of these studies were only conducted in vitro, and lacked further study in mechasim of action. In vitro, cepharanthine had also antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, with IC50 values of the four treatments ranged between 9.9 and 15.67 \u03bcM (Zhang et al. 2005), but this study lack positive control and in vivo study. Tetrandrine, an L-type calcium channel inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit two-pore Ca2+ channels in the late endosome/lysosome and subsequently block Zaire ebola virus entry in vitro with an IC50 of 55 nM (Sakurai et al. 2015; Schafer et al. 2018). Tetrandrine was further evaluated in a mouse model of ebola infection and shown to significantly decrease morbidity, mortality, and viral titers (Sakurai et al. 2015; Rhein and Maury 2015). Still and all, the antiviral effects of S. tetrandra have not been studied in sufficient detail, additional research being required to assess the pharmacological and mechanistic characteristics of a greater number of its components.",

            "text": "Traditionally, S. tetrandra has been utilized as a TCM because of its anti-inflammatory properties. For this purpose, aqueous extracts of S. tetrandra are most commonly used. Such aqueous extracts and alkaloids of S. tetrandra (0.07813, 0.15625 or 0.31250 mg/ml) have been demonstrated to mediate against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 cells, through inhibition of the release of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 (Guo et al. 2015). Moreover, aqueous extracts and the alkaloids of S. tetrandra below the concentration of 0.31250 mg/ml did not exerted cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells (Guo et al. 2015). Interestingly, another study showed that total alkaloids from S. tetrandra decotion had the similar anti-inflammatory effects, mechanism, and cytotoxicity (Wang et al. 2016a). S. tetrandra extract, tetrandrine (9) (1.6\u201316.0 \u03bcM) and fangchinoline (10) (1.64\u201316.4 \u03bcM) also exert anti-inflammatory effects by interfering with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Ca2+ influx through G protein modulation to prevent macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) up-regulation in activated neutrophils (Shen et al. 2001). In the study, phytochemical analysis of S. tetrandra extracts was not conducted. Moreover, the study lack positive control, which further compromised the quality of the study. A lot of literature have reported anti-inflammatory effects of tetrandrine (concentrations of 0.1\u2013100 \u03bcM for in vitro studies, concentrations of 6.25\u201380.0 mg/kg for in vivo studies) by various signalling pathways, such as nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, etc. (Wu and Ng 2007; Xu et al. 2016a; Wu et al. 2015, 2011; Zhang et al. 2009b; Choi et al. 2000; Kang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2018b; Bao et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014a; Xue et al. 2008). In these in vivo studies, tetrandrine displayed equivalent or stronger anti-inflammatory effects compared with their positive control drugs, such as indomethacin, methotrexate (Wu et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018b; Gao et al. 2016). However, most of these in vitro studies lacked positive controls, and the evaluation of anti-inflammatory effects in vivo (Wu and Ng 2007; Xu et al. 2016a; Wu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009b; Choi et al. 2000; Kang et al. 2014; Bao et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014a; Xue et al. 2008). Fangchinoline (10) and tetrandrine (9) are the major alkaloids in S. tetrandra traditionally used to treat inflammatory diseases in Asian countries, including China, Japan and Korea. Both fangchinoline (4.0 \u03bcM) and tetrandrine (6.0 \u03bcM) have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects towards mouse ear edema induced by croton oil, although the two compounds have been shown to act through different mechanisms. The same concentration (12.5 \u03bcM) of fanchinoline and tetrandrine have demonstrated different effects on cyclooxygenase (COX), murine interleukin-5 (IL-5) and human IL-6 (Choi et al. 2000). Although fangchinoline exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory effect than tetrandrine, this study conducted without the use of a proper positive control. Tetrandrine (10\u201350 \u03bcM) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects through various mechanisms, including the suppression of extra-signal response kinase (ERK1/2), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), inhibition of the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (I\u03baB) and activation of NF-\u03baB (Kang et al. 2014). Although detailed research was performed into anti-inflammatory mechanisms in this study, a major limitation was lack of a positive control.",

It has also been shown to reduce activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (Xu et al. 2016a). Furthermore, tetrandrine (administration of 40 mg/kg/day) has been shown to suppress a systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, thus protecting against damage (Wu et al. 2015). Nevertheless, dose-dependent effects were not observed in each case and some of the investigations lacked positive controls. Tetrandrine (3.21\u201316.07 \u03bcM) may play an important role in the prevention of glomerulonephritis by down-regulation of ERK/NF-\u03baB signaling and inhibition of the activation of mesangial cells (Wu et al. 2011). Yet the authors of this study did not perform comparisons using a positive control. Moreover, the concentrations conducted in this study were lower than other anti-inflammatory effect studies of tetrandrine. Administration 40 mg/kg of tetrandrine not only decreased DNA binding by NF-\u03baB but also reduced the accumulation of leukocytes, downregulated IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production, limited the inflammatory response and thereby significantly ameliorated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis (Zhang et al. 2009b). However, the safety or side effects of tetrandrine were not addressed in this study, aspects which should be established via a toxicity study prior to use in a human study.",

            "text": "Reticuline (5) at the concentration of 0.5 mg/kg was shown to possess anti-inflammatory effects against xylene-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice and rats. The effects were mediated through inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression, by reducing phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and STAT3 (Yang et al. 2018b). Nonetheless, this investigation was conducted without the use of positive control, and also lacks analysis of dose-effects relationship of reticuline. Cepharanthine (25), cycleanine (21) and tetrandrine (9) (each at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml) significantly suppressed NO production, exerting anti-inflammatory activity (Kondo et al. 1993). However, only a single dose of these compounds was used throughout these studies, thus limiting data regarding the effect being dose-dependent. Cepharanthine at concentrations of 33.0 \u03bcM and 82.5 \u03bcM were also shown to inhibit chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells by reducing chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) production, resulting in suppression of inflammation (Aota et al. 2018). It\u2019s worth noting that this study also did not include a positive control. Meanwhile, this study conducted higher concentration of cepharanthine than that of Kondo\u2019s study to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity. Dicentrine (39) at the concentrations of 5.90, 7.52 or 10.0 \u03bcM was shown to suppress LPS-induced inflammation by blocking the activation of NF-\u03baB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in RAW264.7 macrophages (Yodkeeree et al. 2018). Although this study assessed the cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 macrophages, anti-inflammatory effects and the mechanism of action, these authors did not compare the efficacy of dicentrine with a positive control. Magnoflorine (49) (3.125\u201350 \u03bcM) enhanced an LPS-activated pro-inflammatory response by upregulating TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and COX-2 protein expression in U937 macrophages. Compared to the positive control of levamisole, magnoflorine showed weaker the 50% effective dose (ED50) values of 7.89 and 10.28 \u00b5M for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, respectively. (Haque et al. 2018). In an in vivo trial, magnoflorine (5\u201320 mg/kg) ameliorated acute lung injury induced by LPS by suppressing the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK (Guo et al. 2018). However, no clinical trials have been reported and so further evidence in humans is required to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of magnoflorine.",

Tetrandrine has broad-spectrum antitumor effects (Bhagya and Chandrashekar 2018; Liu 2017; Liu et al. 2016) in many types of cancer cells, including human liver cancer (Zhang et al. 2018a; Yu and Ho 2013), osteosarcoma (Tian et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2017), oral cancer (Lien et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2013), colon carcinoma (Meng et al. 2004; Li et al. 2019), gastric cancer (Bai et al. 2018; Qin et al. 2013), brain glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cancer (Jiang et al. 2019) and lung carcinoma (Chow et al. 2018; Cho et al. 2009). It also exhibits antineoplastic activity against gallbladder carcinoma (Zhu et al. 2014), thyroid carcinoma B-CPAP cells (Zhang et al. 2017a), prostatic carcinoma PC3 cells (Lan et al. 2018), esophageal cancer (Wang et al. 2012), breast cancer (Guo and Pei 2019), pancreatic cancer (Singh et al. 2018), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Lin et al. 2016, 2017b), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (Liu et al. 2017c), cervical cancer (Zhang et al. 2018b) and renal carcinoma (Chen et al. 2014, 2017a) cells. Although tetrandrine exhibited broad anti-tumor effects, a number of these studies lacked positive controls or anti-tumor evaluation of tetrandrine in vivo. It is a challenge to compare each other in quantitative data on these activities as a result of different tumor models and different cell lines of the same cancer.",

            "text": "In addition to fangchinoline (10) and tetrandrine (9), a number of other alkaloids in S. tetrandra have also reported anticancer/antiproliferative effects. Cepharanthine (25) was shown to possess potent cytotoxicity against a number of types of carcinoma cell, including those of the lung (Hua et al. 2015), breast (Gao et al. 2017), ovary (Payon et al. 2019), colon and rectum (Rattanawong et al. 2018). It also acts against choroidal melanoma cells (Zhu et al. 2017) and K562 human leukemia cells (Wu et al. 2001). These anticancer effects of cepharanthine are only in vitro investigation, whereas anti-tumor evaluation of cepharanthine in vivo need to be verified. N-methylcoclaurine (1) has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects against leukemia (IC50 < 10 \u03bcM) in studies evaluating its impact on the growth of murine leukemic L1210 cells, human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells and HL-60 cells (Tzeng et al. 1990). Cycleanine (21) with the IC50 values from 7 to 14 \u03bcM showed potential anti-cancer effects on various ovarian cancer cells by acting through the apoptosis pathway. Yet compared to the positive control, paclitaxel (IC50 values from 5 to 8 nM), anti-cancer effects on various ovarian cancer cells of cycleanine has no advantage. (Uche et al. 2016). Dicentrine (39) has been shown to IC50 values from 4 to 43 \u03bcM on different U87MG cell lines by inhibiting the over-expression of epidermal growth factor receptor cancer cells by intercalation of DNA and the introduction of DNA strand breaks. Unfortunately, this study did not use a positive control, which compromised the quality of the study (Konkimalla and Efferth 2010). In severe combined immunodeficiency mice, dicentrine (100 \u03bcg/mice) significantly inhibited the development of tumors in the leukemia cell line K562. Alternatively, dicentrine (14.7 \u03bcM), in vitro, could decrease the colony formation efficiency in both hepatoma cell lines, HuH-7 and MS-G2. (Huang et al. 1998). It is a pity that only one dose of dicentrine used in the in vivo and in vitro studies, and thus limited the information on the dose-dependent effect. And the dose of dicentrine should be used in \u03bcg/kg based on the weight of mice instead of \u03bcg/mice in the in vivo study. Dehydrocrebanine (50) has demonstrated strong activity against promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), with an IC50 of 6.35 \u00b5M (Makarasen et al. 2011). Though, the mechanism of action and in vivo activity need further assessment. Roemerine (52) was shown to anti-prostate cancer effect in vivo in the mouse model of prostate cancer, while in vitro inhibit the proliferation and migration of the following prostate cancer cell lines: DU145, LNCaP, PC-3 and 22RV1. It also induced different degrees of apoptosis, particularly in LNCaP cells (Ma et al. 2017). The shortage of this study was that only a single dose of roemerine was used.",

Reversal of multidrug resistance is an additional important mechanism of the anticancer effects of tetrandine (9) and fangchinoline (10). These two compounds are effective in overcoming multidrug resistance in a variety of tumor cells in a synergistic manner via modulation of P-glycoprotein (Choi et al. 1998; Sun and Wink 2014; Lu et al. 2017), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (Wang et al. 2012), multidrug efflux transporters (Yao et al. 2017), Akt/NF-\u03baB/matrix metalloprotein (MMP)-9 (Chen et al. 2017a) and \u03b2-catenin expression (Zhang et al. 2017b). Tetrandine has also been shown to enhance radiation sensitization for human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by modulating phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX), phosphorylated CDC25C, phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (p-CDK1) and CDK1 (Ding et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2017c). In lung cancer cells, tetrandine decreased the proportion of cells blocked at G2 (Ding et al. 2016) and also enhanced the radiation sensitization of esophageal carcinoma cells (Bai et al. 2015). To date, tetrandine is the only alkaloid of S. tetrandra which has been reported to enhance radiation sensitization in various cancer cells. As these studies of mechanisms were only conducted in vitro, additional researches using in vivo models with appropriate controls and doses are required.",

            "text": "Tetrandrine (9) and fangchinoline (10) are protective against the neurodegeneration occurring in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 10 or 30 mg/kg tetrandrine every other day for 4 weeks, tetrandrine has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in chronic vascular dementia by reducing IL-1\u03b2 expression, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B phosphorylation at tyrosine 1472 and neuronal necrosis (Lv et al. 2016). However, no positive control was included in these animal experiments and a dose\u2013response effect was not observed. In a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) revealed that tetrandrine at the dose of 30 mg/kg attenuated cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and induced differential proteomic changes (Ruan et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the experiment had a number of limitations, including having no positive control and a single dose of drugs, resulting in a lower level of reliability and no possibility of observing a dose-dependent effect. Tetrandrine at the concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 \u00b5M has also been shown to diminish the harmful effects of amyloid-\u03b2 protein on cell survival by interfering with signals of necrosis relating to Ca2+ overload through L-type calcium channels (Chiou et al. 2006). Furthermore, tetrandrine (0.1\u201320 \u00b5M) also protects against injury induced by oxygen-glucose-serum deprivation/reoxygenation (OGSD/R) (Bao et al. 2016). Tetrandrine has been shown to facilitate the neuroprotective effects of glutathione in a 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model in Parkinson's disease at the dose of 15 mg/kg/day (Li et al. 2015c), reduce phenobarbital withdrawal symptoms and protect brain cells against apoptosis at the doses from 6.25 to 31.25 mg/kg/day (Han et al. 2015). Tetrandrine can also alleviate pathological nerve cell damage (Zhang et al. 2001) and ameliorate A\u03b2 (1\u201342)-induced spatial learning and memory deficit in Alzheimer's disease at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day (He et al. 2011). Nonetheless, because the factors affecting nerve cell damage or Alzheimer's disease are numerous, the signaling pathways are extremely complex and the signaling molecules involved are in considerable abundance. Thus, the mechanism of tetrandrine in nerve cell protection and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease requires additional in-depth basic research including a search for factors that modulate the neuroprotective effects of tetrandrine, to explore related signaling molecules and pathways involved in the neuroprotective effects. Tetrandrine (9) and fangchinoline (10) over a concentration range of 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M have been shown to lessen the harmful effects of H2O2-induced neuronal cell death by interfering with increased Ca2+ concentrations, which inhibit glutamate release and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Koh et al. 2003). Yet this investigation was conducted without the use of a positive control. Furthermore, fangchinoline inhibited glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes by suppressing the activity of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, with an IC50 values derived from a dose\u2013response curve of about 93 \u00b5M, subsequently causing a reduction in the ingress of Ca2+ into nerve terminals (Lin et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2001). This investigation, too, was conducted without the use of a positive control. And the IC50 value (93 \u00b5M) was too high, which can not provide reliable experimental data for clinical application.",

N-methylcoclaurine (1), reticuline (5), dicentrine (39), dehydrodicentrine (51), roemerine (52), Stepharanine (54) and cyclanoline (64) have demonstrated inhibitory effects against AChE with IC50 value of 15.0 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5M, 33.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5M, 6.6 \u00b5M, 2.98 \u00b5M, 335.1 \u00b5M, 14.10 \u00b1 0.81 \u00b5M, and 9.23 \u00b1 3.47 \u00b5M, respectively (Ho\u0161t'\u00e1lkov\u00e1et al. 2015; Kongkiatpaiboon et al. 2016; Dong et al. 2015; Ingkaninan et al. 2006). Among them, roemerine showed the weakest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Compared with the positive control of tacrine, with IC50 value of 0.25 \u00b5M, the activities of these compounds are not strong. Investigations on potential mechanisms and in vivo study are required, since AChE inhibitory activity of these compounds was merely evaluated by analysis of their IC50 values. Stepholidine (57) at the doses of 3\u201310 mg/kg should be explored as a potential therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease because it acts through a mechanism that improves trafficking of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor and improves synaptic plasticity by activating the dopamine D1 receptor/protein kinase A (D1/PKA) signaling pathway (Hao et al. 2015). Nevertheless, this study also lacked a positive control and no analysis of dose-dependency has been conducted. These limitations put into question the reliability of this study.",

Intragastric administration of tetrandrine (60 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased the c-Fos positive ratio of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. It also significantly decreased norepinephrine in endogenous pathways that regulate sites that modulate the sleep\u2013wake cycle, such as the LC, hypothalamus and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (Huang et al. 2016). Yet the authors did not explore dose-dependency, because only two doses were evaluated in this study. Tetrandrine (100 mg/kg, administered orally) has also been shown to markedly improve sleep efficiency by increasing the time of total sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, including deep sleep and light sleep (Zhang et al. 2014). Unfortunately, only a single dose of tetrandrine was used throughout the study, with no investigation of dose-dependency. Moreover, the dose of tetrandrine used was too high in the study, it can not provide reliable experimental data for clinical application. In mice, tetrandrine (30 or 60 mg/kg, administered orally) has also been shown to significantly potentiate pentobarbital-induced hypnosis by reducing sleep latency and increasing sleeping time in a dose-dependent manner, an effect potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan (Zhao et al. 2004). In general, future studies should attempt to identify the mechanism of action of tetrandrine.",

These effects mediated by inhibition of inhibitor kappa B kinase\u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) phosphorylation. This has been shown to reduce the production of important pain mediators, such as PGE2 and COX-2 via the IKK\u03b2/I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB pathway (Zhao et al. 2014). In this study, tetrandrine exhibited stronger antinociceptive effects than the positive control morphine (10 mg/kg). In the study, further research models are critically needed to confirm such activity in-vivo and in humans. Dicentrine (39) (100 mg/kg/day, administered orally) has demonstrated significant antinociceptive activity in a mouse model of acute visceral pain. It also reduced spontaneous nociception and attenuated mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, probably via a transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)-dependent mechanism (Montrucchio et al. 2013). This investigation, too, was conducted without use of a positive control, and also lacked analysis of a dose\u2013response, as well as the dose of dicentrine was used too high. Though research on the antinociceptive effects of S. tetrandra is limited, these results compliment the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of arthralgia.",

In vivo, reticuline (50\u2013100 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) could produce alteration of behaviour pattern, prolongation of pentobarbital-induced sleep, reduction in motor coordination and d-amphetamine-induced hypermotility and suppression of the conditioned avoidance response (Morais et al. 1998). This study had the same shortage of lacking a positive control. Tetrandrine (9) (40 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) appears to be a potential adjuvant drug for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. It has demonstrated decreased cell resistance to phenytoin and valproic acid. It also reduced the frequency of seizures and increased the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs by reducing the expression of P-glycoprotein at both mRNA and protein levels in vivo (Chen et al. 2015). Anyhow, safety and efficacy data should be established, especially via a toxicity study prior to evaluation in a human study. Tetrandrine (30 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) also ameliorated sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment by suppression of inflammation and apoptosis in aged rats. Thus, tetrandrine may potentially be a novel candidate to protect cognitive function against the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia (Ma et al. 2016). A limitation of this study was the single dose of tetrandrine used and not a positive control. Tetrandrine (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) was also shown to reduce cognitive impairment in chronic cerebral hypo-perfused rats by inhibition of the activation of S100B and a decrease in the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS in the hippocampal CA1 region (Chen et al. 2013). The limitations of this study were the single dose of tetrandrine used and the lack of a positive control.",

The positive control ketanserin at the doses of 0.0625, 0.25 and 1 mg/kg (administered intraperitoneally) also showed similar effects (Indra et al. 2002). Although nantenine had a similar effect with ketanserin, the doses of nantenine used were significantly larger than that of ketanserin. Additionally, nantenine (20\u201350 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) presented anticonvulsant effect in inhibiting pentylenotetrazol and maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rats, whereas nantenine at higher doses (75\u2013105 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) has been shown to a convulsant activity appears to be related to inhibition of phosphatase at high doses and cause a decrease in Ca2+-influx into cells at low doses (Ribeiro and Leite 2003). Unfortunately, the authors of this study did not perform comparisons using a positive control. Magnoflorine (49) (20 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) alone enhanced cognition, and co-administration of magnoflorine with scopolamine blocked long-term, but not short-term, memory impairment (Kukula-Koch et al. 2017). However, no explanation of the active principle or mechanisms of action was provided and use of a positive control was lacking. Stepholidine (57) (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) is a natural dopamine (D) receptor D1 agonist and D2 antagonist. It can significantly reduce cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly decreased break points for cocaine reward (Manuszak et al. 2018). It is a pity that this trial lacked a positive control. The in vivo effects of stepholidine are largely mediated through blockade of the dopamine receptor with potential cross-talk to other receptors or signaling proteins (Meade et al. 2015). Stepholidine (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) has been shown to dose-dependently attenuate reinstatement of a desire to seek 3, 4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone following priming by a cue plus 3, 4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone in an intravenous self-administration model (Hicks et al. 2018). Anyhow, it is important that an experimental animal model is also established to further verify the effects of stepholidine in vivo.",

In anesthetized rats, extracts of S. tetrandra (50 or 150 mg/kg/day, administered orally) reduced both frequency of arrhythmias and size of infarcts induced by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. These effects were comparable to those of tetrandrine (50 mg/kg/day) and verapamil (Yu et al. 2004). In this study, phytochemical analysis of extracts of S. tetrandra was not evaluated. Moreover, only two doses of extracts of S. tetrandra were used throughout this study, limiting any data on dose-dependency. Intragastric administration of tetrandrine (9) (30 and 60 mg/kg/day) significantly lowered the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats by inhibition of the noradrenergic system, rather than by calcium channel blockade. The effects of tetrandrine at the dose of 60 mg/kg/day were similar to those treated with amlodipine (a positive control, 100 mg/kg/day) after one day. After treated with drugs on two and three days, the effects of tetrandrine (30 and 60 mg/kg/day) were weaker than those of amlodipine (100 mg/kg/day) (Huang et al. 2016). Nonetheless, only two doses of tetrandrine were used throughout this study, limiting any data on dose-dependency, as well as the trial lacked a positive control and toxicity assessment. A similar study also reported that intragastric administration of tetrandrine (100 mg/kg, administered orally) significantly lowered the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats over three days of treatment (Zhang et al. 2014). However, this investigation was also conducted without the use of a positive control and lacked any analysis of a dose-dependent relationship. And the dose of tetrandrine was used too high to provide reliable experimental data for clinical application. Tetrandrine (80 mg/kg/day, administered intraperitoneally) was shown to prevent monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats by regulation of protein expression in inducible NOS and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase type 1. Compared with vardenafil (2.0 mg/kg/day, administered intraperitoneally), tetrandrine (80 mg/kg/day) exhibited similar effects against monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats (Wang et al. 2016c). The flaws of the study lie in only a single dose of tetrandrine used throughout the study, limiting analysis of dose-dependency. Finally, tetrandrine substantially lowered intraocular pressure in a rat model of ocular hypertension, although no explanation of the active principle or mechanism of action was offered. More importantly, this study did not state the unit of tetrandrine dose, it was just indicated that 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% tetrandrine were administered in this study (Huang et al. 2011). Tetrandrine (2.0\u201320 mg/kg, administered intravenously) has been shown to lower portal venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance in cirrhotic rats (Huang et al. 1999). It is worth noting that this study also did not include a positive control or investigate the mechanism of action.",

Anyhow, the mechanism by which this activity occurred should be investigated further. Oral administration of dicentrine (5 and 8 mg/kg) to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats induced hypotension that lasted for more than 15 h. Additionally, administration of dicentrine (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) and prazosin (0.01, 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg) intravenously induced a dose-related reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) which reached a maximal effect 5\u201310 min after injection and persisted for 2 h. This suggests that dicentrine may have therapeutic potential as an oral or intravenous antihypertensive drug by acting as a blockade of the \u03b1-adrenoceptor (Yu et al. 1992a). Nonetheles, future studies should attempt to identify the mechanism of action and toxicity of dicentrine. These results reinforce the traditional uses of S. tetrandra as an antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic treatment.",

In these studies, phytochemical analysis of S. tetrandra extracts was not investigated. Moreover, only a single dose of S. tetrandra extract and tetrandrine were used throughout the studies, and thus limited the information on the dose-dependent effect. Tetrandrine (9) not only acts as an antihypertensive drug, it (50 mg/kg, administered orally) also reverses cardiac and vascular remodeling. The latter occurs through inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, through the inhibition of induction and sensitization of vascular smooth muscle cells to stimulate pro-apoptosis and by improving endothelial function (Rao 2002). Nevertheless, these results did not display a dose-dependent relationship and some investigations lacked positive controls. Renovascular hypertensive rats demonstrated hypertrophy and altered remodeling of the artery and arteriole walls in addition to the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in renal arterioles. This vascular remodeling was shown to be suppressed by tetrandrine (50 mg/kg, administered orally), markedly attenuating these changes (Li et al. 2003), and inhibiting collagen synthesis and deposition in their arteries (Li et al. 2001). However, these studies had important limitations\u2014only one dose of tetrandrine was used and thus no information about dose-dependency was investigated, as well as no appropriate positive controls were used. Tetrandrine (10, 20 or 40 \u03bcM) has been shown to antagonize angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by decreasing angiotensin II-induced elevation of pulse rate, cell size, total protein content and rate of protein synthesis. It also inhibited the activity and expression of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2) (Zhou et al. 2007). Unfortunately, the authors of this study did not perform comparisons using a positive control. Furthermore, tetrandrine (15 mg/kg) offered full protection against myocardial infarction that was experimentally induced by non-invasive treatment with isoproterenol in rabbits (Pinelli et al. 2010). The major limitation of this study was the lack of analysis of a dose-dependent relationship. Tetrandrine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) has also been shown to ameliorate ischemic-reperfusion injury in rat myocardium by inhibition of neutrophil priming and activation (Shen et al. 1999). Nevertheless, only two doses of tetrandrine were used in these studies, and thus information regarding the dose-dependent effect is limited.",

Dicentrine has the potential to reduce two major cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It does this via a decrease in mean arterial pressure and reduced vascular hyperreactivity to phenylephrine. Dicentrine (5 and 10 mg/kg, administered orally) also lowers blood concentrations of cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol while increasing concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Yu et al. 1993). These experiments had a number of shortcomings, including the absence of a positive control and only two doses of drug, resulting in the lack of reliability of results and absence of analysis of a dose-dependent effect. In anesthetized normotensive rats, acute intravenous administration of nantenine (44) (3\u20135 mg/kg, administered intravenously) produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure, accompanied by a significant decrease in heart rate (Orallo 2004).

Rheumatoid arthritis patients were administered 10 g extract of S. tetrandra orally for 12 weeks in a clinical trial. The clinical trial results showed that extract of S. tetrandra could significantly reduce the lipid peroxide level, the plasma human granulocyte elastase level, granulocyte count and proportion of granulocytes in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients, and increase leukocyte/elastase ratio and granulocyte/elastase ratio (Sekiya et al. 2004). The limitations of this study were the lack of description of doses and a positive control. Tetrandrine at 0.1\u2013100 \u03bcM inhibited neutrophil-monocyte chemotactic factor-1 upregulation and adhesion to fibrinogen induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and reduced production of oxygen free radical, down-regulated synthesis and release of some proinflammatory cytokines (Semwal et al. 2010). In an in vitro study, tetrandrine at 16.0 \u03bcM had potent immunosuppressive activity by suppressing the antibody synthesis by B cells, and the mitogen-induced lymphoproliferative response (Seow et al. 1988). Nonetheless, the same shortages of this study as most of the aforementioned literature are lack of positive control and a single dose was used. The underlying mechanisms for these immunomodulatory effects have been studied extensively. These compounds inhibited activation of human peripheral blood T-cells by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) + cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28)-costimulation and CD3 + CD28-costimulation (Lai et al. 1999). They have also been shown to reverse the pathological process of collagen-induced arthritis by modulating metabolic pathway imbalances (Yun et al. 2018), markedly alleviating the severity of arthritis and reducing serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The compounds further restored the ratio of T helper 17 (Th17)/ regulatory T (Treg) cells. This has been demonstrated by measurement of serum concentrations of relevant cytokines (IL-17 and IL-10) and the proportion of each cell type (Yuan et al. 2016). They have also reduced expression of Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), and inhibited Akt and JNK activation, resulting in the subsequent down-regulation of MMP-2/9, F-actin and FAK activation and/or expression (Lv et al. 2015). They have also been shown to reduce the concentrations of ROS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, prostaglandin-E2 and matrix metalloproteinases (Shan et al. 2018), and inhibit the secretion of IL-1\u03b1, TXB (2), ET-1 and E-selectin in LPS-induced endothelial cells (Hu et al. 2012).",

Although there are numerous studies of the immunomodulatory effects of tetrandrine and fangchinoline, future studies should attempt to replicate these immunomodulatory effects with appropriate postive controls, and under clinical conditions with low doses suitable for human administration. Neuromyelitis optica is a severe neurological demyelinating autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerves and the spinal cord. Isotetrandrine (27) at 100 \u03bcM has been shown to reduce astrocyte cytotoxicity in neuromyelitis optica by blocking the binding of neuromyelitis optica-immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) to aquaporin 4 (Sun et al. 2016). However, the authors of this study did not perform comparisons using a positive control, as well as conducted only one too high concentration.",

Tetrandrine (9) modulates TNF and collagen gene expression and could be used to treat silicosis alone or in combination with other therapies (Idec-Sadkowska et al. 2006; Liu et al. 1994; Xv and Zhou 2015; Chen et al. 2018; Resit et al. 1993; Castranova et al. 1991). Tetrandrine (50 mg/kg, administered orally) was shown to inhibit the development of experimental silicosis of rats by reducing \u03b11 (I) and \u03b11(III) collagen mRNA levels of silicotic rat lung, but this study was conducted without the use of positive control, and also lacks analysis of dose-effects relationship of tetrandrine (Idec-Sadkowska et al. 2006; Liu et al. 1994). In a clinical trial, silicosis patients were administered 40 mg tetrandrine orally at three times a day for 6 month. The results of this trial showed that tetrandrine could significantly relieve the clinical symptoms and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis in the treatment of silicosis patients compared with the control group (Xv and Zhou 2015). In another clinical trial, tetrandrine (100 mg, administered orally) combined with ursolic acid was significantly superior to the simple medicine group (only tetrandrine group or only ursolic acid group) (Chen et al. 2018). Nevertheless, these clinical trials have the same shortages of no positive control and absence of dose-effects relationship. Moreover, these studies lacked the safety evaluation of tetrandrine on silicosis patients. The mechanisms governing the antifibrotic action of tetrandrine (2\u201310 \u03bcM) were shown to be inhibit the ability of fibroblasts to respond to stimulation by growth factors, such as platelet derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor (Resit et al. 1993). Additionally, tetrandrine (96 \u03bcM) could inhibit particle-stimulated oxygen consumption, superoxide release, and hydrogen peroxide secretion by alveolar macrophages, and also exhibited substantial binding affinity for membrane lipids and alveolar macrophages (Castranova et al. 1991). Although tetrandrine has been approved in China for the treatment of silicosis, the antifibrotic effects, mechanisms of other alkaloids in S. tetrandra, and toxicity of these alkaloids require further investigation.",

However, this study lacked use of a positive control. Tetrandrine (8.0 \u03bcM) also exerted an antifibrotic effect on human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts by inducing the expression of microRNA, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), SMAD family member 2 (Smad2) and SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) (Ning et al. 2016). Tetrandrine (4.0\u201320.0 \u03bcM) could inhibit human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts at least partially through induction of Smad7 and decrement of Smad2 resulting in inhibition of TGF-b1 transcription and its intracellular signaling, which led to reduction of type I and III collagen production and suppression of cell reproductive activity (Li et al. 2012). Nevertheless, the mechanism of the antifibrotic effect on human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts in vivo requires further study. Additionally, tetrandrine (5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/kg/day) exhibited a synergistic effect when used with prednisone (10 mg/kg/day) for renal fibrosis caused by adriamycin in rats. This was mediated by inhibition of fibrotropic factors and expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mediated by the promotion of anti-fibrosis factor MMP13 expression (Bai and Dong 2016). We believe that safety and efficacy data should be established next especially via toxicity study prior to entering the human study.",

Nonetheless, only two doses of tetrandrine were used in this study and thus a full analysis of dose-dependent effects was not possible. Tetrandrine (1 mg/kg, administered intravenously) also activated nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla that enhanced the secretion of \u03b2-endorphin, and it stimulated opioid \u03bc-receptors that increased glucose utilization and/or reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, lowering plasma glucose concentrations in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Hsu et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2004). A study design with only one dose of drug and an absence of a positive control were definite shortcomings in these studies. Fangchinoline (10) (0.3\u20133 mg/kg) decreased high blood glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner and also increased low blood insulin concentrations in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (Ma et al. 2007; Tsutsumi et al. 2003). It is unfortunate that these trials lacked proper positive controls, compromising the quality of the studies. Furthermore, fangchinoline (3.0 mg/kg) protected against nephron damage by attenuating changes in the p38 MAPK pathway that reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in rats with diabetic nephropathy (Jiang et al. 2018). Nonetheless, only a single dose of fangchinoline was used in the study, limiting the data on a dose response. Cepharanthine (25) (10 mg/kg/day, administered intraperitoneally) was shown to decrease blood and serum concentrations of glucose, urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde and creatinine. It also reduced proteinuria and the kidney to body weight ratio by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 (Samra et al. 2016). Nevertheless, this investigation was conducted without the use of a positive control and also lacked analysis of the relationship with dose. Treatment with fangchinoline (10) (0.3\u20133.0 mg/kg), fangchinoline 2\u2032-N-\u03b1-oxide (18) (1.0 mg/kg) and 2\u2032-N-norfangchinoline (19) (1.0 mg/kg) reduced elevated blood glucose concentrations to almost half of their initial concentration. In addition, tetrandrine 2\u2032-N-\u03b2-oxide (15) (1.0 mg/kg), tetrandrine 2\u2032-N-\u03b1-oxide (16) (1.0 mg/kg), tetrandrine 2-N-\u03b2-oxide (17) (1.0 mg/kg) and fangchinoline 2\u2032-N-\u03b1-oxide (18) (1.0 mg/kg) also decreased hyperglycemic blood concentrations by ~ 50% (Tsutsumi et al. 2003). However, this study lacked appropriate positive controls, compromising the quality of data. Furthermore, the relationship between the structure of those compounds and anti-hyperglycemic effects has not been investigated. Though various constituents in S. tetrandra have been evaluated for their anti-hyperglycemic activity, further research is required to verify the effectiveness of the constituents, the mechanisms involved and effective doses. Also, further investigation in both in vivo and in vitro models is required.",

Flaws in the studies lie in the lack of a positive control. N-methylcoclaurine (1) at 334.4 \u03bcM and coclaurine (3) at 350.8 \u03bcM have shown strong inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation (Chen et al. 1996). Yet this investigation was also conducted without the use of a positive control and also lacked analysis of a dose\u2013effect relationship of the two compounds. Moreover, no discussion of the principle of their activity or mechanism of action in vivo was provided, and the concentrations of N-methylcoclaurine and coclaurine used were too high to provide reliable experimental data for clinical application. Dicentrine (39) (30\u2013150 \u03bcM) can inhibit thromboxane formation and increase cyclic AMP concentrations in rabbit platelets. Thus, it offers therapeutic potential as an antiplatelet agent (Yu et al. 1992b). Although the study reported on the effects of dicentrine on antiplatelet effects in vitro, they are insufficiently detailed. An experimental animal model should also be established to further verify the antiplatelet effects of dicentrine.",

It acts primarily by preventing outer hair cell damage and preventing synapse loss between inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (Yu et al. 2018). Despite the dramatic effects of tetrandrine in protection against noise-induced hearing loss at the cellular level, molecular mechanisms underlying this protection are not well understood. Tetrandrine at 10 \u03bcM had strong anti-adipogenic effects on 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. These effects are possibly largely attributed to a reduction in the expression and/or phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), fatty acid synthase (FAS), perilipin A and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) (Jang 2016).

We believe that further work will be required to clarify that tetrandrine acts on the expression and/or function of transcription factors which form complexes with the nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in osteoclasts. Tetrandrine (10, 30 or 100 \u03bcM) was demonstrated to relax corpus cavernosum tissues in rabbits. This was attributed to the inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ influx and suppression of intracellular-stored Ca2+ release, but it was not mediated by NO, prostaglandin release or potassium channel activation (Chen et al. 2009b). However, further experiments are required to establish whether the cAMP or Rho-A/Rhokinase pathways contribute to tetrandrine-induced relaxation. Tetrandrine at the concentration of 3.2 \u03bcM has radioprotective effects against 10 Gy of ionizing irradiation and it was able to suppress irradiation-induced inflammatory processes (Chen et al. 1997). However, this study had some shortcomings, including lack of a positive control and exploration of only a single dose of drug, resulting in lower reliability of data and absence of any investigation of a dose\u2013response effect.",

In rat phaeochromocytoma PC 12 cells, 100 \u03bcM tetrandrine abolished high K+ (30 mM)-induced sustained increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, inhibited bombesin-induced inositol triphosphate accumulation in NIH/3T3 fibroblast and abolished Ca2+ entry (Takemura et al. 1996). The shortage of this study was that the dose of tetrandrine was too high and only one dose was used. Tetrandrine (3\u2013100 \u03bcM) concentration and time dependently inhibited the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient without any significant effect on the resting level of [Ca2+]i in the isolated single rat cardiomyocyte (Wang et al. 1997). Tetrandrine (10\u201330 \u03bcM) significantly inhibited the increase of [Ca2+]i in induced by glutamate, serotonin and histamine in dissociated retina cells (Xuan et al. 2009). 30 \u03bcM tetrandrine inhibited NO production by the endothelial cells through blockade of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (Kwan et al. 2001). Tetrandrine inhibited Ca2+-activated chloride channel in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells with an IC50 of 5.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM (Fang et al. 2004). Fangchinoline (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM), a nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker, mitigated the harmful effects of cyanide-induced neuronal cell death by interfering with [Ca2+]i influx by inhibiting glutam ate release and oxidants generation(Cho and Seong 2002). Some experimental animal models must be established to further verify these effects in vivo.",

Of these compounds, N-methylcoclaurine exhibited an inhibitory effect similar to that of fangchinoline (Nakamura et al. 1992). However, this study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds by inhibition of histamine release only, their mechanisms of action requiring additional investigation.

Magnoflorine (49) at 53.5 \u03bcM in combination with hyaluronic acid gel promoted subchondral bone regeneration. It also exhibited a protective effect by stimulating the recovery of subchondral bone integrity and attenuating cartilage degradation, preventing the progression of osteoarthritis (Cai et al. 2018). However, this study evaluated the potential benefits of hyaluronic acid-gel combined with magnoflorine in promoting subchondral bone regeneration and the protective effects of stimulating recovery of subchondral bone integrity on attenuating cartilage degradation.

Magnoflorine (0\u201310 \u03bcM) was also found to inhibit copper-mediated oxidation of low and high density lipoproteins.

The time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 14.00 \u00b1 10.02 h with a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 67.26 \u00b1 23.22 \u03bcg/L.

In a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model, there was no statistical difference between males and females in tetrandrine plasma concentrations at identical time points, indicating that no sex differences existed in the pharmacokinetics of tetrandrine in SD rats.

The time to peak concentration occurred after approximately 6 h in the liver, the principle site of corydalamine metabolism by hepatic microsomes. These data indicate that corydalmine was absorbed after oral administration and then distributed quickly in SD rats in vivo. Furthermore, high concentrations in the brain and spinal cord may be related to the pharmacological activity of this compound in the central nervous system (Zhang et al. 2018c). Metabolism of L-corydalmine was evaluated in vitro in liver microsomes from five species: mice, rats, monkeys, dogs and humans.

This may be due to its biotransformation to a quinone methide-derived metabolite mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes (Tian et al. 2016b). Tetrandrine has the potential for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity (Rosenkranz and Klopman 1990; Whong et al. 1989; Xing et al. 1989). After intravenous administration of a single dose of 150 mg/kg tetrandrine to mice, tetrandrine induced transient toxicity to the liver, lungs and kidneys. Withdrawal of tetrandrine was associated with reversal of these pathological changes (Shi et al. 2016b). Although no nephrotoxicity caused by aristolochic acids has been reported in S. tetrandra, it may have the potential to cause nephrotoxicity. After S. tetrandra was chronically administered to SD male rats for more than 4 weeks, it damaged tubulointerstitial tissue and damaged the structure of glomeruli (Sun and Wu 2012; Cai et al. 2005). However, as described above, tetrandrine used in combination with prednisone caused a synergistic effect on renal fibrosis caused by adriamycin in rats (Bai and Dong 2016). Therefore, a safe and effective dose of tetrandrine still requires evaluation.",

The research achievements and gaps were discussed. Although there have been some achievements in the traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of S. tetrandra, there are still some scientific gaps. Theses scientific gaps are as follows: (1) the plant origin of \u201cFang Ji\u201d and the strating time of traditional uses of S. tetrandra is needed to further investigation. (2) Lack of phytochemistry studies on the aerial part of S. tetrandra. (3) Anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects are the most studied in the wide range of pharmacological properties of S. tetrandra. However, other pharmacological properties need to further in-depth investigated S. tetrandra. (4) Toxicological studies on S. tetrandra are limited. To date, only tetrandrine from S. tetrandra has been identified as causing potential toxicity to the liver, lungs, genes and kidneys. Due to a lack of data assessing other alkaloids, their toxicity requires further evaluation. (5) There are many alkaloids that have only been tentatively identified by mass spectrometry. Their precise structures need to be determined by an in-depth exploration using nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), circular dichroism (CD) and mass spectrometry (MS). (6) Alkaloids are traditionally considered the major bioactive compounds in S. tetrandra, which leads to the result that other constituents of S. tetrandra such as bisflavone have not yet been investigated. It severely limited the diversity of research and applications of S. tetrandra. (7) Analyses of the structure\u2013activity relationships of these alkaloids are insufficient. (8) In vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies have increasingly confirmed the traditional use of S. tetrandra as an analgesic, antiphlogistic and immunoregulatory medicine for arthralgia caused by rheumatism and inflamed sores. However, it\u2019s antinociceptive and immunomodulatory effects have been insufficiently studied. (9) Studies on the pharmacology, especially anti-tumor effects, have critical limitations, with insufficient numbers, replications and a lack of in-depth or systematic study at the molecular and cellular levels. (10) S. tetrandra has been shown to possess a number of distinct pharmacological activities at both the cellular level and that of the whole organism. However, the mechanisms of action of component molecules are poorly described and require further investigation.",
