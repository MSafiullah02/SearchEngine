X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19. Conclusion The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.",

The development of the disease, its transmission, and the increased mortality in a number of countries, make it imperative to develop treatment, but also to protect health care and society from the transmission of the disease. Therefore, remote control of the disease, including diagnosis, early quarantine, and follow-up, is essential. Artificial intelligence can contribute to the above perspectives. Recent studies claim to achieve precise results regarding the automatic detection of the disease from thoracic X-ray scans [1] [2] [3] .

The first issue is related to the methodology of the experimental setups. In essence, the researches have demonstrated that the detection of COVID-19 is achievable, but this conclusion derives from an analysis based on incomplete data. \u03a4he models proposed are powerful in classifying images between only three classes (viral and bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, normal). This, unfortunately, does not demonstrate the existence of a clear fingerprint of the Coronavirus in X-ray images, firstly, due to the insignificant database size and, secondly, due to the fact that the fingerprints of other pulmonary diseases have not been compared. The second issue is related to the flaws of Deep Learning and is often referred to as the issue of interpretability [6] . In short, the algorithm is not transparent, thereby a radiologist cannot supervise and know which factors or indices were utilized by the model to reach to a decision.",

The off-the-self strategy is an approach utilizing the weights of the Convolutional layers, which are defined from the source task (the initial training of another domain) without re-training the network [14] .

Usually, the Fine-Tuning strategy allows more trainable weights at the top of the network (i.e., the final steps), due to the fact that those convolutional layers extract more abstract and high-level information, compared to the first layers wherein local features are learned. In the particular experiment, we gradually allow more layers to be trainable, by defining six experimental cases, referred to as Fine-Tuning (e.g., 11), where the number in the parenthesis corresponds to the number of trainable convolutional blocks.",

With Deep Learning, it is possible to extract millions of related features. The extracted features' importance to the specific task is questionable. The majority of those features may be irrelevant to the desired outcome, or the desired subject of study and are rejected by the automatic classification performed after the convolutional layers of a CNN. The biomarkers are quantitative markers of confirmed significance and are not limited to the image features [23] . Generally, the ability of Deep Learning for image biomarker extraction is questionable due to the issue of the interpretability. This study suggests that it may be possible to discover new reliable biomarkers from X-ray images due to the fact that a high classification accuracy was achieved. Since the CNNs and the Neural Networks lay on the evaluation of millions of parameters to classify the significant features, some of those features may actually be image biomarkers leading to a reliable result. This horizon in to be investigated in future research, possibly exploring other approaches, such as Radiomics [24] .",

In particular, it is demonstrated that those strategies do not mine the same features. This can be easily interpreted, since with strategies of Transfer Learning with of-the-self-features and Transfer Learning with fine-tuning, the ability of the CNN to extract significant features depends on factors related to the initial training. The initial training was mandatory to be performed on images of a completely different nature due to the absence of large-scale data. However, despite the fact that the latter strategies have excellent performances in other medical image classification tasks [12, 25] , in the particular experiment, they were underperforming. This may suggest that with the training from scratch, essential features related to the pulmonary abnormalities have been mined, which may constitute relevant Biomarkers.",

The three training strategies were employed to evaluate the significance of the extracted features of each strategy. The strategy of allowing the deep CNN to learn new characteristics and features from the specific images resulted in an excellent performance over the other approaches, wherein features are extracted based on mined knowledge from non-medical images, or images unrelated to pulmonary diseases.
