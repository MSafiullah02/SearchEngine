Pretransplant recipient screening also helps determine immunity to vaccine\u2010preventable illnesses and may help with allocation of infected donor organs to recipients with known immunity to certain pathogens 6. The pretransplant period is an ideal time for detailed counseling of the recipient and his/her family about safe food handling and the risk of infection associated with pets, travel and hobbies such as gardening and woodworking. Infection prevention approaches including hand hygiene, prophylactic antimicrobials, postexposure prophylaxis and updating of immunizations should be addressed as well.",

Clinical reassessment of the prospective living donor is indicated if clinical signs or symptoms of possible infection occur, particularly any unexplained febrile illness between the time of initial screening and the planned date of transplantation. The CDC has recommended that all living donors be rescreened with HIV serology and HIV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) prior to organ donation, to look for evidence of recently acquired infection 29.

Serologic workup is performed in laboratories associated with organ procurement organizations or similar screening agencies (hereafter referred to as OPOs) which operate on a 24\u2010h basis to generate the data needed to determine donor suitability. Because of time constraints and the extensive geographic areas covered by some OPOs, testing is often limited to serologic methods that are rapid and routinely available. Because more sensitive testing may not be available, some infections, such as HIV and HCV, may be difficult to diagnose at an early stage, before the development of specific antibody 23, 24, 25, 30. Thus, a comprehensive social and medical history on the donor is required to identify risk for infections that might not be detected by serologic testing. Furthermore, certain infections may come to light only after the transplant has been performed, when results of routine procurement cultures of blood, urine and sputum become available. Increasingly, some OPOs are utilizing rapid molecular testing, particularly in high\u2010risk potential donors, including NAT testing for HCV, HBV and HIV. A recent consensus conference on the utility of routine NAT testing was, however, inconclusive, largely due to concerns that testing is not feasible within the deceased donor timeframe in some areas, as well as concern that false positive test results in potential donors with no identified risk factors for infection might result in wastage of viable organs 30. Testing for certain pathogens with particular geographic significance such as Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas\u2019 disease), endemic mycoses and West Nile virus may be performed by some OPOs. If a deceased donor with uncertain risk is to be used, informed consent of the recipient should include the risk for infection transmission.",

This may represent either a false\u2010positive test (if isolated HBcAb positive) or the presence of chronic HBV infection. In the latter, there is a significant risk of transmission of HBV to a liver transplant recipient, and therefore these livers were often not utilized in the past (II\u20102); however, it has now become more common to transplant livers from HBcAb positive donors utilizing intensive posttransplant prophylaxis 68. The risk for transmission to extrahepatic recipients appears to be low, but has occurred 68, 70, 71, 72; this risk can be decreased by pretransplant HBV vaccination of the recipient. Some centers restrict the use of organs from the core\u2010positive donor to life\u2010threatening situations and/or vaccinated recipients, or would utilize posttransplant prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or lamivudine if transplanted into a nonimmune recipient (II\u20103) 12, 13, 72. Because of the possibility of being offered such an organ, it is prudent to vaccinate all seronegative transplant candidates with HBV vaccine, although the response to this vaccine in patients with end\u2010stage organ disease may be suboptimal, requiring higher doses and repeated injections to attain immunity (III).

Extensive education of the transplant recipient and his or her family is a very important preventive tool. Pretransplant classes and printed materials are helpful and should include information on handwashing/hand hygiene, environmental exposures, activities to avoid, food safety and handling, foodborne pathogens, pets and travel. It is also helpful for patients to have a general idea of the infections to which transplant patients are susceptible and the preventive strategies in use at their particular center. It is fundamental that patients know what to expect, what can go wrong and what is expected of them.",
