The majority of patients have symptoms of fever [3], and accordingly we can conduct preliminary screening of surgical patients. Patients with positive epidemic history or fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms should be guided to the fever center for treatment. For patients without the above conditions, we re-examined them through routine preoperative examinations, including blood routine, chest CT and respiratory function tests. However, owing to the lack of understanding of COVID-19, we are not sure whether asymptomatic virus carriers were admitted to hospital for planned surgery. Therefore, all the hospitalized patients should be arranged in line with the strategy of single person and single room.",

For suspected or confirmed patients during the operation, the operation can only be performed in the negative pressure operating room. To further reduce the possibility of infection, the types of items in the operating room should be reduced, disposable items should be used as much as possible, and surgical personnel should be streamlined. During the operation, in addition to protecting from blood and secretions, attention should also be paid to the smoke and aerosols produced by electrosurgical equipment. In reality, surgical masks were absolutely ineffective in protecting individuals from the toxic smoke [4]. Aerosols can be suspended in the air for a long time and then invade the human body through the respiratory tract. Oral and maxillofacial surgery generally involves the upper respiratory tract, and the surgical site is often contaminated by saliva, so when the electrosurgical equipment is used, powerful suction should be applied to reduce the diffusion of surgical smoke and aerosols. Also, it is recommended that ultrasonic scalpel should be given priority to reduce surgical smoke in those operations that can be performed with ultrasonic scalpel [5]. After completion of the operation, the anesthetic machine and the operating room need to be thoroughly disinfected before the next operation can be carried out.",

However, incidences of pulmonary complications after tracheotomy were reported to be 15% to 46%. If the patients with pulmonary infection after tracheotomy were unfortunately infected with the novel coronavirus, the consequences would be even worse. Moreover, for novel coronavirus-infected patients including asymptomatic virus carriers, the virus can spread through splashing of respiratory secretions when the patients cough. Therefore, health workers should still wear masks, goggles, protective clothing and disposable gloves when treating the ordinary patients, while the protection of treating patients receiving a tracheotomy should be more stringent, such as upgrading general surgical masks to N95 masks as list in Table 1\n.",
