Not long after he first raised awareness for SARS-CoV-2, he was infected by a presymptomatic patient with glaucoma and died. 1 Just a few months after Dr Wenliang's death, several studies have confirmed both presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 2-5 and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr Robert Redfield estimates that as many as 25% of individuals who test positive for COVID-19 disease are asymptomatic. 6 Hence, the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during an ophthalmology office visit is well warranted and requires ophthalmologists, optometrists, and ancillary personnel to be aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19; and to minimize transmission to personnel and other patients.",

A study of 30 patients in China found that 1 patient with conjunctivitis had SARS-CoV-2 in tear film and conjunctival discharge, suggesting that the virus may cause infection through the conjunctiva or ocular surfaces. 7 In a study of 38 patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, ocular findings such as conjunctival hyperemia and epiphora were associated with more severe clinical disease, higher white blood cell, and neutrophil counts, and greater C-reactive protein elevation compared with patients without ocular symptoms. 8 Though the risk of ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the tear film is likely low, 9 the use of ophthalmic diagnostic equipment and procedures that requires close proximity to patients-such as the slit lamp, ophthalmoscope, and ocular manipulation-increases the risk of viral transmission from patient to physician through respiratory droplets and contact with surfaces. In addition, several ophthalmic instruments are commonly used during a single-patient visit and, if not disinfected properly, these tools can become potential sources of transmission.",

Moreover, patients visiting a glaucoma clinic are often older adults with comorbidities, 12,13 the demographic at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19. 14 How can glaucoma specialists adjust their practice to best protect themselves from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and avoid becoming a vector for transmission to patients and staff? Through an internet search and communication with ophthalmic equipment manufacturers, we have compiled recommendations for hygiene and disinfection in outpatient glaucoma clinics as a reference guide. The Ophthalmology Department at Columbia University implemented many of these practices before the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) or the CDCpublished guidelines for outpatient care. Following the development of an operational task force at Columbia University, the Ophthalmology Department shared several commonsense measures for practice operations starting March 2. The department has continued to be proactive in adjusting best practices for ophthalmology clinics, and these updated protocols and policies, including a Patient Visit Stratification, are publicly available on the department's COVID-19 Information webpage. 15 ",

[17] [18] [19] [20] The CDC has published guidelines for health care facilities to protect patients and staff during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. 21 These recommendations include screening patients for symptoms of acute respiratory illness -including cough or shortness of breath, sore throat, or systemic symptoms like myalgias or chills-and advising patients to check their temperature before their arrival at the health care facility, asking all patients about history of travel to areas with high prevalence of COVID-19 or contact with possible COVID-19 positive individuals, separating patients with respiratory symptoms from other patients in the waiting area, optimizing the use of telemedicine, limiting the number of staff providing care, installing barriers to limit contact with patients during triage, and emphasizing hand hygiene for patients and staff. 22, 23 On March 18, 2020, the AAO published \"New Recommendations for Urgent and Nonurgent Patient Care,\" 24 urging ophthalmologists to halt providing any treatment that is nonurgent or nonemergent. The AAO is continually updating their guidelines for practice management specific to ophthalmology.

Aspects of the equipment that come into direct contact with the patient include the forehead and chin rests, the patient response button, the chair, and the eye occluder. The corrective lens may also come into contact with the patient's eyelashes or nose. Respiratory droplets may accumulate on these surfaces and importantly within the perimetry bowl itself. The duration of viral particle presence on the bowl surface, how long the particles remain suspended within the bowl, and whether the viral particles can be dislodged or resuspended by normal breathing or talking by the patient undergoing testing is unknown. The eye occluder may be replaced with disposable material such as taped gauze or an amblyopia patch to decrease the amount of time and material used for disinfection between each patient. Disinfection of visual field analyzers including the bowl surface may be difficult, and the AAO previously suggested avoiding the use of \"equipment that cannot be safely disinfected, such as some visual field analyzers.\" 24 Routine perimetry should therefore be performed judiciously and taking into account the aforementioned precautions.

One potential benefit, for instance, is that these tonometers permit more staff-patient distancing than other methods.
