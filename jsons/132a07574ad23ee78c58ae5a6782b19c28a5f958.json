Upon entry into the abdomen, the patient was found to have necrotic bowel extending from the ligament of Treitz to the transverse colon with a perforation of the terminal ileum (Fig. 2) . The necrosis had unique characteristics, including a bright yellow discoloration (rather than black or purple ischemic changes), distribution that varied between circumferential involvement and patchy involvement along the antimesenteric side of the small bowel, and clear demarcation of the borders of ischemia without anatomic transition zones (Fig. 3) . The yellow necrotic areas were found to be extremely thin and friable. Given the extent of involvement and the patient's critically ill status, the injury was deemed to be unsurvivable. The abdomen was closed and the patient passed away in the ICU shortly after transitioning to comfort measures only. The family declined an autopsy.",

Given the patent mesenteric vasculature and antimesenteric pattern of necrosis, it is hypothesized that this phenomenon may occur as a result of microvascular thrombosis and associated inflammation in these patients with known hypercoagulability. The potential for direct tissue injury from Fig. 1 CT scan demonstrating evidence of small bowel ischemia with perforation SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gastrointestinal tract has not been extensively studied and may also provide insight as to the underlying mechanism of ischemia.
