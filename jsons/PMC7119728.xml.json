This has resulted in discovery of new, previously unknown viruses that are often uncultivable (Victoria et al., 2008, Li et al., 2009, Phan et al., 2012, Reuter et al., 2012). These technologies have allowed screening of samples collected from domestic animals (Shan et al., 2011, Phan et al., 2011, Reuter et al., 2012) and from animals in the wild to determine if they are carriers of potentially zoonotic viral pathogens (Donaldson et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Phan et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2012). Additionally, deep sequence analysis was applied to screening of commercially available vaccines for the presence of contaminants and variants (Victoria et al., 2010).",

These include methodologies based on PCR amplification of viral sequences, both in fragments (Rao et al., 2013) or full-length genome amplification (Christenbury et al., 2010). These have primarily focused on specific, closely related viruses. The Sequence-Independent, Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) procedure was first used to amplify DNA populations through the use of random priming and ligation of adaptors for PCR amplification (Reyes and Kim, 1991). This was modified for amplification of viral sequences from serum to include a step where DNase I was used to first degrade host DNA (Allander et al., 2001). This protocol has since been used in the identification of a novel pestivirus (Kirkland et al., 2007), bocaviruses (Cheng et al., 2010) and identification of viruses associated with cytopathic effect in cell cultures of unknown origin (Abed and Boivin, 2009).",

Often these isolates have clinical histories associated with them that detail where and when the isolations were made and descriptions of the disease state of the host. There is a wealth of information in these isolates, but up till now, it has been time consuming and expensive to sequence these viral genomes, often requiring sets of strain-specific primers for PCR amplification and sequencing. The protocol outlined in this study provides the means to rapidly sequence archival collections of viruses to study the evolution of specific viruses over time.

The two virus groups sequenced were 21 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolates and 19 bovine coronavirus (BoCV) isolates. After isolation/propagation of the viruses on appropriate host cells, the medium was frozen/thawed twice, cell debris removed by centrifugation, and aliquots frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Routinely, the libraries were constructed from groups of 10 viruses. The virus stock was thawed at room temperature and 180 \u03bcl was mixed with 20 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 DNase I buffer (100 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2). A cocktail of nucleases was added to degrade host nucleic acids as previously described (Victoria et al., 2008). The cocktail consisted of (per virus sample) 5 units DNase I (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10 units Turbo-DNase (Life Technologies), 5 units Base-line Zero DNase (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA), 25 units benzonase (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 2 \u03bcg RNase A/5 units RNase T1 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 4 units RNase One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The virus stock/nuclease mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 90 min. The viral RNA was purified using the MinElute Virus spin filter kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's specifications. The RNA was eluted in 22 \u03bcl of ultra-pure, RNase-free H2O (final yield \u223c20 \u03bcl) and immediately placed on ice.",

            "text": "Twenty microliters of RNA were mixed with 100 pmol of a 28mer primer consisting of 20 nucleotides of a known sequence followed by 8 random nucleotides as previously described (Victoria et al., 2009). Table 1\nshows the sequence of the 20 primers used in this study. These primers were developed so that the 20 base known sequence was used for PCR amplification of the library as well as served as a barcode for identifying each viral library following pooling and sequencing. The RNA/primer mix was heated at 75 \u00b0C for 5 min and immediately placed on ice. First strand synthesis was done in a reaction mix consisting of 0.5 mM dNTPs, 1\u00d7 first strand buffer, 2 units RNasin (Promega) and 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The first strand reactions were incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h, heated at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and immediately quenched on ice. The second strand reaction was carried out using Sequenase 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the nucleotides and primers still present following the first strand reaction (Yozwiak et al., 2012). An equal volume of 2\u00d7 Sequenase buffer with 4 units of Sequenase per reaction was added on ice. The reaction tubes were placed in a thermocycler that was prechilled to 4 \u00b0C and were ramped from 4 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C at 0.1 \u00b0C/s. The reaction was continued at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. The tubes were heated to 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and placed immediately on ice. A second aliquot of Sequenase was added (4 units/reaction) and the ramping and incubation repeated with the exception that the 37 \u00b0C reaction was done for 30 min. The double stranded cDNA was purified using Minelute PCR spin columns (Qiagen) and eluted with 13 \u03bcl of ultra-pure H2O. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers consisting of the first 20 known bases of the 28mer used in the cDNA synthesis (Victoria et al., 2009). The PCR reactions consisted of 10 \u03bcl of double-stranded cDNA, 1\u00d7 Pfx50 buffer, 400 \u03bcM dNTPs, 100 pM of appropriate 20mer primer and 5 units of Pfx50 polymerase (Life Technologies). The reactions were cycled at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. The number of cycles was empirically determined so as not to over amplify the cDNA, where 35 cycles worked well. The DNA was again purified and eluted in 10 \u03bcl ultra-pure H2O, and 1 \u03bcl subjected to Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The percentage of the DNA that was 300\u2013400 bp in length was determined for each reaction as was the total DNA concentration in each sample using PicoGreen (Life Technologies). All ten reactions were pooled so that the 300\u2013400 bp cDNAs from each were present in equimolar amounts. The pooled DNA was placed in an end-repair reaction (Ion Plus Fragment Library kit, Life Technologies) followed by ligation of Ion Torrent sequencing adaptors. The DNA was size fractionated using Agencourt Ampure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) using 1.6 volumes of the Ampure beads and was done according to manufacturer specifications. This step removed DNA of 100 bp and less which eliminated adaptor dimers and unligated adaptors. At this point, two 10-genome libraries, for a total of 20 genomes, were pooled for each sequencing run. The 300\u2013400 bp fraction was isolated from the DNA pool using the Pippin Prep (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). The 300\u2013400 bp DNA was subjected to sequence analysis with the Ion Torrent PGM and standard chemistries (Life Technologies) using the 316 sequencing chip.",

Barcode sequences unique to this study were used to populate a custom configuration file that was used in conjunction with the Roche \u201csfffile\u201d tool to separate the reads into individual barcode-specific SFF files. All the sequences in each barcode-specific SFF file was extracted to a FASTQ file by applying the \u201csff_extract\u201d utility (http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/sff_extract/index.html) and specifying the \u201c\u2014clip\u201d option to remove the sequencing tags, barcode sequences, and low quality sequences. The \u201cfastx_trimmer\u201d program (part of the Fastx ToolKit; http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html) was used to remove the random primer (8-mer) by trimming an additional eight nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end of each read. As a final post-trimming step, a custom script was used to remove all reads that were less than 40 nucleotides in length. The resulting sequence files were used to assemble full length genomic sequences using SeqManNGen and were edited with the SeqMan software of the Lasergene 10 package (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) using related viral sequences obtained from GenBank as the assembly reference. Assembled genomic sequences were further edited using Aligner (Codoncode, Inc., Centerville, MA, USA). The sequences from each library were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive with the BioProject number PRJNA237789, BioSamples SAMN02630193, and SAMN02639534 through SAMN02639572.",

Thus, it required more sequences overall to assemble the complete genome to the same coverage depth. Additionally, because BoCV typically grows to a lower titer, there were lower ratios of virus:host sequences, ranging from 2.7 to 37.8% of the total sequences. A major difference in genome assembly between BVDV and BoCV was that, with only a few exceptions, both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences were determined for each BoCV isolate. Also, due to the longer length of the BoCV genome, more assembly gaps were observed. However, in all cases, assembled sequences spanned more than 97% of the viral genome. More assembly gaps were observed in individual virus libraries having lower total sequences.

Often, a clinical report and history is available for isolates making it possible to begin association of genotype with specific phenotypes and time of isolation. Particularly valuable is that this protocol confers the ability to sequence archival collections of specific viruses rapidly in order to study the evolution of the pathogen over time and determine the genotype of the viruses currently in circulation.

Thus, the abundance of host nucleic acids posed a problem in obtaining sufficient numbers of viral sequences to assemble the viral genomes. It was necessary to pre-digest virus samples with high levels of nucleases before purification of viral RNA. The viral RNA was protected within the intact virions while the host RNA and DNA were degraded. The RNA purification procedure included a protease digestion step aiding in the removal of the nucleases before the viral RNA was released from the virion. The nuclease digestion step aided in reaching as much as 87% of all sequences in a barcoded library being of viral origin. Again, the titer of the virus in the original sample was also important in the number of viral sequences obtained. Viruses that grow routinely to low titers require less than 20 libraries in the sequencing run to ensure sufficient reads in each barcoded library to assemble the genomes.",

The Ion Torrent is known to have indels in the sequence data, especially associated with homopolymeric runs of bases (Bragg et al., 2013). Use of template assisted assembly of the genomes greatly assisted in producing accurate genome assemblies. Limited numbers of de novo assemblies were done and low numbers of errors were found that were attributed to indels. The accuracy of sequences generated by this method was demonstrated by the comparing sequences to those previously generated by Sanger PCR amplicon sequencing. Only 1 nucleotide difference was detected in sequences generated using the two different methods demonstrating the accuracy of the sequencing using the protocol described in this paper.",

This may have made priming of first strand cDNA synthesis near the termini more difficult. With the exception of one virus, all BVDV genomes were assembled with no internal gaps in the sequence. The BVDV genome that was not fully assembled had only 658 total viral sequences, yet this was sufficient to assemble greater than 94% of the genome.
