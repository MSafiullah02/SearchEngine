Pathogenesis is complex and thought to result from the interaction between genetic, environmental and immunologic factors; key players in this process are T cells, antigen presenting cells, keratinocytes, Langerhans' cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, as well as multiple cytokines and growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor [1] . In recent years, the mindset has shifted from one of a Th1-driven immune response with IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 as the signature cytokines to one in which the IL-23/Th17 axis with IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 plays a more central role [2] .",

Proinflammatory molecules released during chronic inflammation are implicated in certain comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and depression. Conversely, epidemiological evidence infers that obesity, via pro-inflammatory pathways, predisposes to both development and progression of psoriasis [3] . This association is shared with metabolic syndrome (MetS), not least the increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and the ensuing cardiovascular morbidity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Recent studies have suggested that adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin, produced by adipocytes and dysregulated in obesity and MetS, are the linchpins of this metabolic association in psoriatic disease. They have been shown to contribute independently to the adverse cardiovascular 3 outcomes in patients with Pso and can be viewed as biomarkers of obesity-related inflammation and cardiovascular risk (9) . With this is mind, one should consider adipose tissue as an endocrine organ that has the capabilities, through local and systemic factors, to induce a low-level inflammatory state. Moreover, specific IL-17-secreting Th17 cells and IL-22-secreting Th22 cells have been seen to infiltrate the adipose tissue and represent local mediators of inflammation and insulin resistance, something that is being studied in more detail.",

Strengths of the review include use of a high degree of rigor in its search strategy and screening procedures, using relevant standards for performing systematic reviews. We tried to reflect the complete picture of both published and unpublished literature on this topic. The last decade has seen an exciting expansion of interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition. Our study provides evidence for a relationship between certain body composition phenotypes and the occurrence of psoriasis, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia that is similar, yet distinct, from the metabolic syndrome. Several aspects of body composition, specifically the amount and distribution of body fat and lean mass, are now understood to be important health outcomes in adults and should form an important part of the ongoing clinical assessment of patients with psoriasis. However, the issue of whether body compartment distribution is a result of severe psoriasis or a causative factor in its development remains contentious. It is likely that novel systems will eventually supplement less sophisticated bedside measurements and influence key aspects of risk assessment, prognostication and management.",

As expected, parameters associated with obesity, such as weight, body fat percentage, fat mass, and degree of obesity, were higher in the psoriasis groups than in the control groups, irrespective of therapy. Such an association between obesity and psoriasis has been well documented, first described in 1986 [42] . Traditional epidemiological studies have focused on weight or BMI to define obesity rather than altered body composition. We found conflicting data on the association between psoriasis severity, such as PASI, and body composition parameters, indicating that a causal link is not definitive. Previous studies have alluded to a dose-response relationship between psoriasis severity and metabolic syndrome [43], supported by translational studies showing T-helper cell cytokine upregulation in the blood and skin of psoriasis patients, leading to effects on lipid metabolism and insulin resistance [44] .",

IL-17, one of the key proinflammatory cytokines in psoriasis, mechanistically links inflammation with insulin resistance and adipocyte dysfunction [47] . IL-17A producing cells are thought to be pathogenic in driving inflammation in obesity and progression of obesityrelated inflammatory diseases, suggesting that causality between psoriasis and adipogenesis is likely to be bidirectional [48] .

BIA assessment tools have been considered a promising approach for the quantitative measurement of tissue characteristics over time, as well as demonstrating the direct relativity between fluctuations in body composition and prognosis, clinical condition and quality of life [49] . The technique offers reliable data on body composition provided that suitable (i.e. age-, sex-and populationspecific) equations for the calculation of body compartments are applied [50].

It is defined as the ratio of resistance (intracellular and extracellular resistance) to reactance (cell membrane-specific resistance), expressed as an angle. It is considered an indicator of cellular health, where higher values reflect cell membrane integrity and better cell function. In healthy populations, increasing age bestows a lower PhA due to a reduction in reactance and a parallel loss of muscle mass and an increase in resistance due to the declining proportion of body water at the expense of fat mass. In disease, PhA is often reduced because of infection, inflammation or disease-specific determinants [51] . Recent studies have reported that PhA in humans follows a linear relationship with cellular health and can be considered a prognostic tool in certain medical disorders, including cancer, cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus [22, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] .

Secondly, there was poor matching of patients and controls across all studies and little consideration for the potential confounding effects of key determinants of metabolism, e.g. physical activity, age and smoking. Finally, BIA-estimated percentage of body fat varies greatly with population and age and is directly and closely related to various health outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases. Despite its prognostic potential, BIA has not been validated in population studies or clinical practice due to lack of normal population reference limits for comparison and is also influenced by other factors such as age, sex and race [57].",

WC was higher in patients with PsO compared to their controls. Leptin, leptin/fat mass ratio, and total adiponectin were elevated in PsA. Insulin levels and HOMA were increased in both PsO and PsA groups. In patients with PsO, android and visceral fat were correlated with SCORE (r=0.3, p=0.02 and r= 0.6, p < 0.0001 respectively). EFT was significantly associated with MS (P < 0.01), age (P < 0.05) and female gender (P < 0.05) in psoriasis patients only.",
