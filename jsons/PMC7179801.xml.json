            "text": "Although the debate on whether SARS-CoV-2 is airborne versus droplet is still raging [2\u20137], SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious compared with the following: SARS-CoV-1, the coronavirus that led to the SARS epidemic in 2002 [8]; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the coronavirus that led to MERS in 2012 [9]; and seasonal viral influenza. Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread exponentially worldwide since the cluster of infections in Wuhan Province was first reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019 [10]. As of this writing, worldwide estimates of COVID-19 cases exceed 1.8 million, a number that is likely grossly underestimated due to inadequate testing capability in many settings. Although the airborne versus droplet question is relevant to healthcare settings (which involve close contact) and has guided infection control recommendations and type of masks required accordingly [7, 10], the most compelling reason for public masking is due to the data on spread from asymptomatic individuals [11]. For the general public, surgical isolation masks (as part of an overall public health strategy) should be able to curb dissemination of both droplet-spread and airborne viruses to the breathing zones of nearby individuals [12\u201317].",

Finally, after identification of a case of COVID-19 in a HCW in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Washington State, 76 residents of the SNF were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 (63%) had positive swabs, with 27 (56%) being paucisymptomatic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were quantitatively similar in those with symptoms and those who were asymptomatic [11], with viral culture demonstrating viability even before symptoms.",

Analysis of presymptomatic and symptomatic patients demonstrates high viral loads and viable virus readily isolated in culture shortly before and after the onset of symptoms [27]. A study detailing the clinical and virological characteristics of 5 patients in France showed that 2 patients had high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions soon after symptom onset [28]. Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads than those in upper respiratory samples during the phase of active pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 [29]. However, high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract samples among patients \u201cwithout symptoms\u201d suggest a high risk of transmissibility [30]. Modeling studies have also demonstrated that paucisymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for a large proportion of transmissions [31, 32], with early case reports and familial clusters also indicating asymptomatic transmission [33\u201340]. In sum, the degree of transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals in SARS-CoV-2 is the most compelling argument for universal public masking.",

Universal cloth face masking for the public was recommended by the CDC on April 3, 2020, but it has been actively debated in the White House [43].",

Asian countries were heavily impacted by SARS-CoV-1 [8], which may have led to a more rapid institution of universal masking for SARS-CoV-2 [47]. In the early stages of the epidemic, Taiwan immediately increased its capacity to mass produce surgical isolation masks for HCWs and the public [28], and they announced plans on April 1, 2020 to donate 10 million masks to countries most severely impacted by the coronavirus.",

Industries in the United States can repurpose to produce surgical masks in vast quantities for the public [48] (as in Taiwan) [45], and such production will allow equal access to mask supplies across all strata of society. The CDC has provided guidance on which cloth materials are the most effective for preventing the spread of respiratory droplets [12, 49], although ensuring that equality to access is imperative and recommendations on how to prolong the life of disposable masks and reuse masks are widespread [50]. Another major concern is that the public will let their \u201cguard down\u201d with masking [2]. This can be addressed with strong public health messaging performed in tandem with new policy.",

Taiwan, with the most consistent supply of surgical isolation masks for its people (including medical, public and industrial sectors), and with stringent social distancing guidelines and other public health measures, has maintained control of its epidemic without mandating work and school closure. When social distancing is not possible, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control has mandated that members of the public wear face masks, including on public transportation where fines may be incurred for noncompliance. The country of Taiwan remains one of the most controlled in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic to date, with 388 cases and 6 deaths as of April 12, 2020 [51]. An eventual and cautious recommendation for a return to work in the United States, with public masks for crowded indoor or outdoor spaces as one component of the updated guidelines, could provide much-needed relief for the economy. Tips for how children can be encouraged to wear face masks are already emerging [52].",
