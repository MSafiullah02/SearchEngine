Motivated by the ongoing response to COVID-19, we provide a toolkit of statistical and mathematical models beyond the simple SIRtype differential equation models for analysing the early stages of an outbreak and assessing interventions. In particular, we focus on parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in the data, and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed subpopulations, such as households and care homes. We illustrate these methods by applying them to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Since the pioneering work of Ross in malaria modelling [73] and Kermack and McKendrick's general epidemic models [42] , there has been gathering interest in using math-ematical tools to investigate infectious diseases. The allure is clear, since mathematical models can provide powerful insight into how these complex systems behave, which in turn can enable these problems to be better controlled/prevented. Not only is the power of the mathematical tools increasing, but the availability of data on infectious diseases, whether this be a rapid release of data during an outbreak or detailed collection of data for endemic pathogens, is increasing. Rapid interpretation of epidemiological data is critical for the development of effective containment, suppression and mitigation interventions, but there are many difficulties to interpreting case data in real-time.",

Mathematical and statistical techniques can help overcome some of these challenges to interpretation, aiding in the development of intervention strategies and management of care. Examining key epidemiological quantities alongside each other in a transmission model can provide quantitative insights into the outbreak, testing the potential impact of intervention strategies and predicting the risk posed to the human (or animal) host population and healthcare preparedness.",

In January, this outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. The initial spread of the pathogen in Wuhan was fast, and after a period of case-finding and contact tracing, China moved to implement a 'shutdown' of Wuhan on January 23, and other cities in China the following days, to try to suppress the growth of the epidemic. These measures may have succeeded at slowing down the rate at which cases have been seeded elsewhere, but in many countries initial importation of cases and transmission has not been contained. Countries around the world are now seeing outbreaks that are overwhelming, or have the potential to overwhelm, healthcare systems and cause a high number of deaths even in high-income countries [70] .",

Large values of R 0 mean a substantial amount of transmission needs to be halted; fast growth causes the number of cases in the absence of interventions to rise rapidly, so that the time scale of interventions to reduce R 0 must also be fast in order to effect substantive early changes on a population level; finally, the resulting interventions must encompass possible pre-and asymptomatic cases, a challenging prospect when in many instances these individuals are indistinguishable from healthy individuals. Consequently, we must consider the possibility of interventions that are massively disruptive to society and may have to be sustained for a long period of time in order to cause the number of infections to decline towards zero [27] . If infections remain, and the susceptible proportion of the population remains above the herd immunity threshold, these interventions must be upheld to prevent a second wave of the epidemic. There is not yet conclusive evidence as to the degree and duration of immunity conferred by infection with SARS-CoV2 nor the feasibility of a vaccine, the timeline for which is unlikely to be any time shorter than 18 months away at the time of writing [38] . Therefore, short term extreme interventions are not as effective as they might be in other circumstances, since after their removal there remains a long period of time in which cases can rise again. The longer these significantly suppressive and disruptive interventions are in effect, the more severe the effect on the economy, and broader societal health and well-being. Furthermore, adherence to interventions will likely vary with their duration and severity.",

Some parameters do appear to be similar to these pathogens, such as the average length of the incubation period [46, 85, 86] . However, there are also clear differences, with both SARS and MERS being more fatal, but seemingly less efficient at spreading since they did not seed major global pandemics. Another complication is the spread of the infection during the Chinese Spring Festival, a time period during which movement, social, and contact patterns vary significantly. This presents significant challenges as experience and intuition from other studies regarding population mixing and spatial patterns must either be modified or are invalid. Furthermore, the pandemic has received a proportionately larger level of public attention than e.g. the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [20, 74] , largely boosted by social media. This greater level of public awareness, and the successive, staggered interventions placed to prevent disease spread are responsible for significant variations in behaviour [17, 30] and adherence to public guidance both in China and abroad.",

In Section 2, we discuss various biases that are present in outbreak data and techniques for estimating epidemiological parameters. Accounting for biases and producing robust parameter estimates is important throughout the duration of an epidemic, both for increasing our understanding of the underlying dynamics, and for feeding into models. Firstly, we discuss a bias-corrected method for estimating the incubation period, which can also be applied to serial intervals, onset-to-death time, and other delay distributions. We then present a method for estimating the true growth rate of the epidemic, accounting for the bias encountered since infected individuals may be exported from the region. Our next method is a tool for estimating the expected size of the next generation of infectives based on the rate of observed cases. This tool provides insight into the size of small outbreaks, which can inform decision making when trying to prevent a major outbreak taking off. We end this section with a selection of bias corrected estimates of: incubation period, doubling time, and onset-to-hospitalisation.",

These models focus on enclosed populations, since this is the level at which most interventions are implemented. Since the disease is particularly fatal in the elderly and other at risk groups, we develop a care home model to investigate how the pathogen may spread through care homes. We also develop household models to investigate the impact of different intervention/control strategies. These models can inform policy design for mitigating or controlling epidemic spread. Finally, in the context of relaxing strong social distancing policies, we investigate the extinction probability of the pathogen. We first consider the extinction probability after lifting restrictions. We then develop a household-based contact tracing model, with which we investigate the extinction probability under weaker isolation policies paired with contact tracing, thus shedding light on possible combination of interventions that allow to feasibly manage the infection while minimising the social impact of control policies.",

If an individual can be followed indefinitely, it is easy to determine the length of these events. However, in reality only events that occur before a given date are observed. Therefore, the data is subject to censoring and truncation issues. In the incubation period, for example, censoring comes into play since, if we have observed an infection but the individual has not yet developed symptoms, we only have a lower bound on how long it will take them to develop symptoms. To account for this, we can instead condition on observing symptom onset before the cut-off date. However, this leads to a truncation issue, since individuals who were infected close to the cut-off date will only be observed if they have a short incubation period, which leads to an overexpression of short delays.",

We can assume these individuals were infected in Wuhan, since at the time of this data, the force of infection was significantly higher in Wuhan than elsewhere. The length of time spent in Wuhan therefore provides a window during which each individual became infected, and for many of these individuals we also have the date of symptom onset.

For example, consider the quarantine strategy deployed in many countries during the early stages of the epidemic, aimed at preventing cases being imported from Wuhan. This strategy quarantined individuals upon their return from Wuhan for 14 days. For such a strategy to be effective, we require most incubation periods to be less than 14 days, so that the majority of infected people would develop symptoms before quarantine ended, enabling them to be further isolated. In this analysis, we show that in the worst-case scenario we would expect 1 in 62 cases to slip through this quarantine, with the best fit predicting 1 in 101 cases. Therefore, the 14 day quarantine period would capture the majority of cases. Throughout the epidemic, this seems to have been reasonably successful, and prevented early seeding of cases in many countries. However, potentially due to complicated travel patterns or asymptomatic transmission, cases have slipped through detection and not been quarantined, which unfortunately has led to the situation observed today.",

These underestimates can be improved by looking at the total number of cases across all known affected regions, but doing so introduces further complications. For example, if an individual has less severe symptoms they may not seek medical assistance, thereby not being recorded as a case at their destination. This underestimation of cases can have significant effects if the traveller is able to infect more people. A new transmission chain can thus be started which remains undetected for some time due to a lacking known connection to the \"origin\" region.",

Indeed, let us assume that R 0 is reduced to zero by the intervention: for example, assume that social distancing is perfect and the number of contacts of a fully-adherent individual is zero. If only 50% of people adhere to the intervention then the average number of contacts is effectively reduced by a half and logically R \u2020 0 = R 0 /2 = 1.5 (the \u2020 representing quantities post intervention) and R(\u221e) \u2020 = 0.58 in this case. However, this assumes that adherence is an independent random process at each contact. This suggests that for each contact an individual would ordinarily make, they \"toss a coin\" to decide whether to isolate or not. In reality, individuals are more likely to show polarity, where some individuals reduce all their contacts and follow the measures and a proportion of individuals choose to not adhere to the intervention. If there was distinct polarity in the population such that 50% adhered perfectly and 50% ignored policy, then a toy model can be created with two infectious groups, I A and I B , that behave differently.

For other care homes, we allow this probability to be proportional to its size, under the assumption that larger care homes employ more staff and are therefore at higher risk of introduction. When the infection pressure becomes higher than an individual care home's resilience threshold, that care home begins its own deterministic infection dynamics with a single initial infected case. We run this model on data for the entire care home population in the UK, so that there are approximately 15,000 care homes with a total population of approximately 450,000 residents [22] . In this model we only consider the vulnerable population within care homes. We assume R 0 = 1.5 in the background epidemic, a relatively low value that somehow accounts for a certain degree of control, and an R C = 3 to allow relatively explosive epidemics in care homes due to potentially more frail individuals, difficulty in isolation and staff inadvertently passing the infection from one case to the next. The other parameters in the baseline scenario are reported in Table 6 . There are a variety of assumptions underpinning this model. Firstly, the background epidemic ignores structure and assumes homogeneous mixing. This is likely to make the peak more pronounced, so presents a worst case scenario for the demand on hospital beds. The assumption of R 0 for the background epidemic only affects the shape and duration of the background epidemic, since the tuneable parameter p controls the risk of introduction Week of peak bed occupancy by carehome population",

Right plot shows the timing of the peak, which always appears to occur at a similar time or later, compared to the background epidemic. The peak arrives earlier for larger values of p, as high p corresponds to multiple simultaneous introductions early on in the background epidemic. to the care home. That is, if R 0 is small, a large p still presents a high force of infection into the care homes. Therefore, for a fixed p, we expect that changing R 0 does not affect the total number of deaths, but it changes the peak hospitalisation incidence because a faster and more explosive background epidemic makes epidemics in care homes more synchronised. In fact, when testing the impact of a longer, flatter background epidemic, for example obtained by simulating three slightly desynchronised background SEIR epidemics, results have lower peaks and a much more variable timing (not shown). Assuming each care home is independent might not be realistic, since it is likely that staff are shared between multiple homes, in which case they can act as vectors of transmission between homes. However, current outbreaks are already quite synchronised (the within care home outbreaks occur at similar times), so the effect of this assumption is likely to be minimal. The final major assumption is that the epidemic within the care homes is deterministic. This removes the probability of random extinction and random delays, and should obviously be relaxed with a stochastic model, given half of care homes have size smaller than 25. However, the extinction probability is very low with R C = 3, so this stochastic effect is unlikely to have a large impact. Random delays, instead, may change the shape and timing of the epidemic, which could potentially reduce the peak burden. Therefore, this model represents a worst case scenario.",

First, exact theoretical or asymptotic results in these models are mostly restricted to time-integrated quantities, i.e. those quantities that do not depend on the detailed temporal shape at which the infectivity is spread by an individual: these are R 0 (or any other reproduction number [11, 65] , e.g. the household reproduction number R * ), the probability of a large epidemic, and the epidemic final size [4] . For this reason, the vast majority of the literature relies on the standard stochastic SIR model [4] , despite its unrealistic infectivity profile. Even if more recent work has expanded beyond time integrated quantities, for example considering the real-time growth rate [11, 67] , if the interest is on tracking the dynamics of infection spread, a model based on full temporal representation of between-and within-household dynamics [36] appears necessary.",

The second approach has a greater emphasis on within-household dynamics, and is fundamentally an independent-households, individual-based, stochastic simulation. The more limited mathematical tractability is the price to pay for an increased flexibility, as the within-household Markov assumption is relaxed and exact distributions for delays between events, typically informed by the data, can be explicitly inputted. Although both approaches can account for increased within-household transmission as isolation and quarantine are imposed, we only consider this for the second method here.

We use this model to investigate the relative effectiveness of the different control policies. We also consider allowing recovered individuals to leave the household, even in the context of household isolation or household quarantine. This has no impact on the transmission dynamics, but reduces the individuals' life disruption and potential economic cost of any policy implemented. This model assumes that there is no reintroduction within households so each household can only be isolated or quarantined once. The assumption that only one household member is infected from outside is approximately satisfied if we assume homogeneous mixing between households and a large number of households, which are all fully susceptible at the start of the epidemic. However, the reality of heterogeneous mixing makes reintroduction a likely possibility even early on in the epidemic. This model, therefore, lacks an explicit description of the social network structure beyond the household. For simplicity, we assume that within households all individuals are identical in terms of their disease dynamics, although the method might be extended to allow for different age/risk groups with different disease dynamics. We assume that the level of within-household transmission in a household of size n scales proportionally to 1/(n \u2212 1), though we acknowledge that true transmission is slightly more complex [19] .",

All random numbers involved in the realisation of the stochastic epidemic are drawn at the start, before the impact of each control policy is implemented. Row 1 shows no isolation and individual and isolation. Rows 2, 3 and 4 show, respectively, household isolation, mixed isolation and household quarantine. The difference between the columns is that the basic policy on the left is \"upgraded\" to the more cost-effective version on the right that allows recovered individuals to leave the house as they cannot transmit outside anymore. When no control is implemented, the primary case (individual A, say, infected at time 0) infects another individual (B, say) around time 11. After a long latent period (i.e. incubation minus prodromal), B becomes infectious and infects a further individual (C, say). The last individual (D, say) escapes infection. When different intervention strategies are in place, within-household infectivity is increased. This can result in individual C becoming infected earlier in the outbreak and individual D no longer escaping infection, both due to the increased force of infection. In this simulation, the dynamics for individual B do not change since they are infected before A becomes symptomatic. Individual D is infected earliest under mixed isolation, because within-household transmission is higher than household isolation alone, due to increased adherence from individual isolation also being in place. Adherence levels to household quarantine are lower than those of household isolation, due to the higher demand of full quarantine, thus leading to less enhanced within-household transmission. The more severe the intervention, the better it captures the infectious periods of infected individuals within the household.",

In (a)-(c), line styles refer to different control policies and colours to different levels of adherence to individual isolation. The x-axis gives the adherence to household quarantine, and household isolation (which is less demanding) is assumed to be \"twice as high\", meaning it is at the midpoint between that of household quarantine and 1 (e.g. 0.6 for an x value of 0.2, 0.9 for an x value of 0.8, etc.). The black dash-dotted line in (a) gives the amount needed to control the spread by achieving R * = 1. Notice how: the effect of individual isolation is independent of adherence to household quarantine (dotted lines); the effect of household isolation is independent of adherence to individual isolation (overlapping dash-dotted lines); mixed isolation is always superior to household isolation; household quarantine is only optimal at really high levels of adherence (for these baseline parameters, generally, beyond the level needed to achieve control), but quickly becomes suboptimal to mixed isolation as adherence is reduced. When a sufficiently large reduction in R * is achieved in (a), the growth rate drops to 0 in (b). The increased risk an initially susceptible vulnerable person is infected at home (c) does not reflect this effect, as it represents the increased risk conditional on a introduction: if the infection were controlled in the community, the overall risk of a vulnerable person getting infected would vanish as the risk of introduction in the household vanishes. For these plots, ne = 10000 simulations are performed for each household size. Nevertheless, a large amount of stochastic noise is still visible in (c). In (d), the same control policies are considered, but the household-based ones are considered both in their na\u00efve form (where recovered individuals remain isolated), and in their upgraded version where recovered individuals are free to leave the house: they are identical in terms of transmission but the na\u00efve versions are significantly more costly in terms of person-days of isolation. In a household of size 1 (no within-household transmission), the days in isolation would be exactly 7 or 14 if all cases were symptomatic (here ps = 2/3); similarly, in all households, individual isolation would total exactly 7 days if all cases were symptomatic and all individuals in the household were ultimately infected.",

It should be noted that q(t) concerns the best case scenario with only one initial case. Increasing the number of initial cases n 0 scales the probability of extinction by q(t) n0 . These probabilities suggest that, without widespread immunity, stochastic extinction might be aided by social distancing but is heavily compromised by immigration. Border controls, therefore, if of limited use when transmission is self-sustaining, become key when the number of cases is low. Note that we have assumed an importation function \u03b7(t) that goes to 0 for large t, in line with a pandemic that goes extinct in other geographical regions. However, the presence of an animal reservoir might lead to an importation function that is non-zero over longer time scales, thus effectively making ultimate extinction impossible unless the effective reproduction number is kept below one by a systematic and permanent intervention (e.g. technology-based change in behaviour) or herd immunity.

For COVID-19, some of these challenges include mild symptoms which cause infections not to be reported, pre-symptomatic transmission which occurs before a case is reported, and short generation times [31] which can cause the epidemic to outrun contact tracing. Additionally, contact tracing is only feasible for smaller case numbers, because each case generates multiple contacts to follow up, so the tracing workload expands dramatically, and an increasing number of chains remain unobserved. This makes it a viable strategy in the early days of an outbreak, or, if containment has failed, following a period of severe interventions, such as a lockdown. Combining contact tracing with isolation is being considered by many countries as part of a test, trace and isolate strategy to be implemented once lockdowns or comparable measures are lifted, provided these lockdowns succeed at driving case numbers sufficiently low. In this section, we develop a household-level contact tracing model for an emerging outbreak, since we do not wish to make assumptions about immunity or depletion of susceptibles. These assumptions can be added to the model as the availability of data into immunity improves. We are interested in the likelihood that the contact tracing process is overwhelmed by large case numbers and the likelihood that, combined with isolation, it can drive the disease to extinction.",

To demonstrate this, we assume that contact tracing successfully traces two thirds of contacts. Trained professionals have to trace all reported contacts from the last 14 days, so we assume that the contact tracing delay follows a Geometric distribution with a mean of 2 days.

The health agency must remain in contact for the duration of the 14 day self-isolation period, so that if any individual under isolation develops symptoms and then tests positive, the contact tracing process can be initiated on this node. We will define the capacity of the contact tracing process to be the number of people that can be placed under observation and assume two possible capacities: 800 and 8000. We assume that when a node is contact traced, they are asked to report their global contacts for the last 14 days. All global contacts are assumed to be to a new person since we are in the early stages of an outbreak. We carried out 6507 simulations of the contact tracing process for 150 days. Contact tracing capacity was reached in 5000 simulations, and in 180 the epidemic neither went extinct nor was the 8000 capacity reached. In the remaining simulations, the epidemic went extinct. Figure 11a and Table 7 show that increasing the contact tracing capacity tenfold less than doubles the time until that capacity is reached. However, it does increase the odds of driving the epidemic to extinction without hitting the capacity by about 10% (Table 7) . Different contact tracing strategies will strain different aspects of the health agency. A strategy that generates large amounts of work is only feasible if there are few active infections. The optimal strategy will need to compromise and may need to change depending on the number of active infections, which cannot be directly observed.",

The distribution takes the shape of a generalised extreme value distribution, and there are several epidemics that still have not gone extinct after interventions have been in effect for long periods of time, which exemplifies how difficult it can be to make an epidemic extinct. Additionally, this model only considers extinction under the assumption that no cases are imported. In Section 3.4, we have shown that importation of cases significantly reduces the extinction probability. This suggests that extinction may no longer be guaranteed, and the time to extinction will be significantly increased. This analysis has focused on a single contact tracing strategy using indicative parameters for COVID-19. The proposed model can be extended to more strategies and region specific parameters to inform the design of control policies. Also, as is shown in Table 7 , contact tracing capacity is likely to be reached, which may prevent extinction from being achieved. This complication is compounded by the issues of loss of immunity or the presence of an animal reservoir discussed in Section 3.4.",

Parameter estimates are obtained using a certain set of assumptions regarding the data, and investigations or simulations utilising these estimates should ensure that their underlying assumptions are consistent. These challenges in model construction and applicability of statistical methods are compounded by the limitations of the data with which decisions must be made. Some of the biases present in the data can be addressed with an improved data collection methodology -often challenging in the context of a fast-moving outbreak -but many are also inherent to the nature of early outbreak data [16, 47] . The consequent lack of intuitive insight from this data underscores the need for careful parametric estimates, especially considering the large variability in predicted outcomes resulting from small differences in parameters.

We use these methods to account for these biases when estimating delay distributions, such as the incubation period and hospitalisation-to-death delay, and the growth rate/doubling time (results given in Table 5 ). These biases can have significant impact when estimating key parameters: the mean incubation period estimates for COVID-19 range from 3.48 days without correcting for truncation to 4.84 days with the correction, and the doubling time in Hubei province decreases from 3.15 days without correcting for travel to 2.77 days. These differences can significantly alter our understanding of the outbreak, and could have a large impact on policy and public health. For instance, underestimating the incubation period may lead to quarantine strategies failing to identify infected individuals if the quarantine length is too short. Overestimating the doubling time (or underestimating the growth rate) will underestimate the risk posed to the host population -both in terms of final size of the epidemic and the rate at which it spreads, which can have significant public health impacts as discussed in [68] .",

We do so by regarding care homes as closed populations that are subjected to a force of infection from an external epidemic. We develop a tool for analysing the risk posed to this population by determining the peak size of the epidemic within the care homes and the number of deaths. Applying this model to COVID-19, we find that by \"cocooning\" the care homes, i.e. shielding them to reduce the chance of introduction from the external outbreak, we can significantly reduce the size of the peak and therefore reduce the number of deaths. However, assessing the necessary level of shielding requires accurate characterisation of the external force of infection, and underestimating this may invalidate shielding efforts. A limitation to the proposed model is the deterministic within care home epidemic. However, since the average size of care homes is relatively large and we assume a high R 0 within care homes, the deterministic assumption is unlikely to significantly alter the conclusions.",

Therefore, it is important to consider stochastic effects within each household, combined with between-household dynamics. We consider two different household models: one which contains features of both within-and between-household transmission, where small-scale transmission can be linked to the epidemic on a population level, and another which facilitates more detail in the within-household transmission and delay distributions, but with reduced correspondence to the population-wide transmission. With the first model, a 65% adherence to household isolation appears insufficient to control the epidemic without severe global reductions in transmission. Coupled with a short term global reduction, the epidemic can be controlled, but upon lifting the global intervention, which could take the form of a lockdown, household isolation is insufficient to maintain control. For the second model, we look into changing the strength of adherence, and the impact this can have on achieving control.",

However, such a high level of adherence may be difficult to maintain in the long-term and this modicum of control is anyway highly sensitive to the chosen parameters. We further investigated the efficacy of various isolation or quarantine measures. A policy of individual isolation struggles to curtail the epidemic for any adherence. Instead, mixed isolation, whereby first the whole household isolates and any individual infected during isolation goes on to self isolate after household isolation is lifted, appears to be the most cost-effective strategy.",

We have shown however, that the probability of the epidemic becoming extinct once these policies are lifted, even when very few cases remain, is very small. We therefore consider a contact tracing intervention as a potential strategy for managing the COVID-19 outbreak, once severe lockdown interventions are lifted. We developed a household-level contact tracing model to explore the feasibility of combining these strategies to control the epidemic. Firstly, we noted that by using knowledge of household structure, we can reduce the burden on the contact tracing process by isolating household and removing them from the contact tracing process once an infected member has been identified. Secondly, we investigated how contact tracing combined with household isolation may drive the disease to extinction, finding that aggressive contact tracing coupled with household isolation can drive the epidemic to extinction under the indicative parameters assumed, when starting with a single infection.",

To address some of these, we have described a variety of techniques to serve as part of a generally applicable toolkit. However, our proposed models, and many other models, are subject to important limitations which must be considered prior to their application. Key among these is the lack of heterogeneous population mixing, such as through age-stratification [66] and different risk-groups [83] , and spatio-temporal variations [45] , all of which influence modelling estimates and predictions. Nevertheless, the relative simplicity of the presented models allows for the development of qualitative intuition regarding the efficacy of various intervention methods, whilst providing tractable theoretical frameworks which can be further developed and better inform policy-makers.",

It also shows the impact that changing p has on the timing of the peak. Reducing p corresponds to increasing protection of the vulnerable population in care homes by preventing introduction of infection (e.g. screening, testing and promoting hygiene among staff, etc.), a policy sometimes termed 'cocooning' or 'shielding'. The results show that reducing p from 0.99 to 0.1 corresponds to a reduction of around 22,000 (83%) in the number of deaths and around 131,500 in the number of hospitalisations (83%).Strategies aimed at reducing the probability of introduction into a care home, such as reducing the number of visitors or increased monitoring and protection of care home staff, are therefore predicted to have a large impact on the number of cases in vulnerable care home populations.",

This strategy reduces the risk that other household members, if they are infected within the household, transmit in the community when pre-symptomatic (and hence before they self-isolate themselves) or if asymptomatic but still infectious.A blanket policy invoking a fixed duration of household isolation might cover the full epidemic in a small household. However, a larger household might present multiple generations of infection, potentially extending the within-household outbreak beyond the fixed duration of the household isolation policy. To address this issue, 'household quarantine' is another potential strategy. Upon detection of symptoms, the entire household is isolated until a fixed duration of time after the last symptomatic case within the household expresses symptoms.",

Given all infectious contacts outside lead to an actual infection because we are in the early phase of the epidemic and there is no depletion of susceptibles, each case infects, on average, R g new cases outside. Inside the household, a case would infect on average R h cases in an infinitely large household, but not all infectious contacts lead to real infections, given local saturation effects: in a household of size n, each infectious individual makes on average R h /(n \u2212 1) infectious contacts with each other specific individual throughout the infectious period, but only the first one will result in an infection, and only if the individual was susceptible at the time of contact.Each individual is given an indicator function of whether they are symptomatic or not (individuals show symptoms independently of each other with probability p s ) and a resilience threshold. This last quantity is drawn from an exponential distribution with mean 1, and represents the overall infection pressure this individual is able to withstand before they get infected. The infection pressure up to time \u03c4 is the integral from 0 to \u03c4 of the force-of-infection (FOI) applied to this individual coming from all infectious sources.At the beginning of the within-household epidemic, a single initial case is assumed. Time is discretised with a predefined time step dt = 0.1 days. At any time step, the current infectivity of all infectives in that time step is summed over, keeping track differently of the infectivity spread outside and inside the household. An overall measure of the accumulated infectivity within the household is updated at each time step and when this crosses the resilience threshold of a susceptible individual, they acquire the infection.",

At the end of the incubation period, a symptomatic individual starts showing symptoms, which allow the triggering of control policies (after the delay d d ). Asymptomatic individuals do not trigger any policy. After a latent period (defined as the incubation minus the prodromal period) and irrespective of symptoms, any infected case starts an infectious period with an infectivity that changes over time following the probability density function of a Gamma distribution (mean \u00b5 F = 2.2 and standard deviation \u03c3 F = 1.64 days). Asymptomatic cases are assumed half as infectious as symptomatic ones (relative infectivity f a = 0.5).SummaryUnder the baseline scenario control can in principle be achieved, but only for high levels of adherence, which might be difficult to enforce for a prolonged length of time. More importantly, the model's conclusions are highly sensitive to variations in parameter choices, which are uncertain. Parameters that present problems here are the delay from symptom onset to isolation (with control failing for 1 day detection delay unless adherence is essentially perfect), proportion of asymptomatic infections (any chance of control lost at 50%) and the strength of asymptomatic transmission. The short delay before symptomatic individuals isolate may be unrealistic unless the susceptible population is very well-informed about symptoms that call for isolation, and so likely does not apply in very early stages of an outbreak. Overall, in the face of the many uncertainties, household-based interventions triggered purely by symptoms appear useful to slow the spread but need to be complemented by other policies.",
