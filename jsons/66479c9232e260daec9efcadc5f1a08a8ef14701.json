Studies conducted in southern China found that bats carried a variety of viruses. However, few studies have been conducted on bats in northern China, which harbours a diversity of endemic insectivorous bats. It is important to understand the prevalence and diversity of viruses circulating in bats in northern China. In this study, a total of 145 insectivorous bats representing six species were collected from northern China and screened with degenerate primers for viruses belonging to six families, including coronaviruses, astro viruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses. Our study found that four of the viruses screened for were positive and the overall detection rates for astroviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses in bats were 21.4%, 15.9%, 20% and 37.2%, respectively. In addition, we found that bats in northern China harboured a diversity of novel viruses. Common Serotine (Eptesicus serotinu), Fringed long-footed Myotis (Myotis fimriatus) and Peking Myotis (Myotis pequinius) were investigated in China for the first time. Our study provided new information on the ecology and phylogeny of bat-borne viruses.",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are causative agents of severe human respiratory infections SARS and MERS and belong to the lineage B and lineage C of \u03b2-CoV, respectively (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012). Molecular analysis was based on the 440-bp RdRp gene sequence of coronaviruses, although it was proposed to extend the 440-bp RdRp fragment to 816 bp to obtain better phylogenetic resolution (Drexler et al., 2010). Despite the short sequences, we were able to identify diverse coronaviruses in bats in China. We documented two lineage C \u03b2-CoV genotypes in Fringed long-footed Myotis (M. fimbriatus) and Common Serotine (E. serotinus). So far, genotypes of lineage C \u03b2-CoV in bats have been reported in Common Serotine (E. serotinus), Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), Pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus spp.), Common noctule (Nyctalus noctula) and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii) in Italy (De Benedictis et al., 2014; Lelli et al., 2013), broad-eared bat (Nyctinomops laticaudatus) and Davy's naked-backed bat (Pteronotus davyi) in Mexico (Anthony et al., 2013; Goes et al., 2013), Zulu Pipistrelle bat (Neoromicia zuluensisin) in South Africa (Ithete et al., 2013), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus) in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013), Gambian Slit-faced bat (Nycteris gambiensis) in Ghana (Annan et al., 2013), Common",
