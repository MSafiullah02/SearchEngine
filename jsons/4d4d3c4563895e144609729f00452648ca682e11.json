            "text": "Since the fi rst documentation of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1 it has been used for an increasing and diverse number of applications, including mRNA expression studies, DNA copy number measurements in genomic or viral DNAs, 2-7 allelic discrimination assays, 8, 9 expression analysis of specifi c splice variants of genes [10] [11] [12] [13] and gene expression in paraffi n-embedded tissues, 14, 15 and laser captured microdissected cells. 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] Therefore, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) is now essential in molecular diagnostics to quantitatively assess the level of RNA or DNA in a given specimen. Q-RT-PCR enables the detection and quantifi cation of very small amounts of DNA, cDNA, or RNA, even down to a single copy. It is based on the detection of fl uorescence produced by reporter probes, which varies with reaction cycle number. Only during the exponential phase of the conventional PCR reaction is it possible to extrapolate back in order to determine the quantity of initial template sequence. The \"real-time\" nature of this technology pertains to the constant monitoring of fl uorescence from specially designed reporter probes during each cycle. Due to inhibitors of the polymerase reaction found with the template, reagent limitation or accumulation of pyrophosphate molecules, the PCR reaction eventually ceases to generate template at an exponential rate (i.e., the plateau phase), making the end point quantitation of PCR products unreliable in all but the exponential phase. Examples of fl uorescent reporter molecules include dyes that bind to the double-stranded DNA (i.e., SYBR\u00ae Green) or sequencespecifi c probes (i.e., TaqMan\u00ae products or Molecular Beacons Probes). The automation of the reaction as a whole has enabled Q-RT-PCR assays to be easy to perform with higher sensitivity and more specifi city.",

            "text": "Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is the reliable detection and measurement of products generated during each cycle of the PCR process, which are directly proportional to the amount of template prior to the start of the PCR process. Holland and co-workers 20 demonstrated that the thermostable enzyme Thermus aquaticus (i.e., Taq) DNA polymerase had 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity. This group also showed that cleavage of a specifi cally designed target probe during PCR by the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase can be used to detect amplifi cation of the amplifi ed product. 20 An oligonucleotide probe, which was designed to hybridize within the target sequence, was introduced into the PCR assay. This probe was labeled with 32 P at its 5\u2032 end and was nonextendable at its 3\u2032 end to ensure it could not act as a primer. Annealing of probe to one of the PCR product strands during the course of amplifi cation generated a substrate suitable for exonuclease activity. Also, during amplifi cation, the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase (when the enzyme extended from an upstream primer into the region of the probe) degraded the probe into smaller fragments that could be differentiated from undegraded probe. This dependence on polymerization ensured that cleavage of the probe occurred only if the target sequence was being amplifi ed. After PCR, cleavage of the probe was measured by using thinlayer chromatography to separate cleavage fragments from intact probe. The introduction of dual-labeled oligonucleotide fl uorogenic probes allowed the elimination of post-PCR processing for the analysis of probe degradation. 21 The probe has a reporter fl uorescent dye at the 5\u2032 end and a quencher dye attached to the 3\u2032 end. While the probe is intact, the close proximity of the quencher signifi cantly decreases the fl uorescence emitted by the reporter dye. A fl uorescence signal is only emitted on cleavage of the probe, based on the fl uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle. 22 In the real-time quantitative TaqMan\u00ae assay, a fl uorogenic nonextendable probe, termed the \"TaqMan\" probe, is used (Figure 8 .1). 23 The probe has a fl uorescent reporter dye attached to its 5\u2032 end and a quencher dye at its 3\u2032 terminus. If the target sequence is present, the fl uorogenic probe anneals downstream from one of the primer sites and is cleaved by the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase enzyme during the extension phase of the PCR. While the probe is intact, FRET occurs, and the fl uorescence emission of the reporter dye is absorbed by the quenching dye. Cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase during PCR separates the reporter and quencher dyes, thereby increasing the fl uorescence from the former. Additionally, cleavage removes the probe from the target strand, allowing primer extension to continue to the end of template strand, thereby not interfering with the exponential accumulation of PCR product. Additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes with each cycle, leading to an increase in fl uorescence intensity proportional to the amount of amplicon produced. The various available chemistries for real-time PCR are described later in this review.",

By default, the computer software sets the baseline from cycles three to 15; however, this often needs to be changed manually utilizing software supplied with each particular thermocycler. versus the cycle number. During the early cycles of PCR amplifi cation, \u2206Rn values do not exceed the baseline. \u2022 Threshold: An arbitrary threshold is chosen by the computers, based on the variability of the baseline. It is calculated as ten times the standard deviation of the average signal of the baseline fl uorescent signal between cycles three to 15. A fl uorescent signal that is detected above the threshold is considered a real signal that can be used to defi ne the threshold cycle (Ct) for a sample. If required, the threshold can be manually changed for each experiment so that it is in the region of exponential amplifi cation across all amplifi cation plots. \u2022 Ct: This is defi ned as the fractional PCR cycle number at which the reporter fl uorescence is greater than the minimal detection level (i.e., the threshold). The Ct is a basic principle of real-time PCR and is an essential component in producing accurate and reproducible data. 1 The presence of more template at the start of the reaction leads to a fewer number of cycles passing before reaching the point at which the fl uorescent signal is recorded as statistically signifi cant above background. 24 This Ct value will always occur during the exponential phase of target amplifi cation, which occurs during the early cycles of PCR. As reaction components become limiting, the rate of target amplifi cation decreases until the PCR reaction is no longer generating template at an exponential rate (plateau phase), and there is little or no increase in PCR product. This is the main reason why Ct is a more reliable measure of starting copy number than an endpoint measurement of the amount of accumulated PCR product. During the exponential phase, none of the reaction components is limiting, and therefore, Ct values are very reproducible for replicate reactions with the same starting copy number.",

            "text": "Standard-curve or absolute quantitation: As shown by Higuchi and co-workers, the plot of the log of initial target copy number for a set of known standards (fi ve-or tenfold serial dilution) versus Ct is a straight line (the standard curve). 1 Quantitation of the amount of target in the \"unknown\" samples of interest is accomplished by measuring Ct and using the standard curve to determine starting copy number. The most common source of a known sample is a plasmid for the gene of interest, and the standard curve is generated based on a serial dilution of a starting amount. Another option, and easier to generate if a plasmid is unavailable, is the use of a synthetic single-stranded sense oligonucleotide for the entire amplicon. The advantage of this approach is that it signifi cantly simplifi es the process of obtaining a standard curve for amplicons up to 100 bp, which encompasses most real-time PCR amplicons. Furthermore, it is also less susceptible to bias when quantifi ed by a spectrophotometer due to the relative purity of the oligonucleotide. Together with the greater precision of measurement of the standard and the possibility of calculating the moles of oligonucleotide (hence, number of copies); it is possible to approximate the number of copies of a template in an unknown sample, although not in terms of absolute copy number. One fi nal option for a standard curve is to use a cell line with a known copy number or expression level of the gene of interest. The standard curve method is used in circumstances when absolute quantitation is critical for the investigator (e.g., when measuring a small number of genes in either a few or many samples) 25, 26 or in quantitation of viral load. [27] [28] [29] Relative quantitation: Relative quantitation is also known as the comparative threshold method (2-Ct method). This method eliminates the need for standard curves, and mathematical equations are used to calculate the relative expression levels of a target relative to a reference control or calibrator, such as a nontreated sample or RNA from normal tissue. The amount of target, normalized to an endogenous housekeeping gene and relative to the calibrator, is then given by 2-Ct, where Ct = Ct (sample) \u2212 Ct (calibrator), and Ct is the Ct of the target gene subtracted from the Ct of the housekeeping gene. The equation thus represents the normalized expression of the target gene in the unknown sample, relative to the normalized expression of the calibrator sample. For this calculation to be valid and in order to obtain reliable results, it is imperative that the amplifi cation effi ciencies of the housekeeping and target gene are approximately equal and at or above 90%. This can be established by looking at how Ct (of both sample and calibrator) varies with template dilution. If the plot of complementary DNA (cDNA) dilution versus Ct is close to zero, it implies that the effi ciencies of the target and housekeeping genes are very similar. If a housekeeping gene cannot be found whose amplifi cation effi ciency is similar to the target, the standard curve method is then preferable. Alternatively, new primers can be designed and/or optimized to achieve a similar effi ciency for the target and housekeeping gene amplicons.",

In order to minimize these errors and correct for sample-to-sample variation, a cellular RNA is simultaneously amplifi ed with the target, which serves as an internal reference against which other RNA values can be normalized. The most common genes used for normalization, termed \"housekeeping\" genes, are \u03b2-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, and glceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a glycolytic enzyme, 30 and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These genes should theoretically be expressed at a constant level among different tissues of an organism, at all stages of development, and their expression levels should also remain relatively constant in different experimental conditions. However, none of these housekeeping genes are ideal. It has been shown that GAPDH expression levels are altered by glucose, insulin, heat shock, and cellular proliferation; and \u03b2-actin levels may also be modifi ed by experimental treatments. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] rRNA production is less likely to vary under conditions affecting mRNA transcription. 36, 37 However, it is not always a good representative of total mRNA population in a cell as rRNA is expressed at a much higher level than mRNA.",

SYBR Green I only fl uoresces when intercalated into dsDNA. The intensity of the fl uorescence signal is therefore dependent on the quantity of dsDNA present in the reaction.

            "text": "Double-stranded DNA-intercalating agents (DNA-binding dyes): SYBR Green I is a nonsequence-specifi c fl uorogenic minor groove DNA-binding dye that intercalates into dsDNA (it does not bind to single-stranded DNA). SYBR Green 1 exhibits little fl uorescence when unbound in solution but emits a strong fl uorescent signal upon binding to dsDNA. 39 An increase in the fl uorescence signal occurs during polymerization, and this decreases when DNA is denatured. Fluorescent measurements are performed at the end of the elongation step of each PCR cycle to monitor the increasing amount of amplifi ed DNA. The advantage of this technique is that it is relatively cheap, as it can be used with any pair of primers for any target. However, as the presence of any dsDNA generates fl uorescence, specifi city of this assay is greatly decreased due to amplifi cation of nonspecifi c PCR products and primer-dimers. 40 Generating and comparing melting curves (plotting fl uorescence as a function of temperature) using the LightCycler TM (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) (or RotorGene, Smart Cycler, iCycler, Mx4000) is one method of increasing the specifi city of the reaction. 40 A characteristic melting peak at the melting temperature TM of the amplicon will distinguish it from amplifi cation artifacts that melt at lower temperatures at broader peaks. It is possible to set the software to acquire fl uorescence above the primer-dimers' melting temperature but below that of the target. Another controllable problem is that longer amplicons create a stronger signal. Usually, SYBR Green is used in singleplex reactions; however, when coupled with melting-point analysis, it can be used for multiplex reactions. The SYBR Green I reaction has been used for many applications (e.g., viral load detection 41 and cytokine quantifaction. [42] [43] [44] Hydrolysis probes (e.g., TaqMan probes): This chemistry has already been outlined earlier in this review (Figure 8.1) . A forward and reverse primer and a probe are used. The effi ciency of the assay is mainly dependent on 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 nuclease activity; the most commonly used enzyme is Taq polymerase, 20 but any enzyme with 5\u2032 nuclease activity can be used. 45 The oligonucleotide probe has a covalently bonded fl uorescent reporter dye and quencher dye at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, respectively. Various fl uorescent reporter dyes are in use including 6-carboxyfl uorescein (FAM), tetrachloro-6-carboxyfl uorescein (TET), hexacholoro-6-carboxyfl uorescein (HEX), or VIC. Quenchers include either 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) or 4-(dimethylaminoazo) benzene-4-carboxylic acid (DABCYL). When the probe is intact, the proximity of the reporter and quencher dyes permits FRET, and fl uorescence emission does not occur. During PCR amplifi cation, the probe anneals to the target, and Taq polymerase cleaves the probe, allowing an increase in fl uorescence emission. The increase in fl uorescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of amplicon produced. The TaqMan chemistry is the most widely used real-time PCR assay and has been used for multiple purposes. 32, 46, 47 TaqMan minor groove-binding probes have more recently been developed. In this chemistry, the standard TAMRA quencher at the 3\u2032 end is replaced by a nonfl uorescent quencher, and a minor groove-binder molecule is also incorporated at the 3\u2032 terminus. The latter stabilizes the probe-target complex by folding into the minor groove of the dsDNA. Additionally, the Tm of the probes is increased, allowing the use of very short oligoprobes (14 nucleotides in length) and providing more accurate allelic discrimination. Thus, TaqMan minor groove-binding probes are ideal for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms 48, 49 and for the quantitative analysis of methylated alleles. 50 Dual hybridization probes: This method has been convincingly validated in studies using the LightCycler instrument. Two hybridization probes are used-one carries a donor fl uorophore at its 3\u2032 end, and the other is labeled with an acceptor fl uorophore at its 5\u2032 end. After the denaturation step, both probes hybridize to their target sequence in a head-to-tail arrangement during the annealing step. This brings the two dyes in close proximity, allowing FRET. The donor dye in one of the probes transfers energy, allowing the other one to dissipate fl uorescence at a different wavelength. The measured fl uorescence is directly proportional to the amount of DNA synthesized during the PCR reaction. The specifi city of this reaction is therefore increased as a fl uo-rescent signal is only detected when two independent probes hybridize to their correct target sequence. This method has been widely used for detection of minimal residual disease after therapy 51, 52 and viral load quantifi cation. 53, 54 Molecular beacons: Molecular beacons also contain covalently bound fl uorescent and quenching dyes at either end of a single-stranded DNA molecule. However, they are also designed to adopt a hairpin or stem-and-loop structure while free in solution to bring the fl uorescent dye and the quencher in close proximity for FRET to occur. 55 The loop portion of the molecule is complementary to the target nucleic acid molecule, and the stem is formed by the annealing of complementary arm sequences on the ends of the probe sequence. The close proximity of the fl uorophore and the quencher in this hairpin confi guration suppresses reporter fl uorescence. When the probe sequence in the loop hybridizes to a complementary nucleic acid target sequence during the annealing step, a conformational change occurs that forces the stem apart. This results in a linear structure and thus separation of the fl uorophore from the quencher dye (FRET does not occur) and an increase in fl uorescence emission. A new hybridization takes place in the annealing step of each cycle, and the intensity of the resultant fl uorescence indicates the amount of accumulated amplicon at the end of the previous cycle. Molecular beacons remain intact during PCR, and they must rehybridize to the target sequence each cycle for fl uorescence emission. Molecular beacons are especially suitable for identifying point mutations. [56] [57] [58] Scorpions: Similar to molecular beacons, scorpions adopt a stem-and-loop confi guration with a 5\u2032 fl uorophore and 3\u2032 quencher. The specifi c probe sequence is held within the hairpin loop, which is attached to the 5\u2032 terminus of a PCR primer sequence by a nonamplifi able monomer (termed the PCR stopper). This chemical modifi cation prevents PCR from copying the stem-loop sequence of the scorpion primer. During PCR, scorpion primers are extended to form amplicon. In the annealing phase, the specifi c probe sequence in the scorpion tail curls back to hybridize to the complementary target sequence in the amplicon, thus opening up the hairpin loop. This prevents the fl uorescence from being quenched, and a signal is observed. 59 As the tail of the scorpion and the amplicon are now part of the same strand of DNA, the interaction is intramolecular.",

This contrasts to the bimolecular collisions required by other technologies such as TaqMan or molecular beacons. The benefi ts of a unimolecular rearrangement are signifi cant in that the reaction is effectively instantaneous and the fl uorescence signal much stronger. Also better discrimination and specifi city are achieved using scorpions. Scorpion probes have been used for viral load and mutation detection. 60, 61 Duplex scorpions are a modifi cation of scorpions. However, in contrast to scorpions (or molecular beacons), the fl uorophore and quencher dye is separated onto different and complementary oligonucleotides. The advantage of duplex scorpions is the signifi cantly greater separation between the quencher and reporter fl uorophore, which decreases fl uorophore quenching when the probe is bound to the target, resulting in better signal intensity compared with conventional scorpions. 62",

Primers, probes, and amplicons are designed to very exacting specifi cations, and the TaqMan system provides its own primer/probe design software from Applied Biosystems known as Primer Express, which is one of the most widely used oligonucleotide design programs for developing real-time quantitative PCR assays. Primer3, a free program from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MA, USA), can also be used to generate good real-time PCR assays, including designs incorporating an internal hybridization probe. The amplicon for the PCR product should be as small as reasonably possible, usually 50-150 bp in length for designs using hybridization probes (and less than 300 bp for SYBR Green assays). Shorter amplicons amplify more effi ciently and are more tolerant of reaction conditions. The optimal length for single-stranded primers is 15-20 bases with a G/C content of 20%-80%. Their Tm should be in the range of 68\u00b0C-70\u00b0C for TaqMan primers. Molecular beacon and hybridization probe-associated primers can have a wider range of Tm, but the Tm of any one pair should be similar (i.e., not differ by more than 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C). Nonspecifi c priming is minimized by selecting primers that have only one or two G/Cs within the last fi ve nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end. If using a SYBR Green I approach, the PCR primers must not form an appreciable amount of primer-dimer bands. A melting curve analysis of each product is needed to ensure that the fl uorescent signal observed is from the desired PCR product. In mRNA expression assays using a hybridization probe, the probe sequence should span an exon/exon boundary if possible. Having the probe Tm 8\u00b0C-10\u00b0C higher than that of the primers ensures that the probe is fully hybridized during primer extension. TaqMan probes should not contain a G at their 5\u2032 ends due to the quenching effect of a G in this position on reporter fl uorescence, even after probe cleavage.",

            "text": "The term multiplex Q-RT-PCR is used to describe the use of multiple fl uorogenic probes for the discrimination of multiple amplicons in a single tube. The main advantages of multiplexing over single-target analysis are the ability to provide internal controls, lower reagent costs and preservation of precious low quantity samples. The main restrictions of this technique have been the limited number of available fl uorophores, fl uorescence emission from quenching dyes, and the common use in real-time instruments of a monochromatic light source. The introduction of nonfl uorescent quenchers, which have no inherent fl uorescence, has been a breakthrough that has allowed an increase in the number of spectrally discernable fl uorogenic probes used per reaction. Initial Q-RT-PCR instrumentation contained optimized fi lters to minimize overlap of the emission spectra from the fl uorophores. Newer systems have used either multiple light-emitting diodes, which span the whole visible spectrum, or a tungsten lamp, which emits light over a broad range of wavelengths. However, despite these advancements, only four-color multiplex reactions are usually possible, 63, 64 of which one color may be used for an internal control. One recent development is the introduction of combinatorial fl uorescence energy transfer tags, 65, 66 which will help to boost the development of multiplex real-time PCR.",
