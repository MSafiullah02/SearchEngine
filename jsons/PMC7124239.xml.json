Without sufficient knowledge of the SARS-CoV at present, it is quite difficult to define the potential targets in SARS-CoV for anti-SARS drugs. To solve this problem, several approaches, such as the determination of binding sites in SARS-CoV [6], the alignment and multiple comparison among protein data bank with Blastp and other computer software [5], [11], the prediction of mutation sites in spike protein from SARS-CoV [35], have been taken to analyze the potential targets in SARS-CoV.",

The structural proteins from SARS-CoV can be primarily considered the potential targets [1], because their functions are comparatively clear. Currently, we are attracted by five structural proteins from SARS-CoV, i.e. the replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. These proteins are similar to other coronaviruses in function. The replicase polyprotein is a multifunctional protein containing the activities necessary for the transcription of negative stranded RNA, leader RNA, subgenomic mRNAs and progeny virion RNA as well as proteinases responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein into functional products. The spike protein is responsible for binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion. The envelope and membrane glycoproteins are components of the viral envelope that plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via their interactions with other viral proteins. The nucleocapsid protein is the major structural component of virons that associates with genomic RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid [4], [7], [10], [14], [15].",

We could expect that the anti-SARS drugs have a greater chance to interact with SARS-CoV if the collision between anti-SARS drugs and structural proteins in SARS-CoV is a random event [28]. This being the case, there are two problems: (i) a single amino acid from abundant groups does not directly represent the functional groups in proteins, because a good signature pattern of a protein must be as short as possible, but the conserved sequence is not longer than four or five residues [13]; and (ii) even if these amino acids would be located at the functional sites, there is still a chance of mutation at these amino acids leading to the inefficacy of anti-SARS drugs [17].",

Over the last few years we have developed three models using random approaches to analyze the functional amino acid pairs in proteins and to evaluate the mutation effects on amino acid pairs [30]. Generally, in terms of actual and predicted frequencies, our models classify the amino acid pairs in a protein into two categories: the randomly predictable and the unpredictable. First, our models suggest that the amino acid pairs with large differences between actual and predicted frequencies should be deliberately developed and probably be located at the functional sites, as the random construction of an amino acid pair is the least time- and energy-consuming. For the functional purpose, nature should have the intention to spend more time and energy to construct amino acid pairs with large differences between actual and predicted frequencies [24], [25], [26], [29]. Second, our models reveal that the mutations are likely to occur at the amino acid pairs, whose actual frequency is larger than their predicted frequency [31], [32], [33], [34]. Finally, our models demonstrate that the amino acid pairs with high Markov transition probability are less sensitive to mutations [21], [22], [23], [27].",

The Markov transition probability calculates the probability from one state to another state [18]. For an amino acid pair, an amino acid has a certain probability to follow a certain preceding amino acid, which constructs a conditional probability (the first-order Markov chain), i.e. the probability of an amino acid occurs in an amino acid pair given a certain first amino acid [P(second amino acid|first amino acid)]. The calculation of this probability is the transition from the state of one amino acid to the state of an amino acid pair. More practically, in the case of the English language, the first-order Markov chain analyzes the probability, for example, that the \u201ce\u201d follows \u201cw\u201d from 26 available letters. Once again we use the spike protein as an example, there are 39 \u201cR\u201ds and 39 \u201cC\u201ds in this protein. Intuitively either \u201cR\u201d or \u201cC\u201d would have the same probability to follow \u201cN\u201d, actually the Markov transition probability shows that the \u201cC\u201d has a bigger probability to follow \u201cN\u201d rather than \u201cR\u201d, so the amino acid pair \u201cNC\u201d is more stable and less sensitive to mutations than \u201cNR\u201d.",

Generally each of the 20 types of amino acids has a chance of 1/20 (P=0.05) to repeat once, and an amino acid pair has a chance of 1/400 (P=0.0025) to repeat once in the protein primary structure. In case of the spike protein from human SARS-CoV, there are 99 threonines (T) and 99 leucines (L), the most abundant amino acids, and 11 tryptophans (\u201cW\u201ds), the least amino acid. If the first amino acid is \u201cT\u201d, then the chance of the second amino acid being \u201cT\u201d is 98/1254 (P=0.078>0.05). If the first amino acid is \u201cW\u201d, then the chance of the second amino acid being \u201cW\u201d is 10/1254 (P=0.008<0.01). Accordingly the chance of the first amino acid pair being \u201cTT\u201d is (99/1255)\u00d7(98/1254) (P=0.0062<0.01), and the chance of the second amino acid pair being \u201cTT\u201d is (97/1253)\u00d7(96/1252) (P=0.0059<0.01). For the least frequent amino acid \u201cW\u201d, the chance of first amino acid pair of \u201cWW\u201d is (11/1255)\u00d7(10/1254) (P=0.00007<0.001), and the chance of second amino acid pair of \u201cWW\u201d is (9/1253)\u00d7(8/1252) (P=0.00005<0.001). For that reason, the probability is <0.05 if the difference between any amino acid pairs is greater than or equal to one.
