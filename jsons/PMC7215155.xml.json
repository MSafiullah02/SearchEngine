In particular, the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has an ability to exert substantial severe disease and mortality burden especially affecting individuals older than 60 years and those with prior health conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes (Adler, 2020; Team, 2020). As of April 15th, 2020, the trajectory of the pandemic varies significantly around the world ranging from relatively well contained outbreaks in Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong to explosive epidemics characterized by initial exponential growth periods in a few hotspots located in various countries around the world including the United States, Italy, Spain, UK, France, and Iran (Ebbs, 2020; Griffiths, 2020; Minder, 2020).",

To respond to the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the government shuttered schools on March 11th, 2020. The next day, the government banned gatherings of more than 300 people and suspended all international flights from Europe and Asia. On March 16th, 2020, the government declared a national emergency and closed country borders (Explorer, 2020). Subsequently, on March 17th, 2020 the president of Peru announced the beginning of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, and ordered a curfew in the region on March 18th, 2020 to avoid night time socializing to prevent disease transmission (Explorer, 2020; Writing, 2020).",

Estimates of the effective R indicate if the disease transmission sustains (R > 1) or the disease trend is declining (R < 1). Therefore, it is necessary to maintain R < 1 to contain an outbreak. Here, we estimate the reproduction number by characterizing the early growth phase (16 day) of local cases using the generalized-growth model (Viboud et al., 2016) and modeling the generation interval of SARS-CoV-2 assuming a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days (Nishiura, Linton, & Akhmetzhanov, 2020; You et al., 2020).

We perform a sensitivity analyses by setting \u03b1=0.15  and \u03b1=1.0 to assess the relative contribution of imported cases to the secondary disease transmission (Nishiura & Roberts, 2010). This is followed by the derivation of the uncertainty bounds around the curve of R directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates (r, p). We estimate R for 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure (Chowell, 2017).

In comparison countries like New Zealand, South Korea and Australia have tested widely and exhibit lower positivity rates (2%) whereas Italy and the US have shown much higher positivity rates (15\u201320%) for COVID-19 indicating suboptimal testing capacity in these countries (Meyer & C.Madrigal, 2020; Project, 2020). A recent study has shown that changes in testing rates over the course of the epidemic can mask the epidemic growth rate resulting in biased epidemic trends (Omori, Mizumoto, & Chowell, 2020). Moreover, there is a substantial fraction of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, which could have underestimated the reproduction number derived from the daily incidence's growth trend of symptomatic cases (Mizumoto et al., 2020, Mizumoto et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020). Our study underscores the need for active contact tracing efforts that targets symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, rapid isolation of infectious individuals, quarantined contacts and strict social distancing measures to curb the spread of the virus.",

Blue circles correspond to the data points, the red solid line indicates the model's mean fit and the red dashed lines represent the 95% prediction interval. The vertical black dashed line represents the time of the start of the forecast period. The forecast (March 16th- March 30th) suggests that social distancing interventions have slowed down the transmission rate.
