The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Central China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 20192020 coronavirus pandemic. On March 16th, 2020, researchers and leaders from the Allen Institute for AI, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), Microsoft, and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health released the 1 of scholarly literature about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the coronavirus group. Traditional search engines for life sciences (e.g., PubMed) are designed for document retrieval and do not allow direct retrieval of specific statements. Some of these statements may serve as textual evidence that is key to tasks such as hypothesis generation and new finding validation. We created EVI-DENCEMINER (Wang et al., 2020a) , a web-based system for textual evidence discovery for life sciences. We apply the EVIDENCEMINER system to the CORD-19 corpus to facilitate textual evidence mining for the COVID-19 studies 2 . Given a query as a natural language statement, EVIDENCEMINER automatically retrieves sentence-level textual evidence from the CORD-19 corpus. In the following sections, we introduce the details of the EVI-DENCEMINER system. We also show some textual evidence retrieval results with EVIDENCEMINER on the CORD-19 corpus.",

In the top-retrieved results, we see many supporting sentences such as the top one Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation represents an alternative to chemical inactivation methods. More interestingly, we found the fifth sentence Whole UV-inactivated SARS-CoV (UV-V), bearing multiple epitopes and proteins, is a candidate vaccine against this virus indicating that UV-inactivation also has the potential for vaccine development against the virus. Scientists are very interested in this result that inspired them to conduct UV-related COVID-19 vaccine development.",

For example, some statements support the use of masks to prevent the virus, such as COVID-19 is transmitted by saliva droplets, , which can be prevented by wearing masks. While other statements are against the effectiveness of wearing masks, such as Although surgical masks are in widespread use , there is no evidence that wearing these masks can prevent the acquisition of COVID-19 .
