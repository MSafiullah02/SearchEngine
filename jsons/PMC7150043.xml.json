This is especially true in developing countries, where poverty limits those who can afford health care. Given the large quantity of research undertaken on vaccine development over a long period time (centuries), it is somewhat surprising that only a total of 31 vaccines are in use today. This is in part due to the long and complex road to the development of a vaccine. There are expectations not only that a vaccine will give long-term protective immunity from the infectious disease but also that it will be 100% safe, such that any side-effects due to immunization are unacceptable. Given these expectations, at the present time the process of vaccine development from discovery to licensure takes 18\u201320 years, and consequently is very expensive at approximately US$ 500 million. In this chapter the routine immunization schedules and travelers\u2019 vaccines will be outlined, and how vaccines are implemented in the tropics is followed by a description of the vaccine development pathway and a discussion of vaccines in development.",

This information is frequently updated as new vaccines become available, and detailed information on all vaccines is available.1 Many of the vaccines recommended by the WHO are the same as those used in developed countries, such as the United States,2 but there are some differences. For example, the WHO recommends BCG vaccine (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin is a live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis) for all children after birth and the live attenuated poliomyelitis vaccine for all children, but does not recommend the live attenuated chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, whereas the United States does not recommend BCG vaccine, utilizes the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine, and has incorporated the varicella vaccine into the routine childhood immunization schedule.",

Examples would be yellow fever where the disease is found in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa but not Asia, whereas Japanese encephalitis is found in Asia but not Africa or South America. The objective is to aid decision-making of the most advantageous immunization schedules for health care providers in each region/country to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and maintain lifelong immunity. In this situation health care providers include not only those who are responsible for administering the vaccine but also national decision-makers, immunization managers, regulatory authorities, and Ministers of Health. This process is not only important for public health officials but also it helps vaccine producers evaluate potential markets.",

The WHO estimates that at any one time more than 500 000 persons are in aircraft. Travel vaccine portfolios are an important component for most vaccine producers, and travel medicine clinics are equally important as sites to provide the appropriate vaccines for travelers (see Chapter 126). The emphasis is on appropriate vaccines as it is important that individuals only receive vaccines for which there is demonstrable risk of the traveler being exposed to the natural disease. For example, individuals visiting Peru would want to receive yellow fever vaccine if they were visiting the jungle areas of Peru but would not want to receive the vaccine if they were visiting Lima, the capital of Peru, as this city is on the coast where the mosquito vectors that transmit the virus are not found. Similarly, intracountry travelers need to be considered for vaccination when they travel to different regions of a country. Public health agencies such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a website that is continually updated on recommendations of vaccines for travelers to different regions of the world.3\n",

Nonetheless, technologic advances and increasing knowledge about vaccines have led to investigations focused on the safety of current vaccines, which has an ever-increasingly important role on public confidence in immunization. While great efforts have been made in producing vaccines, they have little use if the target population will not have confidence to receive the vaccine. As a consequence, it is essential that concerns regarding vaccine-related adverse events are rapidly and effectively addressed in order to maintain confidence in a vaccine, and ultimately maintain immunization coverage and reduce disease incidence. Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. In particular, serious adverse events are the major concern. These are defined by the US Food and Drug Administration as adverse events involving death, life-threatening condition, hospitalization (initial or prolonged), disability, or congenital anomaly, or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. It was in this background that the WHO established the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) in 1999 to respond promptly, efficiently, and with scientific thoroughness to vaccine safety issues of potential global importance. The GACVS meets twice a year and publishes its discussions/recommendations in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record.",

It is significant that many of the vaccines that are used today are due to discoveries made in universities (e.g., poliomyelitis, measles, and yellow fever) that were subsequently exploited by industry to produce the vaccine. Nearly all the current live attenuated vaccines were generated empirically before the advent of NRAs, and it is unlikely that many of the current vaccines we take for granted (e.g., smallpox, yellow fever, and BCG) would be approved in the modern era. Where it was not possible to generate live attenuated vaccines, the logical alternative was to take the wild-type organism and chemically inactivate it, and use it as a killed vaccine. While this process has been important in the development of vaccines against some important infectious diseases, killed vaccines suffer from the limitation that booster immunizations are required to maintain a protective immune response. The development of \u201cgenetic engineering\u201d techniques revolutionized vaccine development, and the first recombinant subunit vaccine was the hepatitis B vaccine where the surface antigen (HBsAg) was expressed in yeast. Subsequently, many candidate vaccines have been developed or are in development using genetic engineering techniques, and these are described in detail for specific pathogens in the relevant chapters of this book.",

Clearly, development of a small-animal model that resembles the disease seen in humans is very important.

This is somewhat easier for killed and subunit products than live vaccines where the attenuated phenotype has to be carefully documented and the potential of reversion thoroughly investigated.

Nonclinical safety assessment includes tests to determine the direct toxicity of the candidate vaccine and other components of the formulation, the lack of contaminants, impurities, and adventitious agents, and the potential of the vaccine directly or indirectly to trigger other preexisting conditions.14 In general, vaccine toxicology is assessed in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in two mammalian species, typically one rodent and one nonrodent (often a nonhuman primate). The vaccine is usually given by the route of administration planned for clinical use and tested at the maximum proposed human dose. The repeat-dose studies typically include one dose more than anticipated for use in humans. The repeat-dose studies are aimed at determining a dose where no adverse effect is observed. The toxicology assessments generally include mortality, clinical signs, food consumption, body weight, temperature, clinical chemistry, hematology, gross pathology, and histopathology. Depending on the constituents of the candidate vaccine, other specific tests may be required, such as potential of a live viral vaccine to establish a persistent infection, a DNA vaccine to integrate into the host genome, or additional genetic and reproductive toxicology studies for vaccines that will potentially be administered to pregnant women.15 Recent years have seen the development of new vaccine platforms, novel adjuvant systems, and unique delivery systems, and it is very likely that expanded safety testing will be required that is appropriate for the constituents and technology.16 As one would expect, the more detailed the studies, the longer it takes for a vaccine to reach licensure, and this explains in part the ever-increasing timeline for the vaccine development pathway.",

They involve investigations of the ability of the candidate vaccine to induce humoral and/or cellular immune responses, and the innate immune response, in relevant animal models. In an ideal situation, a vaccine immunogen will stimulate both neutralizing antibodies and a cell-mediated immune response that will stimulate long-term memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. With preclinical immunogenicity studies the aim is to demonstrate a protective immune response in an animal model that can be translated to a protective immune response in humans, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We often know a lot about the immune response induced by vaccine immunogens in common small-animal models, such as mice, but this is currently not matched by our knowledge in humans, and in some situations the mouse immune response is not representative of that seen in humans. However, recent years have seen a substantial move from obtaining data in small-animal models to equivalent studies in higher animals and humans.17 Although these studies are very important in early preclinical development of a vaccine candidate, most are not undertaken under good laboratory practices or a comparable quality system and therefore have limited use for preclinical development towards licensure. Ultimately, the studies on the protective immune response will lead to the development of correlate(s) of protection. While the immune response is complex and many different parameters are measured, a correlate of protection has to be assessable by uniform assays.

The first studies, referred to as phase I trials, are safety and immunogenicity studies performed in a small number of closely monitored healthy volunteers, normally young adults. These are generally short-term studies that may examine a range of vaccine dosages. The study design may be uncontrolled open-label or more often are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. Inclusion of a placebo group is important in assessing adverse events that may occur during the trial. As stated above, there is an expectation that all vaccines will be 100% safe with no adverse events associated with immunization. Phase I clinical trials follow a similar approach for nearly all vaccines. Phase II studies involve larger numbers of healthy volunteers, possibly volunteers at risk for the target disease. The design may examine optimum dosage and dosing regimen and focus on safety and immunogenicity, and some efficacy data may be collected. These larger sample sizes provide greater power to detect less common adverse events. Phase II trials are randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled. Phase III trials may enroll hundreds to thousands of individuals depending on the prevalence of the target disease. Generally thousands of volunteers are included in phase III trials in order to assess for rare adverse events. The phase III trials must be randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. For tropical diseases, the ability to undertake efficacy studies depends on the prevalence of the disease and the capacity to have strong epidemiologic data on incidence in areas where clinical trials will be undertaken. For some diseases, such as diarrheal diseases, this is relatively straightforward, while for other diseases, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, this is more difficult as the disease does not occur reproducibly over periods of time, the geographic location varies, and the relative numbers of cases are small.",

Because the safety of a vaccine may not be apparent until it is used widely in the population, approval of the new product may be contingent upon undertaking postmarketing studies, also referred to as phase IV studies. It should be noted that, in the United States, phase III clinical studies to provide data on safety in a statistically significant population size need to be completed before the application for a BLA, whereas, in Europe, phase III studies may be undertaken after the vaccine has been approved as postmarketing safety studies.",

The emphasis is often on consistency such that every lot of vaccine meets the same standards. The NCLs provide vaccine reference preparations, including antigen and antibody standards and other materials, for ensuring consistency in vaccines. These standards normally have defined biological activity expressed in international units so that vaccines manufactured by different producers in different countries can be compared and standardized.

Due to the expanding global nature of the vaccine industry, multiple NRAs and rules present increasing challenges to the development and implementation of new vaccines. To address this growing problem, regulatory agencies and manufacturers in the United States, Europe, and Japan established the International Conference on Harmonization.19 This is complemented by the WHO, which has the Global Training Network on Vaccine Quality that was established in 1996 with the aim of improving vaccine quality practices. In addition, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization consults and provides consensus views on important regulatory issues and provides guidance documents for use by NRAs and industry. These are published as Technical Report Series.20 Another important consideration is that vaccines for tropical diseases require clinical trials to be undertaken in countries where the diseases are found while the vaccine may be manufactured in a different country. Thus, each NRA has a critical role in vaccine development. With this in mind, the Developing Countries Vaccine Regulators Network has been established to share the experiences of multiple countries and facilitate licensure of vaccines.",
