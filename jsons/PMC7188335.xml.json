            "text": "One of the key statistics for monitoring a newly emerging disease is the fatality rate. Traditionally, the fatality rate is assumed to be constant throughout the epidemic, and is generally estimated as the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of cases. It is well known that this estimator is insensitive to changes in fatality over the course of the epidemic (Last, 1995). Studies have shown that this traditional estimator has underestimated the fatality of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) considerably especially in the early part of the epidemic (Yip, Lam, et al., 2005; Yip, Lau, et al., 2005). The consequence of this underestimation could be very serious because the implementation of suitable preventive measures at the early stage of an outbreak may heavily depend on the estimated fatality rate. Moreover, the fatality rate of a newly emerging epidemic may vary over time possibly due to improvement in clinical treatments and hospital management. Sometimes, changes in weather or environmental conditions over the course of the epidemic may also have an effect on the fatality. It is important to keep track of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemic so that the effectiveness of any implemented health policy or clinical treatment can be assessed and evaluated. The estimator for the time\u2010varying fatality rate via a counting process and kernel function was proposed in Yip, Lam, et al. (2005). An estimator derived from the chain multinomial model was considered by Yip, Lau, et al. (2005).",

Due to the urgency in an outbreak of an epidemic, effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible time are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum. Hence, a desirable property of the test is the ability to reject the null hypothesis as soon as we have enough evidence of a decreasing fatality as information accumulates over time. This property is particularly important in practice when combating a newly emerging disease. For example, the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, clinical management, or prognosis for the SARS epidemic were almost unknown to clinicians. Therefore, appropriate and effective interventions should be undertaken at the earliest possible time during the outbreak or else any delayed effort will result in less impact in controlling the epidemic. In this situation, the ability to extract the most information out of the data available is critical for making a focused and effective decision. Therefore, it is desirable if we can reject the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate at the earliest possible time during the outbreak of the epidemic.",

In the SARS epidemic in 2003, it was suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) that simple methods for calculating case\u2010fatality ratios from aggregate data will not give reliable estimates during the course of an epidemic (WHO, 2003). This statement is not entirely true. In the case of a constant fatality rate, a simple estimator based on the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the sum of the cumulative numbers of deaths and recoveries is shown to be its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This estimator is demonstrated to be more efficient in Section 3 and is more preferred if the assumption of constant fatality is valid. If the fatality rate is known to vary over time, a real\u2010time fatality rate estimator should be used (Yip, Lam, et al., 2005; Yip, Lau, et al., 2005), which was shown to be able to capture the changes and to monitor the fatality rate in a timely manner.",

When an individual is infected, he/she will be admitted to and treated in a hospital some time after the incubation period, usually longer at the beginning of the epidemic and shorter after the epidemic has taken off when the community is more aware of the disease. Inpatients are assumed to either die at a rate of \u03b31(t) or recover at a rate of \u03b32(t) on day t, where t is the calendar time since the beginning of the epidemic rather than the time since individual onset as in traditional survival analysis. By focusing on the calendar time instead of the survival time, we gain more insight in the trend of the fatality rate at the population level over the course of the epidemic. The population real time or time\u2010varying fatality rate is defined as\n(1)\nwhich can be viewed as the conditional probability of death given that an event of death or recovery occurs at time t. This fatality rate is a measure of the combined effect of the processes of death and recovery which is similar to the setting of the competing risks model (Yip and Lam, 1992; Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002, Chapter 7).",

In such situations, we propose to randomly impute the death and discharge (recovery) times within the day, or simply impute the order of deaths and discharges on that day because the test statistic only requires the order of occurrences of the events rather than the exact time to occurrences of the events. Also, we assume that all inpatients enter the system at the beginning of each day.

This mimics the practical situation that only the daily counts are available. Because only the death and recovery processes but not the infection process determine the test statistic, simulating the infection times is unnecessary while our focus is on the fatality rate. Therefore, we simply make use of the observed daily number of inpatients as in Hong Kong SARS epidemic in the simulation. The daily numbers of deaths and recoveries are simulated according to a multinomial distribution with probabilities q1(t) and q\n2(t) on day t, respectively. The value of \u03c4 is assumed to be 60 days, and the overall level of significance is set at \u03b1= 0.05 throughout. In each set of simulations, 10,000 data sets are generated and the proportion of data sets with the null hypothesis being rejected is the empirical size or power.

The simulation results are tabulated in Table 2. It is obvious that the empirical powers are very high (over 90%) in general unless the decrement in the fatality rate is extremely slow like the last case of scenario (C). From the results based on scenario (A), we may conclude that the test is extremely sensitive to the changes in the fatality rate and the null hypothesis may be rejected as early as within a week since the sudden drop in the fatality rate on the average. The column 1 \u2212\u03c0(\u03c4)/\u03c0(0) represents the relative decrement in the fatality rate from the start to time \u03c4 or the end of the epidemic. The power of the test increases with the relative decrement. Moreover the empirical powers remain to be quite high in general even when the relative decrement is only around 20%. Considering all scenarios, the proposed test statistic seems to be very powerful in general, and is sensitive enough to pick up various forms of changes in the fatality rate. Therefore, the performance of the proposed test is very satisfactory and will be useful to monitor the fatality rate of a newly emerging disease.",

When an effective new treatment or an intervention policy is implemented, it should cause a marked drop in the fatality rate. By formulating a model with time\u2010varying fatality rate, the proposed test is a useful tool to justify or to evaluate the effectiveness of the adopted health policies and/or the clinical management. A main advantage of this test is that as information accumulates over time, we are able to reject the null hypothesis as soon as there is enough evidence of decreasing fatality over time. Hence, more effective intervention measures can be launched in place to reduce fatality.",

The performance of the test statistic V\nn(\u03c4) is also studied in a simulation study not reported here. The performance is very similar to the one proposed, but the shortcoming of the test V\nn(\u03c4) is that it is evaluated at a prespecified time \u03c4, but we are not able to reject H\n0 before time \u03c4 even though there exhibits strong statistical evidence. However, this could also be the merit in some other applications. Modification of the proposed sequential tests can be made easily by using different times of interim analysis, say by making a comparison every three days instead of every day. This version has the advantage that the environmental and weather conditions will be more homogeneous within each period under consideration so that some uncontrollable variation can be grouped together or marginalized as the fatality rate may also be affected by the temperature or humidity. More work needs to be done to explore the feasibility of the modified test in practice.",

In the case of an outbreak due to human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, the proposed test will then be an extremely useful tool to provide a formal statistical method to test the hypothesis of decreasing fatality presumably due to some effective interventions in a sense that the alternative hypothesis can be accepted as soon as there is enough statistical evidence so that prompt and decisive action can be taken more effectively to suppress the fatality at the earliest time. A delay in the implementation of some effective intervention may result in more life loss globally. Nevertheless, we hope this test will never be used in practice.",
