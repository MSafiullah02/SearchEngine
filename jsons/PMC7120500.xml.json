            "text": "Viral infections are important as causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Severe viral infections are more common after unrelated and mismatched donor SCT and in particular after haploidentical SCT. B-cell function and specific antibodies are the main defense mechanisms against infection with exogenous viruses, thus reducing the risk for reinfection in already seropositive individuals. On the other hand, T-cell function in particular cytotoxic T-cell function is the main mechanism for preventing severe viral disease and also for the control of viruses such as herpesviruses that can cause latency and thus reactivate in an immunocompromised individual. The immune defects in SCT-patients are frequently complex with defects in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, helper T-lymphocyte, NK-cell, and B-lymphocyte functions. T-cell dysfunction is usually most important early after SCT while deficient B-cell reconstitution can remain for many years after SCT. Furthermore, since loss of specific antibodies occurs frequently over time after allogeneic SCT, this will also increase the risk for reinfections with previously encountered viruses such as measles or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and allow reactivation of viruses controlled by antibodies such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2].",

During recent years, important advances have been made through the use of rapid nucleic acid testing improving sensitivity and thereby making specific diagnosis and monitoring of viral infections feasible. The most commonly used technique is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) especially when used for determining viral load. Other techniques such as the hybrid capture assay, NASBA or branched-DNA have been applied and have shown good sensitivity and high specificity. The source of the specimen, the timing of collection in relation to onset of symptoms, the rapidity and method of delivery to the laboratory, and the clinical and epidemiological data provided to the laboratory are important factors that directly affect the likelihood of successful isolation and/or identification of a viral pathogen.\n",

CMV can cause multi-organ disease after SCT including pneumonia, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, retinitis, and encephalitis. CMV disease can occur both early and late after transplantation [3-6]. Seropositivity of the patients remains a risk factor for transplant related mortality in unrelated transplant patients despite major advances in early diagnosis and management [7-9] Seronegative patients with seropositive stem cell donors develop primary CMV infection in about 30% and have an increased mortality in bacterial and fungal infections [10]. In a study using the EBMT registry database, CMV seropositive patients receiving seropositive unrelated donor grafts had improved survival and reduced TRM compared to those receiving seronegative grafts and a similar result was found in a single center study [11, 12]. The mechanism for this positive effect was hypothesized to be the transfer of CMV-specific donor cells with the grafts. Other studies have, however, failed to find this correlation and therefore, it remains controversial [13]. Other identified risk factors include acute and chronic GVHD and the use of mismatched or unrelated donors. Sirolimus as prophylaxis against acute GVHD has been reported to result in a lower risk for CMV reactivation [14]. The mechanism behind this reduced risk is unknown. CMV might also be one factor in the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD [15, 16].",

            "text": "Since the prognosis of established CMV disease is still poor, preventive measures are very important. The available strategies can be divided into prevention of a primary infection, recurrence of CMV (prophylaxis), and prevention of development of disease when a reactivation has occurred (preemptive therapy). Serology should be performed before SCT in both patients and donors. Patients who are CMV seronegative before SCT should if possible be transplanted from a CMV seronegative donor [17]. To reduce the risk of CMV transmission from blood products, blood products from CMV seronegative donors or leukocyte depleted blood products should be used, as CMV is mainly harbored in the leukocyte fraction [18-20]. Which strategy is preferable is still not definitively settled [21, 22]. In many centers, and even in entire countries, leukocyte filtration is obligatory for all blood products and no study has in a controlled fashion compared the benefit of use of seronegative blood to that of already filtered blood products. IV immune globulin has at best a minor effect and has therefore been replaced by other more effective strategies. High doses of acyclovir and valacyclovir can reduce the risk for CMV infection [23-26]. Valacyclovir can reduce the need for preemptive therapy to approximately 50% [26]. I.v. ganciclovir is effective for prevention of CMV disease [27, 28]. However, these studies were performed before the widespread use of growth factors such as G-CSF and ganciclovir induced neutropenia was a problem in both studies. Valganciclovir is the product of ganciclovir giving similar blood levels as i.v ganciclovir but no study has evaluated its efficacy as a prophylactic agent.",

For patients with CMV disease other than pneumonia, the addition of immune globulin does not seem to be beneficial [51].

Riddell et al. have shown that specific CTL can be cloned in vitro, safely be given to the patient, and their activity be detectable during follow-up [52, 60, 61].

Serology is useful for determining the risk for reactivated HSV infection and should be performed before transplantation. The manifestations in transplant patients can be atypical causing generalized inflammation and pain from the mucous membranes without classical vesicular or ulcerative lesions. Generalized and invasive disease can occur but encephalitis is not more frequent in immunocompromised compared to immune competent patients. Acyclovir prophylaxis is indicated in all HSV seropositive SCT recipients [67]. The duration of antiviral prophylaxis should be at least during the aplastic phase but a longer duration should be considered in patients with GVHD or a history of frequent reactivations before the transplantation [67]. A recent study has shown a 2-year probability for HSV disease of 32% when acyclovir was given for 30 days compared to 0% if prolonged prophylaxis was given [68]. Acyclovir resistant virus strains are still quite rare but seem to be more common in high risk patients such as unrelated donor transplants or patients with severe GVHD [69-71]. However, the risk was reported to be very low in patients receiving prolonged prophylaxis [68]. The recommended drug for acyclovir-resistant HSV is foscarnet [72-74]. Two reports have described mutants resistant to both acyclovir and foscarnet [69, 70]. Currently, the only available antiviral drug available for treatment of double resistant HSV is cidofovir.",

            "text": "A primary VZV infection (varicella) is an uncommon but severe complication in SCT patients [75]. Seronegative patients are at risk for developing varicella and preventive measures are therefore indicated. The risk is highest in children but cases of varicella-like disease in seropositive adults becoming seronegative after SCT have been described. Serology is therefore important to identify patients at risk for varicella and should be performed in all patients before and at regular intervals after SCT. Varicella-zoster immune globulin is the recommended prophylactic measure in seronegative patients if it can be given within 4 days after a household or other type of close exposure [67]. Another option is prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir but there are no published data regarding effectiveness. Reactivated VZV infection - herpes zoster - develops in approximately one third of the SCT recipients in the absence of prophylaxis [78-79]. Severe and fatal cases have also been reported after allogeneic SCT with reduced conditioning. Herpes zoster is usually dermatomal but disseminated and potentially fatal infections with visceral involvement can occur [75]. The clinical picture might be atypical with gastro-intestinal, liver, or CNS disease occurring in the absence of skin lesions. The risk of herpes zoster is highest between 3 and 6 months after transplantation and decreases thereafter steadily over the first 2 years after SCT [80]. Therefore, the duration of antiviral prophylaxis must be long to be effective. A rebound phenomenon occurs when prophylaxis is given for 6 months [81, 82] but does not exist if prophylaxis is given for 12 months [83]. Longer prophylaxis reduces the rates even further especially in patients with chronic GVHD [80]. The recommended therapy for primary varicella, disseminated herpes zoster, or localized zoster developing early after SCT or in patient on treatment for GVHD is intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg (or 500 mg/m2) three times daily. For localized dermatomal herpes zoster occurring late after SCT especially on patients of immunosuppression, clinical experience suggests that oral therapy with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valaciclovir is effective in the majority of patients [84, 85].",

However, only a few case reports have suggested that it directly causes significant disease such as meningo-encephalitis [91]. EBV induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a serious complication to allogeneic SCT. Although the incidence of EBV-PTLD is generally lower than 2% following allogeneic SCT, it may increase up to 20% in patients with risk factors such as mismatched donor SCT, the use of an EBV positive donor to an EBV negative recipient, T-cell depletion, ATG therapy, and other forms of intensified immunosuppression for prevention and treatment of GVHD [92, 93]. Cord-blood SCT recipients receiving reduced intensity conditioning including ATG were reported to have a high risk for EBV associated complications [94]. EBV-PTLD usually occurs during the first 3 months after SCT although it can present later.",

The usefulness of viral load monitoring depends on the likelihood for a patient developing PTLD. The positive predictive values vary greatly between different studies [98] with the highest for patients having risk factors for EBV-PTLD [95, 96, 98]. Despite these uncertainties, monitoring of viral load seems to be a valuable tool especially in high risk patients. As many different techniques using different materials and primers exist, no cut-off viral load for initiating therapy can be recommended. However, rapid increase in viral load has been suggested to be associated with a high risk for EBV-PTLD.",

Approximately 35 case reports have been published [110, 114-128]. A summary of published information around these cases regarding patient characteristics, diagnostic findings, and outcome of HHV-6 CNS disease in SCT patients is shown in Table 29-2. Lethargy, confusion, convulsions, and decreased consciousness are the predominant clinical manifestations of HHV-6 encephalitis. Focal neurological findings have been reported but are less common. Magnetic resonance imaging can show abnormalities but it can also be normal. These changes included multiple, non-enhancing, low attenuation lesions in the gray matter. EEG usually shows diffuse changes. The prognosis is poor unless the encephalitis is treated with antiviral drugs. Both ganciclovir and foscarnet have been reported being effective against HHV-6 meningo-encephalitis after SCT (Table 29.2) [114, 129]. Another possible manifestation of HHV-6 is bone marrow suppression or delayed engraftment as HHV-6 can infect hematological progenitor cells and reduce colony formation [87, 110, 130-132].\n",

Recently several new viruses have been discovered including bocavirus and two papovaviruses that can cause respiratory disease. The epidemiological situation in the local community has been shown to influence the risk for infection in the SCT patients. This at least partly explains the variation in frequencies of diagnosed infections between different studies [133-136]. Respiratory viruses can be spread nosocomially through immune competent staff and patient relatives and outbreaks of both RSV and parainfluenza infections have been documented in transplant units [137-141]. Thus, infection control measures including isolation of symptomatic patients, use of sensitive diagnostic procedures, and as far as possible avoidance of exposure to infected persons including family and staff are important in the management of respiratory infections. The influence of respiratory virus infections on transplant related mortality has been estimated by a study by the EBMT. In that study 1.1% of allogeneic patients transplanted at the participating centers died of a respiratory virus infection [133]. Furthermore, RSV [142, 143] and parainfluenza infections [143] have also been implicated in the development of late respiratory dysfunction after SCT.",

This might explain some of the inconsistencies in the treatment results with ribavirin. Cidofovir might have effect against adenovirus infections but no controlled studies have been performed in SCT recipients. Reported results have been varying but it seems probable that cidofovir has an anti-adenoviral effect in many patients but it alone cannot give long-term control as development of a specific T-cell response is necessary [187-193].

In a seronegative recipient, the use of an HBV antigen positive marrow donor should if possible be avoided as the risk for transfer of HBV is high and hepatitis is likely to develop [203]. If a seropositive donor must be used, vaccination of the patient before transplant would be logical as patients who are antibody positive to HBV before transplant are less likely to develop severe liver complications [196, 204].

Both BK- and JC-viruses are excreted in the urine of many patients after transplant. Papovaviruria has been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis although there is no absolute correlation. Higher viral loads in urine, mutations in a viral gene, and BK-viremia have been correlated to hemorrhagic cystitis [220-226]. However, also transplant factors such as allogeneic rather than autologous SCT, myeloablative conditioning, and the use of mismatched or unrelated donors have also been shown to correlate to hemorrhagic cystitis [223, 224, 227, 228]. Thus, the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic cystitis seems to be multifactorial [229]. Cidofovir has in small uncontrolled studies been reported to be effective against polyoma virus-associated HC [230, 231].

There is no proven effective treatment, although two cases described by Kanfer et al. [242] appeared to respond to oral immunoglobulin (6 g daily for 5 days). Coxsackie A1 virus infection with diarrhea and a significant mortality has been reported in BMT patients [241]. The diagnosis can be obtained with virus isolation from stool, cerebrospinal fluid, secretions from nose and pharynx, tears, and urine and by serology. Prolonged enteroviral infection has been described in a BMT recipient who developed pericarditis and heart failure posttransplant [243]. Although no formal study has been performed, it seems likely that these outbreaks are associated with the epidemiological situation in the community and awareness of the local situation can be of value.",
