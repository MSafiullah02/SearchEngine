The number of studies on RV function in sepsis by conventional echocardiography is limited.

In spite of the norepinephrine\u2010induced increase in LV filling pressure, which should potentially augment the preload\u2010sensitive LV GLS,21 such an increase was antagonised by the simultaneous increase in LV afterload, resulting in no net effect on LV GLS.21 Our data do not support the findings from the recent study by Hamzaoui et al24 They showed that norepinephrine administration during early (within 3 hours) resuscitation of septic shock patients, to increase MAP from 56 to 80 mmHg, increased LV ejection fraction. They attributed this beneficial effect of norepinephrine to a restoration of a low diastolic arterial pressure, which would improve coronary perfusion and LV performance and/or a norepinephrine\u2010induced stimulation of upregulated \u03b2\n1\u2010adrenergic receptors.",

Another limitation is that the lowest MAP (60 mmHg), used in the present study, is not supported by guidelines for management of septic shock (\u226565 mmHg). Another limitation is that we only studied the acute effects of NE on cardiac function and pulmonary haemodynamics and we can therefore not draw conclusions on the potential long\u2010term effects of norepinephrine on these variables in septic shock. The strength of this study is that data on RV and LV deformation, as well as, pulmonary and systemic haemodynamics, including pulmonary vascular resistance, RV and LV arterial elastance and RV and LV preload, were simultaneously obtained from the same patient.",

The mechanisms behind this improvement could be an increase in RV preload, caused by a norepinephrine\u2010induced venoconstriction and increased myocardial contractility, together with a neutral effect of norepinephrine on pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload.",
