In patients with cancer, hMPV incidence is similar to that in the immunocompetent population (approximately 7%).8, 9 hMPV\u2010associated LRI has been reported in as many as 41% of patients with cancer8 and 100% of children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).10 Yet hMPV\u2010associated mortality remains low8, 9, 11 unless bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings are positive for the virus.12 These studies were limited by small sample size and inadequate power to determine risk factors and outcomes of hMPV infections in patients with cancer and associated mortality and morbidity.13 Although supportive measures may be in place, hMPV treatment remains a challenge, because the only in vitro, active drug choice is ribavirin for inhibition of hMPV replication.14, 15 In addition, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) with or without ribavirin have been used in patients with hMPV infections16, 17, 18 with lack of systematic evaluation for efficacy. The ECIL 4 European Conference on Infections in Leukemia addressed community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses, including hMPV; however, this therapy lacks systematic evaluation.19\n",

Hypoxia at the time of diagnosis was a substantial risk factor in the multivariable analysis. Hypoxia and a supplemental oxygen requirement at diagnosis are associated with higher rates of LRI and death in patients with cancer who have RSV, PIV, and influenza.23 Oxygen use may be a surrogate marker for the extent of lung injury, which may lead to poor outcomes.24 It is interesting to note that an underlying diagnosis of HM significantly increased the risk for LRI. Currently, there are limited data on hMPV infections in patients with HM and their impact; however, underlying HM was reported as a significant risk factor for progression to LRI in patients with PIV\u2010associated respiratory infections.25 Patients with HM might have a high level of immunosuppression caused by active chemotherapy at the time of hMPV infection or because of their underlying relapsed or refractory disease with subsequent prolonged cytopenias compared with engrafted HCT recipients who are in remission.26, 27 Nosocomial acquisition of hMPV was associated with a significantly higher risk for hMPV\u2010associated LRI. Substantial numbers of nosocomial hMPV infections also were described in a previous hMPV study of patients with HM.8 Respiratory viruses can be transmitted from either asymptomatic or symptomatic patients, family members, or health care workers.

Levels of \u03b3\u2010globulin are much lower in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have a history of any infection than in those who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia with no history of infection.36 This suggests that higher \u03b3\u2010globulin levels can protect against worse outcomes. Standard IVIG administration can inhibit hMPV replication in vitro,14 so we hypothesize that IVIG administration may be beneficial in HCT recipients to prevent progression from hMPV URI to LRI; however, an association between IVIG administration and LRI prevention could not be demonstrated in our study and needs to be systematically determined in future trials. We did not identify other significant risk factors, such as age, smoking status, levels of immunodeficiency (ANC, ALC), type of conditioning regimen, cytomegalovirus serostatus of the donor or recipient, graft\u2010versus\u2010host\u2010disease, time of engraftment, HCT cell source, or HCT recipient exposure to steroids. In a 2015 study, receipt of \u2265 1 mg/kg of steroids within 2 weeks before diagnosis was the only significant risk factor identified for progression to LRI according to a multivariate regression analyses of 118 HCT recipients.37\n",

However, the mortality rate after hMPV infections is lower than that associated with other related viruses, such as RSV. Patients with HM, nosocomial infections, and hypoxia at presentation should be closely monitored for risk of progression to LRI. Because hMPV may be acquired nosocomially, leading to worse outcomes and high morbidity, strict adherence to infection\u2010control measures and universal hand hygiene should be underscored. The significance of \u03b3\u2010globulin levels and the role of IVIG in preventing hMPV\u2010associated LRI and/or mortality should be determined in future studies, especially among HCT recipients and patients with HM.",
