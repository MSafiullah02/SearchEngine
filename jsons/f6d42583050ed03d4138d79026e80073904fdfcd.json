            "text": "We read with interest the editorial by Prof. Ioannidis, 1 expressing concern on the exaggerated information regarding the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. 2 Certainly, clinicians worldwide are facing new and enormous challenges when considering patients with suspected COVID-19; unfortunately, while the situation in China and Eastern Asia has shown a reduction in the number of new diagnosis in the last couple of weeks, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Europe, and in particular in Italy, has seen a dramatic increase, with more than 160 000 cases and 20 000 deaths as of 14 April 2020. 3 Even in this pandemic phase, however, it should not be forgotten that the diagnosis of COVID-19 does not imply the exclusion of other concomitant diseases. A list of viral and bacterial agents causing symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 is shown in Table 1 . We recently hospitalized a 28-year-old woman with a history of fever and sore throat in the last 48 hours with no known comorbidities. Following access to the emergency room, she reported contacts with relatives residing in Lombardia, the Italian region with the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases; she was then promptly placed in isolation and a nasopharyngeal swab was performed for SARS-CoV-2, which came back positive. At the same time, given the pharyngodynia and the finding of tonsillar hypertrophy, serologies for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were requested, with the finding of positive serology for EBV (IgM antibodies > 160 U/mL, IgG antibodies < 10 U/mL) and a EBV-DNA determination of 606 620 U/mL. Blood tests documented lymphocytosis (total white cells 15 450/mm 3 , lymphocytes 9920/mm 3 ), a rise in lactic dehydrogenase and transaminases (both AST and ALT), with a C-reactive protein value of 36 mg/L. Chest X-ray showed no pathological signs. In the first 48 hours of admission, we observed a decline in clinical conditions, due to the worsening of the tonsillar hypertrophy, with the appearance of dysphagia for solids and liquids, tachypnoea and dyspnoea and the persistence of low-grade fever. After careful evaluation, steroid therapy was started, with rapid improvement in clinical conditions; in particular, respiratory rate normalized and dyspnoea and dysphagia resolved. The patients was discharged after 12 days from admission with no need for further treatment or follow-up. It is to be noted that, considering the absence of signs of pneumonia, no antiviral treatment against COVID-19 was prescribed.",

            "text": "With this example, we wanted to point out that SARS-CoV-2 infection may accompany various other clinical conditions and, therefore, clinicians should always maintain a high level of attention when evaluating patients with COVID-19, since the anxiety and worry that are now associated with this new entity could lead to errors and misdiagnoses. Moreover, it is important not to rule out any therapeutic choice but to consider each case individually; in our case, the patient required steroid therapy due to mononucleosis, with the risk of causing a sudden worsening of lung function. The risk of starting cortisone therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to the increased viral replication. 4 Although steroid therapy has shown some benefit in the course of ARDS, guidelines advise against the use of corticosteroids in patients with confirmed COVID-19. 5 Despite our concerns, we observed no complications and the patient did not need antiviral therapy for COVID-19. In conclusion, the alarm caused by a new pandemic should not lead clinicians to the mistake of not looking for the right diagnosis and making the right choices for each patient.",
