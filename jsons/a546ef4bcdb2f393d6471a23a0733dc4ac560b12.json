Older crisis types did not disappear: ancient types such as floods and earthquakes remain with us.

For example, in 2004, toxic chemicals were successfully used to eradicate massive locust infestations affecting ten Western and Northern African countries. Those very chemicals had other widespread negative effects on humans, animals and crops (IRIN, 2004) . Implicit in this line of thinking is the argument that double-edged consequences from new innovations (such as the use of chemicals, nuclear power and genetic engineering) will continue to appear (Tenner, 1996) .",

This is somewhat contrary to what is implicit in much of the social science literature especially about disasters. In fact, some of these writings directly or indirectly state that a fatalistic attitude prevailed in the early stages of societal development (e.g., Quarantelli, 2000) . This was thought because religious beliefs attributed negative societal happenings to punishments or tests 1 This seems to have occurred about five to six thousand years ago (see Lenski, Lenski, & Nolan, 1991) . However, recent archeological studies suggest that humans started to abandon nomadic wanderings and settled into permanent sites around 9,500 years ago (Balter, 2005) so community recognized disasters and crises might have an even longer history. by supernatural entities (the \"Acts of God\" notion, although this particular phrase became a common usage mostly because it served the interests of insurance companies). But prayers, offerings and rituals are widely seen as means to influence the supernatural.

In ancient Greece, Aristotle categorized disasters as the result of natural phenomena and not manifestations of supernatural interventions (Aristotle, 1952) . The spread of Christianity about 2,000 years ago helped foster the belief that disasters were \"special providences sent directly\" from \"God to punish sinners\" (Mulcahy, 2002, p. 110) . In the Middle Ages, even scholars and educated elites \"no longer questioned the holy origins of natural disasters\" (Massard-Guilbaud, Platt, & Schott, 2002, p. 19) . Starting in the 17th century, however, explanations started to be replaced by \"ones that viewed disasters as accidental or natural events\" (Mulcahy, 2002, p. 110) . This, of course, also reflected a strong secularization trend in Western societies. Perhaps this reached a climax with the 1755 Lisbon earthquake which Dynes notes can be seen as the \"first modern disaster\" (2000, p. 10).",

            "text": "So far our discussion has been mostly from the perspective of the educated elites in Western societies. Little scholarly attention seems to have been given to what developed in non-Western social systems. One passing observation about the Ottoman Empire and fire disasters suggests that the pattern just discussed might not be universal. Thus, while fire prevention measures were encouraged in cities, they were not mandated \"since calamities were considered\" as expressions of the will of God (Yerolympos, 2002, p. 224) . Even as late as 1826 an Ottoman urban building code stated that according to religious writing \"the will of the Almighty will be done\" and nothing can and should be done about that. At the same time, this code advances the idea that nevertheless there were protective measures that could be taken against fires that are \"the will of Allah\" (quoted in Yerolympos, 2002, p. 226) . Of course, incompatibility between natural and supernatural views about the world are not unique to disaster and crisis phenomena, but that still leaves the distinction important. 2 Even recently, an Australian disaster researcher asserted that in the 2004 Southwestern Asian tsunami most of the population seemed to believe that the disaster was \"sent either as a test of faith or punishment\" (McAneney, 2005, p. 3). Or as another writer noted, following the tsunami, religiously oriented views surfaced. Some were by: \"fundamentalist Christians\" who tend to view all disasters \"as a harbinger of the apocalypse\". Others were by \"radical Islamists\" who are inclined to see any disaster that \"washes the beaches clear of half-nude tourists to be divine\" (Neiman, 2005, p. 16) . After Hurricane Katrina, some leaders of evangelical groups spoke of the disaster as punishment imposed by God for \"national sins\" (Cooperman, 2005) .",

Stories that a Chinese Emperor, 23 centuries before Christ, deepened the ever-flooding Yellow River by massive dredging and the building of diversion canals may be more legend than fact (Waterbury, 1979, p. 35) . However, there is clear evidence that in Egypt in the 20th Century BC, the 12th Dynasty Pharaoh, Amenemher II completed southwest of Cairo what was probably history's first substantial river control project (an irrigation canal and dam with sluice gates). Other documentary evidence indicates that dams for flood control purposes were built as far back as 1260 B C in Greece (Schnitter, 1994, p. 1, 8-9) . Such mitigatory efforts indicate both the belief that there was a long-term natural risk as well as one that could be coped with by physically altering structural dimensions.",

For example, earthquake resistant building techniques were developed in ancient Rome, although \"they had been forgotten by the middle ages\" (Massard-Guilbaud et al., 2002, p. 31) . The threats from floods and fires spurred mitigation efforts in Greece. Starting in the 15th Century, developing urban areas devised many safeguards against fires, varying from regulations regarding inflammable items to storage of water for firefighting purposes. In many towns in medieval Poland, dams, dikes and piles along riverbanks were built (Sowina, 2002) . Of course, actions taken were not always successful. But, if nothing else, these examples show that organized mitigation efforts have been undertaken for a long time in human history.",

One has been the routinization of responses by emergency oriented groups so as to prevent emergencies from escalating into disasters or crises. For example, in ancient Rome, the first groups informally set up to fight fires were composed of untrained slaves. But when a fire in 6 A.D. burned almost a quarter of Rome, a Corps of Vigiles was created that had full-time personnel and specialized equipment. In more recent times, there are good examples of this routinization in the planning of public utilities that have standardized operating procedures to deal with everyday emergencies so as to prevent them from materializing into disasters. In the conflict area, there are various UN and other international organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union (EU), that also try to head off the development of crises. In short, societies have continually evolved groups and procedures to try to prevent old and new risks and threats from escalating into disasters and crises.",

Societies for about a century have been creating specific organizations to deal first with new risks for civilians created by changes in warfare, and then improving on these new groups as they have been extended to peacetime situations. Rooted in civil defense groups created for air raid situations, there has since been the evolvement of civilian emergency management agencies (Blanchard, 2004) .

There is far from full agreement that all disasters and crises can be categorized together as being relatively homogeneous phenomena (Quarantelli, 1998; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005) . This is despite the fact that there have been a number of attempts to distinguish between, among and within different kinds of disasters and crises. However, no one overall view has won anywhere near general acceptance among self-designated disaster and crisis researchers. To illustrate we will briefly note some of the major formulations advanced. For example, one attempt has been to distinguish between natural and technological disasters (Erikson, 1994; Picou & Gill, 1996) . The basic assumption was that the inherent nature of the agent involved made a difference. Implicit was the idea that technological dangers or threats present a different and more varying kind of challenge to human societies than do natural hazards or risks. Most researchers have since dropped the distinction as hazards have come to be seen as less important than the social setting in which they appear. In recent major volumes on what is a disaster (Quarantelli, 1998; Perry & Quarantelli, 2005) , the distinction was not even mentioned by most of the two dozen scholars who addressed the basic question.",

Thus, some scholars distinguish between consensus and conflict types of crises (Stallings, 1988 tries to reconcile the two perspectives). In some research circles, almost all natural and most technological disasters are viewed as consensus types of crises (Quarantelli, 1998) . These are contrasted with crises involving conflict such as are exemplified by riots, terrorist attacks, and ethnic cleansings and intergroup clashes. In the latter type, at least one major party is either trying to make it worse or to extend the duration of the crisis. In natural and technological disasters, no one deliberately wants to make the situation worse or create more damage or fatalities. Now, there can be disputes or serious disagreements in natural or technological disasters.",

For example, looting behavior is distinctively different in the two types. In the typical disaster in Western societies, almost always looting is rare, covert and socially condemned, done by individuals, and involves targets of opportunity. In contrast, in many conflict crises looting is very common, overt and socially supported, undertaken by established groups of relatives or friends, and involves deliberately targeted locations (Quarantelli & Dynes, 1969) . Likewise, there are major differences in hospital activities in the two kinds of crises, with more variation in conflict situations. There are differences also in the extent to which both organizational and community-level changes occur as a result of consensus and conflict crises, with more changes resulting from conflict occasions (Quarantelli, 1993) . Finally, it has been suggested that the mass media system operates differently in terrorism situations and in natural and technological disasters (Project for Excellence in Journalism, 1999 Journalism, , 2001 . 3 Both the Oklahoma City bombing and the 9-11 World Trade Center attack led to sharp clashes between different groups of initial organizational responders. There were those who saw these happenings primarily as criminal attacks necessitating closure of the location as a crime 3 For a contrary view that sees terrorist occasions as more or less being the same as what behaviorally appears in natural and technological disasters (Fischer, 2003) . scene, and those who saw them primarily as situations where priority ought to be on rescuing survivors.

In this line of thinking, a crisis involves an urgent threat to the core functions of a social system. A disaster is seen as \"a crisis with a bad ending\" (Boin, 2005) . This is consistent with the earlier expressed idea that while there are many hazards and risks, only a few actually manifest themselves. But the crisis idea does not differentiate among the manifestations themselves as the consensus and conflict distinction does. This is not the place to try and settle conceptual disagreements and we will not attempt to do so. Anyone in these areas of study should acknowledge that there are different views and different proponents should try to make their positions as explicit as possible so people do not continue to talk past one another. It is perhaps not amiss here to note that the very words or terms used to designate the core nature of the phenomena are etymologically very complex with major shifts in meaning through time. 4 We are far from having standardized terms and similar connotations and denotations for them.",

The result was that there was widespread anxiety in the area resulting in the closing of schools, the cancellation of many meetings and, because visitors and tourists stayed away, a considerable negative effect on the economy (Commission Report, 2004, p. 28) . The Commission Report notes a lack of coordination among the multitude of private and public sector organizations involved, a lack of consistent information on what was really happening, and jurisdictional squabbling on who should be doing what. Although SARS vanished worldwide after June 2003, to this day it is still not clear why it became so virulent in the initial outbreak and why it has disappeared (Yardley, 2005) .",

Just the thinking of the possibility of how, when and where ahead of time coastal population evacuations might have to be undertaken, is a daunting thought. Statistically less likely is a landing in a heavily populated area. But a terrestrial impact anywhere on land would generate very high quantities of dust in the atmosphere, which will affect food production as well as creating economic disruption. This would be akin to the Tambora volcanic eruption in 1813, which led to very cold summers and crop failures (Post, 1977) .

But the double-edged possibilities mentioned earlier are also present. There is dispute over genetically modified crops, with many European countries resisting and preventing their use and spread in their countries. While no major disaster or crisis from this biotechnology has yet occurred, there have been many accidents and incidents that suggest that this will be only a matter of time. For example, in 2000, StarLink corn, approved only for animal feed is found in the food supply, such as taco shells and other groceries. The same year farmers in Europe learned that that they had unknowingly been growing modified canola using mixed seed from Canada. In 2001, modified corn was found in Mexico even though it was illegal to plant in that country. That same year, experimental corn that had been engineered to produce a pharmaceutical that was found in soybeans in the state of Nebraska. In several places, organic farmers found that it was impossible for them to keep their fields uncontaminated (for further details about all these incidents and other examples, see Pollack, 2004) . Noticeable is the leaping of boundaries and uncertainty about the route of spreading.

We should be able to do a better job than we have so far in making projections about the future. But perhaps that is asking more of disaster and crisis researchers than is reasonable. After all, social scientists with expertise in certain areas, to take recent examples, failed completely to predict or forecast the non-violent demise of the Soviet Union, the peaceful transition in South Africa, or the development of a market economy in communist China (cf. Tetlock, 2005) .",

These systems can and do differ in social structures and cultural frameworks. There has been a bias in disaster and crisis research towards focusing on specific agents and specific events. Thus, there is the inclination of social science researchers to say they studied this or that earthquake, flood, explosion and/or radioactive fallout. At one level that is nonsense. These terms refer to geophysical, climatological or physical happenings, which are hardly the province of social scientists. Instead, those focused on the social in the broad sense of the term should be studying social phenomena. Our view is that what should be looked at more is not the possible agent that might be involved, but the social setting of the happening. This becomes obvious when researchers have to look at such happenings as the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami or locust infestations in Africa. Both of these occasions impacted a variety of social systems as well as involving social actors from outside those systems. This led in the tsunami disaster to sharp cultural clashes regarding on how to handle the dead between Western European organizations who came into look mostly for bodies of their tourist citizens, and local groups who had different beliefs and values with respect to dead bodies (Scanlon, personal communication with first author).",

They suggest, for instance, that an earthquake of the same magnitude in France to one in Iran will probably be reacted to differently. A riot in Sweden will be a different phenomenon than one in Myanmar. To understand and analyze such happenings requires taking into account the aspects just discussed. It is hard to believe that countries that currently have no functioning national government, such as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo or marginally operatives ones such as Afghanistan, will have the same reaction to disasters and crises as societies with fully functional national governments. Different kinds of disasters and crises will occur in rather different social settings. In fact, events that today are considered disasters or crises were not necessarily so viewed in the past. In noting these cross-societal and cross-cultural differences, we are not saying that there are no universal principles of disaster and crisis behavior. There is considerable research evidence supportive of this notion. We would argue, for example, that many aspects of effective warning systems, problems of bureaucracies in responding, the crucial importance of the family/household unit are roughly the same in all societies. To suggest the importance of cross-societal and cross-cultural differences is simply to suggest that good social science research needs to take differences into account while at the same time searching for universal principles about disasters and crises. This is consistent with those disaster researchers and scholars (e.g., Oliver-Smith, 1994) who have argued that studies in these areas have badly neglected the historical context of such happenings. Of course, this neglect of the larger and particularly historical context has characterized much social science research of any kind (Wallerstein, 1995) ; it is not peculiar to disaster and crisis studies.",

Pidgeon, Kasperson, and Slovic (2003) described a social augmentation process with respect to risk. To them, risk not only depends on the character of the dangerous agent itself but how it was seen in the larger context in which it appeared. The idea that there can be social amplification of risk rests on the assumption that aspects relevant to hazards interact with processes of a psychological, social, institutional, and cultural nature in such a manner that they can increase or decrease perceptions of risk (Kasperson & Kasperson, 2005) . It is important to note that the perceived risk could be raised or be diminished depending on the factors in the larger context, which makes it different from the vulnerability paradigm which tends to assume the factors involved will be primarily negative ones. We have taken this idea and extended it to the behaviors that appear in disasters and crises. Extreme heat waves and massive blizzards are hardly new weather phenomena (Burt, 2004) . There have recently been two heat waves, however, that have new elements in them. In 2003, a long lasting and very intensive heat wave battered France. Nearly 15,000 persons died (and perhaps 22,000-35,000 in all of Europe). Particularly noticeable was that the victims were primarily socially isolated older persons. Another characteristic was that officials were very slow in accepting the fact that there was a problem and so there was very little initial response (Lagadec, 2004) . There was a similar earlier happening 1995 in Chicago not much noticed until reported in a study seven years later (see Klinenberg, 2002) . It exhibited the same features, that is, older isolated victims, bureaucratic indifference, and mass media uncertainty.",

It took months of investigation to establish the exact path of failure propagation through a huge, complex network. Telecommunication and electrical infrastructures entwined in complex interconnected and network systems spread over a large geographic area with multiple end users.

More important, emergent difficulties were actually somewhat better handled than in the past, perhaps reflecting that officials may have had exposure to earlier studies and reports. Thus, the warnings issued and the evacuations that took place were better than in the past. Looting concerns were almost non-existent and less than ten percent indicated possible mental health effects. The pre-impact organizational mobilization and placement of resources beyond the community level was also better. The efficiency and effectiveness of local emergency management offices were markedly higher than in the past. Not everything was done well. Long known problematical aspects and failures to implement measures that research had suggested a long time ago were found. There were major difficulties in interorganizational coordination.

This was accompanied by the widespread cancellations of religious and sport events. There was across the board disruption of air, road and train services. All of this resulted in major economic losses in the millions of dollars. There were scattered interruptions of critical life systems. The governor issued a state of emergency declaration and the state as well as local emergency management offices fully mobilized. To be sure, what happened did not fully rival what surfaced in the Canadian blizzard discussed earlier. But it would be difficult to argue that it did not meet criteria often used by many to categorize disasters. What happened was not that different from what others and we had experienced in the past.

Viewed this way, the newer kinds of communities can be seen as very important in planning for and managing disasters and crises that cut across national boundaries. To think this way requires a moving away from the traditional view of communities in the past.

Future work should focus more on the generating conditions. A general model would involve the following ideas. The first is to look at social systems (societal, community and/or organizational ones), and to analyze how they have become more complex and tightly coupled. The last statement would be treated as a working hypothesis. If that turns out to be true, it could then be hypothesized that systems can break down in more ways than ever before. A secondary research thrust would be to see if systems also have developed ways to deal with or cope with threatening breakdowns.

In short, what has to be looked for are genotypic characteristics not phenotypic ones (Perry, 2004) . If whales, human beings, and bats can all be usefully categorized as mammals for scientific research purposes, maybe students of disasters should also pay less attention to phenotypic features.
