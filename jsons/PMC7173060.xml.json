            "text": "Non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses are enveloped viruses with viral RNA (vRNA) in the opposite sense to that of mRNA. This order of viruses (Mononegavirales) contains the Paramyxoviridae (measles and Sendai virus), Bornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae (rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) and Filoviridae (Ebola virus). Negative strand RNA viruses cause important human and animal disease. In 2003, measles virus killed 760,000 children, mainly in Africa and Asia (WHO report, 2003). Rabies virus kills about 50,000 people per year in these continents but is also an increasing health concern in the USA.1 The vRNA of these viruses is bound to the viral nucleoprotein (N) with a virus-family-specific nucleotide-N stoichiometry.2, 3, 4, 5 The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consists of two subunits, the large protein (L) that contains the polymerase activity and a polymerase cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P) that binds L to the N-RNA.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 The polymerase complex cannot transcribe or replicate the naked vRNA; vRNA has to be bound to N in order to be a functional template.12\n",

The nuclear products of the P gene interact with PML (promyelocytic leukaemia) nuclear bodies that have been associated with the cellular defence mechanism against viral infections.26 The interaction of the P products with PML bodies may overcome the antiviral response of the cell. The Sendai virus P gene also codes for a number of different polypeptides that are generated by a stuttering mechanism of the polymerase that adds one or several G residues at a specific site in the mRNA for P.27, 28 Some of the viral polypeptides that result from this editing mechanism are also active in fighting the innate antiviral activity of the infected cell.29, 30\n",

The previously described mutations leading to loss of binding of this domain to N22 can now be interpreted in the light of this structure. This rabies virus P domain has a structure that is different from that of the functionally analogous domains of Sendai and measles virus P31, 32 and implications for the evolution of negative strand RNA viruses are discussed.",

The overall structure resembles a pear cut along its length with a flat face and a round face (Figure 6\nA and B). The top part of the half-pear is comprised of the first three helices (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13), with \u03b12 and \u03b13 packing perpendicularly to \u03b11. The abrupt change in direction between \u03b12 and \u03b13, provided by P245, is necessary for their packing against \u03b11. The lower part is comprised of the small \u03b2-sheet, with two helices (\u03b14 and \u03b15) packing against one side and \u03b16 capping one edge of the \u03b2-sheet. The two parts are packed together by hydrophobic interactions between \u03b12 and \u03b14, with some additional hydrophobic residues contributed by the C terminus of \u03b11. The flat face is composed mainly from \u03b1-helices, whereas the round face is made from the C terminus of \u03b11, the short \u03b2-sheet, the 310 helix and the loops connecting these secondary structures. A positive surface potential area exists on this round face, as calculated in GRASP34 (Figure 6A\u2013C). On the other hand, the flat face has a more symmetric charge distribution, with the main surface feature being a shallow uncharged groove, where one side is comprised of the loop between \u03b12 and \u03b13 and the C terminus of \u03b14, and the other side is comprised of \u03b16. This groove also contains a prominent hydrophobic pocket, the W-hole, composed of L244, P245, C261, W265, M287 and L291 (Figure 7\nA).",

Mokola virus is closely related to rabies virus and the sequences of the P proteins of the two viruses are very similar (Figure 2). The mutated residues in the Mokola virus P protein were compared to the corresponding residues in the rabies virus P protein. We have analysed the structural consequences of the mutations identified as having the largest effect on N-RNA binding (Table 2\n). Eleven of these mutants are expected to have a destabilising effect on the structure. Seven mutations form two major clusters on the surface. The first cluster comprises the highly conserved lysine residues (K211, K212 and K214) and L224 (Figure 6C and D). Two of the lysine residues contribute to the positive potential on the round face described above. The second cluster is comprised of three residues and is centred on the less conserved W-hole and includes C261, W265 and M287 (Figure 7). The remaining four mutations that replace lysine residues by uncharged or negatively charged amino acids are randomly spread with no discernible order (Figure 6, Figure 7). From this mutational analysis it would seem that both the positively charged patch on the round face of the domain and the W-hole on the flat face are important for binding to N-RNA.",

            "text": "Rabies virus phosphoprotein contains four potential phosphorylation sites.36 There is evidence that phosphorylation of the first two sites, S63 and S64, is mediated by a unique cellular protein kinase of 71 kDa that is packaged inside rabies virus particles, and is necessary during the infection process.36 The other two possible phosphorylation sites are S210 and S271 that can be phosphorylated in vitro by specific isomers of protein kinase C although it is not known whether this actually happens in the infected cell.36 S210 lies on a surface exposed loop between \u03b11 and \u03b21 and a phosphorylated serine residue can easily be created without any conformational change. Interestingly, this serine is also adjacent to the positively charged patch and the first cluster of mutations described above (Figure 6D). Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation of S210 would alter the N\u2013RNA binding characteristics of P. S271 is located between \u03b14 and \u03b15 and is only partly solvent-exposed and quite constricted (Figure 7C and D). It is therefore probable that some conformational rearrangement would be required for phosphorylation to occur. S271 is located between the two clusters of mutations and close to K272 that, when mutated to A, also prevents binding of P to N (Table 2 and Figure 7A).",

            "text": "The phosphoprotein binds the viral polymerase (L) to the nucleocapsid. Here, we show that the domain of P that performs this function is a C-terminal domain from residue 186 until the C-terminal end. Residues that are implicated in the interaction with N can be found on the round and flat faces of the domain (Figure 6, Figure 7). Toriumi et al. have described a monoclonal antibody that can distinguish two conformations of rabies virus P, one when it is soluble and one when it is bound to N\u2013RNA.37 The presumed epitope for this mAb is located around Q275 (Figure 7C and D). This suggests that binding of P to N\u2013RNA may be associated with a conformational change resulting in the rearrangement of helices 5 and 6. These C-terminal 24 residues of P can be deleted without inhibiting the binding of P to N\u2013RNA.21 It is, therefore, likely that \u03b15 and \u03b16 can occupy a conformation that is different from the one that is found in the crystal structure. Phosphorylation of S271 may have an influence on the structure of the protein in this area. Figure 7C and D show the molecule with the W-hole in yellow and helices 5 and 6 in green. These two helices lie in a hydrophobic groove (orange) and their displacement would expose this groove to the solvent. The conformation of the monomeric molecule described here is probably not stable when the two helices are displaced. Binding of P to N-RNA may involve complementary interactions from N, shielding the groove from the solvent. As mentioned above, a shallow uncharged groove is slightly exposed even with the helices in place, the W-hole making part of this surface structure.",

Because oligomerisation of Sendai virus P takes place through the formation of an inter-monomer helical coiled-coil,38 we suggest that the oligomerisation domain be situated in the predicted helical region between residues 93 and 130 (Figure 1, Figure 2). Jacob et al. have shown that a P mutant with a deletion from residue 61 to 175, so most likely monomeric, was still active in supporting transcription activity by L (Figure 2).22 This deletion mutant still has the L-binding and the N\u2013RNA binding domains. This is in contrast to the transcription and replication activities of the Sendai virus phosphoprotein that does require the presence of the oligomerisation domain.39, 40 The difference between these two phosphoproteins could be due to a higher affinity of rabies virus phosphoprotein for its N\u2013RNA than that of Sendai virus P for its N\u2013RNA. The C-terminal domains of Sendai and measles virus P that bind to their N\u2013RNAs41 are very small and flexible domains,31, 32 much smaller than the corresponding domain of rabies virus P. Another important reason why the P protein of Sendai virus has to be oligomeric in order to be active is that the binding domain for Sendai L overlaps with the oligomerisation domain38, 42 and that only oligomeric P can bind to L.",

There is no structural similarity between the C-terminal domains of Sendai/measles virus P and that of rabies virus P described here. Again, this suggests that the C-terminal domains of these P proteins do not come from the same evolutionary lineage.",

Heterologous recombination has been documented for Nidovirales (Arteri- and Coronaviruses), positive strand RNA viruses, where homologous RNA recombination by the viral polymerase is part of the mechanism for the production of mRNAs.52, 53 Homologous recombination inside gene segments of segmented negative strand RNA viruses has also been shown or suggested; recombination between the polymerase genes of two Arenavirus strains has been documented54 whereas recombination in the haemagglutinin gene of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus has been suggested from sequence comparisons.55 For heterologous recombination to occur, the viral polymerase has to jump from the viral N\u2013RNA template to a nucleoprotein-encapsidated host mRNA and then back again to the viral RNA template. Non-segmented negative strand virus nucleoprotein expressed alone in bacterial or eukaryotic cells binds in a non-specific fashion to cellular RNAs.5, 13, 56, 57, 58 Although during a virus infection most newly made N is first bound to the phosphoprotein in the N0\u2013P complex for delivery onto newly made vRNA, it is very likely that some N will nevertheless bind to cellular RNA providing an N-cellular RNA template for the viral polymerase. It is also known that these polymerases can jump either inside the viral N-RNA template59 or from the viral template to the newly copied, N-bound complementary strand in order to form copy-back interfering particles.60 Heterologous recombination for the influenza viruses was suggested from the structure of the influenza C virus glycoprotein.61 From a comparison between the influenza A and C haemagglutinin structures it was suggested that the influenza virus haemagglutinin consists of an ancestral fusion protein combined with an independent haemagglutinin domain, for influenza C virus further complemented by an esterase domain spliced into this haemagglutinin domain. The esterase domain is homologous to bovine brain and bacterial esterases.61 Finally, when Khatchikian et al.\n62 tried to select for a pathogenic turkey influenza virus to grow in chicken cells, they obtained a virulent mutant that had acquired 54 nt coming from the 28 S ribosomal RNA of the infected cells. This insertion led to a change in the presentation of the cleavage site on haemagglutinin to the cellular protease needed for proteolytic activation, allowing the virus to grow in the new host cells.",

The matrix proteins are not homologous nor are the phosphoproteins. The glycoproteins are probably also not conserved among all viruses. Although its structure is not yet known, the fusogenic glycoprotein of the rhabdoviruses has probably a very different structure from that of the fusion proteins of other negative strand RNA viruses because their fusion characteristics are so very different.63 Apart from these major viral proteins, many viruses of this group code for additional proteins for which no structures are known. The presence of heterologous matrix proteins in these viruses may be the reason why the shapes of the virus particles in this group are so variable, from more or less spherical (influenza, paramyxoviruses) to bullet-shaped (rhabdoviruses) and filamentous particles (filoviruses).",
