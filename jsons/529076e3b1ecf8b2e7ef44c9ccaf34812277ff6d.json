Second, rela ve to the equa on, they use a numerator greater than the actual one. Finally, in rela on to the denominator, they do not incorporate fundamental clinical-epidemiological variables. All this leads to a possible overes ma on of the total, with a risk of bias in the interpreta on and applicability of the results.
