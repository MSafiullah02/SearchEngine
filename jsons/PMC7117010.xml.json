            "text": "Mathematical models are increasingly used to guide public health policy decisions and for controlling infectious disease. Epidemic dynamics is an important method of studying the spread of infectious disease qualitatively and quantitatively. It is based on the specific property of population growth, the spread rules of infectious diseases, and the related social factors to construct mathematical models reflecting the dynamic properties of infectious diseases, to analyse the dynamical behaviour and to do some simulations. The research results are helpful to predict the developing tendency of the infectious disease, to determine the key factors of the spread of infectious disease and to seek the optimum strategies for preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Mathematical models have a long history in infectious disease ecology starting with Bernoulli\u2019s [1] modelling of smallpox and including Ross\u2019s [2] analysis of malaria. The earliest attempt to provide a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission was that of Ross (1911). Ross models consisted of a few differential equations to describe changes in densities of susceptible and infected people, and susceptible and infected mosquitoes. Based on his modelling, Ross introduced the concept of a threshold density and concluded that \u2018in order to counteract malaria anywhere we need not banish Anopheles there entirely we need only to reduce their numbers below a certain figure [3]. Classical papers of mathematical modelling of infectious disease was by Kermack and McKendrick (1927 [4], 1932 [5], and 1933 [6]). These papers had a major influence on the development of mathematical models for disease spread and are still relevant in many epidemic situations. Aim of ecological modelling is to understand the prevalence and distribution of a species, together with the factors that determine incidence, spread, and persistence (Anderson and May [7]; May and Anderson [8]; Bascompte and Rodriguez-Trelles [9]). We now have models for many of the most important human emerging infectious diseases e.g., HIV (May and Anderson [10]), malaria (Aron and May [11]; Macdonald [12]), SARS-coronavirus (Anderson et al. [13]), rabies (Murray and Seward [14]), and influenza (Ferguson and Anderson [15]). Mathematical models are also being used to explore wildlife disease dynamics (Grenfell and Dobson [16]; Hudson et al.[17]) and possible routes of zoonotic disease emergence. Understanding disease dynamics across hosts is an essential first step in understanding and articulating those conditions under which new diseases can emerge from wildlife reservoirs [18]. A predator\u2013prey system with infected prey in polluted environment is proposed by Sinha et al. [19]. Anderson and May [20] were probably the first who considered the disease factor in a predator\u2013prey dynamics and found that the pathogen tends to destabilize the predator\u2013prey interaction. In Rosenzweig predator\u2013prey model, Hadeler and Freedman [21] determined a threshold above which an infected equilibrium or an infected periodic solution appear. Chattopadhyay and Arino [22] considered a three species ecoepidemiological model and studied local stability of equilibrium points, extinction criteria of species and found condition for Hopf-bifurcation in an equivalent two-dimensional model. Haque and Chattopadhyay [23] studied the role of transmissible diseases in a prey dependent predator\u2013prey system with prey infection. Bhattacharyya et al. [24] proposed a epidemiological model with nonlinear infection incidence. In 2012, scientists [25], [26] investigated infectious disease model and suggested disease control strategies.",

However, there are now many problems associated with their continued deployment including increasing pressure to reduce chemical use in the environment in general, development of pesticide resistance in many pathogens, and decreasing availability of active ingredients through stricter registration and difficulty in finding novel active compounds. Consequently, the search for alternative non-chemical methods of disease control continues to gain significance. Some investigations [27], [28], [29] were done for population control in a predator\u2013prey model providing alternative food to predator. Disease controlling aspects of predator\u2013prey model providing alternative food to predator is unexplored. In this paper we formulate a diseased predator\u2013prey model in presence of alternative food for predator. This is a totally new research area which has applications in many important practical fields. This paper aims to analyse the role of alternative food for controlling disease in the system.",

This combination of functional forms are taken because the capturing of infected prey is easier than the susceptible prey.(f)Predators are provided with alternative food of constant biomass A which is distributed uniformly in the habitat. The constant biomass assumption is valid for many arthropod predators because they can feed on plant-provided alternative food sources such as pollen or nectar which approximately remains constant.(g)The number of encounters per predator with the alternative food is proportional to the density of the alternative food.(h)The proportionality constant characterizes the ability of the predator to identify the alternative food.With the above assumptions, we formulate the following model:(1)dSdT=R0S1-SK0-WSI-A1SPB1+\u03b1\u03bcA+S,dIdT=WSI-A2IPB1+\u03b1\u03bcA-D1I,\ndPdT=A1C1(S+\u03bcA)PB1+\u03b1\u03bcA+S+C2A2IPB1+\u03b1\u03bcA-D2P.\n",

Let the Jacobian matrix Jr(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t)) corresponding to ri is given by(3)Jr=F1s(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))F1i(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))F1p(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))0F2i(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))0F3s(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))F3i(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t))F3p(\u03d5r(t),0,\u03c8r(t)).\nHere F2i=-d+\u03b3\u03d5r(t)-\u03b2\u03c8r(t)1+\u03b1\u03be. Computing the fundamental matrix of the linear periodic systemM\u2032=Jr(t)M,M(0)=M0,we find that its Floquet multiplier in the i-direction is e\u03b6r(t). Then proceeding in an analogous manner like Kumar and Freedman [34], we conclude that no ri lies on \u03a9(X) . Thus, \u03a9(X) lies in the positive quadrant and system (2) is persistent. Finally, since only the closed orbits and the equilibria from the omega limit set of the solutions on boundary of R+3 and the system (2) is dissipative. Now using a theorem of Butler et al. [32], we conclude that system (2) is uniformly persistent.Note that the persistence condition of the system depends on infection rate, death rate of infected prey, death rate of predator, capturing rate of predator on infected prey and quality and quantity of alternative food.\n",

We have studied stability and persistence criterion of the system in presence of alternative food. One parameter bifurcation analysis is done with respect to infection rate using experimental and field data. Numerical simulation results predict that the system becomes disease free for lower infection rate (0\u2a7d\u03b3\u2a7d0.76) in absence of alternative food (Fig. 1). This is happening because infected prey is weaker than susceptible prey and is easily captured by predator. This will reduce the number of infected prey and ultimately the system may becomes disease free without alternative food at certain stage for lower infection rate. However, for higher infection rate (\u03b3>0.76), disease free system cannot be obtained without alternative food (Fig. 3). Whereas for higher infection rate disease free state may be reached by supplying suitable alternative food (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). It is evident from our study that high quality of alternative food (\u03b1<1) has the capability of making the system disease free for higher infection rate. Quantity of alternative food supply increases with the increase of infection rate for fixed quality to obtain a disease free system. Possible reason behind it is that with the supply of high quality or high quantity of alternative food, the predator catches the alternative food as well as infected prey at higher rate compare to susceptible prey. As a result, the growth rate of predator species will increase with the supply of high quality or high quantity of alternative food and it captures the infected prey population at faster rate than susceptible prey. Due to this, infected prey population become very very small at certain stage and consequently infection cannot spread at that stage and the system becomes disease free. Notice that there is a critical infection rate above which the alternative food may not be useful to make the system disease free. Results presented in the present paper provided a useful platform to understand the role of alternative food as disease controller in a diseased food chain model. A possible interesting aspects for future developments are to study the role of alternative food as a disease controller in different types of disease induced food chain models and also the study the effects of supplying alternative food to a network of infected food chain models. This new non-chemical method of disease control will be very useful for biological conservation of prey species in real world biological systems.",
