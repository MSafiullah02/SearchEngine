Such patients have a proinflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations8 and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection9 and pneumonia.10 Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study. An alternative explanation is that many patients with COVID-19 could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan. Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration.",

It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and SARS.5\n,\n11 In our study, indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders. This observation indicated poor prognosis regardless of initial COVID-19 severity and general physical condition. Monitoring kidney function must therefore be emphasized even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms, and altered kidney function should be given particular attention after admission in clinical practice. Early detection and treatment of renal abnormalities, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, may help to improve the vital prognosis of COVID-19.",

In our cohort, the detection rate of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 5.1%, which is in keeping with recent reports of small sample size1\n,\n4\n,\n7\n,\n13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study.14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our cohort study, 42.7% of patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan. Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate.15 In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.16 After adjusting for the frequency of serum creatinine, determinations of the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults rose to 11.6%.17 Thus, to improve early detection of kidney injury, more frequent serum creatinine measurements should be performed in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is likely to be multifactorial. First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of polymerase chain reaction fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in both the patients with the 2003 SARS virus18 and those with COVID-19.4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003.19 Recent human tissue RNA-sequencing data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung).20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2-dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T-cell lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from patients with SARS were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits.5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in patients with COVID-19 require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the patients with the 2009 H1N1 virus had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase.21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19, who were admitted to an intensive care unit, showed a tendency toward increased creatine kinase levels,13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",

We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoids may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe, thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoids in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19.22\n,\n23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including umifenovir, oseltamivir, and lopinavir with ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered.24 These potentially harmful effects may account for the low proportion of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors used by physicians in our cohort, especially in patients with AKI who had higher level of creatinine on admission. Due to the small number of patients with AKI and the bias in different therapy of patients with COVID-19, causal relationship between drug and AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains undetermined.",
