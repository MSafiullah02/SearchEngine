Advances in information technology have allowed pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance systems to calculate observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs ( proportional reporting ratios (PRRs)) [9\u201313]. The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) is calculated from the PRR and accounts for differences in reporting rates and variables within the dataset [14]. False positives, which are inherent to data mining systems, are avoided by increasing the number of reports and increasing PRR or EBGM, thereby strengthening the signal [12, 14]. Both PRR and EBGM ratios shrink toward one, and values \u22652 are considered to be the safety signal thresholds that warrant further evaluation. Previous studies have suggested PRRs to be more sensitive and EBGM more specific [12, 15]. Some studies minimize false negatives by using more than one data mining system; however, well-known drugs associated with ADRs continue to be missed, which is possibly secondary to underreporting. These are often older medications such as nitroglycerine infusions [16]. There are limited literature studies on ICU ADRs compared to medication error evaluation.",

The implicated final common pathway for each medication may include mast cell activation and nitric oxide (NO) signaling via nitric oxide synthase (e.g., N-acetylcysteine [22, 23] and calcium [24]), NO donors and NO-like compounds (e.g., nitroprusside [25]), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (e.g., amphotericin [26]), S-nitrosylation and transnitrosylation (e.g., adenosine [27\u201329], iron, N-acetylcysteine, and nitroprusside), histamine release (e.g., amphotericin [26], N-acetylcysteine [20], and vancomycin [30]), and cytokine release (e.g., amphotericin [26], N-acetylcysteine [20], and immunoglobulins) [31\u201334]. Sometimes, clinical effects are caused by an excipient such as polyethoxylated castor oil which has been used as the solubilizing vehicle for phytonadione [35]. Some drugs such as N-acetylcysteine have been prospectively studied. When administered rapidly, N-acetylcysteine has caused mild, moderate, and severe infusion reactions for up to 60%, 30%, and 10% of patients, respectively [20]. This association may be underreported, as this drug does not appear in the table of drugs associated with infusion reactions. The medical toxicologist may see infusion reactions related to IV N-acetylcysteine, although slower infusion rates have made this less common [20, 21, 23, 36, 37].",

Angioedema associated with the use of drugs can manifest after the first dose of a drug, but for some drugs, such as those targeting the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, it can occur at any time [39]. The presence of angioedema with wheals or urticaria suggests the etiology involves mast cells. Culprit medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antibiotics, often acting through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase resulting in alteration in the metabolism of arachidonic acid with increased leukotrienes [40\u201342]. Angioedema without wheals or urticaria could be bradykinin mediated, which implicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [38]. Bradykinin accumulation results in an increased vascular permeability resulting in angioedema [42].",

If angioedema is secondary to mast cell activation, antihistamines, epinephrine, and corticosteroids may be effective. These will be less effective if bradykinin is implicated [50]. Cases of ACEI-induced angioedema can continue to occur for weeks despite discontinuing therapy [42]. If an ACEI is implicated, changing to angiotensin receptor blockers is associated with a 10% risk of angioedema recurrence [51]. When bradykinin-mediated angioedema is suspected and life threatening, bradykinin antagonists (e.g., icatibant) and C1 inhibitor concentrates (e.g., ecallantide, an inhibitor of kallikrein) may be effective, but their cost is prohibitive for routine use [42, 50, 52, 53]. Fresh frozen plasma contains angiotensin-converting enzyme and C1 esterase inhibitor and can reverse bradykinin-mediated angioedema [52, 53].\n",

DRESS can be easily missed as sometimes the eosinophilia is delayed and skin manifestations vary in severity from mild to severe [58]. Drugs associated with DRESS will usually have been prescribed for at least 2 weeks and include anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine and lamotrigine), sulfonamides, and antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) [59\u201361]. Discontinue all suspected drugs and treat supportively for organ failure and shock. Severe cases may require corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and/or antiviral drugs (e.g., ganciclovir) because DRESS can closely resemble herpes virus reactivation with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (\u201cVRESS\u201d) [57, 58].\n",

            "text": "Steven\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe and potentially life-threatening systemic disorders characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions, sometimes with necrosis. The extent of the surface area involved as well as the presence of necrosis helps to differentiate them. The lesions typically appear on extensor surfaces as well as the palms or the hands and soles of the feet. If there is epidermal and mucous membrane detachment and more than 30% of the body surface area is involved, TEN is implicated. Drugs implicated in SJS and/or TEN are pharmacologically diverse. Data mining implicates multiple pathways and suggests metabolizing enzymes, and transporters increase the intracellular tissue concentrations of reactive metabolites resulting in oxidative stress and the immunologic response. A disproportionate number of drugs associated with SJS were metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C9 and implicated transporters, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1), organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), and PEPT2 [62]. Drug targets highly associated with SJS included cyclooxygenases 1 and 2, carbonic anhydrase 2, and sodium channel 2 alpha which overlaps with results of other studies implicating antiepileptic drugs [63]. See Table 7 for drugs identified by the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) as being highly associated with SJS. The FDA has issued post-marketing safety alerts for acetaminophen (warning), phenytoin (modified warning), and carbamazepine (boxed warning). Critical care patients often require treatment with drugs highly associated with SJS; treatment involves discontinuing the suspected drug(s) and continuing care in facilities experienced in burn care.\n\n",

One review of QTc prolongation and TdP found 92.2% of TdP cases had at least one additional risk factor for QTc prolongation [70]. In reviews of thorough QT studies, while drug-associated QTc prolongation is associated with and considered a surrogate for predicting TdP, other intrinsic and extrinsic factors modify this risk. Bradycardia may be a major risk factor for TdP; TdP rarely occurs when HR is above 105 beats per minute [65]. A large case-crossover study of more than 17,000 patients who were prescribed with antipsychotic drugs found a drug\u2019s arrhythmogenic propensity was related to dose, blockade of potassium channel, and short-term usage [71]. For antipsychotic drugs, the strength of potassium blockade from lowest to highest was quetiapine, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine, clozapine, aripiprazole, prochlorperazine, olanzapine, zotepine, risperidone, thioridazine, ziprasidone, and haloperidol [71]. Beside potassium channel blockade, tachycardia associated with muscarinic blockade may be a risk factor for cardiotoxicity [72]; however, another large retrospective review of antipsychotic ingestions admitted to a medical toxicology service demonstrated tachycardia may be protective [65]. ICU drugs associated with QTc as listed by AZCERT are highlighted in Table 8.\n",

Propofol causes hypotension and bradycardia with an average maximum mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction of 29% after initiation, and severe hypotension develops in 26% of patients [97, 98].

Signs of PRIS\ninclude metabolic acidosis, lipemic serum, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, acute renal failure, hepatomegaly, and cardiac arrest [109]. PRIS has been associated with longer duration of infusion (>48 h) and faster infusion rates; other risk factors include increased catecholamine and glucocorticoid serum levels, head injury, and respiratory failure [109, 110]. An increase in triglyceride concentration is the most widely accepted marker of PRIS and may be explained by the fat content of the propofol emulsion [109, 110]. PRIS occurs in less than 5% of critically ill patients receiving propofol [109, 111]. One large retrospective study found a mortality of up to 40% in persons with PRIS; a review of FDA MedWatch data found mortality increased to 30% [109, 112]. A predictive tool was created and assigns points based on the presence of six factors: age \u226418, cardiac manifestations, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hypotension, and rhabdomyolysis. Mortality increases with each point from 24% to 83% [112]. If PRIS is suspected, propofol should be immediately discontinued. If the patient continues to decline, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has successful treated cardiac arrest [113, 114].\n",

At low doses (usual dosing range 0.01\u20130.1 microgram/(kg*min)), epinephrine predominantly targets \u03b2-adrenergic receptors; however, as the dose increases, more significant \u03b1-adrenergic effects appear [116]. Epinephrine has been associated with arrhythmias, decreased splanchnic blood flow, and increased blood lactate concentrations [119, 120]. Dopamine is an immediate precursor to norepinephrine in the synthetic catecholamine pathway [116]. Dopamine is an agonist at dopamine and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors at lower doses (<10 \u03bcg/(kg*min)), but with higher doses (10\u201320 \u03bcg/(kg*min)), \u03b1-adrenergic effects predominate [76]. The predominant dopaminergic effects observed with low doses of dopamine (<3 \u03bcg/kg/min) may preferentially dilate the hepatosplanchnic and renal circulations, but controlled trials have not shown clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction [121]. \u201cRenally dosed\u201d dopamine theoretically could worsen vasodilation resulting in hypotension, and many toxicology patients have minimal tolerance for worsened blood pressure. Dopamine may increase the incidence of arrhythmia when compared to norepinephrine [122]. Beta doses of dopamine (<10 \u03bcg/(kg*min)) may cause further vasodilatation and worsen hypotension. Therefore, for critically ill patients, dopamine therapy should be initiated at alpha receptor active doses (\u226510 \u03bcg/kg/min).",

Multifactorial etiology is usually suspected when drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) has occurred; however, single agents are not excluded. Platelets become targeted for destruction when a drug causes an antibody response. Depending on the molecular weight of the drug, this could be hapten dependent (e.g., penicillin) via covalent bonds to platelet glycoproteins or drug dependent (e.g., sulfonamide antibiotics), forming a complex or conformational change [133].

Antibiotics are associated with thrombocytopenia and, because of their prevalent use in ICU patients, are commonly implicated. Case\u2013control studies have associated quinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with thrombocytopenia [140, 141]. Sample size, exposure rates, and the potential effect of drug combinations likely limited their findings to only these drugs as there are over a thousand case reports of DITP. A database can be found online at http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/ditp.html. Other drugs to consider for ICU patients include antifungals, antivirals, anticonvulsants, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIA inhibitors and anticoagulants [141].\n",

            "text": "Heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is frequently used in immobile ICU patients. These drugs require careful consideration when evaluating a patient for thrombocytopenia. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type 2 occurs in 0.5\u20135% of patients receiving heparin products [142]. Typically this syndrome is characterized by a 50% or greater thrombocytopenia from baseline, occurring 5\u201315 days after initial heparin therapy. It can occur sooner if there was a prior exposure to heparin. Physiologically, IgG antibodies bind heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), forming complexes. These complexes bind platelets and result in thrombocytopenia. If thrombin is activated, thrombosis can occur. If HIT is considered, an HIT score should be calculated to guide therapy. If the HIT score is low (0\u20133 points), heparin therapy should be continued. For moderate or high scores, further testing is recommended, and the patient started on alternative anticoagulation until the diagnosis can be conclusively excluded. The absence of PF4 IgG antibodies has a high negative predictive value and rules out HIT; specificity is poor so positive tests require additional analysis [142\u2013145]. Serotonin release assay has high specificity (95\u2013100%) and positive predictive value for HIT; however, the availability is limited. Several days are often required for results. Once HIT has been confirmed, duration of therapy should be for 4 weeks or until baseline platelet counts are restored. In the presence of thrombosis, treatment should be continued for 4 months.",

Respiratory failure occurs when any part of this process becomes dysfunctional and is unable to maintain normal pH and/or adequate tissue oxygenation. Types of drug-induced respiratory disease can be subdivided based on location: airway (small and/or large), parenchymal/interstitial/pleural lung disease, pulmonary vasculopathy (e.g., noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or pulmonary arterial hypertension), neuromuscular respiratory disease (e.g., decreased respiratory drive), and/or circulation (e.g., methemoglobinemia) [161\u2013164]. Neurologic drug-induced respiratory disease is common in the ICU due to the number of sedatives and analgesics administered. When evaluating for drug-induced respiratory disease, initial attention to oxygenation, respiratory rate, and end tidal CO2 is helpful to determine if respiratory depression is present. Hypercarbia is more sensitive than hypoxia for early respiratory depression, and occasionally respiratory depression occurs in the absence of moderate to severe neurologic abnormality; naloxone and/or other antidote(s) administered can confirm and treat. If cyanosis and low pulse oximetry (90%) are present, arterial co-oximetry should be performed to evaluate for methemoglobinemia.",

Other considerations include drugs of abuse such as amphetamines and cocaine, anorexic or appetite suppressants, and other over-the-counter drugs such as nasal decongestants [203\u2013205]. Fenfluramine, an appetite suppressant, was withdrawn from the market and had been associated with PAH. Phenylpropanolamine, a nasal decongestant, was withdrawn because of an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and may have been a risk factor for PAH.\n",

For ICU patients, the costs could be even higher, and patients should be prescribed with bowel regimens to promote daily motility. When conservative measures have failed, opioid antagonists may be considered (LoE_I). Cost is preclusive to widespread implementation. Naloxone, naltrexone, and nalmefene are opioid antagonists with low systemic bioavailability because of first-pass metabolism [61]. If given in sufficient doses, naloxone crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier to reverse opioid analgesia; naloxone has a narrow therapeutic window when administered to treat opioid-induced constipation. Quaternary analogues of the opioid antagonists such as methylnaltrexone and alvimopan have greater polarity and lower lipid solubility; these analogues poorly cross the blood barrier.

ATN outcomes may be predicted based on the number of cells and casts visualized on the urinalysis [277].

ICU delirium can prolong mechanical ventilation and is associated with a threefold higher rate of re-intubation, an increased rate of ventilator-associated infections, prolonged hospital stays, and increased 1-year mortality [290, 291]. Delirium is defined as a fluctuating change in attention, cognition, consciousness, and/or perception and can be further categorized as hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed [290, 292]. Vanderbilt University Medical Center maintains the website www.icudelirium.org as a resource for delirium and includes screening and management tools for emergency department, ICU and non-ICU patients. When assessing delirium, workup for toxicologic or pharmacologic causes should occur simultaneously with evaluation for other causes as delirium is often multifactorial [293].

Certain withdrawal states not normally associated with delirium, when occurring concurrently with certain pathologies, may be considered. Examples include nicotine, opioid, and cannabis withdrawal. Nicotine withdrawal in the setting of brain injury has been associated with delirium [294]; however, larger review studies have not clearly implicated nicotine withdrawal with delirium in hospitalized patients [295]. Opioid withdrawal is not normally associated with delirium but in the ICU should be considered as a contributor, as opioid withdrawal can occur after only 5 days of continuous opioid analgesia and by day 9 occurred in 100% of patients [296]. Cannabis withdrawal is associated with anger, aggression, and irritability; performing urine drug screens at admission could help to identify patients at risk since this is the most common illicit drug used in the USA and withdrawal symptoms can persist for 3 or more weeks [297\u2013301]. Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal has been reported, but the propensity for delirium is not yet clear [302].",

Previous substance misuse should be considered, especially for dopaminergic drugs, as these drugs are associated with substance-induced psychosis and may be a function of the severity of use and dependence and persist for months after last use. Drugs implicated include alcohol, amphetamines, cannabimimetic agonists, cocaine, hallucinogens (e.g., methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA), and NMDA antagonists (e.g., phencyclidine and ketamine) [306]. Independent precipitating factors for delirium such as bladder catheters, fecal management systems, immobilizing therapies, and restraints should be avoided [290, 307, 308]. Major groups of ICU drugs associated with delirium that may be evaluated by a medical toxicologist include analgesics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, and sedative-hypnotics.\n",

Previous case reports have identified the following risk factors: being critically ill, reduced creatinine clearance, preexisting CNS conditions and/or damage to the blood\u2013brain barrier, concurrent use of other neurotoxic drugs, and dosing errors [330\u2013335]. Symptoms of beta-lactam neurotoxicity are secondary to impaired GABA-A transmission [335]. Cephalosporins with higher affinity for GABA-A receptors and those with higher CNS penetrance are more neurotoxic. Resulting clinical effects range from coma to agitation and can fluctuate with delirium, aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Cefazolin, cefepime, and ceftazidime may have higher risk for neurotoxicity, while cephalexin and ceftriaxone may be lower.

If benzodiazepine delirium is suspected, appropriately dosed flumazenil can diagnose and treat patients following intubation or after benzodiazepine overuse and following alcohol withdrawal with little if any risk for seizures or precipitating withdrawal [346, 349\u2013355]. Historically, patients with benzodiazepine dependence has been used as a contraindication to flumazenil, and a meta-analysis warns against the use of flumazenil, but when patients who received an initial flumazenil dose of 1 mg or more were excluded, there were no significant adverse events in either the placebo or flumazenil groups [356]. Benzodiazepine dependence is not an absolute contraindication to flumazenil (LoE II-1). Flumazenil, therefore, should be dosed at 0.2\u20130.3 mg if there are concerns about rapid awakening or, otherwise, 0.5 mg; if improvement is observed, discontinue benzodiazepines and repeat flumazenil as needed when symptoms recur (LoE II-1) [346]. If benzodiazepine withdrawal is suspected, replace with a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam or with phenobarbital (LoE III) [357]. Another option for patients at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal is a phenobarbital taper [358]; this may be beneficial for patients who received benzodiazepines with extended duration while mechanically ventilated.\n",

The incidence of delirium was 54% in dexmedetomidine vs 77% in midazolam-treated patients (P <0.001). There was no significant difference in time at targeted sedation level for 375 patients located in 68 centers in five countries who were treated in a double-blind, randomized trial [374]. Dexmedetomidine has caused hypotension during the initial bolus in between 25% and 56% of patients and, compared to benzodiazepines, may be more likely to cause bradycardia, which is the most significant ADR [373, 374]. Since dexmedetomidine is not usually associated with respiratory depression, it can be used to treat withdrawal syndromes in non-ventilated patients [374\u2013376]. Cost is a consideration when considering dexmedetomidine; compared to midazolam, dexmedetomidine lowered total ICU costs and decreased ventilator time and ICU length of stay [377]. However, for moderate to severe anticholinergic delirium, physostigmine would be expected to be a more cost-effective primary therapy; dexmedetomidine could be used as an adjunct to avoid higher doses of benzodiazepines, but additional studies are needed. An alternative to dexmedetomidine for pharmacies who restrict its use may be clonidine, and one study proposed the use of a short course of dexmedetomidine before transitioning to sublingual or orally administered clonidine [378]. The mechanism of these drugs differs such that the ratio of alpha-1 to alpha-2 may predispose clonidine to more hypotension and bradycardia and less sedation compared to dexmedetomidine, but the cost savings are difficult to ignore.",

For additional details refer to 10.1007/978-3-319-17900-1_7 Six percent of new-onset seizures and 9% of status epilepsy may be drug related [379]. Major classes of drugs associated with seizures include antidepressants, anticholinergics/antihistamines, and stimulants, but the clinician should also consider NSAIDS, beta-lactams, quinolones, and drug withdrawal [336, 380\u2013385]. Consider drugs previously prescribed that have not been continued in the ICU such as baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, zolpidem, and zopiclone; any drug acting at the GABA complex should be considered [386\u2013391]. ICU drugs cause seizures by inadequate inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA), excessive excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate), and/or interfering with sodium channels [385, 392]. Antimicrobials impair GABA-A transmission [335, 393]. Magnesium homeostasis may be associated with seizures as diuretics, proton pump inhibitor, and antimicrobials may decrease the seizure threshold [335, 393].",

            "text": "Multispecialty care teams consist of admitting physicians, consulting physicians, pharmacists, nurses, specialty therapists, care coordinators, and social workers. In the ICU, the value of the pharmacist is especially important. Pharmacists obtain medication histories; develop and manage policies and protocols for optimal patient care, drug expenditures, and cost avoidance (i.e., analgesia, anticoagulation, delirium, pharmacokinetic, sedation, and transfusion guidelines); optimize antimicrobial stewardship; respond to resuscitation events; verify accuracy of computerized order entry; educate other ICU personal; assist in discussing treatment modalities with patients and/or families; prospectively evaluate drug therapy; and monitor and identify ADRs [398\u2013410]. The impact of the clinical pharmacist in the ICU has significantly decreased ADRs, antimicrobial resistance, medication costs, transfusions, hemorrhage, ventilator days, and length of stay. Unfortunately, pharmacist services are not directly reimbursable; pharmacy departments receive funds from a hospital\u2019s general operating budget. Pharmacy departments are penalized when they increase the ratio of clinical pharmacists to occupied beds from 1/100 to 1/20, an increased expenditure which was shown to decrease ADRs by 48% [410]. The optimal pharmacist to patient ratio is unclear, but considering the services of a medical toxicologist are reimbursable, could a medical toxicologist enable a group of clinical pharmacists, thereby increasing the reimbursement of the pharmacy? Medical toxicologists, when available, are experts in pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics and should develop relationships with multidisciplinary teams to aid in the reduction of the incidence of ADRs, length of stay, and mortality.",

            "text": "Specialized treatment centers have been shown to improve care, especially for ICUs. Medical toxicology admitting services are not widely available, but there is great need as demonstrated by one large study of 3581 patients cared for primarily by toxicologists and non-toxicologists within the same hospital system as well as a third group of patients cared for by non-toxicologists outside of the hospital system. During the 2-year study period, there was a median savings of 1483 hospital days and $4.3 million dollars, as well as a significant decrease in mortality for patients cared for by toxicologists [414]. Extrapolating from other specialty data, when only specialists are allowed to admit and care for critically ill patients, length of stay and mortality in the ICU were shortened [413, 415]. All things considered, patients cared for by non-specialists have increased risk for extended length of stay and mortality, which suggests that medical toxicologists and critical care intensivists should remain involved in patient care potentially until hospital discharge. On admission, general recommendations may include holding any nonessential medication potentially resulting in drug\u2013drug or disease\u2013drug interactions; for example, many ICU patients may be started on antimicrobials, calcium channel blockers, and/or amiodarone, and these drugs increase concentration of simvastatin by inhibiting CYP3A4, thereby increasing drug levels resulting in an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and hepatotoxicity [416\u2013424]. Medical toxicologists may also provide daily recommendations for restarting or modifying home medications, as well as querying potential medication interactions, substance use disorders, and drug withdrawal. Until there are more admitting toxicology physicians, consultants should provide daily recommendations directly to the care team until the day of patient discharge. Interactive audio\u2013video telemedicine consultation may be an alternative when traditional bedside care is not possible as this service has been useful for other specialties [425].\n",
