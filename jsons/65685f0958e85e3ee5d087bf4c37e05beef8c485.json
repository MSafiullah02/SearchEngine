A similar result was previously reported in that 99% of participants reported wearing face masks when leaving home. [3] In addition, 85% of participants reported that they always or often wash their hands with soap. When the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong in 2003, the proportion of face mask use and washing hands among adults was 79% and 82% respectively.

The low volume of PA undertaken by participants may be due to social distancing (e.g., cancellation of all team sports training and competitions and the closure of public leisure facilities and gymnasiums) and the concerns of threat posed by COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the limited living space in Hong Kong, which is smaller than in other Asian cities including Tokyo and Singapore, may further restrict the opportunities of young adults to exercise at home. [14] The total time spent in SB during the waking day was significantly higher during COVID-19 than prior to the outbreak. Specifically, time spent in both TV/DVD and computer/paper work significantly increased while sitting time for transport decreased after COVID-19 outbreak. This may be partially explained by young adults engaging in social distancing by staying home and online teaching, which subsequently resulted in prolonged screen time, such as elevated time spent in watching TV, playing computer game and online teaching.
