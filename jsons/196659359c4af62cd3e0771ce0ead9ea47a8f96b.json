In our 'base intervention' scenario, demand for COVID-PROTECT peaks at 9,934 beds, and demand for COVID-CARE peaks at 1,366 beds. The intervention could reduce transmission by removing symptomatic individuals from the community, and preventing vulnerable individuals from being infected. This could lead to a reduction of 164 deaths, 2,624 hospital admissions, and 248 critical care admissions over this period. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of deaths is sensitive to transmission of COVID-19 in COVID-PROTECT. If COVID-PROTECT capacity is limited, scenario analyses show the benefit of prioritising people who are vulnerable to severe disease.",

The size and structure of the homeless population is difficult to estimate, not least because there are different types of homelessness. One estimate suggests there are 143,000 people in 'core homelessness' groups in England, which includes people sleeping rough, living in tents or cars, squatting, living in temporary homeless hostels, and sofa-surfing. 2 COVID-19 severity is associated with pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and cancer. [3] [4] [5] [6] These diseases are common among homeless people. For example, a survey of homeless people in London and Birmingham found that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease was double that of housed people of the same age and sex, while prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was ten times higher. 7 The high prevalence of long-term respiratory disease and alcohol and drug problems may also make it difficult for people experiencing homelessness to recognise or act on COVID-19 symptoms.",

Publicly-funded programmes in New York City and Los Angeles County are using hotel rooms to shelter homeless vulnerable people, and establishing separate \"medical sheltering\" facilities for those with symptoms. 8, 9 Similarly, health and housing authorities in England have developed a plan to provide single room own-bathroom accommodation to homeless adults in England. 10 This plan involves a triage process to identify people who either have symptoms of COVID-19, or are asymptomatic but at high risk of severe disease if they get COVID-19. People with symptoms will be offered 'COVID-CARE' accommodation, where testing, isolation, observation, medical support and escalation to hospital are provided. People who are asymptomatic but at high risk will be offered 'COVID-PROTECT' accommodation, which is designed to reduce the risk of becoming infected. Accommodation may be provided in hotels that are unoccupied during the pandemic or in single-room own-bathroom hostel accommodation. As of April 2020, the programme is at early stages of implementation across the UK. Asymptomatic people without specific vulnerabilities will receive information and advice. Figure 1 shows the envisaged intervention design. This study aims to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the homeless population of England, and estimate the potential reduction in mortality and healthcare use that could be achieved by the intervention. .

There are limited estimates of the number of people sleeping rough, and we used an official government count 13 in combination with an estimate of the number of people not captured by this count, producing an estimate of 10,748 people currently sleeping rough in England (see Supplementary Information for detail of this estimate). We did not have evidence of the structure of social mixing among people sleeping rough, and we created synthetic subgroups of sizes 1 to 100, where the group size was sampled with probabilities of the inverse of the size. This generated 530 subgroups of median size 8 (IQR 2-30), with approximately one-third of the population in 406 groups of size 1-33, one third in 80 groups of size 34-67, and the rest in 44 groups of size 67-100.

We assumed that 70% of eligible individuals are identified, of which 80% accept the intervention when offered (with the rest remaining in hostels or sleeping rough). Individuals who develop symptoms, either due to COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, are offered COVID-19 on the day they become symptomatic. To allow for this, we included typical durations of 'pre-symptomatic' and 'symptomatic' infectiousness in our model, in addition to the standard SEIR statuses. Susceptible individuals in COVID-PROTECT or COVID-CARE may acquire COVID-19 either through mixing with staff (with the same 'background' risk level as hostel and rough sleeping populations defined by the general population incidence, as described above) or a force of infection specific to COVID-PROTECT or COVID-CARE. Those who developed symptoms due to causes other than COVID-19 are returned to their origin after two days, on receiving test results. We assumed that moderate and severe cases in the community (i.e. those not identified by COVID-TRIAGE or who declined COVID-CARE) are admitted to hospital, while critical cases are admitted to an ITU. In COVID-CARE, mild and moderate cases are treated without hospital admission, severe cases are transferred to hospital, and critical cases to an ITU. If people develop symptoms while in COVID-PROTECT (which may be due to COVID-19 or other respiratory diseases), they are transferred to COVID-CARE.

If this is not done, the secondary attack rate within these settings can be very high, with more than 90% of residents affected in many hostels. With low incidence in the general population, larger hostels are likely to be at higher risk of an outbreak due to more contact with staff and a high probability of one case. Using our assumptions, the benefit of reducing outbreaks in the community outweighs the risks of transmission within COVID-PROTECT and COVID-CARE. This is reflected in data from the United States, where COVID-19 testing in homeless shelters in the United States found that shelters where two or more COVID-19 cases were reported in the preceding two weeks had much higher prevalence than shelters with one or zero reported prior cases (37% compared to 5%), 39 suggesting that outbreaks in these settings are an important element of COVID-19 risk for homeless populations.",
