These included, but were not limited to, ensuring physicians and HCW's have appropriate access to PPEs, providing Good Samaritan protections to physicians who practice across state lines, relief of unnecessary prior authorizations for care, small business relief for physician practices including small business loans, requesting disability protections for physicians treating Covid-19 patients, protecting physicians in Medicare alternative payment models from losses due to canceled cases and poor outcomes, suspension of the annual 2% Medicare budget sequester, suspension of MACRA quality reporting requirements, and provision of additional financial support to hospitals and physician practices adversely impacted by the COVID crisis. While many of these priorities were included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, other priorities will be included in upcoming additional Congressional legislation expected to be drafted in the next several months in the attempt to protect patients and providers from the ravages of the novel coronavirus-2019 pandemic.",

During STS advocacy in support of supply chain materials and legislative relief, additional advocacy has been conducted with the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to address the CMS financial reductions to the specialty of cardiothoracic surgery. STS is part of the Steering Committee for the Surgical Care Coalition, that will continue to formulate strategy and create a constructive appropriate response to the 2020 Final Payment Rule by CMS during the summer and fall of 2020.",
