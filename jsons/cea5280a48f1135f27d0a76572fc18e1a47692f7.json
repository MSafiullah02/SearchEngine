It acts as a community platform, where diverse users from geographically distributed locations can collaborate to seek and contribute multimedia contents of such diseases and related issues (breeding sites, etc.). Some of the essential services supported by the system are display of live hotspots, timeline, multimedia and Twitter-feed visualization, and location based services for both users and authorities. As a proof-of-concept, dengue disease was selected to build services using this platform to observe its capabilities.",

Dengue affects more than 50 million people in the world every year, in particular countries in the Asia-Pacific region that share more than 70% of the disease burden [1] . In Singapore, there were two serious outbreaks within the past 10 years, affecting 14,032 and 8,287 people in 2005 and 2007 respectively [2] [3] . Although various efforts were made to fight dengue in Singapore, the country remains vulnerable with an average number of 5, 000 dengue victims reported every year [4] . Unfortunately, there is no known vaccination or medicine that can prevent this infection. Hence preventing dengue, by destroying breading sites may be the best way to control this disease. Lack of information about breading site is one of the major problems in controlling these kinds of diseases. Authorities try to be aware about the real situation, but the resources are always a problem, especially in developing nations. Several applications have been developed to address this issue by introducing different information gathering and distribution mechanisms. However, one noticeable drawback of these systems is that they are more focusing on a selected subject, hence solutions have its own limitations related to that particular subject.",

In great measure, this innovation is attributed to the emergence of mobile phones and social media that are transforming the way public health is practiced. To reaffirm the preference for these technological preferences among our populations of interest, we surveyed middle-of-pyramid populations in three Asian countries -India, Singapore, and Vietnam -with a sample size of 1,000 from each country. Our survey found that mobile phones are among the top 3 preferred media for seeking health-related information, and that the demand for smartphones is poised to increase in India and Vietnam in the coming years. Similarly, social media are found to be of immense utility for keeping in touch with people, searching for information and sharing information. These findings, in concert with emerging needs in public health, lead us to identify the need for a system which enables citizens to track disease spread (search for information), contribute to surveillance efforts by engaging with health authorities (share information) and further disseminate health information through members of their social networks (keep in touch with people/share information) using simple mobile phones or smartphones.",

The system also creates an interactive channel between the general public and authorities. This also allows interactions with end-users in a structured-hierarchy or a flat structure depend on the situation. Hence this solution can be used to collect and distribute large range of data among diverse user groups. Instead of asking general public to engage, this platform gives opportunities for them to involve and solve problems themselves. Getting citizens more involved in the civic life and health of their communities is more effective in these kinds of situations, especially for resource limited environment. The bidirectional information floors are very important for such issues where it helps to have an equal and better understanding between the authorities and civilians, which will increase the civic engagement [5] in the long run.",

Hence experiments are continuing to improve the usage of interfaces [8] , and reduce the cost [9] . Further, visual health communication [10] is an emerging field because of its ability to help visualize the data in a friendly, interactive manner. Therefore, extensive studies have been done in order to create a health based communication platform and use of GIS when needed [9] . For fast spreading disease, GIS systems have been used to gather information to allow necessary actions to be taken quickly and decisively in a situation like SARS [11] .

In this instance, citizens can report breeding sites, mosquito bites and Dengue symptoms using their smartphones in image (Fig. 2) , video or text (Fig. 3) formats. These inputs are automatically reflected in the hotspot maps and can be accessed by health authorities for responding to citizen concerns as well as for initiating preventive actions in specific communities. The process is facilitated rapidly because of two reasons: a) mobile phone-based inputs from citizens are geo-tagged; and b) the Mo-Buzz system captures geo-spatial coordinates, time and date, and phone number of the contributor.",

Public health surveillance efforts are thus used to generate and deliver health communication messages. At a fundamental level, the system acts as a catalyst between the citizen and the public health system where the contributions of each stand to benefit the other.

Since the contents for this system are coming from the ground level and people who voluntarily contribute to the system, the content reflects the ground reality. Since dengue is a larger problem at the ground level, there is a better chance to have decent quality content maintained by its users. The civic engagement is one of the important aspects of the proposed system, which is essential when we need to collect large datasets. By going an extra mile, we hope that this engagement will solve some of the small problem that can be ended by themselves (or as a group), without the help of the authorities. System is also encouraging this by maintaining its content as open-content and by providing necessary functionalities. (Ex: through social ambassadors, forum, content validates etc.). One of the major challenges of a technology-driven participatory health system enterprise is validating the quality of informational inputs from citizens. Selected content of the system must undergo through a verification and filtering (ex: photos and videos) in order to remove unrelated contents. Our validation process is consistent in keeping with the core idea of using participatory media and crowd sourcing technologies. In that, we use people (individuals and health systems personnel) as validation experts. If users are self disciplined to provide only related information, then the system can avoid this and get rid of the delay and effort that needs to verify the information.",
