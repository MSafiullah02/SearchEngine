This clearly refers, inter alia, to cyber terrorism, yet links the offence exclusively to the safety of aircraft in flight. Article 2a) of the Convention provides that an aircraft is considered to be in flight at any time from the moment when all its external doors are closed following embarkation until the moment when any such door is opened for disembarkation. In the event of a forced landing, the flight would be deemed to continue until the competent authorities take over responsibility for the aircraft and for persons and property on board. For instance if, as a result of an act of cyber terrorism, a taxiing aircraft collided with an aircraft that had opened its doors for disembarkation, but passengers were still on board, such an act would not be considered an offence in terms of the passengers in the process of disembarkation. That is, the offender(s) would not be committing an offence under the convention either against the second aircraft or its disembarking passengers. Nonetheless, the Beijing Convention of 2010 is an initial step toward countering the threat of cyber terrorism, a threat directed often toward the target of air transport.",

A significant result of such collective efforts was the publication of the United Nations Manual on Cybercrime\n3 and 2001 United Nations Resolution3 exhorting States, in the context of an earlier United Nations Resolution on Millennium Goals,3 which recognized that the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communication-related technologies, are available to all, to ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technology. The Resolution also urged States to ensure the cooperation of law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of the criminal misuse of information technology, and that this should be coordinated among all concerned States. The Resolution further required information to be exchanged between States regarding the challenges faced in combating such criminal misuse and stated that law enforcement personnel should be trained and equipped to address any criminal misuse of information technology.",

The Resolution called upon mutual assistance regimes to ensure the timely investigation of the criminal misuse of information technology and the timely gathering and exchange of evidence in such cases. States were requested to make the public aware of the need to prevent and combat such criminal misuse. Finally, the Resolution called for information technology to be designed to help prevent and detect criminal misuse, trace criminals and collect evidence to the extent practicable, recognizing that countering the criminal misuse of information technology requires the development of solutions that take into account the protection of individual freedoms at the same time as their privacy and the preservation of the capacity of governments to fight such misuse.",

In the United States, this Convention was ratified by then President Bush on 22 September 2006 and entered into force on 1 January 2007. The main focus of this Convention is the risk that computer networks and electronic information might be used for committing criminal offences and that evidence relating to such offences may be stored in and transferred over these networks. States Parties to the Convention therefore expressed their view in a Preambular Clause that cooperation between States and private industry in combating cyber crime was necessary and that there was a need to protect legitimate interests in the use and development of information technology. The intent of the Convention falls under three goals:Harmonizing domestic criminal substantive law elements of offences and connected provisions in the area of cyber crime;Providing for domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offences as well as other offences committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; andSetting up a fast and effective regime of international cooperation.\n",

Other provisions call for States Parties to adopt legislative or other measures to counter illegal inception of transmission of computer data, data interception and exchange interception.3 Of particular significance to aviation is Article 7 on the alteration of data and forgery, which requires each Party to adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the input, alteration, deletion, or suppression of computer data, resulting in inauthentic data, with the intent that such data be considered or acted upon for legal purposes as if it were authentic, regardless of whether or not the data is directly readable and intelligible.

The PKD has been developed using the quantum cryptography technique, intended to eradicate vulnerabilities to fraud in the use of digitally stored data. Quantum cryptography transmits information along cables by polarized photons rather than electronic signals. These photons are tiny particles of light sensitive enough that they immediately become corrupted when intercepted, thus rendering their message unintelligible and alerting both sender and recipient to the attempt at fraud or spying. The use of the PKD technique in passports provides a good example. In this case, the PKD is designed and proposed for use by customs and immigration authorities who verify biometric details in an electronic passport. The PKD is based on cryptography, an already viable tool that is now considered by the aviation community as a fail-safe method for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of passport information.",

Biometrics that have been successfully used and are the most appropriate for this scientific process are facial recognition, fingerprinting and iris-recognition. Identification through biometrics involves four steps: first, the capture or acquisition of a biometric sample; second, the extraction or conversion of the sample into an intermediate form; and third, the creation of templates of this data for storage; and fourth, the comparison of the information offered in a travel document with that which is stored in the template.",

The provision goes on to require the agent of the State who intercepts a private communication to, as soon as practicable in the circumstances, destroy any recording of the private communication obtained during an interception, any full or partial transcript of the recording and any corresponding notes, if nothing in the private communication suggests that bodily harm, attempted bodily harm or threatened bodily harm has occurred or is likely to occur.

The legal possibility of imposing liability upon a State wherever an official could be linked to that State encourages a State to be more cautious of its responsibility in controlling those responsible for carrying out tasks for which the State could be ultimately held responsible. In the same context, the responsibility of placing mines was attributed to Albania in the Corfu Channel case where the court attributed to Albania the responsibility, since Albania was known to have knowledge of the placement of mines although it did not know who exactly carried out the act. It is arguable that, in view of the responsibility imposed upon a State by the Chicago Convention on the provision of air navigation services, the principles of immutability in State responsibility could be applied to an instance of an act or omission of a public or private official providing air navigation services.",

Accordingly, biometric identification of a person either correctly establishes his identity as being consistent with what is claimed in the passport he is holding or brings to bear the possibility that the person carrying a particular passport is an imposter. A biometric is a measurable, physical characteristic or personal behavioral trait used to recognize the identity, or verify3 the claimed identity of a person. In the modern context, biometrics are usually incorporated in an MRTD with a view to achieving five goals, the first of which is global interoperability3 enabling the specifications of biometrics deployed in travel documents across the world to be applied and used in a universally operable manner. This is a critical need if the smooth application of biometric technology were to be ensured across borders. The second goal is to ensure uniformity within States in specific standard setting by States authorities who deploy biometrics in travel documents issued by them. The third is technical reliability, where States are required to ensure that technologies used in deploying biometrics are largely failure-proof and of sufficient quality and standard to ensure a State immigration authority reading documents issued by other States can determine that the details in the document do provide accurate verification of facts. Fourthly, the technology used has to be practical and not give rise to the need for applying disparate types of support technology at unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the user. The final goal is to ensure that the technology used will be sufficiently up to date for at least 10 years and also be backwardly compatible with new techniques to be introduced in the future.",

This measure not only ensures that the holder of the document is the legitimate claimant to that document and to whom it was issued, but also enhances the efficacy of any advance passenger information (API)3 system used by the State to pre-determine the arrivals to its territory. Furthermore, matching biometric data presented in the form of the traveler with the data contained in the template accurately ascertains as to whether the travel document has been tampered with or not. A three way check, which matches the traveler\u2019s biometrics with those stored in the template carried in the document and a central database, is an even more efficacious way of determining the genuineness of a travel document. The final and most efficient biometric check is when a four way determine is effected, were the digitized photograph is visually matched (non electronically) with the three way check described above.3 In this context, it is always recommended that the traveler\u2019s facial image (conventional photograph) should be incorporated in the travel document along with the biometric templates in order to ensure that his identity could be verified at locations where there is no direct access to a central database or where the biometric identification process has not entered into the legal process of that location.",

In turn, and as already discussed, the issue of responsibility hinges on knowledge, complicity and condonation of a State. The responsibility of a State is determined by the quantum of proof available that could establish intent or negligence of the State, which in turn would establish complicity or condonation on the part of the State concerned. One way to determine complicity or condonation is to establish the extent to which the State adhered to the obligation imposed upon it by international law and whether it breached its duty to others. In order to exculpate itself, the State concerned will have to demonstrate that either it did not tolerate the offence or that it ensured the punishment of the offender. Brownlie is of the view that proof of such breach would lie in the causal connection between the offender and the State.3 In this context, the act or omission on the part of a State is a critical determinant particularly if there is no specific intent.3 Generally, it is not the intent of the offender that is the determinant but the failure of a State to perform its legal duty in either preventing the offence (if such was within the purview of the State) or in taking necessary action with regard to punitive action or redress.3\n",

Thirdly, since the State as an abstract entity cannot perform an act in itself, the imputability or attribution of State responsibility for acts of its agents has to be established through a causal nexus that points the finger at the State as being responsible. For example, The International Law Commission, in Article 4 of its Articles of State Responsibility states that the conduct of any State organ which exercises judicial, legislative or executive functions could be considered an act of State and as such the acts of such organ or instrumentality can be construed as being imputable to the State.

Falsification of a national passport, whatever its country or nationality might be, by a member of the Israeli intelligence services brings to bear issues that are much more serious than mere breaches of diplomatic courtesy or relations. Under the theory of condonation any government involved would be seriously implicated, were it to turn out that it was aware that falsified travel documents were being used by its security agency as has been suggested by some.",

The explosion is believed to have been caused by the detonation of a plastic explosive concealed in a portable cassette player/radio. The ICJ noted that it was a general principle of international law that no State could be compelled to extradite its nationals and that the State concerned held the prerogative of trying the accused of a crime in its own territory. The ICJ was encumbered with the discussion as to whether the Court had jurisdiction over a United Nations Security Council Resolution on the issue.

What is most important is to establish a global security culture that ensures the cooperation of the 190 ICAO member States by working in harmony. A perceived inadequacy of the global framework of aviation security is the lack of an implementation arm. ICAO has taken extensive measures to introduce relevant international conventions as well as Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention. There is also a highly classified Aviation Security Manual developed by ICAO which is provided to States. Additionally, the Organization provides focused security training courses to its member States. However, ICAO\u2019s role is largely confined to rule making and the provision of guidance, bringing to bear the need for an aviation security crisis management team on a global scale that could work towards effectively precluding acts of terrorism.",

The first step toward achieving this objective is the realization by the aviation community of new and emerging threats to aviation and the need to share information. Since the event, several countries have imposed stringent security standards at airports and initiated inter-governmental meetings to discuss closer cooperation among States in the hope that such measures will effectively respond to the threat.

The Air Transport Association (ATA), in its 2002 State of the United States Airline Industry Statement, advised that, in the United States, the combined impact of the 2001 economic downturn and the precipitous decline in air travel following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States resulted in devastating losses for the airline industry which are likely to exceed $7 billion and continue through 2002.3 Of course, the overall picture, which portended a certain inevitable gloom for the air transport industry, was not the exclusive legacy of United States\u2019 carriers. It applied worldwide, as was seen in the abrupt downfall of air traffic globally during 2001. The retaliation by the world community against terrorism, which is an ongoing feature in world affairs, increased the airline passenger\u2019s fear and reluctance to use air transport. In most instances in commercial aircraft purchasing, air carriers cancelled or postponed their new aircraft requisition orders. Many carriers, particularly in developing countries, were seen revisiting their cost structures and downsizing their human resource bases.

From the isolated incidents of the 1960s, international terrorism has progressed to becoming a concentrated assault on nations and organizations that are usually susceptible to political conflict, although politics is not always the motivation of the international terrorist. International terrorism has been recognized to engulf acts of aggression by one State on another as well as by an individual or a group of individuals of one State on another State. The former typifies such acts as invasion, while the latter relates to such individual acts of violence as hijacking and the murder of civilians in isolated instances. In both instances, the duties of the offender-State have been emphatically recognized. Such duties are to condemn such acts and take necessary action.",

Typical examples of this kind of terrorism are the spreading of false propaganda and the invocation of threats which unhinge both the nation or a group of persons against whom the threats are carried out and the nations in which such acts are said to be committed. There have been instances in the past where export consumer commodities of a nation such as food items have been claimed to be poisoned in order that foreign trade between nations be precluded. Although such acts are devoid of actual physical violence, they tend to unhinge the economic stability of a nation particularly if such nation depends solely on the export of the item in question. In such instances, international terrorism assumes proportions of great complexity and succeeds at least temporarily to disrupt the infrastructural equilibrium of the nation against which such threat is aimed. The government concerned is immediately placed on the defensive and attempts counter-propaganda. In spreading propaganda of this nature, the media is the terrorist\u2019s best friend. He uses the media of television and radio as a symbolic weapon to instil fear in the public and to cripple the persons or government against which his attack has been aimed. The effect of publicity on people is truly tangible, whether it pertains to the statement of facts or whether it relates to the issuance of threats. Primarily, media terrorism creates an emotional state of apprehension and fear in threatened groups and secondly, draws world attention to the existence of the terrorists and their cause.

We have not had the misfortune of seeing all terrorist groups band together to work as a composite element. This has not happened for the reason that diverse ideologies and religions have kept each group separate. Nevertheless, there is a strong identity bond between groups and even evidence that one helps the other with training and military aid, even though their causes are quite different. The link between terrorist groups is an important consideration for the world as close association between groups could strengthen a weak force and nurture it to maturity. In addition, strong and established terrorist organizations, under cover of burgeoning groups, could carry out campaigns which would cover their tracks and make identification difficult. In most instances, this was found to be true and investigation reveals that a small group, not too significant at that time to take account of, has been responsible for an act or acts whereas later it is revealed that a much stronger group had masterminded the offenses for its benefit. Another important feature of the growing incidence of international terrorism is the assistance the terrorists receive from the advancement of technology in communication, the manufacture of sophisticated weaponry and the proliferation of nuclear armament. In today\u2019s context, terrorism has blown to unmanageable proportions with the use of advanced weapons of destruction. Arms control plays a vital role in the control of aggression and it naturally follows that terrorism too benefits from the availability of new modes of aggression. The vulnerability of the international community has been mainly brought upon by the paucity of adequate security measures to prevent nuclear theft. With the growth of the nuclear power industry, developed nations exposed themselves to the vulnerability of theft by power groups, in whose hands nuclear weapons act as threats of destruction. The most effective counter measure that can be taken in this instance against the threat of nuclear theft is to take such effective measures as are necessary to protect the stored items and to make known to the terrorist the high risk involved in an attempt to steal such material. Ideally, any hope of theft must be obviated. This can be achieved by strengthening governmental security.",

The futility of attempting to wipe out terrorism by the use of military force or the threat of general sanction on an international level is apparent. The terrorist has to be shown that any attempt at terrorist activity would cause him and his cause more harm than good. Deterrence in this context attains fruition when effective punitive sanctions are prescribed and carried out whilst simultaneously denying the terrorist his demands. In both instances the measures taken should be imperatively effective. It is not sufficient if such measures are merely entered into the statute books of a State or incorporated into international treaty.

Perhaps the most effective method of countering terrorism is psychological warfare. The terrorist himself depends heavily on psychology. His main task is to polarize the people and the establishment. He wants popular support and a sympathetic ear. He wants a lot of people listening and watching, not a lot of people dead. Counter measures taken against a terrorist attack, be it hostage taking, kidnapping or a threat of murder, should essentially include an effective campaign to destroy the terrorist\u2019s credibility and sincerity in the eyes of the public. Always, the loyalty of the public should be won over by the target and not by the terrorist. It is only then that the terrorist\u2019s risk outweighs the benefits he obtains. To achieve this objective it must be ensured that the terrorist receives publicity detrimental to him, showing the public that if the threatened person, group of persons or State comes to harm, the terrorist alone is responsible. Therefore, the most practical measures that could be adopted to deter the spread of terrorism can be accommodated in two chronological stages:Measures taken before the commission of an offense such as the effective imposition and carrying out of sanctions and the refusal to readily comply with the demands of the terrorist;Measures taken after the commission of the act such as the skilful use of the media to destroy the credibility of the terrorist cause and to convince the people that the responsibility for the act devolves at all stages solely upon the terrorist.\n",

Negotiation with the terrorist in particular has to be done by professionals specially trained for the task. A fortiori, the media has to be handled by specialists with experience. Things would be much more difficult for the terrorist if these were done. The greatest problem of deterrence is the pusillanimity of the international community in the face of terrorism and the feeble response offered by States as a composite body. The reasons for this hesitation on the part of the international community to adopt effective measures against international terrorism are by no means inexplicable. When one state supports a revolutionary cause which is aimed against another, it is quite natural that the terrorist is aware of the support he is capable of obtaining from at least one part of the already polarized world.

This right is entrenched in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and is accepted today as constituting an obligation on all member States to recognize the legally and morally binding nature of the Declaration. Therefore the destruction of human life and the restriction of liberty are acts committed against international law and order. International terrorism destroys both life and liberty. Indeed there need be no doubt in our minds that international terrorism is illegal. To begin with, there should be more awareness in the world today that every human being has the inherent right to life and that the right is protected by law. Any act of terrorism being illegal, becomes subject to law and its punitive sanctions. However, in this instance, unlike in a simple instance of murder where sanction itself may act as a deterrent, the two forces of law and sanction are not sufficient to curb terrorism. The international community should realize that the solution to terrorism lies rather in its prevention than in its cure. Therefore the problem has to be approached solely on the basis that the terrorist on the one hand has to be dissuaded that his act may not succeed while on the other he has to be persuaded that even if he succeeded in committing the act of terrorism, it would not achieve for him the desired results. The philosophy of warfare against terrorism is therefore based on one single fact \u2013 that of convincing the terrorist that any attempt at committing a terrorist act would be fruitless and would entail for him unnecessary harm. This simple philosophy should be adopted gradually in stages with the sustained realization that each measure taken is as important as the next and that all measures should be adopted as a composite element and not as those that are mutually exclusive.",

There should be more awareness of the threat of terrorist activity particularly in international airports and international bus and train terminals where travel documents should be checked and passengers double checked. Electronic surveillance of passports and other documents have proved to be effective methods of deterrence in this context. Perhaps the most important facet of surveillance is the use of personnel who do not reveal their identity to the public but unobtrusively mingle with the crowds. This category of person can easily detect an irregularity without arousing suspicion and without alarming the common man. It is recommended that together with the armed personnel there should also be trained personnel who in all informality may work together with the security forces in such instances. Another significant requirement is the support of the people. The media should be made maximum use of to educate the common man as to how to react in an emergency and also to be totally distrustful of the terrorist whose acts are calculated to evoke sympathy.

Furthermore, this provision raises an important issue. One could argue that the exclusivity of \u201csafety in flight\u201d may unduly restrict the scope of this provision.

These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days.

Until recently in the United States of America, most biological defence strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than looking after ordinary people in cities. In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d (non-health-care) data sources.

The other suspect repeated this ritual, and between them the two men went through this performance about a dozen times before following a third man up the street. The officer, thinking they were preparing to commit a misdemeanour and might therefore be armed, confronted the men, asked their names and patted them down, thereby discovering pistols the plaintiff and his companion. In affirming Terry\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, the Supreme Court concluded that where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may ensue and that the person with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.

It gave way, in the 1960s and 1970s to a post-modernist era of recognition of the individual as a global citizen whose interests at public international law were considered paramount over considerations of individual State interests.",

In its Preamble, the Convention enunciates a message of peace through aviation. It makes mention of the future development of international civil aviation being able to help preserve friendship and understanding among the nations of the world, while its abuse (i.e. abuse of future development of international civil aviation) can become a threat to \u201cthe general security\u201d. By \u201cgeneral security\u201d the Chicago Conference meant the prevention of threats to peace. These words have been interpreted in the widest possible sense by the Assembly of the ICAO3 at its various sessions to cover instances of social injustice such as racial discrimination as well as threats to commercial expediency achieved through civil aviation. The 15th session of the ICAO Assembly adopted Resolution A15-7 (Condemnation of the Policies of Apartheid and Racial Discrimination of South Africa) where the Resolution urged South Africa to comply with the aims and objectives of the Chicago Convention, on the basis that the apartheid policies constitute a permanent source of conflict between the nations and peoples of the world and that the policies of apartheid and racial discrimination are a flagrant violation of the principles enshrined in the Preamble to the Chicago Convention.3\n",

However, in some cases of extraordinary rendition, unfortunately, the converse has happened and in the instances already mentioned the attendant circumstances have even caused strife among nations. Arguably, the most dangerous risk of arrest of an innocent airline passenger suspected of terrorist activity would arise from profiling. It is an incontrovertible fact that profiling is a useful tool in the pursuit of the science of criminology. Profiling is also a key instrument in a sociological context and therefore remains a sustained social science constructed through a contrived process of accumulation of single assumptions and propositions that flow to an eventual empirical conclusion. However, profiling raises well reasoned latent fears when based on a racial platform. Jonathan Turley, Professor of Constitutional Law at George Washington University, in his testimony before a United States House of Representatives Committee on Airport Security regarding the use of racial profiling to identify potentially dangerous travellers observed:[R]acial profiling is to the science of profiling as forced confessions are to the art of interrogation. Like forced confessions, racial profiling achieves only the appearance of effective police work. Racial profiling uses the concept of profiling to shield or obscure a racist and unscientific bias against a particular class or group. It is the antithesis of profiling in that it elevates stereotypes over statistics in law enforcement.3\n\n",

This by no means implies that racial profiling is a desirable practice. On the contrary, it is a demeaning experience to the person subjected to the process and a de facto travel restriction and barrier.

The question arises as to how an international treaty, which on the one hand prescribes that it applies only to civil aircraft, turns around and prescribes a rule for state aircraft. Article 3 (c) effectively precludes relief flights over the territory of a State by state aircraft if the State flown over or landed upon does not give authorization for the aircraft to do so.

In such circumstances any determination of the category of the aircraft concerned must be made taking into account all pertinent circumstances of the flight. Perhaps the most fundamental difference between the operation of civil and military aircraft lay in the fact that, although they were expected to share the same skies, the procedures by which they did this varied greatly. Civil aircraft depended entirely on predetermined flight paths and codes of commercial conduct which varied depending on aircraft type and types of traffic carried, whereas military aircraft operated in line with the exigency of a situation and were not necessarily always guided by predetermined flight paths. This dichotomy led to the adoption of Resolution A10-19 by the Tenth Session of the ICAO Assembly in 1956. The Assembly Resolution, while recognizing that the skies (airspace) as well as many other facilities and services are commonly shared between civil and military aviation, focused on ICAO\u2019s mandate to promote safety of flight3 and reinforced the thrust of Article 3(d) of the Chicago Convention.

Between 1919 and 1922, the relationship between civil and military aviation was debated at length by three international committees of air experts which met, respectively, in Paris, Geneva and Washington. They concluded independently that no means could be devised to prevent the conversion of civil aviation to military purposes, which would not at the same time prejudice the development of civil aviation. In 1920, the Supreme War Council of the Paris Peace Conference asked one of these committees, the Aeronautical Advisory Commission to the Peace Conference, which had given its opinion in 1919, to draw up rules to distinguish between civil aviation and the military and naval aviation forbidden by the Peace Treaties. The Commission, referring to its 1919 report, replied that the task was impossible. The Supreme Council insisted that the rules be drawn up; after several months of debates, the Commission submitted what is known as \u201cThe Nine Rules\u201d of 1922, for differentiating between military and civil aircraft.

The question whether a particular insurance coverage is rendered invalid in such situations is primarily a private law matter of the construction and interpretation of the insurance contract. Unless the contract has an exclusion clause which specifically makes reference to the classification in Article 3 of the Chicago Convention (e.g. loss of coverage where the operation is of a state (or civil) aircraft as defined in the Chicago Convention), where the Convention will have no bearing on the contract, and the issue of the loss of insurance coverage becomes moot, the Chicago Convention\u2019s application to the insurance contract would prevail. Frequently, the policy will exclude usage of the aircraft for any purpose other than those stated\u201d in a Schedule; among the exclusions would be any use involving abnormal hazards. Nearly every aviation hull and liability policy now excludes losses due to war, invasion, hostilities, rebellion. etc., although insurance to cover such losses can usually be obtained by the payment of a higher premium. However, the instances mentioned do not require a determination of whether the aircraft is considered to be state or civil under the Chicago Convention.",

Would civil or military investigative and judicial processes be applied, for example. in the case of an accident? The answer would depend largely on the domestic laws of the State concerned. The fundamental principle is stated in Article 1 of the Convention: every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. Furthermore, subject to the provisions of the Convention, the laws and regulations of a contracting State relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or the operation and navigation of such aircraft within its territory, shall be complied with by (civil) aircraft of other contracting States, upon entering or departing from or while in the territory of that A fortiori, state aircraft are also subject to the laws of the subjacent State.",

They can voluntarily (through their legislation) so apply\u2019 these provisions. Sometimes, the legislation specifies a different procedure in relation to military aircraft only; all other aircraft, including those used in customs or police services, are treated as civilian in this regard. In the case of other incidents, where for example the requisite over-flight permission has not been obtained by a state aircraft, which is then forced to land and charges brought against the crew, again the answer would depend on the domestic laws of the over-flown State and the factual circumstances. It is impossible to give a definitive answer in a vacuum. but it is the view of the Secretariat that the classification of an aircraft as \u201cstate\u201d aircraft under the Convention does not necessarily mean that military laws and procedures of a State would apply to that aircraft or its crew. The current or any different classification of aircraft under the Convention would not be determinative whether a particular State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, would make that aircraft and/or its crew subject to civil or military laws and regulations. As a matter of practice States usually apply military rules and processes to military aircraft and personnel only. Paragraph 2.1.3 above shows that at the international level, attempts to arrive at a common, acceptable definition of military aircraft have met with a singular lack of success.",

The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (No. I) applies to \u201cpersons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civil members of military aircraft crews \u2026 provided they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany\u201d and to \u201c\u2026 the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict \u2026\u201d The same provisions are found in Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of the Armed Forces at Sea (No. 2) and the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (No. 3). The Geneva Conventions, and in particular the provisions quoted above, do not link their own scopes of applicability to the determination under the Chicago Convention of the status of an aircraft. The Conventions of 1949 refer to civil and military aircraft, but not to these terms as \u201cdefined\u201d under Chicago. Consequently, the provisions of the Chicago Convention does not, and cannot, determine whether and to what extent the flight crew of an aircraft is given protection by these Conventions.",

For example, flight logs, which are kept by aviation authorities for years have been used to trace the transportation of particular prisoners from one jurisdiction to another.3 The most significant role played by aviation, however, is in assisting the world community in realizing that current political and diplomatic problems mostly emerge as a result of the inability of the world to veer from its self serving concentration on individual perspectives to collective societal focus. This distorted approach gives rise to undue emphasis being placed on rights rather than duties; on short-term benefits rather than long-term progress and advantage and on purely mercantile perspectives and values rather than higher human values.",
