The newly discovered virus, causing a similar infection (SARS-CoV), was initially named as nCoV 2019 (January 2020) and was later called COVID-19 in February 2020. The WHO and the China Bureau had announced the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been isolated from the patients suffering from pneumonia. As of February 12, 2020, a total of 43,103 cases of infection and 1,018 deaths have been recorded [14] . Thousands of human infections have been confirmed in China, along with many exported cases throughout the globe [15]. SARS-CoV-2 was found to infect more human beings than either of its predecessors that include the SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) [16] . Numerous factors have contributed to the fast spread of this virus, with the main reason being the densely populated Wuhan, which is the capital city of China's Hubei province, with more than 11,000,000 population. Because Wuhan is a transportation hub, there was an increased chance of person-to-person transmission and the possibility of exporting cases to other places [14] .",

The viability of SARS-CoV was found to decrease after 24 hours at 38\u00b0C and 80-90% relative humidity [31] . The virus may remain viable on distinct surfaces for 48 hours at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, even though viability reduced to 8 hours at 30\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity conditions [3, 32] .

            "text": "The SARS-CoV disease may precipitate nosocomial transmission, and, therefore, it is important to enhance ordinary infection control measures in healthcare settings. Healthcare facilities must additionally ensure \"respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette\" strategy to restrict the nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. To contain the spread of respiratory secretions, all people with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection, irrespective of presumed cause, have to be advised to cover the nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing. People must be advised to use tissues to contain respiratory secretions and get rid of them within the nearest waste disposal container. They have to also be sensitized about hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated items and substances. Healthcare centers have to ensure the availability of materials (tissues and no-contact receptacles for used tissue disposal, provide conveniently placed dispensers for alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and provide cleaning soap and disposable towels for handwashing) for adhering to respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette in waiting areas for patients and site visitors [44] .",

Also, it can be transmitted from bats to humans, which confirms its zoonotic importance. COVID can present various clinical signs that include high fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, diarrhea, myalgia or fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It can be diagnosed by clinical findings and laboratory tests including serology, viral isolation, and molecular techniques. COVID has great public health and economic impact.
