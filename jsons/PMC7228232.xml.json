            "text": "During the past decade, serious outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have occurred in many parts of the world, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) in Saudi Arabia (2012\u2013present), Ebola in West Africa (2014\u20132016) (Ajisegiri, Chughtai, & MacIntyre, 2018), Zika virus in Brazil (2015\u20132016) (Campos, Bandeira, & Sardi, 2015), and the plague in Madagascar in 2017 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2017). The default assumption of most outbreaks and epidemics is that they are naturally caused (MacIntyre & Engells, 2016), and public health culture and practice do not routinely consider unnatural causes such as bioterrorism or biowarfare (MacIntyre, 2015a). All category A bioterrorism agents except smallpox also occur in nature. Therefore, epidemics caused by bioterrorism, including by new or engineered pathogens, may not be recognized as unnatural (MacIntyre et al., 2017). Bioterrorism\u2010associated outbreaks cannot be identified unless specifically considered, and even so may be difficult to detect (MacIntyre, 2015b; MacIntyre & Engells, 2016; Treadwell, Koo, Kuker, & Khan, 2003). Therefore, in an era of accessible and expanding technology in genetic engineering and synthetic biology (MacIntyre et al., 2017), it is important to discern unnatural from natural outbreaks during outbreak investigation.",

When applied to 11 historically natural and unnatural disease outbreaks by the United States (U.S.) Army (Dembek, Pavlin, & Kortepeter, 2007), it had high specificity (100%) but relatively low sensitivity (38%) for detecting bioterrorism (MacIntyre & Engells, 2016). The GFT was recalibrated in 2017 by changing criteria, weights, and threshold to achieve 100% sensitivity in detection of unnatural outbreaks, and the modified GFT (mGFT) was validated against historical data (Chen, Chughtai, & MacIntyre, 2018).

As of December 31, 2018, a total of 1,901 human cases, including 732 deaths (case fatality rate: 39%), have been reported in Saudi Arabia by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2018a), accounting for more than 80% of global cases (FluTrackers, 2018). There have been unanswered questions and various explanations of the source of MERS\u2010CoV, transmission modes, and unusual epidemic pattern. While camels have been identified as a host of the virus (Azhar et al., 2014; Dudas, Carvalho, Rambaut, & Bedford, 2018; Mohd, Al\u2010Tawfiq, & Memish, 2016), over 50% of human cases have no identified exposure to animals, let alone camels (Chen, Chughtai, Dyda, & MacIntyre, 2017). No drug is currently available against MERS\u2010CoV (Modjarrad, 2016). Several vaccine candidates are in development, of which the GLS\u20105300 vaccine candidate was in human clinical trial (Modjarrad et al., 2019). The aim of this study was to apply the mGFT to MERS\u2010CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia for risk analysis, and to evaluate the mGFT in comparison with original GFT.",

This can include measures which make detection and identification more difficult or which increase the virulence, environmental stability and resistance to prophylactic and therapeutic measures\u201d (Grunow & Finke, 2002). \nThe MERS\u2010CoV is classified as a bioterrorism category C agent by the Center of Disease Control (CDC, 2018), which includes newly emerged infections, and is the \u201cthird highest priority agent that could be engineered for mass dissemination because of availability, ease of production, and dissemination, and potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact\u201d (CDC, 2018);The origin of MERS\u2010CoV is unknown. It was first documented in humans in the Middle East in 2012 (FluTrackers, 2012), resulting in 1903 laboratory\u2010confirmed human cases worldwide as of December 31, 2018 (FluTrackers, 2018). It is now known that MERS\u2010CoV strains have circulated in animal hosts such as bats and dromedary camels in the Middle East and East Africa for decades (Cui, Eden, Holmes, & Wang, 2013; Mohd et al., 2016) before the first human case that was identified in 2012 (Chen, Chughtai, Dyda et al., 2017). If naturally occurring, presumably a genetic mutation enabled the species jump to humans in 2012. The phylogenetic evolution of MERS\u2010CoV prior to and after the species jump from animal to human shows the high rate of evolution (1.42 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site per year) (Kim, Park, Bae, & Park, 2019). However, the exact routes of transmission of MERS\u2010CoV in animals and humans are still puzzling.In a nosocomial outbreak in Al Ahsa (April\u2013May 2013), a total of 23 cases, with a classic epidemic curve, were confirmed. A single branching chain of person\u2010to\u2010person transmission was assumed. However, the phylogenetic analysis (Assiri et al., 2013; Cotten et al., 2013) demonstrated that multiple genetic strains were infecting patients during this outbreak. At least five of 13 transmissions within the hospital could not be explained by person\u2010to\u2010person transmission (MacIntyre, 2014). This evidence of multiple independent introductions of infection and several genetically related but distinct strains in a single hospital outbreak is unusual. Whether multiple people had the same animal exposure in the community prior to presenting to hospital, no evidence of this was found or described.\n",

However, MERS\u2010CoV has been limited largely to the Middle East, with a notable absence of satellite epidemics, except for South Korea (MacIntyre, 2014). A modeling study also showed that with the estimated R\n0 of MERS\u2010CoV, satellite epidemics should have occurred in other countries following mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca (Gardner et al., 2014). Yet no such satellite epidemics have arisen following Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages. In addition, based on frequency of air travel to Saudi Arabia, the country at the highest risk of an importation of MERS\u2010CoV, India, has not seen a case, yet a country which is not in the top 10 at\u2010risk countries, South Korea, has seen a large epidemic (Gardner, Chughtai, & MacIntyre, 2016).

For example, the large salmonellosis outbreak in Oregon in 1984, which was caused by Rajneesh cult who deliberately released salmonella in salad bars in 10 local restaurants, was wrongly judged as a natural outbreak by public health experts (T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al., 1997). Public health authorities would never have known that this was bioterrorism, except for a confession by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh six months later, and the accidental discovery by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of their laboratory containing the exact outbreak strain a full 12 months later (T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al., 1997). Another example is Operation Seaspray, where bacteria were sprayed over San Francisco in open air testing by the U.S. military in 1950 (Wheat, Zuckerman, & Rantz, 1951). Treating doctors noted an unusual resultant illness in exposed people, but health professionals never identified the illness to be unnatural in origin, and the cause was not known until 20 years later, when it was disclosed (US Army, 1977). Unless the question of natural or unnatural origin is asked, unnatural outbreaks cannot be identified. Public health training, practice, and culture defaults to the assumption that every outbreak is natural in origin, and does not routinely include risk assessments for bioterrorism (MacIntyre, 2015a). Even if the questions were asked, except for smallpox which was eradicated in 1980 (WHO, 2019b), all known and new emerging infections cannot easily be discerned as natural or unnatural.
