            "text": "Early in the H1N1 pandemic, we realized that the rapid screening test (QuickVue A/B) used in our emergency department was only useful in patients who tested positive for influenza A. However, in adult ILI patients with false-negative rapid-screening influenza A tests (RIDTs), there was great diagnostic difficulty in categorizing patients from a clinical and epidemiologic perspective, i.e., adults admitted with suspected H1N1 pneumonia were placed on influenza precautions and given oseltamivir.2, 3 Early in the pandemic, single/negative-pressure rooms were quickly filled, and it became increasingly critical to devise a clinical diagnostic approach that would differentiate ILIs from the probable H1N1. When it was appreciated that RIDTs were frequently false negative, we used respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral test panels to try to increase diagnostic accuracy. Respiratory FA viral tests had the additional value of detecting not only influenza A and B but other respiratory viruses presenting as ILIs, e.g., metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and adenoviruses. Unfortunately, respiratory FA viral test results did not correlate well with results from RIDTs. In most cases, if a rapid influenza A test was positive, the respiratory FA viral panel was also positive for influenza A. However, when a rapid influenza A test was negative (which presented the most difficult diagnostic problem), the respiratory FA viral panel test was not frequently negative as well. When both the rapid influenza A screening test and the respiratory FA viral test were positive for influenza A, the results were highly predictive of a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for H1N1.",
