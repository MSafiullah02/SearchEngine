Y. pestis is one of the most invasive and virulent bacterial pathogens and has caused devastating pandemics, including the Black Death of 14th century Europe. The last plague pandemic began in Asia in the last half of the 19th century and lingered well into the 20th century, causing tens of millions of deaths as it spread across the world.",

            "text": "Three main forms of plague occur in humans. Bubonic plague, the most common, usually follows transmission by flea bite. Bacteria deposited in the dermal bite site travel through the lymphatic system to the regional draining lymph node. There, bacterial multiplication leads to the swollen, painful lymph node known as a bubo. At this stage, the disease can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics. The infection quickly spreads systemically via the blood stream to produce septicemic plague. If the flea deposits bacteria directly into the dermal vasculature, then primary septicemic plague can sometimes occur in the absence of bubonic plague [1] . In about 5% of humans, hematogenous spread to the lungs results in pneumonic plague. Because it can be spread directly from person-toperson via aerosolized respiratory droplets, this form of the disease presents a public health emergency. The case fatality rate of septicemic and pneumonic plague is high, even with antibiotic treatment.",

An adaptable pathogen, Y. pestis quickly established itself in many different species of rodents, among which it circulates using many different flea species as vectors. Thus, plague is more widespread today than it has ever been. It is certain that Y. pestis is permanently entrenched in wild rodent reservoir hosts in many parts of the globe, but the geographic extent of the enzootic foci is often poorly defined and subject to rapid expansion and contraction depending on factors such as climate and rodent and flea population dynamics [4] . After the last pandemic waned in the middle of the 20th century, the incidence of human plague declined dramatically. On average, a few thousand cases are reported to the WHO each year, although the actual disease incidence is almost certainly much higher. Beginning in the 1990s, however, outbreaks have occurred in parts of Africa, India, and South America where plague had previously been dormant for many years ( Fig. 9.1 ).",

Despite their recent common ancestry and genetic relatedness, the two sister-species differ radically in parasitic lifestyle. Y. pseudotuberculosis is a relatively benign food-and water-borne enteric pathogen. Evolutionarily speaking, therefore, plague is a new disease. The hypervirulence and arthropod-borne transmission of Y. pestis evolved quite recently and involved relatively few genetic changes, making plague an interesting historical case study in the sudden emergence of an epidemic infectious disease. It is sobering to reflect on the fact that only a modest number of minor genetic changes were needed to convert the relatively mild recent ancestor of Y. pestis into one of the most feared human pathogens.",

Remarkably, only 32 chromosomal genes occur in Y. pestis that do not have identical or highly similar orthologs in Y. pseudotuberculosis, as determined from comparative analyses of a panel of isolates of the two species from around the world. The most obvious genetic difference between the two species is the presence of two Y. pestis-unique plasmids that were acquired since the divergence from the ancestral Y. pseudotuberculosis strain. Using the flea infection and transmission model systems we developed to investigate the interactions between Y. pestis and the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis, the principal vector of human bubonic plague, we reported that both plasmids are essential for flea-borne transmission and virulence of plague. One plasmid encodes a phospholipase D (PLD) that had been originally characterized as murine toxin and presumed to have a role in virulence. We determined that this gene is not required for virulence and identified its true biological function: it is required for Y. pestis survival in the flea gut [7] .",

To produce a transmissible infection, Y. pestis grows in the flea digestive tract in the form of a bacterial biofilm, a dense multicellular community surrounded by a polysaccharide extracellular matrix (ECM), and usually attached to a surface [8] . In X. cheopis fleas, the Y. pestis biofilm often adheres to the hydrophobic, cuticlecoated spines that line the interior surface of the proventriculus, the valve that connects the esophagus to the midgut ( Fig. 9 .2). Consolidation and continued growth of the biofilm can eventually fill the proventriculus, interfering with its valvular action and blocking the normal flow of blood into the midgut when the flea attempts to feed. Complete or partial blockage of the proventriculus is prerequisite to efficient biological transmission, because it results in regurgitation of bacteria into the flea bite site [9, 10] .",

The hms genes are not required for virulence in the mammal; their biological function is specific to producing a transmissible infection in the flea. Intriguingly, Y. pseudotuberculosis never forms a biofilm in infected fleas, despite the fact that it contains identical orthologs to the Y. pestis hms genes and is able to form hms-dependent biofilms in vitro [13] . This suggests that regulatory pathways leading to ECM synthesis differ in the two species, and we have shown that loss of gene function in Y. pestis (pseudogene formation) has been important in this regard. About 7% of the ~4,000 orthologous gene pairs of the two species are pseudogenes in Y. pestis but are intact in Y. pseudotuberculosis. One of them, nghA, encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that specifically hydrolyzes b-1,6-Nacetyl-D-glucosamine and interferes with biofilm formation in the flea [12] . Another, rcsA, a negative regulator of the biofilm phenotype, is a functional gene in Y. pseudotuberculosis but a pseudogene in Y. pestis. Restoring the functional Y. pseudotuberculosis rcsA allele in Y. pestis essentially eliminated the ability to produce a proventricular-blocking biofilm in fleas [14] .",

We have recently implicated a second phosphodiesterase gene (rtn), whose product is truncated and nonfunctional in Y. pestis, in biofilm ECM regulation. As was the case for the rcsA pseudogene, replacement of the Y. pestis rtn pseudogene with the functional Y. pseudotuberculosis allele resulted in a greatly reduced ability to form biofilm in fleas. Because of their transmission-enhancing effects, mutational loss of the ancestral rcsA and rtn functions would likely have been positively selected during the emergence of Y. pestis.

In addition, the low number of bacteria transmitted by fleas mandates that Y. pestis must be invasive enough to produce this overwhelming sepsis starting from a small infectious dose that is deposited intradermally by flea bite; the LD 50 of Y. pestis for mammals is in fact less than 10 bacteria. Thus, the evolutionary change to the flea-borne transmission cycle likely imposed new selective pressures that favored the coevolution of increased virulence. Further epidemiological modeling based on the data indicated that a high flea density per host is required to sustain epizootic plague, supporting the practice of flea control alone as an effective strategy to control plague outbreaks.",

            "text": "A number of important virulence factors of Y. pestis have been discovered and an important basic pathogenesis strategy recognized -the ability to retard and attenuate the mammalian innate immune response [20, 21] . Thus, Y. pestis combines the dangerous attributes of stealth (the ability to prevent immune detection and stimulation) and aggression (rapid invasiveness) to produce rapidly fatal systemic sepsis. The molecular mechanisms by which it does so are incompletely known, however, and often based on in vitro evidence and inferences from studies of the enteropathogenic Yersinia species or attenuated Y. pestis strains. Thus, the molecular mechanisms underlying specific impairments of host defense remain to be determined or validated in vivo. To this end, we have developed, characterized, and used mouse and rat models of bubonic plague [22, 23] . The rat model had not been employed for many years, but disease progression and gross pathology in the rat more closely resembles human bubonic plague. In addition, the microbial pathogenesis of Y. pestis is seldom studied in the context of the natural flea-borne route of transmission. Nearly all studies have employed needleinjection of cultured bacteria. While this artificial transmission model is valuable, it ignores specific aspects of the natural transmission route, such as the unique biofilm phenotype assumed by Y. pestis in the flea and the effect of flea saliva. In fact, the true role and significance of some Y. pestis virulence factors were only revealed in studies employing transmission by flea bite [1, 24] . One way to discover new transmission and virulence factors is to analyze gene expression response patterns of the host-parasite interaction. Such microarray-based functional genomics strategies reveal genes that are specifically upregulated during infection, implicating them as being involved in the disease process. Furthermore, where and when a gene is expressed provides important clues about what the gene does [25] . In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of NIAID's Research Technologies Branch, we have characterized the in vivo transcriptome, or gene expression profile, of Y. pestis in infected fleas and in infected lymph nodes (buboes) of rats, as well as the transcriptome of rat lymph node cells during bubonic plague. A comparison of normalized gene expression levels from the two data sets provides insight into the biology of the flea-mammal life cycle and supports the hypothesis that Y. pestis differentially expresses distinct subsets of genes to establish a productive infection in its two disparate hosts. About 24% of Y. pestis genes showed significantly higher relative expression levels in the bubo than in the flea; 15% were higher in the flea than in the bubo; and 61% were not differentially expressed in the two hosts.",

Expression of 10 of the 14 proven or potential iron or heme transport systems, including three siderophore-based systems, five ABC iron transporters, a heme transport system, and an iron permease, was upregulated >5-fold in the bubo. Several genes that have been implicated in the bacterial protective response to RNS were also upregulated in vivo compared to in vitro. In particular, expression of hmp, which encodes a flavoglobin that is induced by NO and confers resistance to RNS, increased 10 to 20-fold in the bubo. NO-derived antimicrobial activity is generated by macrophages, neutrophils, and other host cells by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in response to bacterial infection [27] . In subsequent pathogenesis studies, we showed that large numbers of iNOS-expressing neutrophils are recruited to the infected bubo and are in close association with extracellular masses of Y. pestis, serum NO levels are elevated in rats with bubonic plague, and that mutation of the Y. pestis hmp gene resulted in decreased virulence. Current models of plague pathogenesis stress the ability of Y. pestis to inhibit phagocytosis and the inflammatory response, thereby avoiding exposure to innate immune effector molecules. Our results show that Y. pestis encounters and responds to NO-derived reactive nitrogen stress in the bubo, where it is extracellular. Although the importance of NO-derived stress in innate defense against intracellular pathogens is well-established, evidence for a role against extracellular bacteria such as Y. pestis is lacking. In addition to its antibacterial role in innate immunity, NO has known concentration-dependent immunosuppressive and other regulatory effects on the developing adaptive immune response; and high NO levels contribute to septic shock, the ultimate cause of plague mortality [27] . Thus, the elevated systemic NO levels we detected during plague disclose a new potential factor in disease pathogenesis and immunomodulation.",

Therefore, in a complementary project we compared the Y. pestis in vivo transcriptome in infective fleas to in vitro transcriptomes in temperature-matched biofilm and planktonic cultures, and to the previously characterized in vivo gene expression profile in the rat bubo. The results characterized a specific phenotype Y. pestis in the flea vector and implicated previously unrecognized genes involved in biofilm formation.

The use of PCR, real-time PCR, and other molecular biology tools for diagnosing plague from clinical specimens is also being assessed for use in reference laboratories.

This formulation reportedly provided short-term protection against bubonic plague only, and is no longer available. Two new subunit vaccines, both based on the surfaceexposed F1 and V antigens of Y. pestis, were developed at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the United Kingdom's defense department. Mouse and non-human primate trials have been completed for the USAMRIID vaccine, and both are now in human trials. Protection against bubonic plague was good in all animal models but mixed results were obtained for efficacy against pneumonic plague-good protection against aerosol challenge occurred in cynomolgus macaques, but not in African green monkeys [30] . The mechanisms of vaccine protection and predictive correlates of protection are not well understood. For example, humoral immunity is important, but antibody titers were not predictive of protection against aerosol challenge in non-human primates. Another potential shortcoming of these vaccines is the fact that the F1 capsular protein is not required for Y. pestis virulence; therefore, vaccinees might be unprotected against naturally occurring or deliberately engineered F1-negative strains. In addition, antigenic variants of the Y. pestis V antigen occur, and V antigen has been shown to have immunosuppressive effects, an undesired property of a vaccine component (30) . Thus, there is a need for further research on new vaccine candidates, but only limited information is available about the mammalian protective immune response to plague and the corresponding Y. pestis targets.

Far from being an historical curiosity, plague in the 21st century remains a public health threat that is incompletely understood. Plague still periodically reemerges, often after decades of quiescence, for enigmatic reasons. The occurrence of antibiotic resistant Y. pestis isolates and the documented potential of Y. pestis as an agent of bioterrorism increase the urgency for new medical countermeasures. Paramount among them is an effective plague vaccine, a goal that should be achievable. Successful development of these new tools, however, depends on further research to clearly define the molecular mechanisms of Y. pestis transmission, infection, and immunity.",
