Furthermore, the high variability in both underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms (endotypes) and clinical presentations (phenotypes) of CR has hindered efforts to develop clear guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment. Even the term rhinitis has been criticized because it connotes inflammation, whereas certain rhinitis endotypes seem to be devoid of an inflammatory component.5\n",

For instance, from a clinical perspective, patients are classified as blockers, with nasal congestion as the prominent symptom, and runners, with rhinorrhea being predominant. Also, rhinitis caused by mechanical/structural abnormalities is included in the NAR subgroup by some investigators7, 8 and excluded by others.9 Furthermore, occupational rhinitis can be either allergic or nonallergic, blurring the boundaries between the 3 widely accepted categories.10 Characterization of rhinitis phenotypes is further hampered by the scarcity of distinct biomarkers. Even for allergic rhinitis, for which the immunopathogenesis is more clearly delineated, clinical classification as proposed by Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines are frequently not adhered to by treating physicians who still do not prescribe or modify treatment based on phenotypic characteristics (eg, frequency or disease severity), contrary to the ARIA guidelines.11, 12, 13, 14 These studies underscore the difficulty of using only the phenotype concept to classify CR and highlight the importance of developing a classification system that focuses on rhinitis endotypes.15\n",

Chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps seems to mechanistically involve Th1 mucosal inflammation resulting in tissue remodeling caused by overexpression of transforming growth factor beta.20, 21, 22 The role of infection in this endotype, if any, is not clear.21, 23 In contrast, the endotype for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps seems to be Th2 skewed and characterized by increased levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 manifested as significant mucosal eosinophilia.24 A different endotype for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps characterized by preponderance of neutrophils may be seen in patients with cystic fibrosis,25 or in Asian populations, in which TH17 cytokines and interferon gamma may be predominant.26\n",

For example, there exist good responders, weak responders, and nonresponders to any given therapeutic agent (eg, anti\u2013IL-5\u2013responsive and anti-IgE\u2013responsive endotypes).16 However, it should be emphasized that poor treatment response may simply reflect an incorrect phenotypic/endotypic diagnosis, further emphasizing the need for better understanding of the pathogenesis of CR and chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes.",

It is an inflammatory condition caused by an IgE-mediated response to a spectrum of environmental allergens, including pollens, dust mite, cockroach frass, animal dander, rodents, and molds.35 Therefore, the diagnosis is established by skin-prick testing or specific IgE serologic testing to show IgE-mediated sensitization that corresponds with the patient\u2019s medical history of symptoms induced by exposure to 1 or more specific sensitizing allergens (Fig. 1\n). Nasally inhaled sensitizing allergens are processed by antigen-presenting cells in the nasal mucosa and presented to CD4+ T lymphocytes.36 During this sensitization phase, T lymphocytes produce cytokines (eg, IL-3, Il-4, IL-5, IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), which lead to differentiation of B lymphocytes to plasma cells, which in turn produce antigen-specific IgE, which binds to high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon receptor I [FcERI]) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. On allergen reexposure, specific allergenic peptides are recognized by antigen-binding sites of specific IgE bound to these mast cells or basophils, resulting in cross-linking of IgE molecules and activation of signaling cascades that lead to granule exocytosis (also called degranulation) of preformed and newly formed bioactive mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor).35, 37 A late-phase reaction typically follows up to 4 to 12 hours later, as a result of the release of chemokines and other chemoattractants that cause Th2 cells, activated eosinophils, and mast cells to migrate into the nasal epithelium where they release additional cytokines, enzymes, and mediators that perpetuate allergic inflammation,38, 39 causing delayed or persistent AR symptoms.",

Clinically, AR has traditionally been characterized as seasonal, attributed to seasonal allergens (pollens); perennial, associated with year-round allergens (dust mites, mold spores, and animal dander)3, 9; or episodic, caused by sporadic exposures. However, this phenotyping approach is often inconsistent and overlapping.9 Therefore, ARIA guidelines11, 12 have categorized AR by duration, either as intermittent (<4 days per week or <4 weeks) or persistent (>4 days per week and >4 weeks) and by severity as mild, characterized by normal sleep, no impairment of daily activities/work/leisure/sport/school, and no troublesome symptoms; and moderate/severe, associated with any of the characteristics listed earlier. Further AR phenotyping may include pattern of sensitization (monosensitized vs polysensitized). It was recently suggested in a Practical Allergy (PRACTALL) document that more attention should be paid to the underlying mechanisms related to aeroallergen sensitization even if such sensitization does not seem to drive symptoms, because this patient profile could potentially define a novel phenotype and/or endotype.40\n",

These fibers are thought to be primarily activated by transient response potential (TRP) calcium ion channels whose ligands have been shown to be affected by temperature, mechanical or osmotic stimuli, or a spectrum of chemical irritants. For example, TPRV1, for which capsaicin has been shown to be a specific ligand, is activated by hot temperatures. An acute exposure to capsaicin can activate TRPV1, whereas continuous exposure to capsaicin can desensitize this receptor40 (for a discussion of the mechanisms for NAR, see Baroody FM: Non-Allergic Rhinitis: Mechanism of Action, in this issue).",

Rhinitis of pregnancy typically begins in the last 6 weeks of pregnancy (after 34 weeks of gestation) and resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks postpartum,70 whereas menstrual cycle\u2013related rhinitis consists of premenstrual symptoms on a cyclical basis. These phenotypes are probably based on similar pathophysiologic mechanisms primarily mediated through increased levels of estrogen, which cause nasal congestion through vascular engorgement.71 This assumption was based mainly on reports from women taking contraceptive pills containing high estrogen levels, which caused rhinitis as a side effect. Assuming that estrogen does cause nasal obstruction, increased congestion would be expected during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, when the levels of estrogen are highest, but this is not always the case.71 Therefore, other mechanisms have also been suggested, including increased circulating blood volume caused by a vasodilating effect of progesterone, increased production of human growth hormone (which is also the basis of a proposed acromegaly-related rhinitis subtype), as well as enhanced production of a placental growth hormone variant, of an insulinlike growth factor-I, or of prolactin. Other key players could include beta-estradiol, which has been shown to increase the expression of histamine H1 receptors on mucosal epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells72 and to induce eosinophil migration and/or degranulation.71, 73 Other suggested forms of hormonal rhinitis, such as those linked with thyroid disorders, are not currently supported by a high level of scientific evidence.2, 33\n",

Regulation of vascular and glandular processes in the nose includes complex interactions between sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic nerves.76 Ingestion of the food could act as a mechanical stimulus that activates nociceptive sensory nerves, resulting in overactivation of parasympathetic fibers, as shown by the blunting of this effect by intranasal atropine.74, 77 However, the role of a hyperactive, NANC, or peptidergic neural system is still not well elucidated and remains under debate.64 Gustatory rhinitis has various endotypes/subtypes, including idiopathic gustatory rhinitis and posttraumatic, postsurgical, and cranial nerve neuropathy\u2013associated endotypes.64, 78 Idiopathic gustatory rhinitis, the most common of these entities, is prevalent in the general population.64 However, up to 45% of patients consider it no more than an annoyance, probably leading to an underestimation of its prevalence.75\n",

Physical examination in patients with rhinitis medicamentosa often reveals swollen, red nasal mucous membranes with minimal discharge. Two different endotypes can be discerned depending on the classes of nasal decongestants used that can cause this condition: sympathomimetics and imidazolines (Box 1\n). Sympathomimetic amines activate sympathetic nerves and cause vasoconstriction. Imidazolines cause vasoconstriction primarily through alpha2-adrenoreceptors. Cocaine (which is a potent vasoconstrictor) can also cause rhinitis medicamentosa, although usually symptoms are significantly more severe.82 Histologic changes consistent with rhinitis medicamentosa include ciliary loss, squamous cell metaplasia, epithelial edema, goblet cell hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell accumulation.83 When used briefly (<3\u20135 days consecutively), these medications provide significant relief of nasal congestion; however, prolonged use may lead to rhinitis medicamentosa. The mechanisms underlying this condition are variable and could be secondary to decreased production of endogenous norepinephrine through negative feedback84; the result of sympathomimetic amines with activity at both alpha and beta sites but a beta effect that outlasts the alpha effect causing rebound swelling84; or edema formation by altering vasomotor tone and vascular permeability through increased parasympathetic activity. Alongside rebound congestion, tachyphylaxis85 and, rarely, nasal septal perforation86 may also occur, although recent findings suggest that long-term use of these medications may be much safer when coadministered with intranasal steroids.87, 88\nBox 1Classes of drugs that cause rhinitis medicamentosa\nSympathomimeticsPseudoephedrineAmphetamineBenzedrineMescalinePhenylephrineEphedrinePhenylpropanolamine\nImidazolinesXylometazolineNaphazolineClonidineOxymetazoline\n",

Work-related-rhinitis is essentially an umbrella phenotype including occupational rhinitis, caused by factors in the work environment, and work-exacerbated rhinitis, in which a preexisting or concurrent rhinitis is worsened by occupational factors. Occupational rhinitis has been defined as \u201can inflammatory disease of the nose, which is characterized by intermittent or persistent symptoms (i.e., nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching), and/or variable nasal airflow limitation and/or hypersecretion due to causes and conditions attributable to a particular work environment and not to stimuli encountered outside the workplace.\u201d101 Occupational rhinitis includes conditions with similar characteristics to allergic, nonallergic,51 and irritant-induced phenotypes and to the neurogenic endotype. The nature of the workplace airborne agent exposures further defines the classification of occupational rhinitis into subvariants50:\u2022Sensitizer-induced (allergic) occupational rhinitis is an IgE immunologically mediated condition that can be induced by high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight antigens. High-molecular-weight agents such as plant/animal proteins and some low-molecular-weight agents like platinum salts act as complete antigens to elicit a specific IgE-mediated response, whereas low-molecular-weight agents such as some diisocyanates (hexamethylene diisocyanate) and acid anhydrides (trimellitic acid) act as haptens to bind endogenous proteins to form new allergenic peptides capable of eliciting a specific IgE-mediated response.\u2022The non\u2013IgE-mediated immunologic-mediated endotype is primarily caused by low-molecular-weight agents, including reactive chemicals, transition metals, and wood dusts, and is less common.50, 102, 103\n\u2022Nonallergic occupational rhinitis, also termed reactive upper airways dysfunction syndrome, is caused by a single exposure to high chemical irritant concentrations or multiple exposures to lower chemical irritant concentrations over time, the latter form also being termed irritant-induced rhinitis.50, 104 Both of these subforms can lead to significant inflammatory and even structural damage, resulting in so-called corrosive rhinitis, which is the severe end-stage form of the irritant-induced endotype, and is most often caused by potent toxic irritants such as chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia.105\n\n",

Different investigators have different views of whether these phenotypes are part of the NAR category or a stand-alone category. The most common symptom of these phenotypes is a sense of congestion either because of true blockage of the air passages or because of perceived congestion caused by a disturbance of normal airflow resistance and the development of a turbulent flow pattern.51 Septal deviation, commonly accompanied by contralateral compensatory turbinate hypertrophy, may cause nasal obstruction. Severe septal deviations may occur and impair nasal breathing, often unilaterally.1 Adenoidal hypertrophy typically manifests with nasal congestion, mouth breathing, nasal speech, and sleep apneic episodes/snoring.33 It is the most common acquired anatomic cause of nasal obstruction in infants and children,51 and is often associated with chronic allergic inflammation,1 which causes lymphoid hypertrophy leading to prominence of the adenoidal tissue and could therefore be postulated to represent a mechanical abnormality endotype, given its association with this defined mechanism. Choanal atresia, a rare congenital disorder involving blockage of the nose\u2013lower airways passage can go unnoticed for years if unilateral,106 but when bilateral presents with conspicuous symptoms caused by difficulty in breathing.107 Nasal tumors are comparably uncommon,108 whereas nasal trauma/foreign objects are fairly common and may lead to nasal obstruction easily discernable by history or endoscopy.109 Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, which is drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from an abnormal subarachnoid space\u2013nasal cavity pathway, is mainly a complication of surgery or trauma110 but can also be caused by benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri.51 It is characterized by clear watery secretion occasionally accompanied by headaches and olfactory impairment.16, 111\n",
