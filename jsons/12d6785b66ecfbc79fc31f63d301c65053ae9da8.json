            "text": "The Los Angeles Zoo has maintained and managed six different species of forest duikers since 1975. Over the years we have achieved relative success with the majority of these species. The maintenance and breeding of duikers has proved to be difficult at best. The major problems that we have experienced concern diet, stress-related medical conditions, neonatal mortality, and postanesthetic pneumonia. As concentrate selectors, duikers have a diet relatively low in fiber, a well-developed ability to forage selectively, a rumen bypass that is functionally important, a rapid passage and high fermentation rate for starch, and frequently encountered toxins. From an examination of the captive diet of duikers it is evident that the domestic fruits fed to duikers in captivity are not well suited for them. Duikers are highly susceptible to the slightest amount of stress. The group size in which duikers are managed has proved to be critical in the successful management of these species. In our earlier years of duiker management we often kept five or more animals together in a single exhibit. This would at times result in stress-related jaw abscesses. Our group size has since been reduced to no more than three animals in any one exhibit. Since 1977, the Los Angeles Zoo has had 92 duiker births. The survival rate past 6 months of age has been 61%. Of the 36 neonatal deaths, 42% were stillborn or died within a few hours of birth. Hypothermia and maternal neglect have been linked to infant mortality. Duikers are also easily prone to capture myopathy and regurgitation during anesthesia or capture, which can often lead to aspiration pneumonia. If at all possible, the capture and restraint of a duiker should be avoided. However, there are times when the capture or restraint (chemically or manually) of a duiker is required.",

The addition of crates or dog igloos in the enclosure also provides an area in which the animals can feel more secure.

Presently all duiker calves are pulled for hand rearing in order to keep the animals in a relatively calm state, thus making management of these species much safer and less difficult. There is one exception in which we do not pull a calf for hand rearing, and that is when both the sire and dam are very tractable and calm. In this instance we have found that the calf will also become tractable and calm.",

Speed is essential in capturing these animals because they can quickly become overheated. This is particularly true of the black duikers. One keeper controls the animal's back legs and the other keeper holds the head and front legs. It is very important to avoid applying too much pressure and restraint to the duiker's legs, to prevent their being broken. Close attention is paid to the animal's breathing and swallowing reflex. At the slightest sign of regurgitation or irregular breathing the duiker is immediately turned loose. For medical procedures it is important that the veterinary staff be prepared to complete the procedure as quickly as possible. It is also important to remember not to apply pressure to the rumen area, and to move the animal as little as possible during any restraint to help prevent regurgitation.

Overall, great strides have been made in duiker management that have led to improved husbandry and maintenance, as well as to the availability of these sensitive animals. These improvements have led animal managers who once ignored these species due to their lack of availability and difficult management to consider them for their collection plans. ",
