An abrupt ending of lockdown can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore, carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age and social contact structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.",

By now, this pandemic has severely affected various countries across the globe forcing more than one-third of the world population into a condition of lockdown, i.e. suppression of peoples gatherings in any form that includes shutting down of schools, workplaces and public transports etc.. Although, lockdown is playing a very important role in controlling the number of infections and mitigating the epidemic, it is not an economically viable solution, and therefore can not be sustained for long. Designing of strategies about the implementable exit scenarios and developing a blueprint of the social life in post-lockdown phase, until vaccine or treatment becomes available, 2 is the utmost need of the hour [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Fear is thought to have complementary effects on social interactions. It is reported that both social interactions and anxiety levels are controlled by projections from basolateral amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex [5] . Inhibition of this projection via opto-genetics is found to decrease anxiety levels and increase social interactions in mice. Thus, information based fear conditioning can serve as an important method in conjunction with other methods that can increase social distancing and precautionary behaviour. Fear conditioning, a subtype of classical conditioning [6] , is defined as a relationship developed between aversive events and an environmental stimuli by an individual [7, 8] . For example, in case of COVID-19, an individual can be considered fear conditioned if he establishes relationship between illness and touching of surfaces in public place. Thus, he starts considering exposure to surfaces in public place as an exposure to virus itself. For fear conditioning to happen, an unconditional stimuli (exposure to virus in the current example) is to be paired with a conditional stimuli (touching surfaces in public space). Once this learning has taken place, conditional stimuli (surfaces in public place) will also elicit the same response in an individual even in the absence of unconditional stimuli. If the individual is subjected to conditional stimuli without unconditional stimuli for long time, the learned behavior starts diminishing. Therefore, a term \"fear-time\" is defined as the time it takes for behaviour due to fear conditioning gets extinct. Operant conditioning is defined as a kind of learning in which a behavior is enhanced or reduced by methods of punishment or reinforcement. Positive reinforcement happens when a person is rewarded for a certain behavior and thereby encourages him to repeat the same behavior. For example, in case of COVID-19, if an individual having a belief that touching surfaces in public places is wrong is rewarded can increase the fear-time.",

            "text": "In this work, we propose a model to examine the role of fear in managing the COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase, with media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with operant conditioning as one such prospective method. Fear, in the present work, is defined as learning of relationship between COVID-19 (aversive event) and the various ways through which it can spread (stimuli). This can be learned by various means like seeing a person who is suffering from COVID-19 but the fastest way for such conditional learning is through mass media. Media influence plays a significant role in spreading useful information through various sources, like, television, community radio, internet and print media (such as, newspapers, magazines) etc., resulting in changed behaviour of a community. Individuals who interact quite frequently have stronger connection to influence others, and pass on the similar information among them [9, 10] . Therefore, the model developed in this paper examines the media induced fear on epidemic progression by hypothesizing that inducing fear conditioning and increasing its fear time by operant conditioning via mass media (television, community radio, internet and print media) will have a negative effect on progression of COVID-19. As we are only considering positive reinforcement; three terms, operant conditioning, reward, and positive reinforcement have been used interchangeably throughout this paper.",

In the Results section, simulation outcomes of the developed SFEIR model incorporating fear conditioning via mass media in Indian population are presented and their implications are elaborated. We first compare the simulations of SFEIR model with the classical SEIR models (not having fear conditioning) with or without lockdown, and then study the effect of varying the impact of fear conditioning and reward parameters. We then study the effect of school closure and increased fear conditioning on people of age 10-59 years in the spread of COVID-19 during post lockdown phase. Finally, we conclude with the discussions and potential policy perspectives of the present work on the influence of media on collective psychology of a community to counter COVID-19 progression in the post-lockdown phase.",

A susceptible person can be exposed to infection either directly or after moving into the fear compartment [11] . Feared individuals are less social [5] and take more precautions, and therefore will have lower probability of transmission (\u03b2 F ) as compared to individuals in susceptible group (\u03b2). Feared individuals recover from fear with fear recovery rate \u03b3 F and move back into susceptible compartment. \u03b3 F is inversely proportional to fear time T . Once exposed, the rate of getting infected by pathogen is \u03b3 E and the rate of recovery is \u03b3 P . While formulating the SFEIR model, age-and social contact-structures are incorporated as detailed in [12, 13] . In the age-structured population, first group consists of individuals of age (0 \u2212 4) years, second group is of age (5 \u2212 9) years, and so on, till group 16 th that consists of individuals of age (75 \u2212 79) years. It is considered that susceptible individuals can develop fear through various media platforms, like, television, community radio, internet, print media etc. in the post-lockdown phase. Considering S i , F i , E i , I i and R i as the variables representing the number of individuals belonging to i th age group in Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered compartments, respectively, the generalized age-and social contact-structured SFEIR model is given as:",

The peak height ratio in this case also follows the sigmoidal pattern as shown in Closure of schools is one of the most often considered non-pharmaceutical intervention to control a pandemic [27] . In this section, we first analyse the effect of keeping schools closed after the lockdown is over i.e. on 61 st day (3 rd May in present scenario), in the absence of fear. This is done by keeping the values of contact matrix of school, C S ij = 0. As seen in Fig. 6a , this step, while shifting the peak of the curve, reduces the height of peak to approximately 3 5 th of the original curve. Hence, it may be concluded that by just keeping schools closed and opening all other places after the lockdown will not have substantial effect on the containment of epidemic.",

To highlight the importance of media in order to make community driven changes rather than forced interventions from government, in this work, we modelled the media induced fear conditioning supplemented by positive reinforcement in the Indian population. Reward parameter r, quantifying the effect of positive reinforcement via various media platforms, was used as an abstract parameter that can represent various methods of positive reinforcement, like, praise for having certain beliefs that may be accorded by the social, religious and political leaders. The simulation results show that if more people become fearful, the number of COVID-19 infections will decrease significantly. This manifests mainly because fearful people will socialize less [5] and will take more precautions in their daily life. Excessive fear conditioning can result in abnormal behaviours, like, specific phobias [33] and obsessive compulsive disorder [34] . Therefore, care must be taken while developing practical methods of implementing fear conditioning so as to minimize the risk of such abnormal behaviors.",

In India, people of all the generations interact with each other within home (as depicted in Fig 9) . So, if people in age group (10-59) are sufficiently fear conditioned, the probability of maintaining physical distance among these two groups will increase leading to effectively decreasing the number of infections in older generation even if older generation is not enough fear conditioned. In conjunction to this, keeping the schools closed in the post-lockdown phase can further reduce the number of infections among group G 3 . This can be explained by the fact that India has higher probability of contact between people in age group 0-29 and age group 60-79 as seen for the contact data at home shown in Fig.   18 9 below. interact with each other in India.

Number of cases increased to 3 by 3 rd February, all of them were recovered by 20 th February. There was no new case of infection till 2 nd March, after which number of cases started increasing rapidly. Therefore, 0 th day in SFEIR model is taken as 3 rd March, 2020.Time series for active cases was taken from[26]. Model was fitted to data using non-linear square fit method.

Parameters of our stratified model are chosen on the basis of current available data of COVID-19. To begin with, we first fitted the time series data of COVID-19 infections in India into a curve using non-linear least square fit Fig. 2. On fitting the active case data of India from 3 rd March 2020 to 22 nd April 2020, fit parameters are obtained as \u03b1 1 = 1.327, and \u03b1 2 = 0.026. The value of \u03b1 1 being returned slightly more than the ideal case value 1 is probably due to the presence of incubation period and contact at work not being exactly equal to zero (as COVID-19 warriors, e.g. health professional, police personals etc. are still at work). Non-linear least square fit on the currently available data of COVID-19 infections in India. A. Comparing the three variants of SFEIR model As discussed in the Methods section, whole population of India was divided into 16 classes of different age groups.

Comparative analysis of fear conditioning with schools closure for different time periods Here, we have analysed the time needed to keep schools closed along with the intensity of fear conditioning (characterized by \u03ba and r) required for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in post-lockdown phase in India. We chose two set of values of \u03ba and r from 4c and 4d one belonging to transition and and the other belonging to saturation phase of respective sigmoidal curves. Thus, four cases were designed: Case I: \u03ba (in transition phase) = 0.2 and r (in transition phase) = 10 7a Case II: \u03ba (in transition phase) = 0.2 and r (in saturation phase) = 40 7b Case III: \u03ba (in saturation phase) = 0.6 and r (in transition phase) = 10 7c Case IV: \u03ba (in saturation phase) = 0.6 and r (in saturation phase) = 40 7d For each case, different time periods of keeping schools closed were plotted starting from 61 days (i.e. 3 rd May, in present scenario) to 451 days with step size of 30 days. In case I, severity of pandemic is still substantial and effect of schools closure does not have much effect. In cases II and III, if schools are kept closed, exponential increase in number of infections is halted. This will constraint the growth of pandemic but as soon as schools are repopened, number of infections will spike upward. Therefore, schools need to be kept closed for indefinite period, which is not at all practical. However this combination can control the epidemic spread till the vaccines and medicines are available. Results are summarized in 7b and 7c . In case IV, as shown in 7d, the curve has a negative slope if schools are kept closed. The number of cases reduces to less than 1,000 if schools are opened after 451 days (by May end 2021) from 3 rd March, 2020.
