The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the sudden emergence of the new coronavirus classification A total of 44 notifiable infectious diseases were included in this study. We adapted and revised Zhang and Wilson's 2012 classification of 44 CISDCP notifiable infectious diseases into seven major categories reflecting disease causes, characteristics, and policy responses. 3 The main revisions were the inclusion of hepatitis A, B, and D as vaccine preventable diseases. Hepatitis C was classified within an extended category of sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections and hepatitis E similarly for zoonotic infections. The revised categories were quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne (see table  1 ). Medical staff confirmed all patients with a clinical diagnosis by clinical standards and laboratory tests based on national uniform standards (see supplementary appendix). Since 2014, H1N1 has been included in the seasonal influenza category. 19 Case information recorded in CISDCP included time and place of onset and death, diagnosed disease, age, sex, and occupation. Case identification information (eg, name, address) is not recorded to ensure confidentiality of data.",

We compared the ranks and proportions of each notifiable infectious disease for incidence, number of --H5N1  -------H1N1  -------SARS  ------ cases, and deaths in each year and changes over the study period. Age and province specific disease in each survey year and the seasonal variation of each disease by month were also analysed. To identify the features of major infectious diseases we extracted the top infectious disease for each age and province. We compared the characteristics of trends from 2008 to 2017 in the leading infectious diseases by age from 6 to 22 years. The \u03c7 2 test was used to compare the incidence by sex and interregional differences in disease categories. Joinpoint regression models 22 were used to examine trends in incidence for each infectious disease from 2008 to 2017 and to estimate annual percentage changes (APCs). The same models were used to test the differences across regions and sexage subgroups. Joinpoint regression analysis identifies time points in which trends significantly change (ie, joinpoints), using calendar year as the timescale. 23 24 To determine the location of the joinpoints, we used the grid search method. This creates a grid of all possible locations for joinpoints at each survey year and tests the sum of squared errors for each point to find the best fit. 22 25 Joinpoint regression assumes normal distribution of disease incidence. If this assumption does not hold, data transformation is recommended. In our data, some infectious diseases had Poisson distributions and required a logarithmic transformation to approxi mate a normal distribution. The resulting loglinear models were easier to interpret in the joinpoint regression analysis. Under a loglinear model, rates change at a constant percentage each year, calculated in our study as a fixed APC, whereas in a linear model, the rates change at a constant amount each year. When comparing trends in different categories or for specific infectious diseases or across provinces, the rates are different. The advantage of a loglinear model is that the APC can be compared across widely different scales. For example, rare and common infectious diseases might change at the same annual percentage each year, but it is unlikely that they would change at the same fixed amount each year. With this approach, infectious diseases were assumed to change at a constant percentage of the rate of the previous year. For example, if the APC was 1% and the rate was 50 per 100 000 in 2007, then in 2008 the rate was 50\u00d71.01=50.5, and in 2009 the rate was 50.5\u00d71.01=51.005. Rates that change at a constant percentage every year change linearly on a log scale. The P value for a two sided test that the true APC is zero was calculated based on a t distribution. If the APC was nonsignificant (P\u22650.05), we regarded trends as stable, otherwise, it increased or decreased for each infectious disease from 2008 to 2017.",

Quarantinable diseases are not presented because haemorrhagic fever dominated all the provinces without regional variations. lines indicate the leading infectious disease in each province vaccination programme and improved sanitation have contributed to the decrease in incidence of hepatitis A and B, contrasting with an increasing incidence in Chinese adults. 28 Both hepatitis A and B vaccines were included in the national immunisation programme (in 2008 and 2001, respectively) and a vaccine against hepatitis E virus is now licensed in China. 29 The implementation of mumps into the expanded programme for immunisation in mainland China in 2008 would have contributed to its decreasing incidence, 30 but in the past two years its incidence has increased so that it is now the most common infection in children and adolescents aged 1022 years. The reasons for this rebound remain unclear but raise questions around vaccine coverage, notwithstanding that other vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, and neonatal tetanus have shown continuing declines. The number of rabies cases has also declined, reflecting comprehensive preventive measures, including vacci nation of dogs and postexposure prophylaxis. 31 Tuberculosis and scarlet fever were the most common bacterial infections. Tuberculosis is the 11th leading cause of death worldwide and was the leading cause of death from infectious disease in Chinese children and adolescents in 2017. 32 Globally, the incidence of tuberculosis has declined, with a 19% fall between 2000 and 2016. 33 While the incidence of tuberculosis among Chinese children and adolescents aged 622 years decreased, with an annual average decline of 5.1% from 2008 to 2017, its overall ranking remained unchanged. Incidence was higher in children and adolescents aged between 12 and 22 years compared with younger children aged between 6 and 11 years, consistent with previously documented age trends. 34 China's scalingup of its national tuberculosis control programme to cover half the population during the 1990s and the entire population from 2000 seems likely to have contributed to this decline. 35 Multidrug resistant tuberculosis is emerging as a challenge in tuberculosis control in China. 36 In 2017, around 3.5% of new cases of tuberculosis in both children and adults were multidrug resistant, with an 18% prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis among those previously treated. 36 37 An increase in the incidence of scarlet fever has also been observed in other countries recently. 3840 The marked increase in Chinese children and adolescents since 2011 coincides with its resurgence in England 38 and South Korea. 39 This reemergence of scarlet fever has led to the adoption of symptom surveillance and early warning systems, followed if necessary by enforced absenteeism from school. Similar measures have also been recommended for childhood gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases (infectious diarrhoea; dysentery; hand, foot, and mouth disease; typhoid and paratyphoid; and acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis), 40 but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. Scarlet fever had the highest incidence of any infectious disease in the eastern and northern regions and in 6 to 11 year olds, but tuberculosis dominated the rest of China and in those aged 12 to 22 years. Such variation suggests a need for age and region specific control measures.",

            "text": "The incidence and number of cases of HIV/AIDS in Chinese adolescent males aged from 14 to 22 years have rapidly increased from 2008 to 2017, with HIV/AIDS now the leading notifiable infectious cause of death in Chinese children and adolescents, particularly males. The increasing incidence of HIV seems to be related to high risk sexual behaviours and poor awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention. 41 By the end of 2018, 149 000 people with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS had been reported, 95% of which were sexually transmitted. Of these, 16 000 new HIV/AIDS cases were reported among 1524 year olds. College and university students accounted for more than 3000 cases, with more than 80% in men who had sex with men. 42 China's latest national survey shows that by 2019 the transmission of HIV through blood transfusion effectively no longer occurred, and transmission through intravenous drug misuse and mothertochild transmission had been curbed. Globally, one sixth of AIDS related deaths and one seventh of new HIV infections are in children younger than 15 years, with 90% caused by mother tochild transmission. 43 A metaanalysis of 57 studies that covered all provinces in China showed that the rate of mothertochild transmission in China was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 3.2% to 5.5%), substantially higher than in the US and Europe (<1%), but lower than in some low and middle income countries in sub Saharan Africa (11%). 44 Sexual transmission, notably in men who have sex with men, has become the main transmission route, especially among college students. 42 45 There have been a range of other contributing factors, including a lack of access to appropriate sex education in secondary schools, a heteronormative approach to the content of sex education, a permissive attitude towards casual sex in university students, and ready access to sex, facilitated by social media. 41 In 2015, the Chinese government introduced initiatives targeting HIV in adolescents and young adults age from 15 to 49 years, 46 with the health and education ministries jointly establishing an epidemic notification system tied with stronger school based HIV prevention and control measures 47 ; strategies that coincide with a decrease in incidence. However, the global campaign for comprehensive sex education launched by UNESCO in 2018 should be promoted further in China to provide children and adolescents with an evidence based understanding of their sexual and reproductive health, and with the skills to talk with their peers, families, and communities about safe and consensual sexual relationships. 48 There is also a pressing need for other school and university based interventions, including network peer education, psychological counselling and education, and access to rapid testing for sexually transmitted infections. 49 In addition to the lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections in young children, the major causes of such diseases are likely to differ.",

            "text": "Overall, China has made great advances in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in children and adolescents. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a substantial investment was made in capacity building for laboratory testing, surveillance system enhancement, national intervention programmes for specific diseases, and collaboration with international partners. 1 15 The major Special National Science And Technology Project On Preventing And Controlling Infectious Diseases that began in 2008 has received a total investment of about $2.25bn (\u00a31.77bn; \u20ac2.00bn). 50 This project has led to expanded and enhanced screening for infectious diseases, reductions in treatment costs, and increased access to treatment. Furthermore, the national immunisation programme for children in China was expanded in 2008, which is thought to have contributed to the marked reduction in the overall number of cases of vaccine preventable diseases found in the current study. 51 52 Beyond immunisation programmes, multisectoral collaboration also underpins efforts to control infec tious diseases. In China, some parasitic diseases (eg, schistosomiasis) have reached or are approaching elimination status; the result of collaboration bet ween the departments of health, agriculture, and the environment. 53 Our findings are consistent with filariasis being eliminated during the study period, as certified by the World Health Organization in 2007. 15 Schistosomiasis in adolescents in China is also close to elimination, and malaria has steadily declined from 3221 cases in 2008 to only 25 cases in 2017, consistent with the goal of nationwide elimination by 2020. 54 China still, however, faces challenges in responding to infectious diseases in children and adolescents. Firstly, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and changing patterns of interactions between people and pathogens have altered the pattern of infectious diseases, 15 a feature of the covid2019 outbreak. Geographical disparities raise questions around access to healthcare, other medical and educational resources, public health programmes, and infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Not surprisingly, the western regions of China with poor resources and a special geographical environment and culture face a burden from multiple infectious diseases, with Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang having higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. However, the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are also affected by densely populated urban regions, 55 which might contribute to higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases and viral gastrointestinal infec tions, at least in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Different factors apply in rural and remote areas, where livestock based lifestyles increase the risk of zoonotic infections and where climate might be an additional factor, particularly for vectorborne diseases. Seasonal variation in infectious diseases, with the example of peaks of influenza and rubella, measles, and scarlet fever in winter and spring suggests the high vulnerability of Chinese children to infections transmitted by aerosol droplets. Furthermore, the rapid increase in HIV/AIDS, especially in adolescent males, requires a much wider set of social and educational responses than for less sensitive behaviours and stigmatised diseases. The resurgence of some diseases that were previously under control (eg, scarlet fever, mumps, syphilis, and brucellosis) and imported cases (eg, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and Ebola) have put greater pressure on the public health system, as has been seen with the current covid2019 outbreak that began in Hubei province, China. Although in most cases of covid19, mortality appears to be higher in older people, 10 although the immediate impact of this on children and adoles cents is nonetheless immense. A global pandemic of covid19 could bring about multiple impacts, such as economic recession, food crisis, price fluctuations, constraints on resources, which will have immediate or indirect negative effects on children in the near or long term. In addition, the exact impact has not yet been determined in further studies, but there could be physical and psychological effects on children who have been deprived of concentrated effort of care as a result of the guardian's illness, which need further studies postcovid19.",

Under regulations from the China Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP), health facilities are required to report all cases of notifiable infectious diseases through the web based system, with the validity of the surveillance system being continuously monitored. In terms of system coverage, although CISDCP has not yet reached all health facilities in China, all types of health facilities are covered, including hospitals, CDCs, community health centres, township health centres, and village clinics. Total coverage is at least 85% throughout the country with more than 95% coverage of county level and above facilities each year (see supplementary fig S1) . Among 69 881 facilities with reported case information in 2014, the participation levels were 3597 CDCs (100%), 13 764 hospitals (97%), and 37 494 township level clinics (89%). 56 Despite this, the national coverage of CISDCP remains biased to some extent. The coverage within some provinces, particularly in the less developed provinces in western China, such as Tibet (18.6%), Qinghai (66.8%), and inner Mongolia (58.5%), was lower than in eastern more developed regions (95.1%). Furthermore, cove rage of township level health facilities in rural areas remained less than that in urban cities with facilities above county level. It is therefore likely that we have underestimated infectious diseases in western less developed regions, and in remote towns and rural areas of China (see supplementary fig S2) .",

            "text": "A second consideration is the validity of the surveillance system and accuracy of diagnosis. Gene rally, although suspected cases, pathogen carriers, and confirmed cases are all entered into CISDCP, in the present study we only analysed patients with a diagnosis confirmed by both uniform clinical standards and laboratory tests (ie, examination of, for example, pathogen, serology, imaging; see supplementary table S5 and the appendix). Decisions about diagnosis are overseen by professional trained specialists from the CISDCP, which ensures a high level of accuracy within this sample. For example, the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS is based on laboratory serum testing for HIV antibody and the detection of pathogens, combined with clinical symptoms and epidemiological data. However, under reporting will be variable, most likely for people with subclinical and asymptomatic infections being managed at home, especially for seasonal influenza; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and infectious diarrhoea, particularly in remote areas. In contrast, serious infections that are highly contagious and might result in outbreaks or epidemics (categories A and B in China's domestic notifiable infectious diseases classification; see supplementary table S4) will have high sensitivity and specificity. This includes the plague, cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, dysentery, and measles. It is possible that variable clinical expertise and technical expertise influences the number of confirmed cases in any setting. However, all 44 notifiable diseases in CISDCP have well established case definitions and diagnostic pathways, incorporating clinical features identification, labo ratory confirmation, reporting procedures, and deter mination of specific pathogens. Nearly all of the 44 notifiable diseases had consistent case definitions and diagnostic criteria across the decade. Considering the consistent geographical variations in CISDCP coverage and the definitions and diagnostic criteria, and the stability of pathogenicity of most pathogenic agents, the likelihood of variation over time for subclinical and asymptomatic cases in the 44 notifiable diseases over the past decade is unlikely to have affected the trend analyses reported here. We note that estimates of the burden of death might vary between countries for mortality from seasonal influenza. For example, in China the use of estimates from death certificates that specifically list influenza will underestimate the burden of influenza, whereas the mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza deaths such as used in the United States could result in overestimation. 57 Clearly, new challenges for the surveillance system are posed by emerging infectious diseases with an unclear disease course, such as covid2019.",

            "text": "One further limitation of our study is that the study population were Chinese students. As we excluded children and adolescents who were not studying, we are unable to comment on the epidemiology of infectious diseases in preschool children. 58 Given the free nine year compulsory education system in China, it is likely that the data for the younger student population will be broadly representative of this age group. The estimate bias in our study is likely to be higher with age (see supplementary fig S11) , which might lead to underestimation of the actual burden of infectious diseases in adolescents, particularly for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. Because of the social stigma around some sexually transmitted diseases, and lack of health service use for milder gastrointestinal infections, we could have underestimated the burden from these diseases. 59 Although more males than females in each age group were not included in the analysis, the percentage of girls not included was larger (17.0% v 19.8%). As a result, although we underestimated the number of boys with notifiable infectious diseases nationally, the rates of underestimation were probably higher among girls who completed school early after conclusion and policy implications From 2008 to 2017, China achieved impressive reductions in the burden from infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6 to 22 years. This complements the reduction in mortality from infectious diseases in under 5s-a longstanding focus of the Millennium Development Goals, and will contribute to reductions in the overall burden from infectious diseases in China. 16 60 However, China's rapid success poses challenges for policy makers as priorities for infectious disease control continue to evolve. Beyond maintaining the gains, the priorities for the coming decade include reducing regional inequalities; scalingup vaccination for mumps, sea sonal influenza, and hepatitis B; preventing further escalation of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; and redoubling efforts around persisting diseases, including tuberculosis, rabies, and scarlet fever. Different responses will be needed by region and by age across childhood and adolescence, while the newer emerging disease epidemics will require rapid and targeted responses. Seasonal variation in respiratory infections and in gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases reflect the high vulnerability of children and adolescents. A comprehensive national surveillance system remains an integral part of infectious disease control in these age groups to maintain the gains of recent decades and respond effectively to new epidemics. We thank the team members and health staff involved in China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention for their support.",
