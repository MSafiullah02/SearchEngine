Healthy citizens contribute to nation's development in large extent. Every government has dedicated big amount of budgets for Information Technology (IT) based healthcare support services. IT can provide efficient methods to store and convey information related to the health of every citizen. So, sincere efforts are required to provide ubiquitous healthcare support services using IT infrastructure. Major challenge in any nationwide healthcare support services is the requirement of huge amounts of storage and fast computational power along with its day-to-day maintenance issues. However, with the involvement of distributed technologies such as cloud computing, it is very easy to deploy and use IT systems with varying computational demands. Cloud computing is a highly cost effective IT paradigm which provides on-demand IT resources on a pay-as-use pricing model. Successful adoption of cloud computing by the reputed organizations has inspired researchers to provide healthcare support services over the cloud computing infrastructure [2]. Leveraging cloud computing for healthcare support services facilitates many additional benefits such as ease in swapping records between hospitals and local clinics as well as in effective management of centralized medical records. It not only relives user from storage and processing infrastructure capital investment, but also prevents maintenance and licensing issues [3]. Accessibility, scalability, availability, storage capability, cost effectiveness and agility are some of the major benefits that can encourage any nation's healthcare departments or private hospitals to shift towards e-health clouds.",

            "text": "The most crucial part of any healthcare support service is the continuous monitoring of an outbreak for any deadly disease. H1N1 is an infectious virus which on spreading affects a large volume of the population. This infectious disease had affected global population in the past due to which approximately 5% of the total world's population had died and hence it had proved to be the deadliest outbreak ever. Alone in the 20th century, the H1N1 virus outbreak has occurred thrice which had affected 500 million people all over the world [1]. WHO states non-existence of primary H1N1 immunity in humans is the root cause of its epidemic. People need to get educated about precautions and handling of this deadly disease. There is a need of using both pharmaceutical as well as non-pharmaceutical strategies to decrease its harmful effects. Cloud computing technologies can be efficiently employed to prevent and keep track of this virus strain. Cloud computing provides virtually unlimited storage, web services and processing capabilities so, huge amount of virus related data can be linked through social networking and other health aided cloud web services. Moreover, using cloud computing for healthcare support services enables an individual to manage their own health status more effectively. Vital statics of whole country regarding the epidemic at different level of abstraction can be accessed with high accuracy. Thus, cloud computing can effectively improvised the detection of H1N1 virus at its initial stages. The objectives of the study conducted in this paper is to provide feedback about the individual health condition, design effective information sharing mechanism and real-time representation of the current status of the epidemic. The designed system keeps track of the current status of this pandemic and stores all the records for later use as well. The main contribution of this work is the categorization of patients into different categories, continuous monitoring of infected patients and identifying the probability of each user in spreading or receiving the infection by analyzing his/her relationship with infected patients.",

It initially screens H1N1 virus infected patients using random decision tree into five categories based on their respective symptoms. Based on these categories, various control measures are suggested and patients are monitored regularly using a personalized monitoring routine. For every user, Outbreak Role Index (ORI) is calculated which represents his/her future probability in spreading or receiving the infection. Apart from ORI, several other outbreak metrics such as centrality, cluster coefficient, edge embeddeness are also computed using Social Network Analysis. Continuous alerts in case of health threatening conditions are generated and are sent to respective patients. Information and suggestions based upon the respective H1N1 category of user are also provided. The querying capability of this system allows users to intuitively retrieve personalized information. The aim of this paper is to provide a blueprint of the plan to be exercised during this deadly pandemic.",

[4] firstly identified H1N1 influenza virus with about 642 confirmed cases on 15th April 2009. They provided its initial symptoms and effects on the human body. Garten et al. [5] studied antigenic and genetic characteristics of H1N1 virus. Jain et al. [6] examined the clinical characteristics of patients admitted in April to June 2009 affected with H1N1. Neumann et al. [7] reviewed the H1N1 emergence in 2009 and its potential to spread again if not properly controlled. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [8] also submitted their recommendations on vaccination for H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. As the vaccination of H1N1 is highly recommended for pregnant ladies to prevent infants from infection, McMillan et al. [9] reviewed its need and safety concerns for both mother and infant. Takeda et al. [10] in 2015 studied the effect of latest H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy on both mother and infant. In 2014, WHO [1] piled up health related data for all of its 194 member countries. Progress made in health related targets and associated goals were included. Annual life expectancy and mortality rates due to improper health were estimated by WHO. Data collected by WHO indicated that there is high neonatal mortality rates in low income countries due to improper health guidance. In 2009, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) [11] also published guidelines on categorization of Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Based on various physiological signals, patients were screened and categorized into various categories of infection. According to these categories, relevant information and suggestions were also provided.",

[16] developed a H1N1 pandemic forecasting system based on daily influenza cases and total population in Hong Kong. They used spatial\u2013temporal and stochastic SEIR methods to predict number of cases for next two days. In 2015, Cruz et al. [17] studied the importance of effective communication system in case of any large scale pandemic. In 2014, Wang et al. [18] examined the spread of H1N1 in 2009 for the schools of China. They found that most of the infection transmission is within the same grade and cross grade infection transmissions are very few. In 2014, Dias and Arruda [19] proposed a mathematical based cost optimization model for controlling H1N1 pandemic based on mean of finite difference method. In 2014, Cui et al. [20] demonstrated the public attention model for epidemics like H1N1 using spatial\u2013temporal patterns. In 2014, Bdeir et al. [21] discovered some of hidden social networks between different organizations during H1N1 epidemics. They also suggested that relevant and timely exchange of information between different organizations can result in better prevention of epidemics. In 2014, Farah et al. [22] developed a dynamic epidemic model for H1N1 using a Bayesian based emulator. Emulator took basic epidemic details and time series of all reported infections to design the model. In 2013, Zhong et al. [23] compared standard as well as modified compartment model of epidemic controlling using H1N1 2009 epidemic data of Arizona state. In 2013, Duan et al. [24] applied a triple approach known as artificial societies, computational experiments and parallel execution to study and control epidemics. They used the data of H1N1 2009 outbreak in China University and examined the social network, student behavior, population distribution and contact patterns of the virus. In 2012, Yi [25] proposed an ontology driven approach in searching medical databases for case studies in H1N1 outbreaks. In 2011, Bajardi et al. [26] studied the impact of travel restriction during H1N1 2009 epidemic. They found that only restricting international travelers will not result in effective control of epidemic. However, inducing local mobility aware factors can result in reduction of infection spread. In 2009, Balcan et al. [27] modeled the critical demand and supply chain for H1N1 infections antibiotic resources. In 2009, Araz et al. [28] presented a geospatial\u2013temporal disease model to reduce peak infection rates at any instant of a pandemic outbreak. They investigated that if school children are properly scanned and protected, pandemic influenza infections can be minimized with minimum loss of education. In 2009, Coker [29] reviewed swine flu as a communicable disease which spreads by travelling, public gatherings and direct contacts. Virus detection methods such as real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral culture, rapid antigen tests, immunofluorescent antibody testing were discussed. Case definition, preventions, recommendations, and efforts at global level were also provided. In 2009, Colizza et al. [30] estimated the H1N1 cases in Mexico City based on a spatially structured epidemic model. In 2009, Sloot et al. [31] developed a decision support system for coordinating any viral infection spread. It provides different type of functionalities such as personalized drug ranking, spatial, temporal, and social interactions.",

In 2011, Van den Broeck [36] studied an effective epidemic modeling and computational tool known as GLEaMViz. It provides different simulating environments as well as visualization tools to effectively represent any epidemic causes and effects. In 2012, Li et al. [37] used data driven inference algorithms to simulate the H1N1 infection outbreak. In 2012, Cheng et al. [38] demonstrated H1N1 outbreak simulations using agent based artificial transport method. In 2012, Tizzoni et al. [39] argued that mathematical based outbreak simulation's reliability is under debate. They tested reliability of Monto Carlo maximum likelihood analysis based mathematical approach using 2009 H1N1 epidemic. Results indicated that simulations were successful in predicting the outbreak spread when compared with real life data. In 2012, Zarrabi et al. [40] proposed a filter-reduction method to study the HIV infection using social interactions and genetic information. In 2014, Duan et al. [41] studied the spreading velocity of any epidemic based on topology of weighted graph created. In 2014, Mei et al.

Cloud computing concatenated with healthcare and its support services reduces management as well as maintenance costs. Certain issues such as continuous availability of e-health data and infrastructure to be used for e-health clouds such as public, private or hybrid were also highlighted. In 2014, Sood and Sandhu [49] proposed a proactive resource provisioning methodology using two-dimensional resource provisioning matrix. Resources required in the future were predicted using these matrices by the effective use of artificial neural network. Bill calculated by the cloud providers was cross-checked by independent authorities making this model more cost effective and reliable for mobile cloud users. This approach can be useful in handling mobile data traffic of pandemic outbreak entries. In 2014, Wang et al. [2] proposed a hybrid mobile cloud computing model for medical monitoring, efficient diagnosis, large scale data processing, energy efficiency and execution efficiency. They argued that using their model, patients can manage their own health status in most convenient and affordable manner. In 2014, Xu et al. [50] furnished a semantic data model in order to store and access ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) data. They also developed a system that supports emergency medical services and provides flexibility to the user. This method is useful in a distributed heterogeneous data environment and is beneficial for healthcare support service providers to access large ranges of data sources in the mobile application environment. In 2015, Elsebakshi et al. [51] proposed a function network based optimization method for large scale medical data.",

High centralized infected users will have a high probability of spreading the outbreak.Definition 1Centrality of any userCentrality will represent the number of connections each user has on the global SNA graph. For any global SNA graph G\n = (V, E), let x* user has the highest centrality. Then centrality of graph G can be computed asC(G)=\u2211i=1V[C(x*)\u2212C(xi)](N\u22121)(N\u22122)where N is the total number of users.\nDefinition 2Closeness with infected userSometimes the user is not in direct contact with the H1N1 infected user, but knows another user who is in direct contact with H1N1 infected users. The closeness will study this relationship and will derive any user's shortest distance from infected and uninfected users. Closeness of any ith user with infected and uninfected patients can be calculated asClosenessi(Infected)=\u2211t\u2208V/udG(i,t)N\u22121andClosenessi(Uninfected)=\u2211t\u2208udG(i,t)N\u22121where d\nG(i, t) is the shortest distance between user i and t, u are the uninfected users, V is the set of all users and N is the total number of users in the global SNA graph.\nDefinition 3Relative score of each userThe relative score of a user will help to identify critical users from the global SNA graph.

Relative score S\ni of any user i can be computed asSi=1\u03bb\u2211j\u2208ViSj=1\u03bb\u2211j=1NAij*Sjwhere \u03bb is the eigen constant, A\nij is the adjacency matrix and V(i) is the set of nodes which are connected to ith node. A user with high score should be quarantined as early as possible.\nDefinition 4Chance of forming clustersFinding the probability for the formation of clusters of H1N1 infected patients in any region is of high importance. It will help the government agencies to seize that area and eliminate all kinds of travel from that region. Cluster Coefficient (CC) value is used in the proposed architecture to identify the probability of cluster formation.

Edge embeddeness can be computed as follows:EEij=#user   neighbor   of   i   and   j#user   neighbor   of   atleat   i   or   j\nGreater the value of EE\nij higher the chance of the cluster formation so, high probability of the spreading of the H1N1 outbreak.\n",

A giant component of the global SNA graph follows the trend of number of nodes and follow an exponential trend as depicted in Fig. 8(b). The overall centrality of the graph remains same around 50 in all ticks as shown in Fig. 8(c). This is because linking 50 users from pool of \u223c300 thousand users will not affect the overall centrality of the global SNA graph. Closeness of infected user is higher than uninfected users as shown in Fig. 8(d) and (e) because system has more uninfected user than infected user.

With the increase in information technologies, it is possible to control many infections in most effective and efficient way. In this paper, architecture is proposed for predicting and preventing an airborne H1N1 flu using cloud computing and Social Network Analysis (SNA). The random decision tree is used to classify users and cloud computing is used for effective information analysis and sharing. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA methods to represent each H1N1 flu infected users on a global SNA graph to show user's dependencies. Proposed system is implemented on Amazon EC2 cloud which provides 94% accuracy in classification and around 81% cloud resource utilization. It will help uninfected citizens avoid regional exposure and government agencies to address the problem more effectively. Future work will include secure transmission of information among different entities of the proposed architecture. We will also extend the proposed architecture for more generic diseases such as Hypertension, Diabetics and Cancer.",
