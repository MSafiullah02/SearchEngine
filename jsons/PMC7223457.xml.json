            "text": "bNAbs against HIV are able to recognize the envelope glycoproteins of diverse viral variants, often by targeting conserved epitopes that play important functional roles in the viral life cycle. After years of chronic infection, between 10% and 50% of HIV-infected individuals develop antibodies with neutralizing breadth in their serum, depending on the criteria used to define breadth1. Many HIV bNAb lineages have stereotyped genetic and structural features, such as high frequencies of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3) sequences. These sequence features are rare in healthy human antibody repertoires, but contribute to targeting vulnerable epitope sites on the HIV envelope glycoprotein2. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to bNAb formation is a priority for HIV vaccine development: vaccines eliciting bNAb-like antibodies could potentially protect against a wide range of HIV strains.",

It is possible that all individuals who are infected have a similar potential for producing bNAbs, but that formation of these antibodies is rate-limited by very rare stochastic events such as formation of naive B cells with particular CDR-H3 sequences, or the acquisition of particular somatic mutations during affinity maturation. In this model, bNAb lineages in each patient would be unusual outliers from the rest of their antibody repertoire. Alternatively, some infected individuals could be predisposed to generating bNAb-like antibodies due to systematic differences in their B cell repertoire formation or selection processes. In such patients, bNAbs would arise from a pool of many antibody lineages with similar features. Evaluation of germline allelic variants in antibody heavy-chain variable gene segments found no correlation with bNAb production3. However, other features of repertoire formation such as V(D)J segment recombination frequencies, CDR-H3 junction production, SHM frequency or differences in B cell selection could also affect the likelihood of producing bNAb-like antibodies. Factors such as the T cell populations providing help to B cells; regulatory T (Treg) cell populations that may control autoreactive B cells; or the mixtures and frequencies of HIV viral variants in the patient, could also lead to systematic differences in neutralizing antibody breadth between patients.",

Our results based on extensive sequencing of each patient\u2019s IGH repertoire indicate that HIV-infected individuals show significant perturbations of their antibody repertoires, including suppressed average SHM frequencies and increased frequencies of B cells expressing antibodies with features associated with autoreactivity. BNAb individuals each have hundreds to thousands of antibody lineages with long CDR-H3s and very high SHM frequencies. In contrast, noNAb subjects and HIV-uninfected individuals appear to select against antibody lineages with long CDR-H3 and high SHM frequencies. Further, we note that patient B cell and T cell phenotypes are linked, with a negative correlation seen between CTLA-4+ Treg cells and bNAb patient CDR-H3 lengths. An unrelated chronic viral infection, human cytomegalovirus, shows no evidence of eliciting the IGH repertoire deviations seen in bNAb HIV-infected individuals.

HIV-infected individuals showed overall decreases in mean SHM frequencies in IGH expressed as IgG but not in other isotypes, compared to uninfected individuals (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). bNAb individuals, however, had mean IgG SHM frequencies closer to those of uninfected people. Notably, the most highly mutated antibodies (represented here by the SHM value of the 99th percentile in the distribution of SHM frequencies in each participant) were more mutated in IgG subtypes of bNAb individuals compared to both uninfected controls and noNAb individuals (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The 99th percentile SHM values of IgG in bNAb individuals approach the SHM frequencies of well-described bNAb monoclonal antibodies isolated in previous studies (Fig. 1c), and are higher than the SHM of non-neutralizing antibodies or those elicited by vaccination in previous studies (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We noted that the standard deviation of SHM values for the clones within each individual was also higher in IgG subtypes in bNAb individuals compared to noNAb or HIV-uninfected individuals (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The antibody clonal lineages at the 99th percentile of mutation or higher, represent an average of 790 distinct clones (range 287\u20131,390) in each bNAb individual, rather than small numbers of outlier clones.",

IgA antibodies behaved differently from the other isotypes, having increased indel rates in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected individuals, even though their SHM frequencies were similar to those of uninfected controls.

We found that IgG subtype antibodies in both bNAb and noNAb individuals had longer CDR-H3s compared to uninfected individuals, as previously reported (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a)6. The fraction of very long CDR-H3 (>19 amino acids) was also higher in IgG subtypes HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected controls but did not differ between bNAb and noNAb individuals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Clones with >19 amino acids in their CDR-H3s represented thousands of distinct lineages in each participant (mean of 8,548 for bNAb individuals, 7,540 for noNAb individuals and 7,891 for uninfected individuals). To evaluate whether these CDR-H3 length differences could be attributed to the early steps of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) rearrangement in the bone marrow, we sequenced IGH rearrangements from a genomic DNA template and analyzed the sequences of unproductive rearrangements (the remnants of unsuccessful first attempts by the B cell precursor to rearrange the IGH locus). Nonfunctional rearrangement CDR-H3s were longer than productive ones but surprisingly, all HIV-infected individuals had shorter nonproductive CDR-H3s than uninfected individuals, with bNAb individuals having the shortest nonproductive CDR-H3s of all (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the increased proportion of IgG antibodies with CDR-H3 lengths exceeding 19 amino acids in HIV-infected individuals does not arise during BCR repertoire formation but is a consequence of subsequent B cell selection.",

We plotted the average CDR-H3 lengths for antibodies at the 70th, 80th, 90th, 95th and 99th or higher percentiles of SHM frequency in each patient\u2019s repertoires of each antibody isotype (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2c). bNAb-producing individuals showed a significant increase in CDR-H3 lengths in the most-mutated fractions of their IgG repertoires, in contrast to noNAb or uninfected individuals. Therefore, bNAb producers are distinct from noNAb individuals in the selection or persistence of B cells expressing antibodies with long CDR-H3 regions, particularly when these are highly somatically mutated. Previous studies have measured frequencies of gp120+ B cells in bNAb patient blood to be in the order of 30 per 30,000 (0.1%) IgG+ memory B cells and bNAbs to be 1\u20134 per 30,000 (0.003\u20130.01%) IgG+ memory B cells, suggesting that the SHM and CDR-H3 differences that we observe between bNAb and noNAb individuals are not due solely to HIV-specific gp120-binding B cell lineages7\u201310.",

As expected, both bNAb and noNAb individuals had lower CD4+ T cell frequencies than uninfected individuals (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and as previously reported, bNAb individuals had higher viral loads than noNAb individuals, although these average differences between groups were not sufficient to predict bNAb status (Supplementary Fig. 3c)11. The 99th percentile IgG SHM frequencies were positively correlated with CD4+ T cell frequencies and were negatively correlated with higher viral loads in noNAb individuals, but not in bNAb individuals (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). The data suggest that bNAb producers respond differently to their immunological environment (viral load and frequencies of CD4+ T cells; Supplementary Fig. 3f) and achieve very high SHM frequencies in numerous clones despite having lower CD4+ T cell frequencies than healthy individuals.",

Circulating T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells (CD25+Foxp3+ within CXCR5+CD4+ T cells) showed no correlation with CDR-H3 lengths (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and only a weak negative correlation with the 99th percentile IgG SHM frequencies in both bNAb and noNAb individuals (Supplementary Fig. 4c).

HIV viral loads were usually higher in bNAb individuals than noNAb individuals (Supplementary Fig. 3d). While this analysis cannot prove causation, and it is possible that these T cell populations are coordinately regulated with the B cell repertoires in study participants rather than directly affecting the B cells, the bNAb patients with the lowest frequencies of CTLA-4+ Treg cells had the longest CDR-H3s. The length of the longest CDR-H3s (99th percentile) in bNAb individuals showed a similar negative correlation with CTLA-4+ Treg cell frequencies.

Such convergent sequences could be useful for diagnostic purposes, identifying B cell repertoires that have been shaped by exposure to HIV and those that give rise to bNAb antibody types. Some convergent sequences would be expected to be HIV-specific, while others could be polyreactive, autoreactive or specific for other antigens. We searched for shared IGH sequences that were informative for distinguishing individuals who were HIV-infected from those who were HIV-uninfected. Individuals were scored based on the number of such shared sequences that they demonstrated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots showed that this classification scheme was effective for distinguishing individuals with HIV infection from those who were uninfected, achieving a >90% true positive rate with a <10% false positive rate, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 (Fig. 7a). The same approach, attempting to distinguish bNAb individuals from noNAb individuals performed less well, with an AUC of 0.72, but showed some discrimination between these groups. Selection of convergent clonotypes for these classifications was subjected to cross validation to minimize overfitting of the classifier, but we did not empirically test the binding specificity of the convergent antibodies identified. When we searched for the sequences of known monoclonal bNAbs that have been previously isolated from a few of the individuals in the bNAb patient cohort in this study, using a threshold of 80% nucleotide identity in CDR-H3, equal CDR-H3 length and the same IGHV and IGHJ gene segment usage, we identified bNAbs CH01, CH02, CH03 and CH04 in the IGH repertoire data from individual 0219; bNAbs DH511.1/2/3/6/7P/8P and DH511.4/5/10P in individual CH0210; and CH105 in individual CH0505 (refs. 9,16,17). At a CDR-H3 identity threshold of 75%, we also identified bNAbs CH103, CH104 and CH106 in individual CH505 (ref. 17). We did not find convergent antibodies to the known bNAb lineages in other broad-neutralizing individuals at these CDR-H3 identity thresholds. We infer that the antibody lineages responsible for HIV neutralizing breadth in these other individuals do not share high sequence identity with known bNAbs.",

We sequenced IGH repertoires in HIV-seronegative blood donors, of whom n = 52 were CMV-seropositive and n = 61 were CMV-seronegative. Individuals who were CMV-seropositive compared to those who were CMV-seronegative showed none of the IGH repertoire features seen in individuals who were infected with HIV and bNAb individuals, such as overall SHM differences in IgG isotypes (Supplementary Fig. 7a), 99th percentile SHM values in IgG isotypes (Supplementary Fig. 7b), CDR-H3 lengths (Supplementary Fig. 7c) or CDR-H3 fraction longer than 19 amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 7d), CDR-H3 lengths in progressively higher-SHM fractions of the IgG repertoires (Supplementary Fig. 7e) or IGHV4-34 usage (Supplementary Fig. 7f).

In contrast, CDR-H3s in productive IgG antibodies were longer in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected individuals, showing a strong selection for longer CDR-H3s. However, only the bNAb individuals showed selection favoring long CDR-H3 in the most highly mutated fractions of their antibody repertoires.",

SHM frequencies in bNAb individuals were not correlated with total CD4+ T cell or memory TFH frequencies in the blood. CTLA-4+ Treg frequencies correlated with CDR-H3 lengths in bNAb producers, opening the possibility that these cells may be involved, either directly or indirectly, in controlling CDR-H3 lengths in the maturing BCR repertoire of bNAb individuals. Alternatively, increased CTLA-4 expression in Treg cells in this context may primarily indicate that higher levels of Treg activation are present under conditions that also lead to shorter CDR-H3s. Transient modulation of immune checkpoints such as the CTLA-4 pathway during HIV vaccination has been proposed as a new approach to enable HIV-infected individuals to generate bNAbs. Any attempt to test this idea would need to include strategies to minimize autoimmune side effects, such as those seen in cancer immunotherapy trials24,25. Our analysis raises the hypothesis that CTLA-4 blockade could lead to HIV-specific antibodies with longer CDR-H3s.",

CTLA-4+ Treg cells show a strong negative correlation with CDR-H3 lengths in the BCR repertoires of bNAb producers, suggesting that this cell population, or CTLA-4 pathway manipulation more generally, could be targets for future strategies to improve neutralizing breadth generated by HIV vaccination. A major topic of current study is the way that differences in the HIV viral populations, such as the diversity, concentrations or epitope features of viral subpopulations, may affect the B cell phenotypes we observe. HIV-infected individuals produce characteristic \u2018convergent\u2019 clones with highly similar sequences detected in two or more individuals that are rarely detected in healthy people. These convergent clones indicate whether an individual is infected by HIV, although we have not determined whether all such clones are specific to HIV. We also find other clones that more weakly classify an individual\u2019s HIV neutralizing breadth. The accuracy of bNAb classification is enhanced in models that incorporate additional repertoire characteristics, but convergent clones alone are sufficient to predict HIV infection status accurately. As sequence data accumulate for human antibodies specific for various pathogens, vaccines and other antigens, it may become possible to use antibody repertoire data to predict an individual\u2019s responses to future immune stimuli and to improve vaccination strategies for challenging pathogens such as HIV.",

PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The PCR program was as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s) and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. A second PCR reaction to complete the Illumina linker sequence was carried out using the protocol in the previous section with the primers from Supplementary Table 5. Libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts, gel extracted and sequenced in two runs of the Illumina MiSeq instrument.",
