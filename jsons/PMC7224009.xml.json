Tigecycline, the first glycylcycline discovered, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2005 and entered the Chinese market in November 2011. It has been widely used since 2015 [1] and requires intravenous administration with a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg twice daily. Tigecycline has broad-spectrum activity; it inhibits protein synthesis by acting on the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking entry of aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules into the ribosome site [2]. Tigecycline is active against resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci [3]. The main indications for tigecycline are complicated intra-abdominal infection, complicated skin and skin-and-soft-tissue infection, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacteria sensitive to tigecycline.",

Among patients who received tigecycline during clinical trials, < 2% developed coagulopathy [6]. However, only six case reports [4, 7\u201311] and two clinical studies [5, 12] performed from 2000 to 2019 have focused on patients who developed hypofibrinogenaemia after tigecycline use, as indicated by an increased international normalized ratio (INR) and prolonged PT and APTT; in these cases, the hypofibrinogenaemia resolved after tigecycline discontinuation.",

            "text": "As high rates of treatment failure among patients treated with the standard of dose tigecycline have been documented [13\u201315], combination therapy and high-dose tigecycline are the options chosen by many physicians when facing severe infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Dong et al. [16] reported that combinations of rifampin/tigecycline and sulbactam/tigecycline show good in vitro activity against extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Another in vitro study revealed that combination therapies (tigecycline/colistin and tigecycline/sulbactam) could achieve lower mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) of tigecycline than tigecycline use alone [17]. A review showed that tigecycline plus sulbactam, carbapenem, or rifampicin showed synergistic effects against different bacteria [18]. Cefoperazone/sulbactam, the combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, is mostly used in China to treat severe bacterial infections and as a combination therapy with tigecycline to treat drug-resistant pathogens. It has low renal toxicity and high safety levels [19], but long-term high-dose use may lead to vitamin K\u2013dependent coagulation dysfunction. Hu [20] reported a fatal vitamin K\u2013dependent coagulopathy associated with cefoperazone/sulbactam in a 79-year-old man with normal coagulation function and no history of blood or liver disease. However, whether cefoperazone/sulbactam combined with tigecycline aggravates coagulopathy or hypofibrinogenaemia is unclear.",

Cunha and colleagues first reported that HD tigecycline is effective and it became the preferred dosing regimen for treating serious systemic infections due to susceptible and MDR pathogens [27]; thereafter, some studies confirmed HD tigecycline is associated with improved outcomes (including clinical outcome, microbiological eradication rate, increased survival time, and decreased mortality) compared with LD tigecycline [28\u201332]. However, a retrospective study including 134 patients who were diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) showed no significant difference in the incidence of 28-day mortality among different dose groups (LD, HD, and non-standard HD groups) [33]. In addition, a meta-analysis including 17 studies (11 studies from China, 3 published in English, and 8 in Chinese) showed that all-cause mortality for patients treated with HD tigecycline was significantly lower than that for patients treated with LD tigecycline; however, subgroup analyses by country showed no significant difference in the non-Chinese studies. The microbiological eradication rate of the HD regimen was also significantly higher than that of the LD regimen, whereas a non-Chinese study presented a negative result in the subgroup analyses [34]. Hence, both efficacy and safety should be taken into account when a physician chooses tigecycline as an antibacterial agent.",

Long-term high-dose use of cefoperazone/sulbactam can cause vitamin K deficiency, leading to reduced levels of vitamin K\u2013dependent coagulation factors and resulting in coagulation disorder. Although alteration of the microflora of the colon and the distal ileum, which synthesize vitamin K2, is a commonly cited mechanism of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy, the mechanism of hypofibrinogenaemia is unclear. It has been suggested that the tigecycline-mediated inhibition of cytokines interferes with fibrinogen production [9]. Sabanis et al. [4] showed that coagulopathy induced by the inhibition of MK-producing bacteria or by a direct effect on hepatic vitamin K activation and impaired liver function is implicated in the fibrinogen-level reduction. Furthermore, they recommended that the mechanisms be investigated, focusing on the role of genetic factors [4]. Therefore, further studies of the mechanisms underlying tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia are warranted.",

Second, we analyzed all pathogenic bacteria as a group but not individually, even though the presence of pathogenic bacteria is not a risk factor; a confounding bias might have been avoided if we had analyzed the presence of individual bacterial species in the study. Third, the heterogeneity of ICU patients limited the statistical analysis; further randomized controlled trials with larger cohorts or animal studies are warranted. Despite these limitations, we identified several clinical features and risk factors of tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia, which will facilitate further research in this field.",
