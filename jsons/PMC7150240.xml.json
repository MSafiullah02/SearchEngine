Life is greatly influenced by notorious accidents; however, efficient and well-defined tactics can be assumed to decrease the risk of massive losses. Like blasting and killing, attacks on food supplies do not smack terror in our hearts, but they should. The supply chain of the food industry has many points of susceptibility. Food contamination is the presence of harmful entities such as chemicals or other microbes which can cause consumer illness as well as degrade the quality of food. Providing a sustainable, safe, and secure food supply has been a challenging task which requires continuous monitoring of the food quality and quantity from production to consumption. Without an efficacious and productive detectable system, the food supply chain is subjected to contamination. The economies of many countries are dependent on agriculture, and therefore the agriculture sector is an attractive target for deliberate attacks. All the downstream food-related industries can be compromised after such attacks. Since the food supply chain has a global nature, there are numerous target points for deliberately contaminating the food by exotic pathogens (Gullino et al., 2008; Kingsolver et al., 1983). Agricultural resources comprise the foundation of producing food. With an increase in population, climatic changes, globalization of food business, biological weapons, and biocrime could represent major hurdles to the sustainable production of food (Stack, 2008). Lack of diagnostic infrastructure, global strategies, and a lack of awareness about food biosecurity represent critical issues. The current population of the world is above 7 billion. Among the major issues faced by governments of the present day is the widespread food insecurity for the increasing population. One out of nine people on the globe is undernourished, which leads to the death of 3.1 million children. With the decrease in farm lands due to urbanization and environmental changes leading to calamities like floods, our food supplies are stressed. There is a great need to review and potentially reform the global agriculture and food production system to meet the needs of people in the future.",

Agriculture contributes to about 24% of the overall GDP (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, n.d.), and absorbs nearly 45% of the human resources. About 62% of the human resources are estimated to be linked to agriculture directly or indirectly. Livestock has been a massive contributor (53.2%) to the agriculture setup in the form of fisheries, hatcheries, and poultries (Shinwari et al., 2014). Dairy farming is a popular business making Pakistan the third largest milk producing country. It contributes 11.7% to the GDP. Dairy farming has been the source of living for approximately 40 million people in Pakistan (The Nation, 2013). Meat represents a widely consumed food, with the consumption of poultry and beef on the rise over the past two decades. Over a time frame of just 11 years, the consumption of poultry has risen by 239%, from 322 million tons to 767 million tons from 2000 to 2010\u20132011 (Ahmad, 2011). Farm animals and crops are the potential targets for agricultural bioterrorism while other targets include items which are in the processing stage or distribution stage, processed food at the retail or wholesale level, and agricultural facilities such as food storage and processing facilities, transportation elements, food outlets, and research labs (Parker, 2002).",

Sometimes it focuses on plants or animals, and sometimes on microbes. Sometimes the biosecurity alarms are raised due to lab scale accidents while sometimes they are raised due to the intentional misuse of microorganisms. Sometimes dealing with a life to make it safe seems direct or simple (like the farm\u2019s sheep and cattle), but at other times many complex questions are hidden in this visible straightforwardness.

Since foods are traded globally, bioterrorism agents can easily disperse over the globe. Owing to these facts, international cooperation is needed to make an efficient system to contest bioterrorism. Biological weapons have been used for malicious purposes from ancient times to the present day, and have been executed by nonstate actors, criminals, and state enemies (Dudley and Woodford, 2002). The broad range of bioterrorists includes state enemies, state sponsored or military ambush, and individuals, among others (Zilinskas and Carus, 2000). Historically, plants and microorganisms or their derived toxins, contaminated blankets, animal carcasses, and infected human corpses have been used for bioterrorism. The work on bioterrorism has been for a long time ago; hence, it is not a new task (Hobbs, 2006; Kutz, 2013; Luning and Marcelis, 2009). Food and agricultural industries are particularly prone to bioterrorist activities, and although these threats may lack shock value, the economic consequences are immense. In sixth century BC, ergots were utilized by Assyrians to contaminate the wells of drinking water of their foes. Throughout the Krissa attack, flam cabbage was developed by Solon of Athens to defile the water supply. In 1996, research facility laborers at a vast restorative focus in Dallas, Texas, were welcomed through email to have muffins and doughnuts in the lunchroom. Eight people developed loose bowels and showed positive results for Shigella dysenteriae. One of the research facility laborers was the culprit. The FMD outbreak in 1997 led to a loss of $6.9 billion USD in addition to the loss of 50,000 jobs in Chinese, Taipei. Following the eradication of FMD, an additional $15 billion USD were spent on decontamination (Pearson, 2000). One million pigs were slaughtered in 1999 as a result of Nipah virus infection that lasted for about 3 months in Southeast Asia. In England, 3,900,000 animals were slaughtered, leading to a loss of $2 billion USD/day because of the notorious FMD outbreak in 2001 (Dudley and Woodford, 2002). These were accidental events which caused massive losses. A bioterrorist event can also have similar consequences. The food infrastructure is also prone to bioterrorist attacks. Some of the documented examples include the widespread food poisoning by the Rajneesh cult in Oregon, USA, in 1984. There were also attempts carried out by the Japanese-based \u201cAum Shinrikyo\u201d organization in the 1990s to spread anthrax and botulinum toxin (Parker, 2002). There are many more examples of how microorganisms can be a source of economic damages, already reviewed by (Shinwari et al., 2014).",

There are a number of interrelated repercussions. For example, the foremost consequence will be the immediate halt in the food production or at processing facilities until the time when the stocks are decontaminated. Depending on the scale of the devastation, there will be diagnostic and treatment services needed to stop the spread of the disease. Proper trainers must be hired to effectively dispose of the contaminated stocks. Overall, export markets will be lost and for a specified time restrictions will likely be in place. Loss of consumer confidence in the product or affected industry is another major issue. Another concern will be the changes in pricing. Let us assume a hypothetical scenario by considering two industries (A and B) of similar production nature. Let industry \u201cA\u201d be the one which has faced the event and is now under restrictions for a specified period. Such a situation will lead to the substitution effect in economic terms which means that eventually if products from industry A are not available, there will be an increase in demand for a similar product produced by industry B. Increasing demands can create scarcity of the product, which can lead to the increased price of the product. In addition, some government funds will be directed for the compensation of affected people. A recent example of the lapse in food safety was the presence of Salmonella in peanut butter in America, which led to the biggest recall of products in the history of United States that includes more than 200 downstream food manufacturers (Hobbs, 2006).",

Building the technical capacity to deal with these issues is therefore critical. Often the labs are understaffed or lack an expert or equipment (Wheelis et al., 2002). Zoopathological and phytopathological labs should be built with highly sensitive equipment (Shinwari et al., 2014).

Owing to these chaotic events, governments of developing countries and international donor agencies decreased investment in research and development and withdrew their support respectively (Zezza et al., 2007). An increase in rural poverty and reduction in agricultural productivity have been observed due to a lack of policy support without providing alternative solutions. Another important reason for the massive reduction in accessing food is lack of awareness of essentially interlinked sectors. This contributes to the poverty-food insecurity helix.
