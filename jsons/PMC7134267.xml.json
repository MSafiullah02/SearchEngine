Defining and assessing the maturity of different types of organizational resources allows organizations to evaluate their capabilities with respect to different business areas. In this context, for example, the maturity of certain organizational processes, objects or technologies can be the focus of such a reflection. Based on this concept, maturity models are multistage frameworks to describe a typical path in the development of organizational capabilities [12]. Here, the different levels are conceptualized in terms of evolutionary stages [13]. Maturity models can be described as normative reference models. In general, they are applied in organizations in order to assess the current status quo of a set of capabilities, to derive measures for improvement and prioritize them accordingly [1]. Through a set of benchmark variables and indicators for each stage, the matrix frameworks offer a possibility to make the progress of an object of interest towards a desired state tangible [14]. The relationship between maturity and organizational performance is properly understood, e.g. higher maturity leads to higher performance [15].",

It differs from a wider range of observations that is not subject to interpretation. A target\u2019s expected score over all possible performances in the target domain is defined as the target score.To determine the target domain and lay the foundation for the target score, the definition of the subject matter to be interpreted should be as specific as possible [9].

It is thus implied that a certain measurement is valid at any point of time; all context-specific factors are abandoned [19]. For this procedure, the measurement needs to involve a sample of performances from the target domain. Generalizability increases as the sample of independent observations increases. Also, standardization of the assessment procedure tends to improve the generalizability of the scores.

As a result the following keywords were compiled: \u201cmaturity model\u201d, \u201cstages of growth model\u201d. \u201cstage model\u201d, \u201cchange model\u201d, \u201ctransformation model\u201d, and \u201cgrid\u201d.

Lastly, when constructing the search strings, we used both the Boolean AND and OR to on the one hand link the major terms derived in the first step and on the other hand to incorporate these synonyms and alternative spellings in our systematic literature search.
