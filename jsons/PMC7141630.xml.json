Although knowledge of this novel coronavirus is emerging, the most common reason for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients is severe respiratory distress [1]. COVID-19 has been well described as causing a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state with marked elevations seen in Lactate Dehydrogenase, Ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-Dimer, and Interleukin levels [2,3]. While, COVID-19 cardiac complications are well described, an understanding of the role venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in the pandemic is still developing [4]. Few descriptions of the potential relationship between COVID-19 and VTE exist in the literature [5,6]. If an association between COVID-19 and VTE, particularly PE, exists then clinical features that are atypical for the novel coronavirus like hemoptysis, may aid emergency clinicians with identifying concurrent PE's during the current pandemic. This case illustrates the utility of clinical features that are atypical for COVID-19 infection in identification of concurrent pulmonary embolism with this novel disease.",

He had been previously diagnosed with mild COVID-19 infection twelve days prior to presentation. He was managed uneventfully at home until the day of presentation when he developed worsening exertional dyspnea, central pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis (estimated 10 ml). On presentation he was afebrile and demonstrated a normal heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, but he demonstrated a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. His physical exam revealed mild respiratory distress with bibasilar rhonchi but otherwise no other acute findings. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a D-dimer of 4.8 (\u03bcg/dl). Electrocardiography (EKG) showed show flattening of the T-waves in the inferior leads as compared to his prior EKGs with right axis deviation and a S1Q3T3 pattern (Fig. 1\n). Chest radiograph was significant for a right lower lobe infiltrate. Given his hemoptysis, evidence of right heart strain on his EKG and elevated D-dimer a Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest was obtained. The test revealed bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli and an additional area of consolidation in the right lower lobe concerning for infarct (Fig. 2\n). Additional findings of peripheral ground glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia were also noted. The patient was admitted to a negative pressure room, started on anticoagulation with heparin and eventually discharged to home on a novel oral anticoagulant.",

Additional research has suggested that these patients may have a mortality benefit from anticoagulation [7]. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002\u20132003 and H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 case reports described concurrent PE with viral lung infections [8,9]. Data from murine models suggests that SARS-CoV may interact with urokinase to produce a hypercoagulable state observed in SARS related acute lung injury [10].",

Elevated D-Dimer levels (>1.0 mg/dl) have been identified as a potential predictor of increased mortality, but are not specific to the diagnosis of VTE [11,12]. Reliance on D-dimer as a screening tool should be discouraged in this patient population and may lead to over utilization of Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) in a patient population already at risk for acute kidney injury [1,12] However, hemoptysis has been described as an infrequent COVID clinical symptom (0\u20135%) by retrospective analysis from Wuhan, China and may be useful in setting pretest probability [11,13]. For comparison, patients in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism (PIOPED) group were noted to have hemoptysis in 13% of PE cases [14]. Hemoptysis was also one of the clinical features with the highest association with PE in the final logistic regression model of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) [15]. In addition to clinical features like hemoptysis, signs of right heart strain on adjunctive bedside tests like EKG or point of care ultrasound maybe helpful for clinicians in identifying COVID-19 patients at risk for concurrent pulmonary embolism.",
