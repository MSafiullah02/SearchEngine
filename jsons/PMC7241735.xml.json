WRF was driven\nby the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\natmospheric reanalysis (ERA5)21 and provided meteorological inputs for\nthe CMAQ simulation. The WRF model performance was evaluated, showing good agreement with\nground-level observations (Figure S1). The CMAQ simulation covered the entire mainland China at the 36\nkm horizontal resolution and spanned the period from January 8, 2020, to February 6, 2020,\ncovering all days in periods I and II with the first 8 days for spinning up. To evaluate\nthe changes in air pollution associated with the meteorological conditions, the real-world\nmeteorology informed by the ERA5 reanalysis (Table S2) was used as inputs in the model simulation with fixed emissions\nfor 2017 because the real-time emissions for the study period were not available. This\nbrings in considerable uncertainties in model results as pollutant emissions in China are\nchanging,20 and moreover, significant changes were expected during\nthe specific COVID-19 period. The model here is primarily run to isolate impacts of\nmeteorology and emissions, and the results of the relative changes in air pollutant\nconcentrations from the modeling were adopted in subsequent analysis. Thus, the day-to-day\nvariations for the simulated concentrations of air pollutants were attributed to the\nimpacts of day-to-day meteorological changes as daily emissions were held constant over\nthe simulation period. The variations for observed pollutants concentrations were\nattributed to the mixed impacts of meteorological changes and emission changes.\nSubsequently, upon exclusion of the meteorological impacts modeled by CMAQ from the\nobserved overall changes in pollutant concentrations, the emission impacts on air quality\nbetween the two periods were isolated. The boundary layer plays an important role in air\npollution formation and dispersion; however, it should be noted that WRF and other\nregional models have difficulties in simulating the evolution of the boundary\nlayer.22,23\nTherefore, the impacts of meteorological factors may not be completely and accurately\ncaptured by the model. The model configurations and performance are detailed in the\nSupporting Information.",

We, as a proxy to test\nthe robustness of results, further run a sensitivity test by using a different model (the\nWeather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry, WRF-Chem)15 with a different emission inventory (2014 instead of 2017) to evaluate the\nimpacts of real-time meteorology on air pollution during this period.

Therefore,\nit could be inferred that the observed changes in the short-term air concentrations of\nPM2.5, PM10, CO, and SO2 in nearly half of monitored\ncities in the mainland China, and also NO2 in some cities (20%) during the\nstudy period, were primarily due to the meteorological changes, while for the increased\nO3 levels, emissions played a more important role.

In Beijing, the\nweekly average concentrations of most air pollutants except NO2 were higher\nduring period II than during period I, and the changes can be primarily explained by\nemissions. During the 2008 Olympic Games held from August 8 to 24 and the APEC summit of\n2014 held from November 7 to 12, the concentrations of all six air pollutants decreased in\nBeijing due to stringent controls. During those two events, except for the transportation\nrestrictions, some polluting factories in surrounding regions were also closed. During\nFLPHER, on the other hand, there was no intentional restriction on heavy industry.34 Additionally, different from those two previous events, the outbreak of\nCOVID-19 occurred during cold seasons when space heating was needed in northern China. It\nhas been well documented that fuel burning for space heating, especially in low-efficiency\nin-home heating stoves that burn coal and wood in the surrounding rural areas,\nsignificantly affects air quality.35",
