            "text": "Marburg virus, the prototype of the family Filoviridae, differs genetically, serologically, and morphologically from Ebola viruses. To better define the genetic variation within the species, VP35 and glycoprotein (GP) genes of representative human isolates from four known episodes of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever were analyzed. The percentage nucleotide differences in the GP gene coding regions of Marburg viruses (0.1\u00b121%) was nearly equal to the percentage amino acid changes (0\u00b123%), while the percentage nucleotide differences in VP35 coding regions (0.3\u00b120.9%) were higher than the percentage amino acid changes (0.9\u00b16.1%), indicating a greater number of nonsynonymous changes occurring in the GP gene. The higher variation in the GP gene and the corresponding protein, especially those changes in the variable middle region of the GP, suggests that the variability may be the result of responses to natural host pressures. Analysis of the GP gene open reading frame shows a nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous mutations that may indicate positive Darwinian selection is operating within the variable region. A heptad repeat region and an adjoining predicted fusion peptide are found in the C-terminal third of Marburg virus GPs, as has been previously shown for Ebola virus, and are similar to those found in transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses. Comparative analyses showed that there are two lineages within the Marburg virus species of filoviruses. The most recent isolate from Kenya (1987) represents a separate genetic lineage within the Marburg virus species (21\u00b123% amino acid difference). However, this lineage likely does not represent a separate Marburg subtype, as the extent of divergence is less than that separating Ebola virus subtypes.",

These differences are in agreement with studies that have shown a complete lack of serologic cross-reactivity, contrasting structural protein profiles, and differences in virion morphology between MBG and EBO viruses (Kiley et al., 1988; Ksiazek et al., 1992; Peters et al., 1993 Peters et al., , 1996 Feldmann et al., 1994 Feldmann et al., , 1996 Geisbert et al., 1996) . Isolates of MBG virus have tended to be fairly homogeneous, whereas EBO virus isolates appear more heterogeneous; four different EBO virus subtypes have been identified thus far . The heterogeneity of EBO viruses has also been demonstrated at the genetic level through sequence analysis of their glycoprotein (GP) genes . The nucleotide sequence differences between EBO subtypes varies from 37 to 41% (compared with a 55% difference between EBO and MBG viruses). For both MBG and EBO viruses, the GP genes are positioned fourth (3\u0408 to 5\u0408) in a series of seven linearly arranged genes and are the only genes to encode viral glycoproteins. The GP genes of EBO viruses were shown to have an unusual organization and to encode a nonstructural secreted glycoprotein (SGP) as the primary gene product in a single frame and the structural GP in two frames (expressed through transcriptional editing) Sanchez et al., 1996) . This unusual organization is absent in the GP genes of previously analyzed MBG viruses Bukreyev et al., 1995) .",

Its position (second) in the genome makes it analogous to the P proteins of paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses, but its function has not been conclusively identified.

For examination of VP35 gene sequences, first-strand DNA synthesis was performed using the primer 5\u0408-GCCTAGATGATAACAGATAT (plus-sense within NP gene and near polyadenylation site) and random primers (hexamer) as previously described (Sanchez et al., 1989) . DNA produced in reverse transcription (RT) reactions were diluted 1:50 in water and used as template in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. For amplification of the entire VP35 genes, either the primer 5\u0408-CTGTCTCAGCTAAGGAGCTTCA or 5\u0408-ATGATTCATATTATAAGGTAC (NP gene, plus-sense) and primer 5\u0408-GACGGTACCTTCCAGTAAAAGAACAC-TACGA were used with appropriate internal primers in PCR assays.

The second outbreak began when an Australian man became infected while traveling through what is now Zimbabwe, and who was later treated in Johannesburg, South Africa, where transmission led to two secondary cases (Gear et al., 1975) . The last two episodes occurred in Kenya in 1980 and 1987. The first of these is believed to have originated when a Frenchman working in Nzoia became infected and was transported to Nairobi for treatment, where he died and transmitted the disease to a Nigerian physician (MUS strain) (Smith et al., 1982) .

Figure 2 shows phylogenetic trees based on these nucleotide sequences. Both trees show a similar topology in that the EBO taxon is well separated from the MBG taxa and that the most recent MBG virus isolate (RAV) appears distinct from the other four MBG strains and is extremely well supported by bootstrap values (Felsenstein, 1993) . Relationships within the POP, RYC, MUS, and OZO clade in the VP35 tree are not fully resolved, as evidenced by poor bootstrap support for the node connecting MUS and OZO. A clearer relationship of these viruses is seen when GP ORF sequences are analyzed, with the 1980 MUS strain showing a greater similarity to the 1967 viruses than does the 1975 OZO strain.

In contrast, the middle of the GP alignment shows the greatest variation and is flanked by long conserved regions; the N-terminal region (signal sequence), however, does show a fair amount of divergence. The central variable region shows two marked boxes (totaling \u03f3200 residues) where most of the divergence in MBG sequences is located. The N-terminalmost box corresponds to a similar variable region found in the GPs of EBO virus species (EBO residues \u03f3300\u00b1 500) . Cysteine residues conserved in all the filoviruses are present in both proteins. Three are found in the VP35, while the GP alignment contains 5 in the N-terminal third and 7 in the C-terminal third. The highly conserved C-terminal \u03f3180 residues contain a sequence very similar to an immunosuppressive motif that has been described for the P15 glycoprotein of oncogenic retroviruses (Volchkov et al., 1992; Will et al., 1993) . This conserved sequence also partially overlaps an alpha-helical heptad repeat region (4-3 hydrophobic amino acids) (Chambers et al., 1990; Gallaher, 1996) . Immediately N-terminal to this helical region in all these viruses are predicted fusion peptides (Gallaher, 1996) . The GP alignment also shows that potential glycosylation sites are partly conserved. There are 14 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites that are found in all MBG strains, over half of which are located in the two variable boxes, and six sites are found in all MBG strains except for RAV, again located in the variable boxes. Nine sites are either unique to RAV or found in RAV and some of the other MBG strains, with all but one located in the variable boxes. These findings show that the central variable region is the area where N-linked glycosylation seems to be focused.",

Within Ebola viruses there are four separate monophyletic lineages that differ from one another by approxi-mately 37\u00b140% at the nucleotide level. However, within individual lineages, the variation in nucleotide sequence has been shown to be less than 2%, indicating a remarkable degree of stability over a 20-year period Georges-Courbot et al., 1997; Volchkov et al., 1997; A. Sanchez, unpublished data) . Our analyses of MBG virus VP35 and GP gene sequences indicate a somewhat different pattern for these filoviruses. The most recent isolate, the RAV strain (1987), represents a separate lineage of MBG virus, while the strains that preceded it constitute another lineage. Phylogenetic analyses using either VP35 or GP sequences clearly demonstrate this distinction, but the phylogenetic relationship of the 1967 (POP & RYC), 1975 (OZO), and 1980 (MUS) isolates was resolved for GP sequences only. It is interesting to note that the Zimbabwe isolate (OZO) is genetically closer to the Uganda (RYC & POP) and one Kenya strain (MUS) than is the most recent Kenyan isolate (RAV). This geographical discordance (\u03f3600\u00b1700 vs 100 km) may be explained if the natural host is a migratory species with a large range. Alternatively, this geographical inconsistency may merely reflect a divergence of the RAV strain following coevolution with a distinct natural host.",

In contrast, the nucleotide differences in VP35 ORFs (0.3\u00b120.9%) were higher than amino acid changes (0.9\u00b16.1%), which indicates that the number of nonsynonymous changes is greater in the GP gene than in the VP35 gene. This finding may indicate that the variation in the GP genes of MBG viruses are changes that have been selected for and have not occurred as purely random events. The greater variation in the MBG GP gene versus the VP35 gene is not inconsistent with the variation seen between glycoprotein and P genes of other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. It was previously shown that there is more variation in the GP gene of the POP and MUS strains of MBG virus compared with other genes (Bukreyev et al., 1995) . In addition, alignments of MBG or EBO GP amino acid sequences show that the middle portion of this molecule can be very divergent and is the primary site for N-and O-linked glycosylation (Sanchez et al., 1993) . It is possible that this variable region reflects the adaptation of filoviruses as they responded to natural host selective pressures. During this time, GP may have been under greater selective pressure than other virus proteins, possibly from phenotypic changes in cell receptors or the immune system of the natural host.",

            "text": "According to the theory of positive Darwinian selec- tion, nonsynonymous substitutions that cause adaptive amino acid changes are preferred over silent synonymous substitutions (Endo et al., 1996) . In the immunoexposed proteins of viral pathogens, the pressures of the host immune system are thought to drive positive selection of epitopes. The resulting antigenic polymorphism provides a mechanism for evading the immune response. Viral proteins thought to be evolving by positive Darwinian selection under immune pressure include the hemagglutinin gene of influenza and the env gene of human immunodeficiency virus (Fitch et al., 1991; Yamaguchi and Gojobori, 1997) . The strongly nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous changes in the MBG GP gene and presence of codons exhibiting high ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions strongly suggest that the GP is undergoing positive Darwinian selection. Mapping of epitopes within the MBG GP that are recognized by the vertebrate immune response will be necessary to confirm or refute this hypothesis. Processes in tissue culture or experimentally infected animals that lead to changes in virus phenotypes, whether through pressures from immune responses or some other selective mechanism, may be different from those acting in the natural host. There are differences between the POP strain of MBG virus, which was derived from a virus stock that had been passaged nine times in guinea pigs (Bukreyev et al., 1995) and the RYC strain that we sequenced (both derived from the 1967 outbreak in Marburg, Germany). It is likely that passaging in guinea pigs has led to the selection of a modified strain, which is phenotypically altered in the VP35 protein (three amino acid changes) from the initial virus, but has not led to a change in the GP amino acid sequence.",

            "text": "Depending on the area of the predicted amino acid sequences of the GPs of different filoviruses compared, they can appear either very conserved or extremely variable. The C-and N-terminal regions tend to be generally hydrophobic and contain long regions of conserved residues, whose functions include a signal sequence for directing the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum, and a transmembrane sequence to help anchor the molecule in the virion envelope. These regions are also likely to function in the formation of virion spike structures, since they contain most of the highly conserved cysteine residues. The central, hydrophilic, and variable region of the GP is a platform for the addition of glycans and is presumed to project outward from the virion. The predicted amount of N-and O-linked carbohydrate is considerable, accounting for a third to half of the molecular weight, and likely has a role in the resistance of the virion to neutralization by specific antibody. The positioning of a predicted fusion peptide adjoining heptad repeats N-terminal to the transmembrane anchor in filovirus GPs, initially shown for Ebola virus by Gallaher (1996) , is similar to motifs seen in the transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses (Chambers et al., 1990; Lambert et al., 1996; Chan et al., 1997) . The structural similarity of MBG and EBO GPs argues for a common mechanism by which filovirus GPs form trimers (Feldmann et al., 1991) and mediate virus entry into host cells. This shared mechanism of glycoprotein structure and function, especially with respect to filoviruses and oncogenic retroviruses (Volchkov et al., 1992; Sanchez et al., 1996; Gallaher, 1996) , points to either a common ancestral gene sequence or convergent evolution. The current taxonomy of the family Filoviridae places MBG and EBO viruses into a single genus, Filovirus. However, it is apparent from our phylogenetic analyses, together with prior studies that described important differences in the biology of these viruses (Kiley et al., 1988; Feldmann et al., 1992 Feldmann et al., , 1994 Sanchez et al., 1993 Sanchez et al., , 1996 Volchkov et al., 1995) , that EBO and MBG viruses can readily be classified into separate genera. In our opinion, the four EBO subtypes should be considered as separate species, and MBG strains should all be placed in a single species. An earlier study of the RAV strain of MBG virus suggested that this virus represented a new subtype, comparable to that seen with EBO subtypes (Johnson et al., 1997) . Our GP gene finding that RAV differed \u03f321\u00b123% from that of the other MBG strains (at both nucleotide and amino acid level) is slightly more than half that found between EBO species. We believe that this level of difference is insufficient to consider RAV as a separate MBG species, but is sufficient to be regarded as a subspecies or variant. To better characterize the MBG lineage, it will be necessary to analyze additional novel isolates. However, as with EBO, identification of such viruses has relied on rare outbreaks in human and nonhuman primates, although this obstacle should be greatly reduced when the natural reservoir is eventually determined.",
