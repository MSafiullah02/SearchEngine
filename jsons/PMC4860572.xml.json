Extracted DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), purified, and hybridized to Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon (50 M) human exome array for enrichment. Hybridized fragments were bound to strepavidin beads whereas non-hybridized fragments were washed out after 24 h. Captured LM-PCR products were subjected to Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer to estimate the magnitude of enrichment. Each captured library was then loaded on Hiseq2000 platform, and high-throughput sequencing for each captured library was performed.

Low-quality read was defined as more than half of a read was constituted with low quality bases (less than or equal to 5) or a read in which unknown bases were more than 10%. Picard (v1.54) (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) was used to mark duplicates. Subsequently, BAM files (sequence alignment/map format) were compressed to SAM files (the binary files of BAM files). SNPs (Single-nucleotide polymorphism) and InDels (Small insertions/deletions) were detected by module Unified Genotyper of GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit v1.0.6076). And then ANNOVAR was used to do annotation and classification for SNPs and InDels respectively. Our data have been identified by dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi), 1000 human genomes database (www.1000genomes.org/) and BGI\u2019s inhouse control database. We used BGI\u2019s inhouse control, most controls coming from a Whole Exome Sequencing based study of genetic risk for psoriasis which has been published9, and the controls comprised 800 normal people across the whole country. These inhouse control cases were specially used for analysis of rare diseases. Considering only 33 patients had confirmed H7N9 infection in Shanghai, and large population exposed to risk factors, the H7N9 infection was a low possibility case, and could be considered as rare disease, so this control data could be used in this study. We collected 40 genes which were correlated with avian influenza from HuGE Navigator by keyword search with \u201cinfluenza\u201d and extracted 89 exonic SNVs (single nucleotide variations) (Supplementary Dataset 1) located in 27 genes (Table 3) of the 40 genes from SNPs result.",

These SNPs were subjected to Sanger sequencing in all the 18 patients and 64 exonic SNVs were verified. We compared the mutation rate of the case and the inhouse control using the Fisher Exact Test and found significant statistical difference (Supplementary Dataset 1 and Table 4). There were 17 SNVs significantly different between the case and the inhouse control and we have validated 16 of them by Sanger sequencing (Table 7). The 16 validated SNVs were located in 12 genes, and the protein-protein interaction among them (Fig. 3) was consistent with the protein-protein interaction among the 21 genes done before (Fig. 2). It is more likely that both the genes identified from this study that showed statistical difference of mutation frequency and the genes with same mutation rate between patients and controls have participated in the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus infection. We also did Mann-Whitney U test between the first 8 patients and the additional 10 patients and none of P-value was significant (Table 4), which could prove the inhouse control data do not introduce any false signals. Moreover, We compared the mutation rate of death group and survival group and analysis the mutation rate by Mann-Whitney U test and no significant difference was found between the survival and non-survival group (Table 4), suggesting some of genes identified in this study may be associated with H7N9 influenza susceptibility.",

            "text": "The 2013 Chinese H7N9 influenza outbreak lead to an estimated 48 deaths with 33% mortality and significant morbidity in patients who survived the virus. An important observation during the recent H7N9 outbreak in China was the wide variation in host response to infections, with some patients developing only mild upper respiratory tract infections, while other patients developed severe ARDS and died. Although several determinants of the host response to infection have been identified, many important genetic factors that dampen or exacerbate the host response to H7N9 infection likely remain undiscovered. Previous studies suggested that genetic mutations in the protein machinery that comprise key host defense mechanisms could impact outcomes of influenza infection12. The differential susceptibilities to influenza A(H7N9) were affected by functional variants of LGALS1 causing the expression variations13. The H7N9 influenza outbreak in China provides an unique opportunity to study mutations in this machinery, because many poultry workers were exposed to the virus, yet comparatively few became infected. This may suggest that genetic mutations in host defense mechanisms could be responsible for the selectivity of H7N9 infection. Others have identified genes that are protective during influenza infection, including MX1, NCR1, CCR5, IFITM3 and IL1014. Mutations in these genes may lead to increased host susceptibility to infection or to a heightened, and potentially deleterious, host response to infection. We hypothesized that the exome sequencing of these patients may reveal genetic mutations that increased susceptibility to viral infection, and that in the future, these mutations could provide information regarding risk of infection, especially poultry workers or family members of infected patients.",

Among these genes, some have been identified in prior studies of H7N9 susceptibility genes14. For example, Wang et al. reported that IFITM3 dysfunction is associated with increased cytokine production during H7N9 infection and is correlated with mortality14. IFITM3 (chr11, 320772, A >  G) was reported to be enriched in patients hospitalized due to H1N1/09 infection15. Polymorphisms of CPT2, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 protein, were found in patients suffering from influenza-associated encephalopathy; results of overexpression of CPT2 variants in vitro suggested that the variants were heat-labile and failed to perform optimally during fever1617. Four disease outcome-associated SNPs were identified on chromosomes 17 (RPAIN and C1QBP), chromosome 1 (FCGR2A), and chromosome 3 (unknown gene). C1QBP and GCGR2A play roles in the formation of immune complexes and complement activation, suggesting that the severe disease outcome of H1N1 infection may result from an enhanced host immune response1216.",
