Initially believed to have originated in animals, it was later shown to be able to spread from person to person [2, 3]. On January 21, 2020, the COVID-19 was classified into a category B infectious disease of high priority requiring countrywide management measures (category A management measures) in China. On January 30, WHO declared that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of March 26, 2020, there have been 552,943 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in 200 countries and regions, including 399,192 active cases, 25,045 deaths, and 128,706 cases recovered. On March 2, the European CDC raised the SARS-CoV-2 risk level from moderate to high. Almost the entire globe is now designated by the US CDC as under a class 3 travel advisory. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Global travel has been severely restricted and mass quarantine measures have been implemented in almost every country.",

Abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) has been used to diagnose 67.4\u201388.0% cases of COVID-19, indicating that pneumonia is the most common manifestation of the disease [4\u20136]. Therefore, CT imaging is widely used in the early diagnosis of the disease, but chest CT may not distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias [7\u20139]. Nucleic acid assay, gene sequencing, and serology examination (IgM and IgG) from throat swabs or blood samples have been developed to establish a pathologic diagnosis [7]. However, clinicians in Wuhan have raised the issue of high false negative rate of PCR or antibody detection [10]. Combination use of medical history, clinical manifestations, chest CT, and the viral test has been found to have high sensitivity (92\u201397%) [5, 6]. Based on current understanding of COVID-19, the Chinese government regularly provides an updated clinical protocol to guide screening tactics to manage COVID-19 in epidemic areas. Globally, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is still a major challenge.",

Thus, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined [11, 12]. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the sequence homology was 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, rather than the earlier SARS-CoV (sequence homology less than 80%). Therefore, the Chinese chrysanthemum bat was speculated to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [13\u201315]. Further investigation identified that pangolin might be a potential intermediate host because the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the genomic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower compared with Pangolin-CoV than Bat-CoV-RaTG13 [16\u201319]. These findings suggest that further studies are required to trace intermediate hosts in the jump from bats to humans.",

            "text": "In mid-January 2020, studies of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed person-to-person transmission [2, 3, 22]. Close contact with symptomatic individuals constitutes the major risk for extensive transmission. Ongoing spread may rely on unknown transmission by asymptomatic hosts [20]. Guan et al. reported that of the 3.5% of infected patients who were identified as healthcare workers, 1.9%, 31.3%, and 72.3% of patients had a history of contact with wildlife, recent traveled to Wuhan, and contact with people from Wuhan, respectively [4].Respiratory droplets\u2014SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets [2, 4, 7, 20]. When a patient coughs or sneezes, aerial droplets containing virus may be inhaled by susceptible individuals.Direct contact\u2014Guan et al. found that 71.8% of non-local residents developed COVID-19 due to contact with individuals from Wuhan [4]. More than 1800 of 2055 (~ 88%) medical workers with COVID-19 were in Hubei, according to reports from 475 hospitals [20].Indirect contact\u2014this occurs when droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 land on the surface of tabletops, doorknobs, telephones, and other inanimate objects. The virus is transferred from the surface to the mucous membranes by contaminated fingers touching the mouth, nose, or eyes [23]. Studies have estimated that SARS-CoV-2 can exist for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C and a humidity of 40\u201350% and can survive for less than 48 h in dry air, with a reduction in viability after 2 h [24].Asymptomatic transmission\u2014asymptomatic infections have been reported in at least two cases with exposure history to a potentially pre-symptomatic patient who was later diagnosed with COVID-19. The virus was then transmitted to another three healthy family members [25, 26]. Prior to the development of symptoms, individuals may not be isolated and may constitute an important mobile viral source. This transmission contributes to the difficulties in containing the spread of the disease [27, 28].Interfamilial transmission\u2014transmission within family clusters is very common. One study reported that 78 to 85% of cases in large aggregate groups occurred due to interfamilial transmission in Sichuan and Guangdong, China [20].Aerosol transmission\u2014in a closed environment with poor ventilation, aerosols may remain airborne for 24\u201348 h and spread from several meters to dozens of meters [7, 29, 30]. However, there has been no strong evidence for aerosol transmission. The WHO also deemed that this route requires further investigation [31, 32].Ocular transmission\u2014it has been reported that a doctor without eye protection was infected during an inspection in Wuhan on January 22, 2020 [33]. Further studies found that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of COVID-9 patients [34, 35].Fecal-oral transmission\u2014this was first reported in a COVID-19 case in the USA [21]. Subsequent studies detected SARS-CoV-2 in the feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 patients [4, 36]. Furthermore, 23.3% of COVID-19 patients remained SARS-CoV-2 positive in feces even when the viral RNA was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia [37].",

Fever was the most common symptom (91.7%, 411/448), followed by cough (67.2%, 301/448), fatigue (52.5%, 235/448), dyspnea (45.1%, 178/395), sputum production (36.1%, 103/285), anorexia (29.3%, 39/133), myalgia or arthralgia (22.2%, 71/320), chills (18.2%, 37/203), sore throat (15.3%, 40/261), and headache (11.6%, 39/337). The clinical manifestations of the 448 pooled severe cases are summarized in Table 1 [4, 11, 45\u201352].Severity\u2014China\u2019s CDC has reported 44,672 cases, with 80.9% being mild or moderate cases, 13.8% severe cases, and 4.7% critical cases. The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3% and 81% of the deaths occurred in patients over 60 years of age. The mortality rate of critical cases was 49% [43].Comorbidities\u2014COVID-19 patients with comorbidities showed higher mortality. In Guan\u2019s study, 25.1% (399/1590) of the confirmed cases reported having at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (16.9%), diabetes (8.2%), and cardiovascular diseases (3.7%) [53]. In another study, hypertension (39.7%), cardiovascular diseases (22.7%), and diabetes (19.7%) were the most common underlying diseases among 1023 deaths [43].Complications\u2014critical cases may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even death. Among the 448 severe cases, complications were reported in 274 patients [4, 11, 45, 48]. The most common complication was pneumonia (76%, 171/225), followed by ARDS (34.7%, 95/274), acute cardiac injury (23.8%, 24/101), septic shock (11.3%, 25/222), and acute kidney injury (9.5%, 26/274).\n\n",

RT-PCR was positive in 59 to 78.2% of cases [5, 6, 61]. This assay may detect the viral RNA in the early stage of clinical symptoms even with negative CT findings [62]. Gene sequencing can identify SARS-CoV-2 accurately, but the major disadvantages are that it is very time-consuming and expensive. Gene sequencing is more important for research on the variants and origin of SASR-CoV-2 [20]. Based on recent data in 397 cases, specific IgM, specific IgG, and specific IgM + specific IgG had a sensitivity of 18.1%, 6.0%, and 64.5%, respectively [63]. Serological assays require only 15 min to generate results and can be used for rapid screening in clinics [63].\nb)Routine tests\u2014in Guan\u2019s study [4] of 1099 confirmed patients, lymphopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. Changes in albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were seen in SARS-CoV-2 infections.c)Potential biomarkers for severity\u2014significantly higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, and procalcitonin were associated with disease severity (Table 2). Huang reported that prothrombin time and D-dimer levels on admission were higher in intensive care unit (ICU) patients than in non-ICU patients [11]. Plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher in ICU patients. In Wang\u2019s study [45], ICU patients had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as higher levels of D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine. Severe patients demonstrated lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe and non-severe patients.\n\n",

Gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon, which is different from SARS-CoV [65] and MERS-CoV [66] infection. Further investigations to clarify the viral tropism of SARS-Cov-2 are important for understanding its transmission and treatment. Older patients (> 65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at an increased risk of death, and men seem more likely to be infected than women. The overall mortality rate is estimated to be 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44,762 confirmed cases of COVID-19), based on experience within China [67]. Compared with greater than 10% mortality of SARS-CoV [68] and 35% mortality of MERS-CoV [69], SARS-Cov-2 has a lower mortality rate but appears to be more contagious. The mortality rate may be even lower in the real-world setting once the infection has stabilized. Many studies may not include mildly ill patients who did not seek medical help. Xu\u2019s study [70] found that compared with patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang Province were relatively mild. There is a potential association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resources [71], and the mortality rate outside Wuhan may be much lower.",

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may primarily attack lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocytes, as SARS-CoV does [73]. Virus particles infect cells, inducing a cytokine storm in the body, generating a series of immune responses, and causing changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells. Consequently, the low absolute value of lymphocytes may be used as a reference index in the diagnosis or to classify severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections [74]. At present, it is possible to predict prognosis using symptoms, signs, and imaging findings, but there are challenges. Symptoms, signs, and imaging abnormalities are often seen later in the disease course, so early detection may be difficult. In addition, once the condition deteriorates, it may lead to a vicious circle ultimately resulting in critical illness or death. The care of these patients requires a high level of medical resources, equipment, and infrastructure. Slowing the spreading of the disease helps to \u201cflatten the curve,\u201d which helps to prevent overtaxing of healthcare systems.",

The clinical and epidemiology characteristics summarized in studies from Wuhan may be impacted by a shortage of medical resources in Wuhan [71]. The experience in cities and countries outside of Wuhan, China, may be different as the virus has undergone mutations even since its first appearance in December 2019 [70]. There is also a lack of information regarding communicability in the early phases of the disease in patients who have not yet manifested symptoms of COVID-19 or in asymptomatic carriers. Clinical information in some patients who have COVID-19 may be lacking as a result of failure to seek treatment in early stages with mild presentation, or a lack of awareness of the disease, although by now most people are vigilant or even hypervigilant. A shortage of detection kits can also hinder identification and confirmation of infected individuals [75]. These limitations can impact the accuracy of prior research. Lastly, because many patients are still ill in the hospital, the prognosis and the outcomes are incompletely elucidated. Most of the current studies are cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies are required.",
