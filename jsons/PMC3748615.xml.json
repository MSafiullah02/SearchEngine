            "text": "Mammalian pregnancy poses a unique challenge for the maternal immune system; tolerance needs to be maintained to the semi-allogenic fetus while effectively retaining immune reactivity to protect the mother and fetus from deleterious effects of infections. Infectious agents can reach the feto-placental compartment either through the hematogenous route or ascend the genital tract. Interestingly, the amniotic fluid and fetal-maternal membranes are often not sterile even in healthy term pregnancies (Witkin et al., 2011). Therefore, clearly mechanisms must be operative to prevent and/or limit microbial proliferation and/or its pathological consequences at the feto-maternal interface. Indeed, the placenta has been suggested to act as fortress against infections (Robbins and Bakardjiev, 2012). Nevertheless, some pathogens breach the placental barrier or intrude the amniotic cavity leading to excessive inflammation recognized as a major cause of pre-term birth (Redline, 2004). A strong maternal cell-mediated immune response to infection can also compromise fetal health even in the absence of pathogens in the reproductive mucosa (Krishnan et al., 1996b). Much of our knowledge on immunity to infection during human pregnancy is gained from retrospective epidemiological studies or in vitro infection of placental cultures. Experimental infection evoked in pregnant mice is an excellent tool to elucidate in vivo mechanisms of maternal resistance to infection and fetal tolerance to pathogen-associated danger signals. This review commences with a commentary on the suitability of mice as a model to study human gestation and immunity to infection. It then focuses on the various murine models of infections in pregnancy (Table 1\n) and their clinical relevance concluding with potential future avenues of research.",

Similar to humans, the harmonized action of progesterone and estrogen secreted from the corpus lutea prepares the uterus for implantation. Uterine circulation is provided through blood vessels bundled at one side, named the \u201cmesometrial side\u201d (Lim and Wang, 2010). Attachment of the blastocyts to the luminal epithelium on the opposite side (anti-mesometrial side) occurs between days 4.0 and 4.5 and coincides with increased vascular permeability. The luminal epithelium undergoes apoptosis allowing the blastocyt to attach to the uterine lining and trophoblastic cells burrow the stroma inducing cell proliferation (decidualization). The maternal decidua lining encases the fetus and placenta initially but upon placentation is reduced to a thin anterior cap of cells. Intriguingly, even though human gestation is 280 days, the window of implantation is early, 5\u20139 days after ovulation and the processes are similar to those described for mice above (Lim and Wang, 2010).",

            "text": "The placenta is a vital organ with physiological, endocrine and immunological functions. Both mice and humans have an invasive hemochorial placenta resulting in close opposition of fetal and maternal blood and cells (Fig. 1\n). The trophoblast layer of the placenta arises from the outer trophectoderm of the blastocyst, and trophoblast differentiation can be discerned by day 4.5 (Rossant and Cross, 2001). The distinct trophoblast layers that comprise the mouse placenta include; the labyrinth (comprising the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast, villous chorionic trophoblast, blood vessels and stroma) which is supported by a compact layer of non-syncytial spongiotrophoblast and an outermost layer of giant trophoblast cells. The maternal blood supply passes the sphongiotrophoblast via a large central spiral artery which is remodeled post-implantation when trophoblast cells erode the endothelial cells. The maternal blood enters into tortuous spaces in the labyrinth where it bathes directly with the fetal villi, ensuring easy material exchange between the maternal and fetal blood systems. The fetal vasculature of the placenta is connected to the developing fetus by the umbilical cord (Fig. 1). In humans the extensive spiral artery remodeling culminates in the chorionic villi structure comprised of the syncytiotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast that is bathed in maternal blood (Fig. 1) and is analogous in function to the labyrinth of the mouse placenta. The outer column of the cytotrophoblast and extra villous trophoblast (akin to giant trophoblast cells in mouse) comprise the invasive interface with the uterus (Rossant and Cross, 2001).",

Murine gestation has served as a convenient model to map the localization and movement of immune cells at the feto-maternal interface using techniques such as flow cytometry, histochemistry and most recently whole mount staining microscopy (Croy et al., 2012). The emerging concept is that immune cells at the feto-maternal environment are predisposed to tolerance in the absence of sufficient \u201cdanger\u201d signals (Mor, 2008). Below, we provide a brief description of the immune cells and their temporal regulation in response to the changing needs of the fetus.",

            "text": "The maternal decidua comprises as much as 30\u201340% leukocytes in early pregnancy and the major subsets include uterine NK (uNK) cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells (Warning et al., 2011). Decidualization is tightly regulated inflammatory process which prepares the uterine bed for blastocyst implantation. Firstly, dendritic cells and uNK cells regulate stromal cell differentiation and the vascular response associated with spiral artery remodeling (Blois et al., 2011). In mice, the number of DCs and uNK cells increase at the feto-placental interface coinciding with implantation (Blois et al., 2011). The numbers of uNK cells increases to 50\u201370% of the leukocyte population by day 7, declining substantially in numbers by gestational day 9 (Croy et al., 2012). Depletion of DCs precipitates implantation failure (Krey et al., 2008). In the human endometrium, uNK cells emerge immediately post-ovulation (Blois et al., 2011). In mice depletion of uNK cells results in a hypo-cellular and necrotic decidua, but more importantly an undilated spiral artery and abnormal placental architecture (Croy et al., 2003, Guimond et al., 1997). Peripheral NK cells are cytotoxic, whereas uNK cells have distinct phenotype and function (Croy et al., 2003, Moffett-King et al., 2002). Firstly, uNK cells are CD56bright/CD16 (Moffett-King et al., 2002) in contrast to peripheral NK cells that are CD56dim/CD16+ (Campbell et al., 2001). CD16 is directly involved in triggering lysis of target cells, thus uNK cells lacking CD16 expression exhibit reduced cytotoxicity and switch function to IFN\u03b3 production (Croy et al., 2003, Moffett-King et al., 2002). The uNK cells invade the decidua basalis, which in both humans and mice triggers production of factors and cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IFN\u03b3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-\u03b2 and IL-15 that facilitate successful implantation by modulating uNK cell maturation, angiogenesis and trophoblast differentiation (Blois et al., 2011, Croy et al., 2003). Importantly, uNK cells and DCs cross-regulate the function of the other during decidualization to balance angiogenesis with overt inflammation (Gonzalez et al., 2012).",

Macrophages (M1) activated under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines and danger signals secrete inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-12, whereas M2 macrophages are polarized by exposure to Th2 cytokines and are characterized by enhanced scavenger and mannose receptors, reduced nitric oxide and IL-12 production (Sica and Mantovani, 2012). The polarization of decidual macrophages to the M2 phenotype has been seen in both murine and human pregnancy (Nagamatsu and Schust, 2010) and may be a mechanism of regulating immune tolerance. However, a recent report of human decidual macrophages suggests a greater plasticity among CD15+ decidual macrophages which may be either CD11chi or CD11clow capable of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses respectively (Houser et al., 2011). Indeed, decidual macrophage functions are important to control response to infections, as depletion of macrophages was shown to increase susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice (Guleria and Pollard, 2001).",

Indeed, a number of murine models have demonstrated that induction of allo-specific T cells can evoke abortion whereas T cell tolerance to allogeneic antigens is a hall-mark of successful pregnancy (Erlebacher, 2010). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that epigenetic silencing of chemokine receptors on the decidua prevents the accumulation of activated effector T cells (Nancy et al., 2012). However, even allo-antigen non-specific T cells may produce inflammatory cytokines that may have by-stander damaging effects on the fetus. An immunoregulatory role for the placenta in modulating a Th2 cytokine environment in successful pregnancy was first proposed by Wegmann et al. (1993). However, human and mouse trophoblast cells produce and/or respond to both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (Lin et al., 1993, Murphy et al., 2009). Furthermore, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 gene-deficient mice exhibit normal pregnancy, suggesting that successful pregnancy can occur in the absence of a predominant Th2-biased response (Saito et al., 2010). In contrast, IFN\u03b3, TNF and stimulation of TLRs that augments a Th1 response result in resorptions in mice (Chaouat et al., 1990) indicating a need to dampen this response. Thus, regulatory mechanisms operate at the feto-maternal interface to down-modulate both allo-specific T cell responses and damaging inflammation that may ensue from activation of T cells (D\u2019Addio et al., 2011, Guleria et al., 2005).",

            "text": "T regulatory cells (Tregs) are a major class of CD4+ T cells that express the transcription factor Foxp3 and suppress immune responses against \u201cself\u201d and foreign antigens in a variety of physiological and pathological settings (Allan et al., 2008). Two subsets of Tregs have been recognized; thymic or peripheral origin; the latter differentiating from CD4+ T cells when binding their cognate antigen in the presence of TGF\u03b2 and absence of IL-6 (Allan et al., 2008). In humans augmented Th1-type immunity and decreased Tregs are observed following implantation failure in assisted reproduction (Saito et al., 2010). Unexplained infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortion are also associated with reduced expression of Tregs (Saito et al., 2010). Maternal Tregs are already increased in the lymph node of pregnant mice by days 2\u20133 of mating (Aluvihare et al., 2004, Zenclussen et al., 2006), and are evoked by the seminal plasma suggesting early induction of anti-paternal tolerance (Guerin et al., 2011). However, the expansion of Tregs occurs in both allogenic and syngenic murine mating (Aluvihare et al., 2004). Nevertheless, depletion of Tregs results in pregnancy loss in allogeneic but not syngenic mating (Aluvihare et al., 2004). Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Tregs from normal pregnant mice rescues fetal rejection in abortion-prone matings (Zenclussen et al., 2006). A pivotal recent study has shown that peripheral Foxp3 enhancer conserved sequence 1 (CNS1) that is essential for peripheral Treg differentiation is present only in placental mammals, and CNS1-deficient mice exhibit high levels of inflammation, abnormal spiral artery remodeling and fetal resorptions (Samstein et al., 2012). Thus, it has been suggested that the extrathymic differentiation of Tregs has been specifically gained during evolution of placental mammals to reinforce tolerance to paternal alloantigens presented by the fetus during prolonged gestation (Samstein et al., 2012).",

Furthermore, a role for IL-6 trans-signaling to drive the conversion of Tregs to Th17 cells in recurrent spontaneous abortion has been suggested (Saito et al., 2010). Similarly, a bias toward Th1/Th17 and away from Treg/Th2 cells and cytokines are reported in pre-mature labor and pre-elampsia in women (Saito et al., 2010). In mice as Th1 cytokines, TLR stimulation or depletion of Treg cells can evoke resorptions (Aluvihare et al., 2004, Chaouat, 2003), mechanistically this may relate to a Treg/Th17 imbalance. Indeed, many intracellular infections that are detrimental to pregnancy induce IL1\u03b2 and IL-6 cytokine production that can trigger a conversion of Tregs to Th17 cells (Chaudhry et al., 2009). Furthermore, other regulatory molecules such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expressed by the trophoblasts suppress Th17 differentiation (Baban et al., 2004, Baban et al., 2009). In conclusion, we surmise that the adaptive immunity at the feto-maternal interface is delicately balanced between a Th2/Treg and Th1/Th17 phenotype to protect the fetus from allo-recognition while providing sufficient plasticity to counter infectious threats.",

For decades, it has been appreciated that cell-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis is ameliorated (Klipple and Cecere, 1989) whereas antibody mediated disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosis (Hayslett, 1991), is exacerbated during pregnancy. The Th2 response during pregnancy normally results in vigorous antibody responses and can effectively eliminate most extracellular pathogens (Jamieson et al., 2006). We first demonstrated using a murine model, the bi-directional cross-talk between pregnancy and Th1 immune response to infections; Leishmania major increased adverse pregnancy outcome in infected mice even in the absence of placental infection (Krishnan et al., 1996b). Conversely, the Th2 bias in pregnancy increased maternal susceptibility to L. major (Krishnan et al., 1996a). Infections that are threat to the pregnant mother may be extra-uterine or colonize the reproductive mucosa. The effects of infection in human pregnancy are revealed during epidemiological analysis of outbreaks. However, it is challenging to unravel the mechanism and dynamics of feto-maternal cellular interactions that influence in vivo infection by utilizing in vitro human placental cultures. Finally, select group of viruses, bacteria, parasites all pose increased threat during pregnancy, yet there is little commonality in their mechanisms of pathogenesis. Murine feto-placental infection models have increased our knowledge of modulation of immunity to infection in pregnancy.",

The F6214-1 (4nonb) strain of L. monocytogenes is more virulent than the 10403S (1/2a) strain following intra-gastric inoculation in both pregnant and non-pregnant mice (Hamrick et al., 2003). It is usually difficult to reproduce placental infection after oro-gastric L. monocytogenes infection because of the low numbers of bacteria that cross the intestinal barrier in an immunocompetent mouse. However, intravenous inoculation of L. monocytogenes (dose range of 103 to 5 \u00d7 105) in BALB/c mice at mid-gestation (days 12\u201314) produces consistent placental infection with rapid fetal loss (Abram et al., 2003). As early as 6 h post infection, bacteria were detected in the placenta, followed by \u223c2-log units increase per day (Le Monnier et al., 2006). On day 1 bacteria were mainly visualized along the central arterial canal adhering extraneously to the vascular wall or internalized within the invasive trophoblastic cells and were absent from the decidua basalis (Le Monnier et al., 2006). By day 2, the bacteria were visualized in both the proximal and distal central arterial canal and had spread to the decidua, spongiotrophoblast and trophoblastic giant cells. By day 3 bacteria pervaded all layers of the placenta including the labyrinth. The profound placental proliferation of L. monocytogenes occurs even in pre-immunized mice that are protected from infection in other organs (Abram et al., 2003). However, not all placentas are infected within the same uterus.",

In contrast, L. monocytogenes-ActA mutant is unable to infect murine fetuses suggesting an involvement of this gene in cell-to-cell spread of bacteria through trophoblast layers (Le Monnier et al., 2007). A key observation was that trophoblasts of infected mice augmented a profound Th1 cytokine response, which led to neutrophil recruitment and limited spread of bacteria to the fetal side (Guleria and Pollard, 2000). Augmentation of innate immunity using CpG oligonucleotide pre-treatment of mice also decreased placental L. monocytogenes infection (Ito et al., 2004). Similarly, human invasive extra villous trophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells have been shown to restrict intracellular spread of L. monocytogenes (Zeldovich et al., 2011).",

            "text": "We first observed that ST infection initiated intravenously in resistant strains of mice (129X1Sv/J and C57129F1) during pregnancy resulted in a rapid and fatal systemic infection, characterized by 1000-fold greater splenic bacterial burden relative to non-pregnant mice (Pejcic-Karapetrovic et al., 2007). Three sequential events appear to contribute to ST-induced feto-maternal pathology; profound bacterial growth in the placenta, induction of massive placental inflammation, and weak splenic innate immune response (Fig. 2). Firstly, following hematogenous infection with 103 bacteria, few (<50) reached the feto-placental tissue. Astoundingly, the placental bacterial burden increased to 105\u2013107 by 14\u201330 h indicative of a bacterial doubling time of <2 h. In contrast the doubling time of the bacteria in the systemic organs was >10 h. ST infection evoked profound placental production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, G-CSF, IFN\u03b3 and IL-18 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). The avirulent ST \u0394aroA strain did not evoke this inflammatory response despite placental proliferation. Furthermore, infection with the virulent wild-type strain led to massive GR-1 positive neutrophil infiltration throughout the labyrinth trophoblast (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). Infected placentas rapidly lost tissue integrity exhibiting substantially reduced decidua and highly necrotic labyrinth. Furthermore, wild-type ST bacteria were found dispersed throughout the necrotic labyrinth trophoblast within 48 h post-infection. In contrast, avirulent ST \u0394aroA bacteria were localized to the decidua, and did not evoke placental inflammation and fetal loss. We speculate that inflammation is triggered when virulent Salmonella infects the labyrinth trophoblast. Indeed, Salmonella utilize a specialized type III secretion system to invade non-phagocytic cells (Valdez et al., 2009). Furthermore, Salmonella secrete \u223c30 different effector proteins into infected cells via their type III secretion apparatus which aids intracellular survival. Therefore, Salmonella can rapidly and easily spread across placental layers, even in the absence of tissue infarction. Bacteria may gain access to maternal decidua either directly or via infection of macrophages or reach the labyrinth trophoblast by escaping the blood sinusoids.",

            "text": "Innate immunity to ST plays a critical role in controlling infection as adaptive immunity to this pathogen is substantially delayed (Luu et al., 2006). Thus, ST infection in non-pregnant mice is characterized by increase in numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and conspicuous increase in NK cells by 48 h, whereas this response is abrogated in pregnant-infected mice (Pejcic-Karapetrovic et al., 2007). Furthermore, the splenic NK cell cytotoxic function and serum IL-12 response was dampened in pregnant ST-infected hosts. However, the levels of certain inflammatory chemokines/cytokines such as IL-6, BLC (B lymphocyte chemoattractant)/CXCL13, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-1R antagonist (IL-Ra), I-309/CCL1, KC, CCL12 and MIP-2 were up regulated 5\u201330-fold in the serum of pregnant ST infected mice (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). Interestingly, serum IL-10 was also increased in pregnant-infected mice, suggesting a counter host response to overcome inflammation. Crucially, depletion of systemic IL-6 in vivo by antibody treatment significantly decreased splenic burden of virulent bacteria relative to untreated pregnant-infected mice (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). Thus, the mouse model suggests that Salmonella have evolved mechanisms for systemic dissemination in the pregnant host and cause a cytokine-storm mediated immunopathology. With the emergence of invasive NTS disease in immunocompromised hosts, susceptibility of pregnant women needs to be investigated carefully. A murine gut colonization model of Salmonella infection, after treatment of mice with streptomycin closely mimics gastroenteric fever (Santos et al., 2001) and may provide insight into the dissemination mechanism of NTS in immunocompromised humans.",

Thus, there has been interest generated in studying the immune response to infection in pregnant mice infected with bacteria that can induce periodontal infections. F. nucleatum is one such anaerobic pathogen implicated in periodontal infections and placental chorioamnionitis (Gauthier et al., 2011). Systemic infection initiated on day 14.5 of murine pregnancy resulted in only transient maternal systemic colonization (Han et al., 2004). Similar to Listeria and Salmonella, localization of a small numbers of bacteria to the uterine decidua resulted in overwhelming placental infection, with premature delivery and/or stillbirth. However, organisms were suggested to enter the labyrinth only after ischemic necrosis and tissue infarction due to decidual vascular thrombosis (Han et al., 2004). Interestingly, infection of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but not TLR2 knockout mice prevented necrosis and inflammation and reduced fetal loss but did not affect bacterial titers in the placenta (Liu et al., 2007), implicating inflammation rather than bacterial burden as a cause of adverse pregnancy outcome. In another model, infection of mice with C. rectus or P. gingivalis increased expression of TLR4 occurred in infected labyrinth trophoblasts (Arce et al., 2009) suggesting that infection-induced danger signal recognition may trigger focal necrosis, neutrophils infiltration of the labyrinth and fetal loss.",

Murine placental infection is characterized by basal zone necrosis, syncytiotrophoblast hyperplasia, mononuclear infiltration, sinusoid constriction and accumulation of infected erythrocytes (Hviid et al., 2010). Most importantly, binding of P. berghei infected erythrocytes to placental tissue was inhibited by soluble CSA, indicating a similar mechanism of sequestration of infected erythrocytes as in humans (Neres et al., 2008). P. berghei infection also contributes to placental inflammation marked by increase in chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1, CCL2, and consequent tissue damage. A model of recrudescent infection involves exposure to P. berghei prior to mating (Marinho et al., 2009). Infection then remains latent, and recurs during the second week of gestation, when parasitaemia suddenly rises, leading to infected erythrocyte sequestration in the placenta, inflammation-induced pathology and poor fetal outcome. This model mimics P. falciparum infection in pregnant women from endemic regions, including the influence of parity, as the clinical consequences were more pronounced in first pregnancy in pre-immune mice. This model revealed that multiparity decreased susceptibility to malaria due to increased IgG specific for the variant surface antigens expressed by the parasite during pregnancy (Megnekou et al., 2009).",

T. gondii GPI-anchors serve as effective ligands for TLR2 and TLR4 whereas HSP70 ligates TLR4 and stimulates macrophage maturation (Debierre-Grockiego et al., 2007, Mun et al., 1999). Furthermore, T. gondii profilin interacts with TLR11 in mice, and cyclophilin binds the CCR5 receptor (Aliberti et al., 2003, Menzies et al., 2008). Thus, the recognition of T. gondii danger signals stimulates a cascade of innate cellular and soluble responses; robust NK cell activation, dendritic cell maturation, macrophage activation and production of IFN\u03b3, IL-12, TNF\u03b1 and iNOS which together limit parasite tachyzoite replication (Coutinho et al., 2012, Miller et al., 2009). Indeed dendritic cell activation following T. gondii infection in mice is rapid; within a few hours most splenic CD11c+ cells have migrated from the red pulp to the T cell areas producing IL-12 (Miller et al., 2009). This in turn triggers a strong Th1 and CD8+ T cell response against the pathogen and sustained IFN\u03b3 production (Menzies et al., 2008). Importantly, the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection in mice reveals the critical balance of Th1 and Th2 response for control of parasitemia while minimizing overt inflammation. Thus, IL-10 diminishes the ability of macrophages to kill T. gondii, but mice deficient in IL-10 die following T. gondii infection due to cytokine shock (Gazzinelli et al., 1996).",

            "text": "As successful pregnancy is associated with a regulated innate and Th1/Th2 response at the feto-maternal interface, the immune response to T. gondii infection may favor abortion in pregnant mice. Alternatively, pregnancy induced down-modulation of the Th1 response may interfere with the mechanisms that effectively control parasite multiplication and promote congenital transmission (Fig. 2). Both these aspects have been examined in various strains of mice (Coutinho et al., 2012). C57BL/6 mice experience higher rates of resorptions than the BALB/c strain following T. gondii infection and this correlates to higher levels of decidual necrosis and systemic TNF-\u03b1 levels (Coutinho et al., 2012). However, T. gondii infection in pregnant mice results in minimal parasites in the uterus and decidua suggesting that pregnancy loss is directly attributable to the strong Th1 inflammatory response rather than high parasite burden at the feto-maternal interface (Coutinho et al., 2012). Conversely, pregnancy-induced modulation of Th1/Th2 response against T. gondii increases maternal susceptibility and congenital transmission of the parasite in murine models. For example, pregnant mice exhibit increased mortality following T. gondii infection relative to non-pregnant mice and this correlates to a decreased production of IFN\u03b3 (Luft and Remington, 1982). Hence, survival of T. gondii-infected pregnant mice can be increased by administration of IFN\u03b3 or IL-2 (Shirahata et al., 1992, Shirahata et al., 1993). Furthermore, anti-IFN\u03b3 treatment or depletion of CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3 increases maternal parasitemia and enhances congenital transmission in T. gondii-infected mice (Abou-Bacar et al., 2004, Shirahata et al., 1994). This correlates to increased T. gondii parasites seen it the uterus and placentas of mice deficient in IFN\u03b3 (Shiono et al., 2007). Similarly, depletion of NK cells increases the congenital transmission of T. gondii in RAG2 \u2212/\u2212 but not wild-type pregnant mice, suggesting a compensatory role of T and B cells as well (Combe et al., 2005). Maternal vaccination against T. gondii in mice has been successful in preventing congenital transmission to the fetus (Menzies et al., 2008). Thus, mouse models have revealed the critical balance of Th1 and Th2 immunity to T. gondii during pregnancy (Fig. 2).",

Systemic infection with mouse adapted influenza virus strains results in severe morbidity and maternal mortality in pregnant mice (Marcelin et al., 2011, Pazos et al., 2012b). A model that closely resembles human respiratory illness, is infection by the intranasal route with aerosolized lethal PR8 or non-lethal X31 influenza virus at gestational day 10.5 (Pazos et al., 2012b), leading to pronounced increase in pulmonary viral titers in pregnant mice. The fetuses also exhibited significant intrauterine growth retardation and were delivered pre-term. Interestingly, treatment of mice with estrogen pellets increased their susceptibility to influenza virus infection challenge (Pazos et al., 2012b). Type I interferons play a key role in immunity to viral infections. Pregnant mice infected with influenza virus exhibited substantially reduced IFN\u03b2 mRNA and interferon stimulating genes in the lung and also systemic organs not directly infected with the virus (Pazos et al., 2012b). Similarly, infected pregnant mice show reduced lung expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 on day 3 post-infection although number of innate immune cells (NK cells and DCs) were not reduced. In contrast, the splenic CD8+ T cell cytotoxic response to influenza infection was reduced in both pregnant and estrogen-treated animals relative to the non-pregnant state (Pazos et al., 2012b). In another study, aerosol inhalation of the pandemic A (H1N1) influenza strain by pregnant BALB/c mice evoked host fatality that correlated to increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the respiratory mucosa although viral titers in various organs were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant animals (Marcelin et al., 2011). Thus, immunity to influenza is compromised during pregnancy despite lack of placental infection (Fig. 2).",

The knowledge of placental defenses against infection is often derived from vitro models of human placental cultures. Murine models can complement vitro studies to elucidate the manner in which placental barrier is breached. The two potential sites of transmission of infection to the placenta are (1) the blood-syncytiotrophoblast in human and labyrinth trophoblast in mouse interface where the placenta is bathed in maternal blood and (2) the uterus\u2013trophoblast interface wherein the extra villous trophoblast in humans or giant trophoblast in mouse invade the uterine epithelium and come in contact with maternal immune cells. In vitro studies indicate that the human extra villous and syncytiotrophoblast cultures can be resistant to intracellular infections (Robbins and Bakardjiev, 2012). In vivo infection in mice can complementarily elucidate the sequence of key events during pathogenesis; primary site of infection, inflammation, tissue infarction and vertical transmission which may be variably modulated by pathogens.",

Indeed, in an elegant recent study, pregnant mice infected with murid herpes virus (MHV) demonstrated increased sensitivity to subsequent exposure to even low doses of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Cardenas et al., 2010). Similarly, a two-hit mechanism of exposure to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands synergistically triggered pre-mature labor in mice (Ilievski and Hirsch, 2010). Another emerging concept is the role of the gut microbiome and stress-induced disequilibrium of danger signals in triggering adverse pregnancy outcome (Friebe and Arck, 2008). The interaction of endogenous danger signals with exogenous infection can be easily addressed in pregnant mice.",

            "text": "A recent revelation is that immunotolerance mechanisms such as naturally occurring T regulatory cells in pregnancy create holes in host defense to pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella (Rowe et al., 2011). Many infections augment IL-6 production and IL-6 trans-signaling can convert the Treg cells to Th17 cells (Chaudhry et al., 2009). In humans, Th1/Th17-type immunity and decreased Treg cells are observed following implantation failure in assisted reproduction, unexplained infertility, recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), pre-eclampsia and pre-mature labor (Saito et al., 2010). These adverse pregnancy events may also have an infection etiology. Murine models may unravel the link between Tregs, Th17 and IL-6 in modulating response to infection during pregnancy.",

            "text": "Chronic maternal infections during pregnancy may affect the fetal immune system even without vertical transmission (Dauby et al., 2012). Deleterious effects such as modified neonatal immunity to vaccination and neurological disease in the offspring of infected mothers may occur (Elovitz et al., 2011). Alternatively, beneficial transmission of immune memory or reduction in allergy to the neonate may ensue (Stern et al., 2007). Experimental infection in murine pregnancy can provide a controlled setting to delineate the mechanism of such effects. Prophylaxis and treatment of infectious disease in endemic regions may also need differential approach during pregnancy for maximum effectiveness. Overall, only through the study of in vivo models can we unravel the complex bi-directional cross-talk between host immunity to infection and pregnancy.",

A schematic diagram showing the different ways in which infectious agents may interact with the feto-maternal interface cells and trophoblast. The left panel shows that parasites such as T. gondii are controlled by a strong Th1 and cytotoxic CD8 T cell response. The Th1 cytokines in an infected host may inflict damage to the trophoblast leading to fetal loss. The trophoblast inturn produces IL-10 and anti-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the Th1 response against the parasite. Macrophages and dendritic cells infected with the parasite may reach the feto-maternal interface leading to trophoblast infection and congenital transmission. Prior antibody immunity in chronically infected mothers can prevent congenital transmission. The middle panel shows that viruses such as influenza require a strong type I interferon response for clearance. However, this response may be dampened in the pregnant host due to enhanced T regulatory cell numbers and Th2 cytokine bias. High viral titers in peripheral tissue and severe maternal illness can occur despite lack of placental infection. The right panel shows that facultative intracellular bacteria such as Salmonella can reach the feto-maternal interface by escaping the maternal blood or may be carried by infected macrophages and dendritic cells. Once in the feto-placental milieu they efficiently infect trophoblast cells and profound pathogen proliferation ensues. This evokes massive inflammation and loss of placental tissue integrity. The inflammatory cytokines evoked by placental infection may convert resident T regulatory cells into Th17 cells, culminating in fetal loss and severe maternal illness.",
