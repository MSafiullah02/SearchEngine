The radiographic imaging during the early stages of infection shows multiple small, patchy shadows and interstitial changes in the peripheral lung field.19 As pneumonia progresses there are bilateral and multiple ground-glass images and infiltrates with pulmonary consolidation. These changes are accompanied by a normal or decreased peripheral white blood count with a reduction in lymphocytes. Current test kits use reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal and oral swab. A lower respiratory tract sample such as expectorated sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage can be used in intubated patients.19 Testing is recommended in all patients with signs or symptoms of infection. Geographic areas with high infection rates such as South Korea offer testing to all residents, and others test those who report contact with a known infected person. Postinfection testing is done routinely in some countries as asymptomatic individuals who recovered from a known infection can still carry and transmit the virus. All healthcare workers should be familiar with the recommendations for RT-PCR testing in their geographic region.",

Video-laryngoscope with a disposable blade works well with a transparent plastic cover to protect the screen and handle. Clearly designated disposal sites for airway equipment that is contaminated can help reduce exposure. Placing a wet gauze on the patient's mouth and nose during positive pressure ventilation reduces droplet dispersion. A full dose of muscle relaxant should be injected at 1 time and tracheal intubation performed only when muscle relaxants are fully active to prevent coughing. Healthcare providers may want to consider the risks and benefits of giving opioid analgesics prior to induction of general anesthesia because they can lead to significant coughing.21 Heat and moisture exchanging filters are recommended on both the inspiration port and the aspiration port of the respiratory circuit and should be replaced every 3 to 4 hours. There is evidence that filters can effectively reduce contamination of the anesthesia machine with pathogens including bacteria or viruses. However, use of filters has also been associated with increased airway pressures and auto-positive end-expiratory pressure, which can increase the risk of pulmonary barotrauma.22 Care must be given to the placement of the scavenging outlet because low flow circuits with filters may not eliminate all pathogens. Medical staff should change gloves after touching the patient's secretion, making sure not to contaminate items in the operating room.",

In teaching centers, intubation of patients out of the operating room by more experienced staff may reduce the risk of transmission under emergency conditions. Designation of a well-coordinated emergency airway team can reduce potential transmission by working together as a coordinated unit to assemble materials, assist with intubation, and dispose of contaminated materials. Portable airway kits should be left in the buffer zone during intubation and subsequently thoroughly disinfected or disposed of.",
