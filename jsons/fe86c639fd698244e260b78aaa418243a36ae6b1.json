Although CNS infection has been suspected to contribute to the development of GME and NME, 1,3-6 routine diagnostic techniques such as culture and microscopy have failed to identify protozoal, fungal, or bacterial pathogens. 8 However, a comprehensive search for viral and atypical bacterial pathogens by sensitive molecular techniques 9,10 has been lacking. Adeno-, 11 bunya-, 11 corona-, 12 entero-, 11, 13 flavi-, 11, 14 herpes-, 9, 11, 15, 16 paramyxo-, 11, 17 and parecho-18 viruses all have been documented as causes of meningoencephalomyelitis in people. Moreover, Mycoplasma edwardii recently was reported as a cause of meningoencephalitis in a dog. 19 The investigators evaluated the hypothesis that broadly reactive PCR may aid in finding occult viral and Mycoplasma infections associated with GME and NME. Brain tissue was prospectively collected from cases of histopathologically confirmed GME and NME to evaluate for the presence of known and novel pathogens by broadly reactive PCR for adeno-, bunya-, corona-, entero-, flavi-, herpes-, paramyxo-, and parecho-viruses. In addition, Mycoplasma genus-specific PCR was retrospectively performed on collected brain tissue.",

Here, we evaluated fresh-frozen tissue from histopathologically confirmed GME and NME cases for a diverse collection of viruses using broadly reactive PCR to identify unknown as well as known pathogens. 23, 25, 26 While the comprehensive nature of this investigation supports that viruses are not commonly associated with GME and NME, several limitations must be considered, including the small sample size, method and timing of sample collection, lack of standardized virus-infected tissue for PCR control, and use of some noncanine viruses as PCR controls. In all cases, tissues were collected from the frontal lobe, which may or may not have resulted in direct sampling of inflammatory lesions. In addition, the PCR assays utilized ranged in sensitivity from 30 to 500 copies of target gene per reaction, which may have precluded identification of low viral loads. Importantly, however, the PCR assays utilized here have demonstrated utility in identifying viruses associated with canine CNS disease. 31 To fully utilize the GME and NME tissues collected for this investigation, Mycoplasma genus-specific PCR was performed in addition to viral screening. Interestingly, several Mycoplasma species regularly associated with the respiratory tract of dogs were identified, and detection of M. canis by PCR was significantly associated with a diagnosis of GME and NME. Although M. canis has been associated with respiratory and urogenital diseases, 32 this is the 1st report of M. canis associated with CNS disease or nervous tissue in any species. The importance of finding M. canis associated with GME and NME is unclear. M. canis was not detected in situ and was detected in 2 controls, so contamination because of nonaseptic tissue collection cannot be ruled out. However, if contamination was the sole explanation for this finding, M. canis would be expected to occur at an equal frequency in GME and NME cases and controls. In addition, the polyclonal sera used for IHC were diluted significantly to avoid background, which may have contributed to the negative results obtained from this assay. Alternatively, M. canis may be associated with primary disease pathogenesis or may have been present secondary to previously existing disease or patient immunosuppression. Interestingly, Mycoplasma pneumonia has been implicated as a common yet elusive etiology in acute childhood encephalitis, 33 a disease with similar clinical and neuropathological features to that of GME and NME that also has a favorable clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy. Also, 5/11 GME and 6/27 NME cases received antibiotics before tissue collection, which may have altered the ability to detect or recover mycoplasmas in these cases. Of note, 2 Mycoplasma species were identified in several cases, which could support contamination with ubiquitous organisms or represent coinfection similar to Mycoplasma synoviae and Mycoplasma meleagridis in turkeys. 34 It also is noteworthy that CNS mycoplasmosis involving other species can result in suppurative inflammation, 19, 35 which is not a typical feature of GME and NME pathology. However, without a better understanding of the pathological processes that drive GME and NME, a role for M. canis cannot be excluded.",

Interestingly, neuraminidase activity recently was identified in M. canis. 42 Neuraminidase is a virulence factor possessed by a wide variety of bacterial species that has been shown to promote pathogen colonization, invasion and damage of host tissue 43 and recently was identified as critical for bacterial entry into the CNS in Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. 44 Genetic susceptibility to M. canis infection also must be considered. 1,2,7 A missense mutation predisposing people to infection-triggered acute necrotizing encephalopathy recently was described 45 and breed-based susceptibility to certain pathogens also is likely in dogs. 46 It is possible that genetic immunosusceptibility to M. canis infection may contribute to a multifactorial etiopathogenesis in dogs that develop GME and NME.
