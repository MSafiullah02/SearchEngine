A screening encompassing RT-PCR detection of SARS-Cov-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT-scan should ideally be done less than 24 hours before surgery. If this screening is impossible, the patient must be regarded as COVID positive and the appropriate precaution measures must be observed, in line with the protocol established in each center. Group B: Cancers for whom postponing the treatment beyond one month could have a negative prognostic impact for the patient. Examples of such tumors are squamous cell cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, aggressive cancers of the salivary glands, aggressive skin cancers. If tracheostomy is not required, patient's management should not be delayed. All necessary investigations and treatments (scans, dental treatment before RT, PAC, etc.) should be performed during a single hospital stay in order to minimize patient's comings and goings between home and hospital.
