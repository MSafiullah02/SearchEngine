PTE was diagnosed at postmortem examination in 17 cats, a prevalence of 0.06% over a 24-year period. The age of affected cats ranged from 10 months to 18 years, although young (\u03fd4 years) and old (\u03fe10 years) cats were more commonly affected than were middleaged cats. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of cats with PTE (n \u03ed 16) had concurrent disease, which was often severe. The most common diseases identified in association with PTE were neoplasia, anemia of unidentified cause, and pancreatitis. Cats with glomerulonephritis, encephalitis, pneumonia, heart disease, and hepatic lipidosis were also represented in this study. Most cats with PTE demonstrated dyspnea and respiratory distress before death or euthanasia, but PTE was not recognized ante mortem in any cat studied. In conclusion, PTE can affect cats of any age and is associated with a variety of systemic and inflammatory disorders. It is recommended that the same clinical criteria used to increase the suspicion of PTE in dogs should also be applied to cats.",

Thus, the prevalence of PTE in cats over this time period was very low (0.06%). This study was designed to exclude cats with a clinical diagnosis of PTE that was not confirmed by postmortem examination because of the difficulties associated with making an accurate antemortem diagnosis of PTE. 11 The actual prevalence of PTE in this population of cats was likely higher because some cats with small emboli might have survived and some cats that died of PTE might not have had postmortem examinations performed. On the other hand, any estimate that includes cats with only a clinical diagnosis of PTE (not confirmed with postmortem examination) is likely to overestimate the prevalence of PTE.

Most cats affected with PTE were the domestic shorthair breed, which likely reflects the overall distribution of the hospital population. The small number of purebred cats represented in this study is similar to that reported by Norris et al 8 and does not allow accurate assessment of breed susceptibility. Both sexes were equally affected in this study. The median body weight of cats with PTE in this study was 3.8 kg, similar to the body weight reported for another series of cats with PTE. 8 The low body weights of cats with PTE likely reflected the effects of concurrent illness rather than an effect of PTE. Although body-condition scores were not evaluated for the study cats, the low mean body weight likely indicates that most of these cats had less-than-optimal body-condition scores. A low body-condition score may be independently associated with an increased risk of death in emaciated cats, although age and other factors likely also play a role. 12 However, the available data do not permit us to conclude that low body weight is a risk factor for PTE. The ages of 15 of the 17 affected cats at the time of death ranged from \u03fd1 year to \u03fe18 years of age, which is similar to a previous report. 8 However, the age distribution was bimodal, with peak occurrence at less than 4 years of age or greater than 10 years of age. It is unclear why PTE occurred more frequently in younger and older cats than in middle-aged cats. One possible explanation is that disorders that place the patient at risk to develop PTE occur more often in these 2 age groups. This is true for disorders such as FIP or neoplasia, which occur more frequently in younger 13 and older cats, respectively. However, PTE also occurred in cats with pancreatitis and lymphoid neoplasms, which are disorders that affect cats of any age, suggesting that other factors might underlie the observed age distribution of affected cats.",

Among the disorders that have been linked to PTE in dogs are heartworm disease, 4 hemolytic anemia, 3 hyperadrenocorticism, 5 pancreatitis, neoplasia, and sepsis. 6 Dogs affected with a disorder known to be associated with PTE or with any factor or combination of factors that underlie the pathogenesis of PTE should be closely observed for signs of PTE. The results of this study and the results of others 8 indicate that most cats with PTE are also affected with severe concurrent clinical disease. Only 1 cat in the present study did not have an identifiable, concurrent medical problem. This cat had been affected with cerebellar hypoplasia since birth. In our view, cerebellar hypoplasia is unlikely to be related to PTE, so we considered this cat to be healthy for purposes of data analysis. We found that PTE complicated the clinical course of commonly diagnosed diseases of cats, such as neoplasia, pancreatitis, anemia, and cardiac disease, as in a previous study. 8 PTE also occurred in cats affected with glomerulonephritis and pneumonia, which have also been associated with PTE in dogs 5,14,15 and cats. 8 Overall, cats in the present study were affected with diseases similar to those reported in association with PTE in dogs 2,5 and humans. 1 Only 1 study cat with confirmed PTE had heart disease, which was surprising because previous studies have reported PTE as a complication of heart disease in the cat. 8, 16 To further investigate this unusual finding, we reviewed the records of cats with heart disease that had been identified by the initial computer search but were excluded from the study group. Most identified cats with heart disease had received a clinical diagnosis of PTE that was not confirmed by postmortem examination. Another possible reason so few cats with heart disease were included in our study was that these cats died outside the hospital and were unavailable for postmortem examination.",

Ten cats with PTE were noted to have abnormal respiratory findings before death or euthanasia. The remainder of the cats either did not have an annotation in the medical record that specifically noted respiratory findings or were recorded as normal and nondistressed. Respiratory difficulty was generally ascribed by the attending clinicians to progression of an existing condition (eg, cats with known respiratory abnormalities) or to a metabolic complication of severe disease (eg, cats with pancreatitis). Interestingly, in no case studied was PTE suspected, even though the patient might have had multiple risk factors for PTE (as extrapolated from dogs and humans). Thus, we conclude that the clinical recognition of PTE in cats in this study was low.",

The findings of pleural effusion, alveolar opacification, peribronchial and interstitial markings, or pulmonary vascular congestion were similar to those previously reported for dogs and cats with PTE. 2, 8, 17 In this study, radiographic abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature were not reported in any case. It is difficult to evaluate these findings in the setting of PTE diagnosis because most of the study cats for which radiographic studies were available were those that had known thoracic disease, and the radiographs largely reflected the existing disease process. Various radiographic abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature, including lobar oligemia, uneven or asymmetrical vascular diameter, and evidence of vessel truncation, were apparent in the majority of cats reviewed in 1 study. 8 The lack of similar radiographic findings in this study might be explained by differences in study design. In contrast with the study by Norris et al, 8 who re-evaluated the radiographic studies for each of the cats studied, we reviewed the original radiographic interpretations as reported in the medical record. Overall, the small number of radiographic studies evaluated in this study makes it difficult to form any conclusions about the usefulness of radiography in the diagnosis of PTE in cats. However, it is likely that plain radiography will have a low sensitivity and specificity for PTE in cats, as it does in dogs. 17 ",
