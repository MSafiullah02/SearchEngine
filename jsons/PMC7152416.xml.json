            "text": "In general, RSNO have red, pink or green color due to strong absorption of visible light. As an example, Fig. 2\nshows the UV\u2013VIS spectrum of pink GSNO with two prominent absorption bands from the S\u2013NO bond. The UV peak at 336 nM (\u03b5\n336 = 778 (Mcm)\u22121) is attributed to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition, and the secondary band at 545 nM (\u03b5\n545 = 34 (Mcm)\u22121) to a n\nN \u2192 \u03c0* transition [12,13]. The intensity of these absorption bands is quite sensitive to the type of thiol. In albumin, S-nitrosation of the Cys34 residue leads to a slightly higher extinction of \u03b5\n335 = 870 (Mcm)\u22121 [14]. Multiple S-nitrosation of different residues leads to correspondingly higher extinctions. Multiple nitrosated albumin (poly-SNO-albumin) can reach a molar extinction of \u03b5\n335 = 3870 (Mcm)\u22121[15]. In the infrared region, the RSNO moiety has additional characteristic absorptions from the N\u2013O stretch vibration (1480\u20131530 cm\u22121) and the C\u2013S stretch vibration (600\u2013730 cm\u22121).",

A modest release of RSNO from catalytic action of ceruloplasmin and NOS itself has been reported [26], but potent enzymatic pathways for S-nitrosation seem not to have been identified so far [2]. It suggests that non-enzymatic pathways dominate in vivo. The transformation of RSH to RSNO requires the appearance of S-nitrosating intermediates like nitrosonium NO+, NO2 or N2O3. The reaction pathways for the formation of these species from free NO were discussed in Chapter 1. Although the reactions are well studied in vitro, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the dominant mechanism for S-nitrosation of sulfhydryls in vivo [22,27]. Via what pathway do S-nitrosocompounds appear in live tissue?

However, such trace metal ions are known to accelerate both formation and decomposition of S-nitrosothiols in vitro [30] and in vivo, possibly by catalyzing the formation of nitrosating species like NO+, NO2 or N2O3 from NO in the presence of oxygen. This makes it unlikely that a mechanism like Eq. (4) be the dominant pathway for formations of S-nitrosothiols in vivo. Certain enzymes like ceruloplasmin and NOS itself were seen to catalyze the formation of S-nitrosothiols [26] but yields remain low. Alternatively, dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) are known to participate in a complex reaction equilibrium between thiols, NO and S-nitrosothiols. This equilibrium is discussed in detail in Chapter 11 of this book. In-vitro experiments have confirmed that the presence of iron induce formation of RSNO from NO via intermediate DNIC even in anoxic conditions [31]. Intriguingly, the formation of small quantities of DNIC from endogenous iron has been detected in many biological systems after exposure to exogenous NO or after stimulus of endogenous NO production. Many examples were reported from cell cultures to plant and animal tissues. However, decisive proof of the physiological relevance of this DNIC pathway is still lacking.",

Alternatively, the NO may be detected electrochemically with an NO electrode, or by spin-trapping with electron paramagnetic resonance (cf Chapter 18). Selectivity for high or low molecular mass may be obtained via filtering with ultrafiltration membranes [4] or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Photolysis-chemiluminescence spectroscopy [33] is a sensitive method to analyze mixtures of S-nitrosothiols. It consists of an instrumental cascade comprising a HPLC pump, photolysis chamber and a chemiluminescence spectrometer or ozone analyzer.

The coexistence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments in cells, tissues and even individual proteins may modify the reactions as known in water. The main reason is the tendency of neutral species like NO, O2 and N2O3 to accumulate in hydrophobic compartments like the membrane fraction [26,36] or hydrophobic pockets of proteins. This effect could promote the S-nitrosation of the \u03b293 cysteine of hemoglobin which is located in a hydrophobic region of the protein [32]. In addition, it has been recognized that the presence of nearby amino acids affects the rate of S-nitrosylation by modifying the polarity and effective acidity in proximity of the cysteine residue [2]. It has been shown that the presence of a lipid compartment accelerates the oxidation of NO by O2 by orders of magnitude [36].",

Although the various RSNO share the common C\u2013S\u2013N=O motif, they show a big variation in intrinsic stability when in solution. The reason for this variation is not well understood. Given this instability, aqueous solutions of RSNO tend to release a certain quantity of gaseous NO and accumulate typical decomposition products like thiols, disulfides and reaction products of thiyl radicals. It was recently discovered that, in presence of oxygen, a certain quantity of disulfide S-oxides (GS(O)SG) and disulfide S-dioxides (GS(O2)SG) [37,38] is formed as well. These metabolites of GSH are effective agents for S-glutathiolation of sulfhydryl groups. They can inactivate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and alcohol dehydrogenases, and release zinc from metallothionin and zinc finger proteins. Such mixtures of decomposition products result from a combination of pathways operating simultaneously. In practical applications usually more than just a single pathway contributes significantly.

Transnitrosation rates for cysteine and glutathione were reported [14] at around 80 (Ms)\u22121 (37\u00b0C, pH 7.4). Lower rates of 3\u20139 (Ms)\u22121 apply for transnitrosation from S-nitrosoalbumin to cysteine and glutathione. The transfer rates increase significantly when pH is raised and a larger fraction of thiols is deprotonated. It was shown that 50 \u03bcM CysNO and S-nitrosoalbumin establish their equilibrium by transnitrosation on a timescale of several minutes in vitro (cf Fig. 6\n) [48]. Transnitrosation from GSNO is slower due to a combination of smaller transfer rate and orders of magnitude lower concentration of GSNO (Table 1). Therefore, the characteristic timescale for equilibration with GSNO should be many minutes. In human plasma, albumin was confirmed to be the dominant target for transnitrosation from CysNO and GSNO [49], with metal chelators having only insignificant effect on the extent and rate of S-nitrosation of the albumin target. In whole blood, the reaction balance is shifted considerably because Hb may be S-nitrosated or nitrosylated at the heme.

This effect has been shown in vivo: Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a protein in cellular membranes that normally catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange. The activity of the PDI protein was found to enhance the intracellular pool of S-nitrosothiols in cultured human erythroleukemia cells [50].

This reaction pathway amounts to S-glutathiolation of the sulfhydryl moiety. Several proteins underwent a combination of S-nitrosation and S-glutathiolation when exposed to GSNO. In contrast, bovine serum albumin, actin and alcohol dehydrogenase were only S-nitrosated by fresh GSNO. S-glutathiolation of intracellular proteins has been demonstrated in vivo: upon incubation with exogenous CysNO, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts underwent combined S-nitrosation and S-glutathiolation of the cysteine residues of H-ras protein [54].

The effect may be inhibited by the thiol-blocking compound N-ethylmaleimide [58]. Two different mechanisms have been identified for this phenomenon: transnitrosation and formation of disulfides. In the first case, the GSNO is depleted by the transnitrosation to the shorter lived CysNO. In the same spirit, transnitrosation to more stable species may stabilize the pool of S-nitrosothiols up to a certain degree. The second mechanism is mediated by the reductive nature of the thiol anions and involves the formation of a disulfide bridge under release of a nitroxyl anion [24,59]:(8)RSNO+GS\u2212 \u2192RS\u2212SG+NO\u2212\n",

Given that tissues contain GSH below mM concentrations (Table 1), this decay channel of GSNO appears insignificant in vivo. If on the other hand RS represents a sulfhydryl group on a protein, the reaction (8) amounts to S-glutathiolation of the protein. It has been confirmed that the coincubation with a mixture of GSNO and glutathione causes S-glutathiolation of the sulhydryl groups on a wide range of different proteins. [53,60]. More detailed studies [37] have shown that intermediate oxides like GS(O)SG or GS(O2)SG are better S-glutathiolating agents than GSNO itself (see below). Therefore, the process of S-glutathiolation may in fact be more complex than suggested by Eq. (8). S-glutathiolation maybe reversed by dithiothreitol [60].",

GSNOR activity is found in many different tissues and found highest in liver [71]. The physiological significance of the GSNOR pathway was impressively demonstrated by experiments with GSNOR knockout mutant mice [4], which showed greatly enhanced levels of RSNO and became hypotensive under anesthesia. Human asthmatics show the combination of enhanced GSNOR levels and depressed GSNO in the bronchial fluids. It suggests that chemically incorporated NO stores are depleted in asthmatic patients. Since the remainder of NO is exhaled, the unbalance between NO and S-nitrosocompounds may be the reason for the observed increase of exhaled NO in asthma [70,72]. Recent studies on the decomposition of low-molecular-weight S-nitrosothiols in tissue homogenates of rats have provided more evidence that enzymatic pathways contribute significantly to the process [73]. The above publications leave no doubt that significant enzymatic pathways for S-denitrosation of LMW nitrosothiols operate in mammals. Their role in the regulation of endogenous pool of S-nitrosothiols remains the subject of intense research for the moment being.",

Therefore, one might expect a significant oxidation of S-nitrosothiols by oxyHb as well. However, in-vitro experiments show that the NO moiety of S-nitrosothiols is well protected against oxidation to nitrate by oxy-heme. Exposure of a small quantity of CysNO to oxyHb leads to S-nitrosation of the Cys\u03b293 residue of the protein but not to the formation of nitrate [77,78]. In fact, the rates and extent of transnitrosation from CysNO were very similar for oxyHb and metHb. This transnitrosation reaction to oxyHb was completely inhibited by the addition of the metal chelators neocuproine and DTPA [78]. Therefore, the transnitrosation of oxyHb seems to require the presence of catalytic traces of copper, either in free form or in the form of Cu\u2013Zn dismutase.",

Phrased otherwise, a small quantity of low-molecular-weight S-nitrosothiols can survive for a very long time in the presence of oxy-heme. This property is a very significant distinction with free NO. It explains why significant quantities of S-nitrosothiols can coexist with oxygenated erythrocytes and blood (Table 1), in clear contrast to free NO. Oxidation to nitrate becomes feasible only if GSNO is supplied in excess over Cys\u03b293 residues [78]. This situation is very unlikely to happen in vivo.Under anaerobic conditions, GSNO can be reduced by deoxyhemoglobin in a slow and irreversible reaction [79]. In presence of excess deoxyHb, the half life of GSNO is about an hour with concomitant release of equimolar quantities of GSH and nitrosylated ferric hemoglobin. The reaction rate was dependent on the conformer state (R or T) of the Hb tetramer. Interestingly, transnitrosation from GSNO to the Cys\u03b293 residue of Hb did not occur in this assay. As with oxyHb, the reaction pathway with deoxyHb seems not relevant for the lifetime of GSNO in vivo.",

The transport of S-nitrosothiols across cell membranes was particularly controversial [50,80,81]. Experimental evidence suggests that molecules like GSNO or GSH cannot cross cellular membranes, neither by passive diffusion nor by an active transport mechanism. The carboxyl groups of glutathione are only weakly acid, so that GSNO and GSH should be a dynamic mixture of neutral, anionic and dianionic forms. But even the neutrals are not capable of crossing into the intracellular compartment. Studies [82] on NIH/3T3 fibroblasts showed that exposure to extracellular GSNO or SNAP failed to increase intracellular S-nitrosation. Low levels of extracellular CysNO (<0.1 mM) enhanced intracellular cysteine levels but failed to raise S-nitrosation. Significant S-nitrosation was only observed at high levels (1 mM) of extracellular CysNO. S-nitrosation of the intracellular compartment took place on a timescale of about 10 min [82]. NMR studies [83] confirmed that no significant exchange of GSH takes place over the membrane of human erythrocytes. Moreover, the extracellular glutathione affected neither the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio nor the glucose metabolism of the erythrocytes. This indicates that extracellular GSH did not provoke intracellular release of thiols from cleavage of disulfide bonds in the interior compartment. Taken together, this study showed that intracellular GSH cannot be raised by suppletion of extracellular GSH. The cellular transport of small S-nitrosothiols was extensively studied by Hogg et al. [84,85]. They showed that extracellular GSNO and SNAP did not significantly increase the pool of intracellular S-nitrosothiols in RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, the coincubation of GSNO with l-cysteine or its disulfide (l-cystine) greatly enhanced the intracellular S-nitrosation. The S-nitroso moieties were predominantly located on the cysteine residues of proteins. Significant intracellular S-nitrosation was also observed after incubation with only extracellular l-CysNO. The data suggested that l-CysNO was transported intact across the membrane, and initiated subsequent transnitrosation towards the intracellular proteins. The effect of l-cysteine on extracellular GSNO was plausibly explained by the following sequence of events: First, transnitrosation from GSNO to l-CysNO. Second, active transport of l-CysNO across the membrane into the interior compartment. Third, transnitrosation from l-CysNO to the sulfhydryl groups of the proteins. The transport of l-CysNO was stereospecific for the l-isomer and could be blocked by inhibitors of the cellular transport system of amino acids. The uptake of l-CysNO was specifically attributed to the amino acid transporter system L (l-AT) [81,85].",

            "text": "The first category contains the majority of effects mediated by the guanylate cyclasedependent pathway in tissues and cellular assays [86,87]. The RSNO can be of low molecular weight like GSNO or high molecular weight like S-nitrosohemoglobin. It is now widely accepted that the release of free NO from cleavage of the S\u2013NO bond in cells and tissues is dominated by catalytic action of copper [88]. Recent studies [86] report that GSNO and S-nitrosated oxy-hemoglobin is vasodilating without release of free NO (cf Fig. 7\n). The sensitivity of aortic tissue to GSNO is very high, and of the same order of magnitude as the sensitivity to the physiological stimulant acetyl choline (Ach) (Fig. 8\n). The vasodilation of aortic rings is considerably reduced when superoxide levels in the organ bath are artificially raised by coincubation with pyrogallol [89], a generator of superoxide radicals. Seen as NO donors various RSNOs can produce both beneficial and adverse effects on cells and tissues. This state of affairs reminds us of the ongoing controversy surrounding the benefits/disadvantages of upregulation of NOS enzymes. Many detailed studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that raising levels of free NO be beneficial in vascular ischemia, but harmful in brain ischemia. Accordingly, many therapeutic treatments of ischemia involve NO donors for vasculature, and NOS inhibitors for brain. Experiments confirm many similarities between the effect on ischemia of LMW S-nitrosothiols and true NO donors. The similarities include relaxation of blood vessels or bronchial smooth muscle, inhibition platelet aggregation, etc. Just as with true NO donors, high doses of RSNO can be harmful and activate the apoptotic chain [90, 91, 92]. The mechanism is still being investigated. A significant contribution is attributed to the oxidation of excess NO to the highly noxious peroxinitrite. The latter induces so-called nitrosative stress [93].",

NO is implicated in the activation of the apoptotic chain. Details of this mechanism are discussed in Chapter 12. Interestingly, the apoptotic action of NO depends on the presence of iron. Cellular apoptosis could also be abrogated in a range of cultured human tumor cell lines by the addition of exogenous iron to the medium [91]. RAW264.7 macrophages contain a comparatively low amount of non-heme iron. These macrophages proved quite susceptible to the pro-apoptotic action of RSNOs. Preincubation with exogenous iron reinforced their resistance to apoptosis and EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of intracellular DNIC with thiol-containing ligands [90]. These DNIC were evidently assembled from RSNO and non-heme iron. In contrast, hepatocytes contain fairly large amounts of endogenous iron and show much higher resistance to the proapoptotic effect of NO [90]. The cellular reaction pathways for DNIC are considered in detail in Chapter 11. Intracellular formation of DNIC was also observed after addition of ferrous iron to cultured leukemic cells incubated with S-nitrosocysteine (Vanin, A.F., nonpublished data). The incubation of cells with Cys-DNIC or GS-DNIC did not affect the cell viability.",

As donors, they are clearly distinguished by their response to alterations in the pool of free iron and copper in the solutions. Addition of a metal chelator like bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS) will remove the iron from DNIC and induce instantaneous release of the nitrosyl ligands into the solution. The effect on GSNO is exactly opposite in that its lifetime is greatly extended by chelation of the free metal ions. But the pools of RSNO and DNIC are always coupled in a dynamic equilibrium by the presence of free iron ([96] and Chapter 11). It should be noted that tissues always contain a certain quantity of loosely bound iron (experimental evidence for this iron pool in tissues is reviewed in Chapter 2).",

            "text": "Effects of S-nitrosation on enzymatic activity have now been confirmed for dozens of enzymes in vitro as well as in vivo. The involvement of S-nitrosation is usually established beyond doubt by being reversible under treatment with the denitrosating agent dithiothreitol. S-nitrosation can inhibit glutathione reductase [99], seven members of the caspase family [100], including the inducer of apoptosis, caspase 3 [100,101], creatine kinase [102], glutathione-S-transferase [103], adenosyltransferase [104], transcription factor Yin Yang [105], catepsin K [106], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [107], alcohol dehydrogenase [108], c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 [109], HIF-1\u03b1 protein [110], protein tyrosine phosphatase [111], inactivate aconitase [112], activate the ryanodine receptor for calcium release [113], inhibit adenyl cyclase enzyme in rat thymocytes [81,114], etc. Also S-nitrosation of crucial thiol groups by exogenous or endogenous low-molecular RSNOs can inhibit the ligand-binding ability of glucocorticoid receptor [115], disrupt the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain [116], induce cytostasis or cytotoxicity [117], inhibit nf-\n\u03ba\nB binding to DNA [118,119], inhibit papain [111] and ornithine decarboxilase [120], inhibit Complex I from the mitochondrial respiratory chain [121], regulate the redox state and anti-apoptotic function of thioredoxin [122]. This list is exemplary only and by no means exhaustive. As a rule, these inhibitions are reversible, and enzymatic activity may be restored by S-denitrosation, for example by adding excess glutathione or dithiothreitol. It should also be noted that enzymes may interact with nitrosospecies in more than just one way. A well-known example is Hb which undergoes nitrosylation of the heme and also S-nitrosation of its Cys\u03b293 residue. Another is Complex I of the respirational chain which undergoes nitrosylation of the catalytic Cu-B/heme-a3 site as well as multiple S-nitrosation of cysteine residues [94].",

            "text": "Before concluding the effects in the second category, we recall that DNIC plays a very important role in the process of protein S-nitrosation by LMW RSNOs. As was mentioned earlier, the probability of transnitrosation from low-molecular RSNOs to protein thiol groups is low and takes many minutes to establish equilibrium (Fig. 6). Spurious iron and copper help significantly, but the formation of DNIC really accelerates transnitrosation. It was shown by Boese et al. [123] that Cys-DNIC is much more effective for S-nitrosation of serum albumin than CysNO itself. It is conceivable that loosely bound iron and DNIC rather than spurious copper determine the rate and extent of S-nitrosation of the proteins in cultured cells and tissues.",

            "text": "Here we list a number of physiological responses via mechanisms other than S-nitrosation. More precisely, processes for which S-nitrosation does not play a role or in which S-nitrosation has not been recognized yet. S-nitrosothiols provide neuroprotection [124], protect against amyloid \u03b2-peptide neurotoxicity [125], induce bacteriostatic effect of \u03b11-protease inhibitor [126], interrupt the replication of the coronavirus [127], inactivate HIV-1 protease [128], inhibit dystrophin proteolysis by Coxsackieviral protease 2A [129], promote expression of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in several human bronchial cells types [130] and stimulate noradrenalin release in rat brain [81]. Nitrosprusside and SNAP activate a complex extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway via an as yet unknown mechanism [131]. S-nitrosothiols are often found to influence the life cycle of viruses, for example human immunodeficiency [132], Herpes Simplex [2] and Epstein-Barr [133]. In many cases the mechanism has not been fully understood, and it is speculated that S-nitrosation of thiols might have significant effect on virion maturation [2,127]. Upon incubation with S-nitrosothiols, the cysteine residues of proteins often show a certain degree of S-glutathiolation. The S-glutathiolation pathway is often operating simultaneously with S-nitrosation. The process of S-glutathiolation requires the presence of oxygen and seems to be dominated by intermediate oxides like GS(O)SG or GS(O2)SG [37]. S-glutathiolation of intracellular proteins has been demonstrated in vivo: upon incubation with exogenous CysNO, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts underwent combined S-nitrosation and S-glutathiolation of the cysteine residues of H-ras protein [54]. S-glutathiolation may be reversed by dithiothreitol which is an effective reductor for disulfide bonds [60]. Again, the above list is not exhaustive.",

These alternative NO donors are described in detail in Chapter 17 of this book. The risk of excessive hypotension makes that clinical studies of the effect of GSNO in humans are very few.

As mentioned before, this state of affairs is primarily caused by the practical problems regarding the need to keep complete control over the dosage to avoid life threatening loss of systemic blood pressure. S-nitrosothiols, whether they be of low or high molecular weight, clearly elicit strong physiological responses. Some of these responses are acute (e.g. vasodilation) and some induced on a longer timescale (like apoptosis). But strong that they are and since the S-nitrosothiols are endogenously formed, these compounds deserve constant attention and consideration by researchers in the field of NO.",
