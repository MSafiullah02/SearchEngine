            "text": "Viruses are the smallest infectious agents that can cause many diseases such as influenza, chicken pox, flu, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola and etc. Viruses are intracellular parasites unlike other microorganisms. These agents have only a few number of responsible genes for the synthesis of new viruses and most of them used different enzymes which created by the host cell [1]. So, fast and well-timed diagnosis of these diseases is very important due to the limited treatment options. Virus detection usually requires specific methodologies and equipment as: cell culturing, antigen or antibody detection (ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase) hemagglutination assay, nucleic acid detection (Polymerase chain reaction) and gene sequencing [2], [3]. Most of these methods are time consuming, labor intensive and often expensive. Table 1\noffers a comparison of advantages and limitations of some of the most commonly used methods for virus detection. Therefore, we need rapid, simple, sensitive, and accurate methods for detection of pathogenic agents [4]. So in order to find alternative methodologies without the mentioned limitations, recently there has been growing attention for using biosensors in biomedical applications based on the advantages of these methods such as high speed results, excellent sensitivity and suitable selectivity [5]. Moreover, since viral and bacterial diseases are real menaces to human life, there is a growing demand to detect them meticulously by advanced methods [6]. Biosensors are highly accurate, sensitive and specific measurement systems that can determine very low analyte concentrations in biological samples. A biosensor is an analytical device which made up biological elements; such as microorganisms, organelles, cell receptor, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc. that produces signals (electrical, optical or thermal) based on the interaction with tested element and a transducer that converts these signals into a measurable electrical parameter [7]. Due to the use of specific biological elements, these measurement systems have unique properties for the identification and measurement of target analytes. The importance of biosensor components is to assure a high level of specificity based on particular binding sites. Different medical and clinical applications are expected for biosensors such as: i) fast diagnosis and treatment of illness like cancer or diabetes, ii) detection of pathogens, iii) measurement of drugs and their metabolites, iv) discovery of new drugs and v) evaluation of drug activity, vi) assessment and measurement of analytes in biological samples and early detection of diseases using rapid tests [7], [8], [9].",

Continuous decrease in material dimension, from large scale to small one in the range between 1 and 100 nm, does not change biosensor properties but significantly improves their applicability. The surface interaction of the sensors with analyte becomes highly efficient due to the extremely large surface to volume ratios in Nano-size devices [15]. Therefore, nanoscale materials show unique features, functionality, and effects. Nowadays, nanotechnology is focused on the elimination of disadvantages of existing methods for virus detection to minimize costs and time consuming. Furthermore, the use of nanomaterials in the construction of biosensors resulted in increasing of efficiency and sensitivity of these systems [16]. By designing the interaction between biological element and nanomaterial-based transducer, we can have biosensors by widely usage for the detection of biomolecules and disease diagnostics. These devices can detect patients physiological status at the moment and safety analyze the food and environmental samples for pesticides and water pollution quickly [17]. Several nanomaterials; such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, thin films, and nanoparticles have been explored for biomedical applications due to their functional electrical and mechanical features for biomedical applications [18].",

The emitted wavelength depends on the size of the QDs, the distance between energy bands in small QDs being higher than in larger ones. So, by illuminating small QDs with ultraviolet radiation, electrons move to high energy bar and loss additional energy by return to a steady state. Finally, visible light emitted from them has high energy and tends to blue. Also by using ultraviolet radiation to large QDs, visible light is emitted from them, in the reddish range, due to the loss of excess energy and return to a steady state, because of the small energy gap and less energy losing. So, by enlarging the size of the QDs, the light spectrum tends toward red from blue [20].",

This method can be applied to in-vitro selected aptamers for detecting a wide range of analytes such as small organic molecules and divalent cations. Lu et al. [70] proposed a FRET system, containing AuNRs and fluorescein (FAM), for the detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences. In this method AuNRs were synthesized and the surface of the AuNRs wrapped with a thin layer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), leading to the positive charge of AuNRs. Their designed, structure led to a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from FAM to AuNRs. The fluorescence intensity of FAM was consequently quenched. The decline of the fluorescence intensity of FAM (DF) was linear with the concentration of the complementary DNA from 0.045 to 6.0 nmol L\u22121 and the LOD was as low as 15 pmol L\u22121 (signal/noise ratio of 3).",

A major drawback of this particles is their inherent tendency to oxidize in ambient conditions. However, the properties of copper nanoparticles are well-established and base on their use, several biosensors for virus detection have been developed [90]. Also, from the chemical point of view, the process of producing CuNPs from its various salts is cost effective and simple such as hydrothermal procedures.

AIDs, smallpox, polio, influenza, diarrhea, and hepatitis are examples of the devastating effects of viral diseases that can affect the safety of people. Therefore, an initial warning system for proper detection and recognition of virus is required for eradicating viruses. Extensive investigation has been conducted for this purpose over decades. Meanwhile, the potential of nanotechnology in onset recognition of viruses is in the eye caching. These particles enhance mechanical, electrochemical, optical and magnetic properties of biosensors, and pave the way for an increased precision and selectivity of their detection. Herein we have critically discussed, the use of nanomaterials; such as nanoparticles and nanotubes in fabrication of different biosensors to detect pathogenic viruses. Several immobilization procedures, immunosensing schemes and their applications in various virus detection have been also mentioned. Although, biosensor technologies is highly promising, they present many challenges in order to move from the bench to their use in the point of care. Nanotechnologies offer new tools to overcome these challenges and perform direct detection of molecular targets in real time. Emerging graphene oxide, silica, carbon, gold, magnetic nanoparticles and nanotubes provide delicate and accurate platform in this field. Apart from mentioned advantages, to guarantee the profits of biosensors, further efforts should be considered concerning the appropriate selection of nanomaterials. The immobilization method of the concerned nanomaterials and biological elements is critical in order to minimize the risk of mistakes and errors in virus detection. Another important issue is lifetime of the assay, which is sometimes considerable. Indeed, great effort is required to provide portable and reusable devices capable for discriminating of viruses with high selectivity and sensitivity levels. To sum up, advances in nanotechnology will be in a near future a great breakthrough in medicine to halt viral diseases and provide a healthy life to potentially infected patients.",
