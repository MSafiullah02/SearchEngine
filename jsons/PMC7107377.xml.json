Parents monitored a set of symptoms in the study child each day, and when the definition of ARI was met we asked parents to collect a combined nose-throat swab specimen [18]. The specimen was couriered to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, where it underwent conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, with reverse-transcription PCR performed for RNA viruses, including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, HRVs, and enteroviruses [19]. PCR was conducted for adenoviruses [19]. Illnesses were classified as ARIs uncomplicated or complicated by fever and/or otitis media.",

Detection of each HRV species declined dramatically when detection of respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus increased and detection of influenza A virus peaked (in August [19]). HRV-A and HRV-C could be detected in subsequent ARI specimens from the same child, but HRV-B positivity did not recur for any child.

Three-to-five times more distinct HRV types were identified in our single-year cohort than would have been expected from the literature. Recently, van der Zalm et al identified 27 different subtypes among a cohort of 18 children sampled fortnightly during a six-month period [7]. Because a lower sequence threshold was used to identify those viruses, it is likely that the true number of HRV types was underestimated as compared to the higher threshold (96% vs 90%) we applied, which we considered essential when using the highly conserved 5\u2032UTR region. Recent cohort studies that also used the 5\u2032UTR for HRV typing identified 56 [23] distinct HRV types, including 32 new types [23], whereas other cohort studies have not conducted detailed typing analyses [24, 25]. Cohorts with longer follow-up [26] or more-frequent sampling than ours [27] unsurprisingly find greater numbers of HRV types since they span multiple seasons or have a better likelihood of sampling so-called \u201casymptomatic\u201d infections. Frequently, sampling in longitudinal cohort studies improves our understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in illness because it allows temporal association with signs and symptoms.",

These numbers might have been different if other virus, such as bocavirus, parainfluenza virus-4, and influenza C virus, had been included, but our previous findings suggest the adjustment would not have changed the significance of the virus-to-virus interaction [14]. Our observation most likely reflects the capacity of RNA viruses to efficiently trigger the early innate interferon response through interactions with a range of pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors 3 and 8, MDA5, and RIG-I. Whether DNA viruses are better adapted to interfere with a host interferon response or are better at exploiting the opportunities provided by RNA viruses remains to be defined.",

However, we have not found, nor has there been published evidence for, false genotyping (a 5\u2032UTR erroneously representing a polyprotein sequence from a different virus) of the \u2265100 HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C genomes fully sequenced to date. Even when an HRV-C type falls into the HRV-A clade phylogenetically, to date it exists within a distinct space in that clade. Carefully chosen sequence identity thresholds and experience can successfully produce robust genotyping results, as has been shown here and elsewhere in the literature [23, 26, 27, 30\u201332]. In this study, we found that each 5\u2032UTR sequence was a unique identifier of HRV type. Others suggest the HRVs are under positive selective pressure to remain conserved [33]. While this may not remain evident as more completed HRV genomes become available, no proof exists to support a theory that the 5\u2032UTR is an unsatisfactory target for genotyping, and it continues to be used successfully elsewhere [34]. Nevertheless, phylogeny based on the 5\u2032UTR region, whether partial or complete, does not accurately discriminate all members of the HRV-A species from those currently considered to be HRV-C but harboring elements of an HRV-A UTR [10]. This is similar to the phylogenetic patterns of enterovirus types derived from use of the 5\u2032UTR, in which the 4 known species are represented by only 2 clades. A longer target encompassing a 5\u2032UTR-VP2 stretch improves phylogenetic tree construction, and these sequences are becoming well represented in the GenBank sequence database [35]. However, until the HRV virome is completely characterized, it is also premature to assume that the 5\u2032UTR-VP2 region's apparent congruity with the rest of an HRV's polyprotein sequence will be maintained by the genomes of future distinct HRV strains. A VP1 target is less sensitive when used directly on clinical specimens [22] and is likely to underrepresent enterovirus diversity [36].",
