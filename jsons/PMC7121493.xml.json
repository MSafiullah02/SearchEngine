            "text": "Newly emerging and re-emerging infections of the respiratory tract pose considerable medical and public health concerns as well as economic hardships to humans and countries. The last century witnessed at least five pandemics: 1918/1919, H (viral hemagglutinin) 1 N (viral neuraminidase) 1 Spanish influenza; 1957, H2N2 Asia influenza; 1968, H3N2 Hong Kong influenza; 1977, H1N1 Russian influenza; and 1997, H5N1 bird influenza (reviewed Wright et al. 2007). In twenty-first century alone, two viral pandemics have already occurred\u2014the first was in 2002 when the new viral pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), appeared (reviewed Oldstone 2010), followed by the first influenza virus pandemic in 2009, H1N1 swine influenza (Dawood et al. 2012). Moreover, Hantaviruses have infected humans in the past and recently in an outbreak at Yellowstone National Park. These viral infections loom as important zoonotic human diseases with the threat of human to human transmission and excessively high mortality rates. For example, 1918/1919 H1N1 influenza infections caused the greatest loss of life from any infectious disease or medical condition known, visiting roughly 5 % of the world\u2019s population and killing 2 % or 40\u201350 million persons (Ahmed et al. 2007; Johnson and Mueller 2002). The most recent influenza pandemic, 2009 H1N1 swine influenza, rapidly infected millions worldwide with estimates exceeding 290,000 deaths of which more than 201,000 resulted from respiratory failure and over 83,000 from cardiovascular complications (Dawood et al. 2012). All of the above diseases in humans (Arankalle et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2011) and experimental animals (Baskin et al. 2009; Kobasa et al. 2007; Marcelin et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012) are accompanied by early exacerbation and dysregulation of innate immune responses, a combination of events called \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d Severe disease and death following infection correlated strongly with the cytokine storm.\n",

When the immune response is limited due to either host genetics, acquired defects like lymphoid diseases, immaturity of the immune system in fetuses, newborns, or young children, or loss of immune vigor in the aged, the advantage is firmly in the virus\u2019s court. However, usually when the infection occurs in individuals with a developed and competent immune system, the advantage is the host\u2019s, unless the infecting virus overwhelms the individual\u2019s immune system or the immune response becomes hyperactive resulting in an excessive innate and adoptive immune reaction, the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d phenomenon.

By this means, the spread of infection is diminished. Additionally antiviral drugs, which were developed as effective therapies to diminish or in some instances prevent ongoing infections, are reasonably effective, nevertheless come with two marked limitations. First, antiviral drugs exert selective pressure on viral progeny, promoting their mutation and selection thereby creating a new generation that is more fit and resistant to the drug (Nguyen et al. 2012; Orozovic et al. 2011). Second, the injury associated with these acute viral respiratory diseases, including influenza, results from a combination of the virus\u2019s intrinsic virulence in lysing cells it infects and the intensity of the immune response which can damage tissues and promote a cytokine storm. Antiviral drugs are effective against the virus but not against cytokine storm or immune-mediated injury.",

Further, we documented that cytokine storm was chemically treatable using an immunomodulatory small molecule, sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist, which dramatically inhibited the production of cytokines/chemokines and the innate cellular response, thereby blunting both the innate as well as the adoptive antiviral T cell response (Marsolais et al. 2009; Walsh et al. 2011; Teijaro et al. 2011). These events successfully limited immunopathologic injury. Nevertheless, a sufficient host T cell response remained and coupled with the antiviral antibody response curtailed the acute infection while providing recall immunologic memory to any renewed insult by the virus. This review focuses primarily on our experimental work that provided these conclusions.",

            "text": "An overly aggressive innate immune response, the early recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the lung and dysregulated immune gene expression were key contributors to morbidity from the 1918/1919 influenza virus onslaught, as suggested by experimental infection of macaques with the 1918 H1N1 virus strain (Kobasa et al. 2007; Cilloniz et al. 2009). Clinical studies of humans infected by H5N1 bird influenza virus revealed a significant association between excessive early cytokine responses and immune cell recruitment as strongly predictive of poor medical outcomes (de Jong et al. 2006). Recently, similar results for influenza virus infections were reported for experimental animal models (Baskin et al. 2009; Marcelin et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2012) and for humans (Arankalle et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2011). Among reports of H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza infections in humans, that of Arankalle et al. (2010) is illuminating. Analyzing viral events and cytokine storms in critically ill-hospitalized patients, the investigators showed that those who died had no difference in influenza viral load from those who recovered. However, the patients who recovered and left the hospital had significantly lower cytokine storm profiles than the population who succumbed from the infection. My colleague, Hugh Rosen, and I reasoned that calming the host\u2019s aggressive and exaggerated cytokine storm response might provide the opportunity to shift the balance from severe morbidity and mortality to survival. Our laboratories started jointly about 7 years ago to test this hypothesis (Marsolais et al. 2008). We selected the molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and sought to determine if harmful immunologic processes accompanying H1N1 2009 influenza infection could be modulated by S1P receptors in the lung. We selected S1P agonists because of their documented history of modulating lymphoid trafficking by inducing sequestration of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid regions. By that means, S1P agonists limit the migration of effector lymphocytes to areas where such cells mediate immunologic injury (Rosen et al. 2007, 2009, 2013; see Chaps.  1 (Rosen) and 6 (Cyster) in this volume)). S1P is a signaling lipid present at a concentration of 1\u20133 nM in plasma and approximately 100 nM in lymph. Physiologically, S1P levels are under tight homeostatic control, and S1P signals through specific S1P receptors of which there are five (S1P receptors 1\u20135). These five specific S1P receptors are coupled to different G proteins for the purpose of regulating a variety of downstream pathways specific for many cells, tissues, and organs (Rosen et al. 2007, 2009, 2013).",

            "text": "Infiltration of lymphoid cells into pulmonary tissues accompanies influenza virus infection. To identify and quantitate CD8 and CD4 cells that specifically recognize influenza and separate these virus-specific effector T cells from the majority of CD8 and CD4 bystander T cells nonspecifically drawn into the lung by chemotoxic attractants released during virally induced damage of infected pulmonary epithelial cells, we took advantage of the wealth of reagents we and others created for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Our colleague Yoshi Kawaoka and his co-workers used reverse genetics (Marsolais et al. 2009) to place the MHC Db-restricted immunodominant LCMV CD8 T cell epitope glycoprotein (Gp) aa31-41 and the MHC IAb restricted immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope Gp aa65-77 into the neuroaminidase stalk of WSN influenza virus. This technology generated a recombinant WSN Flu/LCMV virus that replicated in vivo displaying the same pulmonary geography as wild-type (wt) WSN virus. The experimental plan utilized GFP- or RFP-labeled, cloned LCMV recognition lymphocytes obtained from T cell receptor mice in which >98 % of CD8 fluoroprobe-labeled T lymphocytes recognized LCMV Gp aa31-41, and >97 % of CD4 fluoroprobe-labeled T lymphocytes recognized Gp aa65-77. Such GFP/RFP-labeled, virus-specific lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into na\u00efve H-2b C57Bl/6 mice where they resided in secondary lymphoid tissues as resting lymphocytes. Two days later the recombinant WSN Flu/LCMV was administered intratracheally. Virus replication in pulmonary epithelial cells (Fig. 1a) was followed by the infiltration of virus-specific CD8 T cells (red) and virus-specific CD4 T cells (green) (Fig. 1b) at day 6 (Marsolais et al. 2009). Kinetic study of infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T cells showed their arrival by day 4, peak amounts at days 6\u20138, and significant numerical decrease at day 10 postinfection (Fig. 1c). There are five S1P receptors, i.e., S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. Administration of S1P permissive agonist AAL-R, which signals on S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors but not the S1P2 receptor, significantly reduced the numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells entering the lung (Fig. 1d). The result was significant protection from pulmonary tissue injury (Fig. 1e) and related mortality (Fig. 1f) when compared to the effects of vehicle alone or use of a control isomer, AAL-S, that is not able to be phosphorylated and cannot signal S1P receptors. Blunting of innate cytokine and chemokine responses following AAL-R treatment was evident and remarkable at day 2 postinfluenza infection (Fig. 1g). All these observations were initially made with murine H1N1 WSN virus and later confirmed by use of the non-murine adopted human pathogenic H1N1 influenza viruses A/Wisconsin/WSLH34934/09 and A/California/04/09 (Walsh et al. 2011). In studies with all these influenza viruses, although cytokine/chemokine expression was significantly blunted by S1P agonist AAL-R, AAL-R-treated mice terminated the virus infection, displayed robust virus-specific CTL responses 7 days after influenza infection, as measured by 51chromium release assay, and also mounted vigorous specific memory T cell responses upon rechallenge with virus 40 days after the infection. Further, the kinetics, titers of neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies in sera, or immunoglobulin subtypes of either AAL-R or AAL-S or vehicle-treated mice were equivalent. Together, these results document the validity of our premise. That is, the permissive S1P agonist AAL-R, which signals via S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors, when given locally into the respiratory tract, down-modulated numbers of virus-specific T cells, decreased innate cytokine/chemokine expression in the lung parenchyma, and reduced the supply of innate inflammatory cells\u2014NK, PMN, and macrophages (Marsolais et al. 2009; Walsh et al. 2011)\u2014sufficiently to abort cytokine storm. The successful outcome was protection of the host from influenza virus infection while still providing an antiviral response that curtailed and eventually impeded the influenza infection. Our data indicated that 23 of 28 mice (82 %) receiving AAL-R were protected (P = <0.001; only five of 28 died from the infection) when compared to a dose of virus that killed approximately 80 % of vehicle- or AAL-S-treated mice (22 of 28 mice died) (Walsh et al. 2011). Interestingly, when an optimal dose of the currently used antiviral drug Tamiflu was administered by itself, protection was significantly less effective 50 % (14 lived of 28 mice treated) compared to survival after AAL-R therapy alone (80 %). These results document a prominent role for cytokine storm as the cause of death from influenza infection. Most important is the benefit of S1P agonist therapy for the victims of multiple influenza virus strains and especially those that are resistant to anti-neuraminidase therapy. Although greater benefit was obtained in blocking cytokine storms with the S1P agonist than with Tamiflu (82 % vs. 50 %) protection, administering both the antiviral drug and the S1P agonist as combined therapy was optimal, yielding a 96 % protection rate from influenza virus challenge (27 of 28 mice survived the infection) (Walsh et al. 2011).\n",

The biological functions of these various S1P receptors are dependent on the cell/tissue location of the receptors, their expression, and their activation. Knowing that a broadly permissive S1P agonist AAL-R, which signals via S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 but not S1P2 receptors, significantly downregulated the cytokine storm and protected mice from the effects of a pathogenic human H1N1 influenza infection (Fig. 1, Panels c\u2013g) (Walsh et al. 2011), we repeated the experiments shown in Fig. 1, Panels e\u2013g, using two S1P1-specific agonists, CYM-5542 (Walsh et al. 2011), or RP-002 (Teijaro et al. 2011). The results are displayed in Fig. 2 and indicate that either of the two specific S1P1 receptor agonists whose signal is entirely restricted to S1P1 receptors were as effective as the broadly permissive AAL-R that signals on S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. The S1P1-specific agonists CYM-5442 were administered intratracheally (2 mg/kg) and RP-002 intratracheally (3 mg/kg) or orally (6 mg/kg) (Teijaro et al. 2011). Both S1P1 receptor agonist molecules provided protection against a lethal intranasal challenge with human H1N1 A/Wisconsin/WSLH34934/09 or A/California/04/09 (Fig. 2b) and blunted cytokine storm (Fig. 2c and d). The S1P1 receptor agonists significantly inhibited secretions of cytokines and chemokines associated with influenza virus infection, namely IFN-\u03b1, CCL-2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL-3, CCL-5, CxCl-2, IL-1\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. Observations from several experiments indicated that amounts of these cytokines/chemokines were inhibited to a degree similar to that from AAL-R treatment. The S1P1 selective agonists also significantly blunted the accumulation of innate infiltrating inflammatory cells (Fig. 2, Panel d). Notable were the reductions of macrophages/monocytes (marked by CD11b+, LyG6\u2212, F480+), neutrophils (CD11b+, LyG6+\u2212, F480\u2212), and natural killer cells (NK1.1+, CD3\u2212). Correspondingly, the quantity of activation marker CD69 was significantly reduced following S1P1 agonist therapy. Further, pulmonary tissues also reflected S1P1\u2019s beneficial outcome, since histologic study of mice given this remedy manifested mostly open alveolar air spaces, diminished to negligible inflammatory cell infiltrates and neither edema nor hemorrhage in the lung tissue. Importantly, S1P1 agonist treatment did not enhance viral titers. Influenza infection was effectively terminated, and both anti-influenza neutralizing antibodies and anti-influenza virus CD8 T cells were generated. Although numbers of T cells were reduced compared to infected mice not receiving S1P1 agonist therapy, they were sufficient to terminate the infection. Further, immune memory was established following this S1P1-specific therapy.\n",

            "text": "Having identified S1P1rec signaling as the primary pathway for the initiation of cytokine storm, we sought to identify the cell or cells in the lung that expressed the S1P1 receptor. Since epithelial cells are the primary cells infected by influenza viruses, we suspected that S1P1 receptors might be located on those cells. To determine which pulmonary cell types bear the S1P1 receptor, we took advantage of eGFP-S1P1 receptor knock-in mice made by Stuart Cahalan in the Rosen laboratory (Cahalan et al. 2011, see Cahalan Chap. 4, this volume). In this strain of mice, the native S1P1 receptor was homologously replaced with a functional fused eGFP-tagged S1P1 receptor (Cahalan et al. 2011). Utilizing this mouse model, we could directly detect eGFP-S1P1 receptor protein expression on pulmonary cells by using antibodies to specific pulmonary cell markers and flow cytometry (Fig. 3, Panel a). Additional substantiation came from biochemical analysis of these purified pulmonary cells (Fig. 3, Panel b). S1P1-eGFP receptor expression was plentiful on lung lymphatic (CD45\u2212, CD31+, GP38+) and vascular (CD45\u2212, CD31+, GP38\u2212) endothelial cells but, surprisingly, was absent on pulmonary epithelial cells (CD45\u2212, CD31\u2212, EpCAM+) (Fig. 3, Panel a) (Teijaro et al. 2011). These results were confirmed by doing Western blots on >98.5 % pure populations of pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells (Fig. 3, Panel b). As expected and previously reported, CD4 T cells (CD4+, CD3+), CD8 T cells (CD8+, CD3+), and B cells (B200+, CD19+) also expressed the S1P1-eGFP receptor (Fig. 3, Panel a). In contrast, pulmonary leukocytes, including macrophages/monocytes (CD11c+, CD11b\u2212, F480+), dendritic cells (CD11c+, IA-IE+, CD205+, F480\u2212), neutrophils, NK cells (NK1.1+, CD3\u2212) (Fig. 3, Panel a), and immature lymphoid cells (LIN\u2212, SCA-1+) failed to express significant levels of eGFP-S1P1 receptor protein. S1P1-eGFP receptor expression was similar whether cells were harvested from mice that were uninfected or infected with influenza virus. Other experiments in infected mice indicated that S1P1-eGFP receptor expression was not altered during influenza virus infection. Importantly, S1P1 agonist treatment of infected eGFP-S1P1 receptor knock-in mice did not lessen expression of the S1P1-eGFP receptors indicating that administration of specific S1P1 agonist does not degrade the endothelial S1P1 receptor. These results signify that the functional agonism of S1P1, not its antagonist effect of receptor degradation, was the mechanism by which S1P1 receptor blocking molecules CYM-5442 and RP-002 suppressed cytokine storms. In other studies, pulmonary endothelial cells were processed to a greater than 98.5 % purity during the first 48 h following influenza virus infection and treated with S1P1 agonist. Assessment of both RNA and protein levels showed that the S1P1 agonist CYM-5442 effectively decreased amounts of cytokines and chemokines made by vascular as well as lymphatic pulmonary endothelial cells (Fig. 3b).\n",

We therefore determined whether lymphocytes expressing S1P1 receptors were involved in S1P1 agonist inhibition of cytokine storm or were merely bystander cells accompanying the innate immune response to influenza virus infection. Since Rag2-/- mice are deficient in lymphocytes, we reasoned that if such mice, when infected with influenza virus, generated a cytokine storm that could be blocked by S1P1 agonist, then lymphocytes were ruled out as initiators of cytokine storms. Our experiments documented that cytokine storm occurred in Rag2-/- mice infected with influenza virus. Importantly, treatment of infected Rag2-/- mice with the S1P1 agonist CYM-5442 significantly reduced cytokines and chemokines in the bronchial lavage fluids as well as minimalizing the infiltration of innate cells (macrophages/monocytes and NK cells). Recently, John Teijaro (2013), utilizing cell sorting and a biochemical approach, found S1P1 receptor on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) whose expression was undetectable in the S1P1-\u03b3 GFP transgenic mouse model.",

            "text": "As observed in Fig. 4a and b and detailed in Teijaro et al. 2011, amounts of type I interferon and almost exclusively the interferon-\u03b1 species were elevated early after acute influenza virus infection. The release and action of type I interferon was crucial for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, since blockage of the type I interferon response by using monoclonal antibody to interferon-\u03b1-\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR1) significantly reduced the quantity of pulmonary cytokines/chemokines associated with acute influenza infection (Fig. 4b). Further, treatment with S1P1 receptor agonist inhibited the production of interferon-\u03b1 in the pulmonary bronchial lavage fluid early after initiating influenza virus infection. Proof that this blunting of interferon-\u03b1 production was a mechanism by which S1P1 receptor agonist inhibited cytokine storm derived from use of IFNAR1 receptor knock-out mice infected with H1N1 virus and treated with S1P1 receptor agonist CYM-5442. Such studies showed a significant reduction of cytokines/chemokines (IFN-\u03b1, CCL-2, IL-6 (shown Fig. 4c), IFN-\u03b3, CCL-5, CxCl-0, not shown) in the bronchial lavage fluid when compared to results from similar experimentation in mice with an intact interferon-\u03b1-\u03b2 receptor signaling ability (Fig. 4c). Of interest, blockage of interferon-\u03b1-\u03b2 receptor signaling did not retard pulmonary infiltration by the inflammatory cells\u2014macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, or NK cells\u2014following S1P1 receptor agonist therapy (Fig. 4d). Thus, the infiltration of innate inflammatory cells was blunted only in interferon-\u03b1-\u03b2 sufficient mice but not in interferon-\u03b1-\u03b2 receptor knock-out mice. This outcome indicates that regulation of such cell recruitment into the lung was primarily mediated by endothelial cells and was independent of type I interferon signaling (Teijaro et al. 2011). Cytokine/chemokine production in the lung was also mediated by pulmonary endothelial cells, and S1P1 receptor agonism of such cells inhibited interferon-\u03b1 production leading to the significantly diminished inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses we observed.\n",

            "text": "Influenza virus infection induces a robust interferon type I response, despite the early induction of the viral NS1 protein that suppresses the cellular induction of and response to interferon I (Fernandez-Sesma 2007). The predominant type I interferon produced early following influenza virus infection is alpha, not beta (Fig. 4a). However, the cellular sources of interferon type I-\u03b1 produced and amounts made by various cell populations have not been clear. The two major pulmonary cell populations known to make type I interferon in vivo following respiratory viral infections are pDCs and alveolar macrophages (Kumagai et al. 2007). To judge the contribution of pDCs to interferon-\u03b1 production in the lung, we utilized a novel mouse model recently developed at Scripps by Bruce Beutler and termed \u201cfeeble.\u201d Feeble mice have a specific genetic defect that prevents their pDCs from producing type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon activation of TLR7 and TLR9 ligands by influenza virus stimulation (Blasius et al. 2010). Importantly, there is no disruption of the numbers or vitality of pDCs, and the feeble mouse defect is specifically restricted to pDCs. As displayed in Fig. 4e, when wild type or feeble mice received H1N1 human 2009 swine influenza with or without S1P1 agonist CYM5442 treatment, 75\u201385 % of total interferon-\u03b1 was produced by pDCs. Further, interferon-\u03b1 release was significantly inhibited by the S1P1 agonist CYM-5442. These results were confirmed using a pDC depletion antibody (anti-PDCS-1 clone 120.68), which again resulted in significant depletion of pDCs in the lung and corresponding reductions in interferon-\u03b1, CCL2, CCL5, and IL-6. Thus, pDCs are the essential and major producers of interferon-\u03b1 (75\u201385 %) and involved in amplification of cytokine/chemokine volumes following influenza infection. Other depletion studies indicate that most of the remaining interferon-\u03b1 production (~15\u201325 %) was by alveolar macrophages.",

This model is based on presence of S1P1 receptors on pulmonary endothelial and pDCs but their absence on lung epithelial cells and the findings that alveolar macrophages which produce type I interferon do not display S1P1 receptors on their surfaces. However, pulmonary endothelial cells and pulmonary pDCs do express S1P1 receptors on their surfaces. Cytokines/chemokines elicit the initial cytokine storm reflective of factors (viral or nonviral) produced by the influenza virus-infected lung epithelial cells per se. These factors likely activate pulmonary pDCs and alveolar macrophages to release interferon-\u03b1. As chemotoxic factors are then liberated into the site of action, infiltrating cells of the innate immune system (macrophages/monocytes, NK cells, leukocytes) are drawn into the inflammatory milieu where they release additional cytokines/chemokines.\n",

Here influenza virus-specific T cells are activated and expand numerically in the mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary tissues. These T cells of the adoptive immune system produce additional inflammatory molecules and lyse influenza virus-infected epithelial cells thereby augmenting cytokine storm and immune-mediated injury. This second phase of tissue injury is primarily influenza virus\u2013specific T cell-mediated and signals through S1P1 but also likely progresses via S1P3 and 4 receptors, as by our preliminary results. However, additional data are required to ensure these observations. What is clear is that treatment with S1P permissive-AAL-R agonists signaling via S1P1,3,4,5 receptors affect adoptive immune T cell-mediated immunopathology by downregulating MHC and co-stimulatory molecules of DCs located in the mediastinal lymph nodes and the lung parenchyma thereby blunting the arming, expansion, and migration of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells into the lung (Marsolais et al. 2009).",
