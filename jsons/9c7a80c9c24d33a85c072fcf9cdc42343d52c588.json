Chest X-ray demonstrates viral pneumonia mainly as interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia. During its early stage, chest X-ray demonstrates enhanced but poorly defined lung markings, predominantly in the both lower lung fields, with increased density like GGO. During the progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with reticular opacity and reticular nodules, which mainly distribute in both lower lung fields and around the hilum, with a diameter of less than 5 mm. During the advanced stage, bronchiolar inflammatory occlusion causes cystic changes in different sizes, with honeycomb like lung.

Klebsiella pneumonia is an acute lung inflammation caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which commonly occurs in populations of those with chronic alcoholism or malnutrition and the elderly. Chest X-ray demonstrations can be classified into 3 types: increased lung markings type; lobular type or diffuse pneumonia type; and lobar consolidation type or lung abscess type. Compared to chest X-ray, CT scan can more favorably display the lesions. In its early stage, Klebsiellar pneumonia is demonstrated with lobular sporadic distribution of patches or irregular dense opacities, which involve multiple lung segments and fuse rapidly to show lobar consolidation in the right upper lung lobe. Due to the thick exudated fluid from the lesion, the interlobar fissure is demonstrated to drop. The lesions are susceptible to necrosis, followed by formation of lung abscess, which is commonly multiple small cavities with a diameter of less than 2 cm. The healing proce ss of these cavities is long, commonly with residual extensive fibrosis. Mycoplasma pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection and pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia, with common occurrence in both children and adults. Most of the patients show cold agglutination test positive. In its early stage, chest X-ray demonstrates increased poorly defined lung markings and blurry cloud like or homogenous opacities, commonly in the middle and lower lung fields. Such opacities adjacent to the hilum are dense, and its density gradually lightens along with its distance from the hilum, with poorly defined boundary and involvement of partial lung lobe. Mycoplasma pneumonia with lobar lesion can not be differentiated from lobar pneumonia induced by other pathogenic bacteria. Chest CT scan mainly shows ground glass like opacity in lungs, nodular or small patches of consolidation with air cavity, thickened bronchovascular bundle, buds-in-tree sign, large consolidation as well as accompanying mediastinal lymphadenectasis and pleural effusion.",

Its pathological changes include pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary atelectasis, with clinical manifestations of acute respiratory failure syndrome characterized by progressive respiratory distress and intractable hypoxemia. The radiological abnormalities of ARDS are related to leakage of edema fluid containing a large amount of protein and its filling into the alveolar cavity after damage to the alveolar epithelium or diffuse damage to alveolar wall. And its staging by radiology is closely related to the pathological changes, including the exudative stage, the proliferative stage and the fibrosis stage, with intercorrelationship and overlapping. Chest X-ray commonly demonstrates diffuse opacity in both lungs, and detectable lesions of the underlying disease, e.g. severe pneumonia induced by a variety of pathogens. CT scan demonstrates uneven distribution of the lesions: (1) with almost no abnormality in the gravity independent region (e.g. supine, anterior thoracic cavity); (2) with GGO in the anterior and middle thoracic cavity; and (3) with consolidation in the gravity dependent region.",

Chest X-ray demonstrates viral pneumonia mainly as interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia. In its early stage, chest X-ray demonstrates enhanced but poorly defined lung markings, predominantly both lower lung fields, with increased density like GGO. In its progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with reticular opacity or reticular nodules and the nodules commonly distribute in the both lower lung fields and around the hilum, with a diameter of less than 5 mm. It its advanced stage, bronchiolar inflammatory occlusion causes cystic changes in different sizes to show honeycomb like lung, with shrinkage of lung, elevated diaphragm and shift of interlobar fissure. CT scan demonstrates small nodular opacity, ground glass opacity, tree-buds sign and mosaic like perfusion in lungs. Chest X-ray demonstrates bacterial pneumonia mainly as alveolar pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia. Alveolar pneumonia is demonstrated as lobar consolidation with high uniform density or consolidation with high uniform density occupying part of lung lobe, with air bronchogram inside and one or multiple lung lobes involved. Bronchial pneumonia is demonstrated as thickened lung markings, poorly defined nodular or flakes of opacity in a diameter of 6-8 mm. Bronchial occlusion by mucus can be demonstrated as lobular atelectasis or focal emphysema in the diseased area. The lesions are commonly located in the medial part of both lower lung fields, with more in the posterior lung lobe than in the anterior lung lobe, that distribute along bronchial branches. And the segmental and lobar bronchi show smooth air flow. CT scan demonstrates consolidations with uniform shape and lobar distribution, with air bronchogram inside, and poorly defined nodular or patches of opacities of different sizes along bronchial bundles as well as lobular atelectasis and focal emphysema. Pulmonary edema and acute or chronic systolic or diastolic heart dysfunction due to various etiological factors can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vein and pulmonary capillaries as well as pulmonary congestion. The liquid firstly accumulates in the perivascular sheath in lungs and interlobular space to cause pulmonary interstitial edema, which then flow into the alveolar cavity to cause pulmonary parenchyma edema. Chest X-ray demonstrates interstitial edema as thickened, deranged and re-ranged lung markings, thickened but poorly defined vascular markings in both upper lung fields, enlarged and dense hilar opacities in both lungs, thickened and dilated but poorly defined vascular markings in the middle and medial parts of both lung fields. However, chest X-ray demonstrates interstitial edema with fine vascular markings in peripheral lung field and well defined peripheral lung field. Its further progression can be demonstrated with flakes of opacity in both lungs with butterfly wing like shape and concentric distribution. Chest X-ray demonstrates alveolar edema as initially poorly defined flakes of opacities in different sizes with sporadic distribution in both lungs. Along with its progression, chest X-ray demonstrates large flakes of high density opacity after fusion, which extends from the hilum to the peripheral lung with gradually light density, in typical butterfly wing like sign. a b Fig. 8.4 Chest X-ray demonstrated decreased transparency of both lung fields and large consolidation opacity in both lungs, with air bronchogram inside (a). Reexamination after treatment for 2 days showed that absence of lung markings in both lungs, further decreased transparency of both lung fields, and diffuse high density in both lungs (b)",
