PRRs recognize viral components, both proteins and nucleic acids, as signatures of \u201cnon-self\u201d that are the sign of an infection in place and are named pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Kumar et al., 2011). Upon PAMPs recognition, PRRs initiate a signaling cascade which culminates with the induction of type I alpha/beta interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2). These cytokines act in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to promote viral clearance or induce apoptosis in infected cells, to establish an antiviral state in non-infected cells and to modulate the priming of optimal antigen-specific T cell and antibody adaptive response (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008).",

Among these, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) moieties, especially those with the atypically-featured 5\u2032-triphosphate (5\u2032-ppp) termini, have no homologues in the cytoplasm and therefore represent the most efficient triggers for PRRs activation (Gerlier and Lyles, 2011). Given the central dsRNA role in stimulating IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction, a subset of PRRs is specifically dedicated to its detection and, depending on their cell compartments localization, can be ascribed to two families. dsRNA recognition in endosomes, lysosomes and even at the extracellular surface is accomplished by the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), a member of the TLR family (Barbalat et al., 2011), while dsRNA recognition in the cytosolic environment is carried out by RNA helicases belonging to the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) family (Wilkins and Gale, 2010), named after the first characterized member, RIG-I (Yoneyama et al., 2004).",

Therefore, most, if not all, RNA viruses encode proteins that display IFN-antagonism properties aimed to circumvent the host innate immune system. Among those proteins, most have been revealed as involved in targeting the RLR pathway at several levels (Versteeg and Garcia-Sastre, 2010). The impact of this counteraction becomes particularly evident for those RNA viruses that cause severe diseases in humans, since in several cases the fatal outcome has been related to their ability to subvert the type I IFN-mediated innate immune response (Bray, 2005). It is therefore not surprising that, among the different viral proteins identified as inhibitors of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and signaling, most are also molecular determinants of virulence and pathogenesis (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008, Versteeg and Garcia-Sastre, 2010).",

Accordingly, it was demonstrated that the addition of dsRNA, of either viral (Nemes et al., 1969, Tytell et al., 1967) or synthetic origin (Field et al., 1972b), to the culture medium of several cell lines, as well as its intracellular delivery, resulted in a robust type I IFN response (Marcus 1983). Thereafter, several studies aimed to dissect the cellular IFN-based antiviral response by using polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) to mimic the dsRNA intermediates that are present during viral infections. After more than two decades, such efforts led to the identification of TLR3 as the receptor responsive to dsRNA internalized by endocytosis (Alexopoulou et al., 2001) and, later, to the discovery of RLRs as the class of molecules that detects dsRNA in the cytoplasm (Andrejeva et al., 2004, Yoneyama et al., 2004, Yoneyama et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Indeed, how and when base-paired RNA sequences were generated and/or were freely exposed during infection by different viruses has represented the main question of several studies. On the one hand, the use of polyI:C as viral mimetic, while demonstrating that the double-helical nature of RNA is itself a potent IFN inducer (Hausmann et al., 2008), somehow depicted an artificial recognition process by RLRs. On the other hand, while viral dsRNAs of genomic length were able to activate RLRs pathway to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (DeWitte-Orr et al., 2009, Kato et al., 2008), immunofluorescence analysis with dsRNA-specific monoclonal antibody showed detectable amounts of dsRNA only in cells infected by some positive-stranded (+)-RNA viruses, whereas no dsRNA was detected in cells infected by negative-stranded (\u2212)-RNA viruses (Weber et al., 2006). Currently, apart from dsRNA viruses for which the dsRNA PAMP is the viral genome itself, it is generally assumed that other viruses produce this PAMP as a replicative byproduct. In DNA viruses, for example, dsRNA may be generated through the self-annealing of convergent bidirectional transcription products (Weber et al., 2006). (+)-RNA viruses, whose single-stranded genomes directly serve for the translation of viral proteins, generate (\u2212)-ssRNA antigenome templates and newly-synthesized (+)-ssRNA genomes during their replication, and both these products are susceptible of base-pairing into dsRNA with their complementary template strand (Ahlquist, 2006). (\u2212)-RNA viruses transcribe monocistronic mRNAs from every gene and during the replication step synthesize viral genomes and antigenomes from a template that is tightly encapsidated by nucleoproteins. This encapsidation occurs concomitantly to RNA synthesis, since it is strictly required by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex for its attachment and progression along the template (Morin et al., 2013). As a result, RNA encapsidation also prevents double-strand formation, since no genomic or antigenomic intermediates are normally found naked in the cytoplasm and they therefore cannot anneal to each other to produce dsRNA moieties (Gerlier and Lyles, 2011).",

However, viral replication and transcription are both processes susceptible to errors, which may lead to occasional production of defective transcripts and abortive 5\u2032-genome and antigenome ends that, annealing one to each other or self-pairing into panhandle-like secondary structures, become ideal IFN-inducing viral PAMP candidates (Gerlier and Lyles 2011). In line with this, defective interfering (DI) RNAs generated through genome copyback during Sendai virus (SeV) infection, as well as subgenomic DI particles from IAV were found to potently activate the IFN response and act as RLR ligands (Strahle et al., 2006, Baum et al., 2010).",

Moreover, the presence of an RNA double helix is essential for RLRs to induce a type I IFN-based response (Schlee and Hartmann, 2010), as ssRNA molecules which did not undergo self-pairing and double-stranded secondary structures were unable to bind and activate RIG-I (Schlee et al., 2009, Schmidt et al., 2009). However, the fact that some endogenous short dsRNAs of annealed antisense transcripts and microRNA precursors with secondary-stem loops \u2013 that are occasionally present at low levels in mammalian cells \u2013 do not elicit any IFN response, demonstrated that RNA double-strandness alone may be not sufficient for proper RLRs stimulation (Lehner et al., 2002, Marques et al., 2006, Werner, 2005).",

At the end of transcription, covalent attachment of a cap structure assures the complete removal of 5\u2032-ppp (Decroly et al., 2011), whereas the triphosphates at 5\u2032-genome termini are either processed or enwrapped by viral nucleoproteins into homo-polymeric nucleocapsids (Choi, 2012). However, 5\u2032-ppp groups may be inadvertently exposed to the cytosolic environment in byproducts such as leader RNAs, as well as defective replicative intermediates that remain uncapped (Gerlier and Lyles, 2011). In addition to viral genome replication and transcription, the uncoating process to which viral nucleocapsids are subjected immediately after infection represents another critical moment for the recognition of 5\u2032-ppp and panhandle structures. In line with this, a recent study showed that RIG-I was able to physically interact with, and to be activated by, nucleocapsids from several negative-stranded (\u2212)-RNA viruses, independently from viral RNA synthesis (Weber et al., 2013).",

In summary, byproducts of viral replication and transcription (Rehwinkel et al., 2010) or DI RNAs (Baum et al., 2010, Strahle et al., 2006), as wells as unmodified 5\u2032-ppp ends and dsRNA panhandle structures that come from newly-infecting virions (Weber et al., 2013) are all theoretically prone to provide double-stranded structures, originated through self-pairing or annealing with complementary sequences.

In RIG-I and MDA5, but not in LGP2, the helicase domain is preceded by two tandemly-repeated N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) (Yoneyama et al., 2005). Unlike other members of the SF2 helicases, which bind one strand of the nucleic acid to unwind its double helix (Fairman-Williams et al., 2010), RLRs have double-strand specificity and do not seem to display unwinding activity. Indeed, a weak unwinding was initially described for a RIG-I deletion mutant (Marques et al., 2006) as well as for the full length protein in the presence of dsRNA substrates with overhangs at the 3\u2032 strand longer than 5 nts (Takahasi et al., 2008). However, lack of RIG-I helicase activity was reported by subsequent studies (Myong et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2012). Instead, RLRs bind to both dsRNA strands and translocate onto it in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (Bamming and Horvath, 2009, Myong et al., 2009).",

Upon dsRNA binding to the CTD (Civril et al., 2011), the pincer motif is relieved from CARDs that are then displaced from the Hel2i allowing its binding to dsRNA (Luo et al., 2011). Subsequent to dsRNA enwrapping to Hel domains, RIG-I dimerization and activation of its ATPase activity take place (Cui et al., 2008). ATP hydrolysis propels the translocation of the RIG-I dimer along dsRNA (Myong et al., 2009) and an overall conformational change releases N-terminal CARDs for signaling (Jiang et al., 2011). Freely exposed RIG-I CARDs then interact with unanchored Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub) chains (Zeng et al., 2010). Next, RIG-I homo-oligomerization and ATP-ase-driven translocation along dsRNA take place (Patel J.R. et al., 2013), leading to additional conformational changes that provide the signaling platform for interaction with the CARDs of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) (Kawai et al., 2005). This is a mitochondrion-associated protein, now called mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (Seth et al., 2005), formerly also known as IFN-\u03b2 inducing CARD adaptor (Cardif) (Meylan et al., 2005) or virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) (Xu et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Essential for the prosecution of immune signaling, the redistribution of RIG-I from the cytosol to mitochondrial membranes is sustained by the formation of a translocon that involves the mitochondrion-targeting chaperone 14-3-3 \u03b5 and the tripartite motif 25 alpha (TRIM25\u03b1) E3 ligase (Liu et al., 2012). Furthermore, in addition to RIG-I activation via unanchored polyubiquitin chains, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I CARDs by TRIM25\u03b1 was found to be important for the interaction with MAVS (Gack et al., 2007). In turn, such activity of TRIM25\u03b1 requires another E3 ligase, namely RING finger protein leading to RIG-I activation (Riplet) (Oshiumi et al., 2009, Oshiumi et al., 2010), whose polyubiquitination of RIG-I CTD facilitates the release of CARDs and their association with TRIM25\u03b1 (Oshiumi et al., 2013). At this point, the described mechanism, even though proposed as a general model for dsRNA recognition by RLRs, is mostly based on the characterization of RIG-I. However, the activation and signaling of MDA5 shows some differences. For instance, CARDs are not sequestered in the MDA5 resting form, and its activation \u2013 for which both ATPase activity and Lys-63-linked ubiquitination are also important \u2013 results in the cooperative assembly of MDA-5 protomers onto dsRNA helical filaments (Berke and Modis, 2012, Jiang et al., 2012, Peisley et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2013). Next, prosecution of the pathway involves MAVS prion-like polymerization (Hou et al., 2011) and the recruitment of two adaptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) essential modifier (NEMO), which connect and regulate signaling between the upstream sensory domain of MAVS and the downstream complex formed by TRAF family member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and inducible IkB kinase epsilon (IKK-\u03b5) (Oganesyan et al., 2005, Zhao et al., 2007, Belgnaoui et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012). The two kinases TBK-1 and IKK-\u03b5 carry out the phosphorylation of latent IFN regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF-3/7), leading to their dimerization and nuclear translocation (Fitzgerald et al., 2003).",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the recruitment of RIG-I to MAVS (Liu et al., 2012) and the interaction of TBK1-IKK-\u03b5 complex with MAVS are two critical events for IRF phosphorylation. In particular, in the latter was found involved a newly-identified adaptor that acts as an RLR signaling enhancer, independently discovered by three research groups and variously termed stimulator of interferon genes (STING), mediator of IRF-3 activation (MITA) and endoplasmic reticulum IFN stimulator (ERIS), respectively (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008, Sun et al., 2009, Zhong et al., 2008). Once in the nucleus, IRF-3 and 7 homo- or hetero-dimers associate into an enhanceosome with other transcription factors, such as cAMP response element-binding (CREB) binding protein/p300, NF-kB, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and c-Jun to drive the transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes (Panne et al., 2007). In turn, secreted type I IFNs act towards the same cell, or the neighboring ones, by binding to their ubiquitous cognate receptors and activating a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties (Sadler and Williams, 2008). Some ISGs encode for effectors that are able to directly interfere with the viral replication cycle, such as the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM), ribonuclease L (RNase L), 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), Viperin, myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) proteins (Liu et al., 2011). In addition, since among the ISGs products are also the PRRs, their adaptor molecules and transcription factors such as the IRFs, the expression of these proteins determines an amplification loop that increases both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISGs production, thereby establishing an overall antiviral state to limit virus spread and eventually clear the infection (Sadler and Williams, 2008).",

RIG-I optimal ligands are short 5\u2032-ppp-containing dsRNA molecules less than 20 bp in length (Lu et al., 2010, Jiang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2010) and, while it can also bind 5\u2032-hydroxyl (OH) blunt-ended dsRNA (Lu et al., 2011, Luo et al., 2011, Kowalinski et al., 2011), the presence of the 5\u2032-ppp group is essential for its proper activation (Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006, Rehwinkel et al., 2010). The 5\u2032-ppp recognition is imparted by a set of key basic residues that form a positively-charged pocket within the RIG-I CTD, thus allowing efficient accommodation of the three phosphates (Cui et al., 2008, Lu et al., 2010, Takahasi et al., 2009). However, even though RIG-I recognizes 5\u2032-ppp dsRNA by end-capping it (Lu et al., 2011, Luo et al., 2011), the 5\u2032-ppp feature alone is not sufficient for efficient IFN induction, and at least small regions of dsRNA terminal base-pairing are required for proper interaction with the helicase (Lu C. et al., 2011). In particular, double-strandness must encompass the 5\u2032 nucleotide carrying the triphosphate and 5\u2032 overhang at the 5\u2032-ppp end abolishes RIG-I activity (Schlee et al., 2009). Instead, 3\u2032 overhangs are tolerated, although decreasing RIG-I binding (Schlee et al., 2009) or supporting its ATPase activity without inducing IFN response (Schmidt et al., 2009).",

In fact, provided the substrate is long enough, multiple internal initiation binding sites can compensate for the absence of the 5\u2032-ppp at dsRNA ends (Binder et al., 2011). In agreement with the cooperative oligomerization of RIG-I along dsRNA, whose efficiency is in turn correlated with the strength of IFN induction (Patel J.R. et al., 2013), such flexible behavior allows RIG-I to integrate the two distinct signals of high-affinity motif and dsRNA length, thereby displaying the highest possible sensitivity in response to diverse PAMPs to be detected (Binder et al., 2011).",

Moreover, such high molecular weight moieties are bound by MDA5 regardless of the nature of the dsRNA 5\u2032-ends, since the MDA5 CTD has a flat basic surface that lacks the RIG-I-like 5\u2032-ppp-lodging pocket and does not cap dsRNA terminus (Li et al., 2009a, Takahasi et al., 2009). Instead, MDA5 binds to the dsRNA backbone parallel to the helix axis and multimerizes into helical filaments along dsRNA (Berke et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2013). Less is known about LGP2, the third member of the RLRs, which was shown to bind blunt-ended dsRNA in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (Bruns et al., 2013, Murali et al., 2008) and regardless the presence of 5\u2032-ppp (Li et al., 2009b, Pippig et al., 2009). Displaying a complex phenotype, LGP2 plays negative as well as positive roles in IFN induction. In fact, it negatively regulates RIG-I (Rothenfusser et al., 2005, Yoneyama et al., 2005) while it was shown to facilitate viral dsRNA recognition (Bruns et al., 2013, Satoh et al., 2010) and to act as positive regulator of MDA5, with which it co-operates in response to polyI:C stimulation (Childs et al., 2013).",

Any of the several components involved in the different phases of the innate antiviral response can be targeted by viruses. However, the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production achieved by blocking the RLR pathway in its upstream portion, at the level of dsRNA recognition, is a target shared by most viral antagonists, further evidencing the potency of such PAMP in triggering a robust innate immune response (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008). RNA viruses, of which several are pathogenic to humans, have developed a plethora of solutions to avoid dsRNA-mediated activation of RLRs. These can be ascribed to three strategies, hereby named as1.\nHide, that indicates dsRNA sequestration to prevent its binding to RLRs, and is achieved either by viral proteins competing with RLRs for dsRNA binding or by shielding dsRNA through its compartmentalization within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4\nA);2.\nMask, that relies on the ability of viral proteins to process double-helix and 5\u2032-ppp termini, removing the PAMP signatures recognized by RLRs (Fig. 4B);3.\nHit, that involves physical interaction between viral proteins and either RLRs or their downstream adaptors to suppress their functionalities (Fig. 5\n).\n",

Conversely, the direct Hit towards RLRs, or their effectors, appears to be the most multifaceted strategy given the high number of cellular components involved so that, in most cases, the mechanism through which viral antagonists exert such inhibition still remain to be elucidated. According to these three strategies, we reviewed here solutions adopted by a number of RNA viruses that are highly lethal to humans and for which effective medical countermeasures are currently lacking (Table 1\n).",

Early studies identified NP as sufficient for the inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation and consequent suppression of IFN induction, thereby highlighting its innate immune antagonist nature (Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2006, Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2007). Recently, structural and functional characterization of LASFV NP revealed that this property relies on the ability of the protein to process viral dsRNA with a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (Fig. 6\nA). In fact, while the N-terminal NP folds into a domain important for mRNA capping during transcription, a large cavity within its C-terminal domain exhibits a dsRNA 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease activity with a catalytic site comprising residues D389, E391, D466, D533 and H528, and structurally resembling the active sites of the DEDDH exonuclease superfamily (Qi et al., 2010). Notably, these amino acids reside within the same NP region (residues 370\u2013553) mapped for the anti-IFN activity of the OW lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which contains critical residues along its DIEGR motif (residues 382\u2013386) as well as at positions D459, H517 and D522 (Jiang et al., 2013, Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2009, Qi et al., 2010).",

In fact, confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses have revealed that arenaviral NPs bind to the kinase domain of IKK-\u03b5, blocking its autocatalytic activity and inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF-3 substrate. IKK-\u03b5 sequestration by arenaviral NPs impedes the interaction between this kinase and its mitochondrial partner MAVS, thereby shutting down signaling along the RLR pathway (Pythoud et al., 2012). Importantly, no interactions were observed between NP and other components of the pathway, such as TBK-1, MAVS, TRAF3 and even RIG-I or MDA5 (Pythoud et al., 2012), although for the latter another study reported a co-IP with the NP of LCMV (Zhou et al., 2010). Notably, the NP-IKK-\u03b5 interaction is disrupted by mutating the same NP residues that are critical for its 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease activity, suggesting the existence of an overlap in the domains responsible for the two IFN-antagonist functions (Pythoud et al., 2012).",

Overexpression of the JUNV Z protein blocked IRF-3 and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and decreased IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels in response to both SeV and 5\u2032-ppp dsRNA stimulation (Fan et al., 2010, Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2006, Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2007). Furthermore, confocal microscopy and co-IP revealed that the Z proteins of GTOV, JUNV, MACV and SABV, but not of LCMV and LASFV, are able to interact with RIG-I, preventing its recruitment to MAVS for downstream signaling (Fan et al., 2010). The mechanism of such inhibiting interaction, as well as the molecular details in terms of involved domain/s and critical residues in the Z protein, remain to be elucidated.",

HTNV 5\u2032-ppp moieties are trimmed off during the synthesis of viral genome through a \u201cprime and realign\u201d process that cleaves the first-incorporated nucleotide leaving a 5\u2032 monophosphorylated terminus (Garcin et al., 1995). Furthermore, in addition to being devoid of RIG-I-stimulating 5\u2032-ppp, the HTNV genome has complementary 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-strands that form perfectly paired panhandle structures that are promptly encapsidated by viral nucleocapsid proteins (Garcin et al., 1995). For CCHFV, whose genomic RNA bears a terminal pyrimidine residue at the 5\u2032-end, in place of the purine normally used by viral polymerases to initiate RNA synthesis, a similar \u201cprime and realign\u201d process likely occurs during replication (Garcin et al., 1995). However, the exact mechanism and viral proteins through which CCHFV removes protruding 5\u2032-ppp from its genome ends is currently unknown (Habjan et al., 2008).",

Moreover, while HTNV replication was efficient in RIG-I knock-down A549 alveolar epithelial cells, it was strongly inhibited by transient overexpression of RIG-I in Huh7.5 cells that do not constitutively express this helicase (Lee et al., 2011). It is not surprising that also pathogenic hantaviruses display a redundant Hit strategy to target components along the RLRs pathway. The ectopic expression of the hantaviral glycoprotein Gn, from the pathogenic New York-1 virus (NY-1V), was reported to inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation as well as IRF-3-directed transcriptional response of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Alff et al., 2006). Subsequent studies showed that such IFN antagonism is related to a 142-residue cytoplasmic Gn tail that is able to sequester the TRAF3 adaptor by binding to its N-terminal region, and that consequently inhibits the formation of a functional TBK1-TRAF3 complex (Alff et al., 2008).",

Notably, RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25\u03b1 stabilizes its interaction with MAVS and enhances downstream signaling (Gack et al., 2007, Gack et al., 2008). Similarly to ubiquitination, also K63-linked isopeptide-bond conjugation with ISG15 (ISGylation) of several target proteins is critical for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction and antiviral activity in response to RNA virus infection, showing both positive and negative regulation of the RLRs pathway (Zhao et al., 2013). For example, IRF-3 ISGylation prevents its degradation and is required for efficient translocation and permanence into the nucleus (Lu et al., 2006), while RIG-I ISGylation lowers its cellular levels to finely tune the antiviral response strength (Kim et al., 2008). Therefore, vOTU deconjugation of Ub and ISG15 from RLRs pathway components seems to be a Hit strategy by which CCHFV evades IFN-based immune response, however further investigations are required to precisely define both mechanism of action and target proteins.",

Moreover, in addition to such generalized downregulation of host cell gene expression (Billecocq et al., 2004), the RVFV NSs was shown to directly target the IFN-\u03b2 production. In fact, by recruiting the repressor protein SAP30, NSs forms with it a multiprotein complex on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, thereby inhibiting its induction (Le May et al., 2008). Recently, also the NSs of SFSTV, together with its N protein, were found to act as IFN-antagonists, as revealed by reporter gene assays that showed suppression of IFN-\u03b2 and NF-kB promoters activity in response to polyI:C and IAV infection (Qu et al., 2012). However, while the mechanism by which blockage of IFN production is achieved by both of these proteins is currently unknown, it is likely that inhibition would be exerted by SFSTV NSs through a yet-to-be-determined Hit strategy, as it was found able to co-precipitate with TBK-1 (Qu et al., 2012).",

In line with this, electron tomography studies have revealed that SARS-CoV infection alters the cytoplasmic membrane architecture by inducing the formation of a series of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) which, interconnecting to each other without communicating with the cytosol, converge to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (Knoops et al., 2008). Membrane convolution into DMVs seems to be directed by the SARS-CoV nsp4 protein, as its mutation results in aberrant and open vesicles (Clementz et al., 2008). Furthermore, nsp3, nsp5 and nsp8 proteins, forming SARS-CoV replicase, as well as SARS-CoV genomic RNA all localize inside the DMVs, suggesting that viral RNA synthesis likely occurs at these intracellular sites (Snijder et al., 2006, Stertz et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Notably, such extensive membrane re-arrangment, with DMV formation and co-localization with dsRNA was also observed in Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV, (de Wilde et al., 2013). Hence, despite the substantial amount of dsRNA byproducts generated during SARS-CoV replication cycle (Weber et al., 2006), it is likely that dsRNA shielding through its segregation into DMVs microenvironment is a Hide strategy through which CoVs effectively elude dsRNA detection (Knoops et al., 2008). However, such a passive mechanism is not exclusive, since the SARS-CoV N, a 46 kDa highly basic protein with a primary function of encapsidating the viral genome, has recently been found to target RLRs activation and signaling (Lu X. et al., 2011). The SARS-CoV N protein inhibits IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production induced by both SeV and polyI:C (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2011) whereas, by contrast, it is not able to suppress type I IFN induction upon overexpression of components such as RIG-I-CARD, MAVS, TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5, suggesting that the N protein blocks the initial step of dsRNA recognition by RLRs (Lu X. et al., 2011). In addition, co-IP experiments have shown that the SARS-CoV N protein does not interact with either RIG-I or MDA5, thereby excluding the possibility that such a block is exerted by directly impairing RLRs function (Lu X. et al., 2011). SARS-CoV N has been reported to be an RNA-binding protein (Chang et al., 2009, Tang et al., 2005) through both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Chang et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2007). Therefore, it is likely that SARS-CoV N binds dsRNA to prevent RIG-I and MDA5 activation and subsequent type I IFN induction (Lu X. et al., 2011).",

Primarily placed in the context of viral RNA synthesis, this nsp14 activity has been related to nucleotide misincorporation repair (i.e. proofreading) putatively exerted by the SARS-CoV polymerase complex. However, it is possible that this function is also related to the IFN-response evasion. In fact, as observed for the LASFV NP, such 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease activity may serve for nsp14 degradation of dsRNA intermediates, thereby leading to inhibition of IFN induction (Bouvet et al., 2012).

Several SARS-CoV encoded proteins have been found to display such properties, but the mechanism of action remains to be elucidated for most of them. The SARS-CoV ORF3b and ORF6 proteins are involved in suppressing IFN induction at the level of RLR signaling with their downstream adaptors. In fact, preferential localization and redistribution at the mitochondrial outer membrane of both ORF3b and ORF6 has been reported, seemingly associated with inhibition of RIG-I and MDA5 recruitment of MAVS (Freundt et al., 2009, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). Another SARS-CoV-encoded IFN antagonist protein is the structural glycosylated M protein, essential for the assembly of viral particles. SARS-CoV M exerts a double Hit strategy that results in the failure of IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation. First, SARS-CoV M interacts with RIG-I and MAVS, sequestering and re-localizing them into discrete membrane compartments associated with the Golgi apparatus (Siu et al., 2009). Second, SARS-CoV M binds TRAF3 and, stably associating with it, abolishes the formation of a functional complex with the TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5 kinases (Siu et al., 2009). Similarly, the papain-like protease (PLP) domain contained within the SARS-CoV nsp3 protein, an essential component of the viral replicase complex, interacts with the adaptor STING, impeding its dimerization and activation and disabling the STING essential function of MAVS recruiter to the TBK1-IKK-\u03b5 complex for IRF-3 phosphorylation (Devaraj et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2012). Furthermore, a redundant inhibiting effect on RLR signaling is also due to the deubiquitinating activity of SARS-CoV PLP, that has been found to remove Ub from several RLR pathway components, such as RIG-I, STING, TBK1 and IRF-3 (Clementz et al., 2010, Frieman et al., 2009).",

Indeed, although the RBD/IID is sufficient by itself to display an anti-IFN phenotype, a full-length VP35 capable of homo-oligomerization is required for fully efficient IFN inhibition (Leung et al., 2009, Reid et al., 2005). EBOV VP35 was found to be able to interact with dsRNA (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006), binding to both blunt-ended (Feng et al., 2007, Kimberlin et al., 2010, Zinzula et al., 2009) and 5\u2032-ppp dsRNA molecules (Leung et al., 2010b, Zinzula et al., 2012) with very high affinity and in a sequence-independent manner. Notably, residues within the CBP critical for dsRNA binding such as R305, K309, R312 and K339 were found to be important for IFN inhibition, since their substitution with alanine decreased dsRNA binding to different extents (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006, Zinzula et al., 2012) and led to failure in suppressing both ISG56 and IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by various stimuli (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006, Hartman et al., 2004, Hartman et al., 2006). In particular, with respect to wt VP35, R312A VP35 showed the most dramatic defects, eliciting different ISGs expression profile in infected cells, and EBOV containing R312A VP35 mutation showed delayed viral growth and attenuation of infectivity in mice (Hartman et al., 2008a, Hartman et al., 2008b). A similar defective phenotype was also generated by the double mutation K319A/R322A, causing total loss of VP35\u2032s dsRNA binding activity, abolishing IFN inhibition and rendering the corresponding mutant EBOV avirulent in guinea pigs (Prins et al., 2010). Notably, this double mutant was immunogenic and protected animals from subsequent challenge with wt EBOV (Prins et al., 2010), strongly reinforcing the notion of a correlation between VP35 dsRNA binding, inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and the pathogenicity of filoviruses.",

            "text": "The molecular details of the VP35 interaction with dsRNA have been solved by four crystallographic structures: two EBOV VP35 RBD/IID from the Zaire and Reston viruses bound to 8 and 18 bp blunt-ended dsRNA molecules, respectively (Kimberlin et al., 2010, Leung et al., 2010b), and two crystallographic structures of the MARV VP35 RBD/IID bound to 12 and 18 bp blunt-ended dsRNA, respectively (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012). As observed in these crystals, EBOV VP35s form an asymmetric dimer at each of the dsRNA ends (Fig. 7\nA). One monomer, termed the backbone binding RBD/IID, binds to the sugar-phosphate backbone of both dsRNA strands, while the second monomer, referred to as end-capping, binds to dsRNA terminal bases and the proximal phosphate backbone. As a result of this bimodal strategy, VP35 RBD/IID dimers mimic the RLRs shape and hide their recognition site at dsRNA ends, possibly accommodating the 5\u2032-ppp hindrance into a positively-charged pocket (Leung et al., 2010b, Kimberlin et al., 2010). In contrast, MARV VP35 RBDs/IIDs have been reported to helically coat dsRNA along its entire phosphate backbone, with a footprint of four monomers every 4\u20135 bp (Fig. 7B) (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012). Notably, even though in this case no VP35 RBDs/IIDs capping of the nucleic acid ends was observed, isothermal titration calorimetry and dot blot assays revealed that a binding event with a VP35:dsRNA stoichiometry of 1:1 almost disappears in the presence of dsRNA overhangs, thereby suggesting that an end-capping-like binding dsRNA blunt-ends modality may also take place for MARV VP35 (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012).",

As revealed by biochemical studies, EBOV VP35 RBDs/IIDs bind with similar affinities regardless of dsRNA length (Leung et al., 2010b, Kimberlin et al., 2010, Ramanan et al., 2012, Zinzula et al., 2012), while MARV RBD/IID binding affinity decreases as dsRNA shortens (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012). In addition, dsRNA overhangs presence is barely tolerated by EBOV VP35, for which a 5\u2032-ppp is otherwise important for binding to dsRNA with high affinity (Kimberlin et al., 2010, Leung et al., 2010b, Zinzula et al., 2012), while they do not affect MARV VP35 binding function (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012). Such different abilities to recognize diverse dsRNA PAMPs reflect the diverse properties of the two filoviral VP35 in antagonizing RLRs. In fact, while both EBOV and MARV VP35 were able to inhibit the dsRNA-induced ATPase activity of MDA5, only EBOV VP35 exerted the same effect on RIG-I for all tested dsRNA ligands (Leung et al., 2010b, Ramanan et al., 2012).",

Side chains of residues R305/294, K309/298, R312/301, K339/K328 in the Zaire/Reston EBOV VP35 CBP (Kimberlin et al., 2010, Leung et al., 2010b), as well as in the corresponding residues N261, Q263, R294, K298, S299, R301 and K328 in the MARV VP35 CBP, are all involved in direct interactions with the dsRNA phosphate backbone (Bale et al., 2012, Ramanan et al., 2012). In addition, residues R312/301, K319/308, R322/311 and K339/328 in the Zaire/Reston EBOV VP35 CBP are also involved in protein\u2013protein interactions at the RBD/IID dimer interface, while residues I340/329 and F239/228, in the end-capping monomer, interact with the adjacent K339/328, Q274/263 and I278/267 residues, which in turn bind dsRNA terminal bases (Kimberlin et al., 2010, Leung et al., 2010b). Most importantly, the proposed model for filoviral VP35 homo-oligomers shielding dsRNA PAMP signatures has been validated by mutagenesis studies, since alanine substitutions of the same residues resulted in a decrease or loss of dsRNA binding function, as well as in diminished or abolished inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation and IRF-3 phosphorylation (Bale et al., 2012, Kimberlin et al., 2010, Leung et al., 2010b, Ramanan et al., 2012). Hence, given the high degree of conservation of these amino acid residues among all known EBOV and MARV species, it is plausible that dsRNA sequestration by VP35 represents a key strategy through which these pathogens circumvent host innate immunity.",

In fact, both EBOV and MARV VP35 were shown to block IRF-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5 overexpression, but not to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation induced by a constitutively active form of IRF-3 (Prins et al., 2009, Ramanan et al., 2012). Consistent with a target upstream in the RLRs pathway, co-IP studies showed that EBOV VP35 interacts with the N-terminal domain of TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5, it decreases their catalytic activity and is phosphorylated by these kinases (Prins et al., 2009). In addition, overexpression of VP35 resulted in disruption of IKK-\u03b5 interactions with IRF-3, IRF-7 and MAVS (Prins et al., 2009). Therefore, filoviral VP35 targets the RLRs pathway also in a dsRNA binding-independent way by acting as alternative substrate for the TBK1-IKK-\u03b5 complex in place of IRF-3 and 7. Furthermore, these two IRFs are also directly targeted by VP35 that prevents their migration to the nucleus (Chang T.H. et al., 2009). In fact, EBOV VP35 was found to physically interact with both IRF-3 and 7 and to promote their Ub-like modification by the two members of the small Ub-like modifier cascade PIAS1 and Ubc9, thereby inhibiting the IRFs transcriptional function and subsequently suppressing the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Chang T.H. et al., 2009).",

Similarly, WNV is able to elude RIG-I recognition early post-infection (Fredericksen et al., 2004), although its RNA subgenomic fragments fold into secondary structures that have recently been shown to potently activate RIG-I (Shipley et al., 2012). Together, these data make it plausible that flavivirus counteraction of the type I IFN-response may include mechanisms that avoid dsRNA detection. Supporting this hypothesis, two studies based on 3D electron tomography have shown that DENV and WNV modify ER and Golgi apparatus morphology, inducing the formation of convoluted membranes (CMs) in the cytoplasm. Tightly associated with the viral NS4A protein, CMs invaginations wrap around other NS proteins that form the viral replication machinery which, as revealed by immuno-labeling, co-localizes into the CMs vesicles packed with dsRNA (Gillespie et al., 2010, Welsch et al., 2009). By providing a hidden compartment where RNA synthesis and virus budding take place, such membrane modifications represent a passive strategy by which DENV and WNV hide dsRNA from RLRs.",

In DENV infection, inhibition of SeV- or polyI:C-mediated transcriptional activity of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter was found to be dose-dependently related to the catalytic activity of the NS2B3 protease (Rodriguez-Madoz et al., 2010b). As recently demonstrated, this correlation is due to the cleavage of the STING protein (Aguirre et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2012) by a proteolytic core, within the last 40 amino acids of NS2 and the first 180 residues of NS3, which targets the consensus sequence LRRQ96G of STING, it eliminates its ability to interact with TBK1 and activates this kinase for IRF-3 phosphorylation (Aguirre et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2012). In WNV infection, a possible Hit strategy to block RLRs signaling has been identified based on the viral protein NS2. By using a WNV subgenomic replicon, severe inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven transcription was observed, and this phenotype was abolished by the occurrence of an adaptive alanine-to-proline substitution at position 30 of the NS2 protein (Liu et al., 2004). With respect to wt NS2 WNV, A30P NS2 mutant WNV led to faster production of higher IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 levels in infected cells and determined an attenuation of viral growth and neuro-invasiveness in mouse models (Liu et al., 2006). Furthermore, immunization of mice with this mutant WNV conferred protection against subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of a highly virulent WNV strain (Liu et al., 2006). These data reflect the importance of WNV NS2 as a determinant of virulence and pathogenesis, even though the exact mechanism by which this protein modulates IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression remains to be determined.",

Moreover, even though henipaviral V proteins do not directly bind RIG-I (Childs et al., 2009), their interaction with LGP2 induced the formation of a stable LGP2-RIG-I complex, rendering the latter unable to recognize 5\u2032-ppp dsRNA ligands (Childs et al., 2012).",

As revealed by mutagenesis studies, four residues in the zinc-coordinating domain, namely C194, C206, C208 and C211, as well as the two nearby conserved R409 and I414, are essential for the V protein\u2019s ability to suppress MDA5 functionality (Ramachandran and Horvath, 2010). Conversely, the single amino acids R806 of MDA5, R455 of LGP2 and L714 of RIG-I are sufficient for the interaction with the viral protein, as their point mutation renders these helicases unable to co-immunoprecipitate with overexpressed V in luciferase-based cell culture assays (Rodriguez and Horvath 2013). The MDA5 crystallographic structure in complex with the V protein of the henipavirus closely-related parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) was recently obtained (Fig. 6C) (Motz et al., 2013). As revealed by this structure, the zinc-finger \u03b2-hairpin located at the C-terminal domain of V is folded in a way that mimics the two \u03b2-strands in the MDA5 Hel2 domain (Motz et al., 2013). As a result, upon interaction with MDA5, V displaces the \u03b2-sheet motif of the Hel2 domain and accommodates its zinc-finger \u03b2-hairpin into the MDA5 fold, thereby causing the inhibition of MDA5 ATP-hydrolysis activity, dsRNA binding ability and oligomerization properties, which ultimately inhibits the MDA5-induced production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Motz et al., 2013, Wu and Hur, 2013).",

            "text": "The henipaviral W protein also downregulates type I IFN production, but the molecular mechanisms by which it targets the RLR pathway are less clear. In fact, the W protein was shown to potently block transcription from promoters activated by IRF-3, such as the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and the ISG54 promoters (Shaw et al., 2005). Moreover, since transcription starting at these IRF-3-responsive promoters was inhibited by henipaviral W also with concomitant overexpression of both TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5 kinases, it is conceivable that the target hit by this viral protein is placed downstream along the RLRs pathway (Shaw et al., 2005). Notably, due to a frameshift-extended ORF, W is about 43 amino acids longer than V, it lacks the domain responsible for interaction with RLRs and has a unique C-terminal basic stretch that functions as a nuclear localization signals (NLS) (Lo et al., 2009). Therefore, given that W is almost exclusively nuclear and that it does not block IRF-3 phosphorylation, it is likely that this protein directly hits the transcriptional factor once in the nucleus, possibly rendering IRF-3 dimers less stable in order to prevent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 promoter activation (Lo et al., 2009, Shaw et al., 2005). This mechanism of action would explain the ability of henipavirus W to impair both RLRs and TLR3 pathways, consistent with the hypothesis that it acts at a point in the pathways where the two signaling cascades converge (Lo et al., 2009, Shaw et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The notion that the multifunctional NS1 protein of IAVs is an IFN-antagonist derived from the finding that viruses deleted of its encoding gene (delNS1) showed attenuated growth and induced large amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in IFN-competent cells, but replicated well in IFN-deficient cells (Egorov et al., 1998, Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 1998). Subsequent studies showed that this phenotype was the result of a counteraction towards the RLR pathway, as abrogated virus- and dsRNA-induced activation of IRF-3, NF-kB and the ATF-2/c-Jun enhanceosome (Ludwig et al., 2002, Talon et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2000). Such inhibition was correlated with the ability of NS1 to bind dsRNA, since a binding-defective double mutant R38A/K41A NS1 led to virus attenuation in vivo and to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in cell cultures (Donelan et al., 2003, Talon et al., 2000). Notably, a third substitution at position 42 in the revertant NS1 mutant R38/K41A/S42G was reported to gain back IFN suppression capability but did not restore dsRNA binding, suggesting that, even though dsRNA binding is necessary and sufficient for efficient inhibition of IFN synthesis, it is not the sole function that mediate IFN antagonism by the IAV NS1 (Donelan et al., 2003). The impact of alternative mechanisms through which NS1 counteracts the host innate immune response (see below) was also highlighted by comparing NS1 proteins from different IAVs, which showed strain specificity in suppressing type I IFN and ISGs expression (Kochs et al., 2007). On the other hand, the importance of NS1 dsRNA-binding function for IFN antagonism was supported by the fact that the ability of RIG-I to detect IAV-derived RNAs was inhibited in the presence of NS1, but it was efficiently activated by the same PAMPs in cells infected with a virus lacking NS1 (Baum et al., 2010, Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Structural evidence indicates that NS1 exists as a homo-dimer and interacts with the phosphate backbone of dsRNA, so that the two RBD monomers lie on nucleic acid strands like parallel tracks on a slot (Chien et al., 2004, Liu et al., 1997, Wang et al., 1999). Along these tracks, several conserved basic and hydrophobic residues such as T5, P31, D34, R35, R38, K41, G45, R46 and T49 have been identified as critical for NS1 dsRNA-binding ability (Wang et al., 1999, Yin et al., 2007). In fact, as revealed by the crystal structures of the NS1 RBD in complex with a 21-bp dsRNA (Fig. 7C), these residues form a concave surface that recognizes the minor groove of the dsRNA A-form (Cheng et al., 2009). In particular, residues R38, S42 and T49 of each RBD, as well as arginines at positions 35 and 46 from different monomers, are involved in establishing key hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of both dsRNA strands (Cheng et al., 2009). Furthermore, an even more evocative description of how IAVs prevent the detection of dsRNA by RLRs has come from the solved structure of a full-length NS1 of the highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV in complex with dsRNA (Bornholdt and Prasad, 2008). As shown by a combined X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM approach, NS1 dimers multimerize through alternating interactions between the RBD and the C-terminal effector domain, forming a tubular structure with a central tunnel suitable to accommodate dsRNA (Bornholdt and Prasad, 2008). Again, critical orientation is observed for key residues such as R38, which is projected to the tunnel center in order to establish direct bonds with dsRNA, while other residues like K41 contribute to enwrap the phosphate backbone all along the entire nucleic acid length (Bornholdt and Prasad, 2008).",

Specifically, NS1 interacts with the coiled-coil domain of TRIM25\u03b1 and disrupts its homo-oligomerization, which is in turn indispensable for poly-ubiquitination of RIG-I (Gack et al., 2009). Moreover, the alanine substitution of E96 and E97 residues as well as the R38A/K41A mutation responsible for loss of dsRNA binding impaired NS1 interaction with TRIM25\u03b1 and caused attenuation of viral growth in vivo and increased IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Gack et al., 2009). Also, the TRIM25\u03b1-orthologue Riplet was recently found to be a target, in human cells, of NS1 from human IAV strains. However, while the E96A/E97A mutant was in this case still capable of such interaction, the dsRNA binding-defective R38A/K41A NS1 could not exert it (Rajsbaum et al., 2012). Finally, the NS1 proteins of most (but not all) IAVs are able to alter innate immune responses through a global restriction of host gene expression. To achieve this, NS1 binds the 30 kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation-specificity factor (CPSF30) (Nemeroff et al., 1998, Noah et al., 2003, Das et al., 2008), preventing polyadenylation of the 3\u2032 ends of host pre-mRNA, and interacts with the poly-(A)-binding protein II (PABPII), resulting in inhibition of host pre-mRNA nuclear export (Chen et al., 1999).",

The three RNA polymerase subunits PB1, PB2 and PA were all found to inhibit dsRNA-induced and RIG-I- or MDA5-mediated activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a gene reporter assay, and such inhibition was related to their binding to MAVS (Iwai et al., 2010). In PB2, whose inhibitory effect and binding ability were stronger, amino acids 1\u201337 were found to be critical for the interaction with the N-terminal 150 residues of MAVS, while an asparagine at position 9 in PB2 sequence was found to be essential for its mitochondrial localization and inhibition of the RLR pathway signaling (Graef et al., 2010, Patel et al., 2013). Regarding PB1-F2, this small protein encoded by a +1 ORF in the PB1 gene is found only in some IAVs and its presence is related to the high virulence in a strain-dependent manner (Schmolke et al., 2011, Varga and Palese, 2011). PB1-F2 strongly suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction, whereas infection with delPB1-F2 viruses results in increased IRF-3 activation and production of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA (Dudek et al., 2011). Initially, such activity was found to be mediated by a region spanning residues 39\u201387 of the PB1-F2 C-terminus, where a highly conserved sequence served as a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) (Gibbs et al., 2003, Varga et al., 2011, Yamada et al., 2004). More recently, the presence of a serine in place of the asparagine at position 66 within the PB1-F2 MTS was found to be related to a severe pathogenicity and a strong reduction of ISGs expression, and to be responsible for the increased virulence of the avian H5N1 and the 1918 Spanish flu IAV strains (Conenello et al., 2007, Conenello et al., 2011). In line with these data, the mechanism of action through which PB1-F2 shuts down type I IFN production has been elucidated by recent work demonstrating that PB1-F2 physically interacts with MAVS, and that the N66S mutation enhances this interaction (Varga et al., 2012). PB1-F2 also targets the transmembrane region of MAVS, dissipating the mitochondrion membrane potential that is an important factor for the recruitment of downstream components and the prosecution of the RLRs signaling cascade (Varga et al., 2012).",

Prompt detection of the pathogen, which relies on the recognition of its molecular components, is a prerequisite for IFN production, and dsRNA is the hallmark of virus presence, above all PAMPs. In the cytoplasm, dsRNA recognition is assigned to the RLRs. Viruses, in turn, circumvent this detection through an array of mechanisms aimed to suppress the RLR pathway. Within this array, we have described three main viral strategies, which are respectively directed to hide dsRNA from RLRs, to mask its presence by modifying its molecular features and to directly hit RLRs and their adaptors and/or effectors to impair their functions. These strategies, even though put in place through different molecular mechanisms, represent one aspect of the overall process by which adaptation between any given virus and the organism it infects was established. However, while the result of this coevolution and interplay is a fine modulation of the maintenance host\u2019s innate immune system, to circumvent its effects, spillover of the virus to a new host species may lead to new fortuitous interactions with diverse intracellular machineries, often causing the dramatic effects of an overwhelming infection.",

Moreover, in several cases, point mutations that impair their anti-IFN functions cause a loss of virus lethality. Together with the fact that the functional domains responsible for IFN antagonism are highly conserved within each viral group, this indicates that these viral proteins are attractive and promising targets for antiviral development. Additionally, given the importance of the RLRs pathway, it is also possible to envision the strategy of developing compounds that, mimicking the triggering power of dsRNA, may be able to boost the intrinsic innate immune system to obtain a preventive/aiding activation against viral infections. To this aim, tremendous advances in our knowledge are provided by the crystallographic structures of several viral IFN-antagonists as well as by the elucidation of their mechanism of action.",

In fact, assuming that viral proteins have evolved to finely tune the host innate antiviral response, rather than to completely suppress it, the understanding of the subtle differences between the innate immune antiviral response in humans and in these viruses\u2019 animal reservoirs will also be of paramount importance for the development of effective viral therapeutics, making it possible to shift the balance from a fatal outcome to the clearance of infection.",
