Historical evidence of pandemics and lessons learned from recent epidemics or epizootics caused by many pathogens (e.g., Ebola, Zika, and African Swine Fever viruses) illustrated the overarching need for close international cooperation. New and old technologies in vaccine development and their use were presented, resulting in a call for greater interaction between the human and the veterinary fields in order to leverage the expertise and knowledge in both human and animal medicine. The One Health concept was also emphasized for eliminating the 59,000 fatal human rabies cases annually attributed to unvaccinated dogs. For preventable, infectious diseases commonly spreading in the poorer regions of the world, a new regulatory approach and governance structure was called for to give access to affordable vaccines. Vaccines were touted as one of the most successful health invention ever introduced; on a similar level to health improvements due to clean water.",

Many new strategies for discovery and development of vaccines are employed in modern times, e.g., viral deletion mutants, replicating vectors, DNA-plasmids, and the use of improved adjuvants. However, several deadly diseases are still not covered by vaccines, e.g., HIV, where clinical trials fail because humans do not develop neutralizing antibodies except after long exposure to the virus or antigen. The impact of vaccination on human and animal health is hard to exaggerate and compares to the health improvements due to clean water.",

The antigen selection has been convoluted by the complex lifecycles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium species, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus with each having the ability to establish chronic, asymptomatic infection and presumably escaping immune detection for at least part of the cycle. The challenges inherent to translation from the laboratory to clinical trials during the development of any vaccine include the complexity of the manufacturing process and analytical methods in the early phase, and the clinical assay optimization and running of large clinical trials in the later phases.

The emergent coronavirus was used to illustrate the potential for rapid vaccine development. The viral sequence selection was conducted in just three days, the production and proof of immunogenicity was completed in just 38 days, and clinical trials were expected to start in March 2020. This was possible because multiple groups work together and because a lot of preexisting work on coronavirus is available in the scientific community. For an unknown emerging virus, this progress was estimated to take years and therefore basic research was emphasized to play a huge role in preparedness for emerging epidemics. Acceleration of development time and reduction of costs are paramount to future vaccinology for the global population. Structural biology is becoming more and more important e.g. in reverse vaccinology, engineered recombinant proteins, and Self-Amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines. Synthetic approaches to vaccine manufacturing have the potential to streamline development and enable rapid production of effective and safe vaccines. Pre-clinical proof of principle has been achieved for multiple SAM vaccines, which could radically simplify the way rationally-designed vaccine antigens are discovered, developed and manufactured [4] .",

Outbreaks are opportunities for philanthropic and public investments to create new governance systems with better decisions and not based on return of investment. However, when vaccines are developed in common with public bodies but licensed by a private company, the public institutions often lose influence on the final pricing, production facilities, and distribution areas. Medicines and vaccines are typically ordinary goods existing by the rules of the financial market; however, a new governance model should provide a new special status to tackle this topic particularly in poorer regions, because you cannot both maximize profit in medicines and have affordable medicines for all.",
