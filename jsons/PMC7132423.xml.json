The value of the network is in its breadth and the ability of users to assemble large communities with members from distant locales that would otherwise not be able to interact. In that sense, social media serves us like an international, all-access water cooler. Certainly, most readers are likely familiar with social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These websites allow posts within designated parameters that can be hosted and shared by user accounts. LinkedIn, Tumblr, and Snapchat (currently only a smartphone app) are additional platforms, and each outlet varies in its content, focus, ability to add images or links, and character limits.",

These communities include the targeted Clinical Microbiology Network (clinmicronet), which allows users (primarily doctoral-level scientists who are clinical microbiologists) to pose questions to the group at large, and respondents can self-select based on their expertise, time, and willingness. The American Society for Microbiology hosts clinmicronet and divC, a similar site for both doctoral- and non-doctoral-level clinical microbiologists). Reddit communities, known as subreddits, include r/microbiology and r/medlabprofessionals, among other science-oriented subreddits, and are used to pose questions, notifications, and observations related to their titles. However, these forums differ from above-mentioned platforms in that users do not maintain an active individual feed, access is exclusive rather than open, or both. This article focuses on social media that allow universal access and in which individual users curate a home page (also called a wall), as well as interact with other users.",

A 2016 Pew Research Study shows that 62% of American adults get news from social media, up from 49% in a 2012 study [1]. Subscribing to scientific journal feeds, society feeds, and science journalists provides up-to-date information on the latest conference, education, and research publication news. The active user posts his or her ideas, articles of interest, or responses to other users for a variety of reasons. The type of activity is often dictated in part by the format of the platform.",

Followers comment or ask questions about the scientific content of posts, and these questions are often answered by other fans. A popular Facebook post in 2016, titled \u201cAssessing Gram Stain Error Rates,\u201d promoted a blog about a Journal of Clinical Microbiology article [7] reporting a higher-than-expected error rate among clinical microbiology laboratories. The post was widely shared and commented on by microbiologists of all training levels. The topic popularity was in part due to the ubiquity of the technique among all levels of microbiologists, as students, technicians/technologists, and researchers are familiar with the protocol. This accessibility is important to engage a wide audience; introductory microbiology students are unlikely to be ASM members, but their experience with the Gram stain during laboratory courses allows them to feel part of the community.",

The lower engagement may be due to its smartphone-friendly interface. Users can access their accounts to view images on a computer, but posting photos is restricted to use of the Instagram app on one's smartphone. Additionally, Instagram does not convert hyperlinks, and normally, only a single link can be referenced in an account summary, making promotion of other websites using Instagram more cumbersome than Facebook.",

Addressing these popular public concerns may be a way to engage before providing important information on prevention and are also useful to prevent the spread of misinformation.",
