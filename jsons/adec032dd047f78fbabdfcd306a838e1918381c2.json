            "text": "1. The long-term ecological impact of pathogens on group-living, large mammal populations is largely unknown. We evaluated the impact of a pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus equi ruminatorum, and other key ecological factors on the dynamics of the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta population in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. 2. We compared key demographic parameters during two years when external signs of bacterial infection were prevalent ('outbreak') and periods of five years before and after the outbreak when such signs were absent or rare. We also tested for density dependence and calculated the basic reproductive rate R 0 of the bacterium. 3. During the five pre-outbreak years, the mean annual hyena mortality rate was 0AE088, and annual population growth was relatively high (13AE6%). During the outbreak, mortality increased by 78% to a rate of 0AE156, resulting in an annual population decline of 4AE3%. After the outbreak, population size increased moderately (5AE1%) during the first three post-outbreak years before resuming a growth similar to pre-outbreak levels (13AE9%). We found no evidence that these demographic changes were driven by density dependence or other ecological factors. 4. Most hyenas showed signs of infection when prey abundance in their territory was low. During the outbreak, mortality increased among adult males and yearlings, but not among adult femalesthe socially dominant group members. These results suggest that infection and mortality were modulated by factors linked to low social status and poor nutrition. During the outbreak, we estimated R 0 for the bacterium to be 2AE7, indicating relatively fast transmission. 5. Our results suggest that the short-term 'top-down' impact of S. equi ruminatorum during the outbreak was driven by 'bottom-up' effects on nutritionally disadvantaged age-sex classes, whereas the longer-term post-outbreak reduction in population growth was caused by poor survival of juveniles during the outbreak and subsequent poor recruitment of breeding females. These results suggest synergistic effects of 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' processes on host population dynamics.",

Infection may lead to rapid death, reduced survival and a nutritionally demanding immune response that could reduce host fecundity (Hudson, Dobson & Newborn 1998; Burthe et al. 2008) . These effects may prevail throughout a population or affect specific categories of hosts in terms of age, sex or social status (Sapolsky 2005; Sahin & DePinho 2010) . A host's ability to mount an effective immune response to infection is likely to depend on its body condition (Beldomenico et al. 2008) . One important factor determining body condition is access to resources (Nelson & Demas 1996; Tompkins & Begon 1999 ) which will be modified by factors including resource abundance, intraand interspecific competition and, in most social species, social status (Tompkins & Begon 1999; Archie et al. 2006) .",

Thus, although pathogens can negatively impact host populations, their impact could be modulated by 'bottom-up' processes mediated by resource access. The extent of 'top-down' processes is expected to vary over time because of stochastic fluctuation in pathogen circulation, host immunity and host population structure and size (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Martin, Weil & Nelson 2008) . Furthermore, when pathogen-mediated mortality sufficiently reduces negative density dependence, thereby causing an increase in fecundity, pathogen-mediated mortality need not necessarily decrease host populations (Forchhammer & Asferg 2000; Begon, Townsend & Harper 2006) . A robust and comprehensive assessment of the demographic consequences of pathogens, including their ecological effects and impact on the viability of host populations (Jones et al. 2008) , is therefore preferably achieved through long-term monitoring of pathogens and their host populations.",

Prevalence of external signs of infection with this bacterium sharply increased between September 2002 and February 2003 (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2006; hereafter, 2002 and 2003 are termed 'outbreak years') , and 12AE5% of hyenas died within days of developing external signs (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2006) . Because it was proposed that pathological effects of Streptococcus equi increase with stressful conditions such as high host density and adverse environmental conditions (Timoney 1999; Robert et al. 2005) , we predicted that socially subordinate and nutritionally disadvantaged hyenas should be most susceptible to severe infection and death induced by this bacterium.",

The resident hyena population on the 250 km 2 floor of the Ngorongoro Crater in northern Tanzania was monitored between April 1996 and April 2010; it contained eight hyena clans at a mean density of 0AE9 adults per km 2 (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) . Cubs were reared in communal dens inside clan territories; thus, numerous cubs (mean = 5AE9 \u00b1 3AE5 cubs per den, n = 61 dens from eight clans during the outbreak years) rested together in underground burrows each day. The density of large herbivores on the Crater floor (80 individuals per km 2 ) is high compared with other ecosystems (Runyoro et al. 1995) . Large herbivores moved seasonally within the Crater, causing substantial changes in prey densities in clan territories (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) . When prey density in a territory was low, hyenas foraged outside their territory (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) . The Crater hyena population size in the 1960s was estimated at 469 individuals (Kruuk 1972) . At the start of our study, it had declined to 171 hyenas, most probably because vegetation changes mediated a reduction in the abundance of the main prey (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) . Several hundred domestic stock utilised the Crater floor for grazing and drinking throughout the year.",

Hyenas aged <12 months were classified as cubs, those between 12 and 24 months as yearlings and those \u2021 24 months as adults. Adult rank was based on the outcome of dyadic interactions using submissive responses (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) . Cubs and yearlings were assigned the rank of their mother. Clan and population sizes were determined annually on 1 January unless otherwise stated. Clan size was the total number of members, and population size was the total number of hyenas resident on the Crater floor. Possible density dependence was assessed using annual population sizes and methods refined by Dennis & Taper (1994) . The null hypothesis was that the population was undergoing stochastic exponential growth and included random walk as a special case; the alternative hypothesis was that the population was undergoing stochastic, discrete logistic growth, i.e. was subject to density dependence. Demonstrating density dependence is here equivalent to rejecting the null hypothesis of density independence. The distribution of the test statistic under both null and alternative hypothesis was obtained through parametric bootstrapping and tested with a likelihood ratio test (Dennis & Taper 1994) . Dennis & Taper (1994) showed that this method of assessing possible density dependence was superior to other methods in terms of both biological realism and statistical properties (power, avoiding excessive type I error). Application of this method showed no evidence of density dependence during the study period (see Results section). This permitted us to directly estimate the growth trajectory in the absence of disease outbreaks and compare it with the observed population growth.",

The proportion of hyenas observed to have died of infection of 12AE5% (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2006 ) was similar to the proportion of domestic horses that died of infection with Streptococcus equi equi of 8-10% (Sweeney et al. 1989) . After the outbreak, mortality rates declined to pre-outbreak levels and hyena population size once more increased. However, owing to the reduced survivorship of cubs and yearlings (Fig. 4) and the reduced number of yearling females surviving to reproductive age during the outbreak years (Fig. 3c) , population growth rates remained modest during 3 years after the outbreak before increasing to pre-outbreak rates (Fig. 2) . The population decline during the outbreak and the modest growth in the three following years resulted in a significant difference between observed and projected population growth in the absence of infection (Fig. 2) . Thus, the outbreak of S. equi ruminatorum infection had substantial long-term consequences for the dynamics of the hyena population.",

Thus, die-offs in Crater lions in 1997 and \u2044 or 2001 thought to be associated with outbreaks of CDV (Kissui & Packer 2004; Munson et al. 2008 ) might be expected to decrease hyena cub survival and hyena population size in 1997 and 2001 and decrease population growth in these years and the 2 years that followed because of subsequent low recruitment. Our results do not conform to these expectations, and we found no evidence that the Crater hyena popu-lation sustained a CDV outbreak in 1997 and \u2044 or 2001. Furthermore, clinical signs and pathologies caused by severe S. equi ruminatorum infection (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2006 ) are inconsistent with those described for CDV infection in hyenas (Haas et al. 1996) .",

Because females are socially dominant and have priority of access to food in their territory, they are likely to maintain a better nutritional and immune status than immigrant males. Recently independent yearlings are inexperienced at foraging and rarely undertook extraterritorial foraging excursions to escape periods of low prey abundance in their own territory. Adult males are the most subordinate class in hyena clans and usually feed only after adult females and their offspring have left a carcass (Kruuk 1972) , and although they frequently undertake extra-territorial foraging excursions (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2007) , they are subordinate to all territory owners during these excursions (Hofer & East 1993) . Our results suggest that adult females are less compromised by S. equi ruminatorum infection because of lower levels of nutritional stress than yearlings and adult males. As we currently know little about routes of transmission between hyenas and immune responses to contain infection, we cannot exclude the possibility of differences between these classes of hyenas in either exposure to loads of infectious particles or the efficacy of immune responses. A possible link between poor nutritional state and susceptibility to infections is supported by the fact that external signs Long-term impact of disease outbreak on a social carnivore population 43 appeared in hyenas when prey abundance in an infected individual's territory was low.",

Lower mortality in adult females is unlikely to be a consequence of reduced exposure to bacteria in prey because rank-related access to large carcasses results in adult females feeding first and therefore consuming more body parts commonly infected with S. equi ruminatorum such as tonsils, the throat, skin and digestive organs (Timoney 1999; Speck et al. 2008 ) than yearlings and adult males. This suggests that yearlings and adult males more rapidly succumbed to the disease and were thus less often observed with external signs than adult females.

Between 1996 and 2002, Crater hyena clan and population sizes increased by a factor of almost two (Fig. 2) . In hyenas, individual corticosteroid concentrations induced by social stress are elevated in large clans (Goymann et al. 2003) .

It is possible that by 2002, contact rates between hyenas, number of individuals shedding bacteria, and levels of stress were sufficient to precipitate an outbreak. There was no evidence that the outbreak was the result of an increase in consumption of zebras and buffaloes, two prey species in the Crater known to be infected with S. equi ruminatorum, because hyenas consumed zebras and buffaloes at similar rates and densities of zebras and buffaloes were similar during outbreak and nonoutbreak years.",

            "text": "Why was there no Streptococcus outbreak after 2004, when hyena population size exceeded pre-outbreak levels, causing similar or higher levels of nutritional challenge and social contact rates than during the outbreak? Disease outbreaks can be eliminated or prevented when there is sufficient immunity against the disease in a population. This 'critical percentage' of immunity can be calculated as 100(1 ) 1 \u2044 R 0 ) (Coleman & Dye 1996) . Using the estimated R 0 for S. equi ruminatorum of 2AE7 during the outbreak, the critical percentage of immune hyenas required to prevent another outbreak would be 63%. Several results suggest that many hyenas mounted a successful immune response to infection during the outbreak and that this herd immunity may have been sufficient to prevent further outbreaks before the end of the study. These include (i) a low prevalence of external signs and apparent lack of decrease in survivorship of hyenas exposed to individuals likely to be actively shedding bacteria, (ii) a lack of decrease in survivorship of individuals that cleared signs of infection, (iii) a reduction in the severity of signs expressed by hyenas after the outbreak years and (iv) the fact that only one of the 14 hyenas surviving symptomatic infection expressed external signs on other occasions.",

            "text": "Increased levels of immunity may decrease pathogen virulence in at least two ways. First, a primed immune system will more speedily tackle invading bacteria. Frequent exposure to the bacterium and consistently high rates of transmission can stimulate high levels of immunity within host populations, thereby reducing the number of susceptible individuals (Anderson & May 1985) and limiting the impact of a pathogen on a host population (Guiserix et al. 2007 ). The estimates of R 0 suggest that during the outbreak, the bacterium could potentially be transmitted within each clan without transmission from other clans, populations or species. Owing to the highly social nature of hyenas, there is extensive contact between clan members, often involving transfer of body fluids such as saliva, nasal discharge, wound secretion or bacterial particles expelled during coughing. Furthermore, when feeding, particularly when consuming bones, hyenas extensively salivate, and at large carcasses many hyenas, including members of other clans (Ho\u00a8ner et al. 2005) , that gather to feed. Streptococcus equi can persist for prolonged periods on substrates such as wood (up to 3 days under natural conditions in temperate environments; Weese, Jarlot & Morley 2008) and be transmitted indirectly via contaminated water or food (Reif 1979; Timoney 1999) . If S. equi ruminatorum is present in saliva and can persist in water or carcasses of infected prey or hyenas, social interactions and feeding sites provide considerable potential for intraspecific transmission within and between clans and prolonged maintenance of, and immunity against, these bacteria. Furthermore, the carcasses of hyenas that died of infection would presumably hold high levels of bacterial particles that would be transmitted to hyenas scavenging from such carcasses.",

Previously, we demonstrated that zebras have a high prevalence of apparently nonsymptomatic infection and that direct transmission of S. equi ruminatorum is likely to occur from zebras to hyenas (Speck et al. 2008 ). More recently we discovered that buffaloes in the Crater, wild dogs in an area northwest of the Crater and camels Camelus dromedarius kept by Maasai are infected with similar strains (Goller et al. 2010; O.P. Ho\u00a8ner, B. Wachter, S. Speck, M. Grobbel, unpublished data) . However, because sequence data for S. equi ruminatorum are only available from one virulent hyena strain, it is difficult to establish the source of infection among the Crater hyenas, and whether the lack of additional outbreaks was because of increased immunity or decreased pathogen virulence.",
