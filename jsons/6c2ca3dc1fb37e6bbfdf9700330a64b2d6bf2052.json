With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) initial focus on bioterrorism preparedness at the state and local level in 1999 and the subsequent anthrax outbreak of 2001, the public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. Earlier detection, both intuitively and as illustrated through predictive mathematical models, is believed to save lives, prevent morbidity and preserve resources (Kaufman et al., 1997) . Biosurveillance systems use healthrelated data that generally precede diagnoses and that signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response .",

Electronic emergency department (ED) records are a major source of data for biosurveillance systems because these data are timely, population-based and widely available in electronic form (Lober et al., 2002; Teich et al., 2002) . There are more than 115 million ED visits annually in the United States, and EDs represent the only universally accessible source of outpatient healthcare that is available 24 h a day, 7 days a week (Nawar et al., 2007) . EDs see patients from all age groups and socioeconomic classes. Patients may present with early, nonspecific symptoms or with advanced disease. The accessibility of EDs provides a likely healthcare setting for many of the patients involved in a disease outbreak of public health significance. In recent years, EDs have steadily adopted electronic medical records technology , which has facilitated the replacement of drop-in manual surveillance using ED data with ongoing, real-time surveillance. ED data have been shown to detect outbreaks 1-2 weeks earlier than traditional public health reporting channels Lober et al., 2002; Tsui et al., 2001; Wagner et al., 2004) .",

The most widely used ED data element is the chief complaint because it is recorded electronically by most EDs and may precede entry of a diagnosis or transcription of physician notes by days or weeks . The triage note increases the amount of data available, which makes it more likely that biosurveillance algorithms will detect disease outbreaks. Triage notes are becoming more available in electronic form, and one study found that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of outbreak detection .",

Many EDs still document patient symptoms manually; even when the data are electronic, they are often entered in free text form instead of using standardized terms. Timeliness is also a concern; while some ED data elements are entered into electronic systems at the start of the ED visit, other elements are added hours, days or even weeks later. Even though there is no formal standard or best practices dictating how soon data should be available after an ED visit or other health system encounter for early detection, most surveillance systems aim for near real-time data, available within hours.",

NC DETECT has since grown to incorporate ED visit data from 98% of 24/7 acute care hospital EDs in the state of North Carolina and has developed and implemented many innovative surveillance tools, including the Emergency Medicine Text Processor (EMT-P) for ED chief complaint data and research-based syndrome definitions.

All EDs generate electronic ICD-9-CM diagnoses as they are required for billing purposes (NCIPC, 1997; . There is, however, some evidence that diagnosis data are not always available in a timely manner. In contrast to chief complaint data, which are generally entered into ED information systems by clinicians in real-time, ICD-9-CM diagnoses are often entered into the system by coders well after the ED visit. Sources of ICD-9-CM data may vary, which may influence the quality of the data. Traditionally, diagnoses have been assigned to ED visits by trained coders who are employed by the hospital and/or physician professional group. The primary purpose of the coding is billing, as opposed to secondary uses such as surveillance. Recently, emergency department information systems (EDIS) have come on the market that allow for diagnosis entry by clinicians. These systems typically include drop-down boxes with text that corresponds to ICD-9-CM codes; clinicians can then select a \"clinical impression\" at the end of the ED visit and the corresponding ICD-9-CM code becomes part of the EDIS data available for surveillance.",

Clinical case definitions are converted to syndrome definitions by expressing them in SQL, in most cases requiring both a syndrome specific and a constitutional keyword in either the chief complaint or triage note field. For example, a record containing the syndrome specific term \"cough\" and the constitutional term \"fever\" would match the respiratory syndrome. Documentation of a fever by vital sign measurement in the ED is also accepted in lieu of a constitutional keyword. The SQL code is written to identify common synonyms, acronyms, abbreviation, truncations, misspellings and negation in the free text data. The NC DETECT syndrome definitions have been modified over several years in an iterative fashion according to the knowledge and experience of the NC DETECT Syndrome Definition Workgroup. This workgroup meets monthly and includes public health epidemiologists who are regular users of NC DETECT for biosurveillance at the state and local levels, as well as clinicians and technical staff at NC DETECT. The continued improvement of the syndrome definitions for the purposes of syndromic surveillance requires more than this local effort, however.

These classifications were applied manually based on diagnosis or chief symptoms for each patient visit abstracted from daily ED logs. Based on these analyses, Hurricane Floyd resulted in increases in insect stings, dermatitis, diarrhea and mental health issues as well as hypothermia, dog bites and asthma.

In addition to timeliness, collecting ED data for influenza surveillance allows jurisdictions to assess impact on populations rather than samples, test case definition revisions on historical data, stratify ED visits by disposition type (admitted vs. discharged) and incorporate age stratification into analyses. The use of age groups in influenza surveillance has been shown to provide timely and representative information about the agespecific epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses (Olsen et al., 2007) . Several states and large metropolitan areas, along with North Carolina, transmit aggregate ED-based ILI counts by age group to an ISDS-sponsored proof-of-concept project called the Distributed Surveillance Taskforce for Real-time Influenza Burden Tracking (DiSTRIBuTE).

Symptom-based detection systems are often overly sensitive, resulting in many false positives that can drain limited resources (Baer et al., 2007; Heffernan et al., 2004) . Hospital and public health users who incorporate syndromic surveillance into their daily work flows, however, are able to accommodate these false positives more efficiently and still derive benefit from monitoring ED data for potential events. Investigating aberrations based on ED data that do not result in detecting an outbreak can still be important to confirm that nothing out of the ordinary is occurring. A recent investigation of gastrointestinal signals in Pitt County, North Carolina, for example, resulted in more active surveillance by the health department (checking non-ED data sources for similar trends) and the hospital (increased stool testing), as well as a health department press release promoting advice for preventing foodborne illnesses. Although a true outbreak or signal causative agent was not detected, this work results in improved coordination and communication among the hospital, healthcare providers and health department, which will make collaboration more efficient in any future large scale response efforts.",
