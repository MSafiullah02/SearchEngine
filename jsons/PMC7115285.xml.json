The virus loading concentration used in the current study is approximately 100-times higher than the loading concentration resulting from the highest contamination level estimated by Fisher et al.23 Maximizing the loading concentration is important for laboratory studies in order to generate a measurable log reduction and overcome the virus loss resulting from variable extraction efficiencies of different materials, potential loss of viability due to environmental exposure, and the detection limit of the log-based viable assay (~0.50 TCID50).",

            "text": "Compared with the Heimbuch et al19 2011 study that evaluated 6 FFR models, the current study provides a broader view of the diversity among FFR models currently available on the market. Across the 15 FFR models evaluated for this study there are considerable differences in FFR facepiece design, varying in overall shape (eg, cup, flat-fold, or pouch), material composition, and other design features (eg, pleats and flaps). Variability in design between FFR models has the potential to influence the effectiveness of FFR-DR strategies, making it important to understand which design attributes may be less or more advantageous for a given decontamination method. Reductions in virus viability \u22653 log were considered significant because a 3-log reduction would be required to fully disinfect an FFR contaminated with the highest level of influenza contamination predicted by the Fisher et al23 model. Significant reductions in influenza viability were observed on both mucin- and sebum-soiled facepieces for 12 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment. The 3 remaining FFR models\u2014Gerson 1730 (Louis M. Gerson Co, Inc, Middleboro, MA), Sperian HC-NB095 (Honeywell Safety Products USA, Smithfield, RI), and U.S. Safety AD2N95A\u2014still demonstrated statistically significant reductions in virus viability. The facepieces from these 3 FFR models are relatively similar in appearance\u2014white, cup-shaped, with slightly rough texture. The Gerson 1730 and U.S. Safety AD2N95A facepieces both appear to be hydrophilic, as indicated by the immediate absorption of the liquid inocula, whereas the Sperian HC-NB095 appears to be hydrophobic. Absorption of the viral inoculum away from the surface could potentially limit the UVGI decontamination efficiency because UV light is primarily effective for surface decontamination. Although the Sperian HC-NB095 facepieces did not appear hydrophilic, the relatively low log reduction may be attributed to the presence of horizontal ridges across the front of the facepieces, which may have created small shadowing effects while the mask was exposed to UV light. In general, the presence of shadows indicates the blocking of UV light, thus inhibiting UVGI efficiency. Although the data demonstrate UVGI can be effective, additional research would be required to define how specific FFR design attributes may influence UVGI efficiency, either individually or in combination.",

Significant reductions in virus viability were observed for both mucin- and sebum-soiled straps from 7 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment, whereas 5 FFR models demonstrated <3-log reductions for both soiling agents. Of these 5 FFR models, 4 models\u20143M 1860, U.S. Safety AD2N95A, Moldex EZ 22, and Alpha Protech 695\u2014appear to have hydrophilic straps and thus absorption of the virus away from the surface could potentially limit UVGI effectiveness. As with FFR facepieces, shadowing during UVGI treatment could also influence the UVGI effectiveness on FFR straps. The presence of shadows are likely a greater concern for FFR straps than FFR facepieces due to their propensity to twist and orientation based on how much slack is available. Ultimately, FFR straps pose a logistic challenge for UVGI decontamination strategies. This is a significant finding because proper doffing techniques for FFRs require handling of the straps, increasing the likelihood of fomite transfer. Thus, FFRs with straps that are amenable to UVGI disinfection would be preferred. Unlike the facepiece component, straps could potentially be disinfected using a disinfecting wipe or similar approach, but determining the effectiveness of these methods would require additional research outside the scope of this study.",

UVGI effectiveness has been shown to correlate with soil load, decreasing in disinfection efficiency as the soil load increases.29 As previously mentioned, the levels of sebum and mucin buffer used were intentionally high to act as a worst-case scenario. Pochi and Strauss35 measured casual sebum levels of 51 male subjects with and without acne to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. They found that subjects with severe acne had a mean density of 0.18 \u00b1 0.08 mg/cm2 sebum on their face based on the samples taken. Compared with the sebum level of subjects with acne, the sebum challenge used in this study is approximately a 7-fold increase. For mucin buffer, 5 loadings were used for each influenza droplet to provide multilayered shielding against UVGI. Although the level of soiling agents used in this study may be considered excessive and thus a limitation, significant reductions in viable influenza were still observed for both soiling agents, indicating UVGI decontamination of influenza could be performed in the absence of cleaning.",

For the purposes of this study, only the exterior surface of the facemask was evaluated for UVGI effectiveness. If implemented in a hospital setting, a UVGI application would likely need to treat both the interior and exterior FFR surfaces, accounting for potential contamination resulting from either the environment or the user. Additionally, the soiling agents used were artificial and thus a difference in UVGI effectiveness between artificial and natural soiling agents could potentially occur. There was also some loss in viable virus between the inoculation and extraction of control samples. The source of this reduced fraction of viable virus could be attributed to natural decay of the virus or influenced by the material's extraction efficiency; the effect of either factor is unclear.",

If implemented, an FFR-DR strategy should not only be effective against the pathogen of concern while maintaining the respirator's performance specifications, but also must be compatible with HCW operations and logistics to be successful. This study demonstrates significant reductions in viable influenza under substantial soiling conditions after being exposed to ~1-minute UVGI treatment. UVGI-based FFR-DR would allow hospitals to treat FFRs in a quick and efficient manner, benefiting HCWs during a potential influenza pandemic. Follow-up research to better understand the effect of multiple UVGI cycles on N95 respirator durability and performance using the current study's conditions has also been performed and will be submitted for publication.

Building on the Heimbuch et al 2011 study,19 this study evaluated the decontamination efficiency of an optimized UVGI dose (1 J/cm2) delivered to an intact FFR contaminated with both H1N1 influenza and a soiling agent. Significant reductions in influenza viability (\u22653 log) were observed for both soiling conditions (artificial saliva and artificial skin oil) on UVGI-treated facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and UVGI-treated straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. Log reductions were considered significant based on the decontamination efficiency required to fully disinfect the highest level of influenza contamination on FFRs predicted by Fisher et al.23 For FFR-DR, FFR facepieces pose the greatest challenge for disinfection, whereas FFR straps can likely be disinfected through alternative means (eg, disinfecting wipes). Implementation of a UVGI method will likely require careful consideration of FFR material type and design. These data are critically important for regulators and hospitals to understand whether UVGI-based FFR-DR technologies are being considered for deployment in the event of an influenza pandemic. They also provide the basis for future design of new FFR models that are highly amenable to FFR-DR.",
