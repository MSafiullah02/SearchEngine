            "text": "Ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible post\u2010translational process initially discovered in proteasome mediated protein degradation [1]. Since then, it has become clear that ubiquitination plays a critical role in many key cellular processes, by means of a variety of mechanisms, from changing protein stability and modulating protein activity to promoting or disrupting protein\u2013protein interactions [2, 3]. The central player, ubiquitin (Ub), is a small (8.5 kDa) but evolutionarily conserved protein. Several proteins related to Ub in sequence and three\u2010dimensional structure have also been identified as Ub\u2010like proteins (UBLs), such as NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8), SUMO (small ubiquitin modifier), and ISG15, which are important for a diverse set of signaling pathways including nuclear transport, autophagy, and antiviral pathways [4]. In a highly coordinated multi\u2010step enzymatic cascade, ubiquitination covalently attaches one or more Ubs to internal lysine (Lys) residues or the N termini (rarely) of target proteins through the sequential actions of ubiquitin\u2010activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin\u2010conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) [5, 6, 7, 8] (Fig. 1\nA). First, E1 employs ATP to adenylate Ub to form a high\u2010energy thioester bond between the Ub C\u2010terminal carboxyl group and the thiol group of the E1 active site cysteine residue (E1\u223cUb). The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the cysteine residue of E2 enzymes through a similar thioester linkage (E2\u223cUb). Finally, the E3 ligases recruit charged E2 enzymes and facilitate specific transfer of Ub to protein substrates [9, 10]. Importantly, a family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyzes the cleavage of Ub from polypeptides to make it a reversible process and also contribute to Ub homeostasis [11].",

            "text": "E3 ligases can be further divided into the HECT (homologous to E6\u2010associated protein carboxy terminus) family, the RING (really interesting new gene) family, and the U\u2010box family [7]. The major difference among them is that the HECT E3 ligases form an intermediate thioester bond with Ub before linkage to substrate. In contrast, the RING and U\u2010box E3 ligases facilitate Ub transfer from E2 enzymes by an allosteric mechanism [10, 12]. E3 ligases can modify proteins by attachment of a single Ub to one (monoubiquitination) or more Lys residues (multi\u2010monoubiquitination) in a substrate [13, 14], or by sequential attachment of multiple Ub moieties (assembled through isopeptide bond formation between the C\u2010terminal Gly carboxylate and internal Lys side chains in Ub) to a Lys residue in the substrate to form Ub chains (polyubiquitination) [10]. Ub has seven Lys residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), all of which can potentially participate in chain formation, with K48 and K63 being the most common and intensively studied residues involved in polyubiquitination [6, 15]. Ub can also form linear chains by linking to the amine of the N\u2010terminal methionine (M1) [16].",

            "text": "Given the essential role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in regulating protein function, it was not surprising that dysfunction of UPS components is implicated in the occurrence of many human pathological disorders, including numerous cancers, cardiovascular diseases, viral diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders [5]. For example, HUWE1 (encoding a HECT E3 ligase) is highly expressed in lung, breast, and colorectal carcinomas [17, 18], mutational inactivation of E3 ligase BRCA1 causes breast cancer predisposition [19], and overexpression of MDM2 was observed in several types of cancer, as MDM2 promotes the degradation of p53 [20, 21]. Therefore, developing inhibitors to target specific components of the UPS is predicted to have significant therapeutic potential. This has been demonstrated by the clinical success of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (PS341/Velcade, Millennium Pharmaceuticals), the first drug targeting the UPS approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 for treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma [22, 23]. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid derivative (Fig. 2\nA) that is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin\u2010like activity of the 20S proteasome core particle [24]. It is also in clinical trials for follicular non\u2010Hodgkin's lymphoma (Phase III), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Phase II), and many other cancers [9]. Although one would assume that inhibition of the proteasome blocks a common step of the UPS and is therefore non\u2010specific, interestingly, Bortezomib showed selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells compared with normal cells, probably because cancer cells have much more proteasome workload as they may generate higher concentrations of aberrant proteins [25, 26]. An irreversible proteasome inhibitor structurally and mechanistically distinct from Bortezomib, Carfilzomib (PR\u2010171/Kyprolis, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Fig. 2A), was approved by FDA in 2012 for patients previously treated with Bortezomib and immunomodulatory compounds [27]. Carfilzomib can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cell lines and importantly, it is more potent and more selective than Bortezomib and therefore displays activity against Bortezomib\u2010resistant cancer cells and its cytotoxicity against RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cells is higher that that of Bortezomib [27, 28, 29, 30]. Efforts are ongoing to develop second\u2010generation proteasome inhibitors, and hopefully these may yield drugs displaying better potency and fewer side effects [5, 24, 27, 31]. Detailed review about proteasome inhibitors for their synthesis, pharmacology, and clinical treatment of multiple myeloma and other types of cancer have been published elsewhere and will not be discussed further [27, 29, 32].",

Many groups and companies are gearing up to search for small molecule inhibitors that selectively block certain steps of the UPS. The success of Bortezomib and Carfilzomib in anti\u2010cancer therapy suggests that the development of such compounds would be clinically important to target individual pathways and substrate proteins for therapeutic benefits. Such drugs should increase the effectiveness of the treatment and should also have fewer non\u2010specific side effects compared with general proteasome inhibitors. In this review, we illustrate recent progress in finding specific inhibitors for UPS components (Fig. 1B) that have been implicated in human diseases and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets. We then highlight the invention of Ub variant technology as a rapid means for generating tools to modulate UPS enzymes.",

Importantly, the compound did not demonstrate inhibitory activity against other thiol\u2010dependent enzymes, including several E2 enzymes [34]. However, PYR\u201041 can partially inhibit HECT E3 ligase activity in vitro, raising specificity concerns. The effects in cells treated with PYR\u201041 included inhibition of cytokine\u2010induced nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) activation, stabilization of p53 protein levels, induction of p53\u2010dependent transcription, and preferential killing of transformed cells with wild\u2010type (wt) p53 [34]. Interestingly, PYR\u201041 treatment causes increase of cellular sumoylation but neddylation levels stay the same [34]. The potential therapeutic value of targeting E1Ub is further underscored by the unexpected finding that the nitric oxide (NO)\u2010producing prodrug JS\u2010K (Fig. 2B) inhibited E1\u223cUb thioester formation through an interaction between NO and the E1Ub active\u2010site thiol [35]. Consistent with other E1Ub inhibitors, the downstream effects of JS\u2010K treatment included decreased levels of total ubiquitinated proteins and increased p53 expression.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the UBL protein NEDD8 was found to be required for activation of a large subfamily of more than 100 E3 ligases, the cullin\u2010RING ligases (CRLs) [36, 37, 38]. The NEDD8 protein shares \u223c60% sequence identity with Ub, and it also can be conjugated to proteins through a process initiated by a specific E1, NAE (NEDD8 activating enzyme). Therefore, inhibiting NAE would be more specific than inhibiting E1Ub, and many CRL substrates are important regulators for cancer cell growth and survival, including the cell cycle inhibitor p27 [39]. Inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway was recently demonstrated using a small\u2010molecule inhibitor, MLN4924 [40, 41]. MLN4924 (Fig. 2C) is an adenosine sulfamate analog that binds to the nucleotide\u2010binding pocket of the NEDD8 thioester of NAE and forms a covalent adduct that effectively depletes all neddlyation activity through substrate\u2010assisted inhibition, thereby driving all CRLs into inactive non\u2010neddylated forms [42]. As shown in mouse cancer models, MLN4924 appears to exert its effect by stabilizing CDT1, a DNA replication licensing factor and a substrate of the SCFskp2 and CRL4Cdt2 ligases, leading to DNA synthesis misregulation and apoptosis and senescence of proliferating cancer cells [43]. Preclinical data show high efficacy of MLN4924 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [44, 45], and the compound has entered phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma and non\u2010Hodgkins lymphoma. Notably, analogues of MLN4924 form similar adducts with other UBL proteins and inhibit their cognate E1 enzymes, including Ub and SUMO\u2010activating enzyme, indicating that \u201csubstrate\u2010assisted\u201d inhibition may prove useful for targeting other UBL pathways [42].",

In a high\u2010throughput screen for inhibition of p27 ubiquitination, the Sicheri group found a small molecule named CC0651 [57]. CC0651 (Fig. 2D) turns out to be a specific inhibitor for human CDC34 (Fig. 1B) but not for its homolog UBE2R2 or its yeast counterpart Cdc34. The inhibitor acts allosterically by binding to a pocket that is 19 \u00c5 away from the active site and induces a number of translocations of secondary structural elements in the enzyme (Fig. 3\nA). CC0651 and its closely related derivatives caused accumulation of p27 and cyclin E in cells and inhibited proliferation of human cancer cells. These findings suggest that it may be feasible to develop highly selective inhibitors for other E2 enzymes in a similar manner.",

            "text": "Stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53 is critical for cells to respond to stress and limit cancer development. MDM2 is a RING E3 ligase that has a crucial role in regulating the abundance of p53. Many tumors that retain wild type p53 show evidence of MDM2 overexpression [63, 64]. Thus, targeting MDM2 in these cancer cells is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy [65]. Nutlins (imidazoline derivatives developed by Roche) are the first group of small molecules that can interfere with the ability of MDM2 to mediate p53 ubiquitination [66]. Nutlin\u20102 (Fig. 2E) disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and p53 by binding directly to the p53\u2010binding site of MDM2 and thereby stabilize p53. Indeed, Nutlins induce p53\u2010dependent cell\u2010cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence in cancer cell lines. Importantly, Nutlins have a significant anti\u2010tumor effect as shown by growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts in mice, with no obvious toxicity to healthy tissues [66]. Nutlin 3A/R7112 (Fig. 3B) has advanced to clinical trials for solid tumors and leukemia given its favorable preclinical characteristics in terms of pharmacological properties and toxicity [9]. RITA (Fig. 2E) is another small molecule that was shown to regulate the interaction between MDM2 and p53 in a chemical screen designed to find compounds that specifically arrested growth of a p53\u2010positive cancer cell line [67]. Instead of binding MDM2, RITA probably binds the N\u2010terminus of p53, thereby inducing a conformational change that stabilizes the N\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helix and prevents the recognition of p53 by MDM2 [67]. Interestingly, RITA does not affect the transcriptional activity of p53, but rather, prevents p53 from interacting with other regulatory proteins, such as PARC (p53\u2010Associated Parkin\u2010like cytoplasmic protein) and p300, which can promote p53 polyubiquitination by MDM2 [68]. As with Nutlins, RITA induces apoptosis in human tumor cells with little effect on normal cells, and it slows down the growth of tumour xenografts in mice [67]. It will be interesting to test whether RITA and Nutlins can act synergistically to induce apoptosis in cancer cells [25]. Inhibitors of MDM2 E3 ligase activity were also reported to be able to promote p53 stabilization and activation [69, 70]. Further studies are required to determine whether these molecules will be useful in the treatment of human cancer.",

In a variety of cell lines, IAPs effectively suppress the enzymatic activity of caspases and therefore inhibit apoptosis mediated by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, including death receptor activation, ionizing radiation and viral infection [71]. The E3 ligase activity of IAPs is a key regulatory component in the apoptotic program since it mediates both autoubiquitination and degradation, and also, that of their substrates [71, 72]. Smac is a protein that interacts with the surface groove of the BIR3 domain of IAPs and prevents IAP inhibition of both initiator and effector caspases [73]. A small molecule mimic of Smac was found to bind to cellular IAPs and potently induce caspase activation and apoptosis in human cancer cells [74]. Further studies of Smac mimetic small molecules revealed that they induce the autoubiquitination and degradation of the IAPs, which then leads to the death of cancer cells by stimulating the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) pathway [75].",

The SCF complex is composed of a modular E3 core containing scaffold CUL1 and RING domain containing protein RBX1, and an ubiquitination substrate specificity module composed of SKP1 and a member of the F\u2010box family of proteins, many of which are overexpressed in many cancers and correlate with poor prognosis [55, 76, 77]. In the case of SCF complexes, inhibition of either the F\u2010box protein\u2013substrate interface or the recruitment of the F\u2010box protein to the SCF core are attractive strategies to selectively inhibit ubiquitination events [78]. SCFskp2 ubiquitinates p27 and targets it for proteasomal destruction, and decreased levels of p27 are a poor prognosis factor in many malignancies [79]. Researchers have identified a small molecule CpdA (Fig. 2F) that prevents the incorporation of Skp2 into the SCFskp2 complex, and thus induces G1/S cell cycle arrest by stabilizing p27 and other substrates. Importantly, CpdA sensitized multiple myeloma cells to Bortezomib and was active against both myeloid and lymphoblastoid leukemia cells derived from patients [80]. In addition, a recent study screened for inhibitors that selectively target the p27\u2010binding interface formed by Skp2\u2010Cks1. This approach yielded four compounds that stabilize the expression of p27 in different cancer cell lines and induce cell cycle arrest in G1 [81]. SCF\u03b2TrCP1 is a CRL E3 ligase that triggers the degradation of IkB\u03b1, the inhibitory component of the transcription factor NF\u2010kB, and inhibitors of SCF\u03b2TrCP1 may therefore have potential to prevent the polyubiquitination and degradation of IkB\u03b1 [82].",

Structural studies revealed that the inhibitor named SCF\u2010I2 (Fig. 2G) inserts between the \u03b2\u2010strands of the WD40 domain of Cdc4, which are remote from the substrate\u2010binding site (Fig. 3C). Binding of SCF\u2010I2 induces a series of conformational changes that distort the substrate\u2010binding pocket and impair binding and ubiquitination of its substrates, phosphorylated Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 and Far1 [83]. Thus, SCF\u2010I2 is one of the first allosteric inhibitors of an E3 ligase identified thus far and its discovery raises the possibility of a similar strategy for allosteric modulation of the WD40\u2010repeat class of proteins [84]. A small molecule that inhibits the SCFMet30, but not the closely related SCFCdc4, was recently identified in a chemical genetics screen in yeast for enhancers of rapamycin [85]. The compound SMER3 (Fig. 2H) bound to the F\u2010box protein Met30 and diminished its binding to Skp1 in vivo and thereby disrupted the assembly of a functional SCF complex and stabilized substrates such as Met4 [85]. Finally, the drug thalidomide, a sedative that causes birth effects, was identified as an inhibitor for cereblon (CRBN), a component of the CRL4DDB1 complex important for limb outgrowth and the expression of a fibroblast growth factor (FGF8) during embryonic development [86]. Collectively, these proof\u2010of\u2010principle studies demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining selective pharmacological inhibitors of SCF ligases, which will offer highly specific therapeutic approaches for a wide variety of malignancies.",

USP1 mRNA and protein levels were also increased in a subset of human osteosarcoma biopsy samples. Finally, USP1 knockdown in osteosarcoma cells causes cell\u2010cycle arrest and osteogenic differentiation. Interestingly, USP1 also deubiquitinates FANCD2, a central player in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, and is required for FANCD2 foci formation, release from chromatin, and essential function in DNA repair [110, 111]. USP1 is therefore a promising target for pharmacological intervention, as inhibiting its protease activity in malignant osteosarcoma should lead to reduced proliferative capacity, the potential to reverse its transformed phenotype, and defective DNA repair to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents. It should be noted that USP1 forms a stable complex with UAF1, which stimulates the catalytic activity of USP1 [112]. Recently cell active small\u2010molecule reversible inhibitors against USP1/UAF1 were identified (pimozide and GW7647, Fig. 2J) and they displayed selectivity against a number of DUBs, deSUMOylase, and cysteine proteases [113]. Further studies of the USP1/UAF1 inhibitors suggested that pimozide and GW7647 inhibit USP1/UAF1 by a non\u2010competitive mechanism and bind at a site other than the active site of USP1/UAF1 [113]. Importantly, the USP1 inhibitors act synergistically with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin to inhibit the proliferation of cisplatin\u2010resistant non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells [113]. However, further biochemical and genetic studies in osteosarcoma cells treated with USP1 inhibitors will be critical to assess their therapeutic potential [114].",

            "text": "USP7 is a key regulator of p53, as well as many other substrates that are involved in various cellular pathways [115]. As discussed above, the E3 ligase MDM2 binds and ubiquitinates p53 to regulate its cellular protein level and activity [116]. USP7 is a critical component of this pathway as it deubiquitinates and stabilizes both p53 and MDM2. As shown by the Gu group, partial reduction of USP7 levels in several human cell lines promotes decreased levels of both MDM2 and p53, yet total abolition of USP7 stabilizes p53 levels by decreasing MDM2 [117, 118]. This observation suggests that the absence of USP7 promotes MDM2 downregulation, which in turn eliminates the activity of MDM2 as the Ub ligase for p53. Hybrigenics has developed a cyano\u2010indenopyrazine derivative small molecule compound (HBX41, 108, Fig. 2K) that can inhibit USP7 activity in the submicromolar range but is not quite selective against a panel of cysteine proteases [119]. Further kinetics data indicate that HBX 41,108 is an uncompetitive reversible inhibitor and it allosterically modulates the catalytic reaction of USP7 [119]. Similar to RNAi\u2010mediated USP7 silencing in cancer cells, HBX41,108 treatments stabilized p53, activated transcription of a p53 target gene without inducing genotoxic stress, and inhibited cancer cell growth [119]. Very recently, other USP7 inhibitors have been developed and they will likely help characterize the potential for USP7 inhibitors in preclinical settings [120, 121]. For instance, Hybrigenics developed second\u2010generation irreversible USP7 inhibitors (Fig. 2K), which are capable of regulating USP7 substrates in cancer cells and recapitulate the USP7 knockdown phenotype [121]. Indeed, incubation of exponentially growing HCT116 cells with HBX 19,818 led to an increase in the levels of p53 and its target protein cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Most importantly, HBX19,818 binds selectively to the active site of USP7 and is much more specific than HBX41,108 [121]. Another selective USP7 inhibitor, P5091 (Fig. 2L), was able to induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells resistant to conventional and Bortezomib therapies [120].",

USP14 is one of three human DUBs, along with UCH37 and RPN11, which associate with the 19S regulatory particle of the multi\u2010subunit 26S proteasome [103]. The N\u2010terminal UBL domain of USP14 is required for its association with the proteasome and this association can stimulate its catalytic activity [122, 123]. USP14 is shown to inhibit the degradation of Ub\u2013protein conjugates both in vitro and in cells by trimming Ub chains on substrates [122]. Recently, a high\u2010throughput screen identified a selective reversible small\u2010molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human USP14. The compound IU1 (Fig. 2M) binds specifically to the activated form of USP14 (proteasome bound) and enhances the degradation of several proteasome substrates in cells, including some implicated in neurodegenerative disease (i.e., Tau and ataxin\u20103), suggesting a potential strategy to reduce the levels of misfolded and aggregated proteins in cells under proteotoxic stress [5, 122].",

In different USPs, Ub is bound in the same orientation and the isopeptide linkage is aligned in the active site. Interestingly, the interaction surface on each side is very large but binding is generally weak [127]. However, despite the common fold, the Ub\u2010binding sites of USP family members differ in sequence, and consequently exhibit significant topological variation. Importantly, this paradigm of weak interactions through large, diverse surfaces also extends to other Ub\u2010binding proteins in the UPS, including E2 enzymes [128], E3 ligases [129, 130] and Ub\u2010binding domains (UBDs) [131].",

The recombinant nature of Ubvs enables facile manipulations at the genetic level to adapt the proteins for different assays and applications. Ubvs directly target functional sites and act as potent and specific inhibitors or activators of catalytic function. Consequently, they can be used to assess directly the effects of active site inhibition for validation of UPS enzymes as drug targets for therapy of cancer and other diseases. Moreover, insights from structural studies may be applicable to the design of mechanism\u2010based therapeutic small molecule inhibitors.",

First, E1 employs ATP to adenylate Ub to form a high\u2010energy thioester bond between the Ub C\u2010terminal carboxyl group and the thiol group of the active site cysteine residue. The activated Ub is then transferred to the cysteine residue of an E2 enzyme through a thioester linkage. Finally, an E3 ligase recruits a charged E2 and helps transfer Ub to specific protein substrates to form mono\u2010 (not shown) or poly\u2010Ub chains, which will lead to different cellular responses, including signaling events or protein degradation through the proteasome. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the cleavage of Ub from polypeptides to reverse the ubiquitination process and to maintain Ub homeostasis.
