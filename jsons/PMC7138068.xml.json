Other zoonotic pathogens can spread efficiently between people once introduced from an animal reservoir, leading to localised outbreaks (eg, Ebola virus) or global spread (eg, pandemic influenza). Zoonoses made up most of the emerging infectious diseases identified in people in the past 70 years which, although relatively rare compared with endemic zoonoses, are a substantial threat to global health and have caused economic damage exceeding hundreds of billions of US dollars in the past 20 years.8, 9 Apart from the appearance of a pathogen for the first time in human beings, the distinction between endemic and emerging zoonoses can be viewed as temporal or geographical. An endemic disease in one location would be regarded as an emerging disease if it crossed from its natural reservoir and entered the human or animal populations in a new geographical area, or if an endemic pathogen evolved new traits that created an epidemic (eg, drug resistance).",

The emergence of zoonoses, both recent and historical, can be considered as a logical consequence of pathogen ecology and evolution, as microbes exploit new niches and adapt to new hosts. The underlying causes that create or provide access to these new niches seem to be mediated by human action in most cases, and include changes in land use, extraction of natural resources, animal production systems, modern transportation, antimicrobial drug use, and global trade. Although underlying ecological principles that shape how these pathogens survive and change have remained similar, people have changed the environment in which these principles operate. Domestication of animals, clearing of land for farming and grazing, and hunting of wildlife in new habitats, have resulted in zoonotic human infection with microorganisms that cause diseases such as rabies, echinococcosis, and the progenitors of measles and smallpox that had historically affected only animal populations through changes in contact and increased transmission opportunities from animals to people.10, 11, 12 As human societies have developed, each era of livestock revolution presented new health challenges and new opportunities for emergence of zoonotic pathogens.13\n",

Some of these zoonoses, such as HIV, have become established as substantial new human pathogens that circulate persistently without repeat animal-to-person transmission. SARS could have established, but was contained by rapid global response to its emergence;14 other zoonoses, such as Ebola virus and Nipah virus, have not become established because of local control efforts or their intrinsic inability to transmit efficiently between people. However, others such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is enzootic in rodents in many locations, cause sporadic and infrequent clusters of infections in human beings.15 In all cases, these emerging zoonoses are defined by their relatively recent appearance (or detection) in a population or, in some cases, an amplification of transmission that increases the incidence, prevalence, or geographical distribution of previously rare pathogens.15\n",

            "text": "Emergence of a zoonosis depends on several factors that often act simultaneously to change pathogen dynamics. The capacity of a pathogen to transmit or spread in a population is commonly quantified by the basic reproduction number, or R0 (panel 1\n). In addition to inherent properties of the pathogen, factors affecting emergence or spread include environmental factors or changes in land use, human population growth, changes to human behaviour or social structure, international travel or trade, microbial adaptation to drug or vaccine use or to new host species, and breakdown in public health infrastructure.17 With more than a billion international travellers every year, infected individuals could potentially spread zoonotic diseases anywhere in the world. Thus, with the emergence of new infectious diseases and the chronic presence of known zoonotic diseases in many low-income and middle-income countries that might or might not be adequately diagnosed or reported, zoonoses are increasingly relevant to the global medical community.Panel 1Basic reproduction number (R0)The ability of a pathogen to transmit in a population is commonly quantified by the basic reproduction number (R0), which can be described mathematically. Formally, R0 is the average number of secondary cases an infected individual can cause in a specific population in which all individuals are susceptible. If R0 is greater than 1, the number of cases caused by a pathogen will increase and cause an epidemic. By contrast, when R0 is less than 1, the number of cases will diminish and the pathogen will eventually become extinct. For many pathogens, R0 is correlated with density of susceptible hosts (and contacts between them), thus one way that a new zoonosis can fail to become endemic in people is if the human population is sparse. This straightforward relation between population density and the ability of new zoonoses to colonise people might underpin the emergence of a series of endemic diseases thousands of years ago (eg, the Egyptian plagues, smallpox, and rubella), when populations aggregated into towns or cities and thus reached the density at which R0 for person-to-person transmission of pathogens introduced from animals exceeded 1, or could exceed 1 by evolving person-specific adaptations.16\n",

            "text": "Understanding infectious diseases beyond the scale of individual clinical cases requires assessment of ecological and evolutionary perspectives. An epidemic is fundamentally an interaction between populations of two species, pathogen and host, and hence has formal similarities to predator\u2013prey and other consumer\u2013resource systems that ecologists have studied for decades. Multiyear cycles of immunising diseases such as measles have been understood by direct analogy to predator\u2013prey cycles, and are driven by alternating periods of predator population growth (when prey are abundant) and decline (when prey are depleted).18 Similarly, interactions between pathogen strains can be understood through assessment of principles of ecological competition: one recent study19 explained the striking diversity of pneumococcal serotypes, and the epidemiological effect of the polyvalent conjugate vaccine, by interpretation of components of the acquired immune response in terms of stabilising and fitness-equalising ecological mechanisms. Such parallels are intrinsic and pervade all aspects of infectious disease\u2014even the central epidemiological concept of R0 is borrowed from population ecology.20 Similarities apply to both macroparasites (helminths and arthropod ectoparasites) and microparasites (viruses, bacteria, and protozoa). One difference is that microparasites have short generation times and can be subject to strong selection pressures from host immunity, other organisms present in the microbiome, and antimicrobial drugs, all of which are key potential components of the ecosystem in which the microbes live. As a result, pathogen evolution can occur in very short timescales;21, 22 significant evolutionary changes can occur in the course of one epidemic or even during individual infections. A conspicuous example is the development of resistance in bacteria in response to antimicrobial therapy and, in a slightly longer timescale, the antigenic change in influenza viruses that results in the need for frequent updating of the influenza vaccine formulation.23\n",

The virus became established in domestic pig populations, amplifying viral transmission and leading to a large outbreak in human beings in 1998\u201399.26 More than 100 people died during this outbreak and more than 1 million pigs were killed to control the disease.",

A decrease in the abundance of a preferred animal host can cause an arthropod vector to shift feeding patterns to human beings, leading to a disease outbreak. For example, when rinderpest was first introduced to east Africa, cattle and wildebeest populations depleted rapidly and tsetse flies switched to feeding on people, causing a large epidemic of sleeping sickness.27 Environmental changes (including anthropogenic effects) might change the abundance of a wildlife reservoir host, increasing transmission within the reservoir and the risk of zoonotic transmission. El Ni\u00f1o events in 1991\u201392 and 1997\u201398 led to human hantavirus cases in the southwestern USA via an ecological cascade: increased precipitation caused vegetation growth, allowing rodent densities to rise, allowing an increase in hantavirus infections in rodents. This increase did not cause population declines in rodents because, like many wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, hantavirus causes mild or subclinical infections in this group. However, the increased prevalence in rodents increased the risk of infection in people.28\n",

This process has inherent advantages in terms of increased productivity, economies of scale, ease and efficiency of surveillance, and application of herd health. However, ecological risks of intensified production (eg, increased host density and contact rates, reduction of genetic diversity within populations, and selection of genetic stock for improved feed conversion rather than disease resistance) without effective disease-control practices, were shown by the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1. This form of avian influenza evolved from a less virulent strain in domestic poultry to become very virulent, probably as a result of increased mixing between flocks and species in an environment where biosecurity improvements have not kept pace with the rate of livestock intensification.44 The organism expanded its geographical range through various movement and marketing practices, contamination of inanimate objects and environments, and in some cases transmission back to migratory birds.44 More than 579 cases of H5N1 influenza in people have been reported globally, resulting in 341 deaths, and more than 230 million birds have been killed by the disease or culled in counter-epizootic measures. However, the virus continues to circulate in avian populations. More effective control of this disease in poultry, such as improved surveillance, prevention, and response programmes, could have prevented cases of disease in people and protected livelihoods.",

In turn, the use of these compounds would have resulted in selection for resistance in bacteria, and horizontal transfer via transposons and plasmids allowed these genes to spread rapidly through microbial populations and communities. Resistance is emerging today on the same evolutionary principles. Microbial populations are adapting subject to the same forces of competition and selection, but the current widespread use of antimicrobial agents in people far exceeds that of any time since their development as drugs.Panel 3Ecology of antimicrobial resistanceAntimicrobial-resistant bacteria occur in many wild mammals and birds in numerous geographical locations.57, 58, 59 Although such bacteria are expected to exist wherever they are exposed to antimicrobials naturally produced by bacteria, fungi, or plants, resistance noted in wildlife can also be a result of either transmission of resistant organisms from domestic animals or people, or anthropogenic contamination of the environment with antimicrobials or their metabolites. Analysis of genes conferring antimicrobial resistance from bacteria found in non-human primates, people, and livestock shows that resistant bacteria from non-human primates that live close to people and livestock are genetically more similar than are bacteria found in non-human primates from areas with little or no geographical overlap with people and livestock.60 The study also shows the natural occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and similarities in resistance patterns where wildlife, livestock, and people are in contact.Studies of antimicrobial resistance in faecal Escherichia coli from rodents on pig and poultry farms in the UK suggested that resistance patterns, and the genes encoding resistance, are much the same in both wildlife and livestock (Bennett M, unpublished). Another study showed different patterns of resistance in E coli in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), and cattle on dairy farms in the UK.61 Moreover, prevalence of vancomycin resistance in E coli between these two rodent species changes throughout the year.61, 62 This finding suggests that, whatever the original sources of resistant bacteria and genes, differences in the ecology of wildlife species (eg, their diet and physiology) produce selection pressure on the microbes, rather than differential exposure to anthropogenic antimicrobials or presence of different resistant strains in the environment.The dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in wildlife, both naturally occurring and arising from anthropogenic influences, are not well established. Long-term multicentre studies could provide an improved understanding of natural variation, changes with time, and interspecies transfer. In addition to observational studies, experimental work with wildlife could provide valuable insights to understanding of population and community effects of antimicrobial use and persistence of changes.",

Substantial reductions in levels of resistant strains have been shown after termination of drug use,67 although persistence has been noted.72 Thus, reversion to drug susceptibility probably depends on occurrence of natural dilution of microbial populations with susceptible strains and fitness costs of resistance.72\n",

What is far less broadly appreciated is that none of the approaches commonly used to search for potential new human pathogens\u2014such as tracing back the source host of a human disease\u2014probably would have identified simian immunodeficiency virus as a potential risk to man. Thus, bold new approaches are needed.73 According to estimates from the UN, the global population will be more than 9 billion by 2050, and more than half the global population already lives in urban areas. Changes to food production systems provide more food security for growing populations, but also change zoonotic disease risks in ways that challenge disease control. The effect of endemic zoonotic diseases results in an annually recurring burden to the health and livelihoods of people worldwide, but disproportionately burdens low-income and middle-income countries.2, 5 Costs of zoonotic diseases are not restricted to expenses of human or animal treatment and control efforts. The disruptions to commerce and society caused by disease outbreaks can account for a large share (and in some cases almost all) of the economic costs from disease. For example, SARS cost an estimated $30\u201350 billion despite causing illness in fewer than 9000 people.9\n",

It requires knowledge of animal and human medicine, ecology, sociology, microbial ecology, and evolution, and the underlying issues that drive increased transmission of pathogens in humans, wildlife, and livestock: an idea described as a One Health perspective.13, 40 Meeting the challenge will also require an understanding of how the environment is changing, and how these changes affect microbial dynamics across the system. Therefore, prevention and response to zoonotic diseases and elimination or mitigation of transmission routes to prevent their emergence will need multisectoral collaboration.5, 40 Because zoonoses affect developed and developing countries alike, and spread readily across national boundaries, mitigation and control needs collaboration between ministries of health, environment and agriculture, and intergovernmental agencies involved in health, trade, food production, and the environment. International disease-prevention efforts will be enhanced by the implementation of WHO's International Health Regulations, which allow for reporting of a broad range of human disease events, and through support of implementation of international standards for animal health and zoonoses produced by the World Organization for Animal Health, which includes reporting obligations for animal diseases including zoonoses. The need for improved veterinary services in many low-income and middle-income countries is implied by the gap in broad awareness of zoonotic diseases and their ability for detection and prevention in animals, and the ability to quantify and report their occurrences. Because disruptive effects to commerce and society can account for a large share of the economic costs of disease, integration of control strategies in animals into zoonotic disease control efforts might prove more cost effective than would control in people alone.74\n",

These disease ecology approaches might be particularly useful in driving advances in prediction of the emergence and spread of novel zoonoses.73 Understanding of the relation between environmental changes, wildlife population dynamics, and the dynamics of their microbes can be used to forecast risk of human infection with enzootic or endemic zoonoses (figure\n). All zoonoses have non-human reservoir hosts, and the dynamics of the pathogen in these hosts often determines the risk of outbreaks in people. This risk can vary with geography, seasons, or through multiyear cycles, and can depend on factors such as changes in land use, weather, climate, or environment. Investigations into the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their wildlife reservoir could act as an early warning system to better inform the risk of an outbreak in livestock or people, and reduce the number of cases of human disease. For example, satellite tracking of vegetation density correlates with breeding sites for the vector of Rift Valley fever, and has been used to successfully forecast cases of disease in human beings, and the necessity for vaccine supply.76 These approaches can be developed further to ultimately predict the risk of future disease emergence.73\n",
