Access is also essential to reduce poor antenatal and birthing outcomes.",

Maternal and HIV deaths not only remove many years of a parent's life but frequently leave children orphaned, with further resultant costs.

Transferring public health responses designed for European or east Asian populations may not be appropriate without considerable tailoring to local conditions. A broader modelling approach to COVID-19 is needed, incorporating accepted measures of disease burden rather than solely mortality, and including scenarios for collateral damage in other disease management.

The unequal age-weighting function as well as discounting of future life years applied in earlier DALY versions were excluded. 15 COVID-19 disease burden and excess HIV, malaria and maternal mortality were calculated by multiplying the DALYs lost for a single health event by the population incidence and deaths by age group. DALYs for COVID-19 are based on age-related mortality reported by Verity et al. from the China outbreak, applied to age structures of comparison countries with relatively high COPVID-19 burden (United States, China, Italy and Spain) and Iceland, 30 where testing rates have been relatively high. 23 For sake of comparison, a 20% total detectable infection rate was used.
