The early phase of the disease occurs from 1 to 7 days post-inoculation and involves a retinal vasculitis associated with the presence of infectious virus. The late phase of the disease begins at about day 10 post-inoculation and involves retinal degeneration associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed against the neuroretina and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Infectious virus, viral antigens, and inflammatory cells are absent during the late phase and virus-neutralizing antibodies are produced during both phases. When CD-1 mice are similarly inoculated, only the early phase of the disease is induced (Wang et al., 1996); antiviral antibodies are produced, but anti-retinal autoantibodies are not (Hooks et al., 1993).",

A marked upregulation of VEGF occurs in the inner retinas of rats developing experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) Luna et al., 1997, Vinores et al., 1998a. In these rats, there is inflammatory cell infiltration and an autoimmune reaction with blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown, but no angiogenesis. Experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) of murine retinas provides a model with inflammatory cell infiltration in the early phase and an autoimmune reaction in the late phase, when BALB/c mice are used. In CD-1 mice, the autoimmune response is absent; therefore, differences that may be observed in BRB breakdown and the presence and/or distribution of VEGF and its receptors, when comparing these two strains, are likely to relate to the development of retinal degenerative disease. This model will be used to determine at what phase BRB breakdown occurs, how extensive it is, and whether it is reversible. The immunohistochemical localization of extravasated albumin is an established method for visualizing the location and extent of sites of BRB breakdown Vinores, 1995, Vinores et al., 1989, Vinores et al., 1990b, Vinores et al., 1994, Vinores et al., 1995a, Vinores et al., 1995b and it will be used to assess the integrity of the BRB. This model can also provide information as to whether VEGF may play a role in one or both of these phases.",

This is also the time when apoptosis is occurring within the retina (Wang et al., 2000). In CD-1 mice, BRB breakdown also coincided with inflammation and both BRB dysfunction and leukocyte infiltration peaked during the acute phase of the infection (days 6\u20138). Albumin extravasation during the acute phase was greater in CD-1 mice than in BALB/c mice, which correlated with a greater extent of leukocyte infiltration in CD-1 mice during this phase. Following the acute phase of infection, there was a decrease in inflammatory cells and virus particles and the integrity of the BRB was restored. BRB breakdown that occurred in the late phase of the infection in BALB/c mice generally corresponded to structural damage related to retinal degenerative disease.",

The specific function of VEGF in the progression of EAU is unclear; however, the autoimmune disorder involves BRB breakdown and inflammatory cell infiltration, both of which can be promoted by VEGF. Likewise, with experimental herpesvirus retinopathy, which presents a unique model of a transient inflammatory response in the virus-injected eye and subsequent acute retinal necrosis associated with virus transmission to the opposite eye (Whittum et al., 1984), VEGF is upregulated in both eyes (Vinores et al., 1997a). In the herpesvirus-injected eye, VEGF upregulation coincides with inflammation, with its levels diminishing as the inflammation subsides. In the contralateral eye, VEGF induction coincides with the appearance of virus particles and the onset of inflammatory cell infiltration. In experimental coronavirus infection, VEGF upregulation did not appear to coincide with inflammatory cell infiltration and/or the presence of infective virus and no differences were noted in the extent or distribution of VEGF receptors through the course of the disease; therefore, VEGF may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental coronavirus retinopathy as it does in EAU and experimental herpesvirus retinopathy. The only significant upregulation of VEGF appears late in the course of the disease, when retinal degeneration is occurring, and may result from hypoxia related to the retinal degeneration, since VEGF is known to be induced under hypoxic conditions Shweiki et al., 1992, Plate et al., 1992, Goldberg and Schneider, 1994, Hashimoto et al., 1994, Minchenko et al., 1994a, Minchenko et al., 1994b, Levy et al., 1995, Pierce et al., 1995, Vinores et al., 1997b.",

Neovascularization also does not occur in ECOR, but without the upregulation of VEGF, an angiogenesis inhibitor may not be necessary to inhibit vascular growth.

In comparison to BALB/c mice, the CD-1 mouse BRB breakdown was more extensive and correlated with an enhanced inflammatory response. The findings indicate that BRB breakdown correlates directly with inflammatory cell infiltration and not with retinal degeneration in both sensitive and resistant strains. This study clearly demonstrates that although VEGF plays a basic role in the development of EAU and herpes simplex retinitis, it is not involved in the pathogenic processes in ECOR. Its upregulation, only in mice undergoing retinal degeneration (BALB/c mice after the acute inflammatory response), suggests that VEGF induction may be a secondary change related to retinal degeneration, rather than to inflammation or viral infection. Moreover, the lack of upregulation of VEGF in ECOR may be one of the factors which allows the CD-1 mouse retina to return to a normal appearance after the acute disease.",
