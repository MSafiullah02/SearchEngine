            "text": "The basic stock valuation model asserts that stock price is equal to the present value of expected future dividend payments, which is formulated as: (1)Pt=\u2211t=1\u221eDt(1+r)t,where Pt is the stock price at time t, Dt is the dividend payment at the end of time t, and r is the discount rate used to bring the future dividends to present value. Assuming that dividends are a linear function of earnings (E) and Dt=q\u00b7Et, where q is the constant payout ratio, we can write Eq. (1) as:(2)Pt=q\u00b7\u2211t=1\u221eEt(1+r)t.Eq. (2) demonstrates that stock prices reflect investors\u2019 expectations about future corporate earnings (Chaney, Devinney, & Winer, 1991; Choi, Hauser, & Kopekcy, 1999; McWilliams & Siegel, 1997). Since business conditions usually impact corporate earnings and dividends, it is often observed that stock prices tend to fluctuate with business conditions (Barro, 1990; Beckers, Grinold, Rudd, & Stefek, 1992; Chen, Roll, & Ross, 1986; Fama, 1981; Fama & French, 1988; Ferson & Harvey, 1993; Chen, 2005). The efficient markets theory further suggests that a firm's stock price should reflect its real-market value or true financial performance (Bodie, Alex, & Alan, 2001; Mishkin & Eakins, 2003). Thus, some interactions are expected to exist between business conditions and firm financial performance.",

A positive economic impact usually leads to an increase in sales and hence income (and earnings), which in turn can improve the performance of business firms. On the other hand, corporate earnings and dividends are most likely to decrease if business conditions are expected to deteriorate. This reduction in expected earnings and dividends will in turn cause a decrease in the stock price or the firm's performance (Harvey, 1991). Conversely, financial success of business firms can lift business conditions by generating job opportunities, business turnover, and government taxes (Jeon et al., 2004).",

Both Taiwanese IP and GDP data are taken from the TEJ database and Chinese IP and GDP data are obtained form various issues of the China statistical yearbook.

For example, after the Chinese Ministry of Health first reported that there had been 300 cases of SARS on February 11, 2003, the number of visitors to China decreased from 8,484,300 in January to 7,376,000 in February (a 6.08% drop), to 5,649,200 in April (a 17.66% drop since January), and to 5,436,000 in May (a total of 35.93% drop in four months). Chen (2006a) also reports that the SARS outbreak has a significantly negative impact on hotel stock returns in China. For the case of Taiwan, after the SARS outbreak on April 22, 2003, the number of visitors to Taiwan significantly dropped from 258,023 in March to 110,632 in April (a 57% drop) and to 40,250 in May (an 84% drop in 2 months). The China Post (2003) reported that the tourism-related industries such as hotels, restaurants, and theme parks were the most severely affected groups by the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan. The severe, negative impact of the SARS outbreak on the tourism industry was well reflected on its financial performance (stock prices). As shown in Fig. 5\n, the tourism industry, among all industries, experienced the highest monthly percentage drop in the share price index in the month after the SARS outbreak. Chen, Jang, & Kim (2006), Chen, Kim, & Kim (2005) further shows that SARS outbreak has much more damaging impact than any other non-macro events, such as the earthquake, wars, financial crisis, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. Moreover, Waugh (2003) estimates that Taiwanese economic growth in 2003 was cut by SARS by 0.5%. Given the finding that business expansion and financial success of tourism firms significantly reinforce each other in China and Taiwan, the local government authority should equally allocate resources to tourism and other major industries to enhance the tourism industry and the overall economy.",

The announcement was a momentous occasion for China. It is equivalently significant to China's inbound tourism industry. Over the years, Olympics host cities and countries have organized various forms of tourism promotion in association with the Games. The Games would have a significantly positive impact on the tourism industry and, consequently, on the overall business climate and the national economy. However, Chen (2006a) finds that the announcement of the 2008 Beijing Olympics has a negative impact on hotel stock returns in China. Thus, the Chinese government and tourism authorities need to cautiously prepare for the Games, instead of expecting that a beneficial influence of the Olympics on both the tourism industry and overall economy would just happen automatically.",

As they noted, the negative impact of the Sydney Olympics is understandable, considering the geographical distance between the two nations. They also argue that Taiwan could have benefited from the 2002 Japan/Korea World Cup because of its proximity to Japan and South Korea and conclude that the negative effect might be attributed to the lack of sufficient efforts made to attract international visitors. Because evidence shows that financial success of tourism firms and business development promote each other in Taiwan, both its government and private tourism organizations and marketers should strive to take advantage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics in China. For shopping lovers, Taiwan can be regarded as an excellent stopover destination because it provides various eatery choices and products. If enthusiastic tourism promotion or activities can attract international tourists to make a trip to Taiwan during the 2008 Olympics game period, the financial performance of tourism firms and the industry as a whole would be positively influenced, which in turn can boost the overall economy.",

However, it is worth noting that empirical findings in this study should be interpreted with caution since stock prices of tourism firms are only available over a limited time span, 7\u201310 years for the case of China and about 14 years for the case of Taiwan. More general conclusions can be drawn, if this research can be replicated with data from different countries.

Chen (2006a) finds that Chinese hotel stock returns are significantly associated with growth rates of industrial production, growth rates of imports, changes in discount rates, and changes in yield spread. In the future, tourism researchers can carry out the examination, using those economic factors.",
