Diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical, radiographic, and physiologic abnormalities including severe hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest-X-ray, and no clinical evidence of hydrostatic/cardiogenic pulmonary edema [1]. The estimated annual incidence of ARDS is 7 cases per 100,000 individuals, with an associated hospital mortality of 40% [2, 3]. Although there are different processes that can cause ARDS, such as pneumonia, severe trauma, or blood transfusions [4]; sepsis continues to be the main risk factor precipitating this syndrome in adults [5].",

In that study, the protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type F-interacting protein alpha-1 (PPFIA1) gene was identified as a novel ARDS locus, which encodes a protein implicated in cell-cell junctions and cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [12]. The authors first identified the most significant association signals in the discovery stage, and then, a replication was performed in independent samples. Finally, these signals were recognized by integration with gene expression data [12]. However, it is anticipated that many other ARDS loci remain to be identified. In the present study, we aimed to reassess the GWAS results published by Christie et al. [12] performing the integration with transcriptomic data from an animal model of ARDS. This approach allowed to prioritize candidate genes that were followed-up in independent replication studies in order to reveal novel sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility loci.",

            "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the overall scheme of the process involved in the selection of candidate genes. Gene prioritization began with transcriptomic data derived from an experimental animal model of ARDS, which was induced by abdominal sepsis after 24 h of cecal ligation and puncture, and subsequent challenge by mechanical ventilation (MV) strategies for 4 h [13] (ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-2673). Three experimental groups were compared based on the ventilatory approach applied: unventilated spontaneously breathing septic animals (SS), septic animals ventilated with protective MV (SPV), and septic animals ventilated with injurious MV (SIV). Total RNA was purified from total left lung tissue of surviving animals from each experimental group, which was used for hybridization of fragmented cRNA to the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Then, differential gene expression was identified using a multi-group comparison by means of MulCom test, revealing 2859 deregulated genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) \u2264 0.05 and fold change (FC) \u2265 1.7 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Differential contribution on biological processes of these genes was assessed by functional annotation clustering analyses using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 [14]. This analysis revealed Neuron projection morphogenesis as the key deregulated pathway (FDR = 1.76 \u00d7 10\u22123) (Additional file 2: Table S2). Later, in order to reveal other common mechanisms in the animal model, we performed a protein-protein interaction network with the EnrichNet tool using the overlapping deregulated genes from the multi-group comparison (Additional file 3: Table S3). While eight signaling interaction networks were significant in at least one of the groups, the signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) network was the only significantly deregulated across all three groups. Signaling by VEGF plays a central and broad role in endothelial cell function, and in several aspects of the immune and inflammatory response, usually linked to lung edema promotion [15]. Moreover, neuron projection morphogenesis shares important characteristics with signaling by VEGF, such as the interplay of similar angiogenic molecules, principles, and mechanisms implicated in the navigation through their targets and morphogens [16]. In fact, VEGF could be considered a prototypic angioneurin, comparable to semaphorins, netrins, slits, ephrins, and neuropilins [17].",

According to the information deposited in the dbGaP database, a total of 518,313 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina genotyping platform Human660W-Quad v1.0 in 2235 Western European descent individuals, including 1122 ARDS cases and 1113 at-risk controls (i.e., patients with pneumonia, trauma, and pancreatitis or those subjected to aspiration or massive blood transfusion but did not develop ARDS). We performed quality control procedures with PLINK v1.07 [28] to remove samples with missing clinical information and genotype call rates < 95%, leaving a total of 1119 cases and 1113 controls for further analyses. Additionally, those SNPs with a genotyping rate < 97% were excluded, leaving a total of 516,348 SNPs, none of which deviated from HWE (p value < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126). In addition, principal component analysis was performed with EIGENSOFT (v4.2) [29] analyzing ~ 100,000 independent SNPs extracted from this data. In order to retrieve the SNPs of interest, genotype imputation was performed with Minimac3 [30] using the Haplotype Reference Consortium version r1.1 data as reference panel [31] on the Michigan Imputation Server [32]. Association testing was conducted using logistic regression models with R including the first two principal components as covariates, showing a minimal inflation due to population stratification (Lambda = 1.036). To approximate as much as possible this study to that utilized in the discovery stage, the replication only considered as cases those patients with sepsis-associated ARDS (n = 661) and as controls those patients that were free from sepsis and ARDS (n = 234) (Fig. 2). Detailed demographic and clinical data from the subset of patients included in this stage can be found in Table 2.",

After correcting for the independent number of SNPs analyzed in each gene, four genes contained the largest proportion of significant SNPs normalized by number of variants analyzed per gene, namely dynein cytoplasmatic 2, heavy chain 1 (DYNC2H1), fms-related tyrosine kinase-1 (FLT1), integrin, alpha-1 (ITGA1), and peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6). For each of them, the most significant SNP, or a SNP in high LD with it, was chosen for genotyping. For DYNC2H1 and ITGA1, we selected the SNPs rs11225640 (p = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 with trauma-induced ARDS) and rs16880534 (p = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 with trauma-induced ARDS), respectively. However, for the FLT1 gene, the flanking region of the top-prioritized SNP (rs9508026, p = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 with trauma-induced ARDS) did not allow the design of a genotyping assay. Therefore, this top-associated SNP was captured by an alternative SNP (rs9513106) in strong LD (r2 = 0.8). Lastly, for PRDX6, we selected the variant rs9425722 (p = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 with trauma-induced ARDS).",

This result was consistent with the information found in the European population data from The 1000 Genomes Project [23], where this position is monomorphic. For this reason, and given that a previous study evaluated the common variants from the PRDX6 gene and found no association with ARDS [36], we disregarded this gene from further analyses. The other three SNPs selected for association studies had a genotype concordance rate > 98% among duplicated samples and a genotyping rate > 95% (Table 3), and none of the SNPs deviated significantly from the HWE in the population-based controls. Association testing of these three SNPs with the development of ARDS susceptibility (Additional file 6: Table 4) revealed a significant association for the FLT1 SNP (rs9513106), with an OR for the C allele of 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.58\u20130.98, p = 0.037).

            "text": "The FLT1 gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with an extracellular ligand-binding region with seven domains of immunoglobulin that belongs to the VEGF receptor family. Ligands of FLT1, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factors are critically involved in edema formation during ARDS [15]. After binding FLT1, they trigger intracellular signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, survival, and migration, as well as in the increase of endothelial cell permeability and angiogenesis [37]. Studies carried out in animal models support the implication of this pathway promoting vascular permeability [38], and functional assays in human vascular cells have shown that elevated expression of FLT1 gene was associated with decreased amounts of inflammatory adhesion molecules [39]. VEGF signaling is required for the maintenance of adult lung alveolar structures and reduced VEGF levels have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from ARDS patients [40\u201342], in contrast with the high VEGF levels found in BAL from healthy individuals [43]. Furthermore, oxidative stress, cytokines, and hypoxia are important factors that regulate VEGF expression [44], which are key players in ARDS development. Therefore, a positive feedback may exist between all or some of these factors to increase VEGF expression, and consequently, VEGF binding to its receptors may contribute to the promotion of increased vascular permeability and a higher degree of hypoxemia as it has been reported in the earliest stages of ARDS [45]. Common variants in VEGF signaling genes have been consistently associated with susceptibility or outcomes of ARDS patients, and VEGF is one of the most replicated genes associated with ARDS [6]. However, to date, variants from FLT1 have never been associated with ARDS susceptibility or outcomes, although some of them have been found to be associated with other relevant complex traits. In this sense, the FLT1 variant identified in this study was previously associated in two GWAS of large sample sizes and with multi-ethnic patients with coronary arterial disease [46, 47], where endothelium also plays a key pathophysiological role. Besides, a recent study has shown that two FLT1 variants are associated with a reduced count of red blood cells [48], and with risk of preeclampsia, perhaps influencing the maternal endothelial dysfunction [48, 49]. Taken together, this information supports the firm role of FLT1 gene variants in complex traits that are mechanistically linked, through the key role of endothelium, to the pathophysiology of the ARDS.",

Interestingly, rs9508025 was identified as one of the top-hits associated with coronary artery disease risk in a large GWAS study [50]. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to assess the functional effects of these variants in FLT1 expression, protein activity, or its relation with the soluble forms of the protein (i.e., sFLT1) in patient samples. It should be mentioned that increased levels of sFLT1 in plasma have been related with sepsis severity, organ dysfunction, and mortality [51, 52]. Additionally, high sFLT1 levels have also been found in BAL samples of ARDS patients [53]. Therefore, given that sFLT1 acts as a natural competitive inhibitor of VEGF [54], we postulate that the protective genetic variant found in FLT1 (or a variant in LD with it) could promote the increase of sFLT1 levels and hence, contributing to the protection from lung injury by reducing VEGF activity and the vascular permeability in ARDS patients. Further studies will be needed to evaluate this possibility.",

Therefore, the effect of environmental factors related with the hospital setting or study design on the association of the FLT1 variant with ARDS susceptibility is minimal. In addition, since no adjustment for population stratification was performed in the discovery sample, the replication in an independent sample with appropriate adjustments suggests minimal confounding effects due to population stratification. However, the top prioritized finding in the published GWAS of ARDS (rs9508026) [12] was not tested due to the fact that this did not allow the design of a genotyping assay so that, an alternative SNP was captured. In addition, although we prioritized the top significant SNP, we only considered one variant per gene for association studies. Therefore, other genetic variants not analyzed in our study (including rarer variants) could also be relevant in this syndrome, and this limitation could explain the lack of significance in the results for the other three genes.",

The use of this kind of controls allows reducing the possible selection bias caused by differences among cases and controls beyond the disease process itself and potential risk factors [56, 57]. Additionally, they provide stronger association effect estimates than hospital-based controls when cases have been recruited from hospitals since the association evidence revealed by population-based controls include those obtained by using controls from the hospital [56]. As a drawback, potential confounders related to the differences in age and comorbidities among cases and the population-based controls may have affected the findings of the discovery study. However, the results replicated in the independent ARDSnet/iSPAAR Consortium study, where no differences in age and comorbidities were detected (controls were patients at-risk) allowing to control more closely the environmental factors. This strongly reinforces the validity of our findings.",

For now, our studies preclude concluding whether or not the FLT1 gene variant is directly associated with sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility or with the aggravation of sepsis.

These analyses revealed neuron projection morphogenesis and signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as differentially deregulated pathways, as well as in independent human genomic data. Among the genes contained in both pathways (9 and 44 genes, respectively), only those with at least one significant SNP (p value \u2264 0.01) in the GWAS of ARDS were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmatic 2, heavy chain 1 (DYNC2H1), fms-related tyrosine kinase-1 (FLT1), integrin, alpha-1 (ITGA1), and peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), the latter was excluded for association analyses because the top SNP was monomorphic in the discovery study",
