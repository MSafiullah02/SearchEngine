It is crucial to highlight that the definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and a normal (negative) chest CT does not rule out diagnosis. However, currently, the RT-PCR result has taken longer than CT reports to be available, so CT has taken an important role in a comprehensive assessment of patients, for demonstrating high sensitivity (although low specificity), to detect the most frequent pulmonary findings of the disease.",

We also included an approximate estimate of extent of pulmonary involvement by the disease (visual analysis), which has been considered useful by them in management of patients, together with other clinical data and physical examination.
