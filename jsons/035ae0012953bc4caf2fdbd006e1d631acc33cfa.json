A small amount of literatures have reported that the infection rate of COVID-19 was higher in cancer patients compared with non-cancer patients. In addition, cancer patients are more likely to turn to severe COVID-19 cases than non-cancer patients. [2] [3] [4] In this letter, we describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of cancer patients with COVID-19 infection.",

Compared with the mild group, patients in the severe/critical group were more likely to have dyspnea (50%). Among the 37 patients, thirteen patients had a history of anti-cancer therapy including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy within one month before hospitalization; six patients in the mild group and seven patients in the severe/critical group respectively. However, with/without the cancer therapy history did not differ significantly between the two groups, suggesting that anti-cancer therapy did not effect on the severity of COVID-19 among these cancer patients. It is noteworthy that the most common cancer was colorectal cancer (29.7%), followed by lung cancer (21.6%) and breast (18.9%). Among the severe/critical patients, there were seven colorectal cancer patients. Previous studies indicated that lung cancer patients were the most common to be infected, which needs more multicenter retrospective studies with a larger sample size to identify. [3] [4] [5] Studies have shown that the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases was poor, while the prognosis of patients with two or more basic diseases would be even worse. 6 In our study, a total of twelve COVID-19-infected cancer patients were complicated with underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc., accounting for 32.4%. In the severe/critical group, 8 WBC count, \u00d710 9 /L 3.5-9. derlying diseases, which was two times higher than that in the mild group, although there was no statistical difference between the two groups. Moreover, five cancer patients died, with a mortality rate of 13.5%, all of which occurred in the severe/critical group. In terms of the results of laboratory tests, we interestingly found that the numbers of neutrophil, NLR, IL-6, LDH and PCT ( Table 2 ) in the severe/critical group were significantly higher than those in the mild group. Studies have shown that increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes will increase the risk of severe illness in COVID-19 patients. 6 At the same time, the increase of NLR was also an independent prognostic factor in T1-2 rectal cancer patients. 7 In addition, LDH and PCT were significantly higher in the severe/critical group than that in the mild group. These two indexes were also increased in the general population of patients required ICU admission. 6 Moreover, IL-6 was known to participate in the storm of inflammatory factors caused by COVID-19. The storm could be the main cause of death in infected patients. 8 Therefore, we should pay more attention to the above laboratory indicators in order to identify early and reduce the severe ratio and mortality of cancer patients with COVID-19.",
