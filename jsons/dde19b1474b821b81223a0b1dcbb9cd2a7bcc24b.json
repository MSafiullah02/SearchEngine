Previous epidemics or pandemics of coronaviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The most recent pandemic of coronavirus infection is coronavirus disease that is caused by SARS-CoV2 [1, 2] . The symptoms of COVID-19 infection usually appear after an incubation period of about five days. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 illness are fever, cough, and fatigue; other symptoms include headache, hemoptysis, and dyspnea, among others. In the most severe cases, patients may develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac problems, and multiorgan failure [1] . The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019 [1] ; however, when we searched the MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed), from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020, with the key word \"COVID 19\", surprisingly 1655 articles were yielded. This shows that COVID-19 pandemic is of great global public health concern.",

Articles written in English were all included in this search. To ensure literature saturation, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies or relevant reviews identified through the search. Both authors participated through each phase of the review independently (screening, eligibility, and inclusion). They independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. They obtained full reports for all titles that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or where there was any uncertainty. Authors screened the full text reports and decided whether these meet the inclusion criteria. They resolved any disagreement through discussions. Neither of the authors were blind to the journal titles or to the study authors or institutions.",

In the reported patients with SARS-CoV, CSF tested positive for the virus [15, 16] . In one study of 183 hospitalized children with clinically suspected acute encephalitis, 22 (12%) had coronavirus infection (type was not specified) by detection of anti-CoV IgM [17] . In a study of 70 patients with MERS-CoV infection, altered mental status was reported in 26% of the patients and 9% of the people had seizure [18] .

Hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures and status epilepticus to happen in these patients. Impaired mental status has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19 [9, 14] ; but, this manifestation has never been studied appropriately in previous studies (Table 3) . When visiting a patient who is in a critical medical condition and has a change in mental status, one should make sure that nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is not a part of the clinical scenario. The diagnosis of NCSE is frequently overlooked, with patients in critical medical conditions having other serious problems. It is necessary to perform continuous EEG monitoring Table 2 The search keywords included \"coronavirus\" and those in the first column of the in any patient with a critical medical condition, who has a change in mental status, in order to make a timely diagnosis of NCSE [19] . Salzburg Consensus Criteria for Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus is a helpful guide to make a diagnosis of NCSE in critically ill patients [20] .",
