RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, but other causes also exist, including parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumonovirus, coronavirus, and bocavirus (Pavia, 2011). Bronchiolitis is highly contagious and spreads through direct contact with nasal secretions, airborne droplets, and fomites, which are contaminated surfaces that aid the spread of viral infections. RSV bronchiolitis often leads to a secondary bacterial infection and pneumonia (Thorburn, Harigopal, Reddy, Taylor, & van Saene, 2006).",

Palivizumab (Synagis) is a vaccine that has been shown to be effective in preventing RSV in infants at high risk for complications (Winterstein, Hampp, & Saidi, 2012). According to the most recent policy on palivizumab of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases (2009), high-risk infants should receive palivizumab once a month for a maximum of 5 months during RSV season until they reach 24 months of age, and other premature infants who qualify for prophylaxis should receive palivizumab monthly for a maximum of 3 months during the RSV season. Palivizumab dosage is 15 mg per kg (AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2009) and costs on average $1074 per 50-mg vial (Mahadevia, Masaquel, Polak, & Weiner, 2012), making the treatment cost for a 3-kg infant approximately $966 for a single dose of palivizumab, or approximately $5000 for 5 months' administration early in life. As the child grows, so does the dose required. In the second year of life, the cost can be $3000 per month (for a child who weighs more than 10 kg) or up to $15,000 for 5 months of the RSV season (Hampp et al., 2011). In Florida's Medicaid population, Hampp and associates (2011) concluded that the cost of palivizumab prophylaxis to prevent RSV-related hospitalizations \u201cfar exceeded the savings associated with prevented hospitalizations\u201d (p. 502). This cost-benefit analysis highlights the need to identify less costly ways to prevent and treat RSV-related ALRIs.",

Cultural and health practices can contribute to vitamin D insufficiency or VDD by preventing infants from acquiring vitamin D from sun exposure. First, in some cultures infants are swaddled when outdoors, minimizing their sun exposure (Najada, Habashneh, & Khader, 2004). Second, applying sunscreen to limit the sun's damage to skin is recommended, especially in children, because 25% of lifetime sun exposure is estimated to occur before 18 years of age, a time of high vulnerability to the potentially toxic effects of sun exposure (Balk & AAP, Council on Environmental Health and Section on Dermatology, 2011). However, sunscreen suppresses cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 by blocking the absorption of ultraviolet B radiation (Matsuoka, Ide, Wortsman, MacLaughlin, & Holick, 1987). Third, mothers are likely to have vitamin D insufficiency or VDD for the same reasons as their infants (Lee et al., 2007). At its best, breast milk provides little vitamin D and even less if a mother is vitamin D deficient (Wagner & Greer, 2008).",

Further adding to comparison challenges, two different units of measurement were used in the reviewed studies to assess vitamin D levels: nanomole per liter and nanogram per milliliter. We converted all values to nanograms per milliliter to facilitate comparison between studies. For converting vitamin D levels, 1 nmol/L equals 0.4 ng/ml (National Institutes of Health, 2011). Therefore, values in nanomoles per liter were multiplied by 0.4 to convert to nanograms per milliliter.",

In a study of 152 children younger than 59 months of age with pneumonia at Al-Sabeen hospital in Sana'a, Yemen, VDD was an independent predictor of persistent hypoxemia for children admitted with pneumonia (p = .021; Banajeh, 2009).

Treatment failure was defined as modification of treatment because of worsening clinical condition, development of a comorbid condition, such as bacterial meningitis, or death. Likewise, Inamo and colleagues (2011) studied 28 infants in Tokyo, Japan, and found that, compared with infants who had 25(OH)D levels of 6 ng/ml or more, infants with 25(OH)D levels of < 4 ng/ml were significantly more likely to need supplementary oxygen and ventilator management (p < .01). Similarly, McNally and colleagues (2009), previously discussed, found that children with ALRI in a Canadian pediatric intensive care unit had significantly lower vitamin D levels than did control subjects, who were children hospitalized for something other than ALRI (19.6 \u00b1 9.6 vs. 33.2 \u00b1 12.0 ng/ml, p = .001).

In a study in Sana'a, Yemen, Banajeh (2009) found that VDD significantly decreased the percentage of circulating polymorph nuclear neutrophils (37% vs. 47%; adjusted OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95; p = .02), which are important innate immune cells that migrate into the lung tissues and kill bacteria and viruses through phagocytosis. In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Afghanistan by Manaseki-Holland and colleagues (2010), 224 children admitted with pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive either a single-dose 100,000 IU oral vitamin D supplement or a placebo. No vitamin D levels were assessed during the trial, and it was not stated when the supplements or placebos were administered. Manaseki-Holland and associates (2010) assessed the frequency of repeat pneumonia episodes during the 90-day posttreatment period. Children who received a vitamin D supplement had a significantly lower risk of a repeat episode compared with children who received a placebo (92 vs. 122; RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-.94; p=.01). These results suggest vitamin D supplementation might strengthen the immune system. Because Manaseki-Holland and colleagues (2010) did not assess vitamin D levels, it is not known whether the children had VDD.",

As needed, we converted vitamin D values to nanogram per milliliter to facilitate comparison between studies. In addition, researchers used thresholds ranging from 9 to 20 ng/ml to determine VDD (see Table 3\n). This range could explain why some studies found that VDD was significantly associated with ALRI in children, but others did not. When using a higher threshold, researchers would be less likely to detect a difference in prevalence of VDD between cases with ALRI and control subjects.",

Camargo and colleagues (2007) further relied on maternal recall by asking mothers to complete a food frequency questionnaire and then using the information to assess vitamin D intake. Maternal self-report can be inaccurate because mothers might incorrectly remember past events or not understand the questions. Also, mothers might hesitate to report their children's illnesses if they believe reporting illnesses would reflect poorly on their abilities as mothers and be less socially acceptable (Lau, Hurst, Smith, & Schanler, 2007).",

Additionally, Carroll and colleagues did not specify when the bronchiolitis score was determined, and scores can vary widely, depending on the timing of assessment (e.g., on admission versus prior to discharge) and when the infant had last undergone suctioning or received a respiratory treatment.

In contrast, other researchers used control subjects who were children admitted to the hospital for illnesses other than ALRI (McNally et al., 2009, Muhe and Lulseged, 1997).

The IOM and AAP have made recommendations regarding vitamin D intake. For pregnant and lactating women, a daily intake of 600 IU vitamin D per day is recommended (IOM, 2011). Most prenatal vitamins contain 400 IU vitamin D. For all breastfed infants, the AAP recommends a 400 IU vitamin D supplement daily beginning soon after birth for all breastfed infants, as well as children who consume less than 1 L of vitamin D\u2013fortified formula or milk per day and adolescents who obtain less than 400 IU vitamin D per day through vitamin D\u2013fortified milk or foods (Wagner & Greer, 2008). Vitamin D supplementation forms for infants and children are listed in Table 4\n(Casey et al., 2010). Of note, there is a discrepancy between the multivitamin dose manufacturers recommend for 2- and 3-year-old children (1/2 tablet, 200 IU) and the amount of vitamin D the AAP recommends for vitamin D supplementation (400 IU).",

Health care providers should also consider assessing vitamin D levels for children who have a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency, such as poor dietary vitamin D intake and/or limited sunlight exposure (Mithal et al., 2009), or for women who are pregnant or lactating (Holick, et al., 2011).",
