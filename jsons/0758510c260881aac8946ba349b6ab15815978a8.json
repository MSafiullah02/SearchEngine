Rhinoviral infections occur year round, with well-defined periods of prevalence in the fall and spring accounting for about 40% of infections in the adult population. 19 Coronaviruses are also considered to be a major cause of winter colds and tend to be more common in the 15-to 19-year-old age group.ll, 38 The enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus, occur mostly during the late summer and early autumn months and, even though not a common cause of URI,S! are of particular significance to athletes engaged in intensive training regimens.

Other research on URI transmissions indicates that athletes could spread the virus through shared athletic equipment and towels. Hand-to-hand transmission has been demonstrated to occur under certain experimental conditions,33 but it is questionable how much this contributes to natural transmission. Athletes who belong to teams housed in crowded dormitories, classrooms, and gymnasiums can pass respiratory viruses back and forth to each other, which may account for the higher incidence of URIs during cooler monthsY Exposure to cold temperatures, damp environments, or drafts does not seem to enhance vulnerability to a URI. 23, 69 Many athletes believe that exercise improves their resistance to infection and report that they have fewer colds and other respiratory tract infections?3 There are relatively few studies that have explored the rela-tionship between physical activity and URI.

Friman 29 assessed isometric strength in subjects with recent viral infections and a matched control group. A 5% to 15% reduction in isometric strength was found in infected subjects that had not fully recovered compared with reference values 1 month after illness. Astrom et all examined muscle tissue obtained from patients recovering from recent viral and mycoplasma illnesses and noted significantly reduced oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscle enzyme activity in infected patients. Electron microscopy showed focal abnormalities in muscles similar to changes seen in some types of muscular diseases. When muscle biopsies were repeated 3 months after illness, these problems were almost completely resolved. A study by Friman et apo in 1985 found that isometric strength and cardiac stroke volume were reduced during the pyrexial phase of sandfly fever. Muscle performance decrements, which were correlated to subjective symptoms such as myalgia, recovered with defervescence; however, stroke volume remained below the preinfection baseline during early recovery. During fever, an increased heart rate maintained cardiac output at preinoculation levels, whereas cardiac output fell in early convalescence. This decrease in cardiac output correlated significantly with the severity of fever. Sandfly fever is an unusual viral infection and may not be representative of typical viral illness in humans, but these findings are disturbing and warrant further investigation. Sudden death has occurred in young people and is often associated with vigorous exercise. In a study of 78 sudden deaths during or immediately after exercise, Jokl and McClellan 40 found a history of recent URI in 5 out of 78 (6%). Cardiovascular problems accounted for most of the remainder. It has not been proved that intercurrent viral illness increases the risk of sudden death during exercise, but there are a surprising number of anecdotal reports of deaths in young healthy people who had been vigorously exercising during an acute viral illness. 64 Several studies have demonstrated that exhaustive exercise after contracting an infection may be detrimental, possibly owing to the increased virulence of the coxsackievirus, which has a predilection for the heart muscle with intense exercise. 62 The myocarditis and pericarditis that these viruses produce may increase the risk of acute arrhythmias leading to sudden death. 44 ,75 In a 1991 report, 2 of 34 sports-related sudden cardiac deaths were from myocarditis: a 14-year-old boy who died while swimming and a 35-year-old man who died while running. lO In these two deaths, the only cardiac abnormality at autopsy was focal microscopic myocyte necrosis associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate. Neither patient had a history of fever or flu-like illness; however, this study was retrospective. It is possible that a viral infection caused the myocarditis, and exercise, in the face of this myocarditis, triggered an arrhythmic death. 24 Several investigations have examined the effects of URI on pulmonary function and found detectable abnormalities. Decreases in maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow rates in both children and adults have been demonstrated. 18 ,61 Small or peripheral airway abnormalities are also associated with URP' 12 Respiratory muscle strength was studied in 12 subjects who developed naturally acquired URI, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures fell significantly during these infections, 50 The lowest pressures usually occurred between the third and seventh day of clinical illness, which was often after the peak of clinical symptoms, Full recovery did not take place until the 14th day (Fig. 2) . The authors concluded that weakness of the inspiratory muscles may contribute to breathlessness during exertion, which is a common symptom in previously healthy young adults who develop acute URIs. These studies indicate that asymptomatic mechanical dysfunctions of the lungs are a frequent sequelae of acute viral URIs and that deterioration in pulmonary function can occur even after apparently mild common colds with no clinical evidence of lung involvement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2369, "end": 2371, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2618, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2753, "text": "44 ,75", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3312, "end": 3314, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3540, "end": 3546, "text": "18 ,61", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3813, "end": 3815, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4014, "end": 4022, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Effects"}, {"text": "Unexplained deterioration in athletic performance can in some individuals be traced to either recent respiratory tract infections or subclinical viral infections that run a protracted course. 63 Daniels et ai/a for example, concluded that during a mild febrile state, there is a marked effect on the ability or willingness of some individuals to perform both cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal exercise.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 194, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effects"}, {"text": "Infections that are subclinical in the normal population may greatly affect maximum performance in athletes.

For competitive athletes who are afraid to miss any training days even when ill, Eichner 25 recommends athletes do a neck check. If symptoms are located \"above the neck,\" such as stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, or scratchy throat with no constitutional symptoms, the athlete should be allowed to proceed cautiously through their scheduled workout at half-speed. After a few minutes, if the head clears and the athlete feels better, he or she can gradually increase the intensity and finish the workout. If the individual feels worse, he or she should rest. The athlete with \"below the neck\" symptoms, such as fever, aching muscles, hacking or productive cough, vomiting, or diarrhea, should not train. If a patient has symptoms and signs of systemic involvement, 10 to 14 days should be allowed before resumption of full intensive training and exhaustive exercise to avoid relapse, increased risk of musculoskeletal injury, or potential life-threatening complications, such as cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia. These precautions are advised because of the growing documentation showing a relationship between intensive exercise and the risk of developing viral cardiomyopathy and other severe forms of viral infection?O Both epidemiologic and clinical data support the concept that heavy exertion increases the athlete's risk of URI because of negative changes in immune function. Considerable evidence indicates that environmental factors, such as improper nutrition and psychological stress, can compound the negative influence that heavy exertion and training can have on the immune system. Based on current understanding, the athlete is urged to eat a well-balanced diet, keep other life stresses to a minimum, avoid overtraining and chronic fatigue, keep away from individuals who are ill before and after important events, obtain adequate sleep, and space vigorous workouts and competitive events as far apart as possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 203, "text": "64 , 71", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recommendations"}, {"text": "Infectious mononucleosis (IM), the clinical and hematologic manifestations of which are most commonly observed in adolescents and young adults, was discovered in 1967 to be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Males and females have an approximately equal frequency of infection, whereas the rate is 12 to 30 times higher in whites than in blacks. The racial difference has been attributed to more frequent early life experience with EBV in blacks. 47 The incubation period for primary EBV infection is approximately 30 to 45 days.
