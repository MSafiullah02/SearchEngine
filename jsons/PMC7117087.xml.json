The envelope of the influenza A virus contains two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is responsible for cell attachment and membrane fusion, and NA enables the release of new virions from the cell through its cleaving of the bonds between HA and sialic acid. It also has a role in viral ingress by cleaving sialylated mucins to allow virus penetration through the mucous layer.\n1\n",

Antigenic shift only occurs in influenza A virus as it infects more than just humans. Antigenic shifts can result in epidemics and pandemics.

It forms either an \u03b1-2,3 or \u03b1-2,6 linkage, and it is this configuration that is recognized by the HA protein.\n10\nThe \u03b1-2,3 linkage is the major sialic acid found in the gastrointestinal tract of the duck. In contrast, the major sialic acid found in upper respiratory epithelial cells in humans contains the \u03b1-2,6 linkage. It is for this reason that not all avian strains can easily infect humans. For example, in order for avian influenza (H5N1) to infect humans, it must penetrate deep into the alveoli where there are more \u03b1-2,3 receptors.\n11\nOnce the virus attaches to the host cell, it enters the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The envelope fuses with the host cell, and M2 proteins (a target for amantadine) form ion channels, allowing entry of ribonucleoproteins necessary for viral uncoating and replication.\n10\nInitial response to infection is characterized by proinflammatory state. Th1 cells are activated and release proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and interleukin (IL)-2.\n12\n13\nThe secondary phase of infection is characterized by the anti-inflammatory state.

To summarize these studies, HSV reactivation starts in the oropharyngeal tract in 20 to 50% of ICU patients, 3 to 5 days after ICU admission, followed by a descending lower respiratory tract colonization in 20 to 65% of mechanically ventilated patients, after a median of 7 days of MV and with a peak of virus load 12 days after MV start.\n80\nIn some patients, a true lung infection (HSV bronchopneumonitis) can occur after a median of 14 days of MV; in a study evaluating 201 patients with prolonged (>4 days) MV, Luyt et al found that 20% of them had HSV bronchopneumonitis with cytological and/or histological signs of deep lung infection.\n76\nDistinguishing HSV lung reactivation from infection may be difficult; indeed, lung infection is defined by clinical signs, presence of HSV, and cytological/histological criteria, that is, HSV-specific nuclear inclusions on cells collected during bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\n76\nHowever, this technique is difficult to implement and may be subjective. Virus load in BAL fluid, with a cutoff set at 10\n5\ncopies/mL, may be a good alternative.\n76\n78\n81\n",

However, the exact significance of herpesviridae reactivation is poorly understood. In some cases, it is associated with a true disease; but in some cases, the relationship between viral reactivation and viral disease is not established. In these latter cases, whereas a specific antiviral treatment may improve outcome remains to be determined. To date, neither prophylactic acyclovir to prevent HSV reactivation nor prophylactic ganciclovir to prevent CMV reactivation can be recommended; preemptive treatment with acyclovir in patients with oropharyngeal HSV reactivation or ganciclovir in patients with CMV blood reactivation is under investigation (PTH [Preemptive Treatment for Herpesviridae] study, Clinical Trials n\u00b0 NCT02152358). Curative treatment of HSV bronchopneumonitis or CMV lung disease is based on expert opinions in patients with either cytological/histological proofs of lung involvement, high viral load, or specific clinical and biological patterns suggestive of CMV.\n96\n97\n",

The patient may have acquired these infections from the community, the donor organ (donor-derived infections), and/or reactivation of an endogenous latent virus. HSV, especially CMV and EBV, is among the most common of the opportunistic viral pathogens affecting these patients in addition to respiratory viruses.
