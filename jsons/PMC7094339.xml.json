Unfortunately for a large proportion of the planet, infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 disability, in some cases preventable blindness,12, 13 and other serious sequelae. Because of our location, significant public health and medical infrastructure, and widespread immunizations against a wide array of pathogens, the US has been fortunately isolated from many infectious diseases, with the notable exception of tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, Lyme, West Nile, pneumonia, and influenza-related illness, as well as hospital-acquired infections. Of note, West Nile virus infections in the United States resulted in more than 140 deaths in 2006.14\n",

Science can provide timely antimicrobials, even vaccines to help thwart the spread of infections. But disease and health care occur at the street level where person-to-person transmission occurs. Hospital and emergency department (ED) overcrowding remains a significant problem in containing the spread of infections. While some health care facilities (HCF) have improved access to masks and hand sanitizers as well as cough/sneeze etiquette posters, these can have limited value if manpower shortages, cultural imperatives, for example, going to a health care facility with many members of the family, and language and education barriers work against social distancing, personal hygiene, and other containment strategies. Some practices and health care facilities have implemented old pediatric strategies of placing potentially contagious patients into separate areas. Clearly this is a space-, manpower-, and resource-intensive strategy, but one that may reduce transmission of illness from those who are affected. A serious discussion on how to cohort and isolate potentially contagious people, as well as strategies to alleviate overcrowding, much of which stems from the misuse of ED and HCF for primary care problems, is vitally necessary.47\n",
