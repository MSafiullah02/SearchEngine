            "text": "The chikungunya virus\n(CHIKV) is a member of the Togaviridae, genus alphavirus and was first described\nin East Africa (southern province of Tanzania) in 1952\u20131953.1,2 This mosquito-transmitted alphavirus (mainly by Aedes\nspp.) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever\n(CHIKF), a disease characterized by myalgia, polyarthralgia, fever,\nnausea, headaches, maculopapular rash, and complications including\nlymphopenia, lethal hepatitis, dermatologic lesions, and encephalitis.3\u22125 Although chikungunya fever is rarely fatal, symptoms such as myalgia\nand arthralgia have been reported to last for years after clearance\nof the infection, resulting in an impaired quality of life.6\u22128 Since the re-emergence of the virus in 2005, outbreaks have occurred\nin more than 40 countries throughout the world, not only in Southeast\nAsia and Africa but also in Europe (Italy and France) as well as America.9\u221211 Currently, neither vaccines nor pharmacotherapy are available to\nprevent or treat an infection.12\u221214 To date, the only available treatment\nis the alleviation of symptoms by using NSARs like ibuprofen, naproxen,\nor acetaminophen. Occasionally, corticosteroids are administered to\npatients to relieve symptoms like fever and pain.15\u221217 Up to now,\nthe antiviral activity of small molecules, compounds from natural\nsources, and immune modulators on the replication of chikungunya virus\nhave been investigated. Several compounds, ranging from antivirals\nwith a broad spectrum like ribavirin to harringtonine (a cephalotaxine\nalkaloid) and IFN-\u03b1, were found to be active, targeting different\nstages in the alphavirus life cycle. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness\nand, in some cases, potent antiviral activity in vitro, none of these drugs passed the clinical trial phase.18\u221225 Also, the utilization of the already known antimalaria drug chloroquine\nas possible antiviral treatment is highly discussed regarding the\npotential risks and benefits for the patients.26\u221230 Therefore, the development of safe and effective\nnew antivirals against CHIKV is highly desirable.31 This problem was addressed within the EU FP7 collaborative\nproject SILVER. In this project, the small molecular hit CIM016321\n(later referred as 1, Figure 1), which was identified previously by high-throughput\nscreening by the Center for Innovation and Stimulation of Drug Discovery\n(CISTIM) and the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), was further investigated\nand a hit to lead program was initiated.",

The result from 8d (EC50 of 33 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM) indicated that the hydrogen bond donor\nis not essential for actively enhancing the antiviral activity, although\nits pure absence seemed to decrease the activity.
