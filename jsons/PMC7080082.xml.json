Hence, based on the host type, the attenuated vaccines created as nerve tissue vaccines, embryonated egg vaccines, and cell culture vaccines.

Owing to safety and simplicity, DNA vaccines have several advantages over conventional vaccines especially in compare to attenuated and killed vaccines. After transfection of plasmid DNA, target antigen is expressed inside cells and induces immune responses of the host (Hudu et al. 2016). Although DNA vaccines have several benefits including high stability, cost affectivity and the ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, some limitations still exist regarding the use of these vaccines (Okuda et al. 2014). For instance, due to the low extent of antigens produced in the body, Th2-type immune responses is weakly induced in DNA vaccines (Shi et al. 2014). At present, researchers using techniques such as in vivo electroporation have improved the efficacy of these vaccines.",

Emil von Behring first indicated that serum of rabbit immunized with tetanus toxin can control tetanus infection in the rabbits (Winau and Winau 2002) (Casadevall and Scharff 1994). Afterwards, Emil von Behring received Nobel Prize in 1901 due to development of serum therapy to diphtheria (Winau and Winau 2002). Until the early twentieth century, serum therapy was a successful treatment against most of viral infections such as influenza, measles (Janeway 1945), and polio (Hammon et al. 1954) and bacterial infections including Haemophilus influenza B, meningococcus, and pneumococcus (Alexander et al. 1946) (Casadevall and Scharff 1994). However, when antibiotics as therapeutics agents of bacterial infections were discovered, the application of serum therapy was reduced. With development of hybridoma technology by Milstein and K\u00f6hler in 1975 regarding generation of murine monoclonal antibodies through immortalizing B cells known as hybridomas, a new era was began in the treatment of different diseases using monoclonal antibodies and passive immunization (K\u00f6hler and Milstein 1975).",

Commonly, phages can control infections through lysis of infected bacteria (Lin et al. 2017). Since phages target only specific bacterial species and have no effect on the normal bacterial flora, so the possibility of secondary infections in phage therapy is lower than antibiotic therapy. Despite, many advantages of phage therapy such high specificity, low toxicity and self-amplification and anti-biofilm activity, there is no still FDA approved phage therapy as alternative to antibiotics (Donlan 2009) (Bourdin et al. 2014), because of phages that are usually identified and eliminated by the host immune system through generation of specific antibodies. On the other hand, intracellular infections maybe inaccessible for phage particles (Henein 2013). Nevertheless, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections has been led to redevelopment of phage therapy as alternative to treat infections. One of the notable progresses in phage therapy is related to identification of the genes encoding lytic enzymes of phage that are expressed during lytic cycle by the bacterial host. The lytic proteins hydrolyze the cell wall of the host to excrete viral progeny. In this respect, two main classes of lytic proteins have been isolated comprising a peptidoglycan protein called lysine and a transmembrane protein known as holin which lysine protein plays the main role in the lysis of bacterial cell, so it is more notable as an antimicrobial candidate (Lin et al. 2017). In a study performed on diabetic patients, phage therapy significantly reduced the foot ulcer infections caused by MDR S. aureus (Fish et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Newly, researchers improved the efficiency of phage therapy to target drug-resistant bacteria through engineering phages and using of the lytic enzymes of phages (Lin et al. 2017). Until now, several lytic proteins such ABgp46, PlyF307, Cpl-1, PlyCD, and PlySs2 have been purified and their antibacterial properties confirmed against various drug-resistant bacteria such as MDR A. baumannii, Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa, and Salmonella (S.) typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and MRSAs (Oliveira et al. 2016),(Schmelcher et al. 2015). For instance, in one study, a phage cocktail was designed to treat wound infections caused by A. baumannii in which four A. baumannii lysing phages were combined to one phage inhibiting bacterial growth to target both capsulated and uncapsulated bacteria. The inhibitory effect of the cocktail phage was confirmed on murine model (Regeimbal et al. 2016).",

In this respect, RNAi technology is a promising strategy to struggle intracellular infections, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, RSV, influenza, HSV, malaria, and tuberculosis but still there are challenges regarding employment of suitable carriers such viral and non-viral vectors for the effective delivery of RNAs. In addition to RNAi technology, CRISPR has newly been implemented to target virulence factors of infectious bacteria. Despite the notable advances regarding the feasibility of harnessing CRISPR strategy for tackling infections, the improvement of CRISPR technology through production of nucleases with more cleavage efficiency and specificity is still needed. On the other hand, development of appropriate delivery systems with higher safety could improve treatment of resistant infections by CRISPR technology (Trevisan et al. 2017).",
