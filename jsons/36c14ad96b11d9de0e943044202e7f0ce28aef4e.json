The basis of disaster risk management is the maturity of institution and policy. Different countries have different disaster risk management institutions and policies, whose assessment standards are the utilization efficiency and effectiveness of disaster reduction resources. The core of disaster risk management is according to law and regulation administration, and the key to disaster risk management is the implementation of policies. Disaster risk identification, monitoring, assessment, simulation, early warning, etc., are all important scientific and technical securities to improve the disaster risk management. Disaster risk management is the foundation of disaster risk prevention.",

These modern risks are generally multi-dimensional social phenomenon, involving natural, social, economic, psychological, and administrative levels. Interaction between the various risks is more closely linked, often forming risk chain which is induced by each other, with a larger influence scope and a more complex mechanism. High uncertainty and complexity often drew heated debate between the public and even the experts, which made the risk appraisal and decision more difficult. The limitations of traditional risk management institutions which are based on the quantitative scientific measurement and expert system of a single discipline have been exposed.

The President also designated FEMA to be in principal charge of all the disaster preparation and disaster reduction plans. And in the institutional restructuring file which is submitted to the Congress, it is said that his work has been guided by four principles: (1) an official who is accountable to the president owns the federal power to be responsible for dealing with major domestic emergencies; (2) an efficient civil defense system needs the most effective use of all emergency (disaster) resources; (3) whenever possible, emergency response rests with the federal official body; (4) the federal disaster mitigation activities should be integrated with emergency preparedness and response functions. Since the implementation of disaster risk policy, it has played an important role in disaster risk management and disaster risk reduction of the USA.

Though the China SARS events in 2003, the bird flu outbreak in 2004 and disasters which have frequently caused major casualties in recent years seemed not related to each other, they are intrinsically linked together to herald the coming of a high-risk society (Wu 2011) . The situation in China is more complicated, and as a developing and populous country which is in the social transformation period, the traditional and modern risks coexist. The challenge faced in risk management is more difficult. China is entering a crucial stage of social and economic development, which is the key to development as well as the period of prominent contradictions.",
