Some of these challenges include closure of substance use treatment clinics, focus of emergency departments on COVID-19 patients, social distancing and shelter in place orders affecting mental health, bystander overdose rescue, threats to income and supply of substances for people who use drugs. While the initial changes in regulation allowing buprenorphine prescribing by telehealth are welcomed by providers and patients, many additional innovations are required to ensure that additional vulnerabilities and hurdles created by this pandemic scenario do not further fan the flames of the opioid epidemic.",

In a pre-COVID time, the plan for her would have been established: The certified peer recovery specialist (CRS) who knew her previously would have met her in the emergency department (ED) as an advocate and trusted confidant, an \"X-waivered\" emergency medicine (EM) provider would have written her a \"bridge script\" of buprenorphine-naloxone, and she would be \"warmly handed-off\" to a provider in the community to continue her treatment. There would be challenges along the way but there would be an identifiable path to accessing buprenorphine, a highly regulated but effective medication that treats opioid use disorder. extent of the public health issue, gun violence, homelessness, or addiction, we care for patients when they experience the most extreme exacerbations of these problems. When the opioid epidemic filled our beds with near fatal overdoses, and other opioid use disorder-related conditions, the leaders in our specialty rose to the challenge and inspired their colleagues to fill the gaps. Whether through efforts at opioid stewardship i , naloxone distribution and education, initiation of treatment with buprenorphine ii , or implementation of certified recovery specialist programs iii to help our patients navigate the labyrinth of treatment, emergency departments across the country had ramped up to address what was the biggest public health threat faced by our nation.",

Seemingly overnight, any condition that is not immediately life threatening has become a lesser priority and the walls of our department are seen as less welcoming amongst those not already infected. Similarly, we have seen outpatient colleagues, whether in primary care settings or specialized addiction medicine treatment centers, rapidly transition their services to telehealth and juggle caring for their existing patient panels while being pulled to work in new capacities in the hospital. As we providers all continue to learn to coexist with the COVID19 pandemic, we worry about what this means for our patients who, despite this \"new normal\", will continue to struggle with opioid use disorder.

Predictions of escalating deaths from COVID19 abound in every newspaper and medical journal and, in all likelihood, the mortality rate for patients with substance use disorder will be significantly higher than the general population. Furthermore, many patients do not have housing, so cannot isolate at all and will be cohorted with other COVID19 patients in shelters if they do become ill. Additionally, the stress and limitations of this new crisis exacerbates mental health conditions, which can act as a trigger for recurrence of use. Even the strategy of social distancing can prove dangerous to this population due to the increased risk of an isolated overdose without opportunity for rescue.

Virtual connections to care seem the safest strategy to both initiate and continue care. Rapid changes in regulations have allowed for immediate deployment and learnas-you-go strategies for telehealth platforms. In many cases, these platforms only require that a patient have a computer or phone and a health system account. Unfortunately, that creates a large divide between the socially vulnerable patients most at risk and the patient population that receives highly reimbursed care from the health system with ready access to their clinicians via email, phone, or telehealth appointments. Recognizing this gap, our goal is to provide a tool for communication, which will enable us to continue to care for them during this difficult time. One possibility that we are piloting at our institution is to provide phones for patients in need, which will enable a modicum of connectivity over the coming months while social distancing orders are Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society of Addiction Medicine.
