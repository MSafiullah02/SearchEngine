Alphaviruses are classified based on their geographical distribution into New World (NW) and Old World (OW) alphaviruses 1. OW alphaviruses are generally arthrogenic and include CHIKV and Sindbis virus, while NW alphaviruses such as VEEV, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and Western equine encephalitis virus are characterized by an encephalitogenic phenotype 1, 2. Alphaviruses replicate to very high titers in cell lines of mosquito and vertebrate origins and possess capability of storage in lyophilized form and their potential of spread in aerosol form makes them potential bioweapons 3. Thus, these viruses are recognized as category B priority pathogens by the U.S. government. VEEV has caused major epidemics in several parts of the world involving a large number of equids and humans 4. CHIKV has been documented to cause disease since 1953 but its explosive outbreak in 2005 in La R\u00e8union Island involved an overwhelming number of 300 000 reported cases 5. Since 2005, it has caused recurrent outbreaks in Asia and other parts of the world. The lack of effective and safe antiviral agents against alphaviruses including CHIKV and VEEV makes the pursuit of compounds with antiviral activity against these viruses highly imperative.",

            "text": "In alphaviruses, individual nonstructural proteins (nsPs) are produced post\u2010translationally after processing of a nonstructural polyprotein and they play an indispensable role in the alphaviral life cycle 2. Capping of the viral genome is a vital step in the alphaviral life cycle as this cap structure plays numerous biological roles including the protection of mRNA from cellular exonucleases and efficient recognition of the RNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) for the initiation of translation 6. Additionally, this cap structure also prevents recognition by members of the host innate immune pathways such as MDA5 and/or RIG\u2010I 7. Alphaviruses use a completely distinct molecular mechanism of capping of viral mRNA from the host cell. Cellular capping enzymes typically methylate GTP only after its transfer to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA. In contrast, the alphaviral capping enzyme, nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) caps viral RNA in two major steps: It first methylates GTP by transferring the methyl group from S\u2010adenosyl methionine (SAM), which acts as the methyl donor, to GTP and the methylated m7GMP moiety gets covalently attached to the nsP1 enzyme transiently during a guanylation (GT) step 8. S\u2010adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) is generated as a coproduct of this methyltransferase (MTase) step of capping reaction. The amino\u2010terminal of nsP2, another replication protein of alphavirus, harbors the RNA triphosphatase activity 9. It contributes to the capping reaction of alphaviruses by cleaving the \u03b3,\u03b2\u2010triphosphate bond specifically at the 5\u2032 end of the nascent RNA prior to the transfer of m7GMP to the nascent viral RNA by nsP1 in the guanylyltransferase (GTase) step. Mutational analyses of the protein and reverse genetics studies involving live virus showed that the abrogation of alphaviral nsP1 activity is detrimental to the viral growth proving that nsP1 capping activity is an essential step during viral replication 10.",

            "text": "Viruses within the alphavirus superfamily have been shown to replicate in membrane invaginations (spherules) in the host cell. nsP1 is also a vital component of the replication complex as it anchors the ensemble of nsPs and other replication factors on the membrane primarily through an amphipathic helix and secondarily through palmitoylation sites on the protein 11, 12, 13. The three\u2010dimensional structure of alphavirus nsP1 from any member of the alphavirus genus remains elusive. In the absence of the 3D structure of nsP1, the development of enzymatic assays for the screening or development of potent inhibitors targeting replication protein nsP1 is required. It will provide a platform for the identification and characterization of inhibitors of this viral enzyme for treating diseases caused by alphaviral infection. Lately, there has been a surge in the development of novel assays for nsP1 enzymatic activity to accentuate the pursuit of novel antiviral compounds. Previous efforts for the development of the assays for the biochemical characterization and inhibition assays against nsP1 were focussed on the GT step of the nsP1 enzymatic reaction 14, 15, 16. Gel\u2010based approach for inhibition study used a fluorescently labeled GTP (GTP\u2010ATTO) for detection or western blot/ELISA uses anti\u2010m3G/m7G\u2010cap monoclonal antibodies for quantification of nsP1 enzymatic activity 14, 15, 16. These immuno\u2010based assays target GT activity inhibition, utilize expensive antibodies, and are labor\u2010intensive and susceptible to the identification of false positives/false negatives. A fluorescence polarization (FP)\u2010based assay has also been developed for nsP1, which is used for screening of small molecules against CHIKV nsP1. This assay is based on monitoring the displacement of fluorescently labeled GTP analog by an inhibitory molecule 17. The screening potential of this FP\u2010based assay is restricted to the compounds competing for the GTP\u2010binding site on the enzyme.",

Regarding alphaviruses, broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents ribavirin and favipiravir, have been shown to have in vitro anti\u2010VEEV and anti\u2010CHIKV activity, respectively 25, 26. Additionally, a cytosine analog, D\u2010(\u2010)\u2010carbodine, showed moderate in vivo efficacy against VEEV 27. More recently, a modified nucleoside analog, \u03b2\u2010d\u2010N4\u2010hydroxycytidine, which was previously shown to be effective against hepatitis C virus 28 and human coronavirus 29, was found to inhibit CHIKV and VEEV replication in cell culture, suggesting that employing nucleoside analogs for alphaviral alleviation is a rewarding approach 30, 31.",

            "text": "In this study, a nonradioactive capillary electrophoresis (CE)\u2010based assay has been developed that measures the MTase activity of the alphaviral nsP1 capping enzyme independently of its GT activity. To achieve this, VEEV nsP1 (full\u2010length) and a C\u2010terminal truncated construct of CHIKV nsP1 were cloned, recombinantly expressed and purified. Using this CE\u2010based assay, the influence of various reaction parameters on the methylation reaction of VEEV and CHIKV nsP1 enzyme was determined. H37A mutant of VEEV nsP1 was designed and used to examine the formation of m7GTP during the alphaviral capping reaction using a different CE method. Additionally, the assay was used to characterize known inhibitors of alphavirus nsP1, sinefungin, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Using this assay, the possibility of using adenosine analogs for modulation of nsP1 MTase activity was investigated. One of the compounds was found to inhibit the MTase activity of both VEEV and CHIKV nsP1. The adenosine analog inhibitor identified using this assay was also validated for nsP1 inhibition using an orthogonal nonradioactive enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Further, the antiviral efficacy of the identified inhibitor was evaluated in vitro using cell\u2010based assays. Intriguingly, the compound showed significant inhibition of CHIKV in cell culture\u2010based studies, asserting the reliability of the developed assay. This novel CE\u2010based MTase assay and new approach of using adenosine analogs to target alphavirus nsP1 may promote the identification of novel therapeutics against alphaviruses.",

Intriguingly, it was observed that in the absence of metal ion the MTase reaction with GTP proceeds linearly for 2 h as the SAH formation showed a linear range. In contrast, when magnesium ion, which acts as a cofactor in the subsequent GT reaction, was present, the progress curve became nonlinear after 1 h (Fig. 4A). It is speculated that the subsequent GT reaction that guanylate nsP1 might affect the activity of the enzyme by product inhibition. Hence, to decouple the MTase and GT reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP with a \u03b2\u2010\u03b3 nonhydrolyzable bond, GIDP was used (Fig. 4B and 4C). The use of GIDP excludes the possibility of the guanylation of nsP1 that can interfere with the linearity of SAH formation over the reaction time. Thus, for subsequent assay development and testing of inhibitors GIDP was used instead of GTP as the methyl acceptor and the reaction time was maintained at 2 h. A typical electropherogram of the MTase nsP1 reaction assay mixture at different time points is shown in Figure 2. nsP1 mutant D63A (MTase\u2010deficient) of VEEV nsP1 was taken as a negative control and no increase in peak area corresponding to SAH with time in the MTase reaction mixture was observed.",

To achieve this, H37A mutation was engineered in VEEV nsP1 and purified H37A mutant was used for enzyme characterization. It was hypothesized that the m7GTP, which is otherwise formed transiently during the nsP1 capping reaction and covalently attaches itself to the alphavirus nsP1 protein as m7GMP moiety, could be observed in the reaction mixture when the MTase reaction is carried out with H37A mutant.

Evaluation of enzymatic activity in the presence of potential inhibitors led to the identification of adenosine analog 5\u2010IT as the inhibitor of MTase activity of the enzyme. The potent hit compound was further evaluated in a secondary orthogonal ELISA assay that quantitates m7GMP\u2010nsP1 adduct formed after nsP1 GT activity. 5\u2010IT showed a marked reduction in CHIKV replication as evident by the results of the plaque reduction assay, viral\u2010induced CPE reduction, qRT\u2010PCR, and IFA studies. The developed CE\u2010based assay can further accelerate the screening of inhibitors against nsP1 of alphaviruses and identification or development of new antiviral drugs against alphaviruses. With the effective inhibition of CHIKV replication in cell culture by 5\u2010IT, the possible new approach of targeting alphaviral nsP1 with adenosine analogs can be further investigated for identification and development of pan\u2010alphavirus antiviral agents.",
