The invitation reveals signs of how far the world's largest developing country has gone and where it might be going, and indicates open-mindedness in the current leadership or at least shows that they want to be perceived as being good listeners.",

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, constant threats of an avian influenza pandemic, and the recent milk scandal serve as reminders of the complex challenges confronting China's deficient and vulnerable health system and the serious economic, social, and global implications of the system's shortfalls. China's leaders, in their pursuit of an economic growth-dominated development agenda, have neglected the Government's responsibilities to adequately finance, organise, and regulate health care. The general complaint that it was \u201cToo difficult to see a doctor, too expensive to see a doctor!\u201d became one of the top issues in China's opinion polls.2, 3\n",

Now, the average cost of a single hospital admission is almost equivalent to China's annual per-capita income, and is more than twice the average annual income of the lowest two deciles of the population.4 Meanwhile, only 55% of urban and 21% of rural populations have any health insurance.4 Unsurprisingly, 13\u00b78% of urban and 15\u00b78% of rural households incurred catastrophic medical spending in 2003.4 Further, 15\u00b71% of urban residents and 21\u00b76% of rural residents, when they were ill, forewent medical care because they could not pay.5 Despite increasing costs, the Government's health budget accounts for less than 10% of the actual costs of public hospitals. China's fee-for-service payment system exacerbates cost escalation: doctors have strong financial incentives to over-prescribe because they rely on service revenue and drug sales for their income. Moreover, in view of the low level of professional ethics, there is a widespread belief that health-care providers put financial interests ahead of the patients' medical needs.6 Mistrust is the major reason for the worsening relationship between patients and doctors.",

Meanwhile, the Chinese people are demanding that their leaders come up with concrete and innovative action plans to achieve the lofty goals of better health care for all.

Frustrated by all this, the government might decide to suspend their attempts to include the public in policy making. But, if the process is perceived to be informative, with new and better ideas coming out; if the process can help prepare the masses for and obtain their support in implementing the new policies; if the process can help increase people's trust in and thus strengthen the Government's legitimacy and effectiveness to govern by establishing a new image of transparency, the experiment could have powerful spill-over effects beyond the health sector. Should the benefits from this experiment become clear without incurring out-of-control costs, both the Government and the people could be encouraged to try out a similar approach to reforming China's education, social security, and even its political systems. The flood gates of democracy will have been opened, which, once open, might be hard to close again.",
