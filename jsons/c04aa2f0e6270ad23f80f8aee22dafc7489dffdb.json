            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Canada in early March 2003, with the main outbreak occurring in association with Toronto hospitals [1] . Health-care workers were at increased risk for infection [2, 3] . Some of these infections occurred in locations where infection control precautions (1) may not yet have been instituted, (2) had been instituted but may not have been adequately followed, or (3) may not have been sufficiently protective. Recommended infection control precautions include the use of negative-pressure isolation rooms; N95 or equivalent respiratory protection; gloves, gowns, and eye protection; and careful hand hygiene [4] . Nevertheless, even with these precautions in effect, a number of healthcare workers became infected in the Toronto outbreaks, particularly when performing procedures such as intubations of patients with SARS [5, 6] . The epidemiologic characteristics of SARS coronavirus (CoV) infections initially suggested that the transmission of SARS was via direct contact and that airborne transmission occurred through large respiratory droplets; nevertheless, true airborne transmission has never been ruled out and may occur opportunistically [7] . The pattern of spread of SARS associated with sick patients traveling on aircraft suggested that airborne transmission may have occurred during the flights [8] . Recently, a study using modeling of airflow dynamics suggested that airborne transmission could account for transmission patterns of SARS in a multiple high-rise apartment building complex in Hong Kong [9] . The present study was performed in the midst of the Toronto outbreak, to examine whether environmental contamination of air or surfaces could explain the ongoing risk of transmission of SARS-CoV to health-care workers and visitors despite apparent compliance with recommended precautions.",

Air was drawn through a mm slit at a rate of 30 L/ 0.15 \u03eb 48 min and was impinged onto a 150-mm petri dish with a 12% gelatin base overlaid with the viral collection medium (sterile phosphate buffer with 7.5% bovine serum albumin, 10,0000 U/mL penicillin G, 10,000 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 25 mg/mL amphotericin B [Fungizone]). The 10 sampling heads were each programmed to sample the air for 18 min and were activated in sequence, for a total of 180 min of sample collection. Slit-sampling technology recovers any particles in the air and preserves them in a liquid specimen, maximizing the potential of recovering both viral nucleic acid as well as live virus, if present. Approximately 540 L of room air was filtered in 18 min to collect each sample, which yielded a sample volume of \u223c20 mL of viral transport buffer; a 100-mL aliquot was initially taken for nucleic acid extraction and PCR testing. Air was sampled in 4 patient rooms in hospital Z.",

For example, among 138 cases of secondary and tertiary spread in Hong Kong, 85 (62%) occurred among health-care workers [3] ; among 144 cases in Toronto, 73 (51%) occurred among health-care workers [11] . The possibility of aerosol infectious droplet spreading of the SARS virus may account for this apparent risk of transmission. The airborne transmission characteristics of infections are classified in 3 main categories-obligate, preferential, and opportunisticon the basis of the capacity of the particular agent to induce disease through fine-particle aerosols and via other routes [12] . Although our study was only able to investigate a limited number of patient rooms, the detection of SARS-CoV RNA in air samples suggests that SARS-CoV could be an opportunistic airborne infection. The detection of SARS-CoV RNA on frequently touched surfaces in the health-care environment, including a medication refrigerator in a nurses' station, demonstrates the importance of strict adherence to infection-control precautions, including the need to remove all gloves and to perform hand hygiene when leaving patient rooms. Electronic equipment needs particular attention, since, because of its moisture sensitivity, cleaning may intentionally be less thorough. Moreover, our data, coupled with results of experiments demonstrating survival of SARS-CoV for as long as 3 days on various surfaces [13] , indicate the importance of frequent and thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection in the control of SARS. Three of 4 of the areas where positive environmental samples were collected were occupied by patients with SARS who were 13, 21, and 28 days post-onset of symptoms at the time of sampling. This is in the range expected for virus shedding during the course of infection in patients with SARS.",

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV viral shedding from infected patients is at a peak between 10 and 15 days after onset of symptoms [14] , although virus shedding continues well into the convalescent phase in many cases. Although we did not detect viable virus on environmental surfaces, intensive cleaning and disinfection had been instituted, which may have inacti-vated any virus shed onto regularly cleaned surfaces. Cleaning regimes during the SARS outbreak were broadly similar in all 4 facilities: all used hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectants for surface cleaning twice per day. In the current study, specimens were collected under emergency conditions, and prior calibration of the detection system was not possible. The nested PCR test has a detection limit of \u223c0.3 TCID 50 units, as determined by serial dilution of specimens with a known titer of tissue culture-grown SARS-CoV. All specimens that were positive by nested PCR against the P gene were also tested with a secondary target, the M gene, which is less sensitive than the P gene target. When quantity of specimen permitted, positive samples were retested with alternative targets as many as 4 times. One of the specimens (from room 15, television remote) tested positive for both the P gene and the secondary M gene target; however, none of the specimens tested positive with the real-time PCR assay. The real-time PCR assay, with a detection limit of 3.0 TCID 50 units, is less sensitive than the nested PCR. This would suggest that specimens probably contained !1 TCID 50 unit. Hence, cultures were negative, and this indicates that all positive specimens contained !1 TCID 50 dose.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the DRDC Suffield high-resolution slit sampler was able to collect airborne SARS-CoV viral nucleic acid shed into the air by a patient with SARS who was recovering but still coughing actively. In this case, the patient was sitting near the sampler but was asked not to cough in the direction of the sampler, so that the possibility of large-droplet contamination of air samples was avoided. The slit-sampler technology has previously been proven effective for the detection of anthrax spores in a contaminated mail room [15] , and here we report its adaptation for detection of an aerosol of SARS-CoV under clinical conditions. This technology will be useful in future studies of airborne virus transmission. Detection of viable viruses in environmental air samples is problematic. Methods employing passive impingers to collect aerosol droplets falling into a liquid medium [16] are useful in aerosol chambers but are not suitable for detection of the extremely low concentrations of virus found in the clinical environment, where forced air is required to sample larger volumes. Dilution of the virus in the air, as well as air turnover, greatly reduces the viral RNA copy number available for detection methods. In the 2 other rooms where slit air samples were taken, all specimens were negative for SARS-CoV RNA. However, both rooms were occupied by patients with probable SARS who were on ventilators. Under these circumstances, one might expect less virus to be shed by coughing into the air, since the patient is intubated. Another possibility is that these patients had passed the phase of active virus shedding during the course of the disease. The PTFE filter method used in the present study did not result in detection of SARS-CoV. It may be that there was insufficient SARS-CoV RNA for detection, or, similarly, the virus may not have been present in the patient rooms at the time of sampling. Dry air filters have previously been demonstrated to recover rhinovirus nucleic acid under experimental conditions [17] , as well as that of varicella-zoster virus [18] and of respiratory syncytial virus and Bordetella pertussis [19] in clinical situations. However, these methods are not suitable for the recovery of viable viral particles. The advantage of the slit-sampling technology is its ability to sample large volumes of air directly into an aqueous medium, to sample the full range of particle sizes present in the air (since it does not rely on size exclusion, as in filtering), and, possibly, to provide a greater chance of recovering live virus for culture. When patients cough or sneeze, they expel respiratory droplets, which can travel several meters. Evaporation leads to droplet nuclei that are transportable by air currents, although drying may reduce infectivity. Previous studies of human coronavirus 229E (a common cold virus) showed that experimental aerosols could persist and retain viability for as long as 6 days at 20\u040aC and 50% relative humidity [20] . These conditions are representative of typical indoor environments. Although such experiments may overestimate the ability of a virus to survive in real environments (for example, they do not take into account air turnover rates in buildings), one would expect SARS CoV to have similar airborne survival characteristics, given that these viruses are in the same family and have broadly similar physicochemical properties.",
