The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Relevant medical and ocular histories, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, glaucoma, high myopia, previous ocular disease, and surgery, were recorded. Patients were assessed with a comprehensive ocular examination including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) by noncontact tonometer ([NCT] Xpert Noncontact Tonometer Plus; Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, New York, New York, USA), slit-lamp, and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy at baseline and at 2 months and 3 months. Use of personal protective equipment recommended by the Infectious Control Unit of the hospital was strictly maintained throughout the examination.",

No visual acuity loss, cataract progression, or anterior uveitis was observed. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients, with particular emphasis on any vitritis, retinitis, vaculitis, central serous chorioretinopathy, and changes at the optic disks. For the 2 patients with mildly elevated IOP in both eyes, the IOP was persistent elevated at the same level 2 months after corticosteroid cessation. There was no statistically significant difference between IOP at baseline and month 2 (t test, P = .904; SPSS 10.0 for Windows). At month 3, when no patient was on corticosteroid, the mean IOP was 13.8 \u00b1 2.9 mm Hg. There was only one case with IOP greater than 21.0 mm Hg. This patient had an IOP of 22.0 mm Hg at month 3 and IOP of 21.3 mm Hg at baseline. None of the cases had an IOP rise of at least 2.0 mm Hg compared with the baseline IOP.",
