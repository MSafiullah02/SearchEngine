We cared for several patients from our medical community, including the mother of a surgical medical assistant, the wife of a surgeon, the father of a surgeon, and the brother of an anesthesiologist. This created unique challenges and required that we reassure medical colleagues that we had sufficient knowledge, skill, and dedication to care for their loved one. Preliminary reports from our hospital have not found any worse outcomes associated with treatment in a non-intensivist staffed unit. The worst part of the pandemic has been the isolation of patients from their families. No amount of technology can replace the comfort of a loved one\u2019s presence during illness and death.",
