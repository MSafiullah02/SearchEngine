Since October 1997, BAL samples obtained from patients with hematological malignancies have been routinely stored at the hospital's diagnostic virology laboratory. For this retrospective study, 43 adults with hematological cancer who also had signs of pneumonia and radiographic pulmonary abnormalities and whose BAL samples had been stored were considered assessable. We reviewed the patients' charts to obtain the following information: underlying disease and therapy; antimicrobial treatment; additional bacterial, fungal, and viral culture data or antigen testing results; serologic data; clinical features; and outcome. A total of 43 BAL specimens from these patients had been investigated routinely for the following pathogens: bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, herpesviruses, and respiratory viruses (influenza viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, picornaviruses, and adenoviruses). Nose-throat (NT) swabs had also been obtained from 17 of these 43 patients within 1 week of the BAL sample. These NT swabs had also been stored after conventional testing for respiratory viruses. In addition, paired serum samples had been obtained from 29 patients for detection of atypical bacterial (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia species, Legionella species) and respiratory virus pathogens.",
