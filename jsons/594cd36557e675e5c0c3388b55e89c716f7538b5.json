Among these, 151 respiratory viruses were detected. Several viruses cocirculated within the same period; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common (45.45%), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV; 26%), influenza type B (26%), human metapneumovirus (24.6%), and human coronavirus (HCoV; 24.6%). Coinfections were detected in 55% of the subjects, and most of them involved RSV with one or more other viruses. A strong correlation was found between PIV, Flu (influenza of any type), RSV, and HCoV with the incidence of coinfections. RSV was associated with lower respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, bronchitis, and bacteremia. HCoV was associated with bronchiolitis; rhinovirus was associated with hospital admission. Conclusion: Patients with pediatric cancer have a high burden of respiratory viral infections and a high incidence of coinfections. Molecular diagnostics can improve management of febrile episodes and reduce antibiotic use.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Defects in innate and adaptive immunity 3 coupled with damage in the mucosal membrane and frequent exposure to a healthcare environment contribute to increased morbidity 7, 8 and mortality of respiratory infections in these patients. 2, 3, 7, [9] [10] [11] In healthy children, respiratory viruses are usually confined to the upper respiratory tract; in immunocompromised patients, progression to the lower respiratory tract is a more frequent and feared complication. 2, 12, 13 Despite advances in cancer therapy and outcomes during the last decade, respiratory viral infections and complications are frequent barriers to the success of antineoplastic treatment. 11, 12, 14 Respiratory infections are major causes of febrile episodes in patients with pediatric cancer. 3 These patients often are initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover serious bacterial diseases, leading to unnecessary increased exposure to antibiotics and the potential emergence of antibiotic resistance. 3, 15, 16 Accurate respiratory viral diagnosis and early access to treatment can improve outcomes, allow the prompt initiation of infection control measures, and limit antibiotic use. 10 Molecular diagnostic assays for respiratory virus detection and identification are becoming increasingly popular because they outperform traditional viral detection methods, such as antigen detection and cell culture-based assays in terms of speed, efficiency, specificity, and sensitivity. 10, 12 Altogether, these facts highlight the need for surveillance studies that utilize molecular diagnostic tools to elucidate the role of viral pathogens during respiratory infections, their risk factors, and outcomes. 12, [17] [18] [19] Epidemiological studies of respiratory viral infections in patients with pediatric cancer in low-resource settings are scarce. 3, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] The main purpose of this study was to screen for viral etiologic agents and associated risk factors and complications during respiratory infections in patients with pediatric cancer in Lebanon to address the joint need for surveillance studies using molecular diagnostic tools and additional studies of respiratory infections in developing countries. Extraction controls were screened to exclude cross-contamination during extraction. Flu A-positive samples were further subtyped via real-time PCR using the CDC-established protocol. RSV-positive samples were subtyped by conventional PCR followed by 1.5% gel electrophoresis using RSV-A and RSV-B primers specific for the G gene hypervariable region. 22, 23 ",

The \u03c72 test and odds ratio were computed to test the association between the categorical variables. All variables that were statistically associated with severe outcomes in the univariate models were included in multivariate logistic regression using the backward selection method; a significance level of 0.10 or less was required for a covariate to stay in the model. Then, odds ratio estimates with P values for tested variables were monitored after adjusting for age and sex. Similarly, the correlation analysis between variables was also included, and correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of the relationship between different variables. For these tests, P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 software.",

However, other studies in immunocompetent children found that coinfection was associated with more-severe lower respiratory tract infection and a higher risk of hospital admission than monoinfection was. 25,26 A meta-analysis of 21 studies involving 4280 immunocompetent patients found no evidence of increased severity as a result of coinfections compared with monoinfections. 27 Therefore, the clinical implications of respiratory viral coinfections need further investigation.

A study by Soderman et al 19 suggested that the shedding time of Flu, HMPV, RSV, and PIV is limited, and virus clearance was evident at a median follow-up time of 28 days. In contrast, the same RhV genotypes were detected from subsequent follow-up samples after 12 to 51 days, and some RhV-positive patients reported the appearance of respiratory symptoms 6 days or more before fever onset, indicating the possibility of prolonged shedding. Longitudinal studies whereby patients are screened on a weekly basis until no detection of a given virus is confirmed are required to determine the frequency of repeated infections vs persistent infections among children with cancer and their impact on patient outcomes. A molecular approach using sequencing of the sequentially detected viruses should allow a better understanding of the extent of virus evolution in these patients. The current study had several limitations, including the heterogeneity of cancer types in the studied population and the absence of a control group of patients with asymptomatic cancer. Another limitation was the lack of follow-up sampling to monitor the status of the detected respiratory virus and differentiate between prolonged vs persistent shedding. Moreover, human bocavirus and enteroviruses were can lead to serious complications and might become life-threatening, particularly in the context of weakened immune systems of patients with cancer. Few studies have investigated respiratory infections in patients with cancer, especially in children. In this study, we detected a high incidence of respiratory viral infections among children with cancer in Lebanon via real-time PCR. The results demonstrate the usefulness of real-time PCR in diagnosis and, therefore, in guiding proper clinical management and infection control. Preventing respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients, including those with cancer, is critical for protecting these patients, especially given the absence of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs for most of these viruses.",

Such outcomes would be effectively reduced by annual vaccinations, which are now recommended for patients and their health care providers. In this study, infection with influenza A and/or B was detected in 26.9% (24/89) of the cases. The vaccination rate among the children \u22656 months (recommended age for the vaccine) with febrile episodes was44.7%, which is considered to be low for this high-risk population.Therefore, emphasizing the importance of attaining universal vaccination in this population and their caregivers is likely to improve patient outcomes by preventing influenza infection.The duration of shedding and frequency of recurrent virus detections have not been thoroughly investigated in immunocompromised children.19,35 In the current study, 17 of the 67 patients had repeated detection of respiratory viruses in subsequent febrile episodes, and half of these patients had repeated detection of the same virus. RSV was the most common virus detected repeatedly in subsequent febrile episodes. It was not possible to rule out whether these infections were persistent or repeated infections because this study only included patients in whom a febrile episode developed rather than monitoring all patients on a routine basis.
