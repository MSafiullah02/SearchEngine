While different strains may have some antigenic variability, all strains elicit cross-reactive seropositivity and thus form a single serotype (Clark, 1993; El-Ghorr et al., 1989). The virus is an important livestock pathogen causing effects on animal welfare as well as the economy (Lathrop et al., 2000a). It causes diarrhea and respiratory disease in calves, as well as winter dysentery in adult cattle (Boileau and Kapil, 2010; Ksiazek et al., 2003). Transmission of BCoV is mainly through respiratory or fecal-oral routes (Clark, 1993), infecting the respiratory (nasal, tracheal, and lung) and intestinal (villi and crypts of the ileum and colon) epithelial cells (Park et al., 2007). When infected with BCoV, within-herd transmission is generally rapid and infected animals display diverse clinical signs including diarrhea with or without blood, fever, and respiratory signs, which range from none to severe (Clark, 1993; Boileau and Kapil, 2010).",

Briefly, Vero B4 cells were co-transfected with pCG1 plasmids bearing Human coronavirus OC43 spike proteins. After overnight transfection, cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin to detach them in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C and re-suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) in 10 % Foetal Calf Serum (FCS). Aliquots of cells were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and washed twice with 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Fifty microliters (50 \u03bcl) of cell pellets were spotted on 12 well slides by dispensing and immediately aspirating, allowing 2 s interval between spotting. The cells were fixed using ice cold acetone/methanol (1:1), dried at ambient temperature, and kept at 4 \u00b0C after drying for 20 min. To conduct the assay, 45 \u03bcl of protein-free blocking solution (Roti\u00ae-Block, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was first added to each of the 12 spotted fields on the slide and incubated at room temperature in a humid box for 30 min, followed by rinsing with 1X tween-free PBS. After inactivation at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, sera to be tested were diluted 1:100 in a 1X concentration of the protein-free blocking solution. Subsequently, 30 \u03bcl of the diluted sera was applied on each of the spotted area and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in a humid chamber, followed by rinsing with 0.1 % tween in 1X PBS. Secondary antibody detection was done by the Alexa488 fluorescent reporter-conjugated goat anti-bovine, donkey anti-sheep, and donkey anti-goat IgG antibodies for cattle, sheep, and goat BCoV IgG respectively.",

BCoV shares recent common ancestry with human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (Vijgen et al., 2006) and the two are serologically closely related to the extent that HCoV-OC43 is often used as a proxy in serological testing as previously described where specific proteins of BCoV were not available for serological testing or when National legislation restricts the use of certain livestock pathogens (Reusken et al., 2013b; Meyer et al., 2014). In most African countries such as Ghana, diverse farm animals live in close contact that poses a risk of cross-species infection. Indeed, we found seropositivity against BCoV not only among cattle (55.8 %) but also among sheep and goats at 25.8 % and 43.1 % prevalence rates, respectively. This prevalence was predominant among animals from the Volta region of Ghana. Cattle presented with significantly higher prevalence of BCoV compared to sheep and goats.",

(2010) who reported that large herd size is a risk factor for BCoV infections in dairy cattle. This may be due to poor biosecurity especially among farms with larger herd size in Ghana, and also due to the close contact between animals in these farms which could potentiate the transmission of BCoV compared to farms with small herd size (Beaudeau et al., 2010; Ohlson et al., 2010).",
