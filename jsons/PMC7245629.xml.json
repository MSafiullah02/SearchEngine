ARDS pathophysiology is based on a triad of alveolar-capillary membrane injury, high permeability alveolar oedema, and migration of inflammatory cells [3]. This triad is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Therefore, arterial hypoxemia and bilateral opacities on chest imaging following various clinical insults are used as clinical surrogates in the American European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition and the newer Berlin definition of ARDS [4, 5].",

They found that 12 biomarkers in plasma were associated with mortality in patients with ARDS. However, a major limitation of their meta-analysis is that these biomarkers were tested in univariate analyses without considering confounders as disease severity scores. Given the high univariate ORs as compared to the multivariate ORs found in this systematic review, the performance of these biomarkers is likely to be overestimated. Jabaudon et al. [109] found in an individual patient data meta-analysis that high concentrations of plasma RAGE were associated with 90-day mortality independent of driving pressure or tidal volume. However, they could not correct for disease severity score as these differed between studies. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis on multivariate data because of heterogeneity of the included studies, as transformation of raw data, biomarker concentration cut-offs, time until outcome, and the variables used in the multivariate analyses varied widely between studies. This could be an incentive to standardize the presentation of ARDS biomarker research in terms of statistics and outcome for future analyses or to make individual patient data accessible.",

Previously, Terpstra et al. [19] proposed that biomarkers for ARDS development were correlated with alveolar tissue injury, whereas biomarkers for ARDS mortality correlated more with inflammation. In this systematic review, we found that the majority of biomarkers tested for both ARDS development and mortality were surrogates for inflammation. However, following qualitative inspection, biomarkers for inflammation were not evidently associated with either ARDS development or mortality. In contrast, markers for alveolar epithelial injury (plasma RAGE and SpD) and endothelial permeability (plasma Ang-2) seem to be associated with ARDS development. Therefore, we should consider how we intend to use (a set of) biomarkers in patients with ARDS.",

Half of plasma biomarkers for ARDS development included in this study reflected inflammation. An increase in inflammatory biomarkers is known to correlate with increased disease severity scores [71, 97, 110]. In turn, the majority of studies in this review found significantly higher disease severity scores in the critically ill patients that eventually developed ARDS. Thus, plasma biomarkers for inflammation rather represented an estimation of disease severity and its associated increased risk for the development of ARDS. In addition, biomarkers for inflammation in plasma lack the specificity to diagnose ARDS, as they are unlikely to differentiate sepsis with ARDS from sepsis without ARDS. In contrast, locally sampled biomarkers for inflammation, for example in the alveolar space, could potentially diagnose ARDS [111]. Biomarkers used for ARDS mortality or for the identification of less heterogeneous ARDS phenotypes do not require to be ARDS specific, provided that they adequately predict or stratify patients with ARDS.",

Therefore, it is necessary to identify homogeneous ARDS phenotypes that are more likely to respond to an intervention. This is known as predictive enrichment [112]. Previously, patients with ARDS have been successfully stratified based on clinical parameters, such as ARDS risk factor (pulmonary or extra-pulmonary) or PaO2/FiO2 ratio [113]. ARDS biomarkers could be used to stratify patients with ARDS based on biological or pathophysiological phenotype. For example, trials of novel therapies designed to influence vascular permeability may benefit from preferentially enrolling patients with high Ang-2 concentrations. Recently, clinical parameters have been combined with a set of biomarkers in a retrospective latent class analysis. In three trials, two distinct phenotypes were found: hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory ARDS [16, 17]. Patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype had reduced mortality rate with higher positive end-expiratory pressures and with liberal fluid treatment, whereas the trials themselves found no difference between the entire intervention groups. The next step is to validate the identification of ARDS phenotypes based on latent class analysis in prospective studies. An adequate combination of biomarkers and clinical parameters remains to be established. Until now, there is no list of biomarkers that are associated with ARDS development or mortality independently of clinical parameters. This systematic review may guide the selection of ARDS biomarkers used for predictive enrichment.",

            "text": "This systematic review has limitations. First, the intent of this systematic review was to perform a meta-analysis. However, we decided not to perform a meta-analysis, as the biomarker data handling and outcomes varied widely among studies, and pooling would have resulted in a non-informative estimate [21]. Arguably, this is a positive result, as it refrains us from focusing on the few biomarkers that could be pooled in a meta-analysis and guides us into a direction were multiple biomarkers combined with other parameters are of interest. In a heterogeneous syndrome as ARDS, the one biomarker probably does not exist. Second, the first sampling moment varied between sampling at ICU admission until 72 h following ICU admission. Initially, ARDS is characterized by an exudative phase followed by a second proliferative phase and late fibrotic phase [3]. The moment of sampling likely influences biomarker concentrations, as both alveolar membrane injury and inflammation increase during the exudative phase. This is also seen in six biomarkers that have been measured at separate days, resulting in a significant change in adjusted OR for four biomarkers (Table 4) [61, 98, 104, 105]. Third, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the independent risk effects of biomarkers measured in various bodily fluid compartments. However, the majority of studies assessed biomarkers in plasma. It remains to be answered whether other bodily fluid compartments, for example from the airways and alveolar space themselves, might outperform ARDS biomarkers in plasma, especially for ARDS development. Fourth, all studies found in this systematic review used a clinical definition of ARDS as standard for ARDS diagnosis. Given the poor correlation between a clinical diagnosis and a histopathological diagnosis of ARDS, these studies are diagnosing a very heterogeneous disease syndrome [7\u201310]. In order to actually evaluate ARDS development, biomarkers should be compared to a histopathological image of DAD, although acquiring histology poses great challenges by itself. Fifth, as only biomarkers assessed in multivariate analyses were included in this study, new promising biomarkers evaluated in univariate analyses were excluded from this study. Lastly, non-significant biomarkers in multivariate analyses were more likely not to be reported, although some studies report non-significant results nonetheless.",
