Serologic methods can more accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates from 1-4% of confirmed cases 1 . The current case definition for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR-positive pharyngeal or respiratory specimens, with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk. However, this case definition likely underestimates true prevalence, as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested, and testing by PCR of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens is only around 60-80% sensitive depending on sampling location and technique and the patient's viral load 2 . Widespread testing within the United States is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories. Therefore, the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely much higher than currently reported case numbers would indicate. Serology can play an important role in defining the true prevalence of COVID-19, particularly for subclinical infection 2 . Early studies of serology demonstrate high sensitivity to detect confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with antibodies to virus detected approximately 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset 3 . Unlike PCR positivity, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable throughout the disease course and persist indefinitely 4 . Multiple serologic tests have been developed for COVID-19 5 including a recently FDA-approved lateral flow assay. However, these tests are limited to detection of antibodies against one or two antigens, and cross-reactivity with antibodies to other human coronaviruses that are present in all adults 6 is currently unknown. Prior use of serology for detection of emerging coronaviruses focused on antibodies against the spike (S) protein, particularly the S1 domain, and the nucleocapsid protein (NP) 7 . However, the optimal set of antigens to detect strain-specific coronavirus antibodies remains unknown. Protein microarray technology can be used to detect antibodies of multiple isotypes against hundreds of antigens in a high throughput manner 8, 9 so is well suited to serologic surveillance studies. This technology, which has previously been applied to other emerging coronaviruses 10 , is based on detection of binding antibodies, which are wellcorrelated with neutralizing antibodies 11 but do not require viral culture in biosafety level 3 facilities. Recently, our group developed a coronavirus antigen microarray (CoVAM) that includes antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and tested it on human sera collected prior to the pandemic to demonstrate low cross-reactivity with antibodies from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly for the S1 domain 2 . Here, we further validate this methodology using convalescent blood specimens from COVID-19 cases confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.",

Two sera were obtained as de-identified discarded laboratory specimens from acute COVID-19 patients from the Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital (OHSU), Portland, OR. These were sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from informed consent and IRB approval under condition of patient anonymity. An additional two sera were obtained from recovered COVID patients at Vitalant Research Institute in San Francisco, CA under an IRB approved protocol. One convalescent plasma was obtained by Cerus Corporation after isolation from a large-volume apheresis collection following standard protocol from a documented recovered COVID-19 blood donor who was more than 28 days post symptomatic. Four plasma samples were obtained from outpatients of the University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. These patients were screened in accordance with Swiss regulations on blood donation and approved as plasma donors according to the Blood Transfusion Service of the Swiss Red Cross with informed consent. These donors were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests. At time of plasma donation, each had two negative nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in blood, and they were qualified as plasma donors. Plasma was collected from these convalescent donors at the Regional Blood Transfusion Service of the Swiss Red Cross in accordance with national regulations. A total of 144 de-identified pre-pandemic control sera used in this study were collected between November 2018 and May 2019 for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in the Eastern United States were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases using questionnaires and RT-qPCR, so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections, built environment, and immunologic phenotypes 12 . Electronic informed consents including future research use authorization was obtained under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards Table 2 ). These antigens were provided by Sino Biological U.S. Inc. (Wayne, PA) as either catalog products or custom synthesis service products. The antigens were printed onto microarrays, probed with human sera, and analyzed as previously described 9, 13, 14 . Briefly, lyophilized antigens were reconstituted with sterile water to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL bringing protein solution to 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and printing buffer was added. Antigens were then printed onto ONCYTE AVID nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) using an OmniGrid 100 microarray printer (GeneMachines). The microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1:100 in 1x Protein Array Blocking Buffer (GVS Life Sciences, Sanford, ME) overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed with T-TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 in ddH2O adjusted to pH 7.5 and filtered) 3 times for 5 minutes each. A mixture of human IgG and IgA secondary antibodies conjugated to quantum dot fluorophores Q800 and Q585 respectively was applied to each of the microarray pads and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, and pads were then washed with T-TBS 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried. The slides were imaged using ArrayCam imager (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence. Non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control. Mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysis.",

The fluorescence signal for each spot was determined by its signal intensity subtracted by the background fluorescence. Antigens containing a human Fc tag were removed from the analysis, as the secondary antibodies used for quantification are known to bind to human Fc; non-human Fc tag did not interfere with the assay. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). MFI was normalized by the quantile normalization method using the proprocessCore package (version 1.48.0). As a target for normalization, a vector containing the median MFI for IgG or IgA was constructed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the IgA and IgG reactivity measured as MFI. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons were used to compare the mean differences between groups. In order to rank the antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV for performance in discriminating the positive and negative groups, the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) values for each antigen were calculated by comparing positive and negative specimens using the pROC package (version 1.16.2). For this, the samples were randomly partitioned into two groups, at a ratio of 75%/25%, using the caret package (version 6.9-86). The group with 75% of the samples was used to create a regression model using the glm function form the stats package (version 3.6.3). The 25% subset was used to predict the outcome of each sample being classified as negative or positive using the stat package and the AUC value calculated. This process was repeated for one thousand times and the final AUC values calculated as the median values of all repetitions. Next, in order to evaluate the benefit of combining antigens for an increased prediction performance, the top ranked antigens, using a cutoff point of auc = 0.85, were combined into groups of all possible combinations from 2 to 4 antigens using the combinat package (version 0.0-8). Again, the auc values for each combination were calculated using the same procedure as for individual antigens and the calculated AUCs are representative of the median AUC from one thousand repetitions. The optimal sensitivity and specificity for each antigen and combination of antigens was calculated based on the maximum Youden Index. Data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package (version 3.3.0) or pROC package.",

As shown in the heatmap (Figure 1 ), the positive group is highly reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This is more evident for the IgG reactivity then for IgA. The negative controls do not show high reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV antigens despite showing high reactivity to the common cold coronavirus antigens. With respect to specific antigens, positive group displays high IgG reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP, S2, and S1+S2 antigens and to a lesser degree SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Figure 2 ). The positive group also demonstrates high IgG cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV NP and MERS-CoV S2 and S1+S2 antigens, while the negative group demonstrates low cross-reactivity with S1+S2 and S2 antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and no cross-reactivity against other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The IgA reactivity profile is shown on Figure 3 . Overall, IgA seems to follow a similar pattern to IgG, with higher reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP, S2 and S1+S2, cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV NP, but no crossreactivity to the MERS-CoV antigens. The two groups do not differ significantly in reactivity to antigens from common cold coronaviruses or other respiratory viruses for either IgG or IgA. The differences between the groups appear to be restricted to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and cross-reactive SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antigens, so these antigens from epidemic coronaviruses were the focus of subsequent analysis.",

            "text": "This study reveals several insights into the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antibody profiles of na\u00efve individuals include high IgG reactivity to common cold coronaviruses with low-level cross-reactivity with S2 domains from SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemic coronaviruses, which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence homology and previously observed serologic cross-reactivity 15 between S2 domains of betacoronaviruses, a group that includes SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and common cold coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. This low-level cross-reactivity occurs in approximately 7% of unexposed individuals (Figure 1) , which leads to hypotheses regarding whether these individuals differ in COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. However, na\u00efve individuals do not show cross-reactivity to other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Even for the nucleocapsid protein, which also has high sequence homology between betacoronaviruses, cross-reactivity is only seen between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and not with MERS-CoV or common cold coronaviruses. In addition, the quantitative difference between high antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S2 in the positive group and low-level antibody cross-reactivity in the negative group is large enough that these antigens still discriminate these groups with high significance. This study also informs antigen selection and design for population surveillance and clinical diagnostic assays and vaccine development. The optimal assay to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera from pre-pandemic sera is a combination of 2 antigens that includes S2 and NP. As an individual antigen, the S2 demonstrates cross-reactivity with negative control sera which leads to low specificity, but this antigen adds predictive power when combined with the more specific NP antigen. The observation that unexposed individuals with antibodies to common cold coronaviruses do not show crossreactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP dispels concerns that the high sequence homology of this protein across betacoronaviruses would impair its performance as a diagnostic antigen. The low-level antibody cross-reactivity of a subset of unexposed ndividuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein containing S2 domain may not preclude its use as a diagnostic antigen given large quantitative difference in antibody reactivity between positive and negative groups, but this cross-reactivity may influence response to vaccination with spike protein antigens containing the S2 domain in this subset of individuals. The coronavirus antigen microarray can be useful both as an epidemiologic tool and as a research tool. The high throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody profiles that reliably distinguish COVID-19 cases from negative controls can be applied to large-scale population surveillance studies for a more accurate estimation of the true prevalence of disease than can be achieved with symptom-based PCR testing. In addition, detection of these antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations can provide validation prior to clinical use for passive immunization. The variation in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among acute and convalescent donors suggests that epitope characterization of convalescent donor plasma will be informative for evaluation of passive immune therapy efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 16 can be more closely studied by analyzing both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibody responses, particularly to test hypotheses regarding antibody-dependent enhancement with critical implications for vaccine development 17 .",
