The side chains of I172, V176, I180, and A183 in the C terminus of HR1 peptide produce a 3-4-4-4-3 spacing rather than the expected 3-4-3-4-3. This skip was predicated to be conserved in paramyxovirus and also found in hRSV F structure [34]. In MuV fusion core structure, all the heptad repeats also exhibit the typical 3-4-4-4-3 spacing predicated by LearnCoil-VMF program [35]. In the core structure studied here, I175 faces the outside of the trimer and holds d position in heptad repeats of HR1 region, while M176 at the e position faces the center of the central coiled-coil (Fig. 4\nA). Sequence alignment shows that residues in the same position in other paramyxovirus fusion proteins as I175 in MuV F are almost all hydrophilic (Val in SV5 F) and the next residues are all hydrophobic and highly conserved (Fig. 4B). This arrangement will lead to increase in spacing that will make the central coiled-coil more stable within the hydrophobic interaction and the outer side of the fusion core more hydrophilic in solution. Expectably, in MuV F structure, the residues in this region also form typical 4-4 spacing because residue I175 is at the d position and faces outside. We can consider that the skip pattern is conserved in paramyxovirus fusion proteins for executing fusion functions successfully.",

            "text": "Our structure studied here shows that HR2 of MuV fusion core has one additional extended region at the C terminus not observed in SV5 and HRSV C peptide. This additional extended region contains only four residues (SVNV). The extended chains can also be found at the N terminus of SV5 and HRSV HR2 regions. We can find a motif termed O\u2013X\u2013O in which O represents hydrophobic residues and X represents any residues, especially hydrophilic [17]. V477-N478-V479 in MuV F, L442-S443-I444 and L447-D448-I449 in SV5 F, L481-V482-F483 in HRSV F all belong to O\u2013X\u2013O motifs. The O\u2013X\u2013O pattern of hydrophobic residues is amphipathic when in an extended conformation but not in the context of \u03b1-helix. Therefore, this section of HR2 packs as an extended strand against the hydrophobic grooves between the HR1 helices. In these three structures, the distance between two hydrophobic residues in the O\u2013X\u2013O motifs is almost equal to 5.4 \u00c5 which is also the distance between the two adjacent turns in an \u03b1-helix. Thus, the two hydrophobic residues (O residues) could exactly pack against the grooves of the central coiled-coil formed by three HR1 helices just like residues at the a and d positions in normal heptad repeat regions of HR2. This compatibility of HR2 segments makes the fusion core more stable in solvent because most of the hydrophobic residues in HR2 regions are packed against the central coiled-coil and leave the hydrophilic residues faced the solvent. This pattern also explains why not all residues in HR2 of viral fusion proteins form \u03b1-helix and why HR1 peptides of these fusion proteins are highly conserved but HR2 peptides are always different in their three-dimensional conformations. Compatibilities of HR1 and HR2 segments we discussed here both indicate the basic rule for the formation of viral fusion core.",

Similar to HIV gp41, MuV F1 likely has distinct conformational states, including the native state, the prehairpin intermediate, and fusion-active hairpin state [3].
