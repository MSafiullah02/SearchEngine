Satisfaction of one\u2019s needs and wants increases happiness but is largely irrelevant to meaningfulness. Happiness is largely oriented toward the present, whereas meaningfulness involves integrating the past, present, and future. Happiness is frequently linked to being a taker rather than a giver. Meaningfulness is associated with being a giver rather than a taker. Personal identity and self-expression contribute to meaning but not to happiness. Action undertaken for others out of genuine compassion results in deep and lasting satisfaction because contributing to a cause beyond the personal ego generates happiness, a sense of meaning, and a feeling that one\u2019s wants have been satisfied.",

If one\u2019s thoughts, words, and action are in dissonance, one experiences subjective unhappiness even if objectively fulfilled in all factors of satisfaction such as health, wealth, social standing, and entertainment. An individual who experiences \u2018cognitive dissonance\u20197 tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, becoming motivated to try to reduce this discomfort and to actively avoid situations and information deemed likely to increase the discomfort. Selfish behavior often causes dissonance, as it goes against the inherent human trait of cooperation as well as the religious values and social mores with which many are raised. Unless the individual becomes conscious of the cause of such discomfort, he/she will avoid situations and/or information that highlights the conflict between belief and action, rather than changing the related behavior (Harmon-Jones and Mills 2019).",

The individual can get the same flow of so-called pleasure hormones by alleviating someone else\u2019s suffering as from buying a new gadget or indulging in chocolate. Along the same lines, when the individual feels compassion for others, this emotion generates physiological changes conducive to making the person stay and help. This functions as an opposite to the fight-or-flight response that is activated when we feel threatened. Preparation to fight a threat or flee causes the heart and breathing rates to increase. This is an automatic reaction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), a loose association of glands, organs, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems. These systems play a vital role in regulating blood flow and breathing patterns for different kinds of actions. An individual\u2019s heart rate does not rise upon perceiving others\u2019 suffering, but rather falls below the baseline levels, preparing him/her not to fight or flee, but to approach and soothe.",

Additionally, yoga has been proven a relevant tool in addiction treatment. Studies have shown that increasing awareness of one\u2019s body through conscious exercise, balanced nutrition, and breathing exercises help reduce anxiety, depression, and chronic pain while improving sleep patterns and overall well-being (Woodyard 2011). Certain practices involving several of the five senses, such as dance, are effective at increasing subjective well-being, mood, body image, and interpersonal competence while decreasing clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety (Koch et al. 2014).",

It is justified in various ways and rooted in multiple explanations. Beyond the immediate benefit of a positive action for the beneficiary, one might also consider the possibility of receiving reciprocal positive action. An individual\u2019s thoughts, words, and actions carry the seeds of his/her future (Krishan 1988) because everything generates energy that returns in kind. When one chooses to invest energy in others\u2019 happiness, the fruit of one\u2019s karma is happiness and success. Selfless service is a win-win-win-win.

Today\u2019s concept of dualism is closely associated with Rene Descartes and the sixteenth century. Descartes held that the mind is a non-physical, and therefore non-spatial, substance. He identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished it from the brain as the seat of intelligence. However, for some time now, there has been rising interest in the complementarity of both.

However, there are degrees and variations that derive from the individual\u2019s situation. While the fundamental needs, rights, and responsibilities are the same for all human beings, the level of responsibility and the weight of certain needs depend on individual circumstances. In this logic of interdependence between rights and responsibility, of have and have not, the rights of the disadvantaged person acquire an expanded dimension. This dimension pertains to a disadvantaged person\u2019s entitlement to a change that would restore the functionality of an unfulfilled right; this dimension correlates with a responsibility dimension that is linked to the privileges the more fortunate hold. The intensity of this responsibility dimension increases with the means of its holder. Having or acquiring possessions, power or skills, amplifies the responsibility of the privileged individual to use this advantage for the benefit of others. This inherent responsibility is not limited to the conventional pair of duty-bearer and rights-holder and cannot be transferred to the government or an institution (Walther 2014).",

Drawing further on this example of humans and nature, studies show that individuals who live in close connection with nature report greater self-acceptance, increased social integration, more positive emotions, and greater life satisfaction (Mayer et al. 2009; Howell et al. 2011). Humans who have a close relationship with nature understand the immensity of the World and yet are able to relate this with feelings of personal autonomy, purpose, and growth. Indeed, the prevailing disconnect between many humans and the natural World appears to go against biophilia, humans\u2019 innate need to interact with other life-forms such as plants and animals (Wilson 1984).

People have many different needs, ranging from food and shelter, through safety, personal growth, and love, to approval from others, self-worth, and creativity (Hultman 1979). A person\u2019s belief system conditions the behavior one undertakes to meet these needs. Beliefs are the sum total of a person\u2019s experiences. They include all the lessons of life, including teachings about how to perceive the World and about what is right or wrong, good or bad. Over time, political systems tend to institutionalize the dominant values. Consequently, social innovation usually comes from sources outside of the prevailing governance system, such as social movements created by individuals (Castells 1972). It is crucial to instill in individuals the belief in the fundamental importance of social responsibility and kindness to personal and collective prosperity from a young age. Children must grow up in an environment that nurtures their instinct for cooperation. Behaviors derived from this understanding result in a certain type of experience that further affirms this initial perspective. As this behavior is maintained and pursued over time, it shapes the neural set-up of the organism. In this context, the organism is the physical stage of the individual\u2019s presence in Society, and our neural set-up is both cause and consequence of our worldview.",

One reason for this open-eyed blindness to our circumstances may be seen in an inadequate comprehension of the deep-seated impact of inequality on individuals and Society at large (Vandermoortele 2019)\n",

Awareness of the interplay between internal and external factors is an important condition for the first effective step from reflection to action, which involves thinking about reflexivity or action. The one who thinks will act to implement the learning that has resulted from that reflection and from the reactions of others to this change of direction (Soros 1987). This step from mind to materialization is important because the ideas generated by the process of reflection do not in and of themselves change how we act. It also matters for the one who thinks and acts, because through the physical execution of the idea, new experiences arise that result in new memories that will guide future behavior. With each new way of \u2018doing\u2019, a different set of neurons is activated. Repetition gradually results in a modification of the existing mental \u2018hardware\u2019 and the prevailing neuropathways change (Doidge 2007). As the physical act is performed, pursuing the new mental and behavioral path becomes easier with each repetition. Eventually, this complementarity of mind and matter, of thought/belief and action, becomes permanent. Like a stone thrown into water causes ripples, a changed mindset changes the individual\u2019s behavior, which circles out toward his/her community, which is part of a country, which is part of the international community and Planet.

            "text": "From an evolutionary perspective, an organism is said to behave altruistically when its behavior benefits other organisms, at a cost to itself (Okasha 2003). These costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness. By behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself but boosts the number that other organisms are likely to produce. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday concept in which an action would only be called \u2018altruistic\u2019, if it was done with the conscious intention of helping others. In the biological sense, there is no such requirement.13 From a Darwinian perspective, the existence of altruism seems surprising, as it puts the one who behaves altruistically at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the one which behaves selfishly. Imagine that some members of a group of Vervet monkeys give alarm calls when they see predators, but others do not. By refusing to give an alarm call, a monkey can reduce the chance that it will be attacked, while at the same time benefiting from the alarm calls of others. However, natural selection does not favor those monkeys that do not give alarm calls over those that do. Altruistic behavior has shown that individuals who act in ways that appear to be contrary to their own interests while benefiting someone else have advantages for their genetically similar kin (McAndrew 2002).",

Gradualism is selection and variation that happens slowly. Over a short period of time, it is hard to notice. Small variations that fit an organism slightly better to its environment are selected for: a few more individuals with more of the helpful trait survive, and a few more with less of the helpful trait die. Very slowly, in small increments, over a long time, the population changes. Change is slow, constant, and consistent. In punctuated equilibrium, change comes in spurts. There is a period of very little change, and then one or a few huge changes occur, often through mutations in the genes of a few individuals. Mutations are random changes in the DNA that are not inherited from the previous generation but are passed on to generations that follow. Though mutations are often harmful, those that result in a new punctuated equilibrium are very helpful to the individuals in their environments. Because these mutations are so different and so helpful to the survival of those that have them, the proportion of individuals in the population who have the mutation/trait increases over a very short period. The species changes rapidly (in terms of evolutionary time) and then settles down again for a comparatively long period of little change. The transformation can be either the cause of mutations or other causes, such as huge and sudden changes in the environment that result in more rapid changes in the organisms through harsher selection.",

Scientists think that species with a shorter evolution like humans evolved mostly by punctuated equilibrium, while those with a longer evolution evolved mostly by gradualism. Both contrast with the theory of variable-speed evolution, which maintains that different species evolve at different rates, and that there is no reason to stress one rate of change over another.14 Maybe it was not either/or, but a combination, a mutation resulted in very distinct, stripe-like markings, which were then gradually \u2018polished up\u2019 into stripes because the marked tigers fared so much better in the survival game because they were much better disguised. The point here is that social transformation can be slow and gradual, like the shift that led many countries from the \u2018normality\u2019 of women as prime caretakers to the \u2018normality\u2019 of women as equal business partners; or it can be the result of drastic land-shifts, like the 2010 Earthquake in Haiti which led, for a short period in time, to the arousal of solidarity at mass scale.

Are we naturally selfish or do we evolve to be so, because of Society? It seems that neither position is entirely correct, and, more importantly, nothing is cast in stone. Evolutionary studies have found that genetics only partially influence altruistic behavior (Reuter et al. 2010), whereas progress in biology, genetics, and neuroscience offer ever more evidence of the features and neuro-circuitry of the human brain which underlie our behavior in the selfish\u2013selfless spectrum (Sonne and Gash 2018). Today\u2019s evidence supports the idea that altruistic potential is developed as a common feature in human populations. Comparing the critical features of the social brain along the scale from selfish\u2013selfless behavior, from unemotional psychopaths to zealous altruists who take extreme measures to help others, one can see common behavioral traits and functional neural features. Herein both, genetic inheritance and cognitive learning, play important roles. Studies of diverse population groups, including newborns, adopted children, incarcerated juveniles, twins, and mindfulness meditators, point to the central role of neuroplasticity and the dopaminergic reward systems in forming and reforming neural circuitry in response to personal experience, as well as cultural influences in determining behavior in the selfish\u2013selfless spectrum.",

When people perform behaviors associated with compassion (warm smiles, friendly hand gestures, affirmative forward leaning, etc.), their bodies produce more oxytocin, a hormone that promotes long-term bonds and commitments, as well as nurturing behavior\u2014like care for offspring. See Keltner (2004).Examples include Google, McKinsey, Nike, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo, Procter & Gamble, HBO, Deutsche Bank, AOL, Heinz, etc.For examples, see for burnout in organizational settings, Maslach and Jackson\u2019s (1984); Maslach et al. (1996); and for job burnout, Maslach et al. (2001); McCall and Salama (1999); and McCormack and Joseph (2012).Research has shown that individuals conform with a social norm as an automatic response to cues in their situation that focus their attention on this particular norm, on condition that they expect sufficiently many in the population to follow the rule. Experimental research supports norm compliance, and the manipulation of such expectations can radically change behavior. Most subjects have a conditional preference for following pro-social norms. See Bicchieri (2006).See Viktor Frankl, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning (1985), as well as version from Frankl with Lasch\u2019s translation (1992). Note\u2014Predecessors of Frankl argued that the driving force is pleasure (Carl Jung) or power (Adolf Adler).\u201cYears of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.\u201d Refer to Kashdan et al. (2008).Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, and performs an action that is contradictory to one or more beliefs, ideas, or values, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values. Refer to Festinger\u2019s (1962).Refer to information regarding Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen of Princeton University in Keltner (2004).Refer to James Rilling and Gregory Berns of Emory University in Keltner (2004).Breathing affects the brain through signals carried by the vagus nerve. Not only does the vagus nerve send signals down to the heart, but it also carries signals up into the brain stem. Vagus nerve signaling activates circuits for resting and relaxation, known as the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system is the opposite of the sympathetic nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight instinct. Slow breathing increases activity in the vagus nerve and pushes the brain toward parasympathetic activity. On the other hand, fast shallow breathing increases excitement and anxiety. See Korb (2015).Current thinking relies mostly on a dualistic perspective, whereby mind and body, individual and Society, tangible and intangible, inside and outside are separated. Mind\u2013body dualism considers the mind and the body as distinct and separable. It encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and between subject and object, and is contrasted with physicalism and enactivism. Aristoteles shared Plato\u2019s view of various souls and explained hierarchy with distinctive functions for plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only. For him, all three souls perish when the living organism dies, whereas for Plato the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body, which corresponds to the belief of reincarnation found in Buddhism and Hinduism.See in particular Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including Art. 22, Art. 26.Some of the most interesting examples of biological altruism are found among creatures that are (presumably) not capable of conscious thought at all, e.g., insects. For the biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed. Altruistic behavior is common throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with complex social structures. For example, vampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members of their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not starve. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in raising its young from other \u2018helper\u2019 birds, who protect the nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. In social insect colonies (ants, wasps, bees, and termites), sterile workers devote their whole lives to caring for the queen, constructing and protecting the nest, foraging for food, and tending the larvae.While Darwin is mostly quoted as seeing evolution as long, slow, and gradual, it should be noted that he did not put everything in the same box of speed. In the first edition of On the Origin of Species, Darwin stated that \u2018Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree\u2019; he refined this in the fifth edition writing that \u2018the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form\u2019.
