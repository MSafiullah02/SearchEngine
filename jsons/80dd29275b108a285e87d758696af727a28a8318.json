According to recent reports, most of COVID-19 patients have an incubation period of 3 to 7 days. 2 Fever, cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms, whereas nasal congestion, runny and diarrhea are only noted in a small part of the patients. 3 Severe cases might rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis and bleeding and coagulation dysfunction. 4 It should be noted that some of COVID-19 patients only had mild atypical symptoms initially, even for severe and critical cases. 5 The chest computed tomography of COVID-19 patients were characterized by the ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing. 6 For laboratory test, it was reported that most of patients had lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. 7 However, the above-mentioned clinical and laboratory characteristics are not easily distinguishable from pneumonia induced by infection with other common respiratory tract pathogens.",

Our study provided robust evidences that: 1) the acute antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 infection patient is very similar to many other acute viral infections; 2) the serological testing can be a powerful approach in achieving timely diagnosis; and 3) the total antibody is more sensitive than IgM and IgG for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Besides, epidemiological studies could be conducted using immunoassays. Additional, it can play an important role in searching potential animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 using Ab-ELISA because the double-sandwich method makes it free from species restriction. It has been less than three months since the SARS-CoV-2 first invaded humans, and the prevalence of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is nearly zero. Therefore, at least during the current outbreak which is likely to continue to May or June 2020, seropositive individuals could be a probably preceding infector. During this short-period, the total antibody could be considered as a recent infection marker similar as IgM. As the higher sensitivity than IgM and IgG, the Ab detection should be given high priority to be implemented in current clinical and public health 11 practice. If, unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 become a common respiratory transmission pathogen lasting in humans, like influenzas or other less-pathogenic coronaviruses, rather than be completely eradicated as SARS-CoV-1, the serological diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection will more depend on the detection of IgM in post-epidemic areas in the subsequent epidemic seasons. The Ab and IgG could be used to understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assist in determining the level of humoral immunity in patients. Even then, the Ab will be a more sensitive marker for sentinel monitoring of imported cases in naive community.",

The IgM \u03bc-chain capture method (IgM-ELISA) was used to detect the IgM antibodies, using the same HRP-conjugate RBD antigen as the Ab-ELISA.
