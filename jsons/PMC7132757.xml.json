This space is filled by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A hallmark of meningitis is the spillover of cells into the CSF to produce an increased cell count. Meningitis is the major infectious syndrome of the central nervous system (CNS). Meningitis can also be produced by several noninfectious causes. Sometimes involvement is more widespread than just the meninges. When meningitis is accompanied by obvious parenchymal involvement, it is more properly referred to as meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis, or meningoencephalomyelitis. When there is nerve-root involvement it is a meningoradiculitis.",

The CNS is a sequestered organ that is confined anatomically within a bony casement. There is little room for expansion during a localized inflammatory response without risking damage to intrinsic structures or even a herniation syndrome. Because the CNS lacks a fully developed and operational immune system to defend against invading pathogens, infection is harder to eradicate. It is also more difficult to deliver adequate concentrations of antimicrobials to the CNS. Because critical tissues are involved, meningitis produces unique sequelae with potentially devastating consequences. In some cases it is a true neurologic and medical emergency.",

There are two distinct types of meningitis. Aseptic meningitis implies that there is no obvious infectious cause after an initial evaluation for bacteria. Screening cultures and stains must be negative.54 In cases in which an origin is ultimately established, the usual cause is a virus. Although bacteria are ultimately identified in some aseptic meningitis patients, they are not the agents that cause fulminant septic disease. In contrast, septic meningitis is always caused by bacterial infection. The CSF profiles of aseptic and septic meningitis are different. It is important to distinguish aseptic from septic meningitis because they have different management strategies and prognoses.",

Hemophilus influenzae was responsible for almost half of all meningitis cases and for more than 70% of infections in children younger than age 5.44, 56 The epidemiology of septic meningitis changed drastically after widespread use of conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae. Meningitis caused by this agent has decreased by 94%.45 In 1986 there were a total of 12, 960 septic meningitis cases in the United States. By 1995 this number had dropped by 55% down to 5755 cases a year. The median age of the typical meningitis patient over this same period rose from 15 months in the prevaccine era to 25 years in the postvaccine era. In the United States, septic meningitis shows a racial predisposition. Infection with the major bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, group B streptococcus) are significantly increased in African Americans; risks relative to non-African Americans range from 2.1 to 2.6.45 There is also epidemiologic evidence that an increasing proportion of adult meningitis is caused by nosocomial rather than community-acquired infection. A recent review of 493 cases at a Massachusetts hospital noted that nosocomial infection accounted for 28% of all cases from 1980 through 1988.15 Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 39% of nosocomial infections, compared with only 3% of community-acquired infections. During the 1960s gram negatives accounted for only 11% of all meningitis cases. By the 1980s this had increased to 24%. Risk factors for nosocomial infection include recent neurosurgery, indwelling neurosurgical device, or altered immune status.",

In general, children and young adults are most likely to be infected with N. meningitidis, whereas older adults are infected with S. pneumoniae. There are often other useful clues to suggest specific pathogens. Staphylococcal infection is seen with indwelling catheters, shunts, endocarditis, and head trauma and after neurosurgery. Proteus species, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Flavobacterium may be pathogens when a patient is on an assisted ventilation device. L. monocytogenes infection occurs in association with diabetes, ethanol abuse, old age, and immunocompromise. Anaerobes may cause meningitis in the setting of ruptured brain abscess. Gram-negative bacterial infection occurs with head trauma and after neurosurgery, sepsis, immunocompromise, ruptured brain abscess, and systemic infection with the parasite strongyloides. S. pneumoniae infection, although the major pathogen overall, is particularly likely with pneumonia, sickle cell disease, cirrhosis, and myeloma.",

The CSF cell count is greater than 100 WBC/mm3 in 90% of patients; 65% to 70% of patients have cell counts greater than 1000 WBC/mm3. Occasionally (in as much as 10% of cases), there is an initial mononuclear pleocytosis, particularly with cell counts less than 1000. Combined CSF findings that have a predictive value of 99% for bacterial meningitis are glucose less than 34 mg/dL, CSF-to-serum-glucose ratio less than 0.23, and WBC cell count higher than 2000 WBC/mm3 or polymorphonuclear count higher than 1180 WBC/mm3.49 Neuroimaging is not diagnostically useful in most cases. However, in a recent review, neuroimaging was recommended prior to lumbar puncture in patients who had coma, papilledema, or focal neurologic findings.36 Neuroimaging is also obviously helpful to evaluate possible complications of meningitis. Other useful tests for the diagnosis of septic meningitis include blood cultures, which are positive for the organism in as much as half of cases. Partial treatment of bacterial meningitis (with oral antibiotics for example) decreases the positivity rates of CSF culture and Gram stain and may decrease CSF protein and neutrophil cell count.28 With appropriate intravenous antibiotics, culture and Gram stain should become negative after 24 hours, and CSF glucose approaches normal levels in 80% of patients within 3 days. Protein and cell count are less susceptible to rapid treatment. At 1 week the cell count is still increased, but at lower levels, in 50% of patients. The protein level remains elevated for 10 or more days.",

There is a first-generation vaccine for S. pneumoniae, but it is not very effective for meningitis.33 A second-generation vaccine is being tested. With regard to N. meningitidis, most meningitis cases are caused by Group C, although organisms from Groups A, B, D, X, Z, 29E, W135, and Y are occasional pathogens. N. meningitidis also has an inadequate first-generation vaccine, but conjugate vaccines are being tested.33 Chemoprophylaxis is used for close contacts of patients who have N. meningitidis or H. influenzae meningitis.",
