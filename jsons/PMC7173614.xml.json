            "text": "Before meningitis can occur, the causative agent must first penetrate the body from the external environment and then gain entry to the nervous system across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Initial entry of the virus into the host may occur by gastrointestinal inoculation (as is the case with the enteroviruses), cutaneous inoculation (as occurs with the arthropod-borne agents), the respiratory route (as is the case with mumps), or transmucosal penetration or intravenous inoculation (as occurs with HIV). Early workers in the field of viral central nervous system (CNS) infections believed that invasion of the nervous system occurred by spread of viruses within neurons. Currently, however, it is known that the majority of viral meningitides result from hematogenous dissemination of virus following symptomatic or clinically inapparent systemic infection. Penetration across the blood\u2013brain barrier may occur at the choroid plexus or through meningeal capillaries. Exceptions to this are unusual but include meningitis following genital herpes simplex infection, meningitis associated with herpes zoster, and Mollaret's meningitis, in which reactivated infection of herpes simplex virus type 2 within dorsal root ganglia leads to repeated episodes of meningitis. Replication of viruses in cells of the meninges, superficial brain or spinal cord parenchyma, and the ventricular system elicits an inflammatory response, which is predominantly lymphocytic, and results in alteration of the blood\u2013brain barrier so that protein levels increase within CSF. Unlike bacteria or fungi, however, replication of viruses does not consume glucose within CSF, nor does it usually result in altered transport of glucose across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Thus, in contrast to bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infections, CSF glucose concentrations in viral meningitis are usually normal.",

Although more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses have been identified, coxsackievirus A9 and echoviruses E7, E9, E11, E19, and E30 account for 70% of all cultured isolates of CSF. Polioviruses, although not associated with viral meningitis in developed countries, still cause aseptic meningitis in underdeveloped countries as well as paralytic disease. Enteroviruses are disseminated by fecal\u2013oral spread, and cases in developed countries tend to cluster during summer months when conditions of sanitation tend to be most relaxed. Recent studies employing polymerase chain reaction methods, however, confirm older observations that enteroviral CNS infections occur throughout the year, and many previously undiagnosed cases of viral meningitis occurring during winter months are also caused by these agents. Coxsackieviruses and echoviruses may cause encephalitis and, rarely, paralytic disease.",

Although these agents are most commonly considered to cause encephalitis, all of them, with the exception of Eastern equine encephalitis, more frequently cause an illness in which meningitis symptoms predominate. The most common arthropod-borne agents associated with viral meningitis include St. Louis encephalitis virus, the California/LaCrosse group of viruses, Colorado tick fever, and, as an emerging pathogen, West Nile virus. These agents, like enteroviruses, have a peak incidence in summer and early fall.

Of these, however, only herpes simplex virus has been associated with significant numbers of cases. Older data suggest that herpes simplex virus type 2 accounts for 2 or 3% of cases of viral meningitis. Recent work employing polymerase chain reaction methods suggests that it may be the most common cause of viral meningitis in adult women. Herpes simplex type 2 most often causes meningitis following primary genital infection. Occasional cases may also follow primary genital infection with herpes simplex virus type 1; nonprimary genital infection with either serotype only rarely causes disease. CSF pleocytosis occurs during both chicken pox and herpes zoster with or without skin lesions; this pleocytosis is usually asymptomatic but may occasionally be associated with meningitic symptoms.",

Like arthropod-borne agents, LCMV is not a human virus but is a virus of wild and laboratory mice. LCMV is associated with human cases of meningoencephalitis as a consequence of exposure to laboratory or wild mice and in rare epidemics it is associated with pet hamsters. Cases tend to be more common under conditions of impoverished living and poor hygiene. Only approximately 15% of infected individuals develop meningitis. LCMV meningitis typically occurs during autumn and early winter, and it has been suggested that this reflects more extensive mouse\u2013human contact as mice move inside to escape winter weather. In studies prior to 1960, the virus was thought to account for 9\u201311% of cases of viral meningitis. In recent years, reports of meningitis due to LCMV have been rare. However, congenital LCMV infection is a significant, often unrecognized cause of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mental retardation. Acquired LCMV infection likewise may be an underappreciated illness. The meningitis caused by LCMV may be extremely persistent and has been associated with symptoms and CSF abnormalities lasting months. Acquired LCMV infection may also be associated with encephalitis, transverse myelitis, a Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9-type syndrome, and both transient and permanent acquired hydrocephalus.",

Patients present with headache, photophobia, and, in many instances, symptomatic neck stiffness or back pain. Significant alteration of consciousness is far less common than in bacterial meningitis but does occasionally occur. Seizures or focal neurological signs are unusual and raise concerns about concomitant viral encephalitis or infection due to some other process, such as brain abscess. Patients are usually uncomfortable but do not appear severely ill. Physical examination may reveal evidence of systemic illness, including rash, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, or splenomegaly, depending on the infectious agent. Neurological examination will reveal nuchal rigidity. The patient may be unable to touch chin to chest. Resistance to passive neck flexion and Kernig's and/or Brudzinski's signs may be present but are inconsistent, and both signs may be absent in milder cases. A useful test of nuchal rigidity is to ask the patient to touch forehead to knee; this will often be positive when all other tests of meningeal irritation are questionable or absent. Papilledema is rare. Focal neurological signs are unusual and raise concerns about more serious infections, including viral encephalitis and brain abscess.

Exceptions exist to this CSF formula, however. Cell count may be as high as 1000 cells/mm3. During the first 24\u201348 hr of infection, CSF may contain a mixture of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. Recent studies suggest that the persistence of neutrophils in CSF during viral meningitis may be more prolonged than previous appreciated. Glucose concentrations, although usually >50% of blood values, may be significantly depressed: This has been reported with meningitis due to herpes zoster, mumps, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

These include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Lyme disease, infections due to Ehrlichiae or, rarely, other Rickettsial agents, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and fungi (particularly Cryptococcus neoformans and, rarely, Toxoplasma gondii). Tuberculous and fungal meningitis are often, but not always, accompanied by a significant decrease in CSF glucose. Lyme meningitis may produce CSF findings identical to those seen in viral meningitis. However, papilledema, erythema migrans, and cranial neuropathies are common features of Lyme meningitis, whereas they are distinctly unusual in viral meningitis. Similarly, patients with Lyme meningitis tend to have fewer white blood cells (mean, 80 vs 301/mm3) and a significantly greater percentage of mononuclear cells than patients with viral meningitis. Both M. tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are difficult to culture but are readily detectable by PCR; PCR tests for Ehrlichiae are in limited use but may not be available in all hospital laboratories. Aseptic meningitis may also occur as a complication of therapy with a number of agents, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, carbamazepine, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Patients with recurrent (Mollaret's) meningitis often have recurrent infection due to herpes simplex type 2. However, a very similar picture can be seen in patients in whom there is period leakage from dermoid or epidermoid cysts abutting the meninges. In such patients, the diagnosis may be made by careful MRI examination of brain and spinal cord. In cases of suspected viral meningitis, CSF should always be sent for bacterial culture, with inclusion of tests for other agents if clinically indicated.",
