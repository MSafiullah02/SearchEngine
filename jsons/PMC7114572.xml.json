The majority of human pathogens enter the body via mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment in the nose, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal vaccination at these sites can result in prevention of pathogen entry into the systemic circulation by local immune responses or in induction of systemic immunity and prevention of infection spread. In addition, there are many practical reasons that make mucosal vaccination strategies favourable in comparison to injected vaccines. Easier and less painful administration, reduced risk associated with injected vaccines and possible elimination of the cold chain are only some of the benefits associated with mucosal vaccines.",

Further branching from the bronchi are the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles and in the further branching of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli where the exchange of oxygen and CO2 with the blood occurs [2]. The proximal airways represent a pseudostratified columnar epithelium, composed of ciliated cells, basal cells and smaller number of goblet cells (Fig. 1\n). Goblet cells in the superficial epithelium and mucous cells in the submucosal glands secrete mucus into the respiratory lining. In the more distal airways the epithelium becomes less multilayered, glands are less frequent and cells become less columnar. The alveolar surface is composed mainly of type I and type II pneumocytes that function as gas-exchange pneumocytes and surfactant secreting cells, respectively [2], [3].",

In the proximal airways, large particles (> 5 \u03bcm in diameter) are trapped in the mucus and cleared by the mucociliary escalator and by coughing. Additional defence mechanisms are necessary to maintain lung sterility since most of the pathogens are smaller than 5 \u03bcm. The cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract were shown to produce a variety of molecules that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses [3], [4], [5], [6]. By secreting these mediators, the pulmonary epithelium is capable of recruiting and activating cells of the innate immune system, killing pathogens and initiating an adaptive immune response. The airways have a constant antimicrobial environment provided by both constitutively expressed chemical defences and inducible chemical defences which are enhanced in response to infection.",

            "text": "The secreted molecules in the lung can be categorized into antimicrobial substances, chemotactic mediators and inflammatory mediators. Antimicrobial products are secreted from secretory cells in the mucosa and possess direct antimicrobial activity or facilitate the elimination of infectious pathogens by phagocytes. Defensins [7], [8], [9], cathelicidins [10], [11], [12] and collectins [13], [14], [15] are the principal antimicrobial peptides families that are expressed in the respiratory tract. Another important molecule with antimicrobial function secreted from pulmonary epithelial cells is immunoglobulin A (IgA). It is synthesized in the lamina propria as a dimer that specifically binds to a secretory component on the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells and is internalized as a complex. The complex is then transported to the apical surface of the epithelial cells and released in the airways where it can neutralize viruses and block the entrance of bacterial agents into the body [16], [17]. Other secreted products associated with antimicrobial function in the lungs are lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), transferrin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Chemotactic agents are induced in response to a variety of stimuli and recruit inflammatory cells to the lung. Immune cells are recruited to the infected area by release of cytokines like IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as well as chemokines and expression of adhesion molecules by airway epithelial cells. Important inflammatory mediators that were shown to play an important role in pulmonary host defence include the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and GM-CSF. The inflammatory reaction will stay localized within the infected tissue as long as no pathological changes occur. Lung injury may result in cytokine leakage to the circulation and a systemic cytokine response [4], [5], [6].",

Nevertheless, human bronchial epithelial cells do not express the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 that are required for efficient APC function [20]. By contrast, in addition to MHC class II molecules, type II alveolar epithelial cells can also express co-stimulatory molecules and these are able to deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells [21].

            "text": "Macrophages are an essential element of human innate immunity to inhaled pathogens. Together with other components of the innate immune response, such as pulmonary surfactant, mucus secretion, mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial peptides, macrophages are able to control infection in the lungs, which are constantly exposed to the environment. Elimination of any potential infectious agents is achieved by phagocytosis and subsequent digestion [23], [24]. Macrophages have enhanced phagocytic capabilities through three groups of membrane receptors that facilitate opsonization: Fc receptors (Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, Fc\u03b3RIII for different IgG subclasses, FcR for IgE and IgA), complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4) and lectin receptors (mannose receptor) [25], [26]. Scavenger receptors (SRs) and CD14 on macrophage cell surfaces are associated with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [27], and pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are associated with macrophage stimulation after ligation by their microbial ligands [28]. Following phagocytosis, activated macrophages start to release microbicidal enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates and T cell stimulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The success of this non-specific pathogen elimination process is dependent on the pathogen type and load. A small number of microorganisms (\u223c 105) can be eliminated by alveolar macrophages alone while higher inocula (\u223c 108) will require activation of B and T cells for successful clearance. The macrophage's ability to eliminate a specific pathogen is also dependent on the microorganism's species. While Staphylococcus aureus is phagocytosed and killed intracellularly by alveolar macrophages, Mycobacteria spp., Listeria spp. and Legionella pneumophila are readily phagocytosed but no intracellular killing occurs, allowing these pathogens to reside and multiply in non-activated macrophages [25]. The decreased susceptibility to infection by these pathogens could be due to interference with TLR and IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation pathways in macrophages [29], [30]. More recently it was suggested that human-macrophage plasticity has a critical effect on pathogen survival and alternative activation modes of macrophages can lead to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and persistence of chronic infection [31].",

Macrophages are able to phagocytose, process and present antigens to stimulate T cells. Primary stimulation of T cell clones within the pulmonary lymphoid tissue is induced when alveolar macrophages migrate to bronchial lymph nodes and home to T cell paracortical areas [23], [32]. Pulmonary macrophages also have an effector function in acquired immunity since they are responsive to T cell derived cytokines and respond by increased microbicidal activity. Macrophages also have a regulatory function in acquired immunity. Since the lung is constantly exposed to harmful pathogens, unregulated acquired immune responses can result in a constant state of inflammation and damage to normal tissue and function. The macrophage populations in the lung are heterogeneous and some of the cells exhibit characteristics of suppressive cells [23], [33]. The relative proportions of inductive or suppressive macrophages developing from monocytes can be regulated by T cell cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 promote the inductive macrophages while IL-10 promotes the development of suppressive cells). Even after maturation, macrophages are able to switch phenotype and function in response to cytokine signals, which is an ideal characteristic for a cell population that is migrating constantly through the different environments within the lung.",

The phagocytic capacity of immature DCs is established by several mechanisms: phagocytosis of particles and microbes, macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. The last two mechanisms are extremely efficient in antigen sampling and require very small concentrations of the antigen in order to activate DCs. Upon stimulation, immature DCs capture the antigen, migrate to the draining lymphoid organs and differentiate into mature DCs. Maturation of DCs results in a decreased capacity to take up antigens and increased presentation capabilities. Mature DCs can be distinguished from immature DCs by the loss of receptors that are involved in antigen uptake and increased expression of MHC class II molecules, co-stimulatory molecules like CD40, CD58, CD80, CD86 and the maturation marker CD83 [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Following migration, DCs present their previous environment to T cells by displaying the processed antigen's peptides using MHC class-I and MHC class-II molecules, leading to cellular and humoral immune responses [38], [42].",

Additional populations exist in the submucosa below the airway epithelium, within alveolar septal walls and on the alveolar surface. It was previously shown that airway epithelial DC turnover time is 2\u20133 days. Under local stress (e.g. inflammatory state), the turnover of pulmonary DCs further accelerates, indicating their importance in local antigen surveillance [43], [44]. Local antigenic challenge will result in higher density of DCs in the airways and increased expression of activation markers [45], [46]. The level of mature DCs migrating to the peribronchial lymph nodes is increased during the first 24 h of inflammation. However, this response quickly wanes and the respiratory DCs are refractory to further migration in spite of continued inflammatory state. The induction of this refractory state also results in transient inhibition of DC migration in response to a second pulmonary stimulus [47].",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are the main DC receptors to be engaged in the direct recognition of characteristic molecular patterns of antigens. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns like bacterial nucleic acid, lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLRs triggers intracellular signalling that result in DC maturation. This includes upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC molecules and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ultimately leads to T cell activation. By contrast, CLRs recognize specific carbohydrate structures (pathogen cell-wall components) and internalize the pathogens for degradation in the lysosomal compartment to enhance processing and presentation by DCs. Nevertheless, one should remember that DCs act as \u201csentinels\u201d in the body and hence are sampling both self- and non-self-antigens. It is becoming evident that some of the CLRs, such as dectin-1, DC-SIGN and mannose receptor, may inhibit stimulatory signals. It has been proposed that TLRs and CLRs intersect and dictate the balance between immune-activation and tolerance [48], [49], [50]. It was also suggested that some pathogens such as HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis target DC-SIGN to seek immune escape. The \u201cmisuse\u201d of DC-SIGN results in pathogen survival by mechanisms that circumvent antigen processing or alter TLR-mediated signalling and skew T cell responses [51], [52], [53].",

            "text": "DC activation of T cells can result in immunity or tolerance, in activation of effector T cells or regulatory T cells and in different cytokine secretion profiles of T cells, polarizing Th1 and Th2 responses [35], [54]. In addition to the interactions with T cells in the lymphoid organs, DCs interact with other cells like B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The different and sometimes opposing roles performed by DCs are not likely to be carried out by the same cell and therefore different subtypes of DCs were identified. These subsets differ in their phenotype, localization and function. The two subsets effecting Th1/Th2 balance are plasmacytoid DCs (also known as the DC2 subset) localized in T cell zones of lymphoid tissues and are associated with Th2 responses. The other subset is myeloid DCs (DC1 subset) localized in the interstitium and in germinal centers of various tissues and is associated with Th1 responses [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]. The development of two functionally different sublineages could be explained by two models (Fig. 2\n): a single lineage that depends on local environmental signals (the functional plasticity model) or two different lineages that became committed at early developmental stage (the specialized lineage model). It seems that reality is a mixture of both models and there is functional plasticity influenced by environmental cytokines in both DCs and their precursors [35], [38], [60]. It is clear by now that several factors control the T helper balance of the immune response initiated by DCs: the DC lineage (DC1/DC2), the maturation signal and the inflammatory mediators present in the microenvironment [61], [62], [63], [64]. The \u201cdefault\u201d T helper response at mucosal surfaces is Th2, which might be due to an inherent property of the resident DC and macrophage populations. Induction of Th1 responses in the lungs will require exposure of DCs to appropriate stimulus and high level production of IL-12 [35], [65], [66], [67], [68].",

TLRs were discovered in the fruitfly Drosophila and are conserved throughout evolution [69], [70], [71], [72]. It was shown that drosophila, mouse, human and several more species possess a similar number of TLRs [73], [74]. Eleven human TLRs have now been identified that are able to recognize structurally unrelated ligands [75], [76], [77], [78]. TLR-activating ligands (summarized in Table 1\n) include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipoproteins, unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, double stranded RNA (dsRNA), and others [79], [80], [81]. Not all TLRs are expressed on the cell surface, a feature that is in accordance with the nature of the different TLRs ligands. TLR4 was found to be localized at the cell membrane, while TLR9 and TLR3 are localized intracellularly. LPS is present in the cell wall of the pathogen and is therefore recognized upon first contact with the host cell by TLR4 located on the cell surface. However, as bacterial DNA resides inside the bacteria, endo-lysosomal degradation of the pathogen's cell wall is required before it is available for recognition by TLR9 present in the endosomal compartment of APCs [82], [83], [84]. An exception to LPS response is intestinal epithelial cells where TLR4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus [85].",

Higher levels of TLR mRNA were shown to be expressed in tissues that are exposed to the external environment like the lung and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as at immunologically active sites such as peripheral blood leukocytes and the spleen [87]. Different cells can show distinct sets of TLR expression leading to differences in the reactivity to microbial molecules. This suggests that cells have undergone a distinct evolutionary development pathway, enabling them to recognize different pathogens. In DCs, the expression pattern has widely been explored and it was found that monocytes (DC1s) preferentially express TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 and plasmacytoid DCs (DC2s) express TLR7 and TLR9 [88], [89].",

            "text": "The role of TLRs in pulmonary infections and lung disease is being intensively investigated (reviewed in Ref. [90]). Recently, expression of all known TLRs was reported in an airway epithelial cell line and in primary bronchial epithelial cells, however, TLRs 2, 3, 5 and 6 were the most highly expressed [91]. The interaction between inhaled pathogens and innate immunity is mediated by TLRs expressed on pulmonary epithelial cells lining the airways and the network of APCs present in the lungs. The most explored interaction is that of pulmonary pathogens with TLRs 2 and 4. Human airway epithelial cells express TLR2 and their activation enhances the host defence by increasing expression of the antimicrobial peptide human \u03b2-defensin 2 [92], [93]. TLR4 was shown to be constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and despite its intracellular localization, lung epithelial cells responded to LPS [94]. Respiratory syncytial virus was shown to upregulate TLR4 mRNA and protein expression and increase TLR4 localization on the membrane of airway epithelial cells. This increased interaction between LPS and TLR4 expressed on lung epithelial cells can promote airway inflammation response during RSV infection [95]. In bacterial infection, TLR4 is associated with recognition of gram-negative bacterial LPS while TLR2 has the capacity to recognize major cell-wall constituents of gram-positive bacteria. Despite this generally accepted model, involvement of both receptors in the immune response against the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated and confirmed. A point of debate is to which extent TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in antibacterial host defence, and contradictory in vivo results were obtained, likely due to differences in the bacterial challenge models [96], [97], [98], [99]. Determining the roles of TLRs in host defence against M. tuberculosis has also focused mainly on TLR2 and 4 [100]. It was suggested that TLR2 has an important function in immunity to tuberculosis [101], [102], however, TLR4 did not have a significant role in immunity to tuberculosis in the mouse model [103], [104], [105]. Although evidence was collected to show involvement of TLRs in immunity to pulmonary pathogens, future work should define more clearly the extent to which the host defence against these pathogens is dependent on TLR signalling, including the bacterial pathogen and load involved.",

            "text": "The BALT is the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the respiratory tract. It is a secondary lymphoid tissue comprised of non-encapsulated accumulation of lymphoid tissue. Specialized epithelial cells with microfolds on their luminal side, also known as M cells, are the principal site for sampling of mucosal antigens and transferring antigens unchanged to the underlying dome area that contains many APCs and T cells (Fig. 3\n). Stimulation by an antigen will result in generation of secretory IgA antibodies, which are able to cross epithelial membranes and help in the prevention of future entry of pathogens through the mucosal site. Furthermore, lymphocytes that were stimulated by antigens in the mucosal inductive site migrate via the regional lymph nodes and the thoracic duct to the blood stream and from there to other mucosal effector sites. This migration leads to IgA production at other mucosal sites of the MALT (gut, nasal, and genitourinary-associated lymphoid tissues) and was termed the common mucosal immune system (CMIS) [106], [107], [108], [109]. The CMIS appears to have organ selectivity as enhanced memory is seen at the site of mucosal priming compared to that of distant mucosal sites [110]. Nevertheless, the role of IgA should not be overemphasized in the discussion of respiratory immunity since T cell responses are of prominent importance in initiating local immune responses in the lung and induction of cytotoxic T cell responses are necessary for elimination of viral and bacterial infections [111], [112], [113].",

It was found that the respiratory epithelium overlaying the bronchial lymphoid structures contains M cells that are flattened and devoid of cilia [114], [115], [116], [117]. The BALT shows high variability between species and although constitutive structures are seen in rabbits and rats, this is not the case in humans [118], [119]. Studies of human BALT showed that BALT is not a constitutive structure in lungs of healthy adults and BALT observed in younger adults (until the age of 20) consists of smaller follicles than those described, e.g. in rabbits [120], [121]. It was previously discussed that detection of BALT in the human adult lung is associated with infection or inflammation [121]. Moyron-Quiroz et al. [122] had shown that influenza infection resulted in the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in mice lacking lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches). The iBALT was capable of priming influenza-specific T and B cells that were able to clear the virus and facilitate host survival. Although iBALT resembles constitutive BALT, it is not induced by an antigen-independent developmental pathway, its size varies widely and it can be found in different pulmonary compartments than the constitutive BALT [122]. These findings point out that although constitutive BALT is not found in human adults, this tissue can be induced by local infection. However, observations in animal models may not directly be extrapolated to the human situation.",

This was demonstrated by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding influenza A nucleoprotein [135], HIV Gag and Env antigens [136], [137], [138], hepatitis B virus surface and core antigens [139], [140], M. tuberculosis antigen 85A and heat shock protein 65 [141], [142], among others. Activation of CTLs after DNA immunization can occur in two ways: (I) by APCs that were directly transfected by the DNA; (II) by cross-priming, in which non-APCs initially produce the protein encoded by the DNA vaccine and then deliver the antigen to a professional APC for priming of MHC class I restricted CTL responses. Although non-APCs (e.g. myocytes) take up and produce protein more than other cell types after DNA administration, they usually lack the co-stimulatory signals needed for the CTL activation process [143], [144], [145]. In the case of type II alveolar cells, it was shown they are able to express co-stimulatory molecules and deliver co-stimulatory signals to T cells therefore present an additional mechanism for activating CTL responses in the lung (Fig. 5\n) [21].",

Bacterial plasmid DNA contains unmethylated CpG motifs that are not prevalent in vertebrate genomic DNA and are able to stimulate APCs via TLR9. These CpG motifs can trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, and therefore, the generation of Th1 responses may be a general property of DNA vaccines. Nevertheless, the route of vaccination and the vaccine carrier has a pronounced effect on the nature of the immune response elicited (reviewed in [146]). As an example, the application of DNA vaccines by \u2018gene gun\u2019 resulted in a Th2 biased response. The gene gun application system uses vaccine coated gold particles that are introduced intradermally by ballistic action. It was shown that the Th2 response was a result of the mode of application and not a result of the different site of vaccination (skin vs. muscle). A possible explanation is that the gene gun delivers the DNA directly into the cells, bypassing the surface interaction of APCs with the CpG motifs. The ability of DNA vaccines to preferentially induce Th1 responses may be particularly important for preventing intracellular infections that require Th1 immunity to optimize the pathogen's eradication [124], [125].",

The antibody response is increased in a dose\u2013response manner, however, once the optimal dose is given, a plateau in the antibody response is reached, and no significant effect is achieved after increasing the dose further or giving multiple injections. Since DNA vaccination generally enhances Th1 cytokine production, the subclass of antibodies generated will be biased toward IgG2a production. Also, as was seen for the T helper responses, the route of DNA vaccination can bias toward IgG1 production (gene gun). In some cases, antibodies have contributed to protection against challenge with the relevant pathogen, indicating that the antigens could generate neutralizing antibodies [124], [125].",

Only 5\u201310% of the infected people develop an active disease during their lifetime since in normal healthy persons, the immune system is able to control the disease. However, the bacilli can stay dormant in the body and in an immunosuppressed state, the chances of developing an active disease increase. The disease is spread by individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis by air. If left untreated, a sick person infects on average 10\u201315 people every year by creating aerosol droplets containing the bacilli (by coughing, sneezing etc.). Overall, 2 million people die every year from tuberculosis. A relieve of this situation seems far-off, especially with the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the deadly combination of AIDS and tuberculosis [147], [148]. The \u201cStop TB initiative\u201d is a world-embracing program that is committed to diagnosis, treatment and future prevention of tuberculosis. Using the Directly Observed Therapy Short-course program (DOTS; an internationally recommended TB control strategy), tuberculosis is better controlled in different areas in the world, however, it is clear that without immunization it will be difficult to stop the transmission of the disease [149], [150]. A preventative vaccine will best control a disease like this, however, the only vaccine available for tuberculosis is the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that was shown to have a protective effect against meningeal tuberculosis in children. However, the BCG fails to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis in adults [151]. Many efforts are directed at finding new candidate vaccines which will provide broad protection against disease and infection, induce lifelong immunological memory, would be safe, stable and inexpensive [149], [152].",

Since DNA vaccines can induce strong cellular immunity, many preclinical studies were performed using different encoding antigens [153]. The first reports of DNA vaccines against tuberculosis showing immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice were performed using the antigen 85A (Ag85A) and 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) from M. tuberculosis\n[141], [142]. Many other antigens such as ESAT-6 [154], [155], [156], Mtb 8.4 [157], 19 kDa lipoptotein [158], [159], MPT64 [155], [156], Ag85B [155], [160], putative phosphate transport receptors (PstS) [161], [162] and more [153] were also studied and provided different degrees of immunogenicity and protection. Most of these vaccines encode mycobacterial proteins that are secreted in mycobacterial culture filtrate or are exposed on the mycobacterial cell-wall surface. The availability of the complete M. tuberculosis genome [163] makes tuberculosis DNA vaccines popular for research since open reading frames (ORF) presenting potential antigens can be immediately used without the need to express and purify the protein. The general belief is that a successful tuberculosis DNA or protein vaccine will require a \u201ccocktail\u201d of immunogens [164].",

Although antibodies to most RSV proteins will be generated in RSV infection, protection is incomplete and re-infection is possible even in the presence of high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, local antibodies in the respiratory tract were found to be related to protection: neutralizing antibodies were found to correlate with relative protection and local production of IgA concurs with virus clearance. Maternal antibodies appear to protect newborns against infection, however, their concentration decreases during the first 6 months of life where the disease peaks in infants. RSV infection is associated with a balanced type 1 and type 2 T helper response that is important for coordination of protective and immunopathogenic responses [166], [167]. The promise that DNA vaccines hold for preventing RSV is that the encoded antigen might be expressed for prolonged periods of time, immunizing the infant at the appropriate time point when the maternal antibodies concentration decreases under protection levels [168]. Most of the vaccination studies so far were performed in rodents and focused on two glycoproteins that are localized on the surface of the virus. The F protein is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and is highly conserved between RSV subtypes while the G protein mediates attachment to the host cell surface and is responsible for the antigenic diversity between the RSV subtypes. DNA vaccines encoding RSV-G protein induced balanced systemic and pulmonary Th1/Th2 responses, neutralizing antibodies and protection against RSV infection of the lower respiratory tract of both mice and rats [169], [170]. RSV-F protein encoding vector showed to induce high neutralizing antibodies titers, CTL responses, protection against intranasal challenge of live RSV and high IFN-\u03b3 expression in the lungs after challenge [171]. Furthermore, it was shown that addition of CD40 ligand to DNA vaccines encoding RSV-F and G antigens can enhance viral clearance and some parameters of the immune response to RSV challenge [172].",

Viral isolation and serological assays confirmed that SARS-CoV was the primary infectious agent, its genome was sequenced and it was defined as a new coronavirus that is not a member of any of the three coronavirus groups known so far [175], [176]. The route of transmission has not been completely established yet, but it was immediately observed that health-care workers in close contact with SARS patients are at high risk, probably as a result of aerosol-generating procedures [177], [178], [179]. Airborne transmission seems possible and supported by a case of community SARS outbreak in a Hong Kong housing complex and the observation that a face mask is the most efficient precaution for medical staff protection [180]. There is a need for better understanding of the exact transmission mechanism by droplets and a definition whether SARS is obligatory, preferentially or opportunistically airborne transmitted [181].",

The most promising vaccine candidates are the two structural proteins: the nucleocapside protein (N) and the spike protein (S). It was shown that 89% of a group of patients with SARS produced antibodies to the N protein while less than 63% produced antibodies to the S protein [182]. In another study using neutralization assay with pseudotype virus, it was shown that SARS-CoV elicited a strong humoral neutralizing response to the S protein [183]. Many efforts are directed at finding specific domains and epitopes of the S protein that will induce strong production of anti SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and will advance the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS [184], [185], [186], [187]. DNA vaccine encoding the S protein of the SARS-CoV induces neutralizing antibodies, T cell response and protective immunity in mice. The protection mechanism was not dependent on T cell immunity since T cell depletion did not affect vaccine-induced protection and furthermore, adoptive T cell transfer did not reduce pulmonary viral replication in the recipient animals. In contrast, passive transfer of purified IgG from immunized mice provided protection similar to that observed after DNA vaccination [188]. DNA immunization using N protein encoding plasmid resulted in specific anti-N antibodies and specific CTL response [189], [190]. Since in some models it was shown that only the S protein was protective [191], future experiments should detect the best vaccine candidate or prove that a combination of these structural antigens will induce the best viral protection.",

Although it can induce both local and systemic immune responses, the main mucosal effect remains in the upper airways, which may lead to insufficient respiratory immunity against pulmonary pathogens. Using a murine model of respiratory reovirus infection it was shown that stimulation of NALT alone did not induce an optimal antibody response and effective immunity was only achieved by a combination of upper and lower respiratory tract infection [194]. A combined approach using intranasal and intratracheal administration simultaneously was recently used in African green monkeys where an attenuated parainfluenza virus expressing the SARS coronavirus spike protein was administered once and induced detectable neutralising antibodies against SARS coronavirus in serum [195]. Furthermore, a comparison between upper respiratory tract immunization (intranasal) and lower respiratory tract immunization (intratracheal) using inactivated influenza virus and a prototype split-subunit vaccine showed that intratracheal immunization was more effective in inducing local and systemic immune responses [196]. Another comparison between intratracheal, intranasal and intramuscular delivery of microencapsulated mixed Yersinia pestis subunit vaccines (V and F1 subunits) showed that intratracheal immunization resulted in higher immune responses in the respiratory tract, dominated by local IgG to both antigens [197].",

Efficient immune responses were demonstrated for tuberculosis [198], [199], [200], [201], measles [202] and influenza [203] emphasizing the great potential of deep lung immunization for prevention of pulmonary infections. The measles vaccine is the most explored for pulmonary administration. The WHO has been focusing on the development of aerosol measles vaccine for several years and is supporting efforts to change the administration route of the vaccine [204]. The main reasons for this are the ability for mass vaccination campaigns, the possible administration by non-medical personnel and most importantly, the ability to eliminate transmission of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and other blood-borne pathogens by poor practice of injection safety procedures. Dry powder formulations of measles vaccine for pulmonary aerosol delivery appear to be a viable approach, retaining the vaccine's potency and eliminating the cold chain requirement during immunization [205], [206]. Future studies with other vaccines aiming to eradicate respiratory diseases are needed to compare current application methods for vaccines with the pulmonary route.",

The first disadvantage is the possibility of hypersensitivity responses to the vaccine preparation. Therefore, immunization studies should check specific immune responses to the vaccine and determine local hypersensitivity responses or lung pathologies that resulted from the vaccine and/or its formulation. Another immunological concern in pulmonary immunization is the development of mucosal tolerance as a response to antigen deposition in the lung. It was established that soluble antigens delivered to the respiratory mucosa without inflammatory signals or sensitised T cells, induced tolerance after systemic challenge [207]. Finally, a practical disadvantage is the small volume of liquid-formulations that can be applied in small animal models, especially in mice that are the best immunologically characterized animal serving as model for many investigated diseases. This argument, however, may be mute in the case of vaccines given as dry powder formulations.",

In addition to the practical issues mentioned above for mucosal vaccine delivery in general, this approach will enable vaccination of immunocompromised individuals since there is no threat of virulence as encountered by live attenuated vaccines [208]. Inhalation of DNA vaccines was recently described using plasmids encoding ovalbumin, hepatitis B surface antigen [209] and HLA-A*0201-restricted T cell epitopes of M. tuberculosis\n[210] and were shown to increase immunity as measured by antibodies and cytokine production. It was suggested that the immune response is highly dependent on the encoded antigen and it should be further investigated whether this application method holds an advantage in comparison to the common vaccination procedure by intramuscular injection. Furthermore, the mechanism of immune induction should be explored with an emphasis on the interaction of the antigens with pulmonary DCs, DCs migration to other lymphoid organs and the migration of immune cells to the lung after pulmonary immunization. The role of the BALT as a part of the CMIS should also be defined in the context of pulmonary DNA vaccination in order to clarify whether the lung can influence immunity in other mucosal effectors sites. Since IgA is not always present in broncho-alveolar lavage [209], its role in pulmonary immunity and disease protection should be elucidated.",

Chitosan polymers can vary in their molecular weight, viscosity and degree of deacetylation. The solubility of chitosan is highly dependent on the degree of deacetylation and the pH. In pH values lower than 6.5 chitosan is positively charged and is able to form complexes with anions (Fig. 7a). It is biodegradable, biocompatible and presents an excellent toxicity profile. Furthermore, chitosan was shown to be mucoadhesive and enhance mucosal absorption by opening tight junctions, therefore it is favourable for vaccine delivery into mucosal tissues. Oral delivery of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding peanut allergy antigen generated protective immunity [233]. Additionally, these nanoparticles enhanced immune responses when given intranasally with a cocktail of plasmid DNAs encoding RSV antigens [234] and a lyophilized formulation of DNA encoding a CTL epitope from M2 protein of RSV complexed to chitosan induced significant reduction of viral load in lungs of intranasally immunized mice [235]. Oral delivery of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding GRA1 protein of Toxoplasma gondii presented enhanced immunogenicity [236].

They are biocompatible, biodegradable and present low toxicity [240]. PLGA microparticles and nanoparticles were described to efficiently encapsulate plasmid DNA [241], [242]. Encapsulated DNA plasmid in PLGA microparticles was shown to elicit protective immune responses against tumors [243] and stimulate durable T cell responses to tumor-associated antigen cytochrome P450 1B1 [244]. Release of DNA was improved by addition of poly-\u03b2 amino ester to the PLGA microparticles and enhanced antigen-specific rejection of tumor cells in vivo compared to conventional PLGA microparticles [245]. Cationic PLGA microparticles were designed to enable adsorption of DNA to the surface instead of encapsulation [246]. PLGA microparticles bearing the cationic agent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag protein after intramuscular and intranasal administration in mice [230], [247]. Potent responses were also achieved for DNA encoding E1E2 envelope proteins of hepatitis C virus [248]. These delivery systems are currently evaluated in clinical trials with genetic vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents (DNA encoding HPV antigenic epitopes encapsulated in PLGA microparticles, Zycos/MGI Pharma, http://www.zycos.com; DNA encoding HIV clade B Gag and Env antigens adsorbed to PLGA microparticles, NIAID, http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical_trials).",

Pulmonary DNA vaccination holds a promise for inducing local and systemic immune responses and should promote protection against inhaled airborne pathogens. In this review we presented the potential of the lung as a vaccination site that is specialized in antigen sampling and initiation of immunity using its epithelial cells, immune cells and local lymphoid tissue. Further evaluation of DNA vaccines against airborne pathogens is needed to determine their protective efficacy. In addition, new non-toxic pulmonary adjuvants and delivery systems should be characterized and investigated in vivo. In order to perform challenge studies where airborne pathogens are given as an aerosol, collaborative work with the appropriate biohazard facilities authorized to execute such experiments will be beneficial and enable the researchers to study the full potential of pulmonary applied vaccines.",

The other CTL activation mechanisms involve direct transduction of professional APCs after DNA immunization (b) and cross-priming, where the respiratory epithelium is transfected, produces the antigen and then transfer it to professional APCs, which are directly responsible for activation of CTL responses (c).",
