The early synthesis of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines) influences substantially the subsequent immune response and may, therefore, affect the course of infection. One of the important effectors of natural immunity are \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, which display a broad antiviral activity against different viruses such as retroviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, picornaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses, and orthopoxviruses (reviewed in [1]). This broad antiviral activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is likely to play a crucial defensive role, especially considering that their relatively large numbers (e.g., approximately one out of every 30 adult human peripheral blood lymphocytes is a V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocyte) can respond very quickly (typically, no antigen processing is required for the potent major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted activities of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells) and release soluble antiviral factors.",

This leads to an accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential metabolite that is directly recognized by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells [14]. Interestingly, the mevalonate pathway is critical for protein prenylation, which may be important for viral assembly (Fig. 1\n). In hepatoma cells exposed to lovastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate), hepatitic C virus (HCV) RNA replication is impaired due to the dissolution of the HCV replication complex [15]. The lovastatin treatment can also block respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication and cell-to-cell fusion in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting the isoprenylation of the cellular protein RhoA [16].",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP, a classical non-peptidic antigen for V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells) release an array of cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, GM-CSF, TPO, OSM) and chemokines (e.g., MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2, RANTES, SDF-1, MCP-2 MDC, ENA-78 and GRO) with known antiviral and/or immunomodulatory properties. After stimulation and in sharp contrast to many non-\u03b3\u03b4 TCR-expressing lymphoid cells, single V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocytes produce more than one of these soluble antiviral/immunoregulatory factors (Fig. 3\n). The innate response is followed by humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses influenced by many of these soluble molecules. In addition, the non-cytolytic antiviral molecules continue to suppress the infectious process in vital organs without destroying important cells and also can boost the antiviral potency of classical \u03b1\u03b2 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [21].",

In vitro, the non-cytolytic antiviral activity of interferons has been demonstrated in infections with HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpesviruses, orthopoxviruses, picornaviruses, retroviruses, influenza and other type of viruses (reviewed in [21], [24]). In hepatitis B-transgenic mice, IFN-\u03b3 released by CD8 T cells is able to diminish the HBV gene expression and replication and activates hepatocytes to clear the virus through a non-cytolytic pathway [25]. In the acute phase of HCV infection, the ability of T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 is associated with virus clearance [26]. Recently, it has been shown that NS3 peptide-stimulated CD8 T cells release IFN-\u03b3 and reduce HCV RNA replication activity [27]. Generally, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), the appearance of CD8-positive CTLs is better correlated with protection against HCV than the antibody response [28]. This is compatible with the idea that the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8-positive T-lymphocytes may contribute to the resolution of the infection [28]. Despite the potent interferon effects, the majority of patients become persistently infected with HCV. This chronic infection is associated with a drastic impairment of IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells [29] and a hepatic expansion of HCV-specific CD8-positive T lymphocytes with a regulatory phenotype [30]. Thus, the induction of IFN-\u03b3 production by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocytes could represent a new strategy to inhibit viral replication and to support the Th1-type immune response.",

IL-6 production by skin fibroblasts that support the replication of dengue virus and other flaviviruses in vivo may be an important factor in controlling flavivirus infections [34].

Chemokines act primarily as chemoattractants and activators of specific types of leukocytes. Some chemokines (such as the \u03b2-chemokines MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES) influence directly the rate of HIV replication [38]. The stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) that blocks the entry of CXCR4-dependent (T cell-tropic) HIV-1 isolates [39] has been identified as a ligand for LESTR/fusin [40]. RANTES and MCP-3 inhibit T cell-tropic HIV-1 isolates [41] and the macrophage chemotactic protein (MDC, macrophage-derived chemokine) can also block HIV-1 entry [42]. Other CD8 antiviral factors (e.g., CAF) inhibit HIV-1 transcription [43]. The post-integration mode of action makes CAF distinct from \u03b2-chemokines and similar to IL-16 [44]. Importantly, antigen-stimulated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells produce the HIV-inhibitory \u03b2-chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES) [45], [46] that block both CCR5 co-receptor-dependent (e.g., HIV-1BAL) and CXCR4 co-receptor-dependent (e.g., HIV-1LAI) viral isolates [45].

In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 (an important enhancer of TNF-\u03b1 production by macrophages) inhibits the HIV-1 growth in primary macrophages [56]. While TNF-\u03b1 has a protective role in activated CD4+ T cells against R5-tropic viruses, it enhances CXCR4 expression of CD4+ T cells and mediates an increased susceptibility to infection with X4-tropic HIV and SIV strains.

Some of these molecules are able not only to activate V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, but also can inhibit protein prenylation or cholesterol biosynthesis that may be required for viral assembly. Thus, N-BPs/Phosphostim-based therapeutic strategies should be considered to enhance the current inadequate armaments for fighting emerging and re-emerging viruses.",

Therefore, the MVA pathway may be important for viral assembly of particles requiring: (a) the prenylation of viral (HDV) or cellular (HCV, RSV) proteins; or (b) the synthesis of cholesterol (HIV, HBV) that is necessary for membrane budding. Blocking this pathway by statins or N-BPs interferes with both prenylation and cholesterol synthesis. However, the \u2018pre-IPP\u2019 statin inhibition decreases, whereas the \u2018post-IPP\u2019 N-BP block increases the accumulation of IPP, a potent endogenous stimulator of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocytes.",

Human PBMCs were incubated (24 h) in culture medium with of 128 \u03bcM sodium pamidronate and the IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 intracellular presence was assessed by flow cytometry. During the last 4 h of incubation, brefeldin A (10 \u03bcg/ml) was present to block the cytokine release from cells. Polyclonal stimulation with concanavalin A (not shown) generated a very similar pattern\u2014that is large numbers of V\u03b42+ CD3+ double producers (in contrast to predominant single producers in the \u03b1\u03b2 + CD3+ and V\u03b42- CD3-pools) with the exception of substantially larger amounts of single-TNF-\u03b1-positive \u03b1\u03b2 T cells. The cytokine production by the \u03b1\u03b2+ CD3+ or V\u03b42- CD3-cells in pamidronate-stimulated cultures was inhibited by anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAbs suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 released by pamidronate-stimulated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells may be an important factor in the induction of cytokine synthesis by the tested non-V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell pools.",
