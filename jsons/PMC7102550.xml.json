Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 10%1\n,\n2. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) broke out in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35%3\n,\n4. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, and their hosts are bat/civet and dromedary, respectively5\n,\n6. To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Therefore, CoVs are considered to be a kind of viruses, of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans. Because Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019, the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 20207\n,\n8. Since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous with SARS-CoV, it is considered a close relative of SARS-CoV. The International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. At the same time, WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as COVID-19. Common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-29.",

In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response11. Blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect. In addition, viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells, for example, the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor12, 13, 14 and the MERS binds to the DPP4 receptor15\n,\n16. The therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral RNA through acting on the genetic material of the virus, inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus, and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the virus\u2019s self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins.",

Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated. The second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus19\n,\n20. High-throughput screening makes this strategy possible, and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy, for example, the discovery of anti-HIV infection drug lopinavir/ritonavir. The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch. Theoretically, the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects, but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years, or even more than 10 years11.",

Once the efficacy is determined, it can be approved by the Green Channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug database (ZINC drug database, ZDD), our own database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine), and the database of commonly used anti-viral drugs (78 compounds) by virtual ligand screening method. This study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel coronaviruses and provides scientists with information on compounds that may be effective. Subsequent validation of anti-viral effects in vitro and in vivo will provide useful information for clinical treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.",

After phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species. We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1\nA). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1B, Bat-Cov RaTG13 exhibited the closest linkage with SARS-CoV-2. These phylogenetic evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be evolved from bat CoVs, especially RaTG13. Among all coronaviruses from human, SARS-CoV (80%) exhibited the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. And MERS/isolate NL13845 also has 50% identity with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV is the most clearly studied one among all these viruses according to previous literatures. Structure and function of its most genome encoded proteins have been elucidated in recent years. In this study, because of high genome identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the structure and function prediction of SARS-CoV-2 genome encoded protein were mainly based on those researches on homology protein in SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 genome has 10 open reading frames (Fig. 2\nA). ORF1ab encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab. After cleaved by two proteases, replicase proteins showed multifunction involved in transcription and replication of viral RNAs. ORF2-10 encodes viral structural proteins such as S, M, N, and E proteins, and other auxiliary proteins. The S, M, E proteins are involved in the formation of the viral coat, and the N protein is involved in the packaging of the RNA genome (Fig. 2C). By aligning with the amino acid sequence of SARS PP1ab and analyzing the characteristics of restriction cleavage sites recognized by 3CLpro and PLpro, we speculated 14 specific proteolytic sites of 3CLpro and PLpro in SARS-CoV-2 PP1ab (Fig. 2B). PLpro cleaves three sites at 181\u2013182, 818\u2013819, and 2763\u20132764 at the N-terminus and 3CLpro cuts at the other 11 sites at the C-terminus, and forming 15 non-structural proteins. Among them, Nsp3 contains multiple domains, including a segment of SARS unique domain and a deubiquitination and proteolytic enzyme PLpro. Nsp5 is 3CLpro, Nsp12 is an RdRp, and Nsp13 is helicase. As a new coronavirus, structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage. Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).",

After the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in TMHMM Server, as expected, we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for Nsp2 (Supporting Information Figs.

Recent researches speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2, and this was verified by computational docking and ELISA measurement24\n,\n25. Moreover, homology of the Spike-RBD sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 is as high as 95%.

Just like what described in recently published research53, most of selected compounds are also unable to bind with the contact surface of ACE2\u2013Spike complex. Actually, these potential ACE2 inhibitors may not be suitable to use as drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection because the poor prognosis would be induced by the inhibition of ACE2 enzyme activities, for ACE2 was considered as a protective factor of lung injury54.",

The three targets Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs. This may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein (Nsp3b and Nsp3c) or partial model (E-channel).
