            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive single\u2010stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, responsible of the most prevalent arthropode\u2010borne viral infection in humans. There are four antigenically related serotypes (DENV\u20101 to DENV\u20104), which cocirculate in tropical and subtropical regions around the world between their vectors, the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, and the vertebrate hosts. DENV human infection can be manifested either by the benign self\u2010limited febrile illness called dengue fever (DF) or by the severe and potentially fatal disease named dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler, 2002). Primary infection induces protective immunity only against the infecting serotype, and secondary infection with other serotype appears to be one of the risk factors to develop DHF/DSS through an immunopathological process of antibody\u2010dependent enhancement (ADE) (Kliks et al., 1989; Rothman, 2004). The failure to maintain programmes for controlling the mosquito vector has caused the global re\u2010emergence of this infection, turning DENV into a public health problem. Currently, it is estimated that the virus is endemic in more than 100 countries, producing about 50 million infections each year (Gubler, 2002).",

            "text": "Despite the increasing incidence of DENV as a human pathogen, there are no antiviral agents or vaccines for treatment or prevention, and little is known about the DENV multiplication cycle. In particular, the initial steps leading to DENV entry into the host cells for primary infection are presently very poorly understood. The events involved in virus entry comprise virion binding to the cell surface receptors followed by internalization into the cytoplasm. The envelope E glycoprotein has been identified as the DENV protein involved in both attachment and internalization, representing a key determinant for infection. By contrast, the identity of the cellular receptor interacting with E glycoprotein is, at present, controversial. Several recent reports have implicated a long list of receptor candidate molecules, including a wide diversity of proteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (reviewed in Acosta et al., 2008a). A probable reason for this complexity may be the ability of DENV to replicate in a wide spectrum of cells (Diamond et al., 2000), suggesting the possibility of divergent receptors according to the type of host cell. A plausible mechanism emerging from these conflicting data is a multistep process consisting of the sequential interaction of E with at least two target molecules: an abundant attachment receptor to concentrate virus particles on the cell surface and facilitate the subsequent interaction with a high affinity second receptor of protein nature which mediates virus internalization. According to the cell type, heparan sulfate and the lectin DC\u2010SIGN have been proposed as putative primary receptors (Mart\u00ednez\u2010Barrag\u00e1n and del Angel, 2001; Lozach et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Upon receptor binding, enveloped viruses exploit two main pathways for internalization of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm: membrane fusion at the cell surface (pH\u2010independent) or within intracellular vesicles after endocytosis (pH\u2010dependent). Earlier studies showed by electron microscopy observation that DENV\u20102 penetrated directly into the cytoplasm of human monocytes, mosquito and BHK cells by fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane at physiological pH (Hase et al., 1989; Lim and Ng, 1999) whereas the formation of low pH\u2010induced syncytia in DENV\u20102 infected cells was also published (Randolph and Stollar, 1990). More recent reports have provided evidence that uptake of DENV\u20102 virions in HeLa, mosquito C6/36, BHK\u201015, and BSC\u20101 cells occurs through receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, dependent on intravesicular low pH for membrane fusion activity (Krishnan et al., 2007; van der Schaar et al., 2007; Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008), similarly as it was observed for other members of Flavivirus (Mizutani et al., 2003; Nawa et al., 2003; Chu and Ng, 2004; Chu et al., 2006).",

For productive infection of HeLa, mosquito and BS\u2010C\u20101 cells, the functional entry of DENV\u20102 is clathrin\u2010dependent (Krishnan et al., 2007; Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008; van der Schaar et al., 2008), the most common and well\u2010known mode of endocytosis. But contrasting results have been reported about the role of membrane cholesterol for DENV\u20102 entry in diverse cellular systems such as human monocytes (Reyes\u2010del Valle et al., 2005), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Lee et al., 2008) and mosquito cells (Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008; Umashankar et al., 2008). Additionally, there are no reports addressing the functional entry mechanism utilized by serotypes other than DENV\u20102. The clinical characteristics associated with the distinct serotypes cannot be precisely defined, but diverse epidemiological studies have reported that DENV\u20102 caused more severe disease than DENV\u20101 (Vaughn et al., 2000; Nisalak et al., 2003; Balmaseda et al., 2006). Thus, the knowledge of the virus\u2013cell interactions leading to successful infection for different DENV serotypes may help to understand their varying in vivo pathogenic profile.",

To this end, cells were infected and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus attachment. Then, cells were washed with PBS at 4\u00b0C and shifted at 37\u00b0C to permit internalization of the bound particles. At various times after the shift, a series of infected cultures were treated with proteinase K to remove adsorbed virus whereas internalized virus remained protected inside the cell; after inactivation of the enzyme, suspensions of infected cells were plated on Vero cell monolayers to quantify infectious internalized particles by plaque formation. Another series of cultures were treated with PBS after each time of temperature shift and a similar infectious centre assay was performed to quantify total cell\u2010associated virus (membrane\u2010bound and internalized virions). The percentage of PFU resistant to proteinase K treatment in comparison with control PBS treatment was calculated for each time point. As shown in Fig. 1A, at the beginning of the temperature shift, most DENV\u20102 particles were detached from cells by proteinase K, but when the time of incubation at 37\u00b0C increased virus became rapidly resistant. After 60\u201390 min of incubation, 88\u201394% of virus was resistant to proteinase K treatment in comparison to control treatment, indicating a successful internalization of infectious virions. A similar profile in time and amount of internalized virus into Vero cells determined by the infectious centre assay was obtained for DENV\u20101 (data not shown).",

Consequently, the kinetics and rate of virus internalization were tested in cells non\u2010pre\u2010incubated during 1 h at 4\u00b0C, a condition previously chosen to separate adsorption and internalization processes. Vero cells were infected with DENV, immediately incubated at 37\u00b0C, and at different times the amount of internalized virus particles was determined by proteinase K treatment and infectious centre assay as described above. The curve of virus internalization in these assay conditions was comparable to that obtained with 1 h of preincubation at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 1B). A slight difference in the number of infectious internalized virus was initially detected, probably due to the lack of synchronization for penetration of pre\u2010adsorbed virions. But, after 30 min at 37\u00b0C, the amount of proteinase K\u2010resistant virus penetrated into the cell was similar for both assays. Thus, the effect of inhibitors on virus internalization was measured by protease treatment and infectious centre assay after 1 h of DENV infection at 37\u00b0C.",

Treatment of Vero cells with ammonium chloride and concanamycin A before infection and during the first hour of infection at 37\u00b0C significantly reduced the amount of internalized virus for both serotypes, with maximum effect at a concentration of 50 mM and 50 nM respectively (Fig. 2A). This low pH requirement was also assessed by inhibition of viral yield (Fig. S1A) and viral antigen expression detected by immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 2B). However, no inhibitory effect on virus multiplication was detected when ammonium chloride was added 1 h after infection, confirming that this compound effectively blocked an early event during the virus entry process (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, no virucidal effect of ammonium chloride was detected when the virus was pre\u2010incubated with the compound before infection (Fig. S1B) neither virus adsorption was affected (Fig. S1C). Similarly, lack of effect on virion inactivation and adsorption was detected with concanamycin A (data not shown). To ensure that the drug concentrations used effectively increased the pH of intracellular vesicles in Vero cells we performed acridine orange staining. Untreated cells showed the typical cytoplasmatic orange fluorescence of the acid compartments, whereas cells treated with ammonium chloride and concanamycin A did not exhibit this fluorescence pattern (Fig. S1D). Thus, it can be concluded that DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 require the acidic intracellular pH to penetrate into Vero cells indicating that virus entry occurs through a low pH\u2010dependent endocytic route.",

            "text": "Clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis is the most classical low pH\u2010dependent pathway used by different viruses to enter into the cells (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002a; Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Additionally, the involvement of clathrin for DENV\u20102 entry to mosquito C6/36 cells (Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008), human HeLa cells (Krishnan et al., 2007) and BS\u2010C\u20101 cells (van der Schaar et al., 2008) has been recently reported. To address the involvement of a clathrin\u2010mediated pathway in DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 entry to Vero cells, we analysed the effects on virus infection of chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine, two pharmacological inhibitors of this pathway (Chu et al., 2006; Leppert et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008). A dose\u2010dependent inhibition of DENV\u20101 internalization (Fig. 3A) and production at 48 h post\u2010infection (p.i.) (Fig. 3B) was obtained in Vero cells treated with both compounds during the first hour of infection, with a maximum reduction of virus internalization to 33% and 29% of control values at concentrations of 50 \u03bcM chlorpromazine and 500 \u03bcM dansylcadaverine respectively. Surprisingly, neither chlorpromazine nor dansylcadaverine treatment produced any inhibitory effect on DENV\u20102 infection (Fig. 3A and B). By the contrary, a significant increase in the number of DENV\u20102 internalized virions and PFU released from infected Vero cells was detected when clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis was blocked (values higher than 100% of control in Fig. 3A and B). The internalization of TRITC\u2010labelled transferrin, a ligand known to enter into the cell by clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, was used as a functional control assay to assess that the action of the inhibitors was effectively exerted on receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis from clathrin\u2010coated pits. In control cells a dotted fluorescence pattern inside the cell cytoplasm was observed, while cultures treated with chlorpromazine exhibited a widespread fluorescence only at the cell surface, indicating that transferrin uptake was efficiently arrested (Fig. 3C). A similar staining pattern was observed after treatment with dansylcadaverine (data not shown). Consequently, results obtained with biochemical inhibitors suggest that DENV\u20101 entry to Vero cells occurs through clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis but DENV\u20102 would use another endocytic route.",

The dominant negative mutant of the clathrin coat\u2010associated cellular protein Eps15 named EH29 specifically interferes with clathrin\u2010coated pit assembly at the plasma membrane without affecting clathrin independent endocytic pathways (Benmerah et al., 1999). Vero cells were transfected with GFP\u2010tagged versions of the dominant negative mutant EH29 (GFP\u2010EH29) and the control construct that does not affect clathrin\u2010mediated uptake (GFP\u2010DIII\u03942) (Benmerah et al., 1998). Twenty\u2010four hours post transfection, cells were infected with DENV\u20101 or DENV\u20102 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then processed to detect GFP expression and internalized viral antigen by indirect immunofluorescence staining. When Vero cells were transfected with the control construct GFP\u2010DIII\u03942 both DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 virions were internalized in endocytic vesicles exhibiting a speckled virus antigen staining within the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). A similar pattern was observed in mutant GFP\u2010EH29 transfected cells after DENV\u20102 infection, indicating that DENV\u20102 was capable of entering Vero cells when clathrin\u2010mediated uptake was blocked (Fig. 3D). In contrast, a slight and disperse red fluorescence at the cell surface, demonstrative of a blockade in virus entry, was detected in GFP\u2010EH29 transfected and DENV\u20101\u2010infected cells, providing additional strong evidence that DENV\u20101 internalization into Vero cells occurs via a clathrin\u2010dependent pathway. The functionality of the construct GFP\u2010EH29 was proved by an assay of transferrin incorporation in transfected cells. As expected, expression of the dominant negative protein, but not of the control, inhibited transferrin uptake (Fig. 3D).",

When the same experimental procedure was performed after DENV\u20101 infection, the ability of Vero cells to be productively infected with this serotype was blocked when clathrin dependent endocytosis was interrupted by the dominant negative mutant transfection, reducing the percentage of DENV\u20101\u2010positive cells from 75.1% of GFP\u2010DIII\u03942 transfected cells to 16.6% of GFP\u2010EH29 transfected cells (Fig. 3E and F). In conclusion, all these data confirm that DENV\u20102 is capable of entering and causing a productive infection in Vero cells lacking a functional clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis whereas the infection of Vero cells with DENV\u20101 requires this endocytic pathway.",

Lipid rafts are cholesterol\u2010 and sphingolipid\u2010rich membrane microdomains used by certain viruses and toxins to enter into the cell (Nichols and Lippincott\u2010Schwartz, 2001; Kirkham and Parton, 2005). Caveolae are vesicles arising from specialized lipid rafts and associated to the protein caveolin (Pelkmans, 2005). The raft/caveolae\u2010dependent pathways are highly sensitive to cholesterol\u2010depleting agents that disrupt the lipid bilayer structure whereas clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis is only affected at high doses (Anderson et al., 1996; Damm et al., 2005).",

            "text": "To determine if any step in DENV\u20102 entry before trafficking to the acidic vesicles was sensitive to perturbation of lipid rafts, we evaluated the effects on virus infection of nystatin and methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin. These sterol\u2010binding drugs sequester cholesterol by extraction, in the case of methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin, or by complex formation at the membrane, in the case of nystatin, blocking the lipid raft\u2010dependent entry pathways (Ilangumaran and Hoessli, 1988; Anderson et al., 1996; Pelkmans et al., 2001). Since this class of compounds can also modify the lipid bilayer of the virus envelope leading to virus inactivation, we first analysed the virucidal effect of nystatin and methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin by incubation of DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 suspensions with different concentrations of the compounds during 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, samples were diluted and remaining infectivity was titrated by PFU in Vero cells. The sample dilution effectively reduced the drug concentration to be incubated with the cells at least 100\u2010fold to assess that any titre reduction was only due to cell\u2010free virion inactivation. As seen in Fig. 4A, methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin exerted a dose\u2010dependent inactivating activity against DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 virions as a probable consequence of envelope alteration by its interaction with cholesterol. Nystatin exerted an inactivating effect against DENV something lower than methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin (data not shown). Based on these results, the treatment conditions to test the effects of the drugs on DENV infection were chosen to affect lipid raft organization of cell membrane but without a direct contact between drug and virions. Thus, Vero cells were pre\u2010incubated with increasing concentrations of nystatin or methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin. Then, monolayers were extensively washed and infected with DENV\u20102 or DENV\u20101, probed as a negative control, in the absence of compound. The pretreatment with the drugs neither affected DENV\u20102 internalization (Fig. 4B) nor DENV\u20102 production in Vero cells at 48 h p.i. (data not shown). As expected for a virus using clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis (Fig. 3), DENV\u20101 internalization was not affected by both inhibitors at the tested concentrations (Fig. 4B). The positive control for the effectiveness of cell treatment with these drugs on lipid raft/caveolae pathways was performed assaying the entry of FITC\u2010labelled cholera toxin, a marker of internalization through this route, after a similar treatment to that used for virus entry assay. Untreated cells showed a clear dotted perinuclear cytoplasmic fluorescence due to the accumulation of the toxin in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; whereas the treatment with nystatin or methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin resulted in a diffuse green fluorescence pattern indicative of the impairment of toxin incorporation (Fig. 4C). The blockade of cholera toxin entry showed that functional lipid rafts were destroyed by drug treatment, while the lack of inhibitory effect on DENV\u20101 infection indicated that the drug concentrations were not as high to affect other endocytic pathways, like the clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. Consequently, it is valid to conclude from these experiments with pharmacological inhibitors that DENV\u20102 entry is independent of lipid rafts/caveolae.",

The fusion of GFP at the N\u2010terminal domain of caveolin\u20101 sequence inhibits the functionality of this protein acting as a dominant negative mutant named GFP\u2010cav\u20101 DN, while the GFP fusion at the C\u2010terminal end does not affect the protein (GFP\u2010cav\u20101 wt) (Pelkmans et al., 2001). More recently, a new form of dominant negative mutant named GFP\u2010cav\u20101 Y14F was generated by a point mutation that prevented caveolin\u20101 phosphorylation (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006). Vero cells were transfected with the wild\u2010type and both mutant forms of caveolin\u20101, and 24 h post\u2010transfection cells were infected with DENV\u20102. After 24 h of infection, cells were fixed and analysed for GFP expression to quantify transfected cells and for immunofluorescence staining against DENV\u20102 antigen to detect infected cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, the expression of the dominant negative mutants of caveolin GFP\u2010cav\u20101 DN and GFP\u2010cav\u20101 Y14F had no effect on the infection of cells with DENV\u20102. The percentage of infection in transgene\u2010expressing cells, determined by scoring cells expressing viral antigens, was similar in cultures transfected with the three caveolin\u20101 constructs (Fig. 4E), and thereby strengthened our conclusion that DENV\u20102 entry was independent of caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis. As expected, the dominant negative mutants of caveolin did not affect the entry of DENV\u20101 into Vero cells (Fig. S2A and B).",

            "text": "Altogether, these results denote a route of infective entry for DENV\u20102 into Vero cells through an endocytic pathway independent of clathrin and lipid rafts/caveolae. In recent years, certain viruses were reported to use similar routes not fully characterized (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002b; Quirin et al., 2008; Rojek et al., 2008). In particular, the participation of dynamin is not clearly elucidated in non\u2010clathrin, non\u2010caveolar pathways (Conner and Schmid, 2003; Cao et al., 2007). Dynamin is a GTPase essential for pinching off vesicles in clathrin\u2010 and caveolae\u2010dependent endocytosis. To probe if dynamin is involved in DENV\u20102 entry into Vero cells the effect of dynasore, a recently developed dynamin inhibitor (Macia et al., 2006), was evaluated. Although the infection of Vero cells with DENV\u20102 was not clathrin\u2010 or caveolin\u2010dependent, treatment with dynasore before and during virus infection significantly reduced DENV\u20102 internalization (Fig. 4F), as well as virus production at 48 h p.i. (data not shown). As a positive control, we determined that the internalization of DENV\u20101 was inhibited by dynasore treatment (Fig. 4F). To confirm the participation of dynamin in DENV\u20102 entry into Vero cells the GFP\u2010tagged versions of the wild\u2010type form of dynamin II GFP\u2010dyn II wt and the dominant negative mutant GFP\u2010dyn II K44A were used (Damke et al., 1994; Oh et al., 1998; Sauvonnet et al., 2005). Vero cells were transfected with both constructs and after 24 h of transfection cells were infected with DENV\u20101 or DENV\u20102. At 24 h p.i., cultures were processed for immunofluorescence. Cells expressing similar levels of GFP\u2010tagged wild\u2010type and mutant forms of dynamin were selected and those stained for viral antigen were scored. As seen in Fig. 4G, DENV\u20102 multiplication was affected in cells expressing the dominant negative mutant, with percentages of infection in GFP\u2010dyn II wt and GFP\u2010dyn II K44A transfected cells of 87% and 16% respectively (Fig. 4H). The expression of mutant dynamin also significantly reduced the infection with DENV\u20101 in the same cell line: in GFP\u2010dyn II wt transfected cells the percentage of infection was about 70% whereas in cells transfected with GFP\u2010dyn II K44A only 15% of cells were infected (Fig. S2C and D). Thus, we can conclude that the infective entry of both serotypes DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 into Vero cells is dependent on dynamin functionality.",

To address the role of actin network in DENV\u20102 entry, we analysed the effects of two drugs, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, which disturb microfilament integrity by actin depolimerization (Rojek et al., 2008), and a third compound, jasplakinolide, which acts by inducing a rigid stabilization of the actin polymer and a blockade of the microfilament dynamics (Rojek et al., 2008). No inhibition was observed on DENV\u20102 multiplication after treatment with these compounds (Fig. 5A). The lack of effect of actin\u2010disturbing agents on DENV\u20102 entry was also assessed in an internalization assay, as shown in Fig. 5C for cytochalasin D, although the effectiveness of the compound to destroy the typical pattern of the actin microfilaments as bundles of thin fibers was observed by staining with FITC\u2010labelled phalloidin (Fig. 5D). Then, data with the different types of inhibitors allowed conclude that the structure and dynamics of the actin microfilaments are not involved in the endocytic DENV\u20102 entry to Vero cells. Additionally, these results represent the first evidence towards the probable exclusion of macropinocytosis or phagocytosis as possible mechanisms of DENV\u20102 internalization. Although neither macropinocytosis nor phagocytosis is frequently involved in virus entry, they have been reported as an alternative access for some viruses in certain cells (Mar\u00e9chal et al., 2001; Clement et al., 2006; Amstutz et al., 2008). These two well\u2010known endocytic routes for cell entry independent of clathrin and caveolae are strictly dependent of the F\u2010actin network (Swanson and Watts, 1995). We intended to obtain further evidence about the role of macropinocytosis by using amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchange at the plasma membrane (Swanson and Watts, 1995), but this compound exerted virucidal activity against DENV\u20102 inactivating cell\u2010free virions (data not shown).",

The treatment of A549 cells with ammonium chloride, chlorpromazine, dansylcadaverine and nystatin was performed in the same conditions of incubation time and drug concentrations as previously described for Vero cells. The assayed range of concentrations was sufficient to induce essentially the same effects on the endocytic pathway in A549 cells in comparison to Vero cells, as determined by the corresponding staining markers (Fig. S3). After drug treatment, cells were infected with DENV\u20102 and further incubated for 48 h, when supernatants were titrated by plaque formation on Vero cells. A dose\u2010dependent and significant reduction in DENV\u20102 infection was detected in A549 cells when endosomal pH was increased by ammonium chloride pretreatment, indicating that a low pH\u2010dependent endocytic route of entry is also used by DENV\u20102 in this mammalian cell line (Fig. 6A). A similar level of dose\u2010dependent inhibition of DENV\u20102 infection was determined in A549 cells treated with both inhibitors of clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine (Fig. 6B and C). Accordingly, lipid rafts/caveolae were not required for the infection of A549 cells with DENV\u20102 since no inhibitory effect was detected by nystatin treatment (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that the entry of DENV\u20102 into A549 cells was dependent on clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis and, consequently, differed from the pathway followed by the same viral serotype in Vero cells, as shown in Fig. 3.",

In addition, infection assays in the presence of entry inhibitors quantitatively confirmed the results from the internalization assays, showing a concomitance in the levels of virus yields or viral antigen expressing cells for DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 with the proposed route of entry. Interestingly, a consistent and significative increase in DENV\u20102 yield was observed when infection was performed in the presence of the two inhibitors of clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine. One possibility is that the clathrin pathway would be a non\u2010infective route of entry for DENV\u20102 in Vero cells and, consequently, when it is blocked there is an enhancement in the utilization by DENV\u20102 virions of the infective non\u2010clathrin pathway, leading to a higher production of infectious virus. Further research is required to ascertain this hypothesis or any other one to explain the results shown in Fig. 3A and B. In comparison, it has recently been shown that papillomaviruses could be internalized without inducing productive infection (Selinka et al., 2007) and, concomitantly, the inhibition of clathrin\u2010and caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis led to an increase of human papillomavirus infectivity through a proposed alternative endocytic mechanism (Spoden et al., 2008). Therefore, the increased infectivity of DENV\u20102 in cells with disturbed clathrin endocytosis may represent an additional support for usage of the non\u2010classical route.",

Clearly, our studies demonstrate that the drug\u2010induced release of cholesterol from virion membranes correlated with a dramatic loss of infectivity whereas cholesterol depletion of cell membranes did not affect subsequent virus infection. Thus, this virucidal activity of cholesterol depleting drugs, also reported for other flaviviruses (Aizaki et al., 2008), may induce a false inference about the role of cellular cholesterol\u2010rich microdomains for fusion and infection.

A different receptor usage may determine the consequential route of entry. A comparative study for DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 receptor in Vero cells has not been performed, but in human liver HepG\u20102 cells two different proteins, the laminin receptor and GRP78, were identified as DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 specific receptors respectively (Jindadamrongwech et al., 2004; Thepparit and Smith, 2004), and also a higher saturation of infection was found for DENV\u20101 respect of DENV\u20102 (Suksanpaisan and Smith, 2003). Another factor that may affect DENV entry is the presence of sugar molecules on the viral surface. The utilization of the two potential N\u2010linked glycosylation sites of E (Asn\u201067 and Asn\u2010153) has been determined for only a limited number of strains and the heterogeneity among circulating virus populations remains uncharacterized (Bryant et al., 2007). Diverse phenotypic changes, such as fusion activity, tropism, virulence and morphogenesis, have been associated with the lack of glycosylation at one or both sites, with a variable behavior in mosquito or mammalian cells (Guirakhoo et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 1994; Bryant et al., 2007; Mondotte et al., 2007). Further studies are needed to reveal if E glycosylation is related to the endocytic via utilized for DENV entry. Finally, after binding, both serotype virions need to be exposed at intravesicular low pH for functional entry (Fig. 2), in accordance with the conformational transition reported for DENV\u20102, DENV\u20103 and DENV\u20101 E glycoprotein under acidic conditions that allow membrane fusion (Kuhn et al., 2002; Modis et al., 2004; Stiasny and Heinz, 2006; Nayak et al., 2009). However, differences between the DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 E post\u2010fusion conformations were reported (Nayak et al., 2009). Interestingly, van der Schaar et al. (2008) found distinct requirements in the endocytic trafficking for two strains of the serotype DENV\u20102 in BSC\u20101 cells: by real\u2010time imaging strain S1 particles fused from within Rab7\u2010positive late endosomes whereas virions of strain NGC fused from Rab5\u2010positive early endosomes. This may reflect a different pH threshold for fusion, a hypothesis that must be also evaluated among DENV serotypes. van der Schaar et al. (2008) also reported that the majority of DENV\u20102 particles had fused from acidic vesicles within 17 min p.i., in accordance with our results showing inhibition of DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 entry after 1 h of infection by the pH\u2010rising effect of ammonium chloride and concanamycin A (Fig. 2A). Future experiments will allow to locate the precise vesicular pH for fusion of both DENV serotypes by monitoring the kinetics of low pH\u2010dependence for entry into Vero cells and the kind of acidic organelle where fusion takes place.",

The blockade of DENV entry into the host cell is an interesting antiviral strategy because it represents a barrier to suppress the beginning of infection (Altmeyer, 2004; Perera et al., 2008). In particular, the studies about the anti\u2010DENV activity of sulfated polysaccharides indicated that virus binding and internalization were blocked by this class of compounds (Talarico and Damonte, 2007; Talarico et al., 2007). A differential susceptibility of DENV serotypes to polysulfates was observed: DENV\u20102 was the most susceptible serotype whereas DENV\u20101 showed very weak inhibition (Lin et al., 2002; Talarico et al., 2005; Talarico and Damonte, 2007). These variations may be ascribed to the differences in virus\u2013cell interactions during entry of DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 into Vero cells here reported. The simultaneous cocirculation of the four DENV serotypes in diverse regions from Asia and America makes mandatory the requirement for a potential antiviral agent to be reactive againtst all serotypes. Therefore, the elucidation of the precise mechanism of internalization for DENV serotypes will provide the opportunity to identify the adequate target for development of effective therapeutic agents.",
