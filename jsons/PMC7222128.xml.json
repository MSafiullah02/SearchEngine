Based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports, Asian adults had the lowest obesity prevalence in 2017 while non-Hispanic black adults (39%) had the highest, followed by American Indian/Alaska Native (38.7%), Hispanic (32.4%), and non-Hispanic White adults (29.3%) [1]. Among proposed etiologies for this disproportionate distribution are socio-economic factors and their effects on nutrition [9], genetic differences [10], and possible ethnic differences in fat metabolism [11]. Additionally, there is evidence of gender disparity with female dominance [12] and unequal utilization of bariatric surgery with fewer African Americans undergoing these procedures compared with Whites [13] despite a higher obesity rate in the former. Furthermore, there is evidence of disparate long-term response to bariatric procedures especially disproportionate success in weight loss among different races [14\u201316].",

They also reported that a 30-day readmission was significantly higher in non-Hispanic Blacks compared with non-Hispanic Whites. African American race has been reported as an independent risk factor for readmission in many other studies as well [22\u201324]. In this study, the majority of readmissions (78%) were associated with the metabolic and bariatric procedure. Despite significant differences in cause of readmission among racial groups, nausea and vomiting, fluid, electrolyte, or nutritional depletion was the most common cause in all groups and the reason for almost one-fourth of all interventions after the primary procedure.",

However, we found results in univariate analyses that are comparable with previous studies. For instance, occurrence of PE was 1.93 times higher in AAs compared with Whites in our study, which may be secondary to a biological predilection, although this is unknown, and is especially puzzling since there were no significant differences in the preoperative rates of venous thromboembolism. This is comparable with the results of a study by Turner and colleagues [25] using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2007 and reported increased rates of certain postoperative complications including 2.5 times higher PE in African American patients. Venous thrombosis was the third most common reason for readmission in AA patients in this study. Notably, preoperative IVC filter was significantly higher in AAs compared with White patients, while the preoperative rates of DVT or PE were not different between these two racial groups. However, over 80% of AAs who had IVC filter preoperatively received it in anticipation of the bariatric procedure as opposed to a pre-existing filter (18%). These findings are not easily explained. The higher mean preoperative BMI in the AA group and possibly anticipated longer operation times could perhaps account for the significantly higher rates of preoperative IVC filter placement in AAs compared with Whites even though the preoperative PE and DVT rates were similar between the groups.",
