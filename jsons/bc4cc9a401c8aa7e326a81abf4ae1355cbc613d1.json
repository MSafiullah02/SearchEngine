Proper assessment of pathogens on water and water quality monitoring are key factors for decision-making regarding water distribution systems' infrastructure, the choice of best water treatment and prevention waterborne outbreaks. Powerful, sensitive and reproducible diagnostic tools are developed to monitor pathogen contamination in water and be able to detect not only cultivable pathogens but also to detect the occurrence of viable but non-culturable microorganisms as well as the presence of pathogens on biofilms. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a helpful tool to evaluate the scenarios for pathogen contamination that involve surveillance, detection methods, analysis and decision-making.

Furthermore, since there is a broad environmental distribution of human pathogens that exist in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state such as E. coli, Helicobacter pylori and V. cholerae, false negative results may arise from culture dependent methods [27, 28] . In both culture and molecular methods, index pathogens for monitoring water quality have been selected in order to indicate the presence of a large amount of pathogens in water. Among these, E. coli ( Figure 1 ) has been extensively used due to the fact that detection methods for these pathogens are relatively easy and inexpensive; nonetheless, they may have the disadvantage of not providing information on their host origin and, sometimes, they do not correlate with other pathogens present in the water, such as the viruses and protozoa. Thus, water characterized as pathogen-free by monitoring E. coli, for example, may be contaminated with viruses or protozoa [31] . Molecular methods can be very specific for particular species and provide further phylogenetic information about pathogens [32] . These methods allow the use of alternatives indicators which easily relate with the host source. This permits the discrimination between human and animal pathogens and tracking the source of pollution [29, 31] . It has been suggested that host-origin libraries, based on a phenotypic methods, may be useful for tracking the pathogen source but the development of such libraries may incur a significant cost [8] . Therefore, molecular methods seem to better suited for health risk assessments.",

The dual-labeled fluorescent probes such as TaqMan probe and the fluorescent dye SYBR green are the most used techniques for detecting pathogens [68] . qPCR approach has been used to quantify human pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7 [69] , and Campylobacter spp., [70] .

However, most of these methods can only detect and quantify one pathogen in a single reaction [71] . Ishii and co-workers [39, 71] designed a microfluidic qPCR by using TaqMan probes (hydrolysis probe-based qPCR) labeled with different fluorophores that can detect L. monocytogenes, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, Pseudogulbenkiana sp., S. typhimurium, S. flexneri, C. perfringens and pathogenic E. coli at levels of detection of 100 cells/L.

Microarrays are made up of glass slides or chips coated with specific oligonucleotide probes which are chemically synthesized short sequences (25 to 80 bp) [28, 78] . Microarray technology allows the rapid detection of multiple genes of multiple organisms simultaneously in the sample due its capacity for screening large numbers of sequences [32] , has high throughput capacity and is able to be automated. Therefore, large-scale and data-intensive experiments are performed in microarrays [4, 28] . Microarrays have also the ability to detect antimicrobial resistance to different antibiotics, and the probes could be designed for detecting the host origin of contaminants, which represents another advantage for characterization of contamination in water. However, advanced molecular technologies such as microarrays could experience difficulties distinguishing between viable and non-viable cells, have a relatively high cost, and may have non-specific hybridization resulting in a lower specificity and low sensitivity [32] .",

Through these steps, signal sensitivity increased around 10 6 -fold [79] . Nonetheless, the PCR-microarray technique might lack sensitivity when the amount of sample is limited, since the technique requires splitting the samples into several PCR reactions to amplify [50] . DNA microarray in a two-step PCR-DNA microarray assay that first amplifies the 16S or 18S rRNA gene, respectively, followed by hybridization of these products onto a low-density DNA microarray was developed to detect most of the common waterborne protozoan pathogens including C. parvum, G. intestinalis, Acanthamoeba spp., Entamoeba histolytica, and Naegleria spp. [48, 49] . In 2002, Wilson and co-workers [46] were able to identify 18 pathogenic bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses by using species-specific primer sets to amplify multiple diagnostic regions unique to each individual pathogen in the microarray. Inoue and co-workers [80] studied the occurrence of 941 pathogenic bacterial species in groundwater and were able to distinguish between human and animal sources.",

Pyrosequencing technology provides a large number of sequences read in a single run [90] . In the pyrosequencing reaction, the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase are needed. The nucleotides are added to form the complementary strand of the single-stranded template, to which a sequencing primer is annealed. During the nucleotide incorporation, the pyrophosphate (PPi) is released. ATP sulfurylase converts the PPi into ATP and the ATP is then converted to visible light by luciferase and the produced light signal is detected [87, 90] . The methodology includes a primary step of concentrating the water pathogens followed by a secondary concentration depending of the type of the pathogen. The third step involves DNA extraction (for bacteria and protozoa) and nuclease treatment (viral DNA/RNA extraction). Then, the DNA is amplified, the pyrosequencing is taking place and finally the analysis and bioinformatics can be performed [87, 90] .",

FISH is made with specific probes that target 16rRNA labeled with fluorescent dye. The sample is stained by 4,-diamino-2-pheynyl indole (DAPI) that is bound to double-stranded DNA to count the total amount of cells in the samples, and the results are compared to culture methods to measure the proportion of VBNC cells [103] . Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli in drinking water systems, freshwater and river water have been detected by this tool [103] .",

SNT test has been used for the serotyping of viruses and involves mixing a sample, extracted from a plaque assay, with antiserum and then assessing the decrease of infectivity by plaque assay [112] . Assays based on immunofluorescence and immunomagnetic separation (IMS) are used to detect protozoan parasites. The US Environment Protection Agent (EPA) has established method 1623.1 for the combined detection of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., or method 1622 for Cryptosporidium spp., both of which use IMS followed by immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy [113, 114] .

The approach combines dose response information for the infectious agent with information on the distribution of exposures routes and is able to demonstrate if the health targets are met in a drinking water distribution system [123] , which are suggested to be a health risk less than one infection per 10,000 individuals per year, or, a disease burden of 10 \u22126 disability adjusted life year (DALY) per person per year [3] .

It comprises data of illness, secondary transmission and immunity in population. Typically, the dose-response is derived from studies of exposure of human volunteers to different doses of the pathogen or is based on previous outbreaks [127] [128] [129] . Factors influencing the dose-response are the exposure route, exposure medium pathogen strain host endpoint and the data source. Two commonly models are the beta-Poisson model and the exponential model, described elsewhere [2, 125, 130] ; (iv) Risk characterization is the integration of information from hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure assessment to estimate the magnitude of health effects; (v) Risk management and communication is a decision-making process based in all previous steps in risk assessment [2, [125] [126] [127] [128] .",

The advantage of probabilistic modeling is to distribute the uncertainties through the model [133] . The QMRA approach presents potential advantages and limitations of risk management options that could be evaluate by numerical stimulations to investigate their possible efficacy, and that risk below epidemiologically detectable levels may be estimated under specific circumstances [134] . However, the greatest limitation on QMRA is the lack of available data to carry out this assessment [134] . QMRA also depends on the method used for monitoring pathogens in water. Actually, QMRA approach is based exclusively on data obtained by cultivation methods, which are not allowing the complete characterization of risk, since as mentioned above, many waterborne microorganisms are not culturable or are inefficiently cultured, thus leading to underestimation of pathogens in water. Therefore, selecting the optimal tool for pathogen monitoring in source water that gives the necessary information on occurrence, prevalence, virulence, and even viability of the pathogens influences the results of the QMRA approach.",

QMRAspot uses four index pathogens: Campylobacter, enterovirus, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia [143] . Also, a software infrastructure name FRAMEs (Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems) have been created to assess the water health risk which allows describing the problem statement, integrating models and data-bases, and provides the infrastructure for performing sensitivity, variability and uncertain analyses [131] .",
