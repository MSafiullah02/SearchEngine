As of the beginning of April, Italy has reported one of the highest number of infections and the highest number of deaths of any European country. 5 Media reports from across Italy have shone a light on the burden that the coronavirus is placing on health workers. Nearly ten percent of reported coronavirus infections in Italy occurred in healthcare workers. 6 7 As of April 14, 162.488 cases and 21,067 deaths attributed to COVID-19 were confirmed in the country, and the number of healthcare workers infected and those that lost their life due to COVID-19 was 14,066 and 133 respectively. Many of these infections are likely due to occupational hazard; workers becoming infected while caring for patients suggesting the shortage or inappropriate use of PPE may be at the root of part of these infections.",

            "text": "The use of PPE has been identified as one of the biggest physical and psychological challenges experienced by physicians while responding to COVID-19. 7 For example, physical burdens related to PPE include repeated donning and doffing of equipment and extended hours wearing uncomfortable masks and respirators, while psychological burdens include challenges communicating with peers and patients when wearing PPE on and operating under changed practice standards. Because of PPE shortages, healthcare workers, who may have been trained on how to don and doff PPE to maximize protection from infection, have had to make ad hoc adjustments on what piece of equipment to use and when, that are not reflected in any training they have received. The additional burdens created by a shortage whereby processes for using PPE are continuously changing, has not been explored. The Italian healthcare system is regionally based and organized at the national, regional, and local levels, with each region having the autonomy of managing the delivery of the healthcare services based on local needs. 8 Italian National Health Service system certifies healthcare workers and requires continuing education and quality and standards of care are set by the regions and hospitals. Training procedures for the healthcare workforce are also left to the regions and local hospitals, specifically regarding the management of PPE. Such differences are expected given local needs and hospital settings differ by localities, however such differences may also have caused inconsistencies and confusion on the appropriate use of PPE in a rapidly evolving situation such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently, there is lack of literature on how the healthcare workforce in Italy has adapted during the Novel Coronavirus pandemic in the use of equipment. This study aimed to understand physicians' access to PPE, reception of information about their use, ability to perform donning and doffing procedures, risk perception and strategies adopted to prevent contracting the infection. We believe the results of our work may be helpful in the development of policies and training related to the use of PPE in Italy as well as in other countries.",

We combined all responses for each piece of equipment into a scoring system to create a new variable named \"ability to perform donning and doffing procedures\" , we then dichotomized the variable into high ability when the score was 75th percentile and less than high when below the 75th percentile). Finally, to measure risk perception we asked 4) What do you believe is your risk of contracting COVID-19 in the work setting in the next 30 days? physicians rated their perception using a scale ranging from 0=no risk to 100=high risk, responses were coded as follows: 1= low risk (\u2264 25th percentile), 2=medium risk (26th-85th percentile) and 3=high risk (\u226575th percentile). We first performed descriptive statistics for each variable. We then applied ordered logistic regression to the three ordinal variables access to PPE, information on PPE use, and donning and doffing ability and logistic regression to the variable risk perception. We tested for bivariate associations between each predictor (years of experience, geographic region, type of position, working in a dedicated COVID-19 unit) and the dependent variables using a p-value \u2264 0.25 as cut-off as inclusion criteria for the multiple regression model.

While our results are not generalizable to the all population of Italian physicians, and certainly derived from a group of physicians with high level of interest in COVID-19, group differences within our sample rather than general group estimates by extrapolation, can be useful to understand predictors of behaviors and specific challenges in access and use of PPE. The majority of those surveyed reported not to have access to PPE every time they need it and at least one third of them reported not having received adequate information on the use of the equipment, nor were they consistently comfortable with donning and doffing procedures, in particular when using respirators and wearing gowns. Working in a COVID unit made a difference in multivariate analysis of both having access to PPE, adequate information on their use, feeling comfortable with donning and doffing procedures, and perceived risk. This likely reflects training efforts focused on educating this subset of the workforce, those actually at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19 based on occupational risk. However, given the difficulties of creating 100% COVID-19 free clinics as many patients may present to a clinic in a pauci-symptomatic status, the current variation in access and knowledge about PPE use, may put at a disproportionate risk those working outside COVID-19 units.

Limited training as well as pre-existing professional norms that lacked a culture of PPE use may have been factors that shaped challenges in developing adequate training and information material. We suggest that future efforts should be made to include PPE training in the medical curriculum so that in times of crisis physicians can better adapt to their use and differences in knowledge and practices would be less evident across categories. Methods for just-in-time training including the use of video trainings may be one mechanism to improve donning and doffing procedures. 11 In times of crisis, an overuse and gauging of PPE by concerned physicians may cause as much harm as lack of supplies.",

The majority of the respondents (73%) reported to have taken precautions at home to keep their family safe; examples consisted in removing and washing their clothes upon arrival at home and wearing a surgical mask, sleeping in a separate room, not sharing utensils and keeping a physical distance from family members. Interestingly, none reported to check their body temperature at home.
