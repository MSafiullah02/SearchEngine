The main objective of the present study was to develop a hybrid decisionmaking approach with geographic information systems to integrate spatial and non-spatial data to form a weighted result. This study involved three-tier analyses for assessing accessibility and selecting suitable sites for healthcare facilities, and analysing shortest-path network. The first tier of analysis stressed the spatial distance, density and proximity from existing healthcare to find more deprived and inaccessible areas in term of healthcare facilities. The result revealed that spatial discrepancy exists in the study area in term of access to healthcare facilities and for achieving equal healthcare access, it is essential to propose new plans. Thus, require finding suitable sites for put forward new healthcare service, which was highlighted in the second tier of analysis based on land use land cover, distancing to road and rail, proximity to residential areas, and weighted overlay of accessibility as decision factors. Finally, in the third tier of analysis, the most suitable site among the proposed healthcare was identified using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The road network analysis was also performed in this study to determine the shortest and fastest route from these healthcare facilities to connect with district medical hospital. The present study found some suitable sites throughout the district on inaccessible zones where people are deprived from better healthcare facilities. This attempt will highly helpful for preparing a spatial decision support system which assists the health authorities regarding the healthcare services in inaccessible, underprivileged, and rural areas.",

            "text": "Many studies attempt various techniques to get a clear understanding of the accessibility to healthcare centre and to delineate the deprived regions of these healthcare facilities [10] . Geospatial techniques are widely used in different field of studies related to healthcare for maximizing the geographical accessibility to medical services [11] . GIS is a platform which provides a framework in relation to the population for both assessments of the distribution of healthcare centres and evaluation of effective coverage [12] . Spatial or geographical accessibility generally refers to the physical access of a user to a provider's location [13] or simply reflect the linkages between the point of supply and point of demand by taking consideration of existing transport framework and travel impedance [14] . Accessibility is a multidimensional concept which inherent both spatial dimension such as availability, accessibility and non-spatial dimensions like affordability, acceptability and accommodation [15, 16] . Khan [16] highlighted the vehicular travel time/distance and Euclidean distance for characterising spatial attributes to measure spatial accessibility. Spatial separation based model is a suitable approach when there is incomplete and lacking transport network data and give desirable result for accessibility operation by using the physical distance between infrastructures as it only uses the location of services of interest [17] . Cumulative opportunity or isochrones approach is an effective method as it considers the elements of travel time as well as maximum desirable travel time by capturing land use pattern and infrastructural barrier across the land cover. Gravity Model is another model for operating accessibility provides the size of the zone of interest, the configuration of the zone, choice of attractor variables and the values of travel impedance time. Besides these approaches, the two-step floating catchment area was (2SFCA) proposed by Luo and Wang for calculating spatial accessibility [18] . In this method, a floating catchment area is selected as a window to measure serviceto-population ratio for each healthcare service. After that, the entire ratio is summed up for each point of location within the catchment area and use it as an accessibility index of that location. Enhanced two steps floating catchment area method come to overcome the rigidity and arbitrariness of the 2SFCA i.e. it does not take into account the distance decay method, it sets catchment and subzones of healthcare by considering travel time or travel distance based on the road network is often used as the spatial barrier or impedance [19] . Three steps floating catchment area method used by Rekha et al. [1] to calculate accessibility by considering three attributes namely attractiveness of health services, travel time and distance between the location of the service centre and the location of residents and population demand for healthcare facilities.",

GIS is one of the sophisticated spatial analyst techniques that not only potential to identify demand flexible points based on residential clustering but also pinpoint spatial inequalities in healthcare delivery points and provide suitable locations for new health facilities [11] . The geographical dimension of access can be authentically expressed by GIS and appreciate the fact that GIS technique has potential to fit in a wide range of aspects such as identification of vulnerable population who are devoid of service reach, delimit the points of quality service and treatment without looking at the loopholes in previous qualitative research [21] . Several studies found that GIS technique is very useful in the demarcation of nearest healthcare centre for different road network by using patient's postal/zip code and converted then into grid reference to find straight line or travel time distance [11, 22] . Geographical information system applied to measure the relative importance of distance on providers to gain treatment for depression and also tried to understand the barriers regarding the adaptation of such medical facilities in rural as well as urban areas [23] . Distance and travel time are the most important factor for serving people because the number of death increases with increasing travel time to a hospital in a region [24] . GIS offers a distance tool to estimate travel time between healthcare and residential premises and also deals with the shortest and fastest path analysis to reach nearby healthcare in a short time interval.",

The district has a large concentration of minority population which accounts 66% of the total population of the state where the majority are Muslims; the sex ratio is 957 per 1000 males and literacy is 67.53% with a male and female literacy rate of 69.95 and 63.09 respectively. This district is a rural unit and a large number of the total workers accounts for 34.77% of the total population engaged in other works such as labourer [26] , followed by agricultural labourers i.e. 32.52% and household industry workers contributing to 17.99%. The above statistics on literacy, male-female ratio of literacy, and worker pattern indicate that this region is not well developed in term education and occupation. As far as the healthcare facilities are concerned, the district depicts a deprived health service profile where only one medical college and hospital is situated with a bed occupancy rate of 139.8. There is only three super-specialist hospital and four sub-division hospitals are present with a bed occupancy rate of 97.5 and 127.55 respectively [27] . Rural hospital and public healthcare are also available but the service qualities are not well. Moreover, the accessibility of these healthcare facilities is also a vital concern and need to bring focus on proper access to present institutions and also the elimination of disparity region.",

Geographical accessibility and availability of healthcare services contain spatial dimension which can be analysed by geographical information system while the rest two i.e. affordability and acceptability are non-spatial dimensions. Many types of research have been done to achieve higher accessibility to healthcare service mainly under the four notions: distance from the system works under two concepts i.e. nearest service centre to the population and average distance to the set of service centres, the threshold of the service, gravitational models for providers. Distance is the major element to calculate higher accessibility to the service. Sometimes it can be measured trough nearest location to the population, travel cost, travel time. Nearest the location of a service centre lesser the travel time and will minimize the travel cost, ultimately provide higher accessibility. Travel cost and the travel time will also be considered as an important element to measure the non-spatial dimension. Geographical information system (GIS) studies commonly used Euclidean distance method to calculate nearest the location of a service centre i.e. distance from a population centre [1] . This method faces drawback to provide suitable site mainly in urban areas where the population enjoys sets of service options within a certain point or point of reference. Thus, average travel impedance to the service will be suited to ensure spatial accessibility as it incorporates both the entities; accessibility and availability to the population. The threshold of the service can be calculated by several patients per medical institutions. It also refers to the supply options which incorporates doctor-patient ratio, number of bed per person. This method can be shown by density analysis (Point, Line, Kernel density) in GIS researches. This method also has some demerits as it does not consider the cross-border population demand to reference supply point. The gravity model is an updated version on Newton's law of gravity to analyse the spatial accessibility. This model overcomes the problems associated with former dimensions. It incorporates accessibility and availability of services within both rural and urban settings. It also helps to set the potential supply options to a certain set of potential population point.

Firstly, relative accessibility index (RAI) has been estimated based on the existing situation and available data on no. of the medical institution, number of patients and number of doctors i.e. doctor-patient ratio. The RAI of health care facilities is the indication of the areal proportion of health facilities which help in analysing accessibility and inaccessibility. For the same, Euclidean distance, kernel density and proximate had been analysed to support suitability analysis of healthcare sites using the weighted linear combination. Parallelly, TOPSIS was applied to ascertain the most suitable sites where new health care facilities could be built to reach maximum people to provide better health service. Finally, the shortest path network analysis was measured to connect and interlinked between existing and proposed healthcare.

Site suitability is a process of allocation of new and ideal sites by analysing exiting site structure, pattern and condition based on several appropriate criteria. For this determination, the present study had prepared a suitable model for understanding appropriate location by integrating different thematic layers like road accessibility, railway network, land use land cover, and residential density. All these maps have been converted into raster so that each pixel can detect a score. It is important in suitability analysis to set a score for each category at 1-5 or 1-9 point scale as per their suitability. Thematic maps were combined into composite suitability. For suitability analysis, first of all, land use land cover has been classified. Barren, fellow land and low economic and less resourceful land has been considered for highly suitable to allocate new health care. Secondly, the rail network and road accessibility have been considered for merging with the above-mentioned land category. Areas properly connected through road and rail was taken as a suitable site for such allocation. Parallelly, residential accessibility was also taken, 5 km buffer of areas having high population get more preference for suitable sites. This decision approach supported to propose 8 suitable sites for allocating new health care facilities in inaccessible areas. Among this which site is best suitable and where argent requires for allocating new health care is determined using TOPSIS analysis.",

Healthcare accessibility in this district is always a major issue as most of the inhabitants prefer to gain health services due to poor and inefficient access to medical care. The present study aims to explore the suitable site for medical institution after analysing the present situation of healthcare facilities within the district. For the existing situation of health care facilities, the relative accessibility index (RAI) was calculated by considering no. of medical institutions, no.of patients admitted in a year, and no.of doctors available per day. The result of the existing situation of health care facility reveals that the spatial distribution is not uniform throughout the district (Fig. 2) . Hence, for better treatment and getting well service, the resident has to travel another place after crossing a long distance, whereas, many suitable conditions for developing better service have already existed here. The numbers of medical institutions have clustered at the central part of the district i.e. the district capital, Behrampore. As a result, the residents of the other areas are suffered to get better facilities. Thus, the present study was carried out to find suitable locations for health care service by developing a hybrid decision model. For the same, the decision hierarchy was developed using existing facilities of health service, their spatial distance, density and proximity to support the suitable places; where better and well-accommodated health care service would be proposed by considering the local land use and distance to transportation route. After getting selected the proposed sites for local health care service, these are linked with district medical college and hospital located at the central part using shortest path network analysis. This effort will offer better health service to the residents reside at the peripheral part of the district and interlinked with medical college and hospital.",

Thus, from the overall spatial result of the relative accessibility index, it can be decided that the study area is poor in term of medical facilities and health care services. Thus, looking towards this problematic issue, the present study proposed a hybrid decision model with three tiers of analysis to find suitable places for new health care and shortest distance to interlink with the district medical hospital. The first tier of analysis highlighted the distance, density and proximate of each existing health care to find more deprived and inaccessible areas in term of health service. The second tier of analysis emphasized to find suitable sites for proposing new health care services based on land use land cover, distance to road, rail, and proximity to residential areas. Finally, the third tier of analysis highlighted the most suitable sites among the proposed health care and network analysis through the shortest path to connect with district medical hospital. Figure 3a illustrates the prevailing conditions of health care services including medical college, hospital and nursing home. There are only one medical college and hospital is available. There are some other hospitals and nursing home also available both governmental and public but the spatial equality or homogeneity is not found. Figure 3b -d show the distance, density and proximate to present healthcare facilities respectively. The result from each layer of distance, density and proximate reveal that the peripheral parts of the district have always lower facilities. The lower distance to healthcare indicates higher accessibility; lower density of healthcare indicates lower accessibility and closer to healthcare shows higher accessibility. These three spatial layers integrated to consider the accessibility and inaccessibility to healthcare facilities throughout the study area. The 1-5 point scale was used for linear combination i.e. 1 for low accessibility (inaccessibility) and 5 for higher accessibility of healthcare facility. Figure 4 shows the overlay result. It depicts the higher and lower spatial accessibility. This result supports the second tier of analysis i.e. to find suitable sites for proposing new healthcare facilities in inaccessible areas.",

Any healthcare that is located nearer to the railway, it will be considered as most accessible because of getting immediate and fast service. Land use land cover should be considered before going to choose any space for locating health care. Barren land and agricultural fellow nearer to the settlement would be the best site because this site will offer lower land price, utilization of land, and also getting close to residential areas. The sites that are located within 5 km distance to populated areas The maps are produced with the help of data illustrated in Table 1 . will get the best service. Thus, looking towards these conditions, 8 suitable sites were proposed in the present study which can offer health service in inaccessible areas (Fig. 6) . The proposed health care in a suitable site can be merged and interlinked with existing health care to make the district enrich and accessible in term of health service. This is figured in supplementary file (S-1). It is essential to validate the location of each proposed site by verifying ground truth. In the present study, site-1 and site-3 were validated through the ground visit. But the rest sites were not visited; instead, their ground truth was measured in Google Earth search engine.

Hence, the far distance from district medical college has the highest require score in comparison to located nearer distance. The shortest path network analysis reveals that site-1 and 5 are located far distance with 64.24 and 47.27 km respectively which indicate more requirements to manage and construct new health care to offer better service to deprived groups of people. In comparison to site-7 and 4 is much closer with 17.92 and 26.28 km correspondingly which indicate not a big issue would arise in case of not building new health care facilities (Table 4 ; Fig. 8 ).",

But recently, the rapid growth of population and enormous pressure on land, make the service worse. Thus, the present study aimed to emphasize healthcare accessibility issues based on service and accommodation available in the study area. The study area, Murshidabad district is a backward district of West Bengal, India in term of basics infrastructural facilities and amenities [37] . Hence, the present study on healthcare accessibility and site suitability are required to highlight Previous attempts evidenced that several studies defined accessibility in term of availability, accommodation, affordability, and sometimes acceptability [38] . For example, Aday and Andersen [39] defined healthcare accessibility based on the availability of health services with special reference to financial, informational, and behavioural influences. Unlike, Gulliford et al. [40] focused on health demand by highlighting differentiation between having access to healthcare and gaining access to healthcare for overcoming the financial and organizational barriers from health service. All in all, other studies also evidenced common factors for determining healthcare accessibility like (1) spatial distribution of healthcare facilities; (2) transportation facilities and distance to healthcare centres; (3) socio-economic conditions of nearing population group; and (4) accommodation available in healthcare centres [41] . Based on these above-mentioned factors; recently, major concerns have been giving on geographic information system (GIS) applications in the field of healthcare accessibility due to its efficiency and accuracy in spatial as well as non-spatial analysis [38, 42] .",

This study offered a hybrid decision-making approach for proposing suitable sites regarding better healthcare service. To provide better service and reach a deprived group of people, a pipe dream was prepared that needs for logical decision making and resolve existing problems. The result reveals that spatial discrepancy exists in case of access to healthcare facilities. The location of existing healthcare primarily clusters in the central and northern portions. The distance, density and proximate analysis of these healthcares explored the spatial inaccessible areas. To achieve equal access, allocation of new healthcare is essential to reduce the spatial disparity. Thus, the equal weight-based weighted linear combination was performed using land use, proximity to road and rail, and distance to residential areas to support suitable site for determining and allocating new healthcare facilities.",

The advantages of developing and using a hybrid model are (1) it integrates different models and approach, (2) it increases the accuracy of the result and reduces the drawbacks of single model and method, (3) it interlinks two or more aspects of a study, for instance, in case of the present study using a hybrid model two aspects, i.e. accessibility to healthcare and site suitability of healthcare have been determined, and (4) hybrid model helps in simplifying the complex relationship of among criteria or perspective. However, a hybrid model also suffers from some disadvantages, like (1) it is more complex to apply (2) the preparation of model take more times than single model (3) sometimes it also suffers from overfitting etc. Therefore, removing such disadvantages and adopting the abovementioned advantages, the present proposed and used a hybrid model to show healthcare accessibility and site suitability. This study would appear like a good source of health service enhancement and plan implementation to policymakers and health planners. Recently, not only our country but the world worried about the outbreak of 'novel coronavirus'. The government truly finds enormous space for 'isolation' service. Globally 2, 193 ,558 confirmed cases are reported (till 17.04.2020). India is no exception in this case, where, 13,495 confirmed cases are identified. It is assumed that Murshidabad is also too much vulnerable as there is a lack of basic infrastructure. Therefore, in this regards, it is recommended that Government and local planners can start medical emergency in proposed sites with primary equipment and service to reach target population groups. On getting success in the mission, modern infrastructural development and service could be proposed afterwards. ",
