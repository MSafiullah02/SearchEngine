To determine whether prednisolone is effective in rhinovirus-or enterovirus-induced recurrent wheezing, we conducted a controlled trial comparing oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 3 days) with placebo in hospitalized wheezing children and studied post hoc virus-specific efficacy in early wheezing (<3 episodes, reported elsewhere) and in recurrent wheezing ( \u20213 episodes). Virus-negative children where excluded. Our primary endpoint was the time until children were ready for discharge. Secondary endpoints included oxygen saturation and exhaled nitric oxide during hospitalization, duration of symptoms, blood eosinophil count, and impulse oscillometry 2 wk after discharge, and occurrence of relapses during the following 2 months. Virus-specific effects were analyzed with interaction analysis in a multivariate regression model. During the study period, 661 patients were hospitalized, 293 randomized, and 59 were accepted in this analysis (mean age 2.6 yr, s.d. 1.3). Prednisolone did not significantly decrease the time until ready for discharge in all patients (prednisolone vs. placebo, medians, 18 vs. 24 h, p \u00bc 0.11). However, prednisolone decreased the time until ready for discharge in children with picornavirus infection (respectively, 12 vs. 24 h, p \u00bc 0.0022) and more specifically, in children with enterovirus infection (6 vs. 35 h, p \u00bc 0.0007). In the secondary endpoints, prednisolone decreased the duration of cough and dyspnea in rhinovirus-affected children (p \u00bc 0.033 for both).

The rapid resolution of wheezing (median of 18 h in our children) makes it difficult to demonstrate a decrease in hospitalization time.

We argue that the experimental infections in adults with mild asthma are not comparable to natural viral infection in children, especially to moderate-to-severe cases necessitating hospitalization. Children susceptible to rhinovirus-induced moderate-to-severe wheezing may not just present a case of any viral illness. Instead, these cases may reveal children with underlying immunologic anomaly predisposing them to more severe outcome of rhinovirus infections (26, 27) .

As a result of difficulties designing picornavirus-specific studies in children, our analyses were carried out post hoc. The power calculation was based on RSV-infection, because previous data on rhinovirus-specific efficacy were not available. The final sample size was quite small, and it could account for some negative findings, e.g., the efficacy associated with atopy and increased blood eosinophils. Despite intensive search, the detection of other than respiratory picornavirus infections was low. It is the most likely reason for the prolonged time until ready for discharge in non-picornavirus-affected children receiving prednisolone when compared with placebo. The reliability of a positive PCR test in the detection of an active viral infection may be questioned (1) . We have previously shown in our wheezing patients that cases of positive picornavirus PCR markedly decreased within 2-3 wk and disappeared within 5-6 wk after acute wheezing, suggesting that PCR positivity is related to acute infection (31) . In the current study, viral load was not assessed. Balanced randomization was lost because of exclusion of many subjects before analysis. It should be noted that virusspecific results come from various subgroup analyses and are only secondary outcomes. Finally, we studied only hospitalized children receiving abundant bronchodilating medication and excluded children requiring intensive care.
