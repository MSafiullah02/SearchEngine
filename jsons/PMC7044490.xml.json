Over the last ten years, the capacity of NNI had progressively increased and so did the number of patients treated for CNS tumors. The rates, trends, and epidemiology of primary CNS tumors at the NNI remain mostly unknown. To understand the current epidemiology of primary CNS tumors in Saudi Arabia, reports that describe the disease according to international reporting standards are needed. There are only a few to define an institution-based frequency or incidence rate of primary CNS in different Saudi Arabian regions [6\u20139].",

Previous two studies carried out at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) revealed that astrocytoma was more prevalent in the Western region [6, 11]. In the Egyptian pediatric population, the most common intracranial tumors were astrocytomas (35%) followed by medulloblastomas (18.8%). Pilocytic astrocytomas constituted 55% of all astrocytomas and 19.3% of all brain tumors, only slightly ahead of medulloblastomas [18]. The most common tumor found in a Syrian childhood population was medulloblastoma (27.5%), followed by astrocytoma (25.8%) [19]. The lack of ICD-O-3 histology coding in most of these previous works could have resulted in the discrepancy between different studies in different populations.",

The Saudi Cancer Registry used a malignancy-based statistical approach where pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I) were omitted, which explains the higher frequency of medulloblastoma in their registry. Our institution had relatively lower rates of glial neoplasms in general (42.97%) and particularly pilocytic astrocytomas (15.3%). Many of the pilocytic astrocytomas were likely decompressed or excised in their original secondary hospitals while most of the medulloblastomas require gross total resection and referral to a tertiary center such as the NNI. The high-grade gliomas are likely underrepresented in our study since the methodology is pathology-driven and most high-grade gliomas are not biopsied (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma). The referral bias and the pathology-driven methodology could have contributed, in whole or in part, to the relatively higher rates of medulloblastoma in our study.",
