Although wild bird borne infections can occur at any spatial scale, from very localized, to short and long distance, from an epidemiologic point of view the transmission of pathogens from wild birds to humans over a long distance is most important. Therefore, in the current manuscript we focused more on the role of wild migratory birds in the spread of certain pathogens. The paper focuses on available evidence of transmission of avian borne pathogens to humans. We speculated that such evidence would originate from enhanced animal and human surveillance and the application of advanced molecular diagnostic testing during the recent years. Furthermore, we attempted to identify factors potentially contributing to such transmission from the available body of science.",

Transmission to humans was classified as direct if there was evidence for direct transmission of the pathogen from the avian species to humans through direct contact with an infected bird and genetic/serological evidence of the presence of a particular pathogen in both the avian species and humans. Transmission to humans was classified as indirect if there was evidence for transmission of the pathogen from the avian species to humans through indirect contact with an infected bird and genetic/serological evidence of the presence of the particular pathogen in both the avian species and humans. We considered indirect ways of transmission, those through contaminated water from feces of waterfowls and through vectors that are carried by wild birds such as mosquitoes and ticks (\nTable 1). Finally, we classified pathogens to be associated with a \u201ctheoretical risk for transmission\u201d when in the literature there were reports that these pathogens were isolated both from humans and wild birds, using microbiological, genetic or serological methods, but there were no reports of actual direct/indirect transmission of these pathogens from wild birds to humans. Despite the lack of actual evidence in such cases, the risk exists in theory e.g. through ingestion of water contaminated from feces of wild birds or exposure to inanimate surfaces contaminated by bird secretions or droppings.",

Unfortunately, in the vast majority of the reports reviewed herein, data were unavailable to further characterize the way of transmission of certain pathogens beyond the stage of a speculative argument. This would be expected for zoonoses which usually require amplification in an animal species cycle before spill-over to humans. Nevertheless and based on our criteria several avian borne bacterial, fungal, viral pathogens could be indirectly transmitted or associated with a theoretical risk for transmission to humans (Table 1). We identified 58 such pathogens for which wild birds can serve as reservoirs, mechanical vectors, or both (\nTable 1, Table 2). However, the paucity of available data did not allow us to make the distinction whether the involved species serve as reservoir or vector in most of the cases.",

A major source of wild bird\u2013human contact is hunting and the cleaning of killed birds. Often birds are field-dressed by hunters with minimal protection bringing them in contact with blood, organs and feces.30 Serologic evidence of avian influenza infection in hunters and wildlife professionals has been reported.56 In addition, occupational exposure to avian species (e.g veterinarians) may increase risk of infections like avian influenza virus infection. Indirect infection may occur through the same routes if wild birds transmit the infection to domestic animals, e.g. poultry or via exposure to inanimate surfaces contaminated by bird secretions or droppings. Transfer of infected material can happen with shoes, clothing or other inanimate objects.",

            "text": "Wild birds when serving as reservoirs exhibit multiplication of the pathogen within their organism. Aggregations of bird species that occur during certain periods within the avian annual cycle may enable transmission of pathogens between individuals. Extreme examples for such aggregations can be found at moulting and staging areas of eared grebes Podiceps nigricollis,135, 136 at roosting sites for European starlings Sturnus vulgaris, at landbridges between continents (e.g. Gibraltar, Bosporus) widely used by soaring and gliding species like larger birds of prey and white storks Ciconia ciconia and at breeding sites of many seabirds. In terms of numbers, the vast amount of migratory birds do migrate solitarily in \u2018broad front\u2019 and therefore do not encounter an increased risk of pathogen transmission, while some species travel hundreds to thousands of kilometres from their breeding grounds and re-fuel at distinct stopover sites.137 These \u201cstaging areas\u201d provide the opportunity for close intermingling of species that are otherwise widely separated during the major part of the year.35, 138 Thus, the theoretical opportunity for exchange of pathogens is increased among avian species, which make use of the same stopover sites. In such instances duration and concentration of the agent in the blood or the gastrointestinal tract of migrating birds are important for the subsequent infection of another competent vector that feeds or gets exposed in crowding situations or during stopover e.g. a tick. Several studies have recorded infections e.g. B. burgdorferi and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) in ticks removed from birds.36, 37, 87 Ticks commonly infest a wide range of avian species, especially, sparrows (Passeridae), thrushes and other ground foraging birds.30, 36, 37, 139, 140 Although a wide range of tick species has been reported to parasitize wild birds, Ixodes spp. are the most likely ones to carry infections (e.g. B. burgdorferi) especially in Europe and North America. Ixodid ticks often attach to hosts for 24\u201348 hours while acquiring a blood meal. In tick-borne viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, the infectious larval or nymphal tick may remain attached to the body of a migratory bird for several days and then deposited during migration in a new geographic area. During migration, there is sufficient time for some birds to travel hundreds or even a few thousand miles before ticks complete feeding and drop off. Even if these birds have small tick burdens, their large numbers could result in substantial contributions to local tick populations in coastal areas.40 There is even evidence of transhemispheric exchange of spirochete-infected ticks by seabirds indicating the capacity for wild birds to carry infected ticks for long distances.141 Moreover, birds can carry infections in their bloodstream which is introduced to local population of ticks at other sites. Therefore, birds play an important role not only in maintaining infections such as B. burgdorferi sensu lato in areas of endemicity, in addition some of them, through their migration, also play a role by spreading ticks within and between continents.36, 139, 142, 143\n",

Therefore, they are likely to drop engorged larvae in peridomestic environments like lawns and gardens,40 where ticks are less common than in woods and at wood edges but more likely to encounter people.38, 144 Even though the survival of nymphs is low in open habitats, the contribution of birds to human infection in the peridomestic environment could be substantial and deserves further study.40\n",

This is because migration routes are determined by complex interactions of environmental factors such as direction of prevailing winds, weather patterns, location of available food resources and geographical barriers (e.g. large bodies of water, deserts and mountains). These factors seldom combine to favour the same route in different seasons.3 Seasonality is a significant factor influencing both, wild birds (wild resident and migratory species) and other vectors e.g. mosquitoes, ticks leading to changes in transmission dynamics.149, 150, 151 For mosquitoes, a spring population peak in Europe and North America occurs during the spring migration of birds.146, 147, 148 The effect of seasonality in the flyway patterns of major migratory birds was observed for certain diseases such as West Nile virus encephalitis. The incidence of West Nile virus disease is seasonal in the temperate zones of North America, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin, with peak activity from July through October.152 Both avian and human infection rates drop to near zero as winter approaches and mosquitoes become dormant.153 Season is important for some non-vector-borne pathogens, as well. For example, influenza A viruses remain infectious in water at lower ambient temperatures and at the same time major congregations of migratory waterfowl occur, increasing the likelihood of transmission among birds. Furthermore, numerous bird species (e.g. crows and gulls) are attracted to untreated sewage, garbage dumps, manure, and other sources of enteric pathogens that can then be transmitted to humans. These areas should be appropriately covered and not open to the access of wild migratory birds.",

In support of this argument we did not find any evidence for direct transmission from wild and migratory birds to humans for any of the identified pathogens the only exception being the cluster of H5N1 human cases in Azerbaijan.16 In addition, in many cases, there was no further available information that would allow further elucidation of the real epidemiological role played by wild birds in the ecology of the considered infections, especially in underdeveloped countries. Many reports do not exactly clarify how the birds are implicated in the transmission of these infections and in the majority of cases this transmission could not be established by adequate scientific methods. Thus, in many of the reports reviewed herein, there were no data regarding serologic assays or molecular diagnostic techniques used to detect and characterize pathogens and identify birds as vectors of disease. In these cases only associations of these infections with migratory birds could be made (Table 2).",

In the literature, a different terminology is used to describe the interaction between hosts, including wild birds, and pathogens. Terms such as multihost pathogens, reservoir hosts, and spill-overs are frequently used, but often such different terms are used to describe the same phenomenon. There is a need for a single, standardised comprehensive framework that characterizes disease outcomes based on biologically meaningful processes. An example of such conceptual framework is based on the pathogen's between- and within-species transmission rates and can be used to describe possible configurations of a multihost\u2013pathogen community.159 In particular, the much-overused terms reservoir and spill-over can be seen to have explicit definitions, depending on whether the pathogen can be sustained within the target host population.159 However, the paucity of available published data did not allow us to determine whether the involved species of certain wild birds serve as reservoir or spill-over. Finally, only few studies have reviewed the role of migratory birds in transmission of all different infections and these studies remain descriptive.112\n",

Studying large wetland areas, and by extension, intact wetland bird communities, may represent a valuable ecosystem-based approach for controlling infections caused by migratory birds including WNV.161 Recent evaluations suggesting links between high biodiversity among wild birds and reduced vector-borne disease risk, such as WNV, may lead to a better understanding of distribution patterns of such diseases.48 Recent findings on the origin of the WNV infections suggest a single species to act as a super spreader and the transmission of WNV appears in new light.162 These recent findings demonstrate imposingly how important detailed studies on contact rates between vectors and host species are and how careful interpretations need to be made before drawing any conclusions. Estimation of the infection rate of wild bird populations with human pathogens or with other vectors carrying pathogens is clearly an indicated future challenge required to judge the possibilities of bird to human transmission of pathogens. The same accounts for the transmission between and within bird species. Recent investigations indicate the influence of social and sexual behaviours and their seasonal components on intra-specific transmission,163, 164 while the inter-specific transmission rate remains speculative. Birds are considered to show behavioural changes due to pathogen infection, which will considerably influence transmission rates.163 Furthermore, accurate data on the speed and direction of migratory birds may enable us to predict the timing of bird migration in more detail; this will assist in monitoring the risk of infections that may be caused by wild birds. While this knowledge is available for larger bird species due to the use of satellite tracking, only limited data are available on the individual level for some North American songbirds with the use of radio-telemetry tracking.165 Producing maps depicting the ecology of the vectors including mosquitoes and ticks ecology in combination with maps of migratory routes of wild birds along with access to real time climatic data could be the key for developing a real time early warning system for forecasting vector-borne disease outbreaks.166\n",

However, to effectively and completely cover the area of infections associated with wild birds would require involvement of both physicians and veterinarians especially those dealing with avian species.168 Unfortunately, one recent study demonstrated that communication between physicians and veterinarians about zoonotic diseases is largely absent.168 Therefore, one important factor that could potentially explain the paucity of available data regarding the transmission of pathogens from wild birds to humans could be the lack of communication between physicians and ornithologists. To most effectively decrease the risk of infections associated with wild birds, the public health and animal health sectors must collaborate in developing strategies to decrease human exposure to pathogens carried by wild birds.",

Although we could not fully define this role and it appears that further research is necessary, several conclusions can be made. First, there is no real evidence for direct wild bird\u2013human transmission besides rare examples occurring under exceptional circumstances. Several human infections can theoretically be transmitted from wild and migratory birds although the scientific base for most of the associations remains speculative. These findings are expected for zoonoses, which usually require the amplification in an animal species cycle before spill-over to humans. Wild and migrant birds are most important in seeding pathogens into these amplification systems. This explains why most of the association with transmission from bird to human may only occur indirectly. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for the dispersal of pathogens to new geographical locations by migrating birds but it is largely unknown how this will affect transmission to humans. The recent emergence of infections like West Nile virus and influenza A in various parts of the world is a prominent example of how rapidly and widely a migratory bird associated disease can spread. The potential factors and mechanisms involved in the transmission of such infectious agents from birds to humans need further elucidation. An in-depth comprehension of avian migration routes as well as further research using advanced molecular testing of the prevalence, pathogenesis, and clinical associations of several pathogens that are transmitted to humans from the various migratory bird species would lead to a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of diseases carried by avian species helping to predict future outbreaks of relevant human infections.",
