The use of an enzyme-linked conjugate as well as substrate leads to changes in color which help to determine the presence and the quantity of substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, and hormones in a given sample, such as blood or urine samples [1]. The importance of validated ELISA is evident especially when dealing with pathogens requiring high containment facilities such as MERS-CoV as it could provide a rapid, simple, and cheap method for field or clinical use without the need for high containment laboratories.",

Adjust the pH to 9.6 with HCl if needed and complete the volume to 1 L with water.Measure 100 mL of 1\u00d7 PBST to a 100 mL graduated cylinder and transfer the volume to a glass bottle. Transfer 5 g skim milk powder into the bottle and stir until dissolved.Coating buffer helps to bind antigen to the wells. During coating, sealing the plates will help prevent any reagents from evaporating overnight when leaving them in the refrigerator.Washing the 96-well ELISA plate with PBST will help remove any unbound antigens from the wells.Blocking helps in preventing nonspecific binding of detection antibodies to the microplate surface, reducing signal background and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Blocking could be done at 4 \u00b0C for overnight.Use heat-inactivated serum samples at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min.Mix thawed serum samples before and after dilution with a vortex for about 10 s.No primary antibody control could be included by adding 100 \u03bcL of blocking buffer per well.This washing step will help removing nonspecific or unbound antibodies.This washing step is critical to reduce background signal.Warm TMB substrate and stop solution to room temperature before use. Never pipette directly from the bottle. Pour out needed amount into a plastic reservoir. Do not return excess to the primary container.Avoid shaking.Stopped reactions should be read within 30 min. TMB BlueSTOP allows the chromophore to remain blue, instead of turning yellow. If using a stop solution resulting in a yellow reaction, read the plate at 450 nm.Samples with absorbance values that fall 0.26 and 0.34 should be considered \u201cindeterminate\u201d and should be validated with other methods if possible.Do steps 2\u20137 during incubation with blocking buffer.Change pipette tips between wells.Higher dilutions of the samples may be required in case the last dilution did not reach a signal equivalent to the background.\n",
