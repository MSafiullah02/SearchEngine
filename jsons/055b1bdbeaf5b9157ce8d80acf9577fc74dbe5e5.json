            "text": "There are several problems of mathematical physics in which the only available analytic solution is a divergent and/or truncated power series expansion. Over the past decade, a new approach has evolved to overcome the convergence barrier in series solutions. An asymptotic approximant is a closed-form expression whose expansion in one region is exact up to a specified order and whose asymptotic equivalence in another region is enforced. The remarkable feature of asymptotic approximants is their ability to attain uniform accuracy not only in these two regions, but also at all points in-between, as demonstrated thus far for problems in thermodynamics, astrophysics, and fluid dynamics [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The current need to model and predict viral epidemics motivates us to extend the application of asymptotic approximants to the commonly used Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. This model is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Although no exact analytic solution has yet been found for the SIR model, a convergent series solution may be formulated via the homotopy analysis method [8] . Here, we provide an alternative and simple analytic approach. Interestingly, the SIR model shares the same asymptotic features as boundary layer flow over a moving flat plate, for which asymptotic approximants have already been applied [4] . The analytic nature of the asymptotic approximant derived in what follows is advantageous. Model parameters may be extracted for available COVID-19 data via a least squares (or equivalent) technique without the need for an embedded numerical scheme. The SIR epidemic model considers the time-evolution of a susceptible population, S(t), interacting with an infected population, * Corresponding author.",

The expansion of ln S is obtained by first applying Cauchy's product rule to the identity SS \u22121 = 1 and evaluating like-terms to obtain a recursive expression for the coefficients of the expansion of S \u22121 , given by (6d). The expansion of S \u22121 is subsequently integrated term-by-term to obtain the expansion of ln S, whose coefficients are given by (6c). Although the series solution given by (6) is an analytic solution to (5) , it is only valid within its radius of convergence and is incapable of capturing the long-time behavior of S. This motivates the construction of an approximant to analytically continue the series beyond this convergence barrier. The long-time asymptotic behavior of the system (5) is required to develop our asymptotic approximant, and so we proceed as follows. It has been proven in prior literature [11] that S approaches a limiting value, S \u221e , as t \u2192 \u221e, and this corresponds to I \u2192 0 according to (5) . The value of S \u221e satisfies Eq. (4) with I = 0 as [11] \u03b1 r ln",

It is natural, then, to apply the Sakiadis approximant [4] to capture this asymptotic behavior while retaining the t = 0 behavior given by (6a). The Sakiadis approximant imposes the exponential form of the longtime asymptotic behavior (11) for all time; the coefficients of the exponentials are determined by matching their short-time expansion to the known power series developed about t = 0 in the form of (6a).

The convergence of the approximant with increasing N is a necessary condition for a valid approximant. For the problems of mathematical physics to which we have applied asymptotic approximants [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , we have observed that convergence of approximants implies excellent agreement with numerical results. There is as-of-yet no proof developed that guarantees this result, but this interesting behavior has been a property of all approximants developed thus far. In Fig. 1b, the converged (N = 15) asymptotic approximant for S is used to obtain R and I (from Eqs. (2) and (4), respectively) and is compared with the numerical solution for these quantities.",

            "text": "Note that the reported COVID-19 outbreak data [13] in Fig. 3 is originally provided in terms of confirmed cases and recovered individuals per day. The difference between these two quantities is used as an approximation to compare with the quantity I of the SIR model. It is acknowledged that the actual COVID-19 data is influenced by transient effects not included in the SIR model such as the exposure lag-time; these effects are incorporated in more sophisticated models such as SEIR [11] . The approximation of I from COVID-19 data is not restrictive in the current context, as our purpose is to show the efficacy of the closed form approximant rather than assess the validity of the SIR model. In Fig. 3 , a least squares fit of the asymptotic approximant to I data is used to extract SIR parameters \u03b1 and r based on data from the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. To do so, (4) is used to relate I analytically to the solution for S (here, the approximant S A,30 ); note that S \u221e , used in the approximant, is affected by these parameters explicitly according to (7) . The value of S 0 is not provided in the data set [13] , and a least-squares algorithm is ineffective at determining an optimal value. Here, we choose the value of S 0 to be twice that of the maximum value of I approximated from the data, as it captures a typical curve shape for S seen in applications of the SIR model [11] . In regards to the sensitivity of fitting parameters to the choice for S 0 , a 100% difference in S 0 leads to roughly a 50% difference in r and a 6% difference in \u03b1. The fit is made especially simple owing to the analytical form of the approximant that obviates the need to embed the numerical solution in such an algorithm. The population of recovered individuals, R, is extracted from the solution for I by direct integration in accordance with (2) . Note that the predicted curve for R in Fig. 3 , obtained solely by fitting data for I, is in good agreement with approximations from COVID-19 data for the recovered population, and serves as a check on the consistency of the data and algorithm. It is evident from the results presented here that an asymptotic approximant can be used to provide accurate analytic solutions to the SIR model. Future work should focus on whether the asymptotic approximant technique can yield a closed form solution to more sophisticated epidemic models.",
