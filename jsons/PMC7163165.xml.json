During the early phase of rehabilitation after his SCI he required a tracheostomy and was mechanically ventilated, but after weaning off mechanical ventilation, the tracheostomy tube was removed. He has a neurogenic bowel managed with permanent colostomy and neurogenic bladder managed with a suprapubic catheter and low-dose oxybutynin (5 mg daily). Current medications include rivaroxaban 20 mg daily since 2014 due to recurrent deep vein thrombosis, gabapentin (400 mg twice a day) and tramadol (15 mg twice a day), both for neuropathic pain. He underwent plastic surgery in 2016 for reparation of a sacral pressure ulcer. In 2019 he was hospitalized three times for severe urinary tract infections, all sustained by gram negative bacteria. On his last hospital admission, in December 2019, he tested positive for colonization by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae on a rectal swab test.",
