            "text": "Kidney disease, both acute and chronic, can present unique challenges with respect to respiratory physiology, lung\u2013kidney interaction, and mechanical ventilation support [3]. First, CKD/ESRD patients often have high prevalence of comorbid respiratory illness such as restrictive or obstructive defects, pleural disease, pulmonary calcification, sleep apnea, or dialysis-associated hypoxemia. Patients receiving PD have chronically elevated intra-abdominal pressure and diminished functional residual capacity. These factors predispose to limited pulmonary reserve. Second, CKD/ESRD patients often have diminished cardiac reserve and all have compromised capacity to excrete solute and water. Acute cardiac events and/or fluid accumulation (i.e., noncompliance with diet, inappropriate dry weight prescription, missed dialysis) can predispose to acute cardiorenal syndrome and pulmonary edema. Third, the development of acute injury to the kidney can induce a systemic inflammatory response with distant pathophysiologic effects in the lung (i.e., alterations in alveolar permeability and aquaporin expression). Fourth, the positive pressure applied during mechanical ventilation acts to increase intrathoracic, intrapleural, and intra-abdominal pressures both during inspiration and for the duration of the respiratory cycle (i.e., PEEP) with the aim to improve and maintain adequate gas exchange. This can stimulate an array of hemodynamic, neural, and hormonal responses that can negatively impact kidney perfusion and further inhibit excretory function. This is observed as immediate and reversible declines in urine output and fluid retention, contributing to worsening fluid accumulation. Finally, mechanical ventilation may provoke ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) leading to an exacerbating cascade of systemic inflammation that may have distant injurious effects on the kidney [3]. Data have also shown the development of AKI may delay weaning from mechanical ventilation [4]. This is likely multifactorial and related to greater difficulties with volume and acid\u2013base homeostasis in AKI. By extension, CKD/ESRD patients are similarly likely to encounter prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation.",

The incidence of milder forms of ARDS is 78.9/100,000 person-years while more severe ARDS occurs at a rate of 58.7/100,000 person-years. The most common predisposing factor is pulmonary and non-pulmonary sepsis. The mortality remains significant, in the range of 35\u201340 %, and long-term morbidity among survivors remains severely burdensome. The development of AKI or worsening kidney function in the setting of ARDS is common, occurring in excess of 35 %, and has an important modifying impact on increasing mortality risk (60\u201380 %) [4]. It is believed part of the attributable mortality in ARDS has been related to the development of secondary harm associated with the mechanical ventilator (i.e., VILI). Accordingly, a number of \u201clung protective\u201d strategies for improving outcome in ARDS have been evaluated (Table 32.4). The advent of open lung low tidal volume ventilation to prevent alveolar overdistension, cyclic collapse, and barotrauma may be associated with iatrogenic alveolar hypoventilation and hypercarbic respiratory acidosis. This may be poorly tolerated in patients with AKI or CKD/ESRD with loss of renal compensation and inability to buffer the accumulated CO2. These patients are likely to require early initiation of RRT to mitigate severe acidemia and excessive fluid accumulation.\n",

Bicarbonate is commonly used in critical illness when confronted by severe metabolic acidosis (i.e., pH <7.15); however, its use is guided by limited clinical evidence. Bicarbonate supplementation intended to treat loss of bicarbonate from the buffer pool (i.e., renal tubular acidosis) would appear logical; however, its use to treat acidosis due to elevated lactate has been associated with increased mortality. Bicarbonate administration (1\u20132 mEq/kg) can transiently increase serum pH and serum bicarbonate; however, it may precipitate untoward adverse effects including worsening intracellular acidosis, extracellular accumulation of CO2, and hypocalcemia. The current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines do not recommend use of bicarbonate for serum pH >7.15 in patients with lactic acidosis associated with severe sepsis. When bicarbonate is administered, consideration should be given for a slow infusion, allowance for adequate CO2 removal, and correction of hypocalcemia along with reversal of the underlying contributing factor for the acidosis.",

It is likely more important to evaluate the broad clinical context of critically ill patients\u2019 admission diagnosis, illness severity, non-kidney organ dysfunction, the probability of worsening AKI or non-recovery, and additional conditions that may be modified by RRT (i.e., fluid accumulation) rather than reliance on absolute thresholds in conventional biochemical markers such as creatinine or urea. Early initiation of RRT in patients with AKI or advanced CKD has the intuitive appeal of avoiding life-threatening AKI complications while ensuring the adequate delivery of essential medications (i.e., antimicrobials) and nutrition and transfusion support without concern for excessive fluid accumulation. Recent systematic reviews have supported this concept, suggesting earlier RRT initiation may improve survival; however, studies included in these analyses were highly susceptible to bias [17, 18].\n",

Systematic reviews have not shown a clear survival advantage for one modality, continuous RRT (CRRT), slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), or intermittent RRT (IRRT), over another in critically ill patients with AKI [19] (Table 32.9). Ideally, the modality chosen should suit the patient\u2019s acute physiology and therapeutic objectives while avoiding treatment-related complications. CRRT is the preferred modality in hemodynamically unstable patients and those with acute brain injury or fulminant hepatic failure and at risk for intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema [11]. CRRT has also been shown superior for maintaining fluid homeostasis and mitigating fluid overload. A recent systematic review suggested that initial therapy with CRRT in critically ill patients is associated with lower rates of dialysis dependence among survivors when compared with IRRT [20]. These data may imply CRRT may be the preferred initial modality for surviving critically ill patients at increased risk for incident or worsening CKD (i.e., those with baseline CKD).\n",

Two multicenter randomized trials, the Department of Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health (VA/NIH) Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) Study and the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study, found no incremental benefit in critically ill patients with AKI from a more intensive (high-dose) RRT compared with a less intensive RRT strategy [22, 23]. The more intensive strategy did not decrease mortality, accelerate recovery of kidney function, or alter the rate of nonrenal organ failure. Importantly, these findings do not imply that the dose of RRT is not important, but rather, the evidence would suggest there is no need to exceed a CRRT dose of 20\u201325 mL/kg/h effluent flow rate or IHD three times per week with delivered Kt/Vurea 1.2\u20131.4 per treatment for small solute clearance.",

First, the literature should be reviewed for existing data on drug dose guidance for a specific drug [25]. Second, for drugs with primary renal elimination, a bedside estimate of baseline GFR and a dynamic assessment of total creatinine clearance, if applicable, should be undertaken, assuming there is no significant secretion or reabsorption. In particular, consideration should be given to patients receiving RRT who have recovering or residual renal function. Third, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and risk of toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring when possible should be undertaken (i.e., phenytoin, vancomycin, aminoglycosides). Fourth, several drug classes may be administered based on their observed clinical response, such as with sedatives, analgesics, or vasoactive medications. However, selected drugs have potentially toxic metabolites that can accumulate in patients with reduced kidney function. As examples, the elimination of \u03b11-hydroxymidazolam (main metabolite of midazolam) and glucuronide metabolites of morphine are principally eliminated by the kidneys and thus may accumulate in AKI/CKD. Finally, given the complexity, there is a recognized need for a dedicated ICU pharmacist among the interdisciplinary ICU team, particularly for patients with CKD or AKI.",
