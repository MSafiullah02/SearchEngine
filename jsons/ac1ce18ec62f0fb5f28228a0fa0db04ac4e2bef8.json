The syndrome of functional liver failure covers a wide spectrum of clinical, biochemical and neurophysiological changes.

It is characterized by a deterioration in the synthesizing, regulatory and detoxifying function of the liver. This final stage of liver disease terminates in hepatic coma.",

Acute liver failure can be seen as identical to the \"acute yellow atrophy\" described by K. Rokitansky in 1842. This acute and severe clinical picture was subsequently termed \"bilious dyscrasia\" (P. J. Horaczek, 1844), \"icterus gravis\" (C. Ozanam, 1849), \"acholia\" (F. Th.

Quincke, 1899) and \"hepatic coma\" were used to denote the final stage, which usually sets in at the end of acute or chronic liver failure. \u2022 Acute liver failure in the course of acute viral hepatitis was termed \"fulminant hepatitis\" by W.

There is usually still a response to acoustic stimuli. The EEG shows a slowing down of basic activity (0.5\u03ea3.0/ sec.) together with mainly biphasic and triphasic potentials. Lethality rises to over 50%. In stage IV, the patient is in a deep coma. There is evidence of areflexia, an absence of any corneal reflex and loss of tonicity; the brain waves flatten out to an isoelectric line. Irrespective of therapy, lethality is 80\u03ea90%. (s. tab. 15.5) Cerebral oedema: As from coma stage III, cerebral pressure can increase (75\u03ea80% of cases) owing to water retention and/or vasodilation with hyperaemia, yet with a subsequent reduction in cerebral perfusion and hypoxia. Intracranial cerebral compression is > 20 mm Hg. Cerebral oedema is vasogenetic and/or cytotoxic, the latter feature appearing to predominate. Clinical symptoms include disorders in the respiratory rhythm (in particular tachypnoea), hypertension and bradycardia as well as increased muscular tonus. Singultus suggests damage to and impending constriction of the brain stem. The pupils are dilated due to the pressure on the oculomotor nerve. Occasionally, chemosis develops, which is a fatal prognostic sign. (2) Intracranial blood circulation sinks rapidly. In 30\u03ea60% of cases, cerebral oedema is fatal. (10, 11, 38, 62, 64, 74, 76) Jaundice: With the foudroyant disintegration of liver cells, a comatose condition can set in within a few hours, even before jaundice is identified. In most cases, however, jaundice is already present. The intensity and time of onset vary. Severe jaundice (> 20 mg/dl) is considered to be a poor prognostic sign.",

Despite this hyperventilation, there is evidence of hypoxia, which is largely due to a disorder in oxygen diffusion. The causes for this are microthromboses, interstitial formation of oedema and increased peripheral vasotonia. Central biochemical mechanisms together with an inadequate cerebral blood circulation as a result of a reduction in pCO 2 reinforce the respiratory insufficiency.

Prostaglandin: The positive results achieved by the application of PGE 1 were reported in 1987 (M. Abacassis et al.). According to a subsequent prospective study, 71% of patients with fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis survived. (55, 61) The effect is attributed to improved arterial flow and regeneration of the liver (0.1 to 0.6 \u00b5g/ kg BW/hr by means of perfusor for up to 18 hours, with the dosage gradually being phased out). \u2022 Beware of hypotension! Glucocorticoids were first administered with some success in acute liver failure by H. Ducci et al. in 1952.

The application of glucocorticoids in autoimmune hepatitis with acute liver failure did not prove successful.

However, based on the results of subsequent studies (G. Baltzer et al., 1971; A. G. Redeker et al., 1973), this procedure can no longer be recommended. 2. Haemoperfusion: The removal of both water-soluble and protein-bound substances from the plasma was first attempted by means of a haemoperfusion circuit, using a column filled with activated charcoal (D. C. Schechter et al., 1958; H. Yatzidis et al., 1964). Both the unwanted binding of corpuscular components and the danger of embolization from charcoal particles could largely be eliminated by coating the activated charcoal with a biocompatible membrane, i.e. microencapsulation (T. M. S. Chang et al., 1964). Because of the greater aggregation of thrombocytes, however, thrombopenia often ensues. This event can generally be prevented by the administration of prostacyclin (C. A. E. Gimson et al., 1980). Unfortunately, however, this procedure causes a loss of insulin and other hormones. (88) 3. Cross-circulation: Homologous cross-circulation with healthy volunteers was first attempted by J. M. Burnell et al. in 1965. \u2022 Due to multiple problems, S. C. W. Bosman et al. introduced heterologous cross-circulation using a baboon in 1968; baboons are the only animal species which can tolerate human blood for 5 to 7 days. 4. Plasmapheresis: This procedure is a further development of blood exchange (M. J. Leporeet al., 1967). The patient's plasma is separated by centrifugation or other appropriate techniques and discarded, so that the protein-bound and fat-soluble toxins circulating in the plasma are removed. This plasma volume is replaced by fresh plasma. At the same time, the separated corpuscular components of the patient's blood are reinfused. Serious complications may arise from the transmission of viral hepatitis and the occurrence of transfusion-related lung disorders (ARDS). Nevertheless, the method involved is simple and has been carried out successfully in individual cases(87,91) even as plasma exchange with the administration of a high plasma volume (1.3 l/hr over 8 hours). \u2022 It has proved to be much more successful when the serum (ca. 3 l fresh frozen plasma/day) is infused into the femoral artery rather than into the vein(G. Brunner et al., 1991).",

The circulatory system is washed out with electrolyte solutions and then refilled with donor blood whilst the patient is in a state of hypothermia (G. Klebanoff et al., 1972). 7. Haemodialysis: In 1968 temporary improvement could be achieved for the first time by means of haemodialysis in a patient presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (W. M. Keynes); this was repeated later in 1977 (R. Oules et al.). The procedure, however, is not generally recommended. It may be indicated in renal failure, acid-base disorders or with hyperhydration. Following haemodialysis, substitution of reduced amino acids is necessary. 8. Haemofiltration: This procedure turned out to be of more value than haemodialysis. No dialysate fluid is required. Instead, a solution containing buffered bicarbonate is used to replace the ultrafiltrate. In fulminant hepatic failure, continuous venovenous haemofiltration is recommended because of its advantages for the circulation and metabolism. Heparin or prostacyclin can be used as anticoagulants (C. A. E. Gimson et al., 1980). 9. Haemodiabsorption: The BiologicDT system is a combination of haemodialysis and haemoadsorption (S. R. Ash et al. 1992). (82) Plasma separation was subsequently added to this system (S. R. Ash et al., 1998). (83) This newly developed BiologicDTPF facilitates direct plasma contact with the haemodiadsorber. The system, which makes use of both a charcoal and a cation exchanger, dialyzes blood across a parallel plate dialyzer with a cellulose membrane. So far, results have been disappointing \u03ea only lactate, creatinine and bilirubin were reduced. 10. Albumin dialysis: The aim of albumin dialysis is to remove both soluble metabolites and albumin-bound substances (ABS) from the blood of patients with acute liver failure. (s. tab. 20.",
