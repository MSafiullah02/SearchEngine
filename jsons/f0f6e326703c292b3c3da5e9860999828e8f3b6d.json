To date, there are no licensed prophylactics or therapeutics available to prevent or treat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or Coronavirus disease 2019 , the diseases caused by infection with SARS-CoV, respectively. Tracking the origins of these novel coronaviruses has important implications for the control and prevention of related infectious diseases in humans. While the scientific world is focused on developing efficacious drugs, vaccines and therapeutics specific to HCoV-19 to save the maximum number of lives, elucidating the source of these viruses can lead to evidence-based policy changes that can prevent infections, and thus outbreaks, from occurring in the first place. Extensive work performed on the origins of SARS-CoV found that this virus had zoonotic origins (de Wit et al., 2016; Guan et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2005) . In particular, samples taken from apparently healthy palm civets (Paguma spp.) sold as food in local wet markets in Guangdong Province, China, during the SARS epidemic resulted in the detection and isolation of a SARS-CoV strain (SARS-CoV strain (Guan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005) . Combined with molecular studies showing that the SARS-CoV receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2) between humans and palm civets were sufficiently similar to allow for virus entry and presumptively infection, it was deduced that SARS-CoV may have crossed the species barrier from palm civets to humans (Li et al., 2005b; Peiris et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV was later detected in raccoon dogs (Nyctereuteus sp.), ferret badgers (Melogale sp.) and domestic cats (Guan et al., 2003; Martina et al., 2003) . In 2005, a number of SARS-like coronaviruses were discovered in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) Li et al., 2005a; Poon et al., 2005) . Phylogenetic analysis of these SARS-like coronaviruses strongly suggested bat-origins for these pathogens, and horseshoe bats (as the presumptive natural reservoir) likely infected humans directly in the wild or indirectly through intermediate animal species (such as palm civets) in Chinese live animal markets Li et al., 2005a; Poon et al., 2005; Shi & Hu, 2008; Wang et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The investigative work performed on the origins of MERS-CoV also suggests that bats are likely the natural reservoirs of this pathogen (Ithete et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013) . Studies have shown the detection of sequences phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV in bats (Nycteris sp.) in Ghana and Europe (Pipistrellus sp.) (Annan et al., 2013) . In addition, camels were also implicated in the interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV to humans (Hemida et al., 2014) . Multiple studies have shown that there is high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV specific antibodies in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Egypt, Oman and other locations in the Middle East, but that sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids were seronegative (Omrani et al., 2015) . Epidemiological work also showed that a majority of confirmed MERS patients had close contact history with dromedary camels, or products derived from these animals, such as camel meat and milk (Hemida et al., 2017) . In addition, the MERS-CoV sequences isolated from patients and closecontact dromedary camels were highly similar, or in some cases, 100% identical (Azhar et al., 2014) . Thus, the evidence supports that while camels serve as the principal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans, bats may be again the natural reservoir of this pathogen. Additionally, some alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in the endemic region were also seropositive for MERS-CoV, suggesting this animal may be another source for MERS-CoVs (Reusken et al., 2016) . Based on the available evidence, it seems that the animal-to-human transmissions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are clear, and sets a good paradigm for tracing the origins of HCoV-19.",

There are several websites and servers, such as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR: https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/), showing the genomic epidemiology and clustering of HCoV-19 genomes in the human population, and the information there helped scientists to understand mutations in HCoV-19, designing proper diagnostic kits, and tracing ongoing outbreaks across the world. Based on a distorted elucidation and/or improper analysis of the initially released, limited numbers of HCoV-19 genome data, there are several speculations or conspiracy theories that HCoV-19 was artificially generated in the laboratory (Andersen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) , especially the insertion of a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site in the spike protein, which was found for the first time in beta-coronaviruses (Andersen et al., 2020) . Based on the information and knowledge gained from past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, combined with the successful detection and isolation of SARS-like coronaviruses (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) in bats (R. affinis) with over 95% similarity to HCoV-19, it can be postulated with a degree of confidence that this novel coronavirus likely also originated from bats (Zhou et al., 2020a) . In addition, the insertion of \"PAA\" on the cleavage site between S1 and S2 has now been found in a coronavirus genome identified in another bat (R. malaynus) . These results further indicate at least two bat species, R. affinis and R. malaynus, may be the putative natural hosts of HCoV-19, and confirmed that bats are likely the animal reservoir for the SARS-like (Shi & Hu, 2008; Wang et al., 2006) and HCoV-19-like coronaviruses. So far, there is no conclusive evidence showing that bats can directly transmit the HCoV-19-like coronaviruses to humans.",

In one study, Lam et al. (2020) performed metagenomic sequencing of lung, intestine and blood samples from the Malayan pangolins and identified viral sequences that belong to two sub-lineages of HCoV-19 related coronaviruses. In particular, five critical residues on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the pangolin virus, playing important roles for human receptor binding, are identical to HCoV-19 . Re-analysis of a previously reported viral metagenomics dataset of Malayan pangolins (Liu et al., 2019) also suggested a probable pangolin origin of HCoV-19 . The isolation and comprehensive characterization of a HCoV-19 related coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) in the pangolins has further implicated the Malayan pangolin as a possible intermediate host for HCoV-19 (Xiao et al., 2020) , and HCoV-19 might have originated from possible recombination between the reported Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus (Zhou et al., 2020a) and this Pangolin-CoV-like virus (Xiao et al., 2020) . Malayan pangolins are found in nature throughout Southeast Asia (including Laos PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia), but not known to be native in China, where HCoV-19 was first reported Lu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2020) . Due to its importance as a food source and a traditional Chinese medicine, Malayan pangolins are illegally smuggled in live from Southeast Asia to China to be sold in live animal markets or as dried scales to be sold in Chinese Medicine store. Furthermore, R. affinis and R. malaynus, as suspected natural reservoir of HCoV-19 (Zhou et al., 2020a , are also distributed widely in South and Southeast Asia. It remains to be seen whether bats and Malayan pangolins (or any other unknown animal species at the moment) played a role in the generation of HCoV-19 via recombination ( Figure 1A ). Most recently, Andersen et al. (2020) put forward several theories regarding the origins of the HCoV-19 and highlighted the potential role of natural selection in animal host before the zoonotic transfer, natural selection in humans after the animalto-human transfer, and adaptation during sequential passages. The theories will help uncover the origins of HCoV-19, but direct scientific evidence is needed.",

However, whether there exist any other animal species that may also play an intermediate role in the interspecies spread of HCoV-19 remains unknown. The recent report for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing serum antibodies in cats from Wuhan, Hubei Province, indicated that cats were infected during the COVID-19 outbreak . Direct inoculation of HCoV-19 to a variety of animals showed that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to this virus, whereas dogs have a low genetic susceptibility, and pigs, chickens and ducks could not be infected . In particular, cats could transmit the virus via respiratory droplets , which would pose difficulties for the control of the virus. Other studies showed that Syrian hamsters (Chan et al., 2020) and monkeys (Bao et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b; Munster et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Shan et al., 2020) are susceptible to HCoV-19 infection and may be promising as potential animal models for COVID-19, indicating a possibility of interspecies spread of HCoV-19 ( Figure 1A) . Anecdotal reports in a variety of news media reported that tigers in a New York Zoo tested positive for HCoV-19, in which these animals exhibited symptoms of the illness (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/04/tigercoronavirus-covid19-positive-test-bronx-zoo/). These reports suggested that there may be more animals susceptible to HCoV-19 than previously thought ( Figure 1A) .",

There is a need to prioritize sampling of animals that may carry SARS-like or HCoV-19-like coronaviruses in this region. Regular and routine investigations into wet markets selling wild exotic animals for consumption is urgently needed, as these animals are often kept in crowded, unsanitary conditions with other species, which may promote viral reassortment and interspecies transmission.

Characterizing the interaction between spike (S) protein and ACE2 of different species ( Figure 1B ) would give clues for the origins/intermediate and susceptible hosts, as well as for drug and vaccine development (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) .

Given the importance of ACE2 and other unknown co-receptor(s) in the infection process, it is also crucial to analyze the expression patterns and levels of ACE2 and other co-receptor(s) in mediating the HCoV-19 infection, and by extension, determining the mediating host animals.

            "text": "In short, accumulating evidence on the discovery of SARS-, MERS-and HCoV-19-like viruses in animals makes it clear that there are likely more unknown, highly virulent coronaviruses with epidemic/pandemic potential circulating amongst wild animal species. Increased interactions between human populations and these zoonotic hosts due to deforestation, economical development and climate change will increase the probability for close contact, and thus higher chances for the next outbreak. In light of this scenario, it is ever more important for authorities to provide sustainable support not only for the discovery of novel coronaviruses, but also other unknown or neglected tropical pathogens with potential for high public health impact, such as bunyaviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses and so on. As evidenced by the increasing frequency of viral epidemics/pandemics with novel pathogens in the 21 st century (i.e., SARS-CoV, pandemic H1N1, MERS-CoV, Zika virus and now HCoV-19), it remains difficult to predict the location and timing of the next outbreak. Pathogen surveillance and discovery, facilitated by cuttingedge new sequencing technology, comparative genomic analyses and elegant molecular characterization, remains one of our best ways for pandemic preparedness, and the origins of novel pathogens, along with specific vaccine and drug development, need to be highlighted as research priorities, such that evidence-based policy for the prevention of future infections with novel pathogens can be established.ished.",
