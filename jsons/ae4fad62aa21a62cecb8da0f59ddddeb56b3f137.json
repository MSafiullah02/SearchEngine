The proposed model describes the evolution of a class of zoonotic infections where the pathogen is shared by m host species and transmitted by p arthropod vector species. In each host, the infectious period is structured into n stages with a corresponding infectiousness parameter to each vector species. We determine the basic reproduction number R 2 0 (m, n, p) and investigate the dynamics of the systems when this threshold is less or greater than one. We show that the dynamics of the multi-host, multi-stage, and multi-vector system is completely determined by the basic reproduction number and the structure of the host-vector network configuration. Particularly, we prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever R 2 0 (m, n, p) < 1, and a unique strongly endemic equilibrium exists and is GAS if R 2 0 (m, n, p) > 1 and the host-vector configuration is irreducible. That is, either the disease dies out or persists in all hosts and all vector species.",

That is, blood-sucking arthropod vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, fleas and sandflies play the role of connecting multiple hosts while potentially infecting them and getting infected during this process. Thus, formulating the dynamics of zoonoses requires understanding the ecology of all involved host species and their interactions with vector species that carry the pathogen between hosts. These complexities have made a comprehensive study of zoonoses very challenging, making mathematical models of zoonoses scarce and mainly focused on WNV [8] or directly transmitted zoonoses [2, 3, 28] . Recent research has been focused on understanding the dynamics and control of vector-borne zoonoses with one vector and two hosts (see [32, 36] for WNV, [11] for Chagas' disease, and [23, 31] for TBRF). Also, authors in [6] proposed a class of vector-borne zoonoses with an arbitrary number of hosts and one vector and provided the complete global dynamics of equilibria.",

For instance, over 65 different mosquito species transmit WNV to a number of hosts including humans, mammals and many species of birds [17, 24] . Another example of a highly complex zoonosis is the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Indeed, as illustrated in [10, 29] , the main vector of EEEV is the mosquito Culiseta melanura, which feeds exclusively on birds, and thus infects birds only. These birds infect, in turn, other mosquito species, which then bite humans, therefore creating a direct chain of transmission of the pathogen between a host and vector species with no direct link and/or transmissibility. Hence, as stated in [29] , the elimination or mitigation of zoonoses requires breaking the multiple transmission cycles corresponding to each potential host and vector species.",

Moreover, we structure each host's infectious stage into n different \"ages\" or classes where they infect each vector species at different rates. The proposed model provides a general framework in modeling zoonoses as it takes into account the complex patterns and multi-faceted host species dynamics along with their interactions with vector species. The derived class of models handles multiple levels of organizations including the case where some host or vector species have different epidemiological structures than others. Our modeling framework offers a plethora of possible scenarios and could be applied to study specific cases of zoonoses, and thus hopes to provide a forum that could help guide decisions on control efforts to mitigate and/or eradicate some zoonoses.",

Particularly, we derive conditions under which the disease dies out or persists in all host species and vector species. A key threshold quantity happens to be the basic reproduction number R 2 0 (m, n, p) for the general system with m host, n stages, and p vector species. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever R 2 0 (m, n, p) < 1. The proof of the uniqueness of an endemic equilibrium (EE) for large epidemic systems is known to be challenging. Indeed, the uniqueness of an EE may not hold for multi-group directly transmitted diseases [35, 21] and sexually transmitted diseases [19] . For our system, we will prove indeed that it has a unique strongly EE (in the sense of Thieme [39] ) under the assumption that the host-vector network configuration is irreducible and R 2 0 (m, n, p) > 1. To do so, we transformed the system at equilibrium into an auxiliary dynamical system and showed that the equilibrium of the newly crafted system, is globally attractive under the pre-cited hypotheses. Moreover, we will prove that the strongly EE is GAS whenever it exists. The latter relies on a carefully constructed Lyapunov function and elements of graph theory. The authors in [14, 15] first used tools of graph theory to study the GAS of the EE for multi-group models for directed transmitted diseases. To do so, they derived a Lyapunov function for the multi-group system from that of a single epidemic system. Also, in [33, 34] , the authors used these tools to investigate for stage-progression models for water-borne diseases and the authors in [20] successfully generalized the approach to a multi-group vector-borne SIR \u2212 SI system. For our model, the arbitrary number of host species, stages, and vector species (all potentially different) present specificities that make the approach employed the after-mentioned papers impractical. For instance, the construction of the Lyapunov function from that of one group does not apply in our case.",

The susceptible populations of host species i are generated through a constant recruitment \u039b i , subjected to a natural death rate of \u00b5 i and could be infected after being bitten by an infectious vector of any species j. After being infected, the susceptible populations of Host i become latent, who then become infectious after an incubation period of 1/\u03bd i . The infectiosity period of host species is structured into n stages, each characterizing the level of parasitemia in the corresponding host.

Model (2) describes the dynamics of a Multi-Host and Multi-Vector SEI n R \u2212 SI model where the infectious stage in each host is composed of n stages. The model is flexible and could be adapted to cases where different hosts could have different epidemiological structures with respect to the infection. This extends the work in [6, 23, 31] which consider the dynamics zoonoses and one vector species. Our model extend also the multi-host and multi-vector in [12] which explores and SIR-SI type of host-vector interaction. Particularly, our model consists of SEI n R where the infection of each host is stratified into n infectious classes and each of these classes infect susceptible vectors at different rates. This extension captures a more realistic aspect of infection in the interactions between hosts and vectors. Moreover, although we considered an SI structure for the vectors for simplicity, the results of this paper are also valid if the vector species's dynamics follows an SEI structure. Indeed, for some vectors such as mosquitoes, their incubation period is often nearly two weeks, which is on the same scale as their lifespan, making an SEI model more suited for their dynamics.",

To do so, we look at the coefficients of the sums from the graph-theoretical standpoint, following the same approach as [14, 15, 16, 20] . Indeed, let G(N ) be the directed graph that represents the connectivity N between the m hosts (including the l stages) and p vectors. Since the Host-Vector connectivity configuration N is irreducible, it follows that graph G(N ) is strongly connected. Recall that, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, v i are components of the solution of the systemBv = 0, whereB is given by (16) . The matrix B is the so-called Laplacian matrix and its associated the graph G(B) is strongly connected sinceB is irreducible, since N is. Moreover, the solution ofBv = 0 is given by the Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem [7, 30] as follows: where E(T ) is the set of all arcs in T . For our setup, an arc (i, l, i \u2032 , j) describes an infection arc that starts from Host i, at stage l directed to Host i \u2032 through Vector j. From a modeling standpoint, v i connects Host i to all vectors (through\u03b2 i l,j ) and connect all vectors to all hosts but i (through w kj , with k = i). By using Cayley's formula [1, 30] , each v i = C ii is the sum of n m\u22121 p m\u22121 m m\u22122 terms, each of which is the product of m \u2032 \u2212 1 w kj\u03b2 i l,j with k = i. These w kj\u03b2 i l,j represent the weight of each spanning tree T i , rooted at Host i.",

The proposed model improves those of [6, 23, 31] -by incorporating multiple arthropod vector species-and [11, 12] -by incorporating multiple hosts within multiple stages in each hosts' infectious class and the heterogeneous nature of the interactions between these host species and multiple arthropod vector species. We computed the basic reproduction number of the general system R 2 0 (m, n, p), for m hosts, n hosts' infectious stages and p vectors species. We proved that the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 2 0 (m, n, p) < 1 (Theorem 3.1). Under the assumption the host-vector network configuration is irreducible, we proved that there exists a unique \"strongly\" endemic equilibrium as long as R 2 0 (m, n, p) > 1 and that, it is GAS whenever it exists. This result is new and improves previous results of [6] , for which the global result for multiple hosts and one vector is given, and of [12] in which a case of multi-species, multi-vector is considered but no stability results were given.",

The uniqueness and the global stability of the strongly endemic equilibrium requires the irreducibility of the host-vector network (Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3), leading to the conclusion that the disease either dies out or persists in all hosts and all vectors. That is, controlling the disease requires an intervention in all hosts. This is close to impossible, given that some hosts are not even known. Furthermore, in some cases the natural habitats of some hosts and vectors are so apart that it is unlikely there is a direct transmission between these hosts and vector for an infection to take place. This could collapse the irreducibility of the hosts-vectors configuration. Thus, it is important to investigate the global asymptotic behavior of the solutions when the host-vector network configuration is reducible.
