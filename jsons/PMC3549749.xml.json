            "text": "Pulmonary diseases are important causes of morbidity in both adults and children [1,2]. The diverse pulmonary diseases go along with clinical challenges. In adults, lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when successful treatment is difficult [3]. Furthermore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are prevalent lung diseases that account for a major burden on society in terms of morbidity and health care costs. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of both diseases are important for proper treatment decisions, optimal disease control and prognosis. However, the available clinical tools are not always fulfilling. In young children, a reliable asthma diagnosis is difficult as there are no tools available to discriminate between true asthmatics and children with transient, virus-induced symptoms. On account of these clinical challenges, there is a continuous search for techniques that can improve accurate diagnoses and management decisions. A potential non-invasive technique is the analysis of volatile biomarkers in exhaled breath, so called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this manuscript we systematically review the current knowledge on VOCs regarding their potential clinical use in pulmonary diseases.",

            "text": "Asthma, COPD, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and lung cancer are characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress. Monitoring of airway inflammation and oxidative stress can be helpful in the diagnosis and monitoring of these diseases. Current available techniques to directly measure inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways are bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy. These techniques are too invasive for repeated routine use, especially in children. The need for non-invasive analysis of inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs has led to increasing interest in exhaled breath analysis (Figure 1). Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) is the most extensively studied marker in exhaled breath. Although the analysis of FeNO might be a helpful clinical tool in some pulmonary diseases, it has several limitations. For example in asthma, FeNO is especially a marker of allergic inflammation and therefore of limited use in non-allergic patients [4]. Consequently, additional exhaled biomarkers were studied. Next to non-volatile biomarkers that can be assessed in exhaled breath condensate, the analysis of exhaled VOCs gained popularity. VOCs are a diverse group of carbon-based chemicals that are volatile at room temperature. The source of exhaled VOCs can be exogenous or endogenous. Some VOCs can be taken up as pollutants from the environment via the skin or by inhalation or ingestion. Subsequently, these compounds are metabolized and exhaled. Other VOCs are formed in the body during several (patho)physiological processes [5,6]. An important group of endogenously formed VOCs are hydrocarbons that are formed by lipid peroxidation. During the inflammatory process, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are produced by inflammatory cells. Subsequently, ROS react with lipid membrane structures and cause degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As a result several stable breakdown products including hydrocarbons are formed [5,6]. Besides hydrocarbons, other VOCs can be identified, including nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur containing compounds. These VOCs can be formed by bacteria or during (patho)physiological processes in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas [5,6]. As soon as VOCs are formed, they are either further oxidized into smaller components due to enhanced activity of enzymes (such as cytochrome P450 oxidase), or they directly enter the bloodstream [7]. Subsequently, VOCs are excreted into breath. Early findings of distinct VOCs in diseased people (e.g. with diabetes or cirrhosis) compared to healthy controls stimulated investigators to elucidate the clinical potential of exhaled VOCs in pulmonary diseases [5]. Since exhaled VOCs are formed during inflammatory processes, the analysis of VOCs may be a promising non-invasive technique to directly monitor inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways. This information might be of help in the diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary diseases.",

The most commonly used techniques are gas chromatography (GC), which is the gold standard, and the electronic nose (eNose). With the GC-technique, exhaled breath is firstly collected and temporarily stored (e.g. in inert bags or sorption tubes). After a desorption phase, individual VOCs can be assessed by GC usually followed by mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or flame ionization detection (GC-FID) [6]. The diverse VOCs are first separated based on their chemical properties and consecutively ionized and separated by their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio (Figure 2). Breath samples can also be analyzed using an eNose [9]. The eNose consists of an array of nanosensors. When these sensors are exposed to a mixture of VOCs, a change in their electrical resistance is induced, leading to the production of a \u2018breath-print\u2019 (Figure 3). This breath-print represents the complex mixture of exhaled VOCs and can be used for pattern-recognition algorithms in multiple diseases [10-13]. A limitation of the eNose is that it is unable to analyze individual VOCs. In addition to GC and the eNose, other techniques that are used to study VOCs in pulmonary diseases include; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), laser spectroscopy, colorimetric sensor array, and gold nano particles sensors (GNPs).",

Dallinga and Caldeira et al. demonstrated that VOCs profiling was able to accurately distinguish children with asthma from controls [17-19]. With respect to differential diagnosis, it was demonstrated that an eNose VOCs profile was able to discriminate between asthma and COPD patients (Table 4) [15,32]. An external validation study demonstrated that not only \u2018classical\u2019 asthmatic patients (with reversible airway obstruction) but also asthmatic patients with fixed airway obstruction could be distinguished from COPD patients [27]. As these latter two groups usually have similar symptoms and overlapping spirometry, differential diagnosis is often difficult. These findings imply that VOCs profiling is of additional value in the differential diagnosis of asthma and COPD.",

Regarding asthma control, higher exhaled pentane levels were found in asthmatic patients with an exacerbation compared to controls. Once the asthma exacerbation subsidized, pentane levels decreased to levels comparable to controls [23]. Moreover, Ibrahim demonstrated that VOCs profiles were able to diagnose sputum eosinophilia and identify patients with poor disease control [20]. Taken together, VOCs profiling might be useful for an asthma diagnosis, for differentiating asthma from COPD, and for assessing asthma control.

In general, the number of VOCs per model ranged from 7 to 33, with a sensitivity of 50-100% and a specificity of 80-100% (Table 3). These studies, together with studies investigating single VOCs, revealed that the discriminative VOCs were predominantly alkanes (e.g. pentane, butane, propane), alkane derivates (e.g. propanol, multiple aldehydes) and benzene derivates (e.g. ethyl-, propylbenzene) (Table 2) [42,43,45,48,57,59-63,65,66]. Although most VOCs levels were elevated, certain levels (e.g. of isoprene) were decreased in patients compared to controls [41,58,66]. The diagnostic potential of VOCs profiles in LC was also demonstrated by groups that used eNose and other sophisticated techniques [11-13,44,51-53,64,67]. Moreover, breath profiles were different in patients with dissimilar histology (adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma) [51]. Besides, Peng et al. demonstrated distinct VOCs profiles in patients with lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancer [53].

            "text": "A substantial increase in clinical studies on VOCs in pulmonary diseases was observed in the last decade. Initial studies on VOCs identified biomarkers in a traditional way by focusing on single compounds based on biological insight. Levels of several VOCs were demonstrated to be distinct in people with a pulmonary disease compared to controls. These markers mainly included alkanes for asthma and COPD; alkanes, alkenes and alkene-derivates for CF and analogous compounds plus benzene derivates and aldehydes in lung cancer. Due to overlap in markers, one may argue that a disease specific biomarker is not discovered yet. For example, ethane was not only elevated in asthmatic patients, but also in COPD and CF patients. Similarly, decreased levels of isoprene were found in both children with CF, asthmatic patients, lung cancer patients and in patients with ARDS. Despite the lack of a single discriminative biomarker, these studies did demonstrate that exhaled breath of patients with a particular lung disease is distinct from healthy controls. This finding evolved in a new hypothesis that pulmonary diseases are characterized by a distinctive breath-print that is not based on single markers, but on a profile of numerous VOCs. Instead of a knowledge based strategy, recent studies mainly support an inductive strategy to discover disease-specific VOCs profiles. Owing to recent technical and analytical advancements, hundreds of VOCs can be analyzed to characterize the breath-print of a pulmonary disease. Various research groups demonstrated that, either by using the eNose or GC, VOCs profiles of patients with several pulmonary diseases could be well distinguished from VOCs profiles of controls. Moreover, distinct VOCs profiles were found in patients with dissimilar pulmonary diseases. These promising results pave the way for the development of a non-invasive diagnostic tool based on exhaled VOCs.",

Although VOCs can have an exogenous origin, numerous VOCs are formed within the airways as a result of local inflammatory or neoplastic processes. Therefore, the analysis of exhaled VOCs can serve as a direct measure of lung status. Nevertheless, since VOCs are blood-borne they can also reflect other processes in the body and thus may assess different body functions in a flexible manner. Secondly, collection of breath samples is safe, non-invasive and easy to perform even in children and more severe patients. Breath collection does not require skilled medical staff and obtaining large quantities or repeated measurements are not as bothersome for patients compared to e.g. blood sampling, sputum induction or bronchoalveolar lavages. Moreover, the matrix of exhaled breath is less complex than blood or urine, eliminating the need for complicated work-up of samples. Finally, techniques to measure VOCs, such as GC-MS, are very sensitive to detect compounds and techniques such as the IMS allow real-time measurement of compounds in the body.",

            "text": "Although VOCs profiling is a potential clinical tool, considerable work needs to be done before it can be applied into clinical practice. An important step that needs to be taken is extensive validation of the current available VOCs profiles. Next to (external) validation, standardization in collecting and analyzing VOCs is necessary to enhance inter-laboratory comparability. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies (in study design, sampling and analytical techniques) a variety of results is reported, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions or to calculate an algorithm for the most important compounds in the diverse pulmonary diseases. In the standardization procedure, the influence of potential confounders needs to be explored before considering VOCs as a clinical tool [48]. As described before, exhaled VOCs can arise from various endogenous and exogenous sources. Consequently, numerous environmental-, subject- and analytical factors can influence the exhaled VOCs pattern (Table 5). For example, air pollution, smoking, eating, drinking and medication use can considerably affect the composition of exhaled VOCs [85]. Also the presence of bacteria can alter exhaled VOCs patterns (hence breath analysis could be used to identify bacterial infections and bacterial-induced diseases). This suggests that these factors should be taken into account when constructing a diagnostic tool on basis of VOCs patterns. Moreover, potential confounders on analytical level should be carefully studied. For example, during the offline-procedure of exhaled VOCs collection, Tedlar bags could release VOCs into the collected breath, and storage onto Tenax columns can disturb the composition of the breath. As the pool of exhaled VOCs arises from multiple endogenous and exogenous sources, the analysis of background samples and standardization of the analysis per technique is necessary. A list of recommendations for measurements composed by experts, as was provided for markers in exhaled breath condensate, will facilitate standardization [86]. Thirdly, more insight is needed in the physiological meaning and biochemical origin of endogenous formed VOCs. However, this might be difficult since, as described before, the origin of VOCs is blood-borne and therefore can be the result of widely different biochemical pathways (so the previously mentioned advantage of VOCs is a disadvantage as well). Fourthly, more research is needed on the potential of VOCs in differential diagnosis and monitoring purposes. Besides these four major \u2018missions\u2019, others aspects of VOCs assessment and analysis can be improved. Although breath samples are easy to collect, the analysis of VOCs is still quite cumbersome and time-consuming and requires trained personnel. Moreover, further refinement of sampling techniques, exploring advanced statistical techniques on the multi-data of VOCs to build diagnostic and prognostic models, and developing new tools that combine the strengths of the eNose (cheap, time efficient), IMS (real-time), and GC-MS (sensitive, compound identification) will facilitate the introduction of VOCs into clinical practice.",

With the gas chromatography (GC) technique, exhaled breath is collected and temporarily stored in e.g. gas-tight syringes, glass bulbs, inert bags, or metal containers. Once the VOCs are collected and temporarily trapped, they can be released for analysis. This is often performed by solvent or thermal desorption. Subsequently, the analysis of individual molecular components can be assessed by GC usually followed by mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The diverse VOCs are separated and quantified by using their specific compound characteristics. Distinct VOCs have dissimilar progression rates and reach the end of the GC column at different time points; the retention time. Based on their retention time, VOCs can be identified in a mass-spectra library. The figure demonstrates an example of a chromatogram of a breath sample analyzed with GC. The retention time (in minutes) is stated on the x axis, while the y axis shows the relative abundance of various compound signals. Published in Robroeks et al. Pediatr Res 2010 [14].",

This breath-print represents the complex mixture of exhaled VOCs and can be used for pattern-recognition algorithms in multiple diseases. A limitation of the eNose is that it is unable to analyze individual VOCs. In the figure two exhaled breath-prints analyzed with the eNose are demonstrated (purple line represents sample 1, green line represents sample 2).
