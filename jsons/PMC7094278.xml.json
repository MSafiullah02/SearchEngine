However, the use of native peptide for clinical applications has been hampered by their intrinsic metabolic instability (indigestion by enzymes) and poor absorption through membrane. A cleavable peptide of SARS CoV Mpro means that it possesses a competent binding with its receptor and a breakable peptide bond in the cleavage site. To convert a cleavable peptide into a stable and effective inhibitor, the peptide has to be modified according to the \u201cdistorted key\u201d theory [14], [15]. One important step for the chemical modification is a good understanding of the cleavage mechanism, particularly the changes in chemical bonds [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].",

Occasionally, the susceptible sites in some proteins may contain one subsite less or one more. However, eight amino acid residues are the most common case. Although the protein being cleaved contains much more than eight amino acid residues, only an octapeptide segment fits in the active region of the protease. Therefore, our research will focus on the cleavability of octapeptides.",

In Fig. 1B the breakable peptide bond between R1 and R1 is converted to a strong \u201chybrid peptide bond\u201d through a chemical modification and hence cannot be cleaved by the protease. The modified octapeptide can still bind to the active site, but it cannot be cleaved by the enzyme, just like a distorted key that can neither open the lock nor be pulled out. The octapeptide thus modified will automatically become a desired inhibitor candidate.",

In this research we study the cleavage mechanism, the properties of the relevant chemical bonds, and the catalytic interactions between the octapeptides and the SARS CoV Mpro using molecular mechanical and quantum chemical simulations to provide useful insights for the chemical modification. The study was carried out in the following four steps: (1) docking the octapeptide to SARS CoV Mpro followed by an energy minimization for the complex structure using molecular mechanics, (2) computing the atomic charge distribution in the binding pocket for the energy-minimized structure using ab initio quantum mechanics, (3) computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the octapeptide with the background charge distribution [23] of SARS CoV Mpro using ab initio quantum chemistry, and (4) with the same background charge distribution, computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the modified octapeptide. The computations have been carried out with the molecular dynamics and standard ab initio quantum chemistry at the HF/6-31G* level [23].",

The N finger of protomer B plugs into the domain II of protomer A and plays an important role in the catalytic activity. The PDB data of SARS CoV Mpro contains 300 hydration water molecules, which provide the solvation ion environment with some water molecules joining the catalytic reaction. In Fig. 2A the green signs \u201c<\u201d represent the solvation water molecules. The docking calculation between SARS CoV Mpro and the octapeptide AVLQSGFR was performed using the molecular operating environment program package [24]. A total of 25 docking conformations were obtained, and the one with the lowest energy was used for further energy minimizing calculation.

Figs. 4\nA and B are the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of octapeptide AVLQSGFR and the catalytic active region of SARS CoV Mpro, respectively.

There is good hydrophilic and hydrophobic complementary interaction between ligand and receptor: the hydrophilic parts of the ligand correspond to the hydrophilic parts of the receptor and the hydrophobic parts of the ligand correspond to the hydrophobic parts of the receptor. The octapeptide NH2-AVLQ \u2193 SGFR-COOH has four hydrophobic amino acid residues: R4(Ala), R3(Val), R3\u2032(Phe), and R4\u2032(Arg).

The cleavage specificity of SARS CoV Mpro concentrates on the sites R2, R1, and R1\u2032. The development of peptides as clinically useful drugs is limited by their poor stability and bioavailability, which is due in part to their inability to readily cross membrane barriers such as the intestinal and blood\u2013brain barriers. Systematic chemical modification strategies that convert peptides into drugs are an attractive research topic in current medicinal chemistry [28]. For the peptide inhibitor of proteinase, the chemical modification to cleavable octapeptide should focus on the scissile peptide bond between R1 and R1\u2032 to be cleaved by SARS CoV Mpro.
