CDC data on COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality rates show a higher incidence among racial and ethnic minorities, males, the elderly, and people living in less dense areas. 1 These data are consistent with media reports from specific areas of higher hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 among African-Americans and lower SES individuals. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Public health efforts to reduce COVID-19 spread will thus need to focus particularly on these traditionally disadvantaged population groups. However, such efforts have historically had more difficulty making inroads in marginalized groups. For example, rates of smoking and obesity are higher among lower socioeconomic status groups, and trust in healthcare is lower among racial minorities. 8, 9, 10 Further, several polls have demonstrated a partisan divide whereby right-leaning media outlets have and individuals who consume them are skeptical about the threat posed by COVID-19 and of efforts to reduce its spread. 11, 12 This raises concerns that the COVID-19 response will be hampered by differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors among racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, or groups with differing political orientations in the population.",

Such high levels of knowledge for a novel disease testify to the role of public health officials and the news media in explaining the basics of disease spread. Yet African Americans, men and younger people, the very same groups which report higher COVID-19 exposure, have less accurate knowledge than white Americans, women and older individuals. The gaps are consistently largest for African-American respondents who are less likely to know about fomite transmission, asymptomatic transmission, respiratory droplet transmission or name three common symptoms of COVID-19.",

Some of the difference in behavior may be related to social circumstance. For example, African-Americans less likely to be able to telecommute and more likely to work in the service sector and use public transportation than other racial/ethnic groups (23% among African-Americans vs. 15% among Hispanics and 7% among whites). 14 Strikingly, knowledge and behaviors are closely related; groups where behaviors put people more at risk for disease are also groups where knowledge of appropriate behaviors are weakest. The results suggest that greater efforts to communicate risk and safe practices to racial/ethnic minorities and younger people may be particularly crucial moving forward.",

The results are overall consistent with those reported in the main text. Very similar effects are found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms.
