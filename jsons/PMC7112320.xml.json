Findings from a study by Phagoo et al12 demonstrated that NPIF and, to a lesser extent, NPEF were altered by changes in intrapulmonary airway dimensions. The authors stated that NPIF and NPEF may give a false impression of nasal patency when effort is submaximal, intrapulmonary dynamic resistance is increased, or nasal dynamic resistance is low. They suggested that false readings could be avoided by comparing mouth peak flow and/or mouth peak inspiratory flow with that of NPIF and NPEF.12\n",

Several studies have compared nasal peak flow measurements with rhinomanometry and visual analogue scales in the determination of nasal obstruction with conflicting results.

Clarke et al18 found nasal peak flow a relatively insensitive measure compared with rhinomanometry. Larsen and Kristensen19 saw a poor intraindividual correlation. Jones et al20 and Fairley et al21 saw a strong correlation with subjective nasal sensation. In addition, Jones et al20 found a high correlation between NAR, as measured by anterior rhinomanometry, and NPIF and concluded that NPIF was as good an indication of objective nasal patency as NAR measured by rhinomanometry.20 Holmstrom et al10 found a good correlation of NPIF with rhinomanometry, and a significant correlation has also been shown between NPIF and forced inspiratory volume in 1 second.22 Fr\u00f8lund et al6 studied the relationship between posterior rhinomanometry and NPEF in healthy subjects and patients with rhinitis. A significant correlation was found between posterior rhinomanometry and NPEF when patients were stratified by rhinitis diagnosis and height. The authors concluded that posterior rhinomanometry is an appropriate method for clinic use, and that NPEF is an easy method for measuring nasal patency and may be suitable for home use.",

Its portability allows objective assessment of occupationally induced nasal obstruction. Nasal peak flow can assess the acute effect on nasal blockage before and after dosing with a pharmacologic agent or with a provocative stimulus. It can also assess changes over longer periods. For example, after nasal allergen provocation, nasal peak flow measurements can assess the late phase reaction at home. This technique can establish the effect of corticosteroids on nasal polyposis and can be used for preoperative and postoperative assessment of septoplasty or turbinectomy. Nasal peak flow is also potentially useful in assessing functional nasal problems and for medical legal assessment.",

One solution is to quantify the extremes of unilateral resistance or the amplitude of the unilateral changes in resistance over a period of several hours. This approach has been used to determine the unilateral changes in resistance in health,52 common cold,50 and hay fever,53 to assess the effects of oral decongestants,54 and to assess the efficacy of nasal surgery.55 The disadvantage of unilateral nasal measurements is that to assess the amplitude of changes in unilateral nasal resistance it is necessary to make measurements over several hours.

In active anterior rhinomanometry, the pressure-sensing tube is normally taped to one nasal passage. The sealed nasal passage acts as an extension of the pressure-sensing tube to measure pressure in the posterior nares. With this method, nasal airflow is measured from one nostril at a time and the pressure-sensing tube is swapped from one side to the other. Therefore, the pressure/flow curves and nasal resistance or conductance measurements are determined separately for each nasal passage and the total is then calculated. The major disadvantage of the anterior method is that it is impossible to make any measurements if one of the nasal passages is completely obstructed. This is a significant limitation of the anterior rhinomanometric method and a deciding factor in preference for posterior rhinomanometry as a standard technique, because patients with rhinitis often have obstruction of one nasal passage, and it would not be possible to include these patients in any study in which anterior rhinomanometry was the preferred measure of nasal conductance.",

For measurement, the patient sits in the upright position, clears their nose of secretions, and places the disposable nosepiece attached to the end of the acoustic rhinometry tube into a nostril. Different size nosepieces are available and should fit comfortably but firmly into the external nares to ensure an airtight seal. In some instances, it may be necessary to apply a proprietary soft paraffin wax to ensure an airtight seal. Measurements are made separately for each nostril. It is suggested that subjects keep their eyes focused on a point marked on a wall to keep the same head position during repeated measurements. Studies have evaluated the use of a head frame to fix the head rigidly in a set position, but this approach has not been found to provide better results80; rather paradoxically, the results have been reported to be less repeatable under such circumstances. However, the angle of the rhinometry tube is important, because the axis at which the sound travels in the nasal cavity should be parallel to the nasal floor from the nasal valve, and alterations influence the measurement.81, 82 Measurements are made during breath holding, as the area-distance function may be affected by breathing.83 The measurements are passive and require no other cooperation from the patient.",

Thus, for repeated measures on separate days as part of a drug intervention study, measures should be undertaken at the same time of day. Because a classic nasal cycle is associated with alternating congestion/decongestion cycles matched by the opposite in the other nostril, the sum of the 2 sides is usually constant. In contrast with measures of nasal airflow, which have indicated that such reciprocating cycles occur in as many as 80% of subjects,87 acoustic rhinometry measures of nasal volume have revealed such changes in only 25% to 50% of subjects.75, 88, 89 In one small study of 12 subjects without allergy, repeated measurements of nasal volume, minimal cross-sectional area, and the area of the anterior end of the inferior turbinate every 15 minutes for 6 hours revealed a coefficient of variation of 9.4%, 11.3%, and 17.8%, respectively.90 The variability was significantly larger in subjects with allergy, with a coefficient of variation for the nasal volume measurement of 14%.90\n",

In allergic rhinitis, hyperresponsiveness may also be involved in the phenomenon of priming to allergen, which has been described by several investigators.152, 153 Priming can be viewed as an augmentation of the acute allergic reaction to allergen by repeated exposures. Although priming probably involves several mechanisms, it may be partly explained by allergen-induced increased responsiveness to the products of an allergic reaction, namely histamine,154 sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, or prostaglandin D2.",

Capsaicin stimulates a specific vanilloid receptor167, 168 on sensory nerve endings to induce a central reflex with its efferent arm leading to cholinergic glandular activation.168, 169 Capsaicin induces a strong burning sensation but only induces sneezing at very low doses. In addition to the generation of neural reflexes, capsaicin can result in local release of neuropeptides by sensory nerve endings. These peptides can also stimulate glands and may induce plasma exudation from adjacent blood vessels. In the human nose, high doses of capsaicin may yield evidence of plasma exudation, but only in patients with active allergic rhinitis.170 Despite this, it is difficult to define rhinitis by capsaicin provocation because of a considerable variability in response, and intranasal challenge cannot identify a particular type of nasal hyperresponsiveness. On the other hand, the ipsilateral and contralateral nostril secretory response to unilateral capsaicin provocation using the filter paper technique allows for a clear differentiation between healthy subjects and patients with active allergic rhinitis, with the ED50 100-fold lower in the latter.171\n",

It induces sensory nerve activation leading to sneezing, pruritus, cholinergically mediated glandular secretions, and possibly even reflex vasodilation, which may be a cholinergic effect. In addition, histamine has a direct effect on the vasculature leading to vasodilation of the capacitance vessels and plasma exudation from the postcapillary venules of the subepithelial plexus. It is not clear whether histamine can directly activate the nasal glandular apparatus.179 Despite the complicated effects of histamine on the nasal mucosa, the methodology of the provocation permits differentiation of various aspects of nasal hyperresponsiveness. First, histamine-induced sneezing is a quite clean outcome, reflecting sensory neural function, and can be used to assess sensorineural hyperresponsiveness. Second, evaluation of the content of histamine-induced nasal secretions in markers of plasma extravasation can be used as a measure of vascular hyperpermeability, a form of nasal hyperresponsiveness. One can also measure changes in nasal airflow after unilateral histamine challenge and separate the ipsilateral from the contralateral to the challenge nostrils. This technique may allow an assessment of the direct effects of histamine on the capacitance vessels (by subtracting the changes in the contralateral from the ipsilateral nasal passage). Alternatively, pretreatment of the challenged nostril with a local anesthetic may reveal only the direct, as opposed to the indirect (neural), effects of histamine provocation on nasal airflow.",

In this respect, bradykinin does not appear to differentiate patients with active allergic rhinitis from healthy controls.181 However, in a study by Riccio and Proud,181 healthy subjects or patients with SAR, when tested out of the pollen season, generate minimal secretory responses to bradykinin and no sneezing. In contrast, both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions to unilateral, localized bradykinin provocation, as well as sneezes, are induced in patients with PAR and in those with symptomatic seasonal disease. This indicates that, in the presence of active allergic disease, a sensorineural response to bradykinin is induced. However, there are some discrepancies between this study and a study reported by Baraniuk et al.182 Thus, more work with bradykinin in the nose will be required to obtain a more concrete impression of its potential usefulness as a tool to examine specific forms of nasal hyperresponsiveness. Studies on the effects of anti-inflammatory agents on hyperresponsiveness to bradykinin have not been performed. Neither do we know whether experimental allergen provocation can change as well as augment the qualitative characteristics of the responsiveness to bradykinin. However, it is worth mentioning that, in the lower airways of patients with asthma, responsiveness to bradykinin increases dramatically 24 to 48 hours after allergen inhalation challenge, much more so than the responsiveness to methacholine.183 Inversely, bronchial responsiveness to bradykinin can be dramatically reduced with inhaled glucocorticosteroids.184\n",

Collected secretions can be eluted from the filter paper, and limited biochemical evaluations can be performed.

Furthermore, nasal symptomatology is frequently episodic, and daily measurements of airflow may not track the natural presentation of the disease. By assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness, one can obtain a better picture of the propensity of a patient to develop symptoms in response to frequently encountered environmental stimuli. Most importantly, if measures of nasal hyperresponsiveness are performed by using methodologies that can dissect the various functions of the nose, as discussed, various clinical phenotypes and their response to treatment could be correlated to a particular aspect of hyperresponsiveness in a patient-tailored fashion. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization and validation of methodologies to assess nasal hyperresponsiveness means that only scattered data are available on the effects of therapeutic agents, and, even worse, none from large-scale clinical trials.",

            "text": "Objective measures exist for the measurement of nasal patency. Nasal peak flow is an inexpensive, noninvasive, portable, and relatively simple measure that reflects changes in nasal luminal patency. Nasal peak flow is the only validated method suitable for home use, and studies have demonstrated that, when used correctly, the method is reproducible, correlates with both subjective and other objective measures, and may therefore provide a viable method for the outpatient monitoring of nasal patency. NPIF has better reproducibility than NPEF and is the best validated and studied nasal peak flow measurement. Such use would be most appropriate in persistent rather than intermittent disease, because measurement at set times of the day may not reflect episodic events. Within the laboratory, rhinomanometry is the standard technique used for the measurement of nasal resistance, and measurements are relatively easy and are reproducible. This approach is thus commonly used in nasal challenge studies. Such measures are more discerning than those of peak flow. The equipment is not portable and thus not available for home monitoring. The instability of nasal resistance means that only relatively large changes in resistance can be studied in clinical trials, when occasional clinic visit measurements are made, but despite this, such measurements have been able to demonstrate the efficacy of medications such as nasal steroids in allergic rhinitis. A nonphysiologic measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. Using sound waves and their echo reflection, this technique measures intranasal volume and a-min within the nose. This method of measurement correlates well with rhinomanometry and NPIF and is easy to undertake. Acoustic rhinometry has advantages in that it needs little patient cooperation in the measurements and is a repeatable method of measurement. Measures of nasal patency, although they provide objective outcome measures, reflect only 1 aspect of rhinitis and may thus not encompass all aspects of the disease. It is recognized that there may be altered mucociliary clearance and abnormal nasal airway reactivity in rhinitis. Measures of mucociliary clearance, although simple and easily applicable clinically, are poorly repeatable. To provide a more integrated measure of abnormal nasal airway physiology, nasal challenge testing to measure nasal reactivity has been used.",

From this perspective, evaluation of this phenomenon can potentially complement currently assessed parameters, such as symptoms, quality of life outcomes, and use of rescue medications. However, hyperresponsiveness is a very complex phenomenon that involves a range of potential abnormalities in the various functional elements of the nasal mucosa. Standardized methodologies assessing these abnormalities are not sufficiently developed, and the relationship between such abnormalities and disease presentation has not been vigorously examined.
