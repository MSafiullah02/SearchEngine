Plainly put, they ask the question: should health authorities place potentially exposed individuals into a quarantine setting where their separation from others can be enforced, or should authorities simply let them go home, ask them to avoid contacts, and monitor them for COVID-19 symptoms through phone calls or health-care visits? The authors name the two options individual quarantine and active monitoring, respectively. Individual quarantine impinges more on civil liberties but is less risky from a public health perspective. Aware of this dilemma, Peak and colleagues1 use a mathematical model of the early spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections to establish the conditions under which individual quarantine works better than active monitoring.",

They either both contain the outbreak, or they both do not contain it. However, an important exception occurs if the serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector and their infectees) of the infection2 is around 4\u00b78 days, and if at least 75% of infected contacts are identified within 12 h, on average. Under those circumstances, individual quarantine could contain an outbreak, whereas active monitoring could not. This prediction appears to be consistent with another recently published model of COVID-19 containment.3 Crucially, this analysis assumes that testing is rapid and widely available, which is not true for many places.",

This rate might be impractical with manual contact tracing, depending on the route of transmission. Interviews with individuals are stymied by problems of cognitive bias, inability of individuals to remember their detailed movements, and difficulty in identifying contacts unknown to the patient. By contrast, digital technologies offer vast improvements in terms of location accuracy and contact identification;3 these technologies put the 75% target within reach, as the experience of South Korea with COVID-19 has shown.4 However, using digital surveillance to reach the target would then present two infringements on civil liberties: individuals must be tracked to capture enough infected contacts, and those contacts must be individually quarantined. And even if contact tracing fails to contain an outbreak, the combined effect of physical distancing and contact tracing is greater than the effect of either intervention on its own.1 Hence, the authors' analysis tells us that many decision makers will need to choose whether to use digital surveillance.",

However, we suggest that mathematical models should go beyond addressing strictly epidemiological questions. The pandemic has affected almost every aspect of our individual and collective lives, and our own reactions to the pandemic shape the outbreaks we experience. Hence, we think researchers should broaden their focus to developing models that explicitly include relevant social processes, equity considerations, and economic impacts in the model structure. There is already a precedent for this approach in modelling endemic infectious diseases5, 6 and in other fields of natural systems modelling.7\n",

Contact tracing represents a race to trace.8 To prevent exponential growth in the number of cases, public health must trace contacts of infected cases and reduce their chances of causing further spread faster than the virus propagates through the network of personal contacts. Thus, intrusive action in the early stages of a pandemic might reduce how much longer those intrusive measures have to be applied, and to how many people. Additionally, benefits for other fundamental rights are accrued as the pandemic unfolds, such as saving both lives and livelihoods.9\n",
