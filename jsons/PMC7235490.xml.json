Low\u2010resource countries with weakened healthcare systems are likely to become overwhelmed with a sudden surge of cases due to exponential growth and community transmission. Therefore, it becomes all the more imperative to consider measures such as social distancing and complete lockdowns with a great deal of seriousness, in order to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and prevent hospitals from being overburdened. Dermatologists in China have participated in the fight against COVID\u201019 and treated effectively a broad spectrum of skin conditions in such patients.\n1\n Dermatologists on the frontline can diagnose viral\u2010like exanthems related to COVID\u201019, distinguish whether skin lesions such as acute urticaria and other pruritic manifestations could be caused by pneumonia or preexisting skin disease, and identify drug eruptions.1, 2\n",

Many dermatologists have not dealt with critical patients for years and should not be expected to retool themselves in a flash.\n3\n Medical boards and critical care associations must provide refresher training in various aspects of critical care to dermatologists. There is an urgent need to initiate training of redeployed dermatologists and other physicians now and not after hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) become overwhelmed with patients.",

They should receive training in simple procedures such as vascular access, straightforward intubations, proning maneuvers, and fluid management in uncomplicated patients in order to take off some of the pressure from ICU staff. As the focus shifts from containment efforts to disease mitigation, the healthcare community must step up as a whole to lend its expertise as never before.",

This confirms the altruistic mentality of physicians as they are not averse to stepping outside of their comfort zones for the greater good of society.\n5\n These are exceptional times that call for exceptional measures.
