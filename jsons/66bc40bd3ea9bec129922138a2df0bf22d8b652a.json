He denied any fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or malaise.

The trial compared the outcomes of patients who received nebulized interferon alfa-2b or umifenovir monotherapy, versus combination of interferon alfa-2b with umifenovir. The study investigators showed that patients who received interferon therapy experienced more rapid viral clearance compared to those treated with umifenovir alone. The retrospective design of this study in addition to an imbalance in patient demographics at baseline (patients on umifenovir monotherapy were older, had more co-morbidities and presented for admission later in course of their disease) makes it difficult to extrapolate data to a broader patient population. Despite these limitations, this study presents some evidence of the role of interferon in the management of COVID-19 that could be corroborated in future clinical trials [19] .",

This could be due to the fact that they only only received 1 or 2 doses, which may not have been sufficient to elicit the toxic side effects usually observed with prolonged pegylated interferon alfa 2a therapy (including hepatoxicity, bone marrow suppression and neuropsychiatric side effects).",

A computed tomography (CT) scan on March 9 showed diffuse bilateral confluent and patchy ground glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities in both lungs, predominantly in right upper and left lower lobes. A sputum culture with gram stain as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus nasal swab were collected, and an empiric antibacterial regimen of cefepime and intravenous vancomycin was initiated to cover a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. The diagnosis was modified to COVID-19, severe pneumonia. The patient continued to have persistent fever and peginterferon alfa 2a was started on March 11 (hospital day 11) at 180 \u00b5g for 1 dose administered subcutaneously. Cefepime and vancomycin were de-escalated to amoxicillin-clavulanate when sputum culture showed growth of normal oral flora and the MRSA nasal swab was negative. The next day after peginterferon administration, the patient became afebrile. No adverse event was reported. The supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation level returned to 96 -97% on March 14 (hospital day 14) when breathing ambient air. Test results on the following day showed recovered lymphocyte count to 1.06 cells/\u00b5L. CRP returned to normal range. A repeat chest X-ray showed partial resolution of previous lesions (Figure 1A). Two consecutive oropharyngeal swabs on March 12 and March 13 were both negative for SARS-CoV-2 and a sputum sample was also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f negative on March 14 for SARS-CoV-2. Over the next few days, his clinical status gradually improved. The patient was discharged on March 18 (hospital day 18).",

The patient had returned from a trip to New York city one week earlier. He reported fever, malaise, myalgias and diarrhea. On admission, he was febrile (38.1\u00b0C), blood pressure 136/63 mmHg, pulse 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% when breathing ambient air. His lungs were clear on auscultation. Laboratory studies revealed a slightly elevated CRP of 20 mg/L and elevated ferritin of 1,267 \u00b5g/L(Table 1). All other laboratory tests were within normal limits. The respiratory viral panel was negative for influenza A and B and MERS-CoV. A chest X-ray was done on admission and revealed clear lungs, with no apparent infiltrates. The patient was started on lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f orally twice daily and favipiravir at a loading dose of 1,600 mg orally every 12 hours followed by 600 mg orally every 8 hours, for COVID-19, and were continued for 10 days.On March 25 (hospital day 3) the patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 93% and he was started on oxygen 2 L/min. A CT scan of the chest was done and showed bilateral ground glass opacities, with distribution more noted in the lower lobes (Figure 1C). This was accompanied by an increase in the CRP to 39.3 mg/L. Based on the deterioration of the patient's state he was started on peginterferon alfa 2a 180 \u00b5g per week for 2 doses administered subcutaneously.His fever subsided the day after initiating peginterferon alfa 2a. His condition improved over the next few days, and his oxygen saturation returned to 98% on March 31 (hospital day 9).Negative PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on March 28 and March 29. The sputum sample was also negative for SARS-CoV-2 on March 30. The chest X-ray showed unchanged infiltrates on March 28 (hospital day 6). (Figure 1C). Inflammatory markers continued to decrease, including CRP level of 33.9 mg/L and ferritin 927 \u00b5g/L. He was discharged on April 2, 2020 (hospital day 11).DiscussionAlthough there has been a plethora of publications on the clinical presentation andmanagement of COVID-19 over the past three months, our understanding of the pathophysiological changes in this infection remains limited. To date, there is no definite treatment identified which makes management of this disease challenging. Here we present a case series of three patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were treated with pegylated interferon alfa 2a. The patients had virological clearance within a few days of treatment and improvement of the clinical condition as reflected by the decrease in oxygen requirements, normalization of reactive parameters and improvement of radiological J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f abnormalities. None of the mentioned patients progressed to require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).",

Second, all patients were treated with multiple other agents (including antiretrovirals, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine), and it is not possible to determine whether the improvement observed could have been related to other therapies or attributed solely to the pegylated interferon. Third, the timing of administration of this medication was not standardized along the course of illness, making it difficult to ascertain the same outcomes in other patients if used. Additional clinical trials will enhance our understanding of the role of interferon in COVID-19 management and there are several ongoing registered clinical trials investigating the role of interferon alfa and interferon beta in COVID-19 alone and in combination with various agents, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and/or ribavirin [21].",
