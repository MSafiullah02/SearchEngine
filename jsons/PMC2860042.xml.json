These countries have a disproportionate amount of disease due to neurologic damage associated with trauma and asphyxia at birth, but infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are also over-represented as a cause of death and long-term disability. Some infections, such as bacterial meningitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia, are important causes of CNS disease worldwide, while infections such as cerebral malaria, African trypanosomiasis and viral encephalomyelitis are often more geographically restricted. Many of the important viral neurologic infections are new diseases that have recently expanded their geographic range, spread from animal reservoirs or evolved to become more neurovirulent, while others are old diseases that continue to be problematic because of difficulties with treatment, vaccine delivery or vector control.",

These viruses are maintained in natural cycles involving both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and can increase their range and cause human disease if introduced into a new location that has appropriate hosts available to maintain the natural cycle. Modern transportation has introduced vectors that efficiently transmit arboviruses into new areas (e.g. the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus into North America and Europe) and pre-existing or new populations of competent vectors set the stage for successful establishment of viruses in new regions. The 1999 introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America from the Middle East (Gubler, 2007), the spread of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) into India, Nepal and northern Australia (Solomon et al., 2003, van den Hurk et al., 2009) and the explosive 2005\u20132007 outbreaks of Chikungunya virus infection in the Indian Ocean islands and India (Powers and Logue, 2007, Renault et al., 2007) are examples of this mechanism.",

JEV is distributed in temperate and tropical areas of eastern and southern Asia and maintained in a zoonotic cycle between Culex mosquitoes and wading birds or pigs (van den Hurk et al., 2009). Recent geographic extension to Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait of northern Australia (Fig. 1\n) may have involved viremic migratory birds or transport of infected mosquitoes by wind, land vehicles or planes. Emergence is also associated with the increases in endemic areas of population, pig production and irrigated rice farming (Erlanger et al., 2009). The case fatality rate is typically between 20% and 40% with children and the elderly at greatest risk. Effective vaccines are increasingly available and appropriate use should decrease the disease burden (Solomon, 2006).",

The introduced CHIKV strain is a variant of the Central/East African genotype that is efficiently transmitted by Aedes albopictus (Chevillon et al., 2008). Although occasionally recognized previously, large numbers of neurologic complications have been reported only recently, although the actual frequency of neurologic disease is still unclear (Arpino et al., 2009). Neurologic complications are age-dependent with the greatest susceptibility in the very young and the elderly. Encephalopathy is the main manifestation in newborns, while meningitis and encephalitis occur in older children and adults (Arpino et al., 2009, Chandak et al., 2009).",

This may result only in infection of the exposed human (e.g. rabies after a bite from a rabid animal) or in infection that has or gains the ability to spread within the human population (e.g. HIV, SARS coronavirus) (Wolfe et al., 2007). For instance, lentiviruses of primates have been transmitted on multiple occasions to humans, but only a few strains acquired the ability for human-to-human transmission to become the HIV strains that are currently prevalent in human populations around the world (Sharp et al., 2001). If, such as rabies, the virus remains a zoonosis with intermittent transmission to humans, then control of infection in animal populations is necessary to prevent human disease (Zinsstag et al., 2007). For rabies, regular vaccination of domestic dogs is the most important intervention, but much of the world remains at risk (Fig. 2\n) (Hampson et al., 2009, Rupprecht et al., 2008).",

When two different strains of influenza (e.g. an avian strain and a human strain) infect the same host cell, the new progeny viruses can reassort the two sets of eight genes with a potential for 256 different combinations of segments in individual virus particles. This process results in viruses with new properties. Most will be less \u201cfit\u201d for human infection than the original viruses, but others may be able to replicate well in humans that do not have immunity to the new virus.

Polymerase errors, plus the lack of proofreading, results in one mistake approximately every 10,000 nucleotides, an average of one error in every genome. Furthermore, progeny viruses are produced in large numbers by infected cells. Most of these mutations will be deleterious to virus growth, but will occasionally be advantageous. It has recently been shown in animal models of polio and foot and mouth disease that this ability to vary is important for virulence (Vignuzzi et al., 2006, Sanz-Ramos et al., 2008).",

This is of current importance for poliovirus where the live virus vaccine includes three strains of polio that not only mutate, but also recombine with themselves and other enteroviruses to produce new vaccine-derived strains that may have increased virulence (Cherkasova et al., 2003).",

In general, increased neurovirulence is associated with improved ability of a virus to enter the CNS and usually with more efficient replication in neurons that can result in neuronal cell death (Griffin, 1998). Another important current example is enterovirus 71 (EV71). EV71, along with other closely related type A enteroviruses, causes hand, foot and mouth disease. However, EV71 has gained the ability to invade the CNS and cause a spectrum of serious neurologic syndromes, including meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis, in young children (Modlin, 2007, Chang et al., 2007). Outbreaks in Southeast Asia began in 1997 in Malaysia. Epidemics have subsequently occurred in multiple countries in the region (Anonymous, 2009, Chang et al., 2007). In 2008, China had 500,000 cases and 200 deaths due to EV71 subgenotype C4a (Zhang et al., 2009, Anonymous, 2009). Severe disease in Asia may be related to genetic susceptibility (Chang et al., 2008). The epidemiology is reminiscent of the epidemics of polio in Europe and North America in the first half of the 20th century and suggests the need for development of a vaccine for EV71 (Modlin, 2007).",

Viruses isolated from a cluster of children with paralysis on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola were identified as mutated vaccine viruses that had circulated in an under vaccinated population for about 2 years and had reacquired neurovirulence. Subsequently, several other polio outbreaks were identified as due to vaccine-derived polioviruses that can circulate widely (Wringe et al., 2008). The strains of live attenuated vaccine viruses have only a small number of genetic changes from the wild type viruses from which they were derived (Kew et al., 2005). Revertants that re-gain a neurovirulent phenotype are selected rapidly in the intestine and shed in stool (Minor et al., 1986, Chumakov et al., 2007). Despite this, disease in vaccinees is rare because infants are protected from spread to the CNS by maternal antibody. However, spread to nonprotected individuals can occur and result in paralytic disease. Recombination between the vaccine strains, as well as other related enteroviruses, such as Coxsackie A viruses, is also frequent, although importance of this for acquisition of virulence is less clear (Chumakov et al., 2007, Cherkasova et al., 2003, Minor et al., 1986).",

With the Expanded Program on Immunization and the Measles Vaccine Initiative, coverage in many developing countries has improved. In developed countries, the second dose is generally given at school entry. In resource-poor countries, the most effective delivery has been through mass campaigns or national immunization days, a strategy pioneered by the Pan American Health Organization (Moss and Griffin, 2006). These campaigns target large proportions of the population, quickly interrupt endemic measles virus transmission and are credited with a steady decrease in the annual mortality due to measles. If campaigns are not repeated every 3\u20134 years, susceptible individuals will build up and measles will again become endemic as virus is inevitably imported from countries with continued measles transmission.",

Although these complications are relatively rare, measles in Africa often occurs in young infants most at risk for SSPE (Halsey et al., 1980, Moss et al., 2002, Grais et al., 2007, Moss et al., 2008). However, there are few reports of SSPE from Africa and those that have appeared suggest that the epidemiology may be different from that reported for the United States and Europe (Schoub et al., 1992, Carman and Johnson, 1989). Because of the difficulty of the diagnosis and a shortage both of neuroimaging facilities and neurologists, the disease may not always be recognized or reported. Alternatively, cases may be being diagnosed, but reports have not appeared in the literature (Johnston and Hauser, 2008). More research on neurologic complications of measles in developing countries will help to determine if manifestations and susceptibility differ between populations and may shed light on the poorly understood pathogenesis of SSPE.",

Furthermore, there is a risk of CNS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome when antiretroviral treatment is initiated in HIV-infected individuals with profound immunosuppression.
