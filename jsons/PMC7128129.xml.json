However, improved noninvasive diagnostic modalities for infections have allowed for early diagnosis and detection by less invasive fiberoptic bronchoscopy, thus obviating the need for surgery 3, 4, 5. The emergence of broad-spectrum triazole antifungals and liposomal\u2013lipid complex polyenes in the early 2000s 6, 7 have allowed for increased use of less toxic empiric therapy for patients with presumed fungal infections, further limiting the necessity of antecedent lung biopsy.

The implementation of rapid detection of CMV from BAL fluid in 1988 [3] and preemptive treatment strategies with ganciclovir and foscarnet [17] have led to the decline in incidence and mortality of CMV pneumonia. In addition, major shifts in antifungal treatment and prevention [18] have improved outcomes. Accordingly, we postulated that clinical practices for the diagnosis of HCT-related pulmonary disease have evolved in tandem with recent improvements in diagnostic technologies and treatments aimed at major pulmonary infections. Examination of these practices can shed light into optimal standards of care for clinical practice in a contemporary era of HCT.",

In addition, although there was a corresponding increase in the proportion of noninfectious etiologies diagnosed by lung biopsy, the overall number of these cases relative to the total number of patients at risk did not change. The low numbers of surgical biopsies after transplantation in the past 3 years suggests further reduction in the need for surgical diagnosis. In the early cohort, aspergillosis was the most common infectious diagnosis as well as the most common diagnoses overall post-transplant, consistent with well-documented observations that aspergillosis is the most common pulmonary fungal infection affecting HCT patients [19] and that focal lung lesions that persist despite antibiotic therapy are usually fungal [14]. From 2003 to 2007 the decline appeared to be driven almost entirely by the drop in Aspergillus-related lung biopsy diagnoses. In addition, there was a shift to performing biopsies on radiographically multifocal and diffuse disease, often linked to primarily noninfectious diagnoses. Diffuse infiltrates after HCT were historically associated with CMV pneumonitis [2], but this diagnosis is now rarely identified on lung biopsy, as confirmed by our data.",

Early diagnostic bronchoscopy is now recommended over empiric treatment in HCT recipients with evidence of specific pulmonary processes [23] and is likely to have higher yield when clinical suspicion of infection is high [24]. This shift in practice is illustrated by the increasing proportion of lung biopsy recipients who underwent an antecedent bronchoscopy with BAL in the late cohort compared with the early cohort. As a consequence, the cohort of patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy performed in the latter cohort are likely to be a highly selected group for whom empiric therapy with anti-infective agents did not improve the infiltrates, bronchoscopy did not yield a diagnosis, or surgery was performed for therapeutic intent. Most surgical procedures for fungal disease were performed for therapy of established Mucorales spp. infection, which were the most common invasive fungal disease in the late cohort.

The decision to refer a patient for FNA is likely due to a number of factors that vary from institution to institution, including the availability of interventional radiology, the location of the specific lesion, and clinician bias regarding the risk-to-benefit ratio, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia. The small number of FNAs may also reflect the decline in cases of aspergillosis.

Distinguishing between infectious and noninfectious etiologies when empiric therapies fail is a critical step in deciding whether to continue, withhold, or change therapy, particularly when nonaspergillus mold species are suspected. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which was introduced in the early 1990s, has reduced the morbidity associated with open lung biopsy and is now accepted and widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [31]. In situations when clinical judgment is equivocal and less invasive means are uninformative, surgical biopsy should be considered. We propose an algorithm to aid in the workup of pulmonary abnormalities after HCT, shown in Figure 2\n. This reflects the current practice at our institution and is consistent with studies investigating the yield of BAL and lung biopsy in this population [24]. Although this algorithm is based on radiographic patterns, the clinical context and clinical suspicion for a specific diagnosis and clinical feasibility of performing bronchoscopy (ie, patient characteristics, location and size of the lesion) will dictate the diagnostic workup and/or empiric management. Voriconazole is generally chosen as the first-line empiric therapy in cases of pulmonary nodules because of the frequency of aspergillosis and availability and ease of administration of the drug. Newer tablet formulations of posaconazole, which has improved bioavailability and activity against some Mucorales spp., may also be considered as an option for empiric therapy.",

Diagnostic practices in the evaluation of lung disease and use of empiric antifungals for pulmonary nodules vary from institution to institution, given the availability of specific tests, frequency of bronchoscopy, and medical practitioners who have experience in performing lung biopsy on this specialized population of immunocompromised patients. This study reflects a large academic center with a high-volume HCT practice, pulmonary services with experience with BAL in HCT, and with availability of center-specific microbiologic tests such as fungal PCR. The utilization of surgical lung biopsy observed in this study may not be applicable to clinical practice settings in which the experience with HCT is limited and those where surgical lung biopsy may be the primary means of achieving a diagnosis. In addition, this diagnostic algorithm presented must also be taken into context with local diagnostic testing options and geographic fungal epidemiology patterns. As is the case with any endpoint that rests on a clinical decision, the results may be simply based on the biases of the physician or group of physicians encountered by the patient.",

As a consequence of improved outcomes from aspergillosis, the burden of pulmonary pathology has shifted to late noninfectious complications, which is an area of unmet need in this population. Additionally, nodules due to invasive fungal disease and unresponsive to empiric therapy are largely caused by non-Aspergillus species. These observations suggest a need for further investigation into minimally invasive means of diagnosing noninfectious pulmonary complications, improved diagnostic tools, and more efficacious treatment for these important late pulmonary complications after HCT.",
