Two members of this family, dendritic cell\u2010specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non\u2010integrin (DC\u2010SIGN) and DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related (DC\u2010SIGNR), also known as liver/lymph node\u2010specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3\u2010grabbing non\u2010integrin, CLEC4M, CD299, and CD209L, have also been implicated in increasing rates of infection of several viruses, such as HIV\u20101 1, 2, 3, 4, hepatitis C virus 5, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 6, and avian H5N1 influenza 7, via binding to sugars on glycosylated proteins expressed on viral envelopes (gp120 in the case of HIV\u20101 infection). Although the complete physiological role of DC\u2010SIGNR is not known in full, it has been shown to have roles in cell adhesion 8 and cell signalling 9, and may also be involved in initiating the primary immune response through binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 3 on resting T lymphocytes 10. There is also speculation that DC\u2010SIGNR could act as an endocytic receptor by internalizing pathogens 11.",

These proteins bind glycosylated ligands and pathogens at the cell surface, internalize them, and then release them into the low\u2010pH (~ 4.5\u20135.5) environment of endosomal compartments and phagolysosomes. The internalized ligands and pathogens are processed for antigen presentation and/or degraded completely before the endocytic receptor is recycled back to the cell surface for further ligand capture 15, 16, 17, 18. Despite sharing 77% sequence identity with DC\u2010SIGN, it is currently under debate as to whether the related protein DC\u2010SIGNR (expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells found in the liver and also on selected lymphatic endothelium, placental capillary and epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract) is a recycling endocytic receptor. Studies of immobilized DC\u2010SIGNR failed to show reduced binding of 125I\u2010labelled mannose (Man)30\u2013BSA at low pH or internalization and degradation of this ligand by DC\u2010SIGNR\u2010transfected Rat\u20106 fibroblasts 17. Furthermore, DC\u2010SIGNR contains only one of the two sequence motifs (a dileucine/triacidic cluster motif and Y\u2010XX\u2010\u03a6 motif, where \u03a6 is a hydrophobic residue 12) proposed to direct localization of DC\u2010SIGN into endocytic vesicles (only the dileucine motif is conserved in DC\u2010SIGNR). As a result, some authors argue that DC\u2010SIGNR has evolved to perform different (as yet not fully characterized) biological functions from DC\u2010SIGN that do not necessarily involve ligand internalization, such as cell adhesion and leukocyte rolling.",

Similar results have been reported for the binding of DC\u2010SIGNR to HIV gp120, where a drastic reduction in binding was observed at pH values of \u2264 5.5 15. The loss of gp120 binding by DC\u2010SIGNR (and DC\u2010SIGN) at low pH was attributed to loss of the bound calcium ions in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the receptor, and was interpreted to suggest a release mechanism similar to that of DC\u2010SIGN.",

Here, we report the first assignment of the DC\u2010SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and provide direct evidence of reduced ligand\u2010binding affinity for the holo form of the CRD at low pH, by using solution NMR. In addition, we report the binding affinity of the CRD for GlcNAc3 for the first time. This addition to our growing body of ligand\u2010binding data leads us to propose that the DC\u2010SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands at reduced pH, and that the binding of Man\u2010containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc\u2010containing oligosaccharides.",

From these results, it is clear that a large conformational/dynamic change occurs throughout the CRD as a result of decreased pH, as ~ 80% of the peaks show significant chemical shift changes and/or broadening. Owing to the extent of changes in the low\u2010pH spectrum, a peak was defined as significantly perturbed if there was a large enough change in chemical shift or intensity to prevent assignment, or if the chemical shift perturbation was > 0.02 p.p.m. Thus far, attempts to assign the holo\u2010CRD at low pH have been hindered by issues with variable intensity and broadening, which we are working to overcome. In the absence of this assignment, a qualitative illustration of the regions affected by the reduction in pH is given in Fig. 1B. In Fig. 1B, the residues that showed clearly detectable chemical shift changes upon a reduction of the pH were mapped onto the crystal structure of the CRD [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=1K9J], and are shown in red (white regions are residues whose chemical shifts remained unchanged). This analysis suggests that both Ca2+\u2010binding loops (the primary loop containing residues 359\u2013364, and the secondary loop containing residues 344\u2013355), \u03b1\u2010helix 1 (residues 288\u2013298), and \u03b2\u2010sheets 6 and 7 (residues 368\u2013372 and 375\u2013379) undergo changes in their fold and/or dynamics at low pH. These regions of the protein form part of the proposed glycan\u2010binding site, and so it is possible that changes in fold and/or dynamics at low pH may modulate glycan binding. Given that the homologous protein DC\u2010SIGN is known to be an endocytic receptor, the most likely explanation for these results is that the DC\u2010SIGNR CRD releases Ca2+ at low pH. Furthermore, these pH\u2010induced changes to the HSQC spectrum of the CRD are reversible: increasing the pH back to 6.8 yielded an HSQC spectrum identical to the black spectrum shown in Fig. 1A. This type of behaviour would be expected for an endocytic receptor that is required to regain its ligand\u2010binding ability as it is recycled back to the cell surface.",

EDTA was then used as a probe to confirm that no Ca2+ was present. EDTA can be used to probe the presence of Ca2+ in solution by NMR, as the 1D/1H\u2010spectra of free and Ca2+\u2010bound EDTA can be easily distinguished 20, 21. Free EDTA results in two sharp singlet peaks resulting from the acetate\u2010methylene and amine\u2010methylene protons (labelled 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. 2A). Ca2+ binding causes splitting of the acetate\u2010methylene proton peak, whereas a singlet remains for the amine\u2010methylene protons (Fig. 2B). In the Ca2+\u2010bound form, both peaks are shifted upfield with respect to the free EDTA chemical shifts. Consequently, the addition of EDTA has been used previously to screen for the presence of Ca2+ in solution 22). Figure 2A shows the 1H\u2010spectrum of the apo\u2010CRD after addition of excess EDTA. Only peaks resulting from free EDTA are observed. Given the strong affinity of EDTA for Ca2+, it was expected that EDTA would compete with the CRD for calcium ions if any were present in the apo\u2010CRD sample. This was confirmed by addition of increasing concentrations of EDTA to a sample of the holo\u2010CRD (Fig. 2B,C), which resulted in peaks attributable to Ca2+\u2010bound EDTA. The presence of only free EDTA peaks in Fig. 2A suggests that the CRD is in the apo form and that no Ca2+ is present.",

            "text": "To measure any changes in ligand affinity at reduced pH, Man3 and GlcNAc2Man3 were titrated into separate samples of either 0.4 mm or 0.7 mm CRD, respectively, prepared at pH 4.2. The pH was adjusted, and a 1H/15N\u2010HSQC spectrum was acquired after each addition of glycan. Because carbohydrates are weak acids with pK\na values ranging from 12 to 14 23, and a reduction of the pH from 6.8 to 4.2 would therefore not affect the glycan protonation state, any changes in the HSQC spectrum upon reduction in pH were attributed to the pH dependence of the CRD. Figure 5 shows an overlay of the glycan\u2010free spectrum (black) at pH 4.2 and the spectrum obtained after addition of 5 mm Man3 (green) to a 0.4 mm solution of the CRD at the same pH. Even at this concentration of Man3, which was the highest tested and represents a 12.5\u2010fold molar excess of Man3 with respect to the CRD, no change in the HSQC spectrum was observed at pH 4.2. This is in contrast to our previous results obtained at pH 6.8, where Man3 binding resulted in several significant and obvious chemical shift perturbations (see Fig. S4 in 19), and confirms that Man3 does not bind to the CRD at pH 4.2. The ability of the CRD to release Man at low pH was investigated further by binding the CRD to a 2\u2010mL Man\u2013Sepharose column at neutral pH (pH 7.8) (see Experimental procedures) and eluting either with EDTA (Fig. 6A) or with reduction of the pH to 4.2 in an EDTA\u2010free buffer (Fig. 6B). In both cases, SDS/PAGE confirmed that DC\u2010SIGNR dissociated from the mannosylated resin and eluted from the column. Although the rate of dissociation varied (EDTA yielded rapid elution of the CRD, whereas low pH results in slower elution into more fractions), the results clearly demonstrate that reducing the pH greatly lowers the affinity of the CRD for Man.",

Upon addition of a 14\u2010fold molar excess of GlcNAc2Man3 to a 0.7 mm solution of the CRD, a small number of chemical shift changes were observed as compared with the holo\u2010CRD HSQC spectrum at pH 4.2, and these regions are circled in Fig. 5. However, the number of perturbations was far fewer than observed at pH 6.8 (see Fig. S3 in 19 for comparison). These results suggest that, although binding of GlcNAc2Man3 is not completely abolished at low pH, as is the case for Man3, the affinity is greatly reduced. A third ligand, GlcNAc3, which was not included in our previous study, was investigated here for the first time to determine whether the differences in pH sensitivity could be traced to the GlcNAc moiety of GlcNAc2Man3. First, binding of GlcNAc3 to the CRD was confirmed at near\u2010neutral pH by titrating increasing concentrations of GlcNAc3 (up to 10 mm, 14\u2010fold molar excess) into a 0.7 mm\n15N\u2010labelled CRD sample at pH 6.8. Significant chemical shift perturbations were observed in several regions of the HSQC spectrum, confirming GlcNAc3 binding (see Fig. 7A for perturbation results), and these mapped to regions of the CRD that agree well with our previous results [see Fig. 7B for mapping of significant perturbations onto the crystal structure of the CRD (PDB ID http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=1K9K)]. The chemical shift perturbations were fitted to a single\u2010site binding model (Fig. 7C) as described previously 19, yielding a K\nD of 3.58 \u00b1 0.66 mm. This is approximately double the K\nD of Man\u2010containing glycans measured with the same method, which all ranged from 1.5 mm to 2.2 mm. Figure 5 shows an overlay of the HSQC spectra of the holo\u2010CRD (black) and the CRD after addition of 10 mm GlcNAc3 (blue) at pH 4.2. The size and number of perturbations are very similar to those observed for GlcNAc2Man3. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of Man to the CRD is more sensitive to pH than the binding of GlcNAc moieties; however, binding of all three glycans studied here appears to be significantly impaired at low pH.",

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated that, in the absence of glycan ligands, decreasing the pH of the holo\u2010CRD from 6.8 to 4.2 causes substantial changes throughout the HSQC spectrum (i.e. both chemical shift changes and variable intensity of peaks), suggestive of a structural rearrangement. This structural rearrangement is as yet uncharacterized, mainly because of difficulties arising from variable intensity in these spectra, which we are currently trying to overcome. We suggest that this structural rearrangement could be attributable to the release of bound calcium ions, as it is well known that the CRD has three structurally important bound calcium ions that stabilize the CRD structure and contribute to glycan binding 24. However, our data clearly show that reduction of the pH does not simply generate the apo (Ca2+\u2010free) form of the CRD, but instead produces a new species (see Fig. 8 for a summary of the species observed in this study), which we have tentatively attributed to a \u2018Ca2+\u2010depleted\u2019 form of the CRD. DC\u2010SIGNR, like many C\u2010type lectins, is known to bind a primary Ca2+ with higher affinity than the two secondary calcium ions. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that reducing the pH causes the protein to release the lower\u2010affinity calcium ions, while binding to the higher\u2010affinity, primary Ca2+ may remain. The loss of these secondary calcium ions may explain the reduced/abolished glycan binding. This \u2018Ca2+\u2010depleted\u2019 form of the protein has a conformation and dynamics that are distinct from those of the apo form and holo form at near\u2010neutral pH, and is the predominant species in solution at pH 4.2 in either the presence or the absence of the glycan.",

All three of these ligands have K\nD values in the range of 1.5\u20133.5 mm at pH 6.8, but yield minimal or no chemical shift changes for peaks in the CRD HSQC\u2010spectrum at low pH, even upon titration of a 12\u201314\u2010fold molar excess of ligand (thus preventing any attempts to quantify binding constants at pH 4.2 by using NMR chemical shifts). For example, stepwise titration of excess Man3 into a low\u2010pH (pH 4.2) sample of 15N\u2010labelled DC\u2010SIGNR produced no chemical shift perturbations, indicating that binding of Man3 to the CRD is abolished at low pH. These NMR\u2010based results were largely supported by the successful elution of the CRD from a Man\u2013Sepharose column in pH 4.2 buffer containing no EDTA. This observed reduction in glycan binding at low pH provides the first atomic\u2010resolution evidence supporting the hypothesis that DC\u2010SIGNR has a role as an endocytic receptor 15, 16, like its homologue DC\u2010SIGN. This is consistent with the presence of DC\u2010SIGNR in abundance on the surfaces of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are highly specialized cells that are unusual among vascular endothelial cell types for their high capacity to internalize materials for immunological processing, with proximity to large hepatic repositories of T lymphocytes 25.",

            "text": "In our low\u2010pH glycan\u2013CRD binding studies, we did observe a small number of chemical shift changes upon addition of an excess of GlcNAc\u2010containing glycans (namely GlcNAc2Man3 and GlcNAc3), although these perturbations were not as pronounced as those seen at pH 6.8. These results were in contrast to our observations upon addition of Man3, which did not yield any chemical shift changes, and suggest that the binding of Man to the CRD is more sensitive to pH than binding of GlcNAc moieties. A possible explanation for this difference in binding at low pH between Man and GlcNAc moieties is that there are slight differences in the binding sites of the glycans studied here. Indeed, there are slight differences between the regions of the protein that are significantly perturbed by Man\u2010containing glycans (see Fig. 5 in 19) and those that are perturbed by GlcNAc3 (Fig. 5B). In addition, the crystal structure 1K9J shows that the GlcNAc moiety (and not Man) forms coordination bonds with the primary Ca2+. If we assume that the higher\u2010affinity primary Ca2+ remains bound to DC\u2010SIGNR at low pH, this may explain why GlcNAc binding is not completely abolished at low pH (although it is drastically reduced). Although the differences between DC\u2010SIGNR binding to Man and to GlcNAc at low pH are quite subtle, these results are interesting, given recent work demonstrating that DC\u2010SIGNR serves as an internalization receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF), an important regulator of blood coagulation and a high molecular mass circulating glycoprotein 26. These findings indicate a very important, endogenous role for DC\u2010SIGNR in the removal of senescent glycoproteins from the circulation, most likely via the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, as part of healthy homeostasis. Interestingly, the glycosylation profile of VWF shows a rich variety of GlcNAc\u2010rich N\u2010linked oligosaccharides and a scarcity of high\u2010Man oligosaccharides 27. The complete structural basis for DC\u2010SIGNR binding to VWF is not known, but it would appear likely that engagement of appropriate clusters of GlcNAc\u2010rich glycans would predominate. The observed retention of a small degree of GlcNAc\u2010rich ligand binding at lower pH, in contrast to glycans composed exclusively of Man, may affect the fate of different glycoprotein ligands internalized via DC\u2010SIGNR. Those released earlier at weakly acidic pH may traffic to early endosomes, whereas tighter\u2010binding glycoproteins may traffic to late endosomes/lysosomes for complete degradation. This raises the possibility that DC\u2010SIGNR can serve as a receptor for multiple glycoprotein ligands and also contribute to the determination of their individual intracellular destinations, depending on their specific glycosylation patterns.",

In contrast, addition of EDTA to the holo\u2010CRD (B) produced only Ca2+\u2010bound EDTA peaks, as the free Ca2+ interacts with EDTA. Addition of excess EDTA to the holo\u2010CRD (C) resulted in the appearance of additional free EDTA peaks.",

It is clear from the HSQC spectra that substantial chemical shift perturbations occurred throughout the CRD upon binding of Ca2+ (i.e. upon addition of 4 mm Ca2+). In addition, the spectrum of the apo\u2010CRD is broader than that of the holo\u2010CRD, suggesting a change in dynamics upon Ca2+ binding. Comparison of the HSQC spectra of the apo\u2010CRD at pH 6.8 and the holo\u2010CRD at pH 4.2 indicates that reduction of the pH does not generate the Ca2+\u2010free, apo form, but instead produces an additional, distinct species that may represent a \u2018Ca2+\u2010depleted\u2019 form or multiple species. These two spectra do show a similar pattern of peaks (circled) that we have interpreted to be aliased arginine side chain peaks in very similar chemical environments.

The dashed horizontal line represents the 1 \u00d7 standard deviation cut\u2010off for the dataset, above which a change was considered to be significant. (B) Chemical shift perturbations upon binding of GlcNAc3 mapped onto the CRD crystal structure.
