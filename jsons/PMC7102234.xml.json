            "text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of childhood is a rare and heterogeneous disease. AML accounts for only 20 % of pediatric leukemias and is associated with a worse outcome compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [1]. Due to the rarity of the disease, treatment according to standardized guidelines defined in cooperative treatment protocols and within clinical trials is important to increase cure rates. The treatment strategy for pediatric AML in Austria is conducted in close cooperation with the international Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster (BFM) study center in Germany. Since the early 1990s, a total of 249 patients have been registered in Austria in three consecutive clinical trials (AML-BFM 93, 98, and 2004) [2\u20136]. Each trial was based on the experiences made in the previous BFM studies and on other relevant observations in the field [3, 5, 7]. With further clinical and molecular characterization, subgroups could be identified that either benefitted from intensification of therapy or from reduced dose intensity [3\u20135]. Improved survival over the years is also due to optimization of supportive therapy that helped to reduce deaths from hemorrhage and infectious complications [1, 6]. In this paper, we present data from the three Austrian AML-BFM trials and discuss outcome and management of patients.",

For overall survival (OS), deaths from any cause were considered an event. NR/aplasia, relapse, progression, secondary malignancy (SM), or death were considered an event.

Many patient characteristics at presentation were stable over the three study periods: Median age at diagnosis (9.5 years), age distribution, gender ratio (balanced), and proportion of patients with hyperleukocytosis (15 % of patients had \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/l leukocytes). Diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) involvement seemed to increase by trend (2\u20137 %). The distribution of FAB types as well as the occurrence of classical genetic aberrations was rather similar throughout all studies. Overall, 29 % of patients carried favorable genetic abnormalities (t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16)). All patients in these three trials were also investigated (retrospectively for the earlier period) for MLL rearrangements as part of a large international project [15]. This investigation led to the identification of quite similar numbers across all trials in the range of 23 % (Table 1). Altogether, 37 % of patients were treated in the SR arm and 61 % in the HR arm. Interestingly, risk group distributions did not vary significantly despite some changes of criteria: The extension of HR-criteria in AML-BFM 2004 by FLT3-ITD in non-FAB M3 had just a minor impact due to small case numbers. Of 13 patients positive for FLT3-ITD overall, two were HR by initial criteria, four were shifted to HR by a poor early response, two remained SR because of FAB M3-phenotype, and only five patients were shifted from SR to HR just because of the FLT3-ITD (three of the latter are in continued first CR following HR chemotherapy, whereas two relapsed).",

While the mere proportional relapse rate in the AML-BFM 2004 HR group so far seemed to be stable compared with AML-BFM 98 (24/58, 41 vs. 14/32 %, 44 %), already 7 of 36 patients in the AML-BFM 2004 SR group relapsed mostly around 2 years of observation (i.e., 19 %; AML-BFM-98 2/22, 9 %). Notably, cumulative incidence measures of relapse indicate a more significant difference in relapses between study AML-BFM 98 and 2004 than mere proportional comparisons because several events occurred quite late in the more recent study (around 4 years of observation, so rather close to the median follow-up time).",

In the last study period (AML-BFM 2004), a stable recruitment of approximately 10\u201312 cases annually was reached and most of those (95 %) could be accepted as fulfilling protocol criteria. Hence, results from the different study periods are not completely comparable as the composition of the cohorts changed over time.

Importantly, results improved significantly in trials AML-BFM 98 and 2004 as compared with the 93 study\u2014mostly due to fewer death events beyond 1 year of follow-up in the HR group. To some extent, this reflects not only improvements in therapy including front-line intensifications, but also consistent relapse treatment since the late 1990s and improved SCT procedures [18, 19]. Surprisingly, in comparison with AML-BFM 98, outcome seemed to worsen slightly in AML-BFM 2004 when looking at time-related probability measures, but not so obviously when looking at mere proportions of protocol patients (98 vs. 2004: relapsing 30 vs. 33 %; deceased 26 vs. 27 %). The lower EF and overall survival probability as well as the higher incidence of relapses in study AML-BFM 2004 is mainly caused by a higher relapse rate in the SR group (more events around 2 years of follow-up) and a few late occurring events among HR patients (around 4 years, which is close to the median follow-up of the trial, thus creating significant statistical weight despite low numbers). In detail, 7 of 36 SR-patients of trial AML-BFM 2004 relapsed so far. Five of these would nowadays receive more therapy upfront or not be included into the SR group according to more recent BFM practice and international consensus (one with AML1/ETO; one with STAT5B/RARA, three fulfilling previous SR-criteria only by morphology\u2014Auer rod positive\u2014but not by genetics) [1, 10]. Cases with AML1/ETO fusion have been recognized to fare worse by not receiving HAM in study 2004 that intended only four instead of five cycles for SR patients [10]. Patients with FAB M3 and STAT5B/RARA fusion have recently been demonstrated to be resistant to both ATRA and ATO, and to carry a very poor prognosis with conventional therapy [16]. Generally speaking, of the six PML noninvolving variant rearrangements of RARA identified to date to occur with a low frequency, specifically those involving the PLZF and STAT5B as fusion partners confer therapy resistance and need special management probably even including SCT in first CR [16, 20]. According to the recent pediatric AML expert consensus, mere evidence of Auer rods has no longer been considered an independent criterion for inclusion into a SR stratum in the future [1]. Hence, our relapse case observations among formerly considered \u201cSR\u201d patients demonstrate the increase of knowledge over the study period as well as the fact that the course of single patients can have a considerable statistical influence in small trials. Outcome differences between the small Austrian cohorts and the much larger German patient series, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution: results in the Austrian BFM 98 patients seemed to be better compared with the entire AML-BFM 98 cohort (5-year-pSU 75 \u00b1 6 vs. 65 \u00b1 2 %, 5-year-pEFS 61 \u00b1 7 vs. 51 \u00b1 2 %), whereas this relation inverted in study 2004 (5-year-pSU 62 \u00b1 6 vs. 74 \u00b1 2 %, 5-year-pEFS 50 \u00b1 6 vs. 55 \u00b1 2 %) [17].",

            "text": "One cornerstone of good management of pediatric myeloid leukemia is avoiding nonleukemic deaths and specifically nonrelapse deaths. Major factors of success in this striving are (i) immediate diagnostics and treatment in dedicated and experienced centers only (i.e., limited to five major centers in Austria serving nearly all cases out of a population of approximately 8 million people) and (ii) supportive care aiming at reducing typical comorbidities and fatalities. In fact, the total percentage of study patients who died for any other reasons besides relapse declined over the three studies from 11 % in study 93 to 5 % in trial 2004. In AML-BFM 93 and 98, the respective numbers were comparable with those published for the whole BFM cohort (12 and 9 %, respectively) [21]. Death before start of treatment (n = 6) and early death (n = 3) were almost exclusively caused either by cerebral hemorrhage due to coagulation disturbances as in FAB M3 subtype (n = 2) or to hyperleukocytosis (n = 4; three cases M4/M5), or due to leukostasis with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is typical for FAB M4/M5 subtypes (n = 2). This was also seen in the whole BFM cohort and other international pediatric AML studies [21\u201323]. A high degree of experienced alertness to initial risk of complications, immediate treatment commencement including external cell reduction modalities (e.g., by exchange transfusion) as needed, and specific therapies like ATRA pretreatment in FAB M3 all translate into a reduced death toll [24]. Nevertheless, it needs to be stated that deaths before study consent and treatment initiation are usually not registered in the database of studies that fall under laws and regulations related to the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products. Hence, registration also of such patients and of their presentation (and of other patients not eligible for study inclusion) is an overriding aim for a population-based assessment of the welfare of pediatric patients with AML to work on measures to avert fatal outcome.",

Nevertheless, AML treatment is one of the most intense therapy types delivered in pediatric oncology. It is accompanied by long periods of severe neutropenia and immunosuppression with associated invasive bacterial and fungal infections. Related to this, high-grade toxicity in AML-BFM 2004 was particularly caused by infections (between 22 and 31 % following the different chemotherapy courses; Table 3). The usage of anti-infective prophylaxis covering Pneumocystis jirovecci, common molds like Aspergillus species, and gram-positive as well as -negative bacteria has, therefore, been recommended [1, 22, 23, 25, 26]. Currently, oral antifungal prophylaxis with either itraconazole suspension (higher bioavailability than capsules) or voriconazol is probably the most cost-effective praxis in children with AML. However, rare breakthrough infections with more resistant molds like Zygomycetes (which would be amenable to prophylaxis with posaconazol\u2014not licensed for children) need to be considered. A main cause for gram-positive septicemia in neutropenia especially following cycles containing high-dose cytarabin are viridans group streptococci (VGS), which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to pneumonitis and ARDS [25\u201327]. Antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous vancomycin (or cephalosporins, but not with oral b-lactam antibiotics) at St. Jude\u2019s Childrens\u2019 Hospital strongly reduced the incidence of VGS sepsis and associated morbidity, whereas oral ciprofloxacin effectively reduced gram-negative infections [26]. In a similar approach, we piloted alternate-day high-dose intravenous teicoplanin (plus oral ciprofloxacin for patients aged > 5 years) and found a similar reduction of VGS septicemia (manuscript in preparation). This prophylaxis can easily be applied also in an out-patient setting. Serious viral infections and associated deaths have been rarely reported in pediatric AML patients [22, 23]; however, we observed two cases of death in CR during maintenance therapy caused by fatal EBV-induced hemophagocytosis syndrome.",

In contrast to other international AML studies, high-grade cardiotoxicity is very rare, both in the entire BFM cohort and in the Austrian series, and we faced no death caused by cardiac toxicity [22, 28]. To some extent, this may be due to the use of potentially less cardiotoxic anthracyclines [17], as well as to strategic treatment reductions in good risk patients [4, 10, 29]. Treatment reductions and drug targeting of essential pathways of leukemic pathobiology instead of applying conventional, nonselective chemotherapy may further allow improving cure rates and quality of life. As an example, patients with AML FAB M3 and the typical PML/RARA fusion have an excellent prognosis with current ATRA-based chemotherapy already (20/21 of our patients are in continuous CR-2 following SCT after relapse) [29]. More recent observations with combinations of ATO and ATRA suggest that chemotherapy could even be completely avoided in this subtype [30, 31]. Other types of targeted treatment, e.g., using tyrosine-kinase inhibitors tackling aberrant signaling (e.g., by FLT3-ITD), may be options for increasing survival rates in selected cohorts without further increasing classical chemotherapy toxicity [32].",

Overall, the proportion of patients with poor early response remained at 20\u201324 % throughout the three treatment periods despite stepwise intensification of induction\u2014similar to the whole BFM cohort [17].

Indicating SCT for HR AML by availability of a matched sibling donor\u2014as in study AML-BFM 98\u2014has no proven value overall, but SCT might be beneficial in certain subgroups like those with MLL rearrangements [36]. SCT-related increased morbidity and mortality as compared with conventional intensive chemotherapy needs to be balanced against potentially higher antileukemic efficacy. In that striving for higher cure rates, SCT\u2014in its current forms\u2014is still not a cure-all: despite SCT in first CR, five patients relapsed among 14 transplanted (some of the latter have a very short follow-up time). Nevertheless, our data are in line with the notion that performing SCT in first CR in defined high-risk constellations might allow undergoing SCT under better circumstances and with less toxicity accumulations\u2014in contrast to waiting for a relapse and undergoing further toxic chemotherapies as preparation for eventual SCT in second CR. Importantly, according to our data the proportions of patients eventually transplanted\u2014based on both policies\u2014seem to be similar (37\u201339 % in study 98 and 2004). Upcoming trials will, therefore, reintegrate the idea of transplanting certain high-risk patients already in first CR based on the nowadays more comprehensive picture of genetic aberrations heralding a very poor outcome upon chemotherapy alone [1]. Among those are MLL translocations specifically involving the quite frequently occurring partner genes AF6 (5/5 relapsed; one survived after SCT) and AF10 (6/11 relapsed; short follow-up in two cases after primary SCT), whereas AF9\u2014the most frequently observed translocation partner in pediatric AML\u2014did not confer such very dismal outcome. Our MLL data are in line with recent large-scale case collections, both regarding the very significant overall incidence (23 % among all study patients\u201438 % of HR patients) and with respect to partner gene distribution as well as related outcome [37]. Hence, MLL-rearranged pediatric HR-AML is probably the most important genetically defined subcohort needing improved and individualized treatment modalities. Most importantly, both the need for and the potential of individualized management are based on sophisticated genetic reference diagnostics. In line with this, also improved early response assessment with more objective methodology (e.g., multiparameter flow cytometry) might in the future allow us to individualize treatment better [38].",
