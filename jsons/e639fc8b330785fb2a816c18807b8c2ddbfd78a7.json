Innate immune cells will be the first to respond and will attempt to clear the pathogen through phagocytosis and/or lysis. As pathogens have developed strategies to evade the innate immune response, all vertebrates are capable of eliciting a highly specific response by virtue of their adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system can generate humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (see Fig. 14.1 and Table 14 .3). Antibodies, produced by B-cells, are the typical representatives of humoral immunity. An antibody belongs to one of four different immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE) (cf. Chap. 8). Antibodies are able to prevent infection or disease through several mechanisms: 1. Binding of antibodies covers the pathogen with Fc (constant fragment), the \"rear end\" of immunoglobulins. Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, Antibodies are effective against many, but not all infectious microorganisms. They may have limited value when pathogens occupy intracellular niches (such as intracellular bacteria and parasites), which are not easily reached by antibodies. In this case cell-mediated immunity is required to clear the infected cells. T-cells are the major representative of cell-mediated immunity and can clear infections by the following mechanisms: 1. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs, also called cytotoxic T-cells) react with target cells and kill them by release of cytolytic proteins like perforin. 2.

During an infection the innate immune system instructs those B-and T-cells that have BCRs and TCRs specific for the invading pathogen to proliferate and gain effector functions. When the infection is cleared, most of these B-and T-cells are obsolete and many will die by apoptosis. Antibodies produced by B-cells, however, can persist in the circulation for an extended period of time. Moreover, some of the B-and T-cells resist apop- tosis and can maintain themselves for many years as memory B-and T-cells. In contrast to their naive counterparts, these memory cells are rapidly activated and clonally expanded when they re-encounter the same pathogen on a later occasion.

By continuously endocytosing extracellular material, they sample their environment for potential harmful materials. To distinguish harmful from innocuous substances, APCs are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that allow detection of conserved microbial and viral structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Kawai and Akira 2009 PRR activation induces a maturation program, which switches APCs from an antigen sampling to an antigen presentation mode, which is critical for their role as intermediates for lymphocyte activation. PRR activation induces expression of MHC class I (MHCI) and MHC class II (MHCII) molecules, increasing the APCs' capacity to present antigen to T-cells. Moreover, APCs will gain expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR7) that allow them to migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue.

An important reason for this is that, although the human body harbors a large number of lymphocytes (ca. 10 12 ), only few T-and B-cells will have a TCR or BCR that is specific for the antigen of interest.

Upon subcutaneous or intramuscular administration, the vaccine components are taken up by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in the peripheral tissue and express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have taken up antigens become activated and start migrating towards nearby lymph nodes. Inside the lymph nodes, the antigen processed by the APCs is presented to lymphocytes, which, when recognizing the antigen and receiving the appropriate co-stimulatory signals, become activated. These antigen-specific B-and T-cells clonally expand to produce multiple progenitors recognizing the same antigen. In addition, memory B-and T-cells are formed that provide long-term (sometimes lifelong) protection against infection with the pathogen interact with CD4 + T-helper cells. Endogenous antigens, such as viral or mutated proteins produced by the host cell, are generated by proteasomal processing in the cytosol. The resulting peptides can associate with MHCI in the endoplasmatic reticulum and can interact with (CD8 + ) cytotoxic T-cells ( Fig. 14.1c ). These different antigen presentation pathways have consequences for vaccine design. As T-cells only recognize processed antigen fragments, T-cell responses rely on continuous epitopes, which are linear peptide sequences (usually consisting of up to ten amino acid residues) of the protein (see Fig. 14.1a). In contrast, B-cell epitopes can be discontinuous epi-topes comprising amino acid residues sometimes far apart in the primary sequence, which are brought together through the unique folding of the protein (see Fig. 14.1b). Antibody recognition of B-cell epitopes, whether continuous or discontinuous, is usually dependent on the conformation (=three-dimensional structure) of the antigen. For vaccines aimed to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (for instance, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines), one should take great care that the antigen remains in its native form. Vaccines that should induce CTL responses (e.g., some virus vaccines, cancer vaccines) will not necessarily require the antigen to be in its native form, as the antigen will have to be degraded before presentation anyway. A major challenge for these types of vaccines, however, is that MHCI presentation requires antigen to enter the cytosol rather than the endosomal compartment of an APC (see Fig. 14.1c). Professional APCs, especially DCs, have the capacity to transfer exogenously acquired antigens from the endosomal compartment into the MHCI processing pathway.

This can be done by presenting the antigen in its native format, as is the case for the live-attenuated vaccines, or by formulating the native antigen with adjuvants that stimulate the desired response. Besides immune stimulatory molecules, a vehicle to deliver antigen to antigen presenting cells and B-cells may be crucial, especially for highly purified subunit antigens. Immune stimulatory molecules and delivery systems are called adjuvants. Adjuvants are defined as any material that can increase or modulate the immune response against an antigen. Adjuvants can stimulate the immune system by several, not mutually exclusive mechanisms (Guy 2007) : (1) a depot effect leading to slow antigen release and prolonged antigen presentation, (2) attraction and stimulation of APCs by some local tissue damage and binding to PRRs present on or in APCs, and (3) delivery of the antigen to regional lymph nodes by improved antigen uptake, transport, and presentation by APCs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 510, "end": 536, "text": "(Pulendran and Ahmed 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1554, "text": "(Guy 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u25a0 Formulation Adjuvants: Immune Potentiators and Delivery Systems"}, {"text": "Colloidal aluminum salts (hydroxide, phosphate) are widely used adjuvants in many classical vaccine formulations.

Currently, vaccines are available containing up to six nonrelated antigens: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. Another example is MMR vaccine, alone or in combination with varicella vaccine. Sometimes a vaccine contains antigens from several subtypes of a particular pathogen. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13) is an example.

Even when this condition of matching immunization schedules is met and the components are pharmaceutically compatible, the success of a combination vaccine is not warranted. Vaccine components in combination vaccines may exhibit a different behavior in vivo compared to separate administration of the components.

Chaps. 3 and 5). The use of state-of-the art analytical techniques for the design and release of new vaccines is gaining importance. Currently, animal experiments are needed for quality control of many vaccines but in vitro analytical techniques may eventually (partly) substitute tests in vivo. During the development of the production process of a vaccine component, a combination of suitable assays can be defined. These assays can subsequently be applied during its routine production. Column chromatographic (HPLC) and electrophoretic techniques, such as gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis, provide information about the purity, molecular weight, and other physicochemical properties of antigens. Physicochemical assays comprise mass spectrometry and spectroscopy, including circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Information is obtained mainly about the molecular weight and the conformation of the antigen(s). Immunochemical assays, such as enzymelinked immunoassays, are powerful methods for the quantification of the antigen(s). By using monoclonal antibodies (preferably with the same specificity as those of protective human antibodies) information can be obtained about the conformation and accessibility of the epitope to which the antibodies are directed. Moreover, the use of biosensors makes it possible to measure antigen-antibody interactions momentarily, allowing accurate determination of binding kinetics and affinity constants.

Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have taken up antigens become activated and start migrating towards nearby lymph nodes. Inside the lymph nodes, the antigen processed by the APCs is presented to lymphocytes, which, when recognizing the antigen and receiving the appropriate co-stimulatory signals, become activated.

Mention at least three advantages of mucosal vaccination. What are M cells and why are they important in mucosal vaccination? 7. Mention two or more examples of currently available combination vaccines. Which pharmaceutical and immunological conditions have to be fulfilled when formulating combination vaccines?\u25a0 Answers 1. (a) An adjuvant is a vaccine component improving qualitatively and/or quantitatively the immune response against an antigen. Adjuvants act on the innate immune system. (b) Vaccine 3, because it only contains pure antigen and lacks an innate immune stimulus. Vaccines 1 and 2 consist of complete viruses which in general contain innate immune potentiators, such as double stranded RNA. (c) Vaccine 2 is a live vaccine. Therefore, it can replicate to some extent after administration, increasing the effective dose and extending the contact time with the immune system. (d) Vaccine 2, because it infects cells. Infected cells produce progeny virus. This endogenous antigen source is partially processed and presented in MHC class 1 molecules to Th-cells. This results in induction of CD8 T-cells. 2. Antibodies are able to neutralize pathogens by at least four mechanisms: (a) Fc-mediated phagocytosis (b) Complement activation resulting in cytolytic activity (c) Complement-mediated phagocytosis (d) Competitive binding on sites that are crucial for the biological activity of the antigen 3. Besides antigen presentation through MHCI or MHCII molecules, T-cells require a second signal from an APC before they will proliferate. This second signal supplied by the APC is referred to as co-stimulation and only occurs when the APC has sensed danger, by detecting PAMPs. Therefore, an effective vaccine needs to contain both an antigen and a PAMP (often in the form of an adjuvant). 4. Subunit vaccines are vaccines that contain one or more individual components of a pathogen, e.g., proteins, oligosaccharides or peptide epitopes. These can be either isolated from the pathogen (in case of oligosaccharides, toxins or other protein antigens), recombinantly produced (in case of protein antigens) or synthesized (in case of peptide epitopes). Table 14 .6. An advantage of RNA is that there is no risk of incorporation into host DNA. A disadvantage of RNA is that it is less stable than DNA. 6. Advantages of mucosal vaccination over vaccination by injection are that it: (a) avoids infections caused by needlestick injuries and needle re-use (b) is easier to perform and more vaccinee friendly (c) can induce mucosal immunity M cells are cells present in mucosal surfaces (such as the nasal cavity and the Peyer's patches in the gastrointestinal tract). M cells have little lysosomal degradation capacity, are specialized in the uptake of particulate matter, such as nanoand microparticulate vaccines. They can sample particulate antigens and deliver them to underlying APCs. The density of mucus-producing goblet cells is low in Peyer's patches and M cells do not produce mucus, which facilitates the access of (particulate) antigens to the M cell surface. 7. Examples of combination vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis(\u2212polio) vaccines and measles-mumps-rubella(\u2212varicella) vaccines. Prerequisites for combining vaccine components are: (a) Pharmaceutical compatibility of vaccine components and additives (b) Compatibility of immunization schedules (c) No interference between immune responses to individual components", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2228, "end": 2236, "text": "Table 14", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
