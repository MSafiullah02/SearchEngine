However, these methods have several limitations. Some ISAV strains do not grow and/or produce cytopathic effect (CPE) in CHSE-214 and SHK-1 cells (Kibenge et al., 2000, Kibenge et al., 2001a, Rimstad and Mjaaland, 2002). Joseph et al. (2003) have reported enhanced ISAV infection of macrophage-like (SHK-1 and TO) cells facilitated by ISAV-specific antibodies via Fc-receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting reduced sensitivity of these cell lines for virus typing by neutralization. RT\u2013PCR, VI, and IFAT also vary in their sensitivity and specificity (Optiz et al., 2000, Snow et al., 2003). Although conventional RT\u2013PCR and nested RT\u2013PCR are currently considered the most sensitive methods for ISAV detection (Devold et al., 2000, Kibenge et al., 2000, Kibenge et al., 2001b, Lovdal and Enger, 2002, Mjaaland et al., 1997, Optiz et al., 2000, Rimstad et al., 1999), none of the formats routinely used allow the results to be expressed quantitatively. Thus, there is a clear need for a sensitive and rapid method that could quantitatively detect ISAV in biological samples.",

Canadian ISAV isolates U5575-1, NBISA01, HKS-36, RPC/NB-970-877-2, RPC/NB-980-414-1, RPC/NB-980-280-2, and Scottish isolate 390/98, and Norwegian isolate 835/9/98 were selected for this study. TO cells and CHSE-214 cells were used to propagate the isolates as described previously (Kibenge et al., 2000, Kibenge et al., 2001a). Briefly, TO cell monolayers were grown to about 90% confluency at room temperature (22 \u00b0C) in HMEM (Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium containing Hanks\u2019 salts; BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Wergeland and Jakobsen, 2001), 292 \u03bcg/ml l-glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies), 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma), and 200 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks; for maintenance medium, the FBS was reduced to 5%. For infection, the monolayers were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), inoculated with virus, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow for virus adsorption. Maintenance medium was then added and the flasks were incubated at 16 \u00b0C for up to 10 days or until CPE was complete. The tissue culture virus suspensions were harvested, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to use. For testing ISAV isolate U5575-1 replication in CHSE-214 cells, five flasks were infected and one uninfected flask served used as control. One of the infected flasks was removed from the incubation at time 0 h (i.e. immediately upon adding maintenance medium post-inoculation), and then at 32, 48, 72, 96, 192, and 144 h post-infection (p.i). The flasks were examined for CPE and were then frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. The CHSE-214 cell monolayers were grown at 16 \u00b0C in Hank\u2019s MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B. The monolayers were similarly inoculated with virus as for the TO cells, and were incubated for up to 15 days at 16 \u00b0C. For each ISAV isolate tested for replication in CHSE-214 cells, five flasks were infected and one uninfected flask served as control. One flask was removed from the incubation at time 0 h and then at 72, 120, 192, and 336 h p.i. The flasks were examined for CPE and then were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Virus titration was performed on TO cell monolayers in a 48-well tissue culture plates as previously described (Kibenge et al., 2001a, Kibenge et al., 2001b). The median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was calculated using the procedure described by Reed and Muench (1938).",

The ISAV-negative status of fish was confirmed by attempting virus isolation from tissues of six fish on TO cells and also testing by conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR at the start of the experiment. For the challenge study, 50 Atlantic salmon and 10 rainbow trout fish were removed from the stock holding tanks and anesthetized by immersion in an aerated solution of tricaine methane sulfonate (TMS-222) (100 mg/l). Each fish was then challenged by intraperitoneal injection of ISAV isolate U5575-1 at a dose of 106 TCID50 in 0.2 ml of virus suspension and was then returned to the study tank. Sixty-five uninfected control Atlantic salmon and 55 control rainbow trout were kept in another holding tank in a separate \u201cclean\u201d room. The mortality started 18 days post-ISAV challenge. The fish that survived ISAV challenge up to 76 days were sacrificed and necropsied for evidence of any lesions; their hearts, spleens, trunk kidneys, livers, gills, and pyloric caeca were collected aseptically in separate sterile plastic bags and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for viral analysis by conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR and real-time RT\u2013PCR assays.",

In order to demonstrate this and also prove that the optimized real-time RT\u2013PCR conditions can detect different ISAV isolates, we tested eight ISAV isolates inoculated in CHSE-214 cells and harvested at different hours post-infection. The results are summarized in Table 7\n. ISAV isolate NBISA01 was used as the positive control for virus replication with CPE production in CHSE-214 cells (Kibenge et al., 2000). ISAV isolate U5575-1 served as the negative control for virus replication in CHSE-214 cells as demonstrated above. NBISA01 was the only ISAV isolate that produced CPE in CHSE-214 cells; the CPE was first observed on day 8 post-infection. The melting curve analysis indicated that the real-time RT\u2013PCR products were virus-specific. The results further showed that there was a significant difference (P\u22640.05) among the mean Ct values of genomic RNA levels in CHSE-214 cells at different times post-infection for NBISA01 and HKS-36 suggesting that these two isolates do replicate in the CHSE-214 cell line. The differences among the mean Ct values of genomic RNA levels for ISAV isolates U5575-1, RPC/NB-970-877-2, 390/98, RPC/NB-980-414-1, RPC/NB-980-280-2, and 835/9/98 were not statistically significant (P\u22650.05), implying that these ISAV isolates do not replicate in the CHSE-214 cell line. These observations allowed us to recognize three different CHSE phenotypes of ISAV: replicating cytopathic (e.g. NBISA01), replicating non-cytopathic (e.g. HKS-36), and non-replicating (e.g. U5575-1, RPC/NB-970-877-2, 390/98, RPC/NB-980-414-1, RPC/NB-980-280-2, and 835/9/98).",

Quantitative PCRs (and RT\u2013PCRs) have been available for a long time and are known for their advantages over the conventional PCR (and RT\u2013PCR) assays. The real-time PCR (and RT\u2013PCR) assays have a number of advantages over the conventional PCR (and RT\u2013PCR); they are rapid, sensitive, and capable of displaying the real-time quantitation of the viral load in samples because they do not require post-PCR detection procedures (Mackay et al., 2002). The real-time PCRs are also considered more accurate than the conventional PCR because in the former, the amplification product is measured/detected during the log-linear phase of amplification when the conditions are optimum, whereas in the later, reaction products are analyzed by the gel electrophoresis of end-point products; the amplification of the nucleic acid target especially during the later rounds of amplification may be affected by various factors including reagent limitations, inhibitory PCR by-products, and competition between the DNA strands and primers for the complementary sequences (Mackay et al., 2002); moreover, the end-point quantification of PCR products based on gel electrophoresis may not yield consistent results because measurement of band intensities is very subjective.",

The Ct values (drawn on the x-axis) correlate to the measurements of the fluorescent signal (the y-axis) and provide the quantification of the target template. The melting curve analysis is performed by plotting the loss of fluorescence as the first negative derivative (\u2212d(F1)) against the temperature change (dT) (Jackwood and Sommer, 2002); the resulting peak loss of fluorescence corresponds to the melting temperature (T\nm) of the virus-specific amplicons.",

The assay is more sensitive and has a higher detection limit than the conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR for ISAV. The increased sensitivity of the assay may be due to two possible reasons either in combination or alone: (1) agarose gels have limited dynamic range (Mackay et al., 2002, Niesters, 2001); this is supported by our observation that like the gel electrophoresis of conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR products, the agarose gel analysis of SYBR Green RT\u2013PCR products also shows the virus-specific band only down to a 1:103 dilution (Table 3); and (2) SYBR Green I is more sensitive than ethidium bromide for detecting DNA (Karlsen et al., 1995). Because the SYBR Green RT\u2013PCR assay for ISAV is 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR, it might be useful in detecting sub-clinical ISAV infections in carrier fish, since Atlantic salmon that recover from clinical ISA and are negative by the conventional RT\u2013PCR assay, can still transmit ISAV to healthy Atlantic salmon through cohabitation (McAllister et al., 2003).",

The addition of a short, high temperature incubation step after the elongation step (Table 2) conferred further specificity to the fluorescent signal. The correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.98 and 0.96 for precision within- and between-assays, respectively, suggest a strong linear relationship between viral RNA levels and Ct values. An r\n2 value of 0.962 implies that most of the variation in log concentrations of viral RNA can be explained by the straight-line relationship with Ct values. The high value for the linear regression line and CV values of 2.78 and 6.40% for precision within- and between-runs, respectively, suggest that the assay is highly reproducible. A slope of \u22123.771 indicates an amplification efficiency of 84% for ISAV real-time RT\u2013PCR; this is acceptable considering the fact that the reverse transcription step is not always 100% efficient (Helps et al., 2002).",

Because of the ability of real-time RT\u2013PCR to quantitate the viral RNA, it was possible to differentiate the static viral RNA levels of the residual inocula in the different CHSE-214 cell culture harvests (Table 5; Fig. 3B) from the increasing viral RNA levels associated with replicating virus such as in the ISAV-infected TO cells (Table 4, Fig. 2A). The finding that ISAV isolate NBISA01 is a CHSE-positive phenotype, i.e. it produces CPE, has also been reported previously (Kibenge et al., 2000); similarly, the further finding that viral isolate HKS-36 replicates without causing CPE in CHSE-214 cells is also in agreement with our previous observations (Kibenge et al., 2000). Our data now suggest that the real-time RT\u2013PCR assay may be used to group ISAV isolates into one of three CHSE phenotypes: replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating.",
