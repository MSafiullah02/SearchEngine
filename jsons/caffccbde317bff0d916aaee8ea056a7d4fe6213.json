Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans. Therefore, we aimed to identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations. We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world. Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against pre-specified eligibility criteria. We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques. We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care; from the World Health Organization (n=3), and eight individual countries: USA (n=7), the Netherlands (n=2), Ireland (n=1), United Kingdom (n=3), Switzerland (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), Belgium (n=1). International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care related topics. Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers). There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes. Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made. Key aspects of palliative care, i.e. symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.",

We included publicly available documents concerning COVID-19 that were specifically developed for or included a separate section on nursing homes ('longterm', 'aged', 'post-acute long-term', 'residential' care, 'care homes' or 'care retirement communities'); included advice concerning palliative or end-of-life care, advance care planning (ACP), end-of-life decisions, or critically ill/terminal/end-stage patients; were endorsed by a representative body (i.e. association of healthcare professionals, governments); and written in English, German, French, or Dutch. Eligibility of documents was evaluated independently by JG, LP and LVdB against inclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, decisions were discussed until consensus was reached. Excerpts were extracted by JG applying inductive bottom-up coding of common themes and performing content analysis using NVIVO (QSR) software. Initially coded themes (by JG) were discussed with LP and LVdB, after which a final coding instruction was prepared by JG. Final themes were reviewed and discussed by all authors to reach consensus.",

A matter of urgency is acknowledged in all documents, stating that residents' advance directives/advance care plans should be completed and up to date; in US documents it is added that written physician orders must reflect patients' wishes. Seven documents are more specific to what the advance care plan should at least entail: who is the Lasting Power of Attorney (n=1), whether or not it is desirable to initiate CPR (n=5), admission to the hospital or ICU (n=5), endotracheal intubation (n=2), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (n=3), fluids (n=1), antibiotics (n=1), pharmacological hemodynamic support (n=1), renal replacement therapy (n=1), or comfort care (n=4). Four documents acknowledge that plans may need to be made in emergency situations, with little time available. Six documents highlight the importance of involving representatives/family in goal-setting or ACP. Three documents explicitly state that ACP is a person-centered approach to care, that involves \"effective\" or \"adequate, sympathetic\" communication and a thorough understanding of a person's life, values, priorities and preferences.",

International WHO guidance focused on infection prevention and control, body and funeral arrangements and respiratory symptom management only, while including limited recommendations on palliative care-related topics. Essential aspects of palliative care [6, 28] that were not fully addressed include: holistic symptom assessment and management at the end of life (including stockpiling medications and equipment), staff training (in particular for care assistants who deliver the majority of hands-on care in these settings) regarding communication, decision-making and comfort for dying residents, referral to specialist palliative care or hospice, comprehensive ACP communication (not limited to documentation), support for family including bereavement care, support for staff, and leadership and coordination related to palliative care [6, 8, 27, 28] .",

First, while most documents addressed early physical symptom management in COVID-19, only a few made specific recommendations regarding symptoms at the end of life. Non-physical (psychological, social or spiritual) needs were hardly addressed. Moreover, attention to dementia was limited to 'wandering' residents. This is an important omission given that the majority of nursing home residents have dementia, and the current crisis poses many challenges to them [29, 30] . Several Alzheimer's associations have started drafting COVID-19 guidance specifically for this population [31, 32], and future nursing home guidance should integrate this. Second, many documents highlight that the restriction of visits can be lifted for dying residents (although strict criteria apply) but fail to provide guidance on supporting family, especially regarding bereavement -even though measures, such as physical distancing, might negatively impact the grieving process [33] . Third, although it is remarkable that ACP is mentioned in many documents, it is discussed in a very limited way. The emphasis lies on treatment preferences in writing (i.e. do-not-hospitalize or",
