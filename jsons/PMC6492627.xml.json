Many bat species play keystone roles in ecosystems, where they are essential to pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control (2). Several studies have also highlighted their prominent role as pathogen-reservoirs (3, 4); viruses being the best studied due to their potential as human pathogens (3, 5\u20138). Bats host more viruses per species than rodents, making them an interesting system for both disease ecology and public health research (4, 9).",

Bartonella and other pathogen transmission from bats to humans may occur through religious activities in caves, bat consumption or contact with contaminated products (12, 15). There are documented cases of bat-specific ectoparasites biting humans (16, 17), increasing the potential of bat-born pathogen transmission.

This unique reproductive strategy necessitates milk gland secretion transfer for larval development (26\u201328), which may shape the community of certain bacteria such as Arsenophonus, Bartonella, or Wolbachia by vertical transmission (26, 27, 29, 30).

Although, the transmission route of Bartonella has not been experimentally tested, this bacteria has been detected in a wide range of bat ectoparasites, such as bat flies (44\u201346), tick, and mites (47\u201351). In a recent study, ectoparasite burden was shown to positively correlate with Bartonella infection, suggesting their potential role as vectors (52). Furthermore, Bartonella was detected in bat flies and their host in the Madagascan fruit bat (Eidolon dupreanum), but not in fleas, indicating the potentially crucial role of bat flies in Bartonella transmission (53). Additionally, ectoparasite and virus species richness positively correlate, suggesting a vectorial role of ectoparasites for viruses (54).",

Some species of Bartonella are blood-borne parasites, transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods (104) found in a wide range of mammalian groups and several arthropod ectoparasites (14). For example, Bartonella quintana, a louse-borne parasite, was responsible for trench fever, which affected over one million soldiers during World War 1 (105). The presence of identical Bartonella genotypes in bats and bat flies suggests that bat flies may serve as vectors (44, 53, 80, 81). Host specific bat flies show higher prevalence but lower diversity of Bartonella infection than polyxenous species (46). However, the generally high prevalence and diversity of Bartonella suggests their long co-evolutionary history with bats.",

Polychromophilus species are vectored by nycteribiids (102), and one haemosporidian report is known from a single fossil streblid specimen but observations from extant streblids are still missing (109). Other blood parasites, such as Trypanosoma is transmitted to bats by hemipterans including Cimex species (42). Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans and other mammal species, is transmitted by triatomine bugs (110). Bat flies have not yet been reported as vectors of Trypanosoma species. Nevertheless, Glossina tsetse flies (members of the Hippoboscoidea superfamily along with bat flies) are known to transmit T. brucei. Therefore, it remains possible that bat flies transmit other blood parasites besides Polychromophilus (e.g., trypanosomatids). Additionally, nycteribiids may serve as vectors in the transmission of other protozoans, such as Nycteria spp. (Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae), infecting Afrotropical insectivorous bats; but their vectorial potential has not yet been clarified (107). More work is needed to address these questions.",

It is still unclear whether the ecology and/or the immune system of Miniopteridae species is responsible for such a high parasite diversity compared to other bat families.

The occurrence of Bartonella infection in bats is associated with host diet; hematophagous and carnivorous species are more frequently infected than species with other diets (124). Hematophagous and carnivorous bat species also show higher white-blood cell count, suggesting a higher risk of pathogen exposure, probably due to the fact that these bat species are more exposed to vertebrate specific pathogens (125). Therefore, we might expect a higher microparasite occurrence in bat flies collected from bat species that feed on vertebrates or blood. Nevertheless, there are only a few studies that have focused on microparasites in parasitic bat flies collected from these host species (44, 80, 87).",

It is suspected that they are either parasitic and/or symbiotic of bat flies. In some cases, Wolbachia is considered as a nutritional mutualist, due to its ability to produce vitamin B in certain hematophagous arthropod species, such as Cimex spp. (133). Arsenophonus is a highly diverse group of bacteria found mainly in insects, including bat flies (134\u2013138). Arsenophonus species have been suggested to be primary or secondary symbionts in other taxa (134, 138, 139). Here, we categorize Arsenophonus and Wolbachia as microparasitic organisms in bat flies, since it is unclear how they affect their hosts (35). Furthermore, Wolbachia DNA has been also detected in mammalian blood due to the presence of infected nematodes in host blood (140). It has been observed once in an avian blood system, with the strain being more closely related to the arthropod-associated Wolbachia group (141), and likely having no direct effect on their vertebrate hosts.",

Additionally, we have little knowledge on the microparasites of other bat ectoparasitic groups, such as fleas, bugs, and mites. Future studies should focus on how microparasite and pathogen communities interact on the intra- and interspecific levels. For example, Wolbachia infection is known to inhibit malarial infection in mosquitos (143). Additionally, it is important to understand how bat host traits such as sex, geographical distribution and/or host group size [which are known to shape the distribution of bat fly populations (17, 128, 129)] may affect the occurrence of microparasitic communities in these ectoparasites.
