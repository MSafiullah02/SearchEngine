            "text": "The concentration of progesterone in serum rises after either spontaneous or induced ovulation and it must be present throughout gestation for pregnancy to be maintained. Identification of the source of progesterone secretion in cats differs among studies. In one study, in which pregnant queens were ovariectomized at days 45\u201349 of gestation, none of the queens aborted, suggesting an extra-ovarian source of progesterone [2]. It also has been demonstrated that the enzymes necessary for production of progesterone exist in the feline placenta, suggesting that the feto-placental unit could be a source of gestational progesterone [3]. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated that pregnant queens ovariectomized at day 30 or 45 of gestation exhibited a decline in serum progesterone concentration and subsequently aborted; however, pregnancy was maintained by supplementation of the queens with synthetic progesterone after ovariectomy [4]. Prolactin is considered a luteotropic hormone [5]. Administration of a prolactin-inhibiting drug, cabergoline, in the latter half of gestation caused a decrease in serum progesterone concentration and from 88% to 100% of treated queens subsequently aborted [4], [6], suggesting that corpora lutea are the primary source of progesterone during pregnancy in cats. Knowledge of the source of gestational progesterone alters diagnostic methods used for assessment of pregnancy loss and affects the choice of drugs and regimens to be used for pregnancy termination in cats.",

Superfetation, the simultaneous presence of offspring of greatly differing gestational age in the uterus, never has been definitively demonstrated to occur in domestic cats despite case reports purporting to show kittens of different ages in the uterus of pregnant queens [10], [16], [17]. True superfetation cannot be differentiated from arrested development unless all kittens are normal at term delivery on two or more widely divergent dates. For superfetation to happen, conception must occur after tertiary follicles have been induced to ovulate by copulatory behavior in a pregnant female. Periods of follicular growth do occur during the luteal phase in cats [18] and the ovary can respond to exogenous gonadotropins at mid-gestation [19]. Conversely, it also [is] known that queens may show estrous-like copulatory behavior during pregnancy with no significant elevations in concentrations of estradiol or luteinizing hormone in serum, suggesting that such activity may not be associated with the endocrinology or physiology of fertility [20].",

            "text": "Ectopic pregnancy refers to the extra-uterine development of one or more fetuses. In a primary ectopic pregnancy, development of the zygote through both the embryonic and fetal stages occurs outside of the uterine body. A secondary ectopic pregnancy is defined as continuing development of a fetus in the abdominal cavity after rupture of the uterine wall, which may be associated with a history of trauma. Of the case reports describing ectopic pregnancy in queens, none of them describes the presence of viable kittens outside of the uterus. Instead, most report the occurrence of mummified or macerated fetuses in the abdominal cavity, with or without apparent supporting membranes, at some period of time after routine ovariohysterectomy or parturition [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Most ectopic fetuses are aseptic, although affected cats may be symptomatic. Clinical symptoms include gastrointestinal (vomiting anorexia), urinary (hematuria, pollakiuria, urination outside of the litter box) and such non-specific signs as depression and lethargy. Diagnosis is made by abdominal radiography or ultrasonography. Surgical removal of the fetal tissues and supporting structures is the usual treatment.",

Unilateral torsion is more common, occurring in 93% of cases [27]. Suggested reasons for its occurrence include fetal activity or movement of the queen that causes the uterine horn to rotate around its long axis to produce excessive laxity of the broad ligament [27], [28]. The degree of torsion can vary from 180\u00b0 to 900\u00b0 and less severe clinical signs are associated with a lesser degree of torsion [29]. The clinical presentation includes acute onset of mucoid, serosanguineous or hemorrhagic vulvar discharge; abdominal pain and/or distension; hypothermia; tachycardia and pallor; and dystocia [27], [29], [30]. The condition is diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Diagnosis can be enhanced by color flow Doppler ultrasonography or by exploratory laparotomy. The latter option often is chosen because surgery is the preferred treatment. Detorsion can be attempted if the uterine tissue appears viable, but clinical signs of reperfusion injury must be anticipated. Most often, en bloc ovariohysterectomy is the preferred treatment. In one survey of 14 queens with uterine torsion, three of them died despite prompt surgical intervention [27].",

FCoV is endemic in most multi-cat households, with a sero-prevalence of 75\u2013100% [40]. After initial exposure to FCoV, about 10% of cats develop FIP, 13% become healthy carriers and the remaining 77% become infected, shed virus in feces for several months and then clear the virus, leaving them susceptible to reinfection [41]. Facilities containing queens with high titers for FCoV are more likely to report reproductive failure, abortion and dead fetuses at birth [33]. Because the virus is ubiquitous, preventive management is preferred to test-and-removal or treatment programs. All cats in a facility should be tested every 3\u20136 months and seropositive animals housed separately from sero-negative animals. Only sero-negative animals should be introduced into sero-negative facilities. Seropositive queens should be bred only to seropositive toms and sero-negative queens to sero-negative toms. An on-line registry exists that allows cat breeders to find animals in their breed that match the serologic status in their cattery (http://www.catbreeder.com/). To prevent transmission of FCoV, provide one litter box for every one or two cats; clean litter boxes at least once daily and disinfect them once weekly; keep litter boxes away from food; and, vacuum around litter boxes regularly [41]. Some lines of cats have a genetic predisposition to development of FIP. In one study, the heritability for development of FIP after exposure to FCoV in Persian cats and Birmans cats was 54% and 52%, respectively [42]. Parents and offspring of cats that develop FIP should be removed from the breeding program.",

Underlying causes of spontaneous decreases in luteal function are unknown. It has been demonstrated that secretory products of the uterus do not appear to have an effect on luteal function [49]. Accordingly, cystic endometrial hyperplasia or other sources of uterine inflammation that result in subsequent release of endometrial prostaglandin do not appear to be involved in hypoluteoidism.",
