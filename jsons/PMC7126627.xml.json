It endangers not only people\u2019s health but also the stability of the whole society. In 2003, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) killed 774 people, infected more than 8000 globally and threatened to spread around the world [1], [2]. The A/H1N1 (Hemagglutinin 1, Neuraminidase 1) influenza virus, which caused the 2009 pandemic, continues to circulate in some parts of the world, causing variable levels of disease and outbreaks [3]. By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported from five countries in West Africa-Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone [4]. In the early stages of the emerging infectious disease, it is deficient to recognize the emergence of these infectious systematically and comprehensively, the measures of disinfection and isolation are failed to protect and control infected people, so the patients have little resistance to infection of any kind and emerging infectious spread through the camps like wildfire.",

Meanwhile, various kinds of control strategies have constraints based on the limited medical resources such as doctors, vaccines, drugs, hospital beds, isolation places, medical devices, and so on, especially in rural areas in many developing countries [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The medical resource limitation seriously restricts the prevention and treatment for SARS. At this moment, the department of health or state has to cite the urgency of fighting SARS, adopts green passage policy that speeds for isolation and treatment for SARS, so the doctors have to focus their attentions on the SARS infected cases only. For the patients with common flu, the doctors can only prescribe medicines and advise them to go home for home treatment, which can significantly relieve the pressure of limited medical resources on hospital or doctors.",

This type of control strategy is called as threshold control policy [11], [12], which can be described by Filippov systems [13], [14].

The sliding mode dynamics and the existence of all types equilibria have been discussed. Numerical sliding bifurcation analyses show that the proposed Filippov system has rich sliding bifurcations. The key factors which affect the selective treatment measures and the threshold value of infected cases for emerging infectious disease have been discussed in more detail. Our main results show that reducing the threshold value to an appropriate level could contribute to the efficacy on prevention and treatment of emerging infectious disease, which indicates that the selection pressures can be beneficial to prevent the emerging infectious disease under medical resource limitation.",

According to the sign of the function \u2202F\u2202p2 with respect to I\n1, we address the following interesting results concerning the selection strategies. To show this, we define the threshold value for SARS patients as follows\n(2.5)Ic\u225cc2b2c1\u2212b1c2which decides whether the hospital carries out the selective strategy or not. Thus, there are two cases: \u25a1\nIf I\n1 < Ic, the function\nF\ncan obtain the maximum value at\np1=1,p2=1.\n\u25a1\nIf I\n1 > Ic, the function\nF\ncan obtain the maximum value at\np1=1,p2=0.\n\n",

By using theoretical techniques [26], [27], [31], the existence conditions for sliding segment, sliding mode dynamics and different types of equilibria such as regular equilibrium, pseudo-equilibrium, boundary equilibrium and tangent point have been provided. Further, numerical sliding bifurcation analyses show that the proposed Filippov system has more rich local and global sliding bifurcations than the case studied in Ref. [10], as shown in Figs. 1\u20135 for more details. Especially, the most interesting results are those for the fixed parameter set as the bifurcation parameter varies, the sliding bifurcations occur sequentially: crossing \u2192 buckling \u2192 real/virtual equilibrium \u2192 buckling \u2192 crossing.",
