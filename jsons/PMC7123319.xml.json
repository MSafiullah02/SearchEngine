The incidence of significant pulmonary complications is lower in autologous HSCT recipients than in allogeneic HSCT recipients because of the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and no need for post-HSCT immunosuppression. However, autologous HSCT patients who receive conditioning regimens that include total body irradiation (TBI) are at a higher risk for developing post-HSCT pulmonary complications because TBI is a significant contributor to the development of pulmonary complications post-HSCT. Post-HSCT pulmonary complications can be classified as infectious or noninfectious and follow a predictable timeline after transplantation [2]. Table 21.1 summarizes the most common causes of pulmonary complications based upon the phases of HSCT when they are most prevalent. This table also distinguishes between infectious and noninfectious etiologies.\n",

            "text": "Some pulmonary complications can arise any time during the post-HSCT period, whereas others develop more commonly at discrete time periods. Typically, the post-HSCT course is divided into three phases: (1) pre-engraftment which spans days 0\u201330 post-HSCT, (2) early post-engraftment (days 31\u2013100 post-HSCT), and (3) late post-engraftment (>day 100 post-HSCT). Common pulmonary complications seen in the first 30 days after HSCT (pre-engraftment period) can be of infectious or noninfectious etiologies. The noninfectious etiologies, which include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), engraftment syndrome, pleural effusion, radiation, and chemotherapy-induced lung injury, are caused by the specific agents used in the conditioning/preparative regimen or due to increased inflammation that occurs around the time of engraftment. Infectious causes are due to the profound neutropenic state of the patient and the risk of opportunistic, invasive life-threatening infections. These include bacterial or fungal pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with septic shock, and respiratory viral infections. In contrast, the majority of causes of pulmonary complications in the late post-engraftment phase (>100 days) are related to delayed T- and B-cell immune reconstitution and to active chronic GvHD. Figure 21.1 depicts the time frame in which the above complications most commonly arise.\n",

When feasible, diuretics should be administered following the completion of a blood product transfusion or colloid infusion to enhance diuresis. In addition, patients post-HSCT should be weighed twice daily to monitor their fluid shift. Judicious fluid management should be employed with strict monitoring of all intake and output (\u201cstrict Is and Os\u201d). One should volume restrict the patient and concentrate all IV fluids and medications when feasible. Patients should also have supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation >95%.

Other diagnostic tools include CXR, CT scan of the chest, BAL with or without transbronchial biopsy, and CT-guided needle biopsy. Whenever possible, a biopsy of a suspected lesion should be obtained because the biopsy tissue results may help to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy.

The radiographic findings are nonspecific with diffuse ground-glass appearance bilaterally, airspace consolidation, and pulmonary edema noted on CXR and CT scan of the chest [17].

The severity of disease may be classified as mild (FEV1 measuring >60%), moderate (FEV1 measuring between 40 and 59%), and severe (FEV1 measuring <39%). BAL is a valuable tool in making the diagnosis of BOS. Alternatively, it can be useful to identify or exclude other pulmonary etiologies such as infection (which often contributes to the development of BOS) and help guide further management [31].

Early detection improves overall survival; hence, frequent PFT monitoring in post-HSCT patients is important. It is recommended that PFTs be monitored at least every 3 months for the first year after HSCT and then annually thereafter. If a diagnosis of BOS is rendered, recommended PFT measurements should be performed more frequently in order to monitor the change in the slope of FEV1 volume over time. This measurement dictates further escalation of treatment and/or investigation of other etiologies that may be contributing to declining lung function [31, 33].",

Treatment of CMV infection/reactivation includes ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. Ganciclovir is the first-line treatment in patients who have robust, sustained donor engraftment, and adequate renal function. Ganciclovir acts by inhibiting viral replication. The dosing is 5 mg/kg IV Q 12 h (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-63146-2_28). Patients are transitioned to prophylaxis dosing once CMV viremia resolves because patients who have reactivated CMV are very likely to reactivate again. Foscarnet is typically reserved for use in patients who have limited graft function. The dosing is 60 mg/kg/dose TID for a minimum of 7 days and then changed to maintenance dosing once CMV viremia resolves (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-63146-2_28). Also, foscarnet may be used as prophylaxis during the pre- and early post-engraftment phases for patients who are at very high risk for CMV reactivation (i.e., recipient is seropositive and donor is seronegative). Cidofovir may be used in patients who have CMV that is refractory to ganciclovir or foscarnet. Dosage is either 5 mg/kg/dose once a week or 1 mg/kg/dose three times a week (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-63146-2_28). Because of its known nephrotoxicity, cidofovir needs to be given with probenecid along with pre- and post-hydration in order to aid in preserving renal function. In addition to antiviral agents, CMV hyperimmune globulin (Cytogam) or IVIg should be considered in patients with CMV viremia, as well as those with CMV disease, e.g., pneumonia.\n",
