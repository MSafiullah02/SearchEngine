PD was discontinued at 4 months of age due to recurrent fungal peritonitis. She was able to maintain stable electrolytes with good urine output while off PD. At 2 years of age, she received a deceased donor kidney transplant from an adult donor. Donor kidney was 10 cm in length with a single renal artery and vein. KDPI was 33%. Her height was 80 cm (5th centile), and weight was 12 kg (50th centile) at the time of transplant. It was a five antigen mismatched kidney. Pretransplant hypercoagulable workup was negative. Allograft was placed intra-abdominally. The donor renal artery was anastomosed with the recipient's aorta and the donor renal vein with the recipient's IVC via end-to-side anastomosis, using # 6-0 prolene suture. Bilateral native nephrectomies (right kidney 4 cm and left kidney 4.5 cm in length) were performed at the time of transplant to prevent dehydration episodes post-RT as she was polyuric prior to transplant, and also, it was thought that the 10-cm donor kidney would be little difficult to fit in this small patient.

An early thrombus was found at the renal artery tip for which she underwent thrombectomy, while the kidney was kept cold at back bench. An end-toside re-anastomosis of renal artery with the right common iliac artery was performed using # 6-0 prolene suture. Later, her post-transplant course was complicated by multiple hospital admissions due to viral respiratory illness, UTI, and febrile neutropenia. These episodes were managed with appropriate antibiotics, reduced immunosuppression, G-CSF, and supportive measures. Aspirin was discontinued at 2 months due to development of spontaneous bruising. MMF was held at 2 months post-RT due to severe neutropenia and BK viremia; the latter started at 2 months and peaked at 260 000 copies/mL (ARUP laboratories; normal: <390 copies/mL; quantitative PCR, serum) at 3 months post-RT ( Figure 1 ). for which she underwent end-to-side re-anastomosis after thrombectomy and that could have added further insult to the artery.",

One of the drugs used in the treatment of BK infection, leflunomide, can cause cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis but its association with TRAS is unknown. 35 Endovascular intervention with PTA with or without a baremetal stent is usually the first-line therapy for TRAS. Increased risk of graft loss has been reported regardless of angioplasty or not, 25, 29 but another retrospective study by Geddes et al 36 found no increased risk of graft loss in patients with TRAS who were treated with angioplasty vs those who did not receive angioplasty. Surgical repair is reserved for cases in which angioplasty is unamenable or unsuccessful. 37 Our patient had an excellent outcome with PTA and stent placement alone.",

The clinical course was complicated by diuretic-resistant oliguria and pulmonary edema, eventually requiring HD and mechanical ventilation. HD was discontinued a few days later with improved pulmonary function. However, the refractory hypertension persisted despite multiple antihypertensive agents. She underwent a conventional digital subtraction angiogram which showed a severe anastomotic stenosis (>95% occlusion) of the renal artery (Figure 2) and a preprocedural gradient of 50 mm Hg across the stenosis. Successful PTA with stenting (4 \u00d7 15 mm balloon mounted uncoated stent, Monorail Xience Sierra, Abbott laboratories) of the transplant renal artery was done, with immediate improvement of blood flow and gradient reduction to 18 mm Hg. BPs normalized within few hours with average SBPs of 100-110 mm Hg with intermittent elevation to 120-130 mm Hg.

Leflunomide was discontinued, and MMF was restarted.3 | D ISCUSS I ONBK viremia and nephropathy are increasingly recognized as important causes of renal allograft dysfunction. 2,3 Incidence of BK viremia within the first year post-RT is about 13%-22%, and BKVAN has been reported in up to 10% of kidney transplant biopsies.5,6 Generally, a high serum viral load is suggestive of BKVAN 7 and warrants very close follow-up of renal function. Although our patient had a high serum viral load, we did not initially perform a biopsy due to stable graft function. Performance of a renal biopsy is usually prompted by allograft dysfunction, but some studies suggest persistent BK viruria or viremia as appropriate indications as well.8 On the other hand, a higher rate of false-negative biopsies may be encountered in the early stages of the disease when the parenchymal involvement is patchy.9 Cytopathic changes were not obvious in our biopsy, mostly due to the focal nature of the nephropathy10 and due to significant IF/TA. In patients with renal transplants, ureteric stenosis and BKVAN are known complications of BK infection. However, the presence of BK infection along with TRAS has not been described. The widely accepted pathogenesis of BKVAN is characterized by an ascending infection from the uroepithelial cells to high-level viral replication in renal tubular epithelial cells leading to cellular loss and thereby denudation of the epithelial monolayer in the tubules. Virus then leaks into the tissue and bloodstream, and inflammatory cells infiltrate the interstitium leading to IF/TA. 11 The vascular spread of the virus may lead to the dissemination of virus to other tissues. Historically, polyomaviruses (BK, JC virus, and SV40) are known to infect urorenal epithelial and neural cells. However, subsequent reports have described BK virus to infect and be reactivated in other large number of target cells, including the ones affected by inflammation or ischemia reperfusion injury, predominantly in the immunocompromised host. Some of these other target tissues or organ systems include liver, retina, lung, salivary gland, peripheral blood leukocytes, human umbilical cord vein umbilical cells, pancreatic cells, heart, and skeletal muscle. 12-14 BK virus has also been shown to have tropism for vascular endothelial cells and causes an immune response by upregulating the genes associated with cell proliferation. 15 BK infection also activates the interferon signaling in the endothelial cells by increasing the mRNA levels of many interferon-stimulated genes. 15 Uptake of blood-born BKV virus-like particles by endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and renal vasa-recta has been shown in animal studies. 16 This indicates that endothelial cells might provide an initial immune defense against BKV infection. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that BK virus exhibits a prolonged viral protein expression (at least 2 months), low yield of infectious progeny, and delayed cell death and hence maintaining the antiviral defense in the endothelial cells. 15 This does raise the possibility of role of BK virus in inducing vascular stenosis, especially with prior history of renal artery thrombosis, thrombectomy, re-anastomosis, and possibly vascular injury, as in the case described in this report. Upregulation of cell proliferation genes from BK infection in the endothelial cells could lead to the production of granulation tissue, leading to stenosis of the renal artery. Indeed, ureteric stenosis is one of the known associations with BK infection, usually occurring 2-5 months post-RT, 17 which corresponds to the peak onset of BK virus reactivation in kidney transplant recipients. The most widely accepted theory is that the ureteric epithelium which is damaged by ischemia or inflammation supports the BK infection and then is replaced with a granulation tissue, leading to stenosis. 18,19 We are not able to provide a histological evidence of BK infection of the transplant renal artery due to the very invasive nature of the procedure and potential risks of procedure-related complications. In contrast, infected renal proximal tubular epithelial cells do not elicit an efficient innate immune response against BKV as the infection leads to the release of many progeny virions and loss of cell monolayer viability. 20 Cytopathic effects of BK virus have also been demonstrated in podocytes, mesangial cells, and glomerular endothelial cells, along with the epithelial cells of bladder and urethra. 15 This suggests that these cells do not mount an effective antiviral response, and this may contribute to glomerular inflammation and hemorrhagic cystitis in BKV infection. 21 Due to the strong productive infection, the viral persistence is not maintained in these cells as opposed to the endothelial cells as described above. Hence, there seems to be a cell type-specific response to BKV infection. The simultaneous occurrence of BK nephropathy and TRAS in this patient may be an example of such cell-specific response (death of renal tubular cells and proliferation of renal artery endothelial cells). BK tropism of vascular endothelial cells is well described in a clinical report which described disseminated BK vasculopathy in multiple organs including skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, and esophagus (all histologically proven) in an adult renal transplant recipient leading to death. Renal allograft biopsy showed an immunoreactivity to polyomavirus proteins in capillary endothelial cells and in tubular lumen. The study postulated that BK virus-induced endothelial-cell injury led to capillary leakage and massive edema, along with microthrombotic events causing tissue ischemia in multiple organs. 14 In this report, we describe a child with simultaneous occurrence of BK nephropathy and TRAS, the latter presumably due to spread of BK from renal tubular epithelial cells to the vascular endothelial cells. TRAS is the most common vascular complication after RT. 1 It is a serious but potentially reversible cause of post-transplant hypertension and allograft dysfunction and usually presents 3 placement of vascular clamps during transplant, faulty retrieval or suturing, donor artery atherosclerosis, fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia from prior injury at the time of donation or anastomosis, prior thrombosis, older recipient age, marginal donor kidneys, DGF, prolonged CIT, acute rejection, and CMV infection, mainly in those who seroconvert after transplant. 25-31 CMV-induced vascular damage may occur through local infection and the mitogenic actions of viral gene products within cells of the vessel wall. 32 CMV infectionis also thought to augment endothelial damage.29 CMV-induced direct proliferative effect on vascular endothelial cells leading to TRAS is another possibility.31 EBV-associated post-transplant B-cell lymphoma leading to TRAS secondary to extrinsic compression of the renal artery has been described in an adult patient.33 Our patient did not have CMV or EBV viremia, and there was no extrinsic compression. She did have renal artery thrombus (thought to be secondary to two back-to-back surgeries leading to intravascular volume depletion due to being on NPO status for prolonged time in the setting of polyuria, this was supported by the evidence of ATN in the biopsy)",
