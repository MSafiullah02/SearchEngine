            "text": "The discrepancy between the estimates of R0 and the observed epidemiology might stem from early and effective intervention since Rt, the reproductive ratio of a disease at time t, will decrease with the implementation of successful infection control measures. Yet, even during the three and a half months of SARS spread in China between its initial appearance and the broad implementation of public health measures, case counts were much less than expected from such values of R0 (Xu et al., 2004). By definition, the total number of expected cases of a disease goes up by a factor of R0 for every generation of infection, a generation being the mean time between an individual becoming infected and their infecting others. Based on recorded dates of the first symptoms for 124 pairs of infections in Singapore and Toronto (Leo et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003), we estimate the average generation time (\u03b3) for SARS to be 9.7\u00b10.3 days. (This estimate clearly depends on the accuracy of the reported data.) Roughly, the cumulative number of SARS cases over D days should be \u2211i=0D/\u03b3(R0)i=(1-R0D/\u03b3+1)/(1-R0) (This is capped by total population size and does not consider the reduction in Rt once a substantial proportion of the population is infected). Thus for R0 ranging between 2.2 and 3.6, this equation predicts that in the first 120 days of transmission in China, there should have been between approximately 30,000 and 10 million cases. In fact only 782 cases were reported during the initial three months (World Health Organization, 2003), which, using this simple calculation, suggests that R0 should be much lower and closer to 1.6. A subsequent estimate based on data from the Hong Kong and Singapore outbreaks brings R0 down to 1.2, which, by the above formula, predicts approximately 50 cases during the first 120 days of transmission (Chowell et al., 2003). While this number agrees nicely with the case counts observed in Hong Kong and Singapore (Chowell and Fenimore, 2003a, Chowell and Hyman, 2003b) it is an order of magnitude lower than that reported for China.",

            "text": "Why do epidemiologists derive such varied estimates of R0 and why were the initial estimates so high in comparison to the observed epidemiology in China? The basic premise of fully mixed epidemiological models\u2014that all individuals in a group are equally likely to become infected (or infect others)\u2014often does not hold and therefore may lead to spurious estimates or estimates that cannot justifiably be extrapolated from the specific setting in which they were measured to the broader community context. Early SARS estimates were based largely on transmission data from closed settings like hospitals and crowded apartment buildings, where there are unusually high rates of contact between individuals (Lipsitch, 2003; Riley et al., 2003). In fact, hospital transmission accounts for 50% of the value of R0 described in Riley et al. (2003). If the contact patterns in these settings were highly heterogeneous, then the estimates for R0 may be inaccurate. Even if the estimates for R0 were indeed appropriate for these specific settings, they probably should not be extrapolated to the population at large. Contact rates may be considerably lower outside hospitals and crowded apartment buildings and thus so may be the general value of R0 for SARS (Yu et al., 2004). Such disparity may account for the discrepancy between the estimates and the slower progress of the outbreak in China. In fact, further studies suggest that the unusually large cluster of infected cases in Amoy Gardens complex in Hong Kong was due to exposure to the virus-laden aerosol plume originating from one of the buildings in that area and not from direct person-to-person contact (Yu et al., 2004). A recent analysis of the impact of SARS isolation interventions in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto emphasizes the importance of viewing R0 as a distribution of possible values where the mean and median may vary depending on the setting in which the disease is spreading (Chowell et al., 2004).",

For example, the strategies for international SARS control were founded upon the largely intuitive idea of early interruption of critical social contacts (World Health Organization, 2003). There are several mathematical approaches that likewise consider sociological factors. To name a few, compartmental models that break populations into many demographic groups capture greater behavioral heterogeneity (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984); stochastic approaches including stochastic compartmental models (Bailey, 1975), branching process models (Becker, 1977; Farrington et al., 2003), dyad models (Keeling et al., 1997; Ferguson and Garnett, 2000), and Reed-Frost chain-binomial models (Lefevre and Picard, 1989) allow more exact predictions of the size and probability of epidemics; and \u201cindividual-based modeling\u201d, a primarily computational approach based on following the contact and infection histories of simulated individuals, yields detailed statistical predictions about disease outcomes. Most individual-based models assume pre-defined simple contact patterns such as regular lattices (Durrett, 1999; Kleczkowski and Grenfell, 1999; Ritton and O\u2019neill, 2002; Sander et al., 2002), although there have been recent efforts to consider more realistic contact patterns (Van der Ploeg et al., 1998; Chowell and Fenimore, 2003a, Chowell and Hyman, 2003b; Eubank et al., 2004).",

The first step in contact network epidemiology is to construct networks based on information about real-life contacts between individuals. One can then analyse these networks to determine their crucial topological features and apply analytical methods to make epidemiological predictions and intervention recommendations. The two primary advantages of this approach are that (i) it makes no a priori assumptions about the global network structure and (ii) the mathematical analysis allows one to bypass extensive simulation.",

We refer to the first individual in a community to come down with an infectious disease as patient zero. The probability that a patient zero with degree k will start an epidemic, \u03b5k, is equal to the probability that transmission of the disease along at least one of the edges emanating from the original vertex will lead to an epidemic. For any one of its k edges, 1-T is the probability that the disease does not get transmitted along the edge and Tu is the probability that even if disease is transmitted to the next vertex, it does not proceed into a full-blown epidemic. Thus \u03b5k=1-(1-T+Tu)k.The probability that an outbreak of size N will ignite an epidemic is 1-\u220fi=1N(1-\u03b5ki) where ki is the degree of individual i. This is just one minus the probability that none of the N infected individuals sparks an epidemic. If we know the number of current cases but not their contact patterns, then our best estimate for the probability of an epidemic is calculated similarly, with each of the (1-\u03b5ki)'s replaced with the probability that a typical infected individual does not spark an epidemic. The number of edges through which a typical infected individual can start an epidemic is given by the excess degree pgf, and the probability that one of those edges will not give rise to an epidemic is 1-T+Tu. Thus the probability that none of those edges will be a conduit to an epidemic is (\u2211k=1\u221ekpk(1-T+Tu)k-1\u2211k=1\u221ekpk),and the probability that an outbreak of size N sparks an epidemic is1-(\u2211k=1\u221ekpk(1-T+Tu)k-1\u2211k=1\u221ekpk)N.Finally, we derive an individual's risk of infection during an epidemic as a function of his or her degree. The probability \u03bdk that an individual with degree k will become infected during an epidemic is equal to one minus the probability that none of his or her k contacts will transmit the disease to him or her. The probability that a contact does not transmit the disease is equal to the probability that the contact was infected, but did not transmit the disease, (1\u2212u)(1\u2212T), plus the probability that the contact was not infected in the first place, u.

When S is well below one and R\n0 is well above one, it is very likely that communities with similar contact patterns will have diverse experiences with the disease, some experiencing large epidemics and other experiencing only minor outbreaks. In particular, above the epidemic threshold, the probability of an epidemic in the power law network and the probability of an epidemic in either of the other networks diverge quickly.

Because superspreaders are rare, however, any particular outbreak may fail to reach this minority and thus never generate an epidemic. In contrast, vertices in a Poisson network will be fairly homogeneous and any two small outbreaks will be essentially equivalent. Whereas a power law network reaches an epidemic threshold only when transmissibility is sufficiently high to reach superspreaders with reasonable frequency, a Poisson network reaches an epidemic threshold only when the \u2018typical\u2019 outbreak leads to an epidemic.

To leading order, these two probabilities are equal. The efficacy of these strategies increases with the magnitude of the intervention a, decreases with the degree of the individual, and depends on the nature of the underlying contact network (Fig. 5\n). Near the epidemic threshold, individuals of different degree benefit equally from such strategies. Well above the epidemic threshold, the more limited one's contacts, the greater the impact of such interventions.

Furthermore, individuals may easily reduce their social interactions by avoiding crowded shopping malls and movie theaters, whereas hospital caregivers may be unable to reduce the number of patients with whom they interact.

Health care workers are more at risk than school children, other working adults, and non-working adults. A typical non-working adult cuts his risk of infection by approximately 33% when he or she eliminates half of previous contacts, whereas a health care worker cuts his or her risk by only 17%.

Patient zero in Toronto (onset February 25, 2003) was the matriarch of an extended, multi-generational family who died at home on March 5 as an unrecognized case of SARS (Poutanen et al., 2003). In addition to the five of ten persons within her family cluster who were affected, subsequent spread to health care workers, patients and their families culminated in more than 200 probable cases in Toronto, most of them indigenously acquired (Health Canada, 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003). In contrast, patient zero in Vancouver (onset February 26, 2003) returned from traveling with his wife to an otherwise empty abode on March 7, 2003 and was almost immediately hospitalized (Poutanen et al., 2003). Two of the three other probable cases in Vancouver were imported from abroad and no secondary case of SARS from patient zero was detected (Health Canada, 2003). Fig. 4A illustrates that, in our simulated urban network, the difference between a patient zero with one to five contacts (Vancouver) and a patient zero with ten or more contacts (Toronto) can mean a doubling or tripling in the likelihood of an epidemic.",

Realistic contact networks also allow detailed quantitative assessments of intervention strategies. A caveat to this approach is the static nature of our models. While our calculations capture the temporal progression of a disease through a population, we assume that the underlying contact patterns are fixed throughout an outbreak, a reasonable assumption if public health control measures are implemented early and consistently. While one can easily consider temporally changing interventions through epidemiological simulation, we have not yet developed analytic methods to predict the impact of such dynamics.",

It is relatively straightforward to derive based on routinely collected epidemiologic data and can be predictive in homogeneous settings; it also has historically informed effective vaccination strategies (Anderson and May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000). Yet R\n0 has its limits. Since R\n0 is a function of both the transmissibility of a disease and the contact patterns that underlie transmission, then measuring R\n0 in a location where contact rates are unusually high will lead to an estimate that is not appropriate for the larger community. As in the case of SARS, however, data is often only available for a limited and unrepresentative sample of the larger population.",

This means reporting not just the number of new infections per case, but also the total estimated number of contacts during the infectious period of that case. Given the primary role of contact tracing in infectious disease control, the relevant data is often collected. As an alternative to such direct estimates of T, if the underlying contact network is known, one can estimate T based on epidemiological case counts. We can predict the expected number of cases at each generation of transmission as a function T (not described here) and thus estimate T by curve fitting to the appropriate data (Meyers et al., 2003). The sensitivity of our epidemiological predictions to the estimated value of T will vary by both contact network and disease (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). For example, for highly contagious diseases (T>0.2), the probability of a large-scale epidemic is much more sensitive to minor variations in T in the power law network than in the Poisson and urban networks (Fig. 3). The reverse is true for mildly contagious diseases just above the epidemic threshold.",

We offer a simple example to illustrate the benefits of measuring T. Suppose we measure R0=2.7 in a hospital where the average individual comes in close contact with 100 other individuals. Then the probability that an individual will catch the disease from an infected contact is just 2.7% or, in network terms, T=0.027. Now suppose the typical individual in the general population has 10 close contacts that could potentially lead to the spread of a disease. If we extrapolate R0=2.7 to the general public, then we predict that, on average, 2.7 out of every 10 contacts or 27% of contacts become infected, whereas if we extrapolate T=0.027 to the general public we still have only 2.7% of contacts becoming infected, which gives us a much reduced expectation for the spread of the disease.",

To truly reap these benefits of the network epidemiology, we must have not only good estimates of T but also realistic models of contact networks. We have presented a first step towards a realistic community network and have shown that it departs significantly from the idealized networks previously used in network epidemiology, and yet still is sufficiently random for the application of epidemiological network analysis. The task of making even more realistic contact network models of small communities, hospitals, cities, even the global the population is enormous, but promises a step change in our ability to predict and effectively control the spread of infectious disease. As we incorporate better data at these various scales, network theory will allow us to generalize our predictions and make better suggestions for epidemiological control.",
