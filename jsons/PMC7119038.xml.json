During the Spanish Flu pandemic, mortality was significantly higher in underdeveloped countries than in developed countries.2, 6\n",

The severity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 remains largely unknown, due in part to the fact that the situation is still evolving, and it may increase when more vulnerable populations are affected. Conducting the severity assessment is also constrained by limited data, such as accurate estimates of case-fatality rates. WHO has issued guidelines for assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic.7 However, this is only a conceptual framework and does not provide detailed methods for the assessment. The WHO framework comprises three variables, including the virological and epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, the vulnerability of a population and the capacity for response.",

Massive external technical and financial support has been provided to ASEAN countries, especially those that have been severely affected by H5N1, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR. In addition, because this region was an epicentre of recently emerging diseases, WHO developed guidelines in 2005 entitled \u2018Asian Pacific Strategy on Emerging Infectious Disease\u2019 (APSED) to strengthen the general capacity to respond to emerging diseases, including pandemic influenza. This strategic framework has helped countries in the Asian-Pacific region to strengthen their communicable disease surveillance and response capacities, including the capacity to respond to pandemic influenza. Under APSED, each country now has a better capability and capacity to respond to emerging diseases. However, in spite of all these efforts in recent years, there are certain critical gaps in the capacity to respond to a major public health threat, such as pandemic influenza. In recent years, the general response capacity at central level has improved significantly, while that at local level remains suboptimal. Other emerging disease threats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and H5N1, have caused focal outbreaks in which some support could be provided from central level. Since pandemic influenza affects virtually all areas in each country with a minimum time lag, support from central level may not be provided during a pandemic.",

Although the majority of people infected by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have self-limiting infections, some have developed very severe forms of illness, such as severe viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Preliminary data indicated that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases required care in an intensive care unit.9 In order to prevent such severe cases, early treatment is crucial. In Mexico, it has been suggested that late treatment was associated with a higher fatality rate.10 The lack of healthcare facilities and personnel in several South-east Asian countries could be a limiting factor for early treatment. Table 1\nsummarizes the overall hospital bed capacity and available medical personnel in each country. Several South-east Asian countries do not have adequate surge capacity to care for a large number of patients. The lack of resources for fundamental health care is certainly problematic in terms of providing early treatment to cases. It has also been shown that there are other gaps related to providing adequate medical care; these have come to light from community surveys of health-seeking behaviours.11, 12, 13, 14 The socio-economic level and a lack of knowledge regarding severe signs of illness were associated with the health-seeking behaviours for children with pneumonia.",

The current stockpiled levels of antivirals are not adequate to cover a large number of patients. In some areas, the small stocks of antivirals have already been depleted during the early stage of the pandemic. Another critical element of the healthcare system's capacity to mitigate the impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is its capacity to treat very severe cases. In Spain, approximately 75% of patients in intensive care units due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have survived.15 However, unless proper intensive care facilities with adequate equipment, such as mechanical ventilators, are provided, many of the severe cases, especially primary viral pneumonia cases, may be fatal. Several hospitals in the rural areas of South-east Asia do not have the capacity to provide intensive care, primarily due to the lack of equipment and trained medical personnel. The mortality impact can be higher in areas with limited intensive care facilities.",

This illustrated differences in age distribution between populations for seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza. For pandemic (H1N1) 2009, the mortality impact by age group is similar to the previous pandemics. As reported in some studies,21, 22 high mortality rates were observed for those aged between 40 and 59 years. The mortality impact among elderly people appears to be lower, possibly because they already have some level of antibody protection against pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which has been shown by a seroepidemiological study.23 Thus, the younger population has been experiencing a higher impact due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009.",

The highest number of fatal cases was reported in Thailand (n\n = 153), followed by Malaysia (n\n = 76) and the Philippines (n\n = 28). The number of fatal cases is still considered small in other South-east Asian countries. In fact, Thailand and Malaysia have better response capacities than countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar. However, the situation in South-east Asia is still evolving and the severity pattern in each country may change over time. It has been assumed that approximately 20\u201330% of the total population may be ill during the first season of this pandemic. Such large outbreaks are yet to occur in most of the South-east Asian countries. Some epidemiological reports have indicated the significance of school-related outbreaks that can trigger outbreaks in the wider community.24, 25, 26 Therefore, this study attempted to conceptualize the evolving severity patterns as a step-wise spread (Table 3\n).",

Once pandemic (H1N1) virus has spread widely in the community, those individuals with certain risk factors could be affected and the number of severe cases can be assumed to increase. When the virus reaches the most vulnerable populations, the impact of this pandemic could be much greater. Therefore, it is important to monitor the situation closely and urgently improve the preparedness and response capacities in all areas.",

This analysis included several indicators that may potentially lead to larger negative impacts, including the overall population structure, populations at increased risk, and hospital capacity and health professional resources. Many areas of South-east Asia have not yet experienced a widespread community transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. It is important for each country in South-east Asia to develop the best strategy possible to mitigate the impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the community using the resources available. These mitigation strategies should include health educational activities for the public and improving response capacities in healthcare systems.",
