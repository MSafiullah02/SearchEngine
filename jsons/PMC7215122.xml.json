A recent study took biopsy samples from the lung, liver, and heart tissue of a patient who died of COVID-19 [15]. The pathological findings of the lung showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (mainly lymphocytes). The biopsy specimens of the liver showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggesting the injury maybe induced by novel coronavirus or drugs. No obvious histological changes were seen in the heart specimens, suggesting coronavirus infection may not directly damage the heart. Although we already knew the pathological changes of multiple organs in a critically ill patient with COVID-19, little is known about the potential association between the temporal dynamic changes of the lung and other organs. The aim of this study, therefore, was to quantify the severity of lung involvement on chest CT and to determine the relationship between lung severity and laboratory parameters of infection and organ function in different disease stages, which might benefit patient care.",

In the progressive stage, extensive GGO with consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and traction bronchiectasis was often observed (Fig. 1b). In a small proportion of cases, pleural effusion and cavitation could be seen. In the peak stage, the diffuse GGO further extended to peak, with consolidation becoming denser (Fig. 1c). In the absorption stage, the consolidation was gradually absorbed with residual parenchymal bands (Fig. 1d). Few cases presented crazy-paving pattern.

Neutrophilia is one of the hallmarks of acute infection. Neutrophils are recruited early to sites of infection where they kill pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) by oxidative burst and phagocytosis [18]. Some literature supported the hypothesis that a little known yet powerful function of neutrophils\u2014the ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps\u2014may contribute to organ damage and death in COVID-19 [19]. Previous studies showed neutrophil count was notably related to disease severity [20, 21]. Neutrophil infiltration was noted in two recent reports on the pathological findings from autopsied COVID-19 patients [22, 23]. In the progressive stage, infection-related biomarkers included neutrophil count, WBC, CRP, and procalcitonin elevated. Pathological findings showed diffuse alveolar damage with inflammatory cell infiltration in this stage. Accordingly, chest CT showed diffuse GGO with consolidation. Patients with severe virus infection are more likely to be co-infected with bacteria due to low immune functions [24]. Cytokine storm in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19 might be associated with the activity of these infection-related biomarkers regulated by inflammatory cytokine.",

The changes of CT images might lag behind the changes of laboratory parameters. In the absorption stage, the laboratory parameters did not correlate with CT scores, which might be due to the mismatch between CT scores and inflammatory clearance. The CT scores in the absorption stage were not significantly reduced compared with those in progressive stage because consolidation generally dissipated into GGO and extensive GGO was noted after consolidation absorption. Another explanation might be the changes of chest CT lagged behind the changes of laboratory indexes.",
