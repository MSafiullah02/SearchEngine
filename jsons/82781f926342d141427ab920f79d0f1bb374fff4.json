            "text": "Experimental and computational studies provide compelling evidence that neuronal systems are characterized by power-law distributions of neuronal avalanche sizes. This fact is interpreted as an indication that these systems are operating near criticality, and, in turn, typical properties of critical dynamical processes, such as optimal information transmission and stability, are attributed to neuronal systems. The purpose of this Rapid Communication is to show that the presence of power-law distributions for the size of neuronal avalanches is not a sufficient condition for the system to operate near criticality. Specifically, we consider a simplistic model of neuronal dynamics on networks and show that the degree distribution of the underlying neuronal network may trigger power-law distributions for neuronal avalanches even when the system is not in its critical regime. To certify and explain our findings we develop an analytical approach based on percolation theory and branching processes techniques.",

            "text": "In neural systems, power-law distribution of avalanche sizes and durations (lifetimes) have been observed both in experiments [1, 4, 8] and computational models [17] [18] [19] . To validate that power-law distributions are indeed due to criticality, one needs to perform other tests [4] , including testing finite-size scaling relations [4, 20] and performing collapse of temporal profiles [4, 20, 21] . However, these techniques cannot determine what mechanisms or conditions keep or pose the system in the critical regime or if/how the system may lose its criticality. Nevertheless, other approaches can be used to demonstrate mechanisms or conditions that can lead to criticality of biological systems [22] or mechanisms (especially in living systems) other than criticality that can lead to power-law distributions [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In particular, Friedman and Landsberg [22] considered a simplistic model for neuronal dynamics and introduced a mechanism through which the hierarchical structure of neuronal networks can generate powerlaw distributions even far from criticality. The importance of network structure underlying neuronal dynamics for the * afaqeeh@iu.edu generation of power laws has been also reported in other studies [18, 19] .",

To do so, we consider a simplified model of neural dynamics on networks, and show that, for some scale-free networks, avalanche sizes obey power-law distributions even in subcritical dynamical regime. Moreover, in other cases in which the avalanche size distribution is a power law with exponential cut-off, we disclose what structural parameters determine the cut-off size and show that even in such cases it is possible to observe distributions that are approximately power law over several orders of magnitude. In addition to numerical evidence, we provide an analytical description of the phenomenon relying on techniques borrowed from the theory of percolation [30] and branching processes [31] [32] [33] . We believe that our findings may have important implications in understanding properties of dynamics on realworld networks that have heavy-tailed degree distributions [2, 5, [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

In our model, an avalanche starts with a single activated neuron and, at each time step, every one of the active neurons fires a signal that stimulates all of their neighbors. This stimulus activates with a probability p each neighbor that has not been already activated. The avalanche of activities continues until no new neuron can be activated. This model is identical to the so-called independent cascade model, often considered in the context of opinion spreading in social networks [38] [39] [40] . For neural dynamics, it is a more realistic version of the Friedman-Landsberg model (FLM) [22] as in our model each time a neuron receives a stimulus it has the chance to become activated while in the FLM the activation does not depend on the number of stimulations. In spite of its simplicity, our model captures the fast timescale behavior of integrate-and-fire models [41, 42] . This fact follows from the simplifying assumptions that repetitive activation is neglected and the stimulations that activate a neuron (by increasing its potential to above its firing threshold) are set at random [19, 22, 43, 44] .",

According to the asymptotic properties of generating functions [48, 54, 55] , the first form gives a \u03c0 s with a power-law tail and the second form results in a power law with exponential decay. In particular, for \u03bb > 3 and nonscale-free networks, \u03c0 s = R 1 s \u22123/2 at the critical point (p c ) and \u03c0 s = R 1 s \u22123/2 e \u2212s/s * in the noncritical phases; however, for 2 < \u03bb < 3, \u03c0 s = R 2 s \u2212[1+1/( \u03bb\u22121)] at p c (see Supplemental Material [48] for the definitions obtained for R 1 and R 2 [59] ). For these cases, Refs. [51, 52] reported the same results for the functional form of \u03c0 s ; however, the equations they used [instead of Eqs. (3) and (4)] underestimate the prefactors [48] . We also retrieve the result s * \u221d \u03b4 \u22122 calculated previously for UNs (using another method [51] ) and we discover that a similar relation also holds for DNs; furthermore, we find that the exponential decay factor s * is also controlled by the skewness of the degree distribution according to s * \u2248 2p 2 k k 3 \u03b4 2 k 2 2 for UNs and s * \u2248 2p 2 k jk 2 \u03b4 2 jk 2 for DNs. This indicates that even for skewed non-scale-free networks it is possible that a power-law distribution of avalanche sizes, expanded for several orders of magnitudes (i.e., as long as s s * ), emerges. On the other hand, despite the expectations of Refs. [51, 52] , at the subcritical regime of 2 < \u03bb < 3, we get pure power-law distribution in the form",

To obtain this result we assumed that the solution of Eq. (7) for 2 < \u03bb < 3 has the form \u03c6 \u223c a 1 w \u03b1 1 + a 2 w \u03b1 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , where \u03b1 1 < \u03b1 2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , and used the dominant balance method [33, 44, 60] to obtain the correct form for the leading order terms [48] . As demonstrated by Eq. (9), the exponent of this distribution in UDNs is \u03bb = \u03bb = \u03bb o , and in CDNs and UNs is \u03bb; in CDNs the leading order term can be corrected with a \u03bb order term if the difference between the exponents \u03bb and \u03bb is considerably small. Figure 1 shows that our predictions for the subcritical and critical regimes of 2 < \u03bb < 3 capture very well the powerlaw behaviors of the tail of \u03c0 s . In the procedure for deriving Eq. (9) we made no assumption about the sign of \u03b4; however, we immediately notice that Eq. (9) is only valid for the subcritical regime since in the supercritical regime (that \u03b4 > 0) the prefactor and hence the probability \u03c0 s will not be a real non-negative value. In with the same maximum s as that of the numerical data. The nearly vertical cut-offs in s are caused by the cumulative sum on data with finite maximum s and not by the shape of \u03c0 s . In each panel, the numerical results for lower p values are those located at lower positions. The networks are constructed using our extension of the configuration model [48] . the next section, we show that a set of equations other than Eqs. (5) and (6) and a modified method should be used to obtain valid results for the supercritical regime of 2 < \u03bb < 3.",

            "text": "In summary, we have provided analytical proofs, accompanied by numerical confirmations, that even in a simplified description of neuronal dynamics, because of structural heterogeneity, different types of critical and noncritical powerlaw avalanches with different exponents can be observed. This finding may help us to better explain the emergence of power-law neuronal avalanches with exponents different from 3/2 observed in experiments [64, 65] and in realistic computational simulations [19] . Moreover, critical systems are known to have crucial advantages such as optimum information transmission, capacity, and stability [1, 13, [15] [16] [17] because of their power-law avalanches. Thus the existence of power laws in other dynamical regimes implies that some noncritical systems may benefit from similar advantages due to divergence of the mean values and scale invariance of their power-law distributions [13] . Furthermore, the emergence of such noncritical power laws introduces new challenges for accurate detection of criticality in experimental setups due to the finite size of the commonly used samples. In addition to the importance of these findings in the context of neuronal systems, the insights on percolation properties of networks that this Rapid Communication provides may find applications in topics such as network robustness [56, 66] , epidemic spreading [50, 67, 68] , and stability of biological systems [69] .",
