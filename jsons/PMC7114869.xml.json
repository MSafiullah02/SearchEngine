            "text": "Bats are considered the natural reservoirs of several emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as Nipah virus, Marburg virus, rabies virus and coronaviruses, that have caused outbreaks in both humans and animals (Shi, 2013; Smith and Wang, 2013). The ecological features of bats, including their ability to fly long distances, their longevity, their large social colonies and their potential interactions with humans or livestock animals, facilitate virus maintenance and transmission, increasing the risk of intraspecies or interspecies jumping (Calisher et al., 2006). Among bat viruses, in the last decade, a large diversity of coronaviruses has been detected, exceeding the diversity seen in other mammalian hosts (Drexler et al., 2014). Coronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) are enveloped viruses characterized by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 26\u201332 kilobases and classified into four genera (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). Alphacoronavirus (Alpha-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (Beta-CoV) infect several mammal species, including humans, bats and pigs, while Gammacoronavirus (Gamma-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (Delta-CoV) infect birds, wild felines, pigs and some marine mammal species (Woo et al., 2009b, 2012). The genome of coronaviruses is characterized by high frequency recombination and a high mutation rate, which increases their potential for interspecies and intraspecies jumping (Lai, 1992; Holmes, 2009). Six CoV strains are recognized to infect humans. Two Alphacoronaviruses (HuCov-229E, -NL63) and two Betacoronaviruses (HuCoV\u2212OC43, -HKU1) are responsible for the common cold and severe respiratory pathologies in infants, elderly people and immunocompromised patients and are characterized by human-to-human transmission (Hu et al., 2015). The other two Betacoronaviruses species, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV in 2002\u20132003) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV in 2012) caused severe respiratory pathologies with case fatality rates of 9% and 35%, respectively (WHO, www.who.int). Phylogenetic analysis on strains detected in bats, humans and other mammals suggested that the origin of these CoVs was in bats. The Rhinolophus bat species are considered the main reservoir for SARS-related CoVs. Bat MERS-related CoVs were also detected in African, Chinese and Italian bats (Annan et al., 2013; Ithete et al., 2013; Lau et al., 2013; Corman et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2017), supporting the hypothesis of the bat origin. In three recent studies, related strains of the HuCoV-229E were detected in Hipposideros bats and strains of HuCoV-NL63 were detected in the American tricoloured bat (Perimyotis subflavus) and Kenyan Triaenops afer species, suggesting bats as potential reservoir host of Alphacoronavirus human strains (Pfefferle et al., 2009; Huynh et al., 2012; Corman et al., 2015). In addition, relatives of HuCoV-NL63 can be grown in immortalized bat cell lines, suggesting their potential association with bats (Huynh et al., 2012). This has led to speculations about an evolutionary origin of all mammalian CoVs in bat hosts (Woo et al., 2009a, c). However, how humans become exposed to remote wildlife viruses is not always clear (Wolfe et al., 2007).",

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) established a molecular demarcation method for species assignment using the conserved domains of replicase polyprotein and the pairwise amino acid distance of 90% as threshold value. The Alpha-CoVs are classified into 11 species, 6 of which detected in bats: Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1, Bat coronavirus CDPHE15, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8, Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, Bat coronavirus HKU10, and Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512, and some strains that to date are not assigned. However, the number of bat species that host CoVs is still unknown and increases proportionally with the increasing of surveillance. In this study, we describe the full genome sequencing by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), the characterization and the classification of two novel Alpha-CoV species detected from three Italian Pipistrellus kuhlii bats (Lelli et al., 2013).",

The first sequence analysis was performed by BLASTn, comparing the Italian strains with those available online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The BLASTn search showed similarities with an unclassified strain BtNv-AlphaCoV/SC2013 (KJ473809), and with those viruses classified into HKU10 bat and Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) species. BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 shared a 97% nucleotide identity (nt. id.), and BatCoV-Ita3 shared 70.9% and 71% nt. id. with BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5, respectively, at the full genome level. The same differences were observed when the ORF nucleotide sequences were aligned separately. BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 shared >97% nt. id. in all the ORFs. BatCoV-Ita3 showed the highest differences in the S, ORF3 and N genes with <65% nt. id. Fewer differences were observed at the ORF1ab, M and E genes (>70% nt. id.) compared to the other two Italian strains. Their genome organization was similar to other Alpha-CoV species, comprehending 6 ORFs and two non-translated termini in the order of 5\u2032 terminus-ORF1ab-spike-ORF3-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032 terminus (Table 1\n). In the ORF1ab, it has been observed that the predicted slippery sequence \u201cUUUAAAC\u201d is involved in the synthesis of the replicase pp1ab polyprotein by ribosomal frameshift, a characteristic of the Nidovirales order. The sizes, the genomic localization and the 15 expected cleavage sites of the nonstructural protein (NSP 1\u201316) that are encoded by ORF1ab, were predicted by sequence comparison with other Alpha-CoV species (Table 2\n). BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 showed the same sequences of cleavage sites. BatCoV-Ita3, compared to the other 2 strains, showed two amino acid changes in the cleavage sites between NSP1/NSP2 and NSP12/NSP13. A leader predicted transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-L), and the putative body TRSs, representing signals for the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), have been identified in the three genomes (Table 1). The TRS-L and TRSs preceded the codon start of all ORFs in BatCoV-Ita3 and suggested the synthesis of 6 monocistronic subgenomic mRNAs. The lack of TRSs before the ORF3 gene codon start in BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 suggests the synthesis of 4 monocistronic and 1 polycistronic subgenomic mRNAs. The differences at the nucleotide level were also confirmed at the amino acid level. BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 showed high similarities (<97%) and high differences with BatCoV-Ita3 in the spike, ORF3 and nucleocapsid proteins. The ICTV has established the 90% amino acid sequence identity of the seven concatenated domains within the ORF1ab as the threshold value to assign two strains to the same species: NSP3 (ADRP), NSP5 (3CLpro), NSP12 (RdRp), NSP13 (Hel, NTPase), NSP14 (ExoN, NMT), NSP15 (NendoU), and NSP16 (OMT). To classify the Italian strains into known coronavirus species, the ORF1ab concatenated domains were compared with the 11 Alpha-CoV species: Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1, Bat coronavirus CDPHE15, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8, Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, Bat coronavirus HKU10, Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512, PEDV, HuCoV-229E, HuCoV-NL63, AlphaCoVs1, and some strains that to date are not assigned. BatCoV-Ita3 concatenated domains showed sequence identities <83.8% with all the Alpha-CoV strains. BatCoV-Ita4 and BatCoV-Ita5 shared 99.3% identity and had <79.1% with all other Alpha-CoVs, suggesting that the classification of the Italian strains should be into two novel Alpha-CoVs species.",

The analysis on the full BatCoV-Ita sequences showed similarities to the Alpha-coronavirus genera and genome organization with 6 open reading frames (ORFs) and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-translated sequences. The phylogenetic analysis using the complete genomes showed correlation but with a low nucleotide identity with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 in the Nyctalus velutinus species. The phylogenetic analysis on amino acidic sequences also confirmed the correlation with the Chinese strain and supported the hypothesis that bat strains of Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8, and Bat coronavirus HKU10 species and some unclassified strains may share a common spike ancestor. However, the analysis of the protein structure was hampered by the lack of similar spike protein structure.

During the last fifteen years, two Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have jumped from bats to a mammalian intermediate host to humans (Field, 2009; Omrani et al., 2015). In addition, strains related to human Alpha-CoVs (HuCoV-229E, HuCoV-NL63) have been detected in bats, indicating the importance of the bat as a CoV reservoir (Pfefferle et al., 2009; Corman et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2017; Waruhiu et al., 2017). In this study, we characterized two Alpha-CoVs from Italian bats divergent from human CoVs strains and two new Alpha-CoV species. In addition, the RdRp phylogenetic tree showed that the strains here described were not related to the Alpha-CoV species established so far. This result highlights that the heterogeneity of CoVs in the bat may be higher than what is known to date. Indeed, to better understand the CoV species circulating in bats, their evolution and our understanding of the mechanisms important to cross the species barrier, it is important to have long-term vigilance followed by the complete genome characterization.",
