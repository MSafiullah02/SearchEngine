Accurate and timely diagnosis of these viral pathogens is critical because of the measures that have to be implemented for the monitoring and management of the patient and for the prevention of secondary cases or nosocomial spread. Early identification of viral species also has a great impact on public health initiatives, as we experienced with severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) or currently experiencing with recently emerging or re\u2010emerging viruses such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) and Zika virus (ZIKAV). Most of these viral pathogens are of zoonotic origin and can be transmitted to humans either directly such as filoviruses and arenaviruses or via arthropod vectors (mosquitoes, ticks, midges, sandflies) such as flaviviruses and bunyaviruses (arboviruses).",

This is supported by the discovery of new arboviruses5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and novel and highly divergent flaviviruses such as Tamana bat virus,13 Ngoye virus,14 Nounan\u00e9 virus (NOUV),15 and Lammi virus (LAMV).16\n",

Cities such as Jeddah, Makkah, and Al\u2010madinah in western Saudi Arabia are endemic for DENV and AHFV, and represent a major destination for pilgrims coming for annual Hajj and/or Umrah pilgrimages from all over the world. This clearly poses a great concern about the possible introduction of new viruses into the Kingdom [Azhar et al., 2016].24 Although there have been no reports of Zika infection in Saudi up to now, the current outbreak in South and Central America as well as the heavy travel to Saudi from all over the world may put the Kingdom at the front\u2010line in the fight against ZIKAV particularly with the high prevalence of Aedes aegypti which is the vector for both Zika and dengue viruses.26 Furthermore, it is not clear whether other flaviviruses do exist in Saudi Arabia or not mostly because of the limited number of surveillance studies and the lack of systematic screening of patients with unexplained febrile illnesses, thus substantial number of cases may remain undiscovered or unrecognized.",

            "text": "Most of the currently available viral diagnostic tests are based on specific target testing for a single viral type. Therefore, hypothesis\u2010driven diagnostic approaches are usually undertaken when a particular virus is suspected. However, these conventional methods have some drawbacks in identifying novel, altered or unpredictable viruses which represent a big challenge in diagnostic virology. This is further complicated when broad range of viruses are expected as in the case of viral febrile illness. Therefore, genus\u2010specific diagnostic approaches can be used because they are less sensitive to failure compared to targeted molecular approaches. Several assays based on molecular amplification of highly conserved fragments in the NS3 and NS5 regions of flaviviruses have been developed27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and proven to be a valuable tool in the discovery of new classical and atypical flaviviruses. However, most of these techniques depend on the use of conventional RT\u2010PCR format, nested PCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis which could hamper the sensitivity and specificity of these assays due to PCR contamination and false\u2010positive results. Moureau et al developed a single\u2010step universal flaviviruses (pan\u2010flaviviruses) real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR which was able to identify at least 54 different known or tentative flaviviruses.38 This assay combines the SybrGreen format of the real\u2010time PCR which facilitate large\u2010scale testing without PCR contamination risk, and the universal detection of known and tentative flavivirus species. The sensitivity of this assay was found to be high (>50 copies/reaction) which permitted the detection of several flaviviruses from field and clinical samples. Most importantly, sequencing of the short NS5 fragment amplified by this assay (\u223c232 nts) is suitable for reliable identification and taxonomic characterization of flaviviruses as well as the discovery of novel viral species. Therefore, this study was designed not only to screen for possible circulation and/or introduction of new or previously uncharacterized flaviviruses such as ZIKAV but also to phylogenetically characterize circulating DENV in the western region of Saudi Arabia using this pan\u2010flaviviruses assay.38\n",

Multiple alignment of this 2014 strain with other available complete AHFV sequences in the GenBank database showed high homology with 99.7% identity with the last isolate of AHFV obtained in 2011 in Saudi Arabia (2011\u2010JX271893\u2010Saudi\u2010Human). Although these two most recent isolates showed several similar but unique synonymous mutations scattered throughout the genome compared to other AHFV sequences (Table 2), only four unique non\u2010synonymous mutations in the coding region resulted in distinctive amino acid substitutions in these two isolates that were not observed in other isolates (Table 3).

However, whether other flaviviral species are circulating in the Kingdom is not known because of the few number of surveillance studies. Several emerging and re\u2010emerging flaviviruses such as ZIKAV are being reported and characterized globally. This is of great concern especially for countries such as Saudi Arabia where the largest annual mass\u2010gathering event (Hajj) may exacerbate the spread of these viruses all over the world. Moreover, the similarity in clinical signs and symptoms of viral febrile illnesses and the use of species\u2010specific diagnostic assays add several limitations to the ability to differentiate between causative viruses especially when several viruses are co\u2010circulating. Therefore, accurate and timely identification of causative viruses is critically important in order to minimize the risk of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, introduction of new viruses and potential outbreaks or epidemics.",

While we did not find any evidence of ZIKAV nor any unexpected flaviviruses in the current study, the potential introduction of such viruses into Saudi is highly possible during Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages especially with the rapidly increasing number of Zika cases. Therefore, further surveillance studies are necessary to confirm the absence of ZIKAV in Saudi Arabia. This is of utmost importance considering the Hajj and Umrah mass gatherings and the continuous travelling to and from Saudi Arabia all year around.",

DENV\u20102 was the most detected virus during this period confirming its higher prevalence as previously reported.18, 44, 45 The close clustering of DENV\u20102 and DENV\u20103 isolates reported in the current study with strains from Pakistan and India demonstrate that several DENV viruses might have been imported into Saudi Arabia from hyper\u2010endemic regions with travelers and pilgrims which provide further evidence to support our previous conclusions.24, 25 In addition, our data show that the DENV\u20102 Cosmopolitan genotype and DENV\u20103 genotype GIII are the only reported genotypes from Saudi Arabia so far since their first isolation in 1994.24 DENV\u20101 is known to be one of the circulating viruses in Saudi Arabia,18, 25, 44, 45 and few cases of DENV\u20104 infection have been detected in Jeddah in 2015 (personal communication). However, we did not detect any DENV\u20101 or DENV\u20104 in the tested samples. While these results may suggest low circulation of these viruses, more samples should be tested to draw such conclusion. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the known endemicity of DENV in western region of Saudi Arabia.",

The isolation of AHFV in the current study from one of the samples which was originally examined for DENV only clearly provides an evidence that many cases of AHFV are being missed during clinical testing. Thus, implementation of assays such as the one used in this study could be an important diagnostic and research tool. The observed low diversity and slow microevolution of AHFV is consistent with the sporadic nature of the infection and the limited number of reported cases, most probably due to the less mobile vector (ticks). Furthermore, while this low genetic diversity suggests that current molecular tests are still suitable for AHFV diagnosis, it is critical to carry out more genomic studies not only to enhance diagnostic tools but also to better understand the replication and pathogenesis of AHFV and to develop vaccines and therapeutics.",
