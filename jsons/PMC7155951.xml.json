In order to face it, the Italian government has placed the whole of Italy\u2014a country with an estimated population of 60.4 million\u2014under quarantine. In detail quarantine is defined as people are forbidden from assembling in public places and are recommended to keep at least 1-m distance from each other, and restaurants, pubs, and shopping centers\u2014except for pharmacies and food markets\u2014are obligated to remain close. These norms are even more rigorous in Lombardy, a large region in northern Italy, where most hot zones (i.e., where COVID-19 cases are more concentrated) have been reported to date.",
