            "text": "Host cells have evolved numerous innate defenses against virus infection, including a collection of constitutively expressed antiviral restriction factors and a variety of specialized responses induced by viral infection. A major component of the induced innate immune response to viral infections is the activation of antiviral interferons (IFNs), which transcriptionally induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs have varied functions, including regulating the IFN response or, alternatively, encoding effector molecules that directly inhibit viral infection. Collectively, the ISG response facilitates clearance of virus from infected cells, establishes a protective antiviral state in uninfected cells, and promotes adaptive immune responses (Samuel, 2001).",

The ISG functions that have been characterized frequently target conserved aspects of virus infections.

Functional screening approaches, including ISG overexpression and knockdown screens, have been used to catalog a broader range of putative IFN-induced antiviral effectors (Ablasser and Hornung, 2013, Fusco et al., 2013, Karki et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2012, Metz et al., 2012, Schoggins et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2012).

As such, they are attractive targets for innate immune defenses and the development of therapeutics. For example, many viruses require fatty acid biosynthesis for their replication and assembly (reviewed in Chukkapalli et al., 2012). AMP kinase, which is not an ISG, limits viral replication by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis, acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (Moser et al., 2012). Indeed, one of the more extensively characterized ISGs, viperin, can modulate virus infections by impacting lipids in multiple ways. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) co-opts viperin to inhibit lipid \u03b2-oxidation, which in turn stimulates lipid biogenesis that supports virion envelopment. Viperin also inhibits isoprenoid synthesis, which disrupts lipid rafts and, in turn, limits virus infection that requires lipid rafts for virus entry or budding (reviewed in Seo et al., 2011).",

            "text": "A major lipid-dependent interaction in enveloped virus infection is the fusion of the virion lipid bilayer with a cellular membrane to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Plemper, 2011). This can occur either at the plasma membrane or at distinct endosomal compartments, governed in part by the pH dependence of the viral fusion apparatus. Generically, fusion occurs when the interaction of the viral envelope protein(s) with the host cell produces conformational changes in the viral fusion protein that expose its fusion peptide and generate sufficient free energy to facilitate membrane fusion, which is inherently an energetically unfavorable event. In the case of viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane, conformational changes in the fusion protein that occur after receptor engagement are sufficient to drive fusion. For viruses that fuse in endosomal compartments, protonation of the fusion protein that occurs with acidifying endocytic pH frequently promotes fusion. Additionally, endosomal or lysosomal proteases that cleave the fusion protein or, alternatively, endosomal lipids and/or protein receptors can promote the fusion process (Plemper, 2011). Once the fusion protein has positioned the viral envelope in close proximity to the cellular membrane, hemifusion, in which the outer leaflets of the viral and cellular lipid bilayers fuse, can occur (Figure 1\nA). Following hemifusion, an early fusion pore forms, which then enlarges to a late fusion pore through which the viral nucelocapsid is released into the cytoplasm. Important for this review, the fusion process, and hemifusion in particular, is sensitive to the lipid composition of membranes, which affects membrane curvature and fluidity (Figure 1B). As such, the modulation of membrane lipid composition is a viable approach to inhibit virion fusion. In this review, we discuss a number of recent discoveries that characterize host restriction of viral infection, especially virion fusion, by modifying pathways that synthesize, process, or transport lipids to alter membrane composition.",

            "text": "In a recent study, microarray profiling of macrophages either treated with IFN-\u03b3 or infected with murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) identified repression of the sterol biosynthetic pathway as a significant component of IFN antiviral effects (Blanc et al., 2011). The consequence of repressed sterol biosynthetic gene expression was a reduction in levels of cellular cholesterol. The class of drugs known as statins impairs cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme required for synthesis of the cholesterol intermediate mevalonate. Cells treated with simvastatin were resistant to mCMV, and culturing cells with mevalonate, but not cholesterol, reversed this resistance. The silencing of either Hmgcs1 or Hmgcr, two genes encoding enzymes in sterol biosynthesis, resulted in decreased mCMV infection. Collectively, these studies point to a role for the proximal mevalonate arm of sterol biosynthesis, but not cholesterol itself, in regulating mCMV infection (Figure 2\n). The authors hypothesize a requirement for the prenylation of viral and/or cellular proteins in mCMV infection. The repression of sterol biosynthesis by IFN appears to occur via the reduced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a transcriptional regulator of sterol biosynthesis. mCMV-infected mice treated with simvastatin had 1- to 1.5-log reductions in viral titers in spleen, liver, kidney, heart, and lungs.",

Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h in mice, CH25H in humans) catalyzes the synthesis of 25HC from cholesterol. CH25H and 25HC are increasingly implicated in modulating host immunity at multiple levels. For example, 25HC has been shown to suppress the production of immunoglobulin A (IgA) by B cells, and Ch25h\n\u2212/\u2212 mice have increased IgA levels in serum (Bauman et al., 2009). 25HC has also been implicated in suppressing the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages (Ecker et al., 2010). Dendritic cells and macrophages upregulate CH25H in response to type I IFNs, suggesting a potential role for 25HC in innate immunity (Park and Scott, 2010).",

            "text": "An overexpression screen designed to identify IFN-induced antiviral effectors uncovered an antiviral role for CH25H (Liu et al., 2012). Ectopic expression of CH25H in 293T cells conferred a strong antiviral effect against two enveloped viruses: the DNA virus murine gamma herpesvirus 6 (MHV68) and the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In a follow-up study, the same group characterized the mechanisms of CH25H antiviral activity (Liu et al., 2013). They used either shRNA-mediated knockdown of Ch25h or cells from Ch25h\n\u2212/\u2212 mice to show that optimal control of VSV replication required Ch25h. In a series of media transfer experiments, it was demonstrated that CH25H expression produces a soluble antiviral factor that was not type I IFN. Thus, the authors examined the natural product of CH25H activity, 25HC. Indeed, exogenous addition of 25HC to cells suppressed VSV infection. Remarkably, a pan-antiviral effect of 25HC was demonstrated against a panel of enveloped viruses including HIV-1, MHV68, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), ebolavirus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Nipah virus. 25HC had no effect on the nonenveloped adenovirus, suggesting that the antiviral effects may be specific to enveloped viruses, although other nonenveloped viruses remain to be characterized. The antiviral potency of 25HC was variable depending on the virus, with effects on viral titers ranging from 2-fold to more than 10-fold. The antiviral effects of 25HC on VSV infection were selective relative to other oxysterols and independent of other known 25HC functions, including the regulation of SREBP2, mevalonate production, or protein prenylation (Liu et al., 2013).",

In a cell-cell membrane fusion assay using only the Nipah virus fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins, 25HC was shown to reduce syncytia formation. This surrogate assay suggests that similar mechanisms may be operating at the viral-host membrane interface. The antiviral effect of 25HC on VSV could be competed by incubating the 25HC-containing VSV inoculum with artificial liposomes containing lipid content similar to cellular membranes. These rescue experiments further suggest that 25HC directly alters cellular membranes, thereby interfering with virus entry (Figure 3\n). Lastly, 25HC inhibited HIV in a humanized mouse model, and Ch25h\n\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to MHV68 than wild-type mice were, thereby solidifying the importance of this oxysterol pathway in innate antiviral immunity in vivo (Liu et al., 2013).",

            "text": "25HC was also uncovered as an IFN-induced antiviral molecule using a distinct metabolomics approach (Blanc et al., 2013). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of oxysterols selectively identified 25HC as upregulated by mouse macrophages after either viral infection or IFN treatment. Similar to the results by Liu et al. (2013), the authors demonstrated that exogenous 25HC had antiviral effects against a panel of enveloped viruses, but no effect on adenovirus. To dissect the selectivity of 25HC, an enantiomer of 25HC, ent-25HC, was tested for effects on viral growth. This compound was also able to suppress viral infection, but only at high concentrations. The authors conclude that the enantioselectivity of 25HC antiviral action may suggest additional membrane-independent functions of 25HC. Although HSV-1 entry was inhibited by 25HC, other enveloped viruses were inhibited by 25HC at postentry steps. 25HC treatment of cells infected with mCMV, influenza A virus (IAV), or MHV68 resulted in a small plaque phenotype, whereas the total number of plaques was not impacted by 25HC. Thus, 25HC likely does not affect the infectivity of the viral inoculum, but rather impairs the ability of the virus to spread. This result is indicative of a postentry inhibition of these virus infections, possibly at the stage of cell-cell spread, as was shown by the authors for varicella zoster virus infection. The somewhat different conclusions of the two studies with regards to 25HC mechanism of action may represent differences in experimental conditions. For example, Blanc et al. (2013) used delipidated media in their studies, while Liu et al. (2013) used normal serum-complemented media. The differential effects of these media formulations in the context of antiviral mechanisms are unclear. Nonetheless, it is likely that 25HC can exert antiviral activity at multiple stages of the viral life cycle. In the case of mCMV infection, evidence was presented for both SREBP-dependent and SREBP-independent modes of 25HC antiviral action. Both studies implicate additional postentry roles for 25HC, including inhibition of virus-induced cell-cell fusion (syncytia formation) and virus spread. Additionally, 25HC has been found to interfere with the replication of HCV, possibly by altering the lipid composition of membranous replication compartments or protein prenylation (Pezacki et al., 2009). Similar mechanisms may be responsible for 25HC effects on viruses such as mCMV. Thus, 25HC has the attributes to modulate virus infections at many levels.",

The various IFITMs exhibit inhibitory activity against multiple enveloped viruses prior to fusion, with their commonality being that the subset of inhibited viruses appears to share the same cellular location for virion fusion (reviewed in Diamond and Farzan, 2013). For example, IFITM3 inhibits the fusion of influenza A virus (IAV), dengue virus, and West Nile viruse, which fuse at the late endosome (LE), while IFITM1 preferentially inhibits ebolavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which fuse at the lysosome (Brass et al., 2009, Feeley et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2011). IFITM3 is particularly important for the control of IAV in vivo. IFITM3 knockout mice have enhanced pathology following IAV infection (Bailey et al., 2012). In humans, a rare IFITM3 allele with reduced anti-iAV efficacy has been identified in hospitalized patients presenting with severe influenza (Bailey et al., 2012, Everitt et al., 2012). IFITMs generally do not restrict viral fusion at the plasma membrane or recycling endosome. In support of a model wherein the site of fusion determines IFITM antiviral activity, SARS coronavirus, which is typically restricted by IFITM1, becomes resistant to restriction if it is pretreated with trypsin to enable plasma membrane fusion (Huang et al., 2011). IFITM proteins primarily localize to cytosolic vesicles, including LEs. These data have led to the hypothesis that IFITMs may modify either the pH or lipid composition of LEs and lysosomes to render them resistant to fusion. IFITMs, particularly IFITM1, can also localize to the plasma membrane following overexpression or interferon induction. Thus, IFITM1 can also efficiently inhibit cell-cell fusion (syncytia formation), HCV coreceptor interactions, and HIV replication at a postentry step (Li et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2011, Wilkins et al., 2013).",

IFITM expression alters the biophysical properties of membranes.

The first intramembranous domain plus the conserved cytosolic loop compromise a CD225 domain, which is present in over 300 proteins. Mutagenesis studies show that the N-terminal cytosolic domain and the CD225 domain are essential for IFITM3 function (John et al., 2013). Amino acids in the intramembranous portion of the CD225 domain are required for IFITM self-association, leading to a model wherein IFITM3 homomeric interactions alter endosomal membrane fluidity and curvature (Figure 3).",

VAPA interacts with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) to transfer cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to organelles and vesicles. IFITM1\u2013IFITM3 all bind VAPA via the second transmembranous domain, and the binding of IFITM3 to VAPA interferes with the VAPA-OSBP interaction. IFITM3 overexpression altered cellular cholesterol levels, with increased accumulation of cholesterol and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) in LE and multivesicular body (MVB) compartments. Increased endosomal cholesterol and LBPA can perturb virion fusion (Chevallier et al., 2008). The IFITM3-VAPA interaction appeared to be important for inhibition of VSV and IAV entry. In the case of VSV infection, IFITM3 expression resulted in the accumulation of VSV in MVBs during the entry process, suggestive of a block in fusion. The authors propose a model wherein IFITMs bind VAPA and recruit it to endosomal compartments to transfer cholesterol and LBPA, creating a lipid environment that is resistant to virion fusion (Figure 3).",

Its accumulation at the plasma membrane is transiently increased following HCMV infection and is associated with decreased intracellular cholesterol. Inhibition of LRP1 expression or function elevated intracellular cholesterol and enhanced infectious HCMV production (Gudleski-O\u2019Regan et al., 2012). This effect is due to increased cholesterol in HCMV virions, leading to an enhanced specific infectivity. It was speculated that this increased infectivity is due to enhanced fusion, since HCMV fusion requires cholesterol.

These compounds insert into membranes and are predicted to produce positive membrane curvature in the outer leaflets, thereby inhibiting hemifusion. LJ001, a rhodanine derivative that is chemically distinct from RAFIs, also inhibits the replication of enveloped viruses by targeting the membrane component (Wolf et al., 2010). Interestingly, its mechanism of action is not simply based on mimicking a lipid shape, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). It intercalates lipid bilayers and acts as a photosensitizer, hydroxylating the fatty acid chains of unsaturated phospholipids (Vigant et al., 2013).

In the case of 25HC, at least four major questions remain. (i) As a secreted oxysterol that can permeate membranes, what is the primary target membrane to inhibit virion fusion? Since entry has already occurred in the infected cell, two nonexclusive possibilities remain: modification of neighboring cellular membranes in a paracrine manner or, alternatively, directly neutralizing intra- or extracellular virions. (ii) What is the chemical basis of 25HC fusion inhibition? Options include the exclusion of cholesterol and alterations of membrane fluid dynamics by 25HC lipid packing properties. (iii) What are the mechanisms of postfusion 25HC antiviral activity? As lipids are required at virtually every stage of the viral life cycle, there are multiple potential intervention points. Additionally, 25HC regulates sterol biosynthesis at multiple stages, suggesting potential indirect roles in antiviral regulation. (iv) 25HC has been shown to regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. How does 25HC integrate the two arms of the immune system to orchestrate an effective antiviral response? Given that LJ001 functions by hydroxylating fatty acid chains, one wonders whether increasing the hydroxylated lipid content in membranes is a more general approach to inhibiting viral fusion.",

Do they individually recruit VAPA to distinct endosomal compartments? Do ISGs modulate lipid composition at other locations, such as the plasma membrane, to inhibit viral fusion? Finally, although most IFITM studies have focused on fusion, it remains possible that they may also inhibit subsequent events in the viral life cycle. The lipid composition of intracellular organelles is likely important for membrane remodeling to establish sites of replication for positive strand RNA viruses. HCV interacts with VAPA and requires VAPA and OSBP for its replication. Additionally, multiple viruses access MVBs as part of their egress and may be impacted by IFITMs. The inhibition of later stages of the viral life cycle would provide an antiviral role for IFN induction of IFITMs within the infected cell and not just in establishing an environment that is resistant to viral entry in naive cells.",

As an example, bioactive lipids from the 12/15 lipoxygenase pathway have recently been discovered to modulate IAV infection. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) lipid mediator D1 (PD1) inhibits IAV infection in cell culture (Morita et al., 2013). It acts at the stage of early gene expression, preventing the export of viral messenger and genomic RNAs by inhibiting their interaction with the nuclear export factor NXF1 by an unknown mechanism. PD1 levels are decreased during IAV infection in vivo, and its expression inversely correlates with disease severity. Tam et al. (2013) also identified 12/15 lipoxygenase-derived metabolites that differentially accumulate in response to IAV infection in vivo. Importantly, their accumulation correlates with both antiviral activity and resolution of inflammation. PD1 administration in IAV lung infection in mice reduced viral titers and improved survival, suggesting therapeutic potential. Thus, lipids have multiple roles in antiviral innate and adaptive responses, in control of inflammation, and potentially in the development of antiviral therapeutics.",
