Several case\u2013control studies have repeatedly confirmed the common clinical observation that respiratory tract infections often shortly precede or accompany acute ischemic strokes or acute myocardial infarctions [2, 3, 4, 5]. A large population based case\u2010series study found a relative risk ratio of 4.95 for acute myocardial infarction in the first 3 days following respiratory tract infections [5]. Influenza is recognized as a major risk factor for the occurrence of acute ischemic cardiovascular events in the elderly population. Epidemiologic evidence consistently proves a decrease in cardiovascular mortality following vaccinations with influenza [6]. Thus far limited data are available on the changes in platelet aggregation during common viral respiratory tract infections, that are most commonly due to rhinovirus and coronavirus infections (40\u201365% of cases combined) [7].",

Platelet aggregation was determined using a Chronolog Lumi\u2010Aggregometer as previously described [9]. Platelets were stimulated at 37 \u00b0C with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at concentrations of 1, 5 and 20 \u03bc\nm.

We demonstrated that platelets were more sensitive to a lower dose of an important agonist (1 \u03bc\nm ADP), but did not demonstrate any difference in their maximal aggregation induced by higher doses (5 and 20 \u03bc\nm ADP). The finding of increased P\u2010selectin expression is consistent with the presence of activated platelets in the peripheral venous circulation during viral illness. Our data support the concept of a systemic pro\u2010aggregatory state during or shortly after viral infections as postulated by earlier studies. Changes in coagulation, platelet aggregation, lipid metabolism, smooth muscle spasm, plaque composition, and alteration of endothelial function have been postulated as a mechanism underlying this observation [2, 3, 4, 5].",

P\u2010selectin is essential in controlling platelet rolling at sites of vascular injury and enhances local thrombus formation by cytokine and tissue factor release from monocytes [10]. Circulating activated platelets exacerbate atherosclerosis in mice deficient in apolipoprotein E, an effect that was reduced when using P\u2010selectin\u2010deficient platelets, thus underlining the importance of P\u2010selectin in platelet\u2010dependent inflammation [11]. Also higher levels of activated platelets have been consistently documented in acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, microangiopathic diabetes mellitus, and stroke. The source of the activated platelets documented in our study remains unclear.",
