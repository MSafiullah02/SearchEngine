Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s. In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection. Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process.

Indeed, the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic was caused by a coronavirus variant that appears to have emerged from a bat reservoir to infect palm civets, sold live in open markets, which served as intermediate reservoirs before crossing into humans.

Furthermore, even though the use of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A in HCoV-OC43-infected mice resulted in a faster onset of encephalitis, suggesting a role for T-cells in viral clearance and survival with no related immunopathology [71] , it was shown that in recombination activation gene (RAG) knock-out mice, HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection [93] .

Importantly, these S point mutations were acquired after persistent infections of human neural cell lines [112] . Moreover, we also showed that infection by the S mutants is linked to glutamate excitotoxicity [113] . Therefore, as this increase in cytokine production may induce damages to the neurons [114] that can be associated with problems in glutamate homeostasis, which in the end may create glutamate excitotoxicity [115] , it can contribute to neuronal degeneration associated with hind-limb paralysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , and possible demyelination [111, 113] .

These cell death pathways can act separately but may also interact in response to a stimulus (including a viral infection), as they share some of the cellular factors involved in the overall process that leads to cell death and that often converges toward mitochondria [118] . Figure 3 is a tentative representation of the various pathways and cellular factors involved during HCoV-OC43-induced PCD of infected neurons. It is based on our data [111, 113, 116, 117] and on the scientific literature that describes some molecular pathways (parthanatos, necroptosis and apoptosis) and cellular factors, including calcium overload, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, excitotoxicity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), calpain and oxidative stress related to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventual neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death [118] [119] [120] . Virus-cell interaction is always important in the regulation of cell response to infection. For HCoV-OC43, we clearly showed that the viral S glycoprotein is an important factor of neurovirulence and neurodegeneration of infected cells [111, 113, 116] . This was similarly shown for coronavirus strains MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM, which represent subspecies of the MuCoV species, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43 as they are both members of the Betacoronavirus genus. Indeed, several reports and reviews have, over the years, described that S protein of this neuroinvasive and neurotropic murine coronavirus is a major factor associated with neurovirulence during encephalitis and the eventual demyelinating disease in susceptible mice [121, 122] . Our more recent data also demonstrated that the HE protein is an important factor for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43, suggesting an attenuation of the eventual spread of viruses deficient in fully active HE protein into the CNS [123] . Therefore, as the infection of neuronal cells apparently directly participate in the induction of neuronal death, by abrogating the production of infectious virus, the HE protein of HCoV-OC43 could play a role in neurovirulence of HCoV-OC43, like it does for MHV [124] . (1) Hallmarks of apoptosis, including relocalization of the activated pro-apoptotic protein BAX (Bcl-2 associated protein X) from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome C release from mitochondria toward the cytosol, DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspases -3 and -9, are observed during infection of human neurons. However, using a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), cell death is not abrogated after infection, suggesting a caspase-independent type of apoptosis. (2) Relocalization of the mitochondrial protein AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) toward the nucleus (tAIF) is observed after infection and participates in DNA fragmentation in conjunction with CypA (cyclophilin A) and histone H2AX. The AIF is known to be activated during caspase-independent apoptosis. However, AIF is also involved in Parthanatos, another form of PCD potentially associated with neurodegeneration. As they are synthesized by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) during a neuronal stress, including during HCoV-OC43 infection, polymers of ADPribose (PAR) may relocalize toward mitochondria and participate in the activation and relocalization of AIF toward the cytosol before it reaches the nucleus. Cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibition decreases AIF release from mitochondria and abrogates cell death induced by infection. (3) AIF release from mitochondria may be induced through its truncation (tAIF) by activated calpain, which is usually activated by a rise in the mitochondrial calcium concentration. (4) This increase in calcium concentration may be linked with either an important entry from the extracellular milieu (for instance during excitotoxicity) or with a release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following induction of ER stress. Both situations are probably taking place after infection of neurons by HCoV-OC43. The increase in calcium concentration in mitochondria may also induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be harmful for mitochondria and hence neurons. (5) The presence during infection of an inhibitor (Nec-1) of the receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP-1), significantly increases cell survival and partially abrogates viral replication, suggesting that necroptosis, a third form of PCD which involves RIP-1 and RIP-3 downstream of the tumor necrosing factor (TNF) receptor family (in the form of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)), may play a role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal death. Solid arrows indicate experimental data and dashed arrows represent possible pathways based on the current literature (see text for details) As mentioned above, SARS-CoV is also neuroinvasive and neurotropic in humans [67, 68] and it could therefore be associated with the development of a neurological disease. Furthermore, the involvement of SARS-CoV in CNS infections was underscored by the findings that made use of transgenic mouse models expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (the cellular receptor used by SARS-CoV to infect susceptible cells). Indeed, using these mice, it was shown that SARS-CoV could invade the CNS after an intranasal infection primarily through the olfactory bulb [95] or even after an intraperitoneal infection [125] , with concomitant neuronal loss [95, 125] ; a phenomenon that can eventually lead to neurological problems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 311, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 583, "end": 588, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 758, "end": 763, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "text": "113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 769, "end": 773, "text": "116,", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1215, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1221, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1471, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1481, "text": "116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1967, "text": "[121,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1972, "text": "122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2216, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2487, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 3995, "end": 3998, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 4502, "end": 4505, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 5171, "end": 5175, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 5176, "end": 5179, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 5661, "end": 5665, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 5709, "end": 5714, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 5748, "end": 5752, "text": "[95,", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 5753, "end": 5757, "text": "125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 599, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Possible Coronaviral-Induced Neuroimmunopathology"}, {"text": "The presence of coronaviruses in the human central nervous system is now a recognized fact as they appear to be part of a viral flora of the brain, with potential neuropathological consequences in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals, with or without additional environmental insults.
