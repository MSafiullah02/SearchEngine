HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors are most commonly pseudotyped with the surface glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). Pseudotyping with VSV-G allows the production of high-titer vector preparations.1 Furthermore, the broad tropism of VSV-G results in the efficient transduction of various tissue targets. In addition to VSV-G, surface glycoproteins from other enveloped viruses such as Ebola Zaire,2,3 lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV),4 Mokola,5 gibbon ape leukemia,6 respiratory syncytial,2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus7 have been used to generate pseudotyped HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors. In addition to HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors, nonprimate lentiviral vectors (i.e., feline immunodeficiency virus) are also being developed,8,9 which have the added advantage of improved safety and minimal risk of generation of wild-type virus by homologous recombination.",

To improve the transduction of airway epithelium in vivo, envelope glycoproteins derived from viruses tropic for airway epithelium, such as Ebola,2,3 GP64,8,9 and severe acute respiratory syndrome,7 have been generated. Although their transduction efficiency in in vitro model systems of airways2,7 and the mouse nasal airway epithelium has been encouraging, efficient transduction of lung epithelium by pseudotyped lentiviral vectors remains challenging. Most lung-directed gene transfer studies utilized VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors to transduce adult mouse lung or fetal mouse,10 fetal lamb,11 and fetal macaque lung.12 Transduction of mouse nasal airway by VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors requires preconditioning or damage of the airway for effective transduction.13,14 In lung VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV vector can transduce the alveolar epithelium and conducting airway epithelium in the absence of tight-junction disruption agents.10,11,12,15",

Vector-treated mice were killed 21 days later (peak of transgene expression in mouse lung; data not shown). The lungs were fixed for analysis of GFP expression and the spleens harvested for lymphocyte isolation and subsequent analysis for GFP- and/or gag-specific T-cell responses using the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. For C57BL/6 mice, GFP expression was evidenced only in the alveolar epithelium for all vectors at varying degrees of efficiency (Figure 1a,b). VSV-G- and NTDL6-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were the most efficient vectors followed by the Mokola and LCMV-pseudotypes (Figure 1a,b). Analysis of the splenocytes for GFP- and gag-specific T cells demonstrated significant GFP- and gag-specific T-cell activation only in mice treated with the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector (Figure 1c; P < 0.05, analysis of variance, Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test, n = 4). The transduction efficiency of the lentiviral vectors in BALB/c mouse lung was quite different when compared to C57BL/6 mouse lung. In this instance, the NTDL6-pseudotyped lentivirus vector was the most efficient at transducing the alveolar epithelium followed by the LCMV- and Mokola-pseudotyped vectors (Figure 1e,f). The least efficient vector in BALB/c mouse lung was the VSV-G-pseudotyped vector (Figure 1e,f). Most interesting, however, was the pattern of GFP-specific T-cell activation. In BALB/c mouse lung, all four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors activated high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 1g). No significant activation of gag-specific T cells was observed for any of the pseudotyped lentiviral vectors.",

It is well documented that direct muscle injection of vectors elicits high frequencies of transgene- and in some instances vector-specific T cells. Lentiviral vectors were pseudotyped with NTDL6, LCMV, Mokola, or VSV-G and injected into the right hindlimb of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice. A kinetics time course experiment of T-cell activation was performed in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, with day 17 chosen to represent the peak of T-cell activation following intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 1\u20134 \u00d7 108 transducing units (TU) (data not shown). C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (n = 4) were necropsied at day 17 after lentivirus vector injection. The spleens were harvested for lymphocyte isolation and subsequent analysis by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot for GFP- and gag (p17/p24)-specific T cells. For both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, all four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors activated high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 1d,h, respectively). There was also a nonstatistical significant trend of a higher GFP-specific T-cell activation in BALB/c mice. Intriguingly, we observed significant activation of gag-specific T cells only in C57BL/6 mice injected with the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector (Figure 1d).",

Although gene expression was stable in C57BL/6 mouse lung through to day 42, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05, analysis of variance, Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test) in the number of GFP-expressing cells by day 90. Interestingly, GFP-specific T cells were present as early as day 7, increased by day 42, and were still present at day 90 after vector injection (Figure 2b). For BALB/c mice, the number of GFP-positive alveolar epithelial cells was low but remained stable to day 21 (Figure 2d). By day 42, however, there was a significant decrease in the number of GFP-expressing cells and by the end of the experiment (day 90) only rare GFP-expressing cells were observed (Figure 2d). When compared to C57BL/6 mice, we observed similar GFP-specific T-cell activation at day 7. However, unlike in C57BL/6 mice, in BALB/c mice GFP-specific T-cell responses peaked at day 21 and remained at high levels through day 90 (the end of the experiment) (Figure 2e). Taken together, the GFP expression and transgene-specific T-cell activation data suggest that GFP-specific T cells destroyed GFP-expressing cells in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse lung around 6 weeks after vector injection, evidenced as a significant elevation of GFP-specific T cells and a significant decrease of GFP-expressing cells. Indeed, in BALB/c mice, we found a clear correlation between the high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 2e) and the diminution of GFP expression in lung (Figure 2d).",

When four different pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were injected i.t. into BALB/c mice, we observed high levels of transgene-specific T cells, the frequencies of which were similar to those observed following i.m. injection of these vectors. In C57BL/6 mice, only one of the four vectors, the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector, activated both transgene- and vector-specific T cells following i.t. delivery. This difference in T-cell activation between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice did not appear to depend on the vector performance in lung as the NTDL6-, LCMV-, and Mokola-pseudotyped vectors transduced the alveolar epithelium of both mouse models equally well. Interestingly, in the longitudinal gene expression studies, the kinetics of GFP-specific T-cell activation between the two mouse models was different. The peak of GFP-specific T-cell activation for C57BL/6 mice was found to be around day 42 whereas for BALB/c mice it appeared to be around day 21. When we correlated the frequency of GFP-specific T-cell activation with the corresponding number of GFP-expressing cells in the airway of each vector-treated animal, we observed a pattern of diminution of GFP expression soon after the peak of GFP-specific T-cell activation. As the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector was equally efficient at activating GFP-specific T cells in both mouse strains and given the availability of RAG-deficient/C57BL/6 mice, we studied the cytolytic properties of C57BL/6 lung-lymphocytes and also splenocytes activated in response to lung or muscle delivery of either VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector or adenovirus vector. We confirmed the previous findings that adoptive transfer of adenovirus-activated splenocytes in RAG-deficient/C57BL/6 mice can destroy transgene-expressing cells.25,26,27 We also found that lymphocytes isolated from lung of C57BL/6 mice injected i.t. with adenovirus can destroy transgene-expressing cells.

            "text": "It has become increasingly apparent that the therapeutic benefit of viral-mediated gene therapy may be hindered by the activation of destructive T cells activated in response to the therapeutic gene product and/or the gene transfer vector.28 Indeed, it is long known that adenovirus vector delivery to lung activates cytolytic transgene-specific T cells29 that have hampered the development of adenovirus as a gene therapy vector. Our findings suggest that similar issues are associated with the application of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in lung, which may hinder the development of these vectors for gene therapy of pulmonary genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. In this study, we used the GFP and luciferase reporter genes to study transgene-specific T-cell activation following lentivirus-mediated gene transfer to mouse lung. Both these transgenes have been demonstrated to elicit transgene-specific T cells in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.30 Nonimmunogenic transgenes, including rhesus \u03b1-fetoprotein31 and the rhesus \u03b2-chain of chorionic gonadotropin,32 which express \u201cself\u201d-antigen have demonstrated lack of transgene-specific immune response activation in large-animal gene transfer studies.31 However, for gene therapy of genetic diseases caused by specific gene mutation(s), it is highly probable that expression of the \u201cnormal\u201d therapeutic gene product will be recognized by the host as a \u201cnon-self\u201d-antigen thus activating transgene-specific T cells with potentially adverse effects. Indeed, using computational analysis, we predicted the likelihood of a CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)-specific T-cell activation following expression of the therapeutic CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis subjects with the most common mutation, a deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (\u0394F508) (ref. 33). We proposed that expression of the therapeutic CFTR in cystic fibrosis subjects with the \u0394F508 CFTR mutation could be subject to antigen crosspresentation or activation of quiescent CFTR-specific T cells. For the development of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of pulmonary diseases, we propose the evaluation of the impact of transgene-specific T cells in lentiviral-based preclinical animal studies.",
