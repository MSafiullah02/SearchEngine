A previous analysis was based on the assumption that the number of nasopharyngeal swabs would be constant, however the number of daily swabs has been increasing with an average factor of about four with respect to our previous analysis, Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of diagnosed positive cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time. We then consider five possible cases for the number of daily swabs and we then estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed positive cases. We then perform a number of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases. Finally, we present an alternative method to evaluate the uncertainty in our mathematical predictions based on the study of each region of Italy and we present an application of the Central Limit Theorem to display the uncertainty in our mathematical predictions based on the analysis of each region.",

At the time of our analysis (March 26), the average daily number of swabs from February 15 was about 9000 per day. However, from March 27 up to April 19, the average number of daily swabs was about 41500. Therefore, to study the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have to consider the analysis of the ratio of daily diagnosed positive cases per number of swabs. Since the number of daily swabs depends on factors that are unknown to us, such as the daily availability of reagents and specialized personnel, we have considered five possible cases for the daily number of swabs and we have also assumed some possible time evolution in the number of daily swabs. We fitted the time evolution of the positive cases per unit of swab up to April 19, using three different distributions: the Gauss, the Planck and the Gamma distribution. After estimating the time evolution of the positive cases per unit of swab using these three distributions and the conceivable number of daily swabs, we were able to estimate the evolution in the number of diagnosed positive cases and the dates of a substantial reduction in such a daily number.",

Now we have both the distributions fitting the daily positive cases per unit swab and the distributions fitting the number of daily swabs. In order to model the number of daily positive cases we can simply multiply these two distributions obtaining a total of nine cases. Just as an example we report here only one case. In Fig. 4 we report both the number of daily positive cases modeled with the product of two Gaussians (4a) and the cumulative number of positive cases modelled with the integral of such a product (4b). Since the product of two Gaussian is still a Gaussian, it is possible in this case to easily obtain the primitive which is the Error Function.

Since the number of daily swabs depends on factors that are difficult to predict, such as the daily availability of reagents and specialized personnel, we have considered five possible cases for the daily number of swabs corresponding to some relevant situations. The five cases are: 9000, i.e., the number of daily swabs equal to the mean of daily swabs between February 15 and March 26 (the date of our first analysis 1, 2 Tab. 1 shows a variability in the dates. That is partly due to the large variability in the number of daily swabs, from 9000 to 100000, which will obviously introduce a large variability in the number of positive cases. Therefore, the threshold value of 100 cases per day that was used should be renormalized for the number of daily swabs.",

The uncertainty we consider in the Monte Carlo simulation is not the difference between the total number of the actual positive cases (which is unknown) and the diagnosed ones which can be one order of magnitude higher, or even more, than the actual cases.

We have assumed a measurement uncertainty in the total number of positive cases equal to 20% of each daily number (Gaussian distributed). Then, a random matrix ( \u00d7 ) is generated, where (columns) is the number of observed days and (rows) is the number of random outcomes, which we have chosen to be 25000. Each number in the matrix is part of a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to 1 and sigma equal to 0.2 (i.e., 20% of 1), either row-wise and column-wise. So, starting from the nominal values of the daily data, we generated Gaussian distributions with 25000 outcomes, with means equal to the nominal values and with 20% standard deviation. Then, for each of the 25000 simulations, those values (corresponding to the cumulative positive cases, of days) were fitted with a one parameter function of the type of the Gauss Error Function (see section 2) and we then determined the date of the flex with such fitted function for each simulation. Using the fitted function we also determined the date at which the number of daily positive cases will be less than a certain threshold that, for example, we have chosen to be 100 for the diagnosed positive cases. Finally, we calculated the standard deviation of the 25000 simulations. The value of the standard deviation is about one day.",

            "text": "By considering the largely increasing number of daily swabs, from March 26 to April 19, we fitted the ratio of the positive cases to daily swabs using several functions, including the Gaussian, Weibull, Lognormal, Beta and Gamma distributions and a function of the type of the Planck's law, incidentally this last well fits the number of daily positive cases in China. Considering the difficulty in the prediction of the evolution of the number of daily swabs we only marginally analyzed possible fitting functions of the daily swabs, however we considered five possible relevant cases for the number of daily swabs. By considering these five cases and the Gauss and the Planck functions, the range of a substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases goes from April 26 to May 25. By taking the mean number of swabs from February 25 to April 19, we obtained the range April 30 to May 11. By using the mean in the number of daily swabs, from February 25 to March 26 (the period of analysis used in our previous paper), we obtained the range from April 26 to May 2, in agreement with our previous findings. To estimate the uncertainties in these dates, we used 25000 Monte Carlo simulations with the Italian data which provided a random uncertainty of about one day. However, to possibly estimate some of the systematic uncertainties affecting our results, we also used the spread in a substantial reduction of the positive cases of each region below a certain threshold. Using this second method, we found an uncertainty of about 9 days about the mean date, in agreement with the estimates given above by changing the fitting functions of the positive cases per swab and the number of daily swabs.",
