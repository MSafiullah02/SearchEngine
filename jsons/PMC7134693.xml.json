            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) still remains one of the most important causes of death, especially in older adults and those with co-morbid diseases, despite advances in modern medicine [1], [2]. Since CAP is a condition with significant mortality and morbidity, early and effective antimicrobial treatment has been a major focus in clinical practice [1]. Pathogen distribution and antimicrobial resistance in major pathogens in a local setting are very important to select appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of CAP. Major identifiable pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella spp. [1], [2], [3]. However, the distribution of aetiological pathogens of CAP may vary by country. Most of the data on pathogen distribution of CAP have been reported from western countries, whilst only a few data are available in the Asian region [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance in major respiratory pathogens, especially in S. pneumoniae, is another critical point for appropriate treatment of CAP. Previous data by the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) showed that Asian countries have very serious problems of increasing prevalence and level of antimicrobial resistance to penicillin and macrolides in pneumococcal isolates [7], [8].",

To detect M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in all enrolled patients, PLATELIA\u00ae\nM. pneumoniae kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) and C. pneumoniae EIA kit (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) were used according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions, which consist of 96-well microplates using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These were kits for detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM class antibodies. The presence of IgM antibodies allowed the diagnosis of acute infection directly on the first serum sample. If the result of IgM was negative or equivocal, IgG was tested on the first serum (stored after IgM test) and on the second serum (second blood sampling after 8\u201315 days) samples. If the second titre of IgG increased more than twice compared with the first titre, acute infection was confirmed. To detect Legionella pneumophila in all enrolled patients, NOW\u00ae Legionella urinary antigen test (Binax Inc., Scarborough, ME) was used, which is an in vitro rapid immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine specimens from patients with symptoms of pneumonia.",

In vitro resistance to penicillin, macrolides and other antimicrobial agents in pneumococcal isolates from this study was consistent with findings from previous ANSORP studies in Asian countries [7], [8].

Approximately 25% of CAP cases in Asian countries were caused by these atypical pathogens. Interestingly, however, the incidence of CAP caused by Legionella spp. was extremely low (1.1%) in this study. Although the incidence of Legionella pneumonia was low in this study, it has been reported as one of the most common atypical pathogens of CAP around the world [3], [5]. Another important finding from this study was the relatively high incidence of mixed infections by typical bacteria and atypical pathogens. The significance and frequency of mixed infections in CAP, mainly mixed bacterial\u2013viral infections, has been increasingly reported [5]. Although we did not evaluate the viral aetiology in this study, 17% of CAP cases were caused by multiple pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae. This epidemiological finding is important in clinical practice because this type of mixed infection may result in treatment failure of monotherapy with \u03b2-lactam agents. Tuberculosis (TB) was diagnosed in 13 patients, which showed the same clinical presentations as bacterial pneumoniae. TB should be considered the possible cause of CAP, especially in areas where TB is endemic [4], [10].",

According to the recent IDSA/ATS guidelines, macrolides, doxycycline or fluoroquinolones are recommended as a monotherapy option for treating outpatients with CAP [1]. However, macrolides or doxycycline may not be appropriate options for treatment of outpatients with CAP in Asian countries where resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is very prevalent [7]. Also, single use of \u03b2-lactam agents would result in clinical failure if CAP is caused by multiple agents including atypical pathogens. The current study showed that regardless of microorganisms, risk factors and severity of CAP, a combination regimen, especially third-generation cephalosporin + macrolide, is one of the most common regimens used for treatment of patients with CAP in Asian countries.",
