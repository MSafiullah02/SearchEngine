            "text": "Mobile learning has become one of the latest trends in teaching and learning. It is formally defined as the incorporation of various mobile devices into teaching activities (Pereira and Rodrigues 2013). Yet, the possible influence of mobile devices on higher education and their impact on lifelong learning opportunities is still unclear and is an evolving field of study (Kukulska-Hulme 2007). Many educators have considered using mobile devices, such as smartphones, in education due to their affordable, popular and practical functions (Ismail et al. 2013; Pullen et al. 2015). The appeal factor for learning through smartphones and particularly the apps is the ease and flexibility offered by mobile learning which minimizes the barriers provided by traditional methods or activities that used to be carried out in schools and universities (Valk et al. 2010a, 2010b). On the other hand, researchers such as Woodcock et al. (2012a, 2012b) found that mobile phones could be a distraction to students as many of them use their phones more for playing games and other leisure activities than for learning.",

For instance, a study conducted by Pechenkina et al. (2017) positively linked mobile learning and learners\u2019 academic performance. However, learners\u2019 experience in mobile learning was not explored in that study. The study also focused on only one mobile application, making it hard to generalize the findings to other learning environments. On the other hand, a study by Bovermann et al. (2018) suggested that an effective online learning environment should include the factor of gaming as it could result in participants being more motivated in learning and also increase their level of satisfaction. To add to that, Kintu et al. (2017) asserted that for mobile learning to be effective and contribute to learners\u2019 increased academic performance, it has to include other factors such as learners\u2019 interest, learning design and learning outcomes, in which learners\u2019 needs and a proper learning framework have to be prepared. Contrarily, Drew and Mann (2018) held a negative view of mobile learning and the use of interactive mobile application in lessons as they believe it is unfitting, uncomfortable and unacademic concerning the learning experience.",

Higher institutions in Malaysia are encouraged to use technology to assist teaching and learning, and mobile learning has become more prevalent, especially in enhancing language learning. This is seen in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015\u20132025 for higher education where Globalised Online Learning has been outlined as the 9th shift that will spur continued excellence in the higher education system (Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015). However, based on the current observation of language classes in higher institution, the usage of mobile learning is rarely continuous. Rather, it is utilised once in a while to ease information transfer and to attract language learners\u2019 attention to the lessons. There is no proper long-term target of enhancing learners\u2019 proficiency. Though many language instructors are aware of some useful language mobile learning applications that can be used in class, the usage is often limited to the instructor\u2019s familiarity with the applications, ability to fully utilise the applications and the time limitation to conduct mobile activities while covering the syllabus.",

For instance, Kintu et al. (2017) suggested that besides the students\u2019 characteristics, mobile learning design features are good drivers towards an effective blended learning environment. Meanwhile, Barrs (2011) recommended that detailed guidance and explanation on how to use smartphones appropriately in classroom settings is imperative if meaningful learning is to take place. Along the same vein, Chen\u2019s (2013) action research investigated how students used tablet computers for informal language learning and observed their attitudes towards the new mobile technology. It was found that simply providing students with the mobile device did not result in its effective use in language learning. Learners need to be properly guided not only technologically, but also methodologically, as some students lack the necessary knowledge and experience to solve problems in the process of adopting new technologies. Similarly, Ng et al. (2017) found that facilitating the use of smartphone is essential and the findings recommended that future studies should focus on ways to facilitate learners\u2019 intentional behaviour towards the use of smartphones so that they will develop the capacity to use them to assist their learning processes. These findings give raise to questions as to whether mobile learning delivery should be designed in a proper lesson framework in order to be effective for the students.",

Interestingly, research conducted by Sandberg et al. (2011) found that the extra time spent on mobile English learning positively affect students\u2019 learning result. Hence, the second issue that requires further consideration in this research is students\u2019 participation in mobile learning tasks and this can be observed through the time spent in using mobile devices to learn. The importance of including mobile learning time tracking to evaluate students\u2019 achievement has also been suggested by Martin and Ertzberger (2013). A proper study into guided mobile learning intervention especially on the time spent using mobile devices to learn language can be seen as necessary in the context of Malaysian tertiary language learning and in other language learning classrooms in Malaysia, including primary and secondary education and colleges. This is due to the vacuum in the clear understanding on whether guided intervention in mobile learning would be effective in language teaching and learning.",

This change has not only affected students\u2019 learning but also the teaching approaches adopted by teachers. As technology is advancing and becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it has become inseparable from our daily lives. Nowadays, such technological advancements as smartphones and computers have become necessities upon which people are relying to stay socially connected and to access information. Irrefutably, education institutions are among the places where the advancement of technology has taken effect, especially in the classrooms. Students and teachers now have the access to multiple free applications as well as other online learning tools that are useful in enhancing learning. Students and teachers have seen the advances, noticing how technology has expanded the opportunity to study (Navarro 2012). As technological devices are becoming more important, the Internet has assumed a critical role teaching and learning. In schools, for instance, the number of computers inside the classroom continues to increase making the computer the most important tool in school, making the Internet influence a big part of students\u2019 lives (Navarro 2012). The use of technology in education however, has to be well managed and tuned in order to unleash its true potential for positive impact on teaching and learning. Educational technology is not, and never will be, transformative on its own as it requires the assistance of educators who integrate technology into the curriculum, align it with student learning goals, and use it for engaged learning projects (Navarro 2012). Navarro (2012) believed that technology that is effectively integrated into teaching and learning will result in a positive impact on increasing student achievement. Similarly, numerous research projects have been undertaken to investigate students\u2019 preparedness to incorporate learning with mobile devices, some of which are Malaysian-based, including research conducted by Abas et al. (2009), Hussin et al. (2012) and Hamat et al. (2013). The findings report that the respondents in their studies welcomed the integration of learning with mobile gadgets.",

Similarly, Kadirie (2009) defines mobile learning \u201cas a form of e-learning, which can take place anytime, anywhere with the help of a mobile communication device such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), iPod or any such small portable device\u201d (p. 15). Numerous research have found that mobile learning is beneficial and effective in teaching and learning (Ifenthaler and Schweinbenz 2013; Lee et al. 2016; Shohel and Power 2010). Many studies have also mentioned that technology has extensive pedagogical potential to cultivate a better learning environment (Huang et al. 2008; Hwang and Chang 2011). However, most teachers who were incorporating mobile technologies, were still at the initial adoption stage (Ifenthaler and Schweinbenz 2013) and never engaged in extended, and emergent use of mobile learning tools.",

Studies have shown that the use of mobile technologies can enhance learning performance (Bogdanovi\u0107 et al. 2014; Dunn et al. 2013). Pechenkina et al. (2017) whose study focused on correlations of students\u2019 app usage and their academic performance found that there was an increase both in learners\u2019 academic performance and retention rate, against the understanding that learners\u2019 retention rate is suppose to decrease as they progress throughout the semesters. However, the authors focused on only one self-developed mobile application, instead of multiple applications available online, and more importantly, it was purely quantitative, without any attempt to analyse the learners\u2019 learning experience. Previous study, such as by Drew and Mann (2018) focused on the learners\u2019 experience with mobile learning and found using interactive mobile application in lessons to be unfitting, uncomfortable and unacademic. Moreover, the study examined only one application used by the learners. Thus, a study that considers more mobile applications and also explores learner\u2019 experiences with those mobile applications is needed. On a slightly different path, the study by Bovermann et al. (2018), looked into the aspect of both learners\u2019 motivation and learning satisfaction towards gamified online learning. The results point out that there is a significant correlation of gamification and learners\u2019 motivation, and learning satisfaction. The findings of this study therefore suggested a future study in the field of mobile learning for instance, should also take into consideration the factor of gaming in the applications chosen. While studies in the field of blended and mobile learning are done for the purpose of comparing the learning environment and academic achievements, its effectiveness may be contingent on factors such as student characteristics, design features and learning outcomes (Kintu et al. 2017). Thus, it is ideal to understand that, a research on mobile learning should be comprehensive which includes needs analysis, a proper guided mobile learning framework, with the expected learning outcomes.",

Barrs (2011) for instance, claimed that students demonstrate greater interest in continuing self-directed learning using mobile devices when they are provided detailed guidance and explanations on how to use their smartphones appropriately in classroom settings. Upon realizing the usefulness of mobile devices in learning, students are open to the possibility of using their smartphones for educational purposes (White and Mills 2014a, 2014b). This was acknowledged by Gehlen-Baum and Weinberger (2012) who stated that students use their mobile devices for annotating lecture slides, taking notes, looking at lecture-related websites and looking at lecture-related documents. Guided intervention in mobile learning is a concern to be taken into consideration when we talk about blended learning as Geng et al. (2019) implied that teaching presence is critical to the course and facilitation. Teaching presence can be defined as the design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes for the purpose of realizing personally meaningful and worthwhile educational learning outcomes (Anderson et al. 2001). It can therefore be understood that if a blended learning or mobile learning is to be conducted, it has to be well designed, properly guided to achieve the desired outcomes. Thus, having a proper framework for mobile learning in lessons can be said as vital in ensuring its effectiveness and success.",

This means the control group marks were 15 times lower than the experimental group. What is interesting is the possibility that two factors may have contributed to the decline in scores for both groups. One may be that English III is harder for both groups than English II. The other maybe attributed to the likelihood that both groups continued to use Bahasa Malaysia (the first language of the respondents) as their primary language both in and out of school. If that is the case, one could suggest that even though the experimental group had lower post-test scores than their pre-test scores the intervention helped reducing the amount of loss.

This indicates that on an average day, the students spent about 1.9 h engaging in the 6 types of use in their learning. Using smartphone to view PowerPoint presentation and reviewing class notes seem to be the highest use of time among the 6 types of use. This could be due to the reason that in tertiary level of teaching and learning, lecturers use PowerPoint to present their teaching contents. These materials are usually uploaded to the university learning website to be accessed by students either before or after the classes. Thus, it is not a surprise that these 2 types of use top the rest as they are both interrelated. Students would spend time on their smartphone viewing the PowerPoint to review the notes or content delivered by their instructors. In line with this, Raver and Maydosz (2010) found that students who were provided with their instructors\u2019 lecture notes or PowerPoint slides before or after the lecture performed better in a pre-test/post-test comparison than students who were not provided with these aids.",

The results reveal there is a positive significant correlation at p = .000 between post-test mark and mark change. However, there is no significant correlation between post-test mark, mark change and time spent in the activities using smartphone. This implies that the time spent on the activities using smartphone did not show a significant correlation with the students\u2019 post-test marks. Thus, the second research hypothesis of this study is rejected. Treatment group students who spent more time for in using smartphone to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spend minimal time. Previous studies have shown inconclusive results with regard to time spent on e-learning though it has been known as an important contributor to students\u2019 learning and performance (Worthen et al., 1994; Davies and Graff 2005; Romero and Barber\u00e0 2011; Sandberg et al. 2011). In this study, the possibility of such outcome could be explained by the starting point or the pre-test marks which were already high in comparison with the post-test marks. Moreover, comparison could not be made with the control group in terms of their time spend on above activities using the smartphone as they were not included in the intervention. The researchers would suggest future studies to measure the control group in terms of time spent on the above activities using the smartphone without guidance from the instructors.",

The researchers feel that once students were being guided to use the smartphone to engage in learning activities, the more they use the smartphone for purposeful learning, the more they utilized the activities as the types of use are very much interrelated to one and another. Since the six smartphone activities are significantly correlated to each other (see Table 6), it seems responsible to suggest that, given individual learning styles and preference, any one or more of the six activities studied may serve as effective starting points as contributors to increased learning efficiency when appropriate instructional design and intention guide the learner\u2019s smartphone use in the context of learning in a given course experience.",

The urgency to undertake such efforts has been accelerated by the need to suspend face-to-face instruction in response to the life-threatening conditions of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, the longer it is necessary to suspend face-to-face instruction and/or the regularity with which such suspensions must be repeated, should there be a seasonal cycle of COVID-19 as there is with many other viruses, the greater will be the need for universal faculty capacity to design syllabi and provide informed guidance to optimize use of mobile devices for school-related learning.",
