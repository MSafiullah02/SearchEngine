Once the institution makes a commitment, the infection prevention team is formed. This team will ideally consist of at least an infectious diseases\u2013trained medical director and an infection prevention specialist. The next step is to draft policies and/or procedures, creating a framework for the team to enforce CDC and professional society recommendations. Next, we found it useful to perform a census of all practice clinics and settings to ascertain the scope of the services being performed, including which locations perform sterilization and HLD. As in the hospital setting, it is important to perform an initial and yearly infection control risk assessment to identify and prioritize high-risk areas and activities such as injections, infusions, reprocessing of reusable medical devices, and procedures such as vein ablations. Once the risk assessment is complete, a standardized survey tool that incorporates elements of the CDC checklists [5], along with items in the newly created policies, can be utilized to perform a baseline survey to determine areas for improvement and future educational opportunities. A sample checklist can be found in Table 1. Eventually, as the program continues to develop, follow-up surveys are performed. The following sections describe high-priority items and major areas of focus when rolling out an infection prevention program.",

According to the APIC Megasurvey [10], most infection prevention specialists in outpatient clinics spend about 15% of their time on education and research. It is useful to construct a mandatory onboarding orientation that covers standard precautions, hand and respiratory hygiene, injection safety, cleaning/disinfection, and other relevant topics to set up the patient safety culture. A good resource to gather educational materials is the CDC infection control web page [11]. Employees who reprocess instruments and administer injectable medications should complete additional training that incorporates competency evaluation. In order to maintain or update infection prevention knowledge, it is important to administer continuing education through an annual online overview course and annual competency evaluations.",

The absence of routine outcome measures and microbial surveillance perpetuates this attitude. In fact, ambulatory clinics are an extension of hospitals in the continuum of care as patients are typically managed in the outpatient setting, including pre-admission and after discharge. A potential downfall of perceiving the clinic environment as safer than the hospital is illustrated by an outbreak of group A Streptococcus among patients in an outpatient clinic due to ignoring numerous infection prevention practices [12]. The clinic was noted to have lapses in disinfection of multi-use items between patients, glove use, hand hygiene, and in implementing contact precautions. Although the ambulatory setting presents unique challenges, the message remains the same as in the hospital: Practice evidence-based care and implement infection prevention and control strategies to prevent harm, regardless of the setting.",

Examples of interventions that can be effective in increasing compliance include education, just-in-time coaching, and hand hygiene monitoring [14]. After education, selecting which monitoring method will work in an individual clinic is important [15]. Many methods have been applied to measure or improve hand hygiene, including using the patient as an observer [16], installing electronic devices that measure hand hygiene [17], direct observation [14], hand hygiene champions [18], and surveys.",

The best way to prevent airborne droplet exposures in the clinic is to implement airborne isolation precautions [3, 4]. Because most clinics do not have negative pressure rooms, we suggest implementing a modified version of airborne isolation. Key contributors to transmissions were listed in the 1998 article \u201cInfection Control in the Outpatient Setting\u201d [3] and include failure to recognize that isolation is warranted, combined with a lack of airborne isolation rooms. If a patient is known or suspected of having an airborne illness before arriving, it is wise to have a room ready and a back entrance for the patient to enter. A surgical mask should be placed on the patient, and the door to their exam room should remain shut. Health care providers must don N95 masks prior to contact with the patient. Depending upon the air exchange rate for the clinic, after discharge, the room should remain unoccupied for the specified amount of time before reuse [34].",

Also, it has been shown that face masks are able to reduce infectivity [30]; however, in a cross-sectional study on patient mask use, Longtin et al. [36] found that only 27% of patients who were coughing in an emergency room waiting room reported having used a mask. We recommend masking symptomatic children age 5 years or older. In order to improve compliance, frontline desk staff should be trained to ask all patients and visitors with respiratory signs and symptoms and children with a rash to perform hand hygiene and don masks. The staff should also alert the health care workers so that they can move the patient to an exam room promptly.",

A TB control plan and risk assessment should be reviewed and updated annually based on CDC guidelines. Health care worker screening should be performed according to the CDC risk categories [34].
