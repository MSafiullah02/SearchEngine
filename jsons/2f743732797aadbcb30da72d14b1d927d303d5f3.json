            "text": "DURING the last few years, Dr. Waloff and myself have been studying the Euphorine parasites of various Miridae (Heteroptera). The parasites belong to the genus Leiophron Nees (= Euphorus Nees), and their taxonomy is in a confused state. There has been no recent revision, and it is difficult to identify even the British species. When I began to work on the genus I discovered that Dr. M. de V. Graham had seen the types of nearly all the European species and had a manuscript key to them. Although he was too busy to join with me in producing a revision, he has been kind enough to allow me to make full use of his work and to examine some of my specimens so that at least those species on which we have most biological data can be identified or described. The types and paratypes of the two new species have been deposited in the British Museum. The species discussed below are all west European, but specific records are given for those that occur in Britain. Muesebeck (1958) showed that Euphorus Nees, 1834 (type, E. pallicornis Nees, 1834) is a synonym of Leiophron Nees, 1818 (type, L. apicalis Haliday, April, 1833) . L. apicalis is one of the three species originally included when species were first put into Leiophron by Haliday (April, 1833) and was designated as type by Viereck (1914) . Curtis (Nov., 1833) designated L. pallipes Curtis, 1833, as the type,, but this species was not originally included by Haliday, so that the designation is invalid. According to Muesebeck, the species hitherto put in Leiophron (allies of L. ater Nees) should be placed in Centistes Haliday, but this suggestion probably needs further investigation and is not considered here. The subfamily name Euphorinae Forster (1862 : 228) still takes precedence over Liophroninae Forster (1862 : 229). There seem to be some biological grounds for treating the Meteorinae Marshall, 1887, as a distinct subfamily.",

Eggs are laid in the young (rarely older) nymphs, and the full-grown larva emerges from the nearly full-grown nymph or more rarely from the adult. In most British species there is only one generation a year. The British species of Leiophron can be divided into two sections by means of a character first pointed out by C. G. Thomson (1891) .

Haliday (1 835) redescribed Curtis' species in greater detail ; again no specific locality was given, and there is indeed no indication that any additional material had been examined. Marshall (1887 : 58-59) first suggested that picipes of Haliday (put by him in the genus Euphorus) was different from picipes Curtis and stated that the latter is distinguished by its small size, darker legs and impunctate mesoscutum. Unfortunately, he published a new name, Euphorus coactus, for Curtis' rather than Haliday's species; moreover, although this was only a new name, he states that he described it from two females from near Barnstaple.",

            "text": "Curtis states that L. picipes (? female) has 16 antennal segments; Haliday states that the female has 18 antennal segments and that the disk of the mesoscutum is obsoletely punctured. According to Marshall (1887) , picipes Haliday has 16-18 antennal segments in the female and 18 in the male (19-21 in Marshall, 1891 : 8) and the mesoscutum is shining and punctate; coactus Marshall (= picipes Curtis) has 16 antennal segments in the female (16 also in Marshall, 1891 : 12) (male unknown) and the mesoscutum is impunctate. Thomson (1891 : 1748) correctly used Curtis' name for a small species with head and mesoscutum scarcely punctured (female antennae with 16 segments) and split the picipes of Marshall into two species, Euphorus facialis and E. microcerus. All three species were recorded from Sweden. Thomson's treatment seems to be taxonomically correct; moreover, the Haliday specimens of picipes from the National Museum of Ireland belong to Curtis' species and have an unpunctured head and mesoscutum. Marshall's specimens of coactus in the British Museum collection (2 females, Barnstaple) also seem to belong to L. picipes, although they are rather small, the legs are not very dark, and in spite of Marshall's statement, the mesoscutum has some obsolescent punctures. Marshall's series in the same collection of what he called picipes is a mixture of L. microcerus (Thomson) (1 male) and L. facialis (Thomson) (5 males). Marshall (1897 : 204) disagrees with Thomson and repeats his earlier statements but does not mention any further specimens. The only specimens of L. picipes that I have seen are four males and three females from Haliday's collection in the National Museum of Ireland and one male and one female from Silwood Park, Berks. The data are as follows: 4 6 (2 on one mount) 3 9 (Haliday coll ., labelled picipes Curtis by Mr. A. W. Stelfox); Berks., Silwood Park, on young broom, 1 .v. 58, 1 6 (0. W.

The species appears to be a parasite of species of Psallus, but the oak-living bugs are often blown off on to the broom and may stay there for a long time.
