            "text": "For decades, the genetic modifi cation of coronavirus genomes and the generation of recombinant coronaviruses have been hampered mostly due to the extraordinary large size of the coronaviral genome. The very fi rst reverse genetic system for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) was established in the early 2000s; the respective approach exclusively enabled the manipulation of the 3\u2032-third of the viral genome. Later on, vaccinia virus-and bacterial artifi cial chromosome (BAC)-based systems have been developed. Both systems have the advantage that the entire FCoV genome is amenable for mutagenesis. The main focus of this chapter is the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system for FCoVs. Here we present protocols for (1) the generation of a full-length cDNA clone, (2) the manipulation of the FCoV genome, and (3) the rescue of recombinant FCoVs.",

            "text": "The establishment of a reverse genetic system for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), which allows to modify the entire coronaviral genome, was successfully achieved for the fi rst time in 2008 [ 1 ] . This system relies on vaccinia virus, which serves as a cloning vector for the full-length FCoV cDNA. The very fi rst vaccinia virusbased reverse genetic system was developed for the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229 E [ 2 ] and since then it has been successfully applied for other coronaviruses, e.g., infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [ 3 ] or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [ 4 ] . The major advantage of the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system lies in the stable integration of full-length corona viral cDNAs into the vaccinia virus genome. In contrast, other conventional cloning techniques often are not suitable for the accommodation of large coronaviral cDNA inserts due to instability of the plasmids caused by certain coronaviral sequences. However, reverse genetic systems, which are based on different techniques other than vaccinia virus, have been developed and used successfully for the generation of various recombinant coronaviruses [ 5 -11 ] .",

We experienced that exposing the DNA to UVlight can hamper the ligation of these fragments into the vaccinia virus genome. To assess the exact position of a DNA band without damaging it with UV-light, load DNA marker on both sides of your digested fragment on the agarose gel. After electrophoresis, separate the lanes with the marker from the remaining part (contains the digested fragments) of the gel. Using UV-light, cut out a small piece in each of the marker lanes at the expected height of the digested product. Position these lanes back together with the part containing the digested fragment. Cut the agarose gel between the two indicated positions in order to remove the agarose slice with the digested fragment.",

For the optimal separation of the bands a 1 % agarose gel should be prepared. The gel runs for approximately 18 h (switch time 3-30 s, angle 120\u00b0, voltage 6 V/cm). The set up can vary depending on the system used for PFGE . 7. The conditions for the electroporation depend on the cell line and device used for the electroporation.

( a ) The nearly 30 kb long FCoV genome, which is divided into seven parts (A, AB-1, AB-2, AB-3, B, C, and D), is depicted. Plasmids A, B, C, and D (pA, pB, pC, and pD) are shown. The detailed descriptions of the 5 \u2032end of fragment A and the 3\u2032 end of fragment D in pA and pD are shown, respectively. In pA the FCoV sequence is preceded by a Bsp120I recognition site ( underlined ), T7 DNA -dependent RNA polymerase promoter (T7), and a G nucleotide. In pD the FCoV sequence is followed by poly-A sequence (A n30 ), ClaI cleavage site, hepatitis delta ribozyme (HDR) sequence, and a Bsp120I recognition site ( underlined ). ( b ) Fragments A, B, C, and D ( purple boxes ) derived from plasmids pA, pB, pC, and pD are ligated to obtain fragment ABCD. The overhangs of the Bsp120I recognition sites, which enable the ligation into the NotI cleaved vaccinia virus DNA, are shown in purple . In a further step, fragment ABCD is ligated into the vaccinia virus (VV) genome ( pink boxes ). The overhangs originating from the NotI cleavage site in the vaccinia virus DNA and the Bsp120I sites from fragment ABCD are depicted in pink and purple , respectively 3. Analyze the effi ciency of your ligation on an agarose gel after heating up the samples for 5-10 min at 65 \u00b0C. If the result of the ligation is not satisfying, repeat the small-scale ligation with different ratios of the fragments. If the desired ligation product can be observed, proceed to the next step.4. Use the same conditions as in step 3 for a large-scale ligation. Load the entire reaction on agarose gel and purify the desired ligation product using a gel extraction kit, which enables the effi cient recovery of cDNAs larger than 15 kb. For the excision of the band avoid the use of UV-light ( see Note 1 ). Use this purifi ed product for the ligation with the NotI digested vaccinia virus DNA in order to integrate the FCoV cDNA into the vaccinia virus genome (section \"Integration of the FCoV cDNA into the Vaccinia Virus Genome via In Vitro Ligation\")(Fig. 1b ).For the following experiment the vaccinia virus strain vNotI / tk is used. This vaccinia virus genome contains only a single NotI cleavage site, which enables the introduction of the FCoV cDNA into the vaccinia virus genome via in vitro ligation. 1.

The IVT reaction contains the following components in 50 \u03bcl: \u03bcl RNase-free DNase to the reaction and incubate for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. 7. Precipitate the RNA using 27 \u03bcl LiCl and incubate the reaction at \u221220 \u00b0C for at least 30 min. 8. Spin the reaction (13,000 RPM, 4 \u00b0C, 20 min) in order to pellet the RNA. 9. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 500 \u03bcl 70 % ethanol. 10. Resolve the pellet in 20 \u03bcl RNase-free water and analyze 2 \u03bcl of it on an agarose gel. This RNA can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or directly used for the electroporation (Sect. 3.3.2 ). However, it is recommended to use the RNA immediately for the electroporation. 1. Use for the electroporation an inducible Crfk-Tet/On cell line, which expresses the FCoV N protein. 2. Induce the cells in a 10 cm dish 20-24 h prior electroporation with doxycycline. 3. Trypsinize the cells 20-24 h after induction, pellet (2000 RPM, 4 \u00b0C, 3 min) and wash the cells twice with 10 ml of ice cold PBS. 4. Count the cells, pellet again (2000 RPM, 4 \u00b0C, 3 min) and resuspend the pellet in PBS to obtain 1 \u00d7 10 6 to 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells in 800 \u03bcl. 5. Transfer the 800 \u03bcl into a 4 mm gap electroporation cuvette. 6. Add the FCoV RNA (Sect. 3.3.1 ) to the cells and mix gently. 7. Electroporate the RNA with one pulse using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) (Resistance: \u221e, high-capacity: 950 \u03bcF, 0.18 kV) ( see Note 7 ).",
