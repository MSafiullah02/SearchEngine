Automated systems have the advantage of collecting data noninvasively with reduced labor input. Feeding and lying behavior have been shown to change in response to sickness (Svensson and Jensen, 2007; Borderas et al., 2008; Szyszka and Kyriazakis, 2013) and pain (Graf and Senn, 1999; Heinrich et al., 2010) in calves. Hence, automated measures of feeding and lying behavior could potentially be used to detect early signs of disease and pain in calves.",

Once an animal displays clinical signs of NCD, much of the associated tissue damage to the intestinal submuscosa has already occurred (Schroeder et al., 2012); therefore, early detection of NCD would enable calves to be promptly treated and moved to sick pens thereby reducing tissue damage and risk of disease transmission to other calves. Previous studies using ACFS and accelerometers have reported changes in feeding (Svensson and Jensen, 2007; Borderas et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2016) and lying behavior (Swartz et al., 2017) in response to NCD and respiratory disease. However, those studies predominantly focused on changes in behavior once calves became clinically ill or the time period just prior (Svensson and Jensen, 2007; Borderas et al., 2009), or calves that were diagnosed with respiratory disease (Swartz et al., 2017). To our knowledge, no studies have measured changes in feeding in conjunction with lying behavior in calves before diagnosis with NCD. It would be valuable to measure changes in feeding and lying behavior concurrently, several days before calves become clinically ill, to assess if information collected from ACFS and accelerometers could be used for early detection of NCD on-farm.",

Disbudding is often performed without pain relief; however, studies have shown that this procedure causes behavioral changes indicative of pain (reviewed by Stafford and Mellor, 2011). For example, calves spent less time feeding and more time lying after being cautery disbudded than sham-handled controls (Graf and Senn, 1999; Faulkner and Weary, 2000). Therefore, a need exists to evaluate different pain-mitigation strategies to alleviate the pain caused by disbudding; to do this, however, labor-intensive behavioral studies are often needed. It would be useful if automated measures of feeding and lying behavior were sensitive enough to detect behavioral changes in calves in response to a painful procedure such as disbudding. Automated measures of feeding and lying behavior could then be used as a research tool to evaluate different pain-mitigation strategies for painful husbandry procedures in calves.",

Health checks assessed calves for the presence of diarrhea, high rectal temperatures (39.5\u00b0C or higher), signs of dehydration (sunken eyes, or poor skin elasticity\u2014assessed using the skin tent test), coat condition (shiny and smooth vs. dry and rough), position of the ears (erect vs. droopy), gut fill (full vs. empty stomachs), signs of navel ill (inflammation, swelling, or discharge from the navel), nasal or ocular discharge, swelling, abscesses, and injury. Trained staff were also asked to comment if calves were coughing, had crackly breaths, or were breathing fast. In the present study, calves were diagnosed as having NCD when they presented with diarrhea and high rectal temperatures (39.5\u00b0C or higher). A calf was considered to have diarrhea if it was observed passing feces with a loose to watery consistency and strong odor. For calves suspected of having diarrhea due to the presence of loose fecal matter on the top of the tail or hind legs, a fecal sample was taken to evaluate fecal consistency and to confirm whether or not that particular calf was diarrheic. Only data collected from calves diagnosed as having NCD were considered as sick calves for further analysis. Once calves exhibited signs of NCD, blood and fecal samples were collected for analysis to verify etiology of the disease. It is possible that any of the calves could have been experiencing subclinical disease during the course of the study, but it was beyond the scope of this study to test all animals for the presence of subclinical diseases; hence, animals were categorized as sick or healthy based on clinical signs of illness only. Calf BW was recorded weekly.",

Each ACFS had a single teat to deliver whole milk (at approximately 22\u201325\u00b0C) on the following schedule: 2 L, 3 times per day with a minimum 360-min period with no milk access between each complete milk feed (as per normal farm practice in New Zealand). If the calf did not consume the whole 2 L during the visit, they could return at any point to consume the remainder of the allowance. The ACFS recorded the total number of visits, rewarded visits (calf received part or whole milk allowance), unrewarded visits (calf received no milk), and milk volume consumed per visit.",

The accelerometers were placed in a durable fabric pouch and strapped onto the lateral side of the hind leg above the metatarsophalangeal joint. Accelerometers were placed horizontally on the leg such that the x-axis ran parallel to the ground, pointing in the anterior direction, and the y-axis pointing toward the dorsal plane of the calf. The pouch was held in position using velcro patches, one sewn to the pouch, the other glued (KAMAR, Livestock Improvement Corporation, Hamilton, New Zealand) to the leg of the calf. The pouch was further held in place by a strap around the leg of the calf. Accelerometers were initialized and downloaded using Onset HOBOware Pro software (Onset Computer Corporation, version 3.7.2). The G-force readings were converted into binary values (e.g., lying = 0, standing = 1), and hourly (min/h) and daily (min/d) summaries of lying time and lying bout frequency (number of bouts/d) were calculated in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) using a code designed for this purpose (AWP UBC, 2016) and validated by Bonk et al.

The combination of pain relief treatments were included to evaluate whether the automated systems were sensitive enough to measure varying degrees of pain. All calves were restrained in a calf crush with a head bail (Front Opening Calf Bail, Te Pari, Oamaru, New Zealand) during treatments. For DB, LA+DB, NSAID+DB, and LA+NSAID+DB calves, an electric cautery iron (Quality electric debudder, 230 V, 190 W; Lister GmbH, L\u00fcdenscheid, Germany) was used to remove the calves horn buds. For LA+DB and LA+NSAID+DB calves, 3 mL of local anesthetic (2% lignocaine hydrochloride; Lopaine, Ethical Agents Ltd., Auckland, NZ) was injected into the cornual nerve (3 mL) and 5 injection sites around the base of the horn bud (0.2 mL/site) 5 min before disbudding. Immediately before disbudding, a needle prick test was used to verify the success of the cornual nerve block. For NSAID+DB- and LA+NSAID+DB-treated calves, meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg of BW; Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd., Auckland, NZ) was injected subcutaneously 5 min before disbudding. Treatment groups were balanced for age and BW. Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h before and 24 h after administration of treatment, as described above.",

Inc.). The residuals from the log-transformed mixed model analysis showed good consistency with the normality assumptions of the model. For the calf health component of our study, data from calves that were identified with NCD were used (see description above). Each calf with NCD was matched with a healthy control from the same pen taking into account sex, breed, birth date, and birth weight. Healthy controls never presented with any symptoms of NCD or other signs of illness or injury during the study period. Day 0 was the day that calves showed signs of NCD and the equivalent day was used for d 0 for control calves. We were interested in behavioral changes leading up to signs of NCD; therefore, we focused on the 5 d before appearance of NCD. Milk consumption, blood chemistry and hematology data were log-transformed to meet the assumptions of the analysis. Milk consumption and lying (lying times and frequency of lying bouts) behavior data were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of SAS. The model included the fixed effects of treatment (health status: NCD and healthy), day, treatment by day interaction, and the random effects of pen and calf. The model had a repeated structure on time allowing incorporation of heterogeneity of variances across time. For blood chemistry and hematology (cells counts and haptoglobin concentrations) data, only the blood results from d 0 were compared; the model included the fixed effects of treatment (health status: NCD and healthy) and the random effect of pen.

Differences in the number of unrewarded visits was apparent 2 d before calves showed signs of NCD; however, we found no change in the number of rewarded visits before diagnosis. Similarly, Svensson and Jensen (2007) found that the number of unrewarded visits was a more sensitive measure of sickness in calves than the number of rewarded visits. Borderas et al. (2009) suggested that the effect of disease on feeding behavior would vary according to feeding motivation, as milk intake and frequency of visits to the feeder were more dramatically decreased in sick calves being fed a high (ad libitum or 12 L/d) rather than a low (4 L/d) milk allowance. In the present study, calves received a milk allowance of 6 L/d, which is closer to the low than the high milk allowance provided in the Borderas et al. (2009) study; hence, more dramatic changes in feeding behavior may have been observed if a higher milk allowance was provided to calves in the present study. Therefore, milk allowance fed to calves needs to be taken into consideration when using behavioral data from ACFS as an indication of NCD in calves.",

Hence, milk consumption in combination with the number of unrewarded visits maybe a good measure for early detection of NCD in calves. Differences in feeding behavior among studies may relate to the pathogenesis of the disease. In other studies, calves were diagnosed with a range of illnesses, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, or a combination of these diseases (Borderas et al., 2009; Swartz et al., 2017), or other signs of disease such as arthritis, fever, dull calf syndrome, and so on (Svensson and Jensen, 2007). However, in those studies, samples were not taken to verify the pathogenesis of the diseases. In our study, only calves that were diagnosed as having NCD were used; however, even with fecal sampling we could only confirm the cause of NCD in 7 out of 18 calves. Therefore, due to the differences in the pathogenesis affecting calves among our study and previous studies, it is difficult to know the reason for the difference in results. In addition to pathogenesis, age of calves at the time of diagnosis, severity of outbreak, and the time of diagnosis could potentially affect feeding and lying behavior in calves. Further research focused on particular pathogens or disease severity would be of interest to assist in our understanding of the relationship between pathogenesis and sickness behavior in calves.",

A reduction in activity of sick calves may be part of the adaptive strategy adopted by mammals to help combat infections (Hart, 1988). However, on the day calves were diagnosed as having NCD in the present study their lying times were reduced. At the time calves were diagnosed with NCD, blood and fecal samples were collected and animals were moved to the sick pen and treated with electrolytes; this extra handling may account for the reduction in lying times.",

            "text": "In the present study, disbudding treatment affected the total number of visits that calves made to the feeder during the 24-h posttreatment period. This difference was predominantly due to the number of unrewarded visits as disbudding treatment did not affect the number of rewarded visits. Calves experiencing the SHAM treatment performed more unrewarded visits during the 24-h posttreatment period than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves. The greater number of unrewarded visits suggests that even though there was no difference in the amount of milk consumed among treatments, calves that were not disbudded were more motivated to visit the ACFS than calves disbudded with LA or NSAID or without pain relief. Fewer unrewarded visits to the ACFS by disbudded calves could reflect a lack of appetite in these animals due to the pain or distress caused by disbudding. Indeed, calves spent less time feeding after cautery disbudding (Graf and Senn, 1999) and amputation dehorning (Sutherland et al., 2013). It is also possible that disbudding caused the calves in the present study to become head shy and, hence, more hesitant to place their heads in the ACFS due to the potential risk of knocking their head in the confined space. Another possibility is that experiencing a painful husbandry procedure caused a change in the emotional state of the animals, which may in turn have affected their motivation to feed (Neave et al., 2013). Interestingly, calves given local anesthetic and an NSAID before disbudding in the present study performed a similar number of unrewarded visits as SHAM calves, which suggests that the combination of LA and an NSAID was the most effective pain-mitigation strategy evaluated in the present study. These results are in accordance with previous studies showing that the physiological and behavioral response to disbudding is markedly reduced when calves are given a combination of LA and an NSAID before disbudding (Duffield et al., 2010; Heinrich et al., 2010).",

(2015) found that when calves were given the same milk allowance as provided in the present study (6 L/d), mean cumulative milk consumption over the 11-d postdisbudding period was greater for calves disbudded with pain relief compared with those without. Therefore, it is possible that if milk consumption had been recorded for a longer period of time in the present study, treatment differences may have been detected. Furthermore, milk allowance is an important factor to consider when using total milk consumption as an indicator of stress (e.g., pain or disease). Borderas et al. (2009) found that sick calves consumed less milk at an ACFS when provided with a high milk allowance in comparison to healthy calves, but total milk consumption was not affected when they were provided with a low milk allowance. Calves provided only a low milk allowance are more likely to be motivated to feed. In the present study, calves were given access to 6 L/d, whereas calves given ad libitum access to milk will drink up to 10 kg/d (Jasper and Weary, 2002). Therefore, providing calves with a higher milk allowance is likely to increase the sensitivity of feeding behavior as a measure of stress (e.g., pain and disease) in calves.",

During the first hour after disbudding, calves given local anesthetic showed similar lying patterns to control-handled calves, which is similar to the results reported by McMeekan et al. (1999) 2 h after amputation dehorning. These findings may suggest that calves given local anesthetic were experiencing less pain initially than calves disbudded without pain relief. Moreover, calves given only an NSAID before disbudding showed similar lying times to calves disbudded without pain relief, which corresponds to the mechanism of action of NSAID; giving an NSAID (e.g., ketoprofen) reduces the inflammation-related pain associated with amputation dehorning in cattle, but not the initial pain caused by dehorning (McMeekan et al., 1998).These results suggest that lying behavior measured using accelerometer data loggers maybe sensitive enough to assess pain in calves in response to an acute painful procedure such as cautery disbudding.",
