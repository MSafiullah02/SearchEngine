Over two-thirds of patients with a hematologic malignancy develop anemia [1], with the highest prevalence in children with leukemia (over 97%) and lymphoma (over 93%) [2]. The transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is a balance between the benefits of maintaining oxygen delivery and the inherent risks from blood transfusion. We have previously published reviews of blood transfusion practices in adults [3] and in the elderly [4]; and here, we update blood transfusion therapy in adults and children. We summarize the pathophysiology of anemia in this setting, indications for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, current blood risks, special situations in RBC transfusion, and alternative or adjunct therapy for anemia management such as erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron therapy. Where possible, we provide evidence-based guidelines for best practices.",

Several potential risks must be considered when a biologic family member wishes to serve as a directed donor to a child who may later need a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a family member, including TRALI and RBC and HLA alloimmunization. These risks should be adequately explained to families wishing to proceed with directed donation. In addition, the practitioner must discuss cost, timing of donation, and special needs of the patient such as ABO/Rh blood type compatibility and CMV seronegative status, which may not be met by the directed donor/family member.

Traditionally, children with gradual onset of severe anemia should be transfused at a slow rate (i.e. 1 ml/kg/h) to prevent transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). A recent randomized clinical trial showed that in 43 children without evidence of cardiac failure with severe anemia, none developed signs of circulatory overload with RBC transfusion at rates of 1 ml/kg/h or 3 ml/kg/h [47].

Symptomatic manifestations occur only when the Hb is below two-thirds of normal (i.e., less than 9 to 10 g/dl) as basal cardiac output increases in the anemic patient and is manifested clinically by symptoms of increased cardiac work [53]. The historical practice was to correct moderate anemia with red blood cell transfusions in order to treat these signs and symptoms or to transfuse blood prophylactically. Subsequently, reflected in one publication that stated \u2018when the concentration of hemoglobin is less than 8 to 10 g/dl, it is wise to give a blood transfusion before operation\u2019 [54].",

While even moderate chronic anemia is well tolerated by some patients, interval increases in hemoglobin lead to decreased fatigue and improvements in quality of life in adults [93]. ESAs were considered a safe therapeutic option to improve functional status as they were shown to reduce transfusion requirement and improve response. In early 2000s, however, studies began to show that ESA therapy in experimental trials designed to target normal or high-normal hemoglobin levels, were linked to tumor progression and shortened survival [24]. Later trials failed to confirm these detrimental effects and potentially showed a survival benefit [93], [94]. A large meta-analysis concluded that ESA therapy increased the baseline rate of thrombosis present in cancer patients. The use of ESA versus RBC transfusion in selected cancer patients such as those with chronic kidney disease and those on palliative treatment continues under a FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation and Strategy [5]. Current risk mitigation strategies include using ESA therapy only for patients with hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl [95]. Anemia can and should be treated at higher Hgb levels if there are available alternative to RBC that are safer.",

            "text": "In children, there are few randomized studies on the use of ESAs to prevent or treat cancer associated anemia. These studies are difficult to interpret given most have small patient cohorts, variable patient populations, variable study designs and treatment dosing. Shankar reviewed nine randomized trials in pediatrics and concluded that the role of ESAs in treatment or prevention of anemia in children with cancer remains unclear [96]. The existing pediatric data suggests that use of ESAs can significantly decrease the need for RBC transfusions and side effects are mild. However, there are no data to show improvement of quality of life or cost-effectiveness of ESAs and their potential role in promoting cancer cells' growth remains a significant concern in children.",
