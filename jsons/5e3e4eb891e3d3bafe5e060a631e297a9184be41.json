The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 emergency to be the sixth public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 [5] . According to the report on 24 March 2020, the total number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 was 372,757 cases, with 16,231 deaths in 170 countries/regions; among these, 123 cases have been reported in Vietnam [6, 7] . COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020 [8] . Treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 are currently in development. Therefore, prevention and supportive care are highly recommended [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , especially in countries with weaker healthcare systems, as suggested by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus [14] . Vitally, intense surveillance is emphasized to prevent the sustained transmission in new locations [15] . The public health response to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has been initiated at different levels in all countries affected [16] .",

            "text": "The most important finding of the current study was that people with S-COVID-19-S had a higher likelihood of depression and lower HRQoL. Fortunately, those people having S-COVID-19-S and with higher HL had a low occurrence of depression and better HRQoL compared to those people with lower HL. Health literacy was found to be a protective factor for improving depression and HRQoL during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially for those who have S-COVID-19-S. To improve health literacy and control the disease and its consequences during the outbreak, governments must firstly recognize COVID-19 as an emergency public health concern [5] , and find the balance between public health and civil liberties [57] , as well as cultural sensitivity [58] . The government needs to provide the public with updated, timely, accurate, transparent, brief, simple information and knowledge regarding the epidemic, pathogenicity, and transmissibility which help with better controlling the disease [58, 59] . In Vietnam, the leaders of the government have been leading the government in actions against COVID-19 directly [60] . The healthcare and public health communities and global and domestic public health preparedness capacity buildings need to be sustained and strengthened in order to effectively respond to the epidemic [61, 62] . The ministry of health of Vietnam has been directing all healthcare institutions at all levels and collaborating with other sectors to communicate with the public, in order to prevent and control the disease [7] . These messages apply for every government, especially in Vietnam, a country with the lowest HL level among all studied Asian countries [29, 30] . The main reason for the low HL level may be linked with accessibility of reliable information. Therefore, it is critical for the government and the ministry of health to provide accessible platforms with official and reliable information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it is suggested that people should enhance their life-long learning behaviors (e.g., watching health-related television programs, reading official websites) to improve individual health literacy [63] . The above may further contribute to preventing and controlling infectious diseases [64, 65] .",

Going to work and/or taking care of children during the pandemic creates a burden of stress which further affects their HRQoL, as found in the current study. Therefore, people with education at college/university level or above had slightly lower HRQoL as compared to those with high school levels of education [71] . Nevertheless HRQoL was still higher in people with higher levels of educational attainment in the current study and in the previous one [68] . Furthermore, people who had ever married had lower HRQoL. Logically, people who had their own businesses had better HRQoL than those who employed. In addition, participants with middle or high social status had a lower likelihood of depression and better HRQoL. People with higher social status are likely wealthier. The present study demonstrates that people with a better ability to pay for medication had better HRQoL. Similarly, previous studies have shown that higher income is positively associated with higher HRQoL in the general population [68, 71] .",
