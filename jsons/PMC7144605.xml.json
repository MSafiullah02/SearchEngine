In late December 2019, an earlier named novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), currently named as coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged from Wuhan, China, resulted in a challenging outbreaks in many regions in China and expanding globally. Human infections with coronavirus COVID-19 have raised great public health apprehension globally. In the third millennium, three major threatening infectious diseases outbreaks happened. Following the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 (Zhong et al., 2003) and the MERS-CoV in 2012 (Nassar et al., 2018a, Nassar et al., 2018b), the novel Coronavirus \u201cCOVID-19\u201d has emerged globally and has threatened the entire world. The coronaviruses are zoonotic infections, can be transmitted from animal to animal, animal to human, and human to human (Li et al., 2020, World Health Organization, 2020a, World Health Organization, 2020b).",

The biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality rate are changing daily. Initially, China bears the large burden of the diseases, whereas the incidence is gradually increasing in other countries mainly the Europe and United States of America.

We have derived the estimates of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic and found that still the mean growth factor for number of cases and mortality rate is more than 1.0. It is highly contagious because of its biological characteristics (Meo et al., 2020). It is a zoonotic disease with person-to-person transmission through droplet or contact transmission (Wu et al., 2020). Infected people can transmit the disease before they present clinical symptoms (Rothe et al., 2020). This is the main reason that the disease could swiftly spread from Wuhan, China to various corners of the globe. More recently, the epicenter of the diseases appears to have shifted from Wuhan, China to the European world and mainly Italy, and United States of America (World Health Organization, 2020a, World Health Organization, 2020b). Many countries including China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, France have cancelled international flights and implemented the world's largest and most restrictive quarantines policies to minimize the further transmission and disease burden. For the prevention of the spread of the disease, these countries are not permitting people to enter or leave the country without strict screening of the passenger for Covid-2019 infection at airports.",

The authors found that effectiveness of entry screening was dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening at the destination. The authors identified that 46% of the infected travelers were not detected, because of the incubation period, and asymptomatic or subclinical cases (Chan et al., 2020). (Quilty et al., 2020) also reported that airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of COVID-19 infected travelers. The screening is intended to be a barrier for preventing infected people from entering into the country; however, evidence of its effectiveness remains limited. These are reasons that health officials are still unable to control the spread of this contagious disease. The transmission of the disease is closely linked to the asymptomatic and infected people and those visiting the countries with COVID-19 pandemic.",
