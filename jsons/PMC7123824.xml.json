            "text": "Immunoglobulin therapy has been used for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease before the introduction of antimicrobial agents into the clinical practice. In the early 1890s, Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato set the basis of \u201c serum therapy\u201d showing that antibody preparations derived from the serum of immunized animals have the ability to protect against bacterial toxins [115]. Ehrlich\u2019s subsequent work contributed to the conception of passive immunity, demonstrating that increasing doses of bacterial toxins could provide immunity against lethal doses of toxin [68]. Cenci first used human serum in 1907 for the prevention of measles and thereafter for the prevention of pertussis and mumps [45]. Systemic administration of \u201cserum therapy\u201d was widely used in the 1930s for the treatment of bacterial and viral infections; however its use was often associated with adverse reactions due to administration of large amounts of animal proteins, ranging from fever and chills to \u201cserum sickness,\u201d a form of immune complex disease, characterized by rash, proteinuria, and arthralgias [45]. After improvements in antibody purification methods, which reduced serum toxicity, the role of \u201cserum therapy\u201d was further expanded. In the pre-antibiotic era, serum therapy significantly reduced the mortality in some infectious outbreaks such as meningococcal and meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, and diphtheria. The efficacy of serum therapy varied with the type and severity of the infections and the timing of treatment administration in relation to symptom onset [27, 28, 43]. For some infections like whooping cough, anthrax, dysentery (Shigella dysenteriae), and gas gangrene, the efficacy of \u201cserum therapy\u201d was uncertain, while for other pathogens like Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, and Salmonella species, no consistently effective sera were produced [28].",

The initial interest in using combination therapies with antibiotics and serum was abandoned, as the potential benefits were marginal. Antimicrobial chemotherapy proved to be less toxic and more effective than serum therapy in the treatment of infections. However, Dr. Cohn\u2019s discovery of purified antibodies through cold ethanol fractionation of plasma during the Second World War revived the interest in antibody treatment especially for infections not able to be treated with antibiotics. The fractionation procedure stabilizes the product, denatures most viruses, and assures a more uniform antibody content. Cohn fraction (IgG from plasma after cold alcohol fractionation) was initially used for prophylaxis against prevalent and life-threatening infections, such as measles. It was not until 1952 that Bruton reported for the first time the use of immunoglobulin preparation injected subcutaneously for the treatment of a young boy with agammaglobulinemia [21]. Thereafter, the use of immunoglobulin injected intramuscularly became established as the standard therapy for primary immunodeficiencies, lasting until the development of purer and safer intravenous immunoglobulin preparation in the early 1980s [86].",

            "text": "The advent of hybridoma technology, which allows continuous generation of large quantities of monoclonal antibodies specific to antigens of interest and the generation of humanized antibodies, revolutionized antibody therapeutics [63]. Monoclonal antibody technology offers supply advantage, reduces the risks of adverse events, and decreases lot-to-lot variation. In the mid-1980s a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD3 was introduced into clinical practice to prevent organ rejection. Almost a decade later, the humanized mAb palivizumab ( Synagis\u00ae, a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV pulmonary infections in high-risk patients, especially infants) was licensed. Palivizumab was 50-fold more potent than the polyclonal product, resulting in reduced volume of administration and intramuscular use [45]. During the last three decades, 30 therapeutic mAbs have been licensed, mainly for treatment of malignancies and rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, but only two were licensed for infectious diseases (palivizumab and raxibacumab: human mAb to anthrax toxin). Although the use of mAbs to treat infectious diseases does not depend on discrimination between self-antigen as there are large antigenic differences between the microorganism and the host, the pace of discovery and development of new mAbs against infectious disease is limited. Currently, the areas of mAbs development have been focused on viral diseases without available vaccines [HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, Marburg virus], viral disease with limited effective antiviral drugs (influenza, rabies), and bacterial toxin-mediated disease (anthrax, Clostridium difficile colitis). In the clinical setting, therapeutic mAbs can be used when there are nosocomial/iatrogenic outbreaks. For example, a new approach to the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection is the administration of mAbs against C. difficile toxins (in addition to antibiotic therapy) as a form of passive immunity. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies that bind and neutralize C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial showed that a single intravenous dose of bezlotoxumab when given with standard-of-care antibiotics provided protection against recurrent C. difficile infection for up to 12 weeks that was superior to that provided by treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics alone [114]. Other therapeutic mAbs can be applied in drug resistance (Staphylococcus aureus, VRSA), pandemic outbreaks (Ebola virus), bioterrorism attacks (Bacillus anthracis), emerging infectious diseases (Nipah or Hendra virus), and use in high-risk host groups or in severe diseases (respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV patients, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus). Another application of therapeutic mAbs concerns their use as adjunct therapies that have anti-inflammatory or immune modulatory roles (mAbs against TNF-\u03b1 and other immune mediators) [45, 55].",

This results in receptor clustering, recruitment of secondary effector functions, and subsequent activation of signaling pathways, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and cell activation. By comparison, high concentrations of IgG have anti-inflammatory properties. The mechanisms proposed for this mode of action are modulation of the expression and function of Fc\u03b3Rs, interference with activation of the complement cascade and the cytokine network, neutralization of autoantibodies, and regulation of cell proliferation [38].",

IVIG is used in the treatment of primary and secondary antibody deficiencies, many immunoregulatory disorders (e.g., immune thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease), and neurologic disorders (e.g., Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, peripheral neuritis). IGSC is used exclusively for the antibody deficiencies.",

Opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibody content varies with each product batch, primarily due to differences in the local pathogen ecology of donor exposure. IgG and complement proteins are the principal classes of opsonins contributing to bacterial clearance. In addition to IgG, varying amounts of immunoglobulin isotypes, especially IgA, can be found in the IVIG preparation. Regarding the different human IgG subclasses (IgG1-IgG4), IVIG preparations reflect the hierarchy present in the serum, consisting mainly of IgG1 and IgG2 and containing much smaller amounts of the other IgG subclasses. Only the product Pentaglobin\u00ae (Biotest, Germany) is IgM-enriched [93]. The clinical use of IVIG can be distinguished by the infused amount [92]. The principal manufacturing process in all current IgG preparations is cold ethanol fractionation with product-specific additional processes for manufacturing. The commonest processes for virus reduction include solvents/detergent, low pH (pH 4), incubation, nanofiltration, and chromatography [93]. Other major quality control practices in the production process, besides viral reduction, include the depletion of blood coagulation factors and the removal of IgG aggregates, since these aggregates could result in a cytokine release syndrome owing to the ubiquitous activation of innate immune effector cells via activating Fc\u03b3Rs. IgG aggregations are absent from the majority of IVIG preparation; however, depending on the provider and batch, up to 1\u201310% of IgG can be found in dimeric form in most IVIG preparations [92].",

Over 80% of all PIDD involve antibody-mediated immunity; however, each individual disorder has a different immunopathogenesis in terms of the number of B cells in the blood and B-cell function. Moreover, any persisting endogenous antibody production varies both between specific conditions and within individual disorders [10, 35, 97]. Table 17.5 describes the PIDD for which immunoglobulin replacement is or may be efficacious. The recommendations for immunoglobulin replacement treatment in primary and secondary immune deficiencies are shown in Table 17.6 [32, 84, 97]. The main indications are primary antibody deficiencies including agammaglobulinemia (autosomal recessive or X-linked) and common variable immunodeficiency disorders. Rarely, other antibody deficiencies, such as IgG subclass deficiency, may be managed by immunoglobulin replacement. In these immunodeficiencies, a trial of 12 months may be indicated if there is a substantial infection burden. On the contrary, for selective IgA deficiency, immunoglobulin replacement is not required or recommended, as anaphylactic reactions may occur during IVIG infusions. Combined immunodeficiencies with antibody deficiency also benefit from immunoglobulin therapy until the defects in cell-mediated immunity are corrected by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, B-cell function is not restored universally after transplantation, and immunoglobulin therapy may be continued [86]. It is important that each patient receives a thorough evaluation before starting immunoglobulin therapy especially those with partial antibody defects.\n\n",

Immunoglobulin use in the setting of BMT is FDA approved. The rationale for using IVIG in transplantation is that the administration of passive antibodies may prevent infections in these immunocompromised patients and especially infections caused by CMV [84]. Several randomized controlled trials provided the basis to recommend IVIG after allogeneic BMT [19, 31, 46, 87, 98, 116, 117]. Meta-analysis of these trials found significant reduction of fatal CMV infections, CMV pneumonia, non-CMV interstitial pneumonia, and transplant-related mortality among patients receiving prophylactic IVIG [11]. While an improvement in survival was reported in some studies [46, 49, 118], a more recent meta-analysis showed that IVIG or hyperimmune CMV-IVIG had no effect on the reduction of all-cause mortality [90]. Collectively, the data regarding the benefit of prophylactic administration of IVIG after BMT remain controversial and contradictory. In addition, until currently, there is no consensus on the type, schedule, dose, and patients benefiting from IVIG. Subsequent studies suggested that double prophylaxis consisting of high-dose IVIG and ganciclovir was more successful than either treatment alone in reversing CMV pneumonia in patients after BMT [39, 69].",

IVIG was shown to decrease the severity of acute GVHD in recipients of allogeneic BMT [98, 116, 117]. On the contrary, administration of IVIG prophylaxis has no effect on the incidence or mortality of chronic GVHD on BMT [99]. While there is no consensus on the optimal dose of IVIG, it appears that the incidence of acute GVHD is less in patients receiving higher doses of IVIG. The benefits of IVIG appear to correlate with IgG trough levels where acute GVHD was less frequent among patients achieving maximum serum IgG levels \u22653000 mg/dl after the administration of IVIG. Trough serum IgG levels >1200 mg/dl were associated with less severe acute GVHD [1, 33, 40].",

Care of patients with sepsis has improved over the last decades; however, the incidence of sepsis is increasing along with morbidity and mortality rates especially in critically ill adults.

A number of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult critical care patients evaluating standard polyclonal IVIG- or IgM-enriched polyclonal adjunctive therapy in severe sepsis as well as the meta-analyses of these trials have been published [5, 65, 67, 75, 88, 105]. Positive findings of controlled trials and anecdotal reports have been criticized for methodological weakness including the small number of the patients and adequacy of blinding. The more recent studies, which were more meticulously designed, have shown much less effect of IVIG than older, smaller, and less well-designed studies [50]. Of note, the studies that used albumin as control showed less benefit of IVIG than those that did not [41]. The Score-Based Immunoglobulin G Treatment in Sepsis (SBITS) study, one carefully designed, large study representing almost half of all the adults studied to date, showed no reduction in mortality by IVIG in patients with score-defined sepsis and sepsis-induced multi-organ failure [113].",

While dose-ranging studies have not been completed, studies that used high (>1 g/kg body weight) doses of IVIG demonstrated better effects. This seems plausible given the clinical observations in other inflammatory conditions, such as Kawasaki disease, where greater effect was noted with higher doses [52]. The type of IVIG may have an important effect, possibly in favor of a greater pooled effect of IgMA-enriched compared with standard preparations of IVIG. IgMA-enriched preparations are associated with greater complement inactivation and improvement in microvascular perfusion in experimental models [112]. However, collectively, the results from animal models and in vitro experiments show contradictory results and do not allow for a definite conclusion regarding the superiority of one specific immunoglobulin preparation in patients with sepsis. In an efficacy study, administration of polyvalent IgG versus IgMA in selected patients at high risk for sepsis was associated with a comparable improvement in disease severity [89].",

If this window is missed, probabilities of success could be greatly diminished [6]. Pharmacokinetic studies of IVIG in sepsis have not been performed yet. Data for dosage selection in current practice are primarily derived from studies in volunteers and in patients with primary immune deficiencies and other indications for immunomodulation. Existing pharmacokinetic studies also do not address immunoglobulin clearance or area under the curve parameters and target serum immunoglobulin concentrations [64]. In addition, it is still unknown whether the main goal of IVIG in sepsis is to refill low levels of endogenous immunoglobulins or alternatively whether IVIG could exert a beneficial effect regardless of these levels [6].",

The long-anticipated sepsis trial (MONARCS [Monoclonal Anti-TNF, A Randomized Controlled Sepsis trial]) reported that afelimomab, which is made up of the Fab component of a monoclonal antibody against TNF-\u03b1, in patients with severe sepsis and elevated IL-6 levels decreased mortality and had a safety profile similar to placebo [85]. However, combining the results of these studies, a small improvement in mortality can be detected [34, 47]. As sepsis is increasingly being considered as an exaggerated, poorly regulated innate immune response to microbial products, by the time of diagnosis, an entire network of cytokines has already been activated. In this regard, the results of the previous studies would have been anticipated, as it seems unlikely that therapy aimed at only one cytokine would by itself have the highly significantly impact on sepsis mortality [34].",
