They are caused mostly by many kinds of RNA viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related virus, HIV-1, HCV, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and West Nile virus (Parashar et al. 2000; Lee and Henderson 2001). However, appropriate treatments have usually been delayed because most of the outbreaks have been so sudden that curative medicines could not be found against most RNA viruses in a timely fashion, as has been recently documented by SARS. Therefore, it is of particular importance to study the evolutionary mechanism for producing new variants of RNA viruses.",

First, we estimated the rates of synonymous substitution for 46 different species of RNA viruses except Puumala virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (HGV), using the time-serial sample data. Multiple alignment was made to match the coding regions by the computer program, CLUSTALW (Thompson, Higgins, and Gibson 1994). For each nucleotide sequence alignment, the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood method under the premise of the molecular clock (Rambaut 2000). Taking into account the difference in years of isolation among viral sequences, we estimated the divergence time of all nodes in the tree. We then inferred ancestral nucleotide sequences at all nodes of the phylogenetic tree from sequence comparisons by the maximum likelihood method (Yang, Kumar, and Nei 1995). These analyses were conducted using the PAML computer program. The number of synonymous substitutions was estimated for all branches by the Nei-Gojobori method (Nei and Gojobori 1986). The rate of synonymous substitution for each branch was, then, estimated by dividing the number of synonymous substitutions for that branch by the difference in years of the divergence or isolation between both ends of the branch. The error range of the synonymous substitution rates was also estimated, taking into account the standard error of the estimated divergence time at each node.",

These viruses were reported to coevolve with the host species (Horai 1995; Yanagihara et al. 1995; Asikainen et al. 2000; Robertson 2001). Therefore, the divergence time of a virus was considered to correspond to the divergence time of the host. We first constructed each multiple alignment of three RNA viruses to match the coding region by the computer program, CLUSTALW. From the multiple alignment, the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood method on the basis of the HKY model. The ancestral sequence of the divergence node was estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. The rate of synonymous substitution was estimated by dividing the average number of synonymous substitutions from the ancestral sequence to all tips of the phylogenetic tree by the time period from the known divergence time of the host to the present.",

In this method, both transitions and transversions were plotted against evolutionary distances such as the number of nucleotide substitutions. In figure 1, for example, we showed the comparison for transitions and transversions in human enterovirus A. When transitions occur much more frequently than transversions, no saturation of substitution is recognized. On the other hand, when transversions gradually outnumber transitions, substitution saturation is suspected because multiple substitutions may have occurred at each site. Therefore, we conducted the comparison of two regression slopes. If the slope of transitions is significantly steeper than that for transversions against evolutionary distances, the substitution was considered not to be saturated.",

The replication error rate of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was estimated from the passage number, the number of nucleotide substitutions during the passage, and the time required for viral budding (Dea 1995; Allende 2000). The results showed that the rate of replication error (the order is 10\u22125) was almost constant among the eight different species of RNA viruses in spite of the wide variation in the synonymous substitution rates among these species. These results indicated that the replication frequency should be the main source of the variation in the synonymous substitution rates because the constancy of the rates of replication error showed that these did not contribute strongly to the variation of the synonymous substitution rates among RNA viruses.",

These characteristics are considered to affect the replication frequency, because the viral life strategy is strongly related to the infectivity, and the strength of infectivity is related to an increase in the chance for replication. This indicates that the viral life strategy may be related to the replication frequency among RNA viruses. If the relationship between the viral life strategy and the replication frequency is certain, then the viral life strategy should be related to the rates of synonymous substitution among RNA viruses. This is because the main source of the rate variation for RNA viruses was considered to be the replication frequency, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, we compared viral life strategies of RNA virus with the rates of synonymous substitution (fig. 3).",

Infection modes are classified into acute, persistent, and latent infection. In general, the infection modes are not mutually exclusive. In fact, some viruses have both of acute and persistent infection phases. For example, measles viruses induce acute infection in the beginning, and maintain a persistent phase in the same host. When the replication of a virus is strictly limited, by some reasons, in the persistent phases, this infection mode is called latent infection. The viral transmissions were composed of six modes, i.e., aerosol transmission, contagious transmission, fecal-oral route transmission, transmission via blood (sexual relationship and artificial injection), transmission via a bite, and transmission via a vector.",

All of those differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05) by the two-tailed Wilcoxon test (fig. 3). Indeed, the replication frequencies for the viruses of only acute infection are considered to be higher than those for the viruses of only persistent infection, because viruses causing an acute symptom are expected to infect the neighboring host cells more frequently than viruses persistently holding a symptom (Overbaugh and Bangham 2001).",

On the other hand, the replication frequencies of latent infection are absolutely lower than those of only persistent infection because the replication of the virus are strictly limited in latent infection. Thus, we reasonably assume that the highest replication frequency is manifested by the viruses inducing both acute and persistent infection, the second highest by viruses inducing only acute infection, the third by viruses inducing only persistent infection, and the fourth by the viruses inducing latent infection. In fact, the rate of synonymous substitution for the viruses inducing both acute and persistent infection is the highest, that for the viruses inducing only acute infection is the second highest, that for the viruses inducing only persistent infection is the third, and that for the viruses inducing latent infection is the fourth. This is because differences in the infection modes are considered to affect the replication frequencies.",

As mentioned earlier, the transmission modes of RNA viruses were classified into six kinds, i.e., aerosol, contagious, fecal-oral, blood, bite, and vector. In figure 3, the synonymous substitution rates of viruses inducing aerosol, contagious, or fecal-oral route transmission were higher than those of the viruses inducing transmission via blood, bite, or vector, and the differences were significant (P < 0.05) by the two-tailed Wilcoxon test. These results implied that differences in viral transmission modes were also correlated with the rate of synonymous substitution. The correlation can be understood as follows. Viruses that spread rapidly among hosts through aerosol, contagious, or fecal-oral route transmission would quickly replicate because the viruses can infect many individuals surrounding an infected host. On the other hand, viruses that spread slowly among hosts by a transmission via blood, a bite or a vector would replicate slowly compared with viruses inducing a transmission via the aerosol, contagious, or fecal-oral routes. This indicated that the transmission mode affected the replication frequency and that differences in the replication frequencies contributed to the variation of the rate of synonymous substitution for RNA viruses. In fact, there was a good example in which a change of transmission mode seriously affected the evolutionary rate (Salemi et al. 1999). This report is consistent with our results that differences in the transmission mode affect differences in the replication frequency, and differences in the replication frequencies produced the rates of synonymous substitution.",
