In the stomach, organisms were located in foveolae and gland lumina and within unaltered and degenerate epithelial cells. In\u00afammatory in\u00aeltration was moderate and T cell dominated. In the intestine, bacilli were found in the gut lumen, between villi, in crypt lumina and within epithelial cells. Degeneration of crypt epithelial cells as well as crypt dilation and moderate to massive macrophage-dominated in\u00aeltration of the mucosa and submucosa were observed. Immunohistochemically, bacilli were positive with an antibody against Helicobacter. Ultrastructurally, the organisms strongly resembled Flexispira rappini', a spiral-shaped Helicobacter species known as a normal intestinal colonizer in dogs and mice.",

Intestinal Helicobacter infections in cats have been studied very little, presumably due to dif\u00aeculties in identifying these organisms. There are only two reports on intestinal Helicobacter infections with clinical symptoms in cats (Foley et al., 1998 (Foley et al., , 1999 . In dogs, mice and hamsters, however, these organisms are regarded as normal intestinal colonizers (Lockard and Boler, 1970; Gebhart et al., 1989; Schauer et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995) .",

Fungal elements or parasites were not demonstrated, and other bacteria were not observed in signi\u00aecant amounts.

Unfortunately, a microbiological examination was not performed which would have served to de\u00aenitely exclude other potential bacterial pathogens.

Intestinal Helicobacter infection, however, has only been reported twice in cats (Foley et al., 1998 (Foley et al., , 1999 . Helicobacter colifelis was isolated from the caecum and colon of a cat suffering from severe diarrhoea. The bacilli formed dense layers on the mucosal surface and within crypts which showed dilation and\u00afattened epithelium (Foley et al., 1998) . Helicobacter canis was isolated in a cat colony. The bacilli were found to be adhered to the colonic mucosal surface, and mixed cellular in\u00aeltrates and occasional crypt abscesses were observed. However, as both healthy cats and cats suffering from diarrhoea harboured the agent, the pathogenic role of H. canis could not be determined (Foley et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Helicobacter species like`F. rappini' and H. bilis are regarded as normal colonizers of the lower gastrointestinal tract in the mouse (Schauer et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995) . The same is true for H. cinaedi in hamsters (Gebhart et al., 1989) and H. canis in the dog (Stanley et al., 1993) . However, H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae have been shown to be potential enteric pathogens in humans (Totten et al., 1985) . There is evidence for H. canis to be an enteric pathogen in cats (Foley et al., 1999) , and a new Helicobacter species has been isolated from cotton-top tamarins with chronic colitis (Saunders et al., 1999) . Taking these observations and the present case into account, there is strong evidence that a group of phylogenetically closely related Helicobacter species are potentially enteropathogenic (Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995; Saunders et al., 1999) .",
