This term in Greek can refer to any kind of sickness; in Latin, the terms are plaga and pestis (Fig. 2.1 ).",

Some of those loosely defined plagues are likely occurrences of elements, but at least a few of them are clearly of infectious nature. Lice, diseased livestock, boils, and possible deaths of firstborn likely describe a variety of infectious diseases, zoonoses, and parasitoses [5] . Similar plagues were described and referred to in Islamic tradition in Chapter 7 of the Qur'an (Surat Al-A'raf, v. 133) [6] .",

In the Apocalypse or The Book of Revelation, Chapter 16, seven bowls of God's wrath will be poured on the Earth by angels, again some of the bowls containing plagues likely infectious in nature: \"So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast\" (Revelation 16:2). Those events, regardless of factual evidence, deeply shaped human history, and continue to be commemorated in religious practices throughout the world. As we will see, the beliefs associated with those fundamental accounts have been rooted in societal responses to pandemics in Western societies and continue to shape public sentiment and perception of current and future outbreaks. Examined through the lens of Abrahamic spiritual context, serious infectious outbreaks can often be interpreted as a \"Divine punishment for sins\" (of the entire society or its outcast segments) or, in its eschatological iteration, as events heralding the \"End of Days\" (i.e., the end of the world).",

The historic account of the Athenian plague is provided by Thucydides, who survived the plague himself and described it in his History of the Peloponnesian War [7] . The Athenian plague originated in Ethiopia, and from there, it spread throughout Egypt and Greece. Initial symptoms of the plague included headaches, conjunctivitis, a rash covering the body, and fever. The victims would then cough up blood, and suffer from extremely painful stomach cramping, followed by vomiting and attacks of \"ineffectual retching\" [7] . Infected individuals would generally die by the seventh or eighth day. Those who survived this stage might suffer from partial paralysis, amnesia, or blindness for the rest of their lives. Doctors and other caregivers frequently caught the disease, and died with those whom they had been attempting to heal. The despair caused by the plague within the city led the people to be indifferent to the laws of men and gods, and many cast themselves into self-indulgence [8] . Because of wartime overcrowding in the city of Athens, the plague spread quickly, killing tens of thousands, including Pericles, Athens' beloved leader. With the fall of civic duty and religion, superstition reigned, especially in the recollection of old oracles [7] .",

Following this stage, the victims would be \"seized by madness,\" causing great difficulties to those who attempted to care for them [17] . Many people died painfully when their buboes gangrened; others died vomiting blood. There were also cases, however, in which the buboes grew to great size, and then ruptured and suppurated. In such cases, the patient would usually recover, having to live with withered thighs and tongues, classic aftereffects of the plague. Doctors, noticing this trend and not knowing how else to fight the disease, sometimes lanced the buboes of those infected to discover that carbuncles had formed. Those individuals who did survive infection usually had to live with ''withered thighs and tongues'', the stigmata of survivors.

To that end, they started instituting mandatory isolation. The first known quarantine was enacted in Ragusa (City-state of Dubrovnik) in 1377, where all arrivals had to spend 30 days on a nearby island of Lokrum before entering the city. This period of 30 days (trentine) was later extended to 40 days (quarenta giorni or quarantine) [42] . The institution of quarantine was one of the rarely effective measures that took place during the Black Death and its use quickly spread throughout Europe.

In addition to Europe, where massive military movements and overcrowding contributed to massive spread, this virus devastated the USA, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The mortality rate of Spanish flu ranged between 10% and 20%. With over a quarter of the global population contracting that flu at some point, the death toll was immense -well over 50 million, possibly 100 million dead. It killed more individuals in a year than the Black Death had killed in a century [46] . This pandemic, unusually, tended to mortally affect mostly young and previously healthy individuals. This is likely due to its triggering a cytokine storm, which overwhelms and demolishes the immune system. By August of 1918, the virus had mutated to a much more virulent and deadlier form, returning to kill many of those who avoided it during the first wave [47] .",
