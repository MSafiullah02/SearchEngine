Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25-86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 \u00d7 10 9 /L vs 1.26 \u00d7 10 9 /L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.",

Huang et al. also found that 15% of patients with COVID-19 had hypertension, ranking second among all comorbidities (4).

However, at present, there were no researches about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and the effects of taking ACEI or ARB drugs on patients' prognosis.

Like AngII, ACE2 belongs to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and kallikreinbradykinin system family and is also a blood pressure regulating protein (10,11), which can degrade AngII to form Ang1-7 and degrade Des-Arg (9) bradykinin (DABK) to an active peptide (12) . As we all know, AngII and DABK can bind to corresponding receptors and play physiological roles such as constricting blood vessels, promoting value-added, inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and pulmonary fibrosis (12, 13) . While Ang1-7 can bind to specific Mas receptors and exert diastolic blood vessels, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-fibrotic, and anti-alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Therefore, ACE2 indirectly exerts anti-inflammatory and antilung injury effects. Animal experiments show that ACE2 expression in hypertensive rats is decreased (14, 15) . ACE2 is also the binding protein of novel coronaviruses (16) like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (17) . In studies on SARS, researchers found that coronavirus can cause ACE 2 levels to decline or even be absent (18, 19) , but the expression of ACE remains unchanged, and the balance of ACE2 and ACE in lung is broken (20) , leading to Ang\u2161 elevation and activation of the DABK-BK1 receptor pathway work The association between whether to take ACEI or ARB and prognosis in COVID-19 patients with hypertension was examined by logistic regression analysis performed by SPSS with adjustment for age, sex, hospitalization time, time from onset to hospital admission, and whether to take ACEI or ARB.",

Because novel coronavirus and SARS both use ACE2 as a receptor, we speculate that novel coronavirus and SARS have similar mechanisms of action ( Figure 1 ). Reduced lymphocyte count is one of the diagnostic criteria in the National Health Commission's diagnosis and treatment program. The results of this study show that COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had lower lymphocyte count. In reports by Peng et al., a persistent decline in lymphocyte counts was observed in death cases (3). Chen et al. also reported that patients with COVID-19 who were over 50 years of age, and low lymphocyte counts can easily turn into severe cases (21) . Maybe the lymphocyte count could reflect the severity of the condition in patients with COVID-19 to some extent, and this may explain the increased mortality in patients with a history of hypertension. Whether lymphopenia is due to the reduction of ACE2 caused by novel coronavirus invasion in COVID-19 patients with hypertension, the increase of AngII and Des-Arg bradykinin caused lung injury and inflammatory response, needs further basic experimental research.",

Statistical analysis under limited data showed that the prognosis of the two groups was not statistically different, but we need to note that there was a statistical difference in the age of the two groups. Further logistic regression analysis showed that patients whether had a history of taking ACEI or ARB were not correlated with prognosis. Studies show that both ACEI and ARB can cause increased expression of ACE2 (22, 23) . As the angiotensin type I receptor, ARB can increase Ang2, and then compensatingly increasing ACE2 expression. ACEI prevents Ang1 from forming Ang2, which in turn promotes ACE2 expression. But whether both types of drugs will affect COVID-19 patients with hypertension require further research.",
