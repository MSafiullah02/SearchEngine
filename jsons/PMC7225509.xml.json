It is also a period that is very affected by sustainable development issues that apply to all aspects of our society. Information technologies, because of their importance, do not escape preoccupations and questions as to their role and responsibility in developing a more respectful and sustainable economic model. As defined for the first time in 1987 in the Brundtland Report, \u00abhumanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [1]. This involves a gradual transformation of the economy and society across the spectrum of sustainability.",

In this context, information technologies have an ambivalent role: they reduce the impact on the environment in certain contexts of use, notably through virtualization or business process optimization. However, in other cases they are themselves responsible for negative effects on the environment, such as the very energy-intensive use of data centers [3]. This global dematerialization continues, particularly with the transition to the cloud, making IT responsible for 10% of global electricity consumption in 2017 [4]. Information technology must therefore be fully considered in sustainable development actions and more particularly in companies social and environmental responsibility (CSR) strategies. It is therefore essential to be able to provide models, methods and tools which allow, first, to measure and assess the impact of technologies on the environment, and then, second, to be able to apply tools in the development process of these technologies in order to improve their sustainability.",

In this new business model, the sustainability aspect is more rarely considered. Sustainable development efforts in the information technology sector have so far focused on infrastructure (data centers) and the manufacturing of hardware [6]. The data centers are particularly targeted by the objectives of reducing energy consumption in the IT sector, considering both their importance in the infrastructure of enterprises and their data, and their considerable energy requirements. In 2012, the European Union even took the lead by launching a project called GAMES (Green Active Management of Energy in IT Service centers), which aims to develop a set of tools, methods and techniques for managing the energy performance of next-generation data centers [7]. For both data centers and other information technology infrastructure and services, the source of energy consumption is in the software layer [8]. As a result, a reduction in the resource consumption of software components leads to a reduction in the electricity consumption of computer equipment. The software layer is therefore an important if not crucial lever in reducing ICT energy consumption.",

Sustainability is approached in a multidimensional way around 7 areas of action: communities and local development, human rights, relations and working conditions, consumer issues, the loyalty of practices and the environment. On the occasion of the Horizon 2020 program for research and innovation, the European Commission has also launched a platform providing information technology companies with a set of tools and methodologies to assess the energy consumption and the carbon footprint associated with technologies they use and develop1. This initiative aims to encourage companies to move towards eco-design by developing software solutions that use fewer resources and have a longer lifespan.

It is therefore important to add value to software that is developed in a sustainable way, and labeling is a way to give them more visibility. By engaging in the implementation of digital technology certifications and labels, governments, particularly at European and global levels, would help legitimise software eco-design in the eyes of users. Companies that make the effort to achieve a sustainable strategy in the development of their products also gain credibility compared to their competitors when this approach is formally recognized [16]. A sustainability label for digital software and services such as EcoSoft would therefore serve this objective of bringing more visibility and therefore credibility to ecodesign in the software field.
