            "text": "Longevity risk is the risk of more lives surviving than expected or observed death rates being lower than expected. In the past few decades or so, various medical advances and health technologies tend to reduce the number of deaths. As a consequence, life insurers are facing an increasing longevity risk and have experienced losses in their life annuity business. See, for example, China's average life expectancy increased from 71.5 years in 2000 to 74.83 years in the end of 2010. Insurers, pension funds, and others in the financial markets have always depended on actuarial data that extrapolates from the past, and thus, their reserves are not sufficient to cover their future liabilities. Recently, a proposal asking people to work longer and draw their pensions later in China has been raised to cope with the shortfall in pensions. In fact, the underfunding of too many definedbenefit pension systems by policy makers in the past has put employees' retirement security at risk in many countries. Therefore, how to manage longevity risk has become a hot topic for both academic researchers and practitioners. One of the most discussed methods of managing this risk is securitization, that is, isolating the cash flows linked to longevity risk and repackaging them into cash flows traded in capital markets. The longevity bond is one of the basic mortality-linked securities proposed in the academic literature for hedging longevity risk (see, e.g., [5, 6] ). The first modern issue of a longevity bond, with a maturity of 25 years, was announced in November 2004 by the European Investment Bank and BNP Paribas. Unfortunately, such a product was not successfully accepted by the investors. Although the longevity bonds have not been traded in real markets until now, life insurers, annuity writers, and pension fund companies all believe that the longevity bonds are effective instruments to manage longevity risk. So, there is a practical need to study how to price the longevity bonds.",

So far, a lot of stochastic mortality models have been proposed to forecast mortality rates over time, such as affine jump-diffusion processes (see, e.g., [4] ), CIR model, stochastic Gompertz-type model (see, e.g., [25] ), and so on. Recently, Milidonis et al. [26] proposed a Markov regimeswitching stochastic mortality model and provided empirical evidence for the switching behavior of the mortality rates by using the 1901-2005 U.S. population mortality index. Their empirical results revealed that the Markov regime-switching stochastic mortality models performed better than some important models, such as Lee-Carter [23] and Lin-Cox [24] models. They also considered the pricing of mortality securities under the Markov regime-switching stochastic mortality model and found that the regime-switching stochastic mortality model could correct some of the pricing biases, such as overestimation of the market price of mortality risk or underpricing mortality-linked securities.",

            "text": "In fact, Markov regime-switching models have been widely used in different branches of modern financial economics; see [8, 19, 27, 31] . In a regime-switching model, the market is assumed to be in different states depending on the state of the economy. Regime shift from one economic state to another may occur due to various financial factors like changes in business conditions, management decisions, and other macroeconomic conditions. Many researchers have empirically verified the advantages of using the Markov regime-switching model. In the bond market, the switching behavior of market interest rate has been well documented in the empirical finance literature. For example, Ang and Bekaert [1, 2] used interest rate data from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom to show empirically that the switching behavior of market interest rates was attributed to business cycles. In the stock market, by using monthly returns data from the Standard and Poor's 500 and the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 indices, Hardy [20] found that the regime-switching lognormal model fitted to the monthly returns data much better than other econometric models, such as the independent lognormal model and the ARCH-type models. In the insurance market, Hardy et al. [21] found that regimeswitching models outperformed other important models in modeling long-term equity returns for equity-linked guarantees. Indeed, life insurance products and pension funds are long-term instruments. Therefore, there is a practical need to incorporate the impact of macroeconomic and environmental conditions into modeling the dynamics of force of mortality. Intuitively, the force of mortality should be much lower when the macroeconomic and environmental conditions are both in good states.",

Note that the force of mortality modeled by them may take a negative value. However, we assume that the force of mortality is governed by the sum of a regime-switching, dynamic Gompertz-Makeham model and a regime-switching shot-noise model with only upward jumps.

            "text": "The regime-switching shot-noise process, which is a generalization of the shot-noise process (see, e.g., [11, 12, 15, 22] ), can be well used to measure the impact of shock events and the economic and environmental factors. The regime-switching shot-noise process measures the frequency, magnitude, and time period needed to go back to the previous level of force of mortality immediately after shock events occur. As time passes, the regime-switching shot-noise process decreases as people do their best to overcome these difficulties after the arrival of one of the shock events. This decrease continues until another event occurs, which will result in a positive jump associated with the economic and environmental state in the regime-switching shot-noise process. The motivation for adding a regime-switching shot-noise process to the force of mortality is twofold. First, when people suffer some severe contagious diseases, such as SARS coronavirus or natural disasters, the force of mortality may jump upward. As time passes, some treatments can reduce the risk of death. Second, the regime-switching shot-noise process allows us to obtain the Laplace transform of the regime-switching shotnoise process. Based on the Laplace transform, we can derive some formulas for the price of the longevity bond and survival probability. For modeling the short-rate dynamics, following Buffington and Elliott [8] , we assume that the interest rate is a deterministic function of economic and environmental conditions. Under the regime-switching pricing model, we provide two different approaches to price the longevity bonds. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the dynamics of the short interest rate and the force of mortality and derives the pricing formula for the longevity bond based on the conditional Laplace transform of the regime-switching shot-noise process. In Section 3, we provide an alternative approach to evaluate the longevity bond based on the concept of stochastic flows and the change-of-measure technique. Section 4 shows that the formulas obtained from the two different approaches are exactly equivalent. Section 5 gives some numerical results. Section 6 concludes. The proof of one main result is presented in the Appendix.",

If the numbers of states of the two chains are equal, then one can combine the two Markov chains to form one Markov chain, which describes the joint states of economic and environmental factors. Let X := {X t | t \u2208 T } be a homogenous continuous-time irreducible Markov chain with generator Q = (q ij ) i,j=1,2,...,N generating a filtration X = { X t | t \u2208 T }.

Since we focus on investigating the impact of the model parameters on the longevity bond price, we just make some numerical analysis without doing the calibration in this paper. In our future research agenda, we plan to use the population data to empirically test our model. For ease of illustration, we consider N = 2, that is, X only switches between two states, where state e 1 and state e 2 represent \"good\" and \"bad\" economic and environmental conditions, respectively. The parameters are fixed unless otherwise noted: h = (0.006, 0.007) * , l = (0.0000004, 0.00000045) * , c = (1.1, 1.15) * , x = 60, T = 10, S 0 = 0, q 12 = q 21 = 0.5, r = (0.05, 0.02) * , \u03b4 = 1, \u03c1 = (0.5, 1) * , f i (x) = \u03b1 i e \u2212\u03b1ix , x > 0, \u03b1 = (\u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 ) * = (5000, 2000) * . To investigate the regime-switching effect, we compare the regime switching intensities model with the one that has no regime switching. So, for each \u03b7 t = \u03b7, X t with \u03b7 = (\u03b7 1 , \u03b7 2 ) * , in the model without regime switching, we choose a constant \u03b7 such that Figures 1-3 present how the values of the model parameters impact the survival probability under the riskneutral measure. From them we can conclude that the survival probabilities are much larger when we start at X 0 = e 1 . We can also see that the survival probability in the no-regime-switching model is much larger than that in the regime-switching model. Figures 1-2 show that the survival probabilities increase in \u03b4 and \u03b1 because higher \u03b4 or \u03b1 decreases the value of the regime-switching shot-noise process. From Fig. 3 we can see Figure 1 . The relationship between 10p60 and \u03b4. Figure 2 . The relationship between 10p60 and \u03b1, \u03b11 = 2.5\u03b12. Figure 3 .

Figures 4-8 show that the impact of the values of the model parameters on the longevity bond price. From them we can see that the price is much larger when we start at X 0 = e 2 because the price not only depends on the force of mortality but also on the interest rate. Although the survival probabilities should be smaller when X 0 = e 2 , note that r 2 is also much smaller than r 1 . We can also see that the price in the no-regime-switching model is larger than that in the regime-switching model. From Figs. 4-5 we can see that the price is an increasing function of q 12 and a decreasing function of q 21 because higher q 12 leads to an increasing probability of switching to the state e 2 , whereas higher q 21 leads to an increasing probability of switching to the state e 1 . Figures 6-8 show the impact of the regime-switching shot-noise process on the longevity price. From them we can find that the price increases in \u03b4 and \u03b1 and decreases in the jump intensity \u03c1 because higher \u03b4 or \u03b1 decreases the value of the regime-switching shot-noise process, whereas a higher jump intensity increases the value of S.",

Under the assumptions that the interest rate is a deterministic function of Markov chain and the force of mortality is governed by the sum of a regime-switching dynamic Gompertz-Makeham model and a regime-switching shot-noise model, we use two different approaches to derive the semianalytical solution for the longevity bond price.",

However, the most efficient way to price derivatives in a stochastic interest rate environment is to use the change-ofnum\u00e9raire technique. Therefore, we also adopt the change\u00fe-of-measure technique to derive the pricing formula. In addition, motivated by Shen and Siu [30] , who explore the concept of stochastic flows to derive Markovian regime-switching exponential affine forms for the bond prices under a Markovian regime-switching jumpaugmented Vasicek model, we use the concept of stochastic flows to derive the Laplace transform of the regime-switching shot-noise process under the second approach. Although the formulas for the longevity bond price obtained from the two approaches have different forms of expression, we can prove that the two formulas are equivalent. Comparing the two approaches, the second approach, which is based on the change-of\u00femeasure technique, does not impose any restriction on the dynamics of the force of mortality. But we need to know the dynamics of the force of mortality under the new measures, and sometimes it is not easy to specify them. The first approach is valid only for some special cases that depend on the choice of the dynamics of the force of mortality. Under the model we propose in this paper, the first approach is much easier to implement.",
