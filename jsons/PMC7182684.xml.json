A milestone achievement is the International Health Regulations, a binding instrument of international law that entered into force on 15 June 2007 intending to assist countries to work together to save lives and livelihoods endangered by the international spread of diseases. The Regulations target the response to the international spread of disease as well as the core surveillance and response capacities of countries. Additionally, they give certain powers to State Parties (ie, closing ports, airports, and ground crossings) that governments cannot ordinarily exercise. Yet, these powers must be exercised with caution, in accordance with their relevant national law and obligations under international law, including human rights law, and upon considering scientific principles, available scientific evidence of a risk to human health, and WHO\u2019s guidance or advice [2]. As Habibi and colleagues point out, the intention of the Regulations is that \u201ccountries should not take needless measures that harm people or that disincentivise countries from reporting new risks to international public health authorities\u201d [3].",

To be effective, emergency handling and planning must be carried out in an environment in which new treatments \u2013 such as drugs and vaccines developed ad hoc to stop the outbreak \u2013 can be developed rapidly and delivered efficiently to all persons affected. This was not the case in the urban area of Wuhan, which suffered from health care delivery problems at the time of the outbreak. In a matter of days, the local authorities conclude that the health care facilities were insufficient to handle the emergency and announced plans to build from scratch not one but two new hospitals. These construction projects were completed in just a few days and accommodate 2300 patients. Similar problems are experienced by other nations as COVID-19 spreads.",

The failure to do so is a cautionary tale of insufficient efforts to protect global health. The global health community must thus push countries harder to keep strengthening their research capacity and basic health care infrastructure along with emergency handling and planning efforts. Human rights play a key told in pushing countries hard. They are a powerful tool to act as they create legal obligations that go beyond the immediate and pressing needs of emergency preparedness and handling. International human rights law is critical as it transforms global health best practices in legal duties.",

This provision imposes on State parties the duty to ensure that scientific knowledge is produced and translated into applications, such as drugs and vaccines, that are beneficial to rightsholders. For this, substantial public funds must be allocated on a regular basis to R&D. The Covenant also includes the duty to ensure a sufficient degree of scientific literacy in the population so that, when vaccines become available, patients readily embrace new treatments.",

In fact, the draft that was made public makes the case. It stresses that governments have \u201ca positive duty to actively promote the advancement of science\u201d and must fund basic and applied research (para. 50). To this, it adopts the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United Nations [7] that \u201call countries, including the poorest, to invest at least 1% of their GDP on research and urged the most advanced countries to spend at least 3% of their GDP on research and development\u201d (para. 51). Furthermore, it states that governments must approve \u201cpolicies and regulations which foster scientific research, allocating appropriate resources in the budgets and, in general, creating an enabling and participatory environment for the conservation, development and diffusion of science and technology\u201d (para. 50).",

The global health community should not forget that ensuring good science and the attainment of the highest level of health are human rights and an indispensable dimension of global health policy. Only when cultivated and guaranteed as a human right, science provides the support needed to fight global health emergencies.",
