To inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the main protease (Mpro) that performs key biological functions in the virus has been the focus of extensive studies. With the fastresponse experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently. Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes. By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called \"anchor\" site. Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.",

            "text": "C oronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. COVID-19 first emerged in the city of Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019 but now has turned into a global pandemic reported in all continents just after a few short months. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly contagious and spreads mainly from human to human through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing of the infected persons as well as by fomites. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of viruses named coronaviruses for the crownlike spikes on their surface that can infect bats, birds, pigs, cows, and other mammals and mutate easily to transfer from animals to humans. 1 Before the COVID-19 outbreak, six strains of such virus already have been identified as human pathogens known to cause viral respiratory illness. However, not all of them are highly pathogenic. For examples, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 merely cause a common cold. In contrast, both the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 3 have caused large-scale outbreaks during the past two decades with significant case-fatality rates (9.6% for SARS and 34% for MERS). As for COVID-19, its case-fatality rate remains uncertain given the pandemic is still in its early stages.",

For example, maturation of 12 nonstructural proteins (Nsp4\u2212Nsp16), including critical proteins like the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, Nsp12) and helicase (Nsp13), requires the cleavage through the Mpro. It has been demonstrated in experiment that the Mpro inhibition prevented viral replication in multiple studies. 4, 5 Considered as the Achilles' heels of SARS-CoV-2, the Mpro is therefore among the top candidates for drug discovery. Additionally, the Mpro's inhibitor(s) is likely to inactivate virus in different cell types in different organs, independent of the various receptors/host proteases (on the cell membrane) required for virus entry.",

Irreversible inhibitors like N3 are efficacious and have been proven to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus in in vitro viral proliferation models with moderate efficacy (EC 50 = 4\u22125 \u03bcM). 5 However, development of these tool drugs into an approved drug could take years to accomplish. In an BioRxiv preprint, 6 a few marketed drug such as ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, and carmofur have exhibited EC 50 values of 0.67 \u03bcM, 9.35 \u03bcM, 1.55 \u03bcM, and 1.82 \u03bcM respectively with an in vitro enzymatic assay, which translate to an EC 50 of 4.6 \u03bcM in antiviral activity for ebselen (best in class), compared to an EC 50 of 16.77 \u03bcM for N3. 5 These experiments validated that Mpro could be a viable antiviral target, albeit additional efforts are needed to search for more potent and specific antiviral drugs with a better safety margin than ebselen that is an (irreversible) inhibitor for the Mpro and many other enzymes in a broad spectrum of tissues with significant cellular toxicity. 7 Motivated by the fact that Mpro can be inhibited by multiple drug-like ligands, we speculated that a range of drug molecules may efficaciously interact with the Mpro pocket. Given the urgency, we used in silico methods to explore a set of 19 marketed drugs that have exhibited a great deal of promise in clinics, aiming to identify the potential high-potential ones for the Mpro inhibition and discover a common binding mechanism for these drug molecules inside the Mpro's pocket.",

We first equilibrated the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 6LU7] in the physiologically relevant environment. The simulation system is illustrated in Figure 1 . The dimer structure of the Mpro (colored blue and purple) is illustrated in the cartoon representation. The entire protein was then solvated in a water box with dimensions of 97.4 \u00c5 \u00d7 97.4 \u00c5 \u00d7 97.4 \u00c5. Eighty-eight K + and 80 Cl \u2212 ions were added to the solution to neutralize the net charge of the protein and set the ion concentration to 0.15 M. The MD simulations were carried out on the IBM Power-cluster. We applied the TIP3P model 11, 12 for water, the standard ion force field, 13 and the CHARMM36 force field 14 for the protein. A smooth cutoff (10\u221212 \u00c5) was used to calculate van der Waals energies. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particlemesh Ewald (PME) method (grid size of \u223c1 \u00c5). With the SETTLE algorithm 15 enabled to keep all bonds rigid, the simulation time step was 2 fs The entire simulated system was first equilibrated at 1 bar and 300 K, with all backbone atoms in the Mpro harmonically restrained (spring constant k = 1 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 ) for \u223c5 ns, during which the Mpro pocket was properly solvated by water molecules. In the subsequent production simulation, the restraint was removed and the Mpro was further equilibrated in the NPT ensemble. The Langevin dynamics was applied to maintain the constant temperature (300 K) in the simulated system, and the pressure was kept constant at 1 bar using the Nose\u2212Hoover Langevin method. 16 During the 125 ns production run, the overall dimer structure was stable and the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of the protein's backbone calculated against the crystal (initial) one (PDB entry 6LU7) saturated at 1.7 \u00c5 after \u223c10 ns. Note that in the crystal structure there exists the N3 ligand (inside the Mpro's pocket) that is covalently linked to the Mpro, i.e., the irreversible binding. It is conceivable that the Mpro' pocket may slightly change its conformation once the N3 molecule is removed. When we were close to completing the writing of this paper, the apo structure (PDB entry 6Y2E) of the Mpro became available in the PDB. The RMSD calculated against this latest Mpro's crystal structure without any bound ligand shows a smaller mean value, indicating that without a bound ligand the equilibrated protein structure is closer to the apo structure.",

In this study, for the docking part, we employed AutoDock Vina, which is a successor of the most cited 23 We carried out the docking calculations on an IBM power node with 24 physical cores and 192 CPUs. We obtained ready-to-be-docked mol2 files for most drug molecules from the ZINC database, except for N3 and O6K whose PDB files were obtained from the RCSB PDB. For preparation of the ligands and target protein to be applied in AutoDock Vina for rigid docking, we used the scripts prepare_ligand4.py and prepare_receptor4.py provided with the AutoDock Tools 21, 22 suite to generate the corresponding input files in PDBQT format, which extends the PDB format with additional fields of partial charge and atom type. To increase the chance of finding the minimum binding energy to predict where and how a putative ligand can best bind the target protein, we set the exhaustiveness parameter of the program to 100 (the number of individual samplings/searches to find the proper pose). Figure 3a shows the Mpro protein (equilibrated) with a ligand-binding pocket, surrounded by a rectangular box within which a ligand is docked. We first used the available crystal structure (PDB entry 6Y2F) with a bound O6K molecule (shown in Figure 3b ) as a reference to calibrate the docking procedures. After searching hundreds of poses, the program yielded the best pose (shown in Figure 3c ) that was very similar to that in the crystal structure (shown in Figure 3d ). The obtained docking (affinity) score using the highly optimized score-function in Autodock Vina is \u22127.4 kcal/mol. The main difference is present in the O6K's Boc group [containing the -C-(CH 3 ) 3 group]. In the equilibrated structure (Figure 3c ), the tail resides inside the pocket region between the \u03b2-sheets (residues from Tyr161 to Asp176) and the coil (residues from Gly183 to Ala194). Hereafter, we refer to this special pocket region (also labeled with a star in Figure  2c ) as the \"anchor\" site. However, in the crystal structure, the same Boc group is present above the \u03b2-sheet, which likely resulted from the competitive occupancy of the \"anchor\" site by a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecule (Figure 3d ). In Figure S1 , we show from MD simulations that the Boc group of O6K occupies the \"anchor\" site after the removal of the DMSO molecule.",

Its affinity score is as good as that for N3. Figure 4s shows the top pose of a curcumin molecule nicely fit inside the Mpro pocket. It is well-known that curcumin had a low bioavailability (1%) that The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter could hamper the utility of its treating systemetic viral infection; therefore, it is important to find a viable formula that can deliver sufficient curcumin to the target organ. 27 However, there is some evidence that orally administered curcumin accumulates in sufficient quantity in the GI tract and liver. Besides the lung, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also infects the GI tract, causing the patients also to experience diarrhea. 28, 29 The GI tract and liver are immune privileged and may provide a shelter for the SARS-CoV-2 virus from attacks by the immune system. 30,31 Virus from the GI tract would be shedding off even after the lung tissue is free of viral infection, which could pose a great threat to infect others in shared bathrooms or via the aerosol formed in a sewage system. Additionally, the GI system also expresses a high level of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2, which is critical for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent the GI system from providing a protective shelter for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is beneficial to take drugs (such as curcumin) to curb the virus infection of the GI system during the drug treatment regime, and even after the viral infection is tampered in the lung.",

The force field parameters for entecavir were obtained from SwissParam. 45 We applied the same MD simulation protocol used for the apo Mpro equilibration (Figures 1 and 2) . To highlight the positions of the entecavir molecule inside the Mpro pocket, we overlapped the center of mass (COM) of entecavir during the entire MD simulation in Figure 5b . Notably, there are two clusters of COMs, representing the start and final locations of the entecavir molecule. The entire process for entecavir's repositioning its pose inside the Mpro pocket is illustrated in the movie in the Supporting Information. Figure 5c shows the initial pose of the entecavir molecule in the MD simulation, which is also the best pose from the docking study. Inside the Mpro pocket, the entecavir molecule formed hydrogen bonds with residues Thr26, His41, and Gly143. Overall, entecavir is smaller than the Mpro's pocket, and the \"anchor\" site (the orange oval in Figure 5c ) mentioned above is not occupied. After entecavir has drifted to the new location inside the Mpro, it coordinates with His41, Gln189, and Glu166 through hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the fivemembered ring in the entecavir molecule entered the \"anchor\" site (see the orange oval in Figure 5d) , driven by the hydrophobic interaction. Note that the new pose of entecavir found in the MD simulation is similar to the eighth pose with a slightly higher score (\u22125.9 kcal/mol) discovered in the docking study. This highlights that when including the solvent effect the affinity scores listed in Figure 4t can be different (\u223c10%), which can somewhat affect the rank order.",

On the basis of the concept of the solvent-accessible surface area, we calculated the surface areas of the Mpro pocket (S M ), the entecavir molecule (S E ), and their complex (S T ). Thus, we Figure 5e shows the calculated contact area during the >300 ns MD simulation. In the first \u223c75 ns, the entecavir molecule stayed in its initial location with an average contact area of \u223c2.4 nm 2 . After that, it drifted away from its initial location and move into water above the Mpro pocket. The contact area decreased to approximately zero. Without drifting further into water, the entecavir molecule reentered the Mpro pocket, and the contact area increased to \u223c2.6 nm 2 . During the rest of the MD simulation (\u223c250 ns), the entecavir moleule remained stable in the new location. In an independent MD simulation, the entecavir molecule left its initial location within tens of nanoseconds and drifted into the water environment, which reassures that the entecavir's initial pose is less stable than the final pose revealed in the MD. Among all of the drug ligands studied here, nelfinavir appears to be highly promising as the Mpro's inhibitor, suggested by our docking study (Figure 4) . Thus, we carried out two independent MD simulations (Sim-1 and Sim-2) for nelfinavir in Mpro's pocket (Figure 6a ) to corroborate our prediction. From the two independent MD simulations, we found that the nelfinavir molecule was stably bound inside the Mpro's pocket, as shown by the overlapped COMs of nelfinavir (Figure 6b for Sim-1 and Figure S2 for Sim-2). The stability was contributed by the internal hydrogen bond between the -NH and -C=O groups (Figure 6c) , two hydrogen bonds between nelfinavir and residues His163 and Gln189 in Mpro (Figure 6c) , and the significant amount of hydrophobic interactions between nelfinavir and Mpro. Overall, the entire molecule was nicely fit inside the Mpro's pocket, with its benzene group located at the \"anchor\" site ( Figure 6d) . We further highlight the stable binding of nelfinavir with snapshots at simulation times of 0, 66, 144, and 177 ns (Figure 6e ,f) and with a movie in the Supporting Information showing the simulation trajectory (Sim-1). Therefore, the predicted pose of nelfinavir in the Mpro's pocket, from docking, was confirmed by MD simulatons. Compared with entecavir, nelfinavir almost occupies the whole Mpro's pocket and has a much larger contact area (\u223c4.5 nm 2 ) with the Mpro, as shown in the two independent MD simulations (Sim-1 and Sim-2) in Figure 6i .",

Besides the binding energy, we have also considered comprehensively the bioavailabilities and half-lives of the drugs, which translate into effective drug concentrations around the targets. We found that the docking affinity scores of several molecules (such as nelfinavir and entecavir) are very close to those of the ligands found experimentally (N3 and O6K), and their binding stabilities with the Mpro were verified in MD simulations. Indeed, during the review of this work, a preprint published in bioRxiv shows that experimentally nelfinavir can strongly inhibit the Mpro in vitro. 46 However, we note that there are potential limitations of our methods, such as the approximated scoring functions in the docking method and classic force fields in the MD method. Therefore, the rank order provided in Figure 4t is by no means intended to promote certain drug molecules. Instead, by examining almost 100 different poses of each docked molecule, we realized the importance of the \"anchor\" site in the Mpro pocket. Besides the hint from docking studies, we confirmed in MD simulation that by occupying the \"anchor\" site, a ligand can reside inside the Mpro pocket more stably via hydrophobic interactions. More importantly, the binding mechanism revealed in this work is supported by evidence observed in experimental studies, including the recently published one (during the review of this work) showing the bindings of compounds 11a and 11b with a hydrophobic group in the \"anchor\" site. 47 Therefore, we conclude that a drug molecule can be more potent with a hydrophobic bulky group occupying the \"anchor\" site. Given the bottleneck in the current testing capacity and throughput of the Mpro protease assay,we expect that these in silico results and predictions could help the wet-lab groups to prioritize their testing and shed light on the future discovery of highly potent inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2's Mpro.",
