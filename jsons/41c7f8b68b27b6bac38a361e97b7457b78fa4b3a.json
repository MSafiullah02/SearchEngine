Although the coronavirus, implicated in SARS, may have directly caused the aforementioned; glucocorticoids can cause lymphopenia by causing the migration of lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation [3] [4] [5] , and neutrophilia [3, 6] by inhibiting apoptosis [6] . Moreover, glucocorticoids are used in lymphoproliferative diseases as cytolethal agents [7] . Glucocorticoids were used in treating SARS patients, and thus lymphopenia and neutrophilia may have been drug induced. In one study [2] , the prevalence of lymphopenia was 54% at admission, but only 40% of the patients were treated with steroids for the first 48 h.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was subsequently confirmed in all patients by seropositivity and /or positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain test for SARSassociated coronavirus. Serum specimens from 57 patients, all collected in the morning and before the commencement of therapy, were assayed for cortisol by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, IN). The intra-and interassay coefficients of variation were 2\u00b70 and 3\u00b70%, respectively. In two patients cortisol exceeded 7220 nmol L \u22121 (peak stress response [8] ) and were eliminated before statistical analyses. An aliquot of blood specimen was used for WBC measurements. T lymphocytes (CD3 + ), B lymphocytes (CD19 + ), helper T lymphocytes (CD3 + CD4 + ), suppressor T lymphocytes (CD3 + CD8 + ), and natural killer lymphocytes (CD3 -CD16 + and /or CD56 + ) in whole blood were measured by MutliTEST\u2122 IMK Kit along with TruCOUNT Tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA) using a 4-colour FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The method had 10% imprecision. Lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte count < 19% [normal range ( NR) 19-47%] and neutrophilia as neutrophil count > 73% ( NR 41-73%) of the total WBC.
