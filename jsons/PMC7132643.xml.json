The contact time for all products was modified to 30 seconds. For each sample tested, 2 mL of test substance was applied directly to the virus film. Aerosolized products were used according to manufacturer's directions. At the 30-second contact time, 0.2 mL of the virus/test substance mixture was neutralized into 1.8 mL of media with 2% serum and serial 10-fold dilutions were performed. A total of 0.2 mL of each dilution was then inoculated into each of 4 wells containing the host cells.

The viral cytopathogenic effect was characterized by a degenerated cell sheet and cell detachment. To monitor the general health of the cells in each experiment, control wells containing cells grown in the absence of virus and product were observed throughout the course of the assay period.

Although some of the agents showed a lower log reduction, this was due to cellular toxicity effects of the agents themselves and not necessarily due to differences in antiviral activity. The household products containing tricolsan or the combination of ethanol and a quaternary compound demonstrated more toxicity to the cell line than the other products and therefore were placed through sephadex columns to reduce toxicity. It was interesting that the triclosan products being tested with sephadex columns resulted in the highest titers.",

It should be noted that this calculation method can only be performed on viruses that cause cytopathogenic effect in cultured cells and an adequate amount of incubation time allowed for infection to take place. In these experiments, the health of the cells was monitored closely in the presence and absence of virus or active alone as well as during the incubation of both.
