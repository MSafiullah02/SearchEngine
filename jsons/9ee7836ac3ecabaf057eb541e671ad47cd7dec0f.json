            "text": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It surged in the Lombardi region of Italy in February 2020 and, later, New York, USA, became the epicenter in March-April 2020. Severe COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting the elderly and people with underlying medical problems. In a review by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, out of the 1,321 children tested positive for COVID-19, 31 (18.1 %) were less than one year of age [1] . Disease characterization of early cases among children in the United States revealed 398 (15%) cases under one year of age [2] . Separate data on cases in neonates is not available in these studies. Reports of neonatal cases are sparse, posing many unanswered questions on the disease characteristics of COVID-19 in this population. 1, 2  3  1  1  1 We report a three-week-old neonate with a COVID-19 infection in New York, USA. This 22-dayold male neonate presented to the emergency department on March 20, 2020, with a one-day history of fever and decreased oral intake. There was no history of cough or rhinorrhea. The parents were asymptomatic; however, the grandparents who visited the baby a week prior to his illness subsequently developed fever and cough two days after their visit. The infant was born via vaginal delivery at 39 weeks gestation, without complications. The mother had an uneventful antenatal course. The baby was discharged home with his mother two days after birth. He was exclusively breastfed and was healthy until this illness.",

Initial laboratory evaluation included a white blood cell count of 4,000 cells /mm 3 (normal range 7800-15,900 cells/mm 3 ) with 17% neutrophils, 51% lymphocytes, 24% monocytes, and 1% immature neutrophils.

In light of the community transmission of COVID-19, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The infant was kept in a negative pressure room with enhanced infection control precautions requiring an N95 mask, eye shield, gloves, and gowns. He was started on antibiotics after obtaining blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid for bacterial cultures.",

Six of them presented within three days of life whereas the others presented between five and 28 days of life. Seven out of the 11 neonates had fever as the presenting complaint. Eight of the neonates were born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of eight infants, along with the infant described in the current report, are summarized in Table 2 . Complete details on the other three cases were not available and hence not included in the table. Three separate neonates with COVID-19 presenting within the first two days of life were also reported in media, complete details of which were not available. Serological evidence of COVID-19 with elevated immunoglobulin-M levels was shown in three neonates but with negative PCR testing [12] [13] . There is a lack of definitive evidence pointing towards in utero SARS-CoV-2 transmission at this time [14] . Patek et al. (10) Coronado et al. [15] . The common clinical manifestations of fever, cough, or shortness of breath were observed only in 73% of the cases, indicating that children may not always present with the classic symptoms, unlike adults. The severity of illness and the rates of hospitalization were disproportionately higher among infants in the above studies. Fever appears to be the main presenting symptom of COVID-19 in a majority of the neonates described in the literature so far (8 of 12, 66%) and the prognosis seems to be good [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In summary, even though infants appear to be at a higher risk of severe illness, neonates tend to have a milder infection based on the very limited number of cases published so far.",

            "text": "There are several hypotheses explaining the reason for neonates being at lower risk for severe COVID-19. One hypothesis is related to the maturation and functioning of receptors. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 has been proven to be the principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In neonates, it is possible that the receptor activity is immature or there is an increase in angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 activity [18] . Another postulation is a higher CD4 to CD8 ratio in neonates. It has been observed that older males with COVID-19 infection had a low CD4 count. Infants, on the other hand, have a high CD4 to CD8 ratio [19] . This change in lymphocyte proportion is related to the changes and involution of thymus in infants. The protective role of maternal antibodies acquired transplacentally is also to be studied. There are also reports of thrombotic complications contributing to the mortality and morbidity in adult COVID-19 patients [20] . If this is true, the possible role of fetal hemoglobin in the milder presentation of COVID-19 in neonates needs to be further explored.",

Remdesivir, an adenosine analog that incorporates into RNA and causes premature termination, is a promising antiviral agent, with preliminary reports suggesting clinical benefit in adult patients. It is available through compassionate use, as well as emergency authorization use, for neonates. Another promising option is convalescent plasma obtained from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection with detectable antibodies. It is available as part of clinical trials in many centers. At the beginning of the outbreak, hydroxychloroquine was used as a first-line agent, however, there is insufficient data to suggest any benefit. In addition, COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with a severe inflammatory response, including high pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). An IL-6 monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab, is being used as part of clinical trials with benefit.",

Fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of neonatal COVID-19 and its testing should be considered in the evaluation of a febrile infant presenting to the emergency department. Infected infants can shed the virus through the respiratory tract as well as in stool. Thereby, caregivers should take caution with good hand hygiene, particularly when changing diapers. Thus, prompt recognition of illness in this population is essential to limit further transmission in the community. Finally, it is important to understand that these conclusions are based on limited data and our understanding will continue to evolve.",
