On the same day, he also developed mild nasal-congestion and rhinorrhea, both lasting 2 days. On January 23, his body temperature was normal in the morning but rose again to 37.5\u00b0C at noon, which was again temporarily controlled by the drugs; however, in the evening he had fever again. On the same day before the onset of fever, Patient-2 went to visit Patient-Index, and brought him some home-made food. They ate and chatted together in his room which was tightly confined with no doors or windows open and without air-conditioning for about 0.5 h. Patient-2 later became infected. Having learned about the COVID-19 emergence in Wuhan and the possible human-to-human-transmission from Internet at noon on January 22, he decided to go to Hospital-1 for further assessment and management in the evening on January 23. Virus-RNA detection using respiratory-samples taken on January 26 and 27 both revealed positive results on rRT-PCR assays, confirming the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1). Assays to detect other pathogens were all negative. Further descriptions of the disease-course and management of Patient-Index are detailed in Supplementary results.",

These changes were not consistent with the previous report on older patients with more severe conditions.10 These may suggest diverse immune-status against the virus. Neutrophilia may be related to cytokine-storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts, SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had fewer lymphocytes and higher fibrinogen and C-reactive-protein levels.

While the most likely one was via droplets or aerosol or airborne, we did not collect urine or fecal samples, which prevented us from analyzing whether COVID-19 could be transmitted through the fecal-oral pathway. Third, the relative-risk of infection among youngsters compared to older individuals and the association of timing or mode of manifestations and CT and laboratory findings with disease-course, outcomes, and spread need to be further evaluated.
