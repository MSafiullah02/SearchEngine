            "text": "Additionally, we observed a number of both early or late adverse events. Among the early potentially drug-related side effects the most frequently seen were hypertransaminasemia (15/51), thrombocytopenia (7/51) and neutropenia (3/51), although the role of SARS-CoV-2 per se or of concomitant medications cannot be excluded. The late events were serious bacterial and fungal infections of the bloodstream. The latter occurred in 12/14 patients while in ICU. In particular, the three episodes of candidemia are concerning because of their life threatening nature and may indicate a severe underlying immunosuppression. Indeed, the use of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is known to be associated with an increased risk of serious bacterial and fungal infections [30, 31] as a result of the blockade of IL-6 that may impair B-cell proliferation and T-cell differentiation and cytotoxicity, essential for immune control of infections [32]. This is particularly true for patients hospitalized in ICU, who are known to be at higher risk of bloodstream infections [33]. Indeed, we found mechanical ventilation at the time of tocilizumab therapy to be independently associated with the risk of death at multivariable analysis. A possible explanation of the different incidence of side effects, in particular infective events, between our study and previous reports might be the longer follow up of our observation, given the half-life of tocilizumab and the persistence of active drug levels for weeks after the infusion [34].",

In addition, all our patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or remdesivir, alone or in combination. The variety of treatment schedules used accounted for the absence of defined treatment protocols that reflects the first few weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic and represents an evident confounding factor in the analysis of potential therapeutic efficacy. However, in our cohort the high mortality rate was observed over a longer follow-up period than in other published, uncontrolled experiences with tocilizumab. In addition, this elevated mortality rate did not differ from what is reported in other cohorts of severely ill patients in whom different treatments other than tocilizumab were used [11]. Only randomized, controlled trials will clarify the efficacy of tocilizumab in the different severity categories of patients and the best timing of its administration and will identify the subgroup of patients for whom immunosuppression could be harmful.",
