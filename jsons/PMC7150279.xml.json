In contrast to pharmacological interventions in these systems, which often lack specificity, the targeted genetic alteration of the expression of single-hormone system components is the most straightforward method to analyze their functions in cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis and disorders. Accordingly, the generation of transgenic and knockout (KO) animals was widely used to study the role of RAS components in cardiovascular control and in the pathogenesis of diseases.1\n,\n2 The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the RAS, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Ang-(1-7), and Mas.",

The first successful genetic modifications of a mouse were achieved by Gordon and colleagues.4 This group demonstrated that foreign genes can be integrated into the mouse genome by transfer of DNA constructs into the pronuclei of zygotes. By the use of specific promoters, the investigator can direct the expression of the transgene into specific tissues. About 10 years later, the same technology was also established for the rat, interestingly first targeting the RAS component renin.5\n",

            "text": "Since 1986, the elimination of gene expression is also possible by homologous recombination-mediated targeted gene KO in embryonic stem (ES) cells.6, 7, 8 To this purpose, firstly, a targeting vector has to be designed and constructed that contains parts of DNA sequences homologous to the gene of interest and the intended mutation. Following the transfection of this vector into ES cells, a few cells will incorporate it into the endogenous gene via homologous recombination and can be selected by appropriate methods. These successfully targeted ES cells are injected into host blastocysts, and a chimeric animal is obtained. This animal carries the mutation in part of its cells and will eventually pass it on to its offspring, which will be heterozygous or homozygous (KO) for the mutant gene. The KO animals will present the physiological phenotype caused by the absence of the gene product.6 In general, this method is still the most commonly used for the targeted alteration of the mouse genome. It took more than 20 years for this technology to also became available for the rat by the discovery of a method to establish germ-line-competent ES cells from this species in 2008,9 and a few KO rat models have been developed since using ES cells.10\n,\n11 However, recently, novel methods for the targeted alteration of genes in the mouse and rat genome have become available, which will probably replace the relatively complicated ES cell method in the near future. They are based on nucleases that are targeted to a certain site in the genome by different methods.12 Zinc finger (ZFN) and TALE nucleases use protein domains that specifically recognize a DNA sequence of choice, while the CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a guide RNA that binds DNA by specific base pairing. Since only one animal model for the RAS has been described yet produced by ZFN technology, the renin-KO rat,13 and since the Mas-KO rat has obviously been generated using ZFNs (http://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=5131952; access 25.04.2014) but is not yet published, we will not go into more detail on these novel technologies.",

Mas deletion decreased the responsiveness of adipocytes to insulin accompanied by a decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 in adipose tissue.75 Moreover, Silva et al. recently showed that Mas deletion in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis.76\n",

Surprisingly, this chronic increase in Ang-(1-7) did not alter basal blood pressure levels measured by telemetry. However, TGR(A1-7)3292 rats displayed a marked reduction in isoproterenol-induced heart hypertrophy and an improvement of postischemic systolic function.54 Botelho-Santos and colleagues57 showed changes in systemic and regional hemodynamic parameters in these rats, resulting in an increase of vascular conductance in several tissues and a decreased total peripheral resistance. Furthermore, the transgenic rats showed a significant increase in stroke volume and cardiac index57 and a reduction in basal urinary flow, leading to increased urinary osmolality and osmolal clearance.80 Furthermore, chronic elevation of circulating Ang-(1-7) levels considerably improved the lipid and glycolytic profile and lowered the fat mass accompanied by a decrease in triglycerides and cholesterol in plasma and an improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and reduced gluconeogenesis in the liver.55\n,\n56\n",

Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. KO models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic-syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues. Inducible and cell-type-specific KO models for Mas and ACE2 will be helpful in the future to deepen our understanding of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis.",
