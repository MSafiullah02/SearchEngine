However, within their biological milieu, viruses do replicate and evolve, and they are composed of the same types of organic macromolecules as are cellular lifeforms. Because of their intimate relationship with cellular life-forms, it seems legitimate to integrate the schemes for classifi cation of viruses with the schemes used for biological classifi cation of cellular life-forms (Lefkowitz 2012 ) . Initially, various features, like host range, crossimmunity, clinical disease, and pathologic features, were used to classify viruses. Technological advances have led to more detailed and integrated classifi cation, taxonomy, and phylogenetic characterization (evolutionary relatedness) of viruses. Sophisticated nucleic acid sequence analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for virus classifi cation and phylogenetic determination, in spite of some limitations (Holmes 2008 ; McCormack and Clewley 2002 ; Zanotto et al. 1996 ) .",

Classifi cation is based on the genomic nucleic acid used by the virus (DNA or RNA), strandedness (single or double stranded), and method of replication. The system has been used to defi ne seven classes of viruses: Class I: Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) Class II : Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) The primary classifi cation of viruses is into species. A virus species is defi ned as a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a specifi c ecological niche (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2002 ). In polythetic classifi cations, group members share a number of characteristics, but no single characteristic is necessary or suffi cient to defi ne members of the group. Higher-level taxa are monothetic, i.e., there are characteristics that are necessary and suffi cient to defi ne members of the class. It is important to note that not all viruses can be assigned through all taxonomic levels. Virus species may be assigned to a genus or remain unassigned. Similarly, a genus may be assigned to a family or subfamily, or remain unassigned, and so on up the taxonomic hierarchy. Each genus has a type species . The type species is the virus that necessitated the creation of the genus; it is always linked to the genus.",

Icosahedral capsids are very common; these quasi-spherical shells are composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles with 30 edges and 12 vertices.

The sequence of genes of positive-sense ssRNA may be directly translated by the host into viral proteins. The sequence of negative-sense ssRNA is complementary to the coding sequence for translation, so mRNA must be synthesized by RNA polymerase, typically carried within the virion, before translation into viral proteins. The sequence of positive-sense ssDNA is the same as that of the mRNA coding for viral proteins; negative-sense ssDNA is complementary to mRNA and may be transcribed into mRNA for viral protein synthesis. Ambisense single-stranded nucleic acids use both positive-sense and negative-sense sequences. The viral nucleic acid may be linear or circular; the nucleic acid may be in the form of a single molecule or broken into two or more segments.

The utility is greatest for related groups of viruses (Lauber and Gorbalenya 2012a , b ) , but has been challenging for more divergent groups of viruses. Sequence analysis alone has not provided a reliable single criterion on which all viruses may be classifi ed. Construction of a universal phylogenetic tree for viruses, as has been proposed for cellular life-forms, may not be possible for viruses. It is not clear that all viruses emerged from a single progenitor virus; there is evidence for multiple, independent origins of existing viruses. Phylogenetic analysis using nucleic acid sequences is further complicated by recombination, reassortment, incorporation of host nucleic acid sequences, and other factors (Domingo 2007 ; Holmes 2011 ) . Currently, expert consensus, considering laboratory, phenotypic, clinical, and other characteristics, remains the most accurate and robust method for the classifi cation and taxonomic assignment of viruses. Note that the formal names assigned at all taxonomic levels are italicized, while the common names, which are often used clinically, are not italicized.

The envelope may be derived from multiple types of hostcell membranes during transit from the nucleus through the cytoplasm; specifi c viralencoded glycoproteins are embedded in the envelope of the complete virions, which may be spherical or pleomorphic (180-200 nm in diameter). VZV has a class D dsDNA genome (~125 kbp) (Clarke et al. 1995 ; Davison 1984 ) , resulting in production of two isomeric genomic forms by infected cells through inversion of the US region (Ecker and Hyman 1982 ) . The genome encodes more than 70 proteins. The organization includes grouping of several genes into single transcription units, genes with overlapping reading frames, and spliced segments (Davison and Scott 1986 ) . The species designation for VZV is Human herpesvirus 3 . It is the type species of the genus Varicellovirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae . There is only a single serotype of VZV. For epidemiologic purposes, VZV isolates may be genotyped on the basis of minor differences in DNA sequence; different genotypes may be classifi ed as European, Japanese, or Mosaic (Loparev et al. 2004 ). The host range of VZV is restricted to cells of humans or other primates; in humans, VZV has tropism for human T-lymphocytes and establishes latent infection in the cells of the dorsal root ganglia. Orthomyxoviridae : Infl uenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae . They are polymorphic; viruses may be spherical (~100 nm diameter) or fi lamentous. Complete virions are surrounded by an envelope derived from the host cytoplasmic membrane. Viral hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins are embedded in the envelope resulting in characteristic 10-14 nm spikes projecting from the surface of virions. In addition to the HA and NA protein, M2 protein is embedded into the envelope of Infl uenza A viruses; NB and BM2 proteins are embedded into the envelopes of Infl uenza B viruses. The matrix protein (M1) is located just below the envelope. The nucleocapsid is composed of viral RNA and nonstructural proteins, including ribonucleoproteins and polymerases.",

Large outbreaks have only occurred with H1, H2, and H3 and neuraminidases N1 and N2 viral subtypes. Antigenic drift and antigenic shift contribute to reinfection with infl uenza viruses (Taubenberger and Kash 2010 ) . Antigenic drift is caused by a gradual accumulation of point mutations in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, which result in minor antigenic changes in these proteins. Antigenic shift is caused by a virus created by reassortment of infl uenza virus RNA segments during coinfection of a host, usually with a human infl uenza virus and an avian or swine infl uenza virus or through introduction of a nonhuman infl uenza virus strain into human populations after mutation during a host-species infection creates a new isolate permissive for interspecies transmission.",

There are six to ten genes; genes for the six major proteins are linked in the following 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 order: nucleocapsid (N) \u2192 phosphoprotein (P) \u2192 matrix (M) \u2192 fusion (F) \u2192 hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) \u2192 large polymerase (L).

Translation is initiated at the 3\u2032 end and proceeds directly through to the 5\u2032 end. Because the RNA polymerase is unstable and may detach at the untranslated regions between genes, there is a gradient in the concentration of gene products from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032.

At a very basic level, these systems allow clinicians and scientists to communicate effectively and ensure the comparability of data generated by clinical or basic scientifi c studies. Further, accurate and standardized data is critical for understanding issues related to transmission, prevention, and treatment of viral illnesses. Establishing phylogenetic similarity to known viral pathogens may allow clinicians to anticipate the clinical behavior of new and emerging viral pathogens, as may be seen when virus mutation results in acquisition of new pathogenic mechanisms, like changes to antigens associated with evasion of the immune response of the host species or changes that allow a viral pathogen to jump from one species into new, susceptible species. As analytical tools improve, even more informative data relevant to clinical and pathologic characteristics of viral pathogens is anticipated.",
