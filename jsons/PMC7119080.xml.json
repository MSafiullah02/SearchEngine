This infectious disease originated in Southern China and Hong Kong in late 2002, and then rapidly spread to over 25 countries.1 The most common symptoms of SARS are cough, high fever (>38 \u00b0C), chills, rigor, myalgia, headache, dizziness, as well as progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphopenia. The disease had a quite high mortality rate (up to 15\u201319%) during the initial outbreak. Death may result from progressive respiratory failure owing to alveolar damage. In early 2003, a novel human coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of SARS, and the virus was named SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV).2 To date, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine has been marketed for treating SARS, although steroid and ribavirin have been used empirically in hospitals of Hong Kong,3, 4 and an HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir could decrease the replication of SARS CoV in a preliminary in vitro examination.5\n",

The carbonyl group of isatin and the NH groups in Cys145, Ser144, and Gly143 of protease were hydrogen bonded. On the other hand, steric effect in isatin scaffold is crucial for ensuring inhibitory potency. Therefore, the inhibitors with a bulkier side chain (4u\u2013z) are less potent than compound 4o because of the limited space between the R4 of isatin and the His164 and Met165 of protease. Computational studies also demonstrated that the inhibitory potency depended heavily on hydrophobicity and electron affinity of the substituted groups in isatin. For example, compounds with nonpolar and more electron withdrawing groups such as bromo and nitro in R3 (4i and 4k) are significantly more potent than the compound with an amino group in R3 (4j).",

However, isatin 4k inhibited chymotrypsin at unexpectedly low IC50 value compared with compound 4o (10.4 \u03bcM vs 1.00 mM). Consequently, 4k is less specific for SARS CoV 3CLpro than 4o. Computer docking of compound 4o has slightly better (0.2 kcal/mol) binding affinity for SARS CoV 3CLpro. The slight difference might be the reason that compound 4o is more specific than compound 4k for other proteases.",
