            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the condition of elevated pressures in the pulmonary circulation. PH can develop acutely in patients with critical illness such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, massive pulmonary embolism, left ventricular dysfunction, or after surgery. In a cancer patient, unique etiologies such as myeloproliferative disorders, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or tumor emboli may result in PH. Early recognition and treatment of the causative condition may reverse acute PH or return chronic PH to its baseline status. Progression of the disease or its decompensation due to infection, a thromboembolic event, or other triggers can lead to admission to an intensive care unit. Regardless of etiology, the development or worsening of PH may precipitate hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability, or right ventricular failure, which can be challenging to manage or even fatal. In select cases, rapid institution of advanced treatment modalities may be warranted. This chapter reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of PH and presents a comprehensive analysis of PH and right heart failure management strategies in the critical care setting. In particular, a unique perspective on oncologically relevant PH is provided.",

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents a complex and challenging dimension in the management of critically ill patients. Historically, the left heart was considered to be the only pump and the dominant force in the cardiovascular system, while the right heart was seen as a passive conduit through which blood flowed for reoxygenation. The function and importance of the right ventricle (RV) is now much better understood, largely due to the growing experience with right ventricular failure (RVF). Moreover, recent studies have identified RV function as a major determinant of outcomes including mortality, especially after myocardial infarction, in acute pulmonary embolism, and in moderate left heart failure [26] . In the intensive care unit (ICU), acute RV dysfunction has been well described with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and a decompensated RV, especially in those with chronic PH, portends limited survival [13] . Thus, early detection and treatment of PH and impending RVF can significantly improve outcomes. The RV differs from the left ventricle in both structure and function, and management of a failing RV is fundamentally different. Distinct etiologies for PH exist in the oncologic patient. The purpose of this chapter is to review the etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical features of PH in the oncologic patient, followed by a broad discussion of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management strategies, and prognosis for subsequent RVF in the critical care setting.",

In addition, PH was found in up to 60% of patients with severe systolic heart failure, up to 70% in those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, up to 65% in those with symptomatic aortic stenosis, and in practically everyone with severe symptomatic mitral valve disease [47, 65] . WHO group 2 PH is associated with mean left atrial pressures of >14 mmHg which can result in pulmonary venous hypertension, also known as post-capillary PH. Conditions in this category include left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, constrictive pericarditis, left atrial myxoma, valvular disease, congenital or acquired left heart inflow/outflow tract obstruction, and congenital cardiomyopathies. Chemotherapyinduced cardiotoxicity may occur in patients having received anthracycline-based regimens, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, alkylating agents, or taxanes [79] . Radiation fields that involve the heart may also accelerate coronary atherosclerosis and induce acute or chronic pericardial disease, valvular heart disease, conduction system disease, and cardiomyopathy [92] . Young age and left anterior thoracic radiation place patients at higher risk for cardiac damage [31] . Infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis may also manifest with restrictive cardiomyopathy or PH.",

ARDS promotes hypoxic vasoconstriction, increases alveolar dead space, and releases pro-inflammatory cytokines and pulmonary microthrombi, all of which may result in RVF in up to 30-56% of cases [28] . Predictors of RVF in ARDS include pneumonia-induced ARDS, partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <150, partial pressure of carbon dioxide >47 mmHg, and a driving pressure (end-inspiratory plateau pressure minus the positive end-expiratory pressure, PEEP) >18 cm H 2 O [61] . Pneumonitis from infections, aspiration, radiation therapy, or drugs can also cause hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction resulting in PH. A myriad of chemotherapeutic agents including anti-epidermal growth factor receptor, smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, anti-lymphocyte monoclonal antibodies, and even immunotherapy may result in lung injury [3, 71] . Degree of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency may be compounded if new infiltrates are superimposed on underlying COPD, ILD, or metastatic or primary lung cancer.",

            "text": "Cancer is a well-known cause of venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism may certainly present with PH and, potentially, hemodynamic instability. In a large populationbased, case-controlled study to identify risk factors for venous thrombosis, a sevenfold increase in patients with malignancy compared to patients without malignancy was found [7] . Interestingly, there was a 28-fold increase in those with hematologic malignancies, followed by lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. Certain anti- angiogenic agents such as thalidomide and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors such as bevacizumab may increase the incidence of pulmonary emboli during therapy. Cancer patients often have incidental pulmonary emboli on routine imaging. CTEPH has been described in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease, subsequently treated with pulmonary vasodilator therapy or thromboendarterectomy [30] . The incidence of CTEPH in cancer populations has not been established, likely due to limitation in longterm follow-up. PH due to mixed or unclear mechanisms in miscellaneous malignant and nonmalignant conditions is classified under WHO group 5. Such conditions include hematologic disorders (chronic hemolytic anemia, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy), systemic disorders (sarcoidosis, pulmonary histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis), metabolic disorders (glycogen storage diseases, Gaucher disease, thyroid disorders), as well as tumoral obstruction, fibrosing mediastinitis, chronic renal failure, and segmental PH. Chronic myeloproliferative disorders comprise a rare cause of PH. The potential mechanisms include splenectomy, direct obstruction of pulmonary arteries, chronic thromboembolism, portal hypertension, high cardiac output, and left heart failure [80] . Attributing PH solely to chronic myeloproliferative disease is difficult, as many of the reported cases did not have a right heart catheterization (RHC) needed to definitively diagnose PAH and rule out other causes such as left heart disease [54] . Multiple myeloma has also been associated with PH with potential etiologies that include concomitant amyloidosis, left heart dysfunction, chronic kidney failure, and treatment-related toxicities [50] . Other etiologies of PH in group 5 may be from obstruction of pulmonary vasculature from metastatic disease or primary tumors of the pulmonary vasculature (e.g., pulmonary artery sarcoma), or fibrosing mediastinitis due to previous radiation therapy or fungal infection such as histoplasmosis. Finally, an autopsy series has estimated that 6 to 26% of patients with solid tumors, primarily adenocarcinoma, have pulmonary tumor emboli [74] , and these patients may sometimes present antemortem with acute or subacute cor pulmonale [23] .",

PAH has a progressive clinical course studded with episodes of acute decompensation, eventually leading to severe symptoms and heart failure. Death from PAH may occur suddenly in an outof-hospital setting or slowly from inexorable right heart failure, often necessitating a hospitalization and, frequently, an ICU admission.

PAH patients carry a very large risk of mortality when surgery becomes emergent; and preoperative RV dysfunction, a higher NYHA functional class with worse exercise tolerance, and longer and more intricate surgery are associated with worse outcomes [68] . Induction of general anesthesia poses significant risks due to vasodilation and systemic hypotension, as well as adverse effects of positive pressure ventilation. Additively, surgery itself poses the usual risks, which patients with PAH are hemodynamically less equipped to tolerate. These surgical risks include fluid shifts, the need for continuous anesthetic use and neuromuscular blockade, and unfavorable positioning affecting lung volumes, all with resultant hypoventilation and hypoxemia that raise RV afterload [68] .

An important lesson from the current registries is the realization that subpopulations of PAH have significantly different outcomes and that overall survival has improved in the current era of new emerging treatments [58] . The prevalence of idiopathic (IPAH) and heritable PAH (HPAH) is estimated at 5-15 per one million in the general population [43, 52, 58] , while European registries estimate prevalence of PAH at 5-52 per one million [2, 47, 66] . The mean age of patients with idiopathic PAH has risen from 36 years to a mean age at diagnosis between 50 and 65 years in the current registries. In addition, the usual female predominance is less certain among older patients. Presentation to the ICU with RVF due to undiagnosed PAH has become increasingly rare and can be explained by improved awareness and earlier recognition of PAH. Furthermore, the newer PAH therapies have stabilized outpatient PAH and may have improved survival; thus ICU admissions are now more frequently due to triggering factors than decompensated PAH itself.",

The RV pumps the entire systemic venous return into the highly compliant, low-resistance pulmonary circulation for gas exchange. In addition, the RV is easily distensible and can accommodate various changes in venous return due to posture, volume status, and respiration while maintaining adequate cardiac output [27] . The interaction of the forces transmitted from one ventricle to the other through the myocardium and pericardium is referred to as ventricular interdependence, and it is vital for ventricular synchrony [29, 41] . The pressure difference between the two ventricles is referred to as the transseptal gradient and is typically around 100 mmHg [82] . The pressure in the LV is normally much higher than in the RV, and the interventricular septum (IVS) in its normal state bulges into the RV, acting as a splint against which the RV contracts.",

Sepsis can exacerbate the underfilled RV with a low effective intravascular volume. Subsequent initiation of mechanical ventilation further increases intrathoracic pressures and negatively affects venous return, and the effect may be augmented with high levels of PEEP. Conversely, factors that excessively increase venous return result in volume overload for the RV, leading to tension and possible ischemia of its free wall, stretching of the tricuspid valve annulus, and flattening and bowing of the IVS into the LV. Thus, the RV cardiac output decreases and negatively affects LV filling and cardiac output as well. Conditions that manifest with an increased RV preload include tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, atrial septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return, and states of overall volume overload such as renal failure or after resuscitation for shock. Myocardial depression and decreased LV contractility often occur with sepsis in part due to oxygen supply and demand mismatch [40] and in part because of the effects of circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha [8, 25] . As a result, the RV develops diastolic dysfunction as well as decreased contractility by the ",

Conditions that affect the pulmonary circulation by increasing the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) include acute pulmonary embolism, RV outflow tract obstruction, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary stenosis, and all chronic forms of PH. Sepsis causes vasoactive, microthrombotic, and inflammatory damage to the pulmonary circulation, raising the PVR [68] . In the ICU, volume loss (atelectasis, consolidation, pleural effusions, mainstem intubation) and overdistension (dynamic hyperinflation, high tidal volumes or PEEP) as well as acidemia, hypercarbia, hypoxemia, and hypothermia may also raise the PVR [82] . Alveolar hypoxia leads to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, decreased nitric oxide (NO), and increased endothelin production in the pulmonary circulation, causing further local vasoconstriction [25] Lastly, disseminated intravascular coagulation, commonly part of sepsis, may cause microthrombi to form in the pulmonary arterial tree [9] .",

In conditions of acute RV failure, such as during a massive PE, pressure in the pulmonary vascular bed rapidly increases, thus causing RV pressure to increase. Although the RV can dilate to accommodate the increased preload, its thin free wall precludes adequate acute adaptation to increased afterload. Once myocyte recruitment per the Frank-Starling mechanism has been maximized, any further increase in afterload will trigger a precipitous decrease in RV contractile function [27] . The dilated RV free wall experiences increased tension and ischemia, which further reduces free wall contractility. RV dilatation also results in stretching of the tricuspid annulus with subsequent tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The pericardial pressure also rises concurrently with the rising RV pressures and can constrain the cardiac chambers, further reducing their compliance, filling, and output [32] .",

It is important to note that venous congestion seen with an overdistended RV and that from reduced cardiac output from RV underfilling may have similar presentations, which necessitates accurate measurement of CVP. In certain complex cases, such as a mixed shock state, a case where trending PVR and PCWP are important, or post cardiac surgery, a pulmonary artery catheter may be necessary to optimize management of RVF.",

Sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome are notorious culprits of PH in the ICU. In patients with septic shock, empiric antimicrobial therapy and identification of infectious etiology are vital. Institution of high-flow oxygen or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may help stabilize patients with hypoxic or hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary embolism and hemodynamic compromise should be evaluated for systemic thrombolytics, and in nonresponders or those who cannot receive them, surgical embolectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, as well as mechanical circulatory support devices such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and right ventricular assist devices (RVAD) can be considered when appropriate [48, 56, 76, 88] . Ensuring that RV ischemia is not a result of an acute coronary syndrome is important since rapid revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention could be necessary to restore RV perfusion. Prompt cessation of any pharmacologic agents that may have precipitated PH, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy, anorexigens, or illicit drugs, is imperative. The use of steroids and/or nebulized therapy could be a part of the treatment for exacerbations of COPD or ILD. In cases of PAH therapy withdrawal, restarting pulmonary vasodilators is crucial. In those with suspected CTEPH, review with and/or referral to a specialized surgical center for consideration of pulmonary endarterectomy is imperative. Finally, continuous vigilance to correct metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia is vital to sustain RV contractility negatively affected by these factors.",

High-flow oxygen may be especially useful in avoiding or preventing intubation. In those with underlying lung disease or concomitant left heart dysfunction, noninvasive positive pressure therapy may help reduce the labor of breathing and improve ventilation. Positive airway pressure, however, can negatively affect RV function. In those with hemodynamic instability, altered mentation, or persistent hypoxemia, intubation with mechanical ventilation may be unavoidable despite its risks of significant metabolic and hemodynamic adverse effects. Hypotension with induction is common from sedating agents and neuromuscular blockade, and it may also occur from withdrawal of the potent sympathetic drive when work of breathing is relieved. Lastly, placing the patient in the supine position worsens hypoxemia through physiologic shunting. Therefore, in cases of decompensated PH and RVF, intubation should be avoided if at all possible. When intubation is necessary, precautions must be taken to prevent hypotension, acidosis, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia. Typically, medications that are considered relatively safe to use include opiates, benzodiazepines, etomidate, and ketamine at the lowest effective doses. If possible, propofol and paralysis should be avoided to prevent hypotension or, if needed, should be co-administered with a vasopressor empirically to prevent hypotension.

Attaining and maintaining optimal lung volumes is crucial as both overdistension and atelectasis of lung units increase the PVR. Atelectatic alveoli compress extraalveolar vessels, resulting in an increase in PVR. Overdistension of alveoli compresses intraalveolar vessels, still causing an increase in PVR [11] .

For those patients with chronic PAH, all chronic pulmonary vasodilator therapy should be resumed. In patients with decompensated PAH and RVF, intravenous or inhaled prostanoids should be emergently initiated, and ideally invasive monitoring should be started to guide titration based on hemodynamic measures. Concurrent inotropic support with dobutamine or dopamine, as well as vasopressor support with norepinephrine or vasopressin, may be necessary during this process to maintain hemodynamic stability. Targets of end-organ perfusion such as lactic acid, ScvO2, urine output, and liver function tests should also be serially monitored.

An acute event (A) triggers right ventricular pressure and volume overload and dysfunction (B), causing flattening of the interventricular septum (black arrow). Subsequently, the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure begins to rise, the right ventricle begins to dilate (C), and tricuspid regurgitation worsens. As the interventricular septum further bows into the left ventricle with concomitant pericardial constriction (pink arrows), the right ventricle becomes ischemic from decreased perfusion and begins to fail (D), dropping its cardiac output (blue arrow). The failing right ventricle then compromises left ventricular filling (E), causing rising left ventricular end-diastolic pressures and left ventricular failure. As systemic cardiac output drops (red arrow), ensuing hypotension results in multi-organ failure and possibly death.
