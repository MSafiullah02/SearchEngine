Useful taxonomic systems should be broadly applicable across diverse types of biological groups.

Primary goals of systemic taxonomy, regardless of biological discipline, include the following:Establishing groups (taxa) that reflect varying degrees of evolutionary relatedness among the different biological entities studiedEstablishing criteria for assignment of known or unknown clinical isolates to a given groupEstablishing a clear and unequivocal nomenclature\n",

Early taxonomic systems relied on gross characteristics, like biological niche, internal and external morphology, reproductive strategies and compatibilities, and fossil records. The seminal works of the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus used a hierarchical scheme to represent biological relatedness and established the simplified binomial system of nomenclature that serves as the basis for modern classification systems. The modern scientific classification in biology is designed to describe all biological entities within a hierarchy consisting of the following taxa:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\begin{array}{l} Domain\\to Kingdom\\to Phylum\\to Class\\to \\\\ {} Order\\to Family\\to Genus\\to Species\\end{array} $$\n\\end{document}Domain\u2192Kingdom\u2192Phylum\u2192Class\u2192Order\u2192Family\u2192Genus\u2192Species\n",

Different biological entities have evolved as a result of accumulated changes in DNA that have provided survival advantages in different ecological niches. Species may be classified on the basis of phylogenetic and evolutionary relatedness: members of a given species are the most closely related, different species within a single genus are more closely related to each other than to a species within a different genus, and so on. Newer technologies like microscopy, improved biochemical and physiological analysis, and advanced protein and molecular analytical methods have resulted in an enormous expansion of characteristics that may be studied for the classification of biological entities and validation of taxonomic systems (Woese et al. 1990).",

Though viruses are certainly \u201cbiological entities,\u201d they are fundamentally different from the cellular life-forms classified by previous taxonomic schemes. Viruses have no autonomous metabolic or replicative ability; they are completely dependent on cellular life-forms. However, within their biological milieu, viruses do replicate and evolve, and they are composed of the same types of organic macromolecules as are cellular life-forms. Because of their intimate relationship with cellular life-forms, it seems legitimate to integrate the schemes for classification of viruses with the schemes used for biological classification of cellular life-forms (Lefkowitz 2012). Initially, various features, like host range, cross-immunity, clinical disease, and pathologic features, were used to classify viruses. Technological advances have led to more detailed and integrated classification, taxonomy, and phylogenetic characterization (evolutionary relatedness) of viruses. Sophisticated nucleic acid sequence analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for virus classification and phylogenetic determination, in spite of some limitations (Holmes 2008; McCormack and Clewley 2002; Zanotto et al. 1996).",

A virus species is defined as a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a specific ecological niche (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2002). In polythetic classifications, group members share a number of characteristics, but no single characteristic is necessary or sufficient to define members of the group. Higher-level taxa are monothetic, i.e., there are characteristics that are necessary and sufficient to define members of the class. It is important to note that not all viruses can be assigned through all taxonomic levels. Virus species may be assigned to a genus or remain unassigned. Similarly, a genus may be assigned to a family or subfamily, or remain unassigned, and so on up the taxonomic hierarchy. Each genus has a type species. The type species is the virus that necessitated the creation of the genus; it is always linked to the genus.",

            "text": "In the most recent publication (2012), the ICTV recognized 7 orders, 96 families, 22 subfamilies, 420 genera, and 2,618 species. Important characteristics used by the ICTV to define and classify viruses within these taxa include the following:\nSusceptible Host Range: Most viruses have a restricted range of hosts which they are able to infect.\nVirus Structure: The viral genome is surrounded by a protective shell of proteins called a capsid. The capsid may also enclose proteins, like reverse transcriptase or proteins required for organization of the nucleocapsid. A nucleocapsid refers to a viral nucleus surrounded by an intact capsid. The nucleocapsids of certain viruses are also surrounded by an envelope of host-derived membranes. The complete virus particle is referred to as a virion.Icosahedral capsids are very common; these quasi-spherical shells are composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles with 30 edges and 12 vertices. Icosahedral capsids are very efficient geometrically (internal volume versus protein content) and genetically (many small sides require fewer and smaller genes to code for capsid proteins). The nucleocapsid proteins of some viruses, like the influenza viruses, form helical tubes with the nucleic acid incorporated directly into the helical structure.The nucleocapsids of some viruses are surrounded by envelopes composed of lipid bilayers and host- or viral-encoded proteins. Envelopes are typically acquired by budding of the nucleocapsid through a virally modified portion of a specific host-cell membrane (plasma, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, nucleus).The shape of the virus nucleocapsid or intact virion is usually determined by electron microscopy. The shape and dimensions of the nucleocapsid and intact virion, and the presence or absence of an envelope, are useful characteristics for classifying viruses.\nGenome: The viral genome is either DNA or RNA; the nucleic acids may be single or double stranded. The genome size may be expressed in terms of kilobases (kb) for single-stranded genomes or kilobase pairs (kbp) for double-stranded genomes. The sequence of genes of positive-sense ssRNA may be directly translated by the host into viral proteins. The sequence of negative-sense ssRNA is complementary to the coding sequence for translation, so mRNA must be synthesized by RNA polymerase, typically carried within the virion, before translation into viral proteins. The sequence of positive-sense ssDNA is the same as that of the mRNA coding for viral proteins; negative-sense ssDNA is complementary to mRNA and may be transcribed into mRNA for viral protein synthesis. Ambisense single-stranded nucleic acids use both positive-sense and negative-sense sequences. The viral nucleic acid may be linear or circular; the nucleic acid may be in the form of a single molecule or broken into two or more segments.In addition to the type of nucleic acid, the size of the viral genome, measured in number of bases or base pairs, is an important characteristic used for classification.\nNucleic Acid Sequence Analysis: The analysis of specific viral nucleic acid sequences is increasingly used as a powerful tool for taxonomic assignment and assessment of evolutionary relatedness. The utility is greatest for related groups of viruses (Lauber and Gorbalenya2012a, b), but has been challenging for more divergent groups of viruses. Sequence analysis alone has not provided a reliable single criterion on which all viruses may be classified. Construction of a universal phylogenetic tree for viruses, as has been proposed for cellular life-forms, may not be possible for viruses. It is not clear that all viruses emerged from a single progenitor virus; there is evidence for multiple, independent origins of existing viruses. Phylogenetic analysis using nucleic acid sequences is further complicated by recombination, reassortment, incorporation of host nucleic acid sequences, and other factors (Domingo 2007; Holmes 2011).\n",

The positive-sense genome is directly translated into a large polyprotein, which undergoes intra- and post-translational cleavage. Strain evolution and clinical diversity have been driven by a high rate of mutation at replication and through molecular recombination.

            "text": "The herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses. The icosahedral capsid (~100 nm diameter) is surrounded by an envelope studded by a variety of short glycoproteins. The nucleocapsid is a dense toroid complex with an outer diameter ~70 nm and inner diameter ~18 nm. An irregular \u201ctegument\u201d fills the space between the envelope and capsid. Depending of the thickness of the tegument layer, complete virions range in size from ~125 to >250 nm. The size and organization of the dsDNA genome varies among the species causing human disease (McGeoch et al. 2006). The genomes of human herpesviruses include unique sequences and repeated sequences. Though the genomes are linear in virions, they circularize in the nucleus of infected cells, which is mediated through repeat sequences at both ends of the dsDNA genome. For HHV6 and HHV7 (class A genome), a large unique sequence region is flanked by a region that is repeated at both ends of the linear strand of dsDNA. The genome of EBV and the Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (class C genome) have smaller left and right terminal repeat sequences, while repeat sequences R1 to R4 divide the unique sequence nucleic acid into four discrete regions. For VZV (class D genome), a large terminal sequence is inverted and inserted into the genome, resulting in a large unique sequence region (UL) and a small unique sequence region (US). HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV (class E genomes) are the most complex. There are repeat sequence regions at both ends of the linear dsDNA molecule. The unique sequence dsDNA is divided into UL and US regions by a sequence composed of juxtaposed copies of the terminal repeat sequences inserted in an inverted orientation.",

A characteristic of herpesvirus infections is latency, which is commonly associated with reactivation and symptomatic infections (e.g., shingles). While active infection with herpesviruses results in the destruction of the infected host cell, latently infected cells remain viable. In latently infected cells, the viral genome forms circularized molecules within the host nucleus with limited expression of viral genes.\nCytomegalovirus: Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is the most complex human herpesvirus. The complete virions of human cytomegalovirus range in diameter from ~200 to 300 nm. The Golgi-derived envelope is studded with 20 or more virally encoded glycoproteins. The icosahedral nucleocapsid (~125 nm) includes five capsid proteins enclosing a class E genome (~230 kbp linear dsDNA) (Davison et al. 2003b; Dunn et al. 2003), as described above. The hCMV tegument is composed of at least 27 virally encoded proteins and other viral and host-cell macromolecules.\n",

            "text": "The species designation of hCMV is Human herpesvirus 5 in the genus Cytomegalovirus (for which it is the type species) and subfamily Betaherpesvirinae.\nEpstein-Barr Virus: The morphology of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV) is typical of other herpesviruses: a single glycoprotein is predominant in the envelope. The EBV virions contain a type C genome (172 kbp). The genome encodes more than 70 proteins, including the core herpesvirus genes, as well as species-specific genes (Baer et al. 1984). The primary target of EBV is the B-lymphocyte, in which long-term latency is established. Lytic infection of epithelial cells is primarily responsible for transmission of infection.The species designation of EBV is Human herpesvirus 4 in the genus Lymphocryptovirus (for which it is the type species) and subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. Oncogenic potential is a characteristic of the Gammaherpesvirinae and is well documented for EBV. There are two types of EBV, which can be detected by serological reactions directed against nuclear antigens. Type 1 EBV isolates are most prevalent in the United States and other developed countries; both type 1 and 2 EBVs are seen in African isolates.\nHerpes Simplex Viruses: Complete HSV virions are ~225 nm in diameter with a spiked outer surface caused by 11 viral glycoproteins. The icosahedral nucleocapsid is eccentrically placed within the envelope. The HSV linear genome (150\u2013155 kbp) has a class E organization (Mocarski and Roizman 1981). Reading frames are present on both DNA strands. Individual reading frames may be embedded in larger reading frames, and antisense reading frames are used for several proteins. Several transcripts are formed by RNA splicing. Transcription switches from host cell to viral genes within several hours after infection.Two distinct herpes simplex viruses can be recognized by antigenic and genetic differences (Dolan et al. 1998): Human herpesvirus 1 and Human herpesvirus 2. These viruses are assigned to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the genus Simplex virus; Human herpesvirus 1 is the type species. Human herpes simplex viruses are able to infect cells of many different organ systems.\nHHV-6 and HHV-7: The genome (~170 kbp for HHV-6; ~150 kbp for HHV-7) is contained by a 90\u2013110 nm icosahedral capsid. Tegumented capsids released from the nucleus are enveloped by cytoplasmic vacuoles; six viral glycoproteins are embedded in the envelope of complete virions. Cell-free virions are 170\u2013200 nm in diameter. The class A genome (Gompels et al. 1995) of these viruses has the simplest organization and lowest %G + C content compared to the other herpesviruses. Reading frames are present on each strand of the dsDNA. Core herpesvirus proteins are clustered near the center of the strands, while species-specific genes are located toward the ends of the strands (Braun et al. 1997).HHV-6 and HHV-7 are assigned to the genus Roseolovirus in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. There are two distinct HHV-6 species: Human herpesvirus 6A (the Roseolovirus type species) and Human herpesvirus 6B. HHV-6B is the agent of exanthem subitum. There is a single HHV-7 species, Human herpesvirus 7, which is also a cause of exanthem subitum. T-lymphocytes are the primary target cell of HHV-6 and HHV-7 viruses.\nKaposi\u2019s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (HHV-8): The complete virions of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) have a diameter ~100 nm. In addition to virus-specific proteins, the tegument also carries viral mRNAs, probably the result of passive incorporation during the cytoplasmic envelopment process (Bechtel et al. 2005). The envelopes of complete virions bear KSHV-specific glycoproteins. The genome (~170 kbp) has class C organization (Russo et al. 1996) typical of Gammaherpesvirinae. The conserved herpesvirus genes are clustered in four blocks; KSHV-specific genes are typically distributed in the regions outside and between these blocks (Renne et al. 1996).The KSHV species designation is Human herpesvirus 8, which is assigned to the genus Rhadinovirus within the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. The virus has tropism for B-lymphocytes and is implicated in all forms of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Four clades, A\u2013D, with distinctive geographical distributions, have been identified by genotypic analysis; the A and C clades cluster together and are most typical for isolates from Europe and the United States.\nVaricella-Zoster Virus (VZV): The dense core of VZV is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid (80\u2013120 nm diameter), which is surrounded by an amorphous tegument. The envelope may be derived from multiple types of host-cell membranes during transit from the nucleus through the cytoplasm; specific viral-encoded glycoproteins are embedded in the envelope of the complete virions, which may be spherical or pleomorphic (180\u2013200 nm in diameter). VZV has a class D dsDNA genome (~125 kbp) (Clarke et al. 1995; Davison 1984), resulting in production of two isomeric genomic forms by infected cells through inversion of the US region (Ecker and Hyman 1982). The genome encodes more than 70 proteins. The organization includes grouping of several genes into single transcription units, genes with overlapping reading frames, and spliced segments (Davison and Scott 1986).The species designation for VZV is Human herpesvirus 3. It is the type species of the genus Varicellovirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. There is only a single serotype of VZV. For epidemiologic purposes, VZV isolates may be genotyped on the basis of minor differences in DNA sequence; different genotypes may be classified as European, Japanese, or Mosaic (Loparev et al. 2004). The host range of VZV is restricted to cells of humans or other primates; in humans, VZV has tropism for human T-lymphocytes and establishes latent infection in the cells of the dorsal root ganglia.\n",

Antigenic shift is caused by a virus created by reassortment of influenza virus RNA segments during coinfection of a host, usually with a human influenza virus and an avian or swine influenza virus or through introduction of a nonhuman influenza virus strain into human populations after mutation during a host-species infection creates a new isolate permissive for interspecies transmission.",

The viral RNA serves as template for synthesis of mRNA and for synthesis of antigenomic (positive-sense) RNA for synthesis of new viral negative-sense RNA for new virions. There are six to ten genes; genes for the six major proteins are linked in the following 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 order: nucleocapsid (N) \u2192 phosphoprotein (P) \u2192 matrix (M) \u2192 fusion (F) \u2192 hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) \u2192 large polymerase (L). There is an untranslated leader sequence at the 3\u2032 end and untranslated trailer sequence at the 5\u2032 end. The genes are separated by untranslated sequences and do not overlap, with the exception of the M and L genes of Human metapneumovirus. Translation is initiated at the 3\u2032 end and proceeds directly through to the 5\u2032 end. Because the RNA polymerase is unstable and may detach at the untranslated regions between genes, there is a gradient in the concentration of gene products from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032. In different species, other proteins are produced by additional small genes, mRNA editing, or overlapping reading frames within the P gene. The V and C proteins regulate viral RNA transcription and also interfere with host interferon signaling and other aspects of the immune response to paramyxovirus infection (Andrejeva et al. 2004; Durbin et al. 1999; Swedan et al. 2009).",

            "text": "The Paramyxoviridae are one of the four families within the order Mononegavirales and include significant and frequent pathogens of humans and animals. There are two subfamilies: the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. There are seven genera and thirty-one species in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae and two genera and five species in the Pneumovirinae subfamily.\nHenipahviruses: In the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, there are two species within the genus Henipahvirus: Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV); HeV is the type species. Henipahvirus virions are pleomorphic (spherical to helical forms). Electron microscopy of Hendra virus shows a \u201cdouble-fringe\u201d appearance due to short and long surface projections (Hyatt et al. 2001). Complete virions range in size from 40 to 1,900 nm in longest dimension. The genome (~18 kb) includes genes typical of Paramyxoviridae. Long untranslated sequences are attached to the 3\u2032 end of five of the six genes, resulting in the larger genome size of Henipahviruses compared to other Paramyxoviruses (Eaton et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2000). The P gene also codes for V and W proteins by mRNA editing and C protein by a shifted reading frame.Henipahviruses are assigned to the family Paramyxoviridae and subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Henipahvirus infections are zoonotic; fruit bats are the presumed reservoir for Hendra virus infections, while fruit bats (Johara et al. 2001) or domesticated pigs are the presumed reservoir for Nipah virus infections.\nHuman Metapneumovirus: Three transmembrane glycoproteins, G, F, and SH proteins, are embedded in the envelope of Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) particles, resulting in 13\u201317 nm spikes. Complete virions are polymorphic with irregular helical and spherical forms (150\u2013600 nm in diameter). The organization of the hMPV genome (~13.3 kb) is similar to other paramyxoviruses (vdHoogen et al. 2002), with eight nonoverlapping genes: N, P, M, F, M2, SH, G, and L. M2 includes two open reading frames; the function of M2-1 protein is undefined, while M2-2 protein is a regulator of viral transcription. There is no gene for hemagglutinin-neuraminidase; the product of the G gene serves as the major attachment protein.Metapneumoviruses are members of the subfamily Pneumovirinae. Human metapneumovirus is a species in the genus Metapneumovirus. There is a single hMPV serotype, with two antigenic subtypes A and B.\n\nHuman Respiratory Syncytial Viruses: The envelope of Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is studded with three viral glycoproteins: G protein (the major attachment protein), F protein, and SH protein (a small hydrophobic protein). Complete virions are pleomorphic (spherical to filamentous forms). The nucleocapsid diameter, 12\u201315 nm, is smaller than typical for other paramyxoviruses (Hall 2001).The hRSV genome is ~15 kb and includes ten genes (Collins and Wertz 1983). The first eight reading frames are nonoverlapping; the last two genes, M2 and L, overlap by 62 nucleotides. In addition to N, P, and L proteins, M2-1 protein, a transcription factor, is associated with the nucleocapsid. The overall organization of the hRSV genome is similar to other paramyxoviruses. In addition to the typical genes, the hRSV genome includes genes NS1 and NS2 (nonstructural proteins that interfere with interferon induction and signaling), SH, and M2-1 and M2-2 (nonstructural proteins involved in regulation of transcription). There is no NH gene; attachment is mediated by the G gene product.\nHuman respiratory syncytial virus is the type species of the genus Pneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae. There is a single hRSV serotype, with two antigenic subtypes A and B.\n\nMeasles Virus: The envelope of measles viruses contains projections composed of viral hemagglutinin and fusion glycoproteins. Complete virions are pleomorphic and range in size from ~100 to 300 nm. The genome of Measles virus is ~16 kb in length (Dowling et al. 1986). C and V proteins are transcribed from the P gene through frame-shifted reading and mRNA editing. There is only a single serotype of Measles virus; infection confers lifelong immunity. Formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies and lack of neuraminidase activity are characteristics useful in histologically differentiating Measles virus and other morbilliviruses from other species of paramyxoviruses.\nMeasles virus is the type species of the genus Morbillivirus, within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. In addition to Measles virus, there are five other species assigned to the genus Morbillivirus, including Rinderpest virus, a closely related pathogen of cattle.\n\nParainfluenza Viruses: The lipid envelopes of the human parainfluenza viruses are studded by glycoprotein spikes (hemagglutinin/neuraminidase tetramers and fusion protein trimers). Typical virions are spherical (150\u2013200 nm); filamentous forms may be seen (Henrickson 2003).The genome of human parainfluenza viruses is ~15 kb in length with an organization and six reading frames (N, P, M, F, HN, L) typical of the Paramyxoviridae (Karron and Collins 2007). There are no overlapping reading frames. Accessory proteins, C (HPIV1 and 3), V (HPIV 2 and 4), and D (HPIV3), are produced by mRNA editing of the P gene. N proteins are tightly bound to viral and antigenomic RNA; P and L proteins are also bound to the nucleocapsid, forming functional complexes for RNA polymerization and processing.Human parainfluenza viruses are assigned to two genera in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Human parainfluenza virus 1 and Human parainfluenza virus 3 are assigned to the genus Respirovirus; the Respirovirus type species is Sendai virus. Human parainfluenza virus 2 and Human parainfluenza virus 4 belong to the genus Rubulavirus: the Rubulavirus type species is Mumps virus. The human parainfluenza viruses are serologically distinct; there is no common antigen among these viruses.\n",

The virions are non-enveloped; the icosahedral capsids (40\u201345 nm diameter) are composed of three proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3), which enclose the circular dsDNA genome (~5 kbp). The genome is divided into three regions. The early region encodes for proteins involved in viral processes that occur prior to DNA replication, including T (tumor) antigens (Benjamin 2001). The late region encodes for proteins involved in processes that primarily occur after DNA replication. The early and late regions do not overlap and are transcribed from opposite strands of the viral DNA and in opposite directions. A number of viral proteins are encoded as a result of alternative splicing and other posttranslational modifications of mRNA.",

The Orthoretrovirinae includes six genera, including Deltaretrovirus and Lentivirus. HTLV-1 is assigned the species name Primate T-lymphotropic virus 1 in the Deltaretrovirus genus. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 and HIV-2 are named Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (type species) and Human immunodeficiency virus 2, respectively, in the genus Lentivirus (Clavel et al. 1986b).\nHuman Immunodeficiency Viruses: The human immunodeficiency viruses have a conical core surrounded by an envelope derived from viral-modified host-cell cytoplasmic membrane. Binding and entry of HIV into susceptible cells requires several specific receptors: CD4 (present on host helper T cells, CD4+ macrophages, and some dendritic cells) plus chemokine receptors, including CCR5 and CXCR4 (Klatzman et al. 1984; Simmons et al. 1998). The biological properties of HIV-1 isolates depend on the chemokine coreceptor(s) used by the virus (Berger et al. 1998). Isolates that exclusively use CXCR4 are T-cell tropic with rapid replication and syncytium formation. Isolates that use CCR5 exclusively are tropic to macrophages, replicate more slowly, and do not induce syncytium formation. Isolates that can use either CXCR4 or CCR5 have intermediate phenotypes.The gag, pro, pol, and env genes are translated from full-length mRNA transcripts of the proviral genome: gag and env in one reading frame and pro and pol from a second reading frame. In addition, several genes are transcribed from overlapping or unique reading frames, including several spliced gene products.Human immunodeficiency type 1 and 2 viruses evolved from simian viruses (Gao et al. 1999; Peeters et al. 1989; Daniel et al. 1985; Marx et al. 1991). These viruses may be distinguished by a number of characteristics, including clinical disease, specific antigens, and gene sequences (Clavel et al. 1986a). HIV-1 isolates may be further characterized into genetic groups and subtypes or clades (Wainberg 2004). Most HIV-1 isolates are in the M (main) group, which has a number of well-defined subgroups and recombinant forms with heterogeneous global distribution; clade B viruses are the predominant isolates in North America and Europe (Hemelaar et al. 2006; Osmanov et al. 2002). Group O (outlier) strains have mainly been isolated or acquired in Western Africa. Group N (non-M, non-O) and recombinant forms are also most commonly isolated from Western Africa.\nHuman T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1: Mature HTLV virions have a spherical core, symmetrically placed within the envelope. The host-cell receptor is GLUT-1, a surface glucose transport molecule (Manel et al. 2003). The gag, pro, pol, and env genes are translated from full-length mRNA transcripts of the proviral genome: gag in one reading frame, pro and env from a second, and pol from a third reading frame. In addition, several spliced genes are transcribed from overlapping reading frames.\n",

At a very basic level, these systems allow clinicians and scientists to communicate effectively and ensure the comparability of data generated by clinical or basic scientific studies. Further, accurate and standardized data is critical for understanding issues related to transmission, prevention, and treatment of viral illnesses. Establishing phylogenetic similarity to known viral pathogens may allow clinicians to anticipate the clinical behavior of new and emerging viral pathogens, as may be seen when virus mutation results in acquisition of new pathogenic mechanisms, like changes to antigens associated with evasion of the immune response of the host species or changes that allow a viral pathogen to jump from one species into new, susceptible species.
