To reduce the circulation of RSV, identifying which groups are responsible for majority of the infections is critical. Transmission potential can be estimated by a combination of mixing patterns 9 and virus shedding (viral density and duration). Human experimental infection with RSV reported that volunteers inoculated with a higher dose of virus (4.7 log 10 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50 of RSV A2) were more likely to be infected than those given low doses of the inoculum (3.7 log 10 TCID 50 of RSV A2) 10 , suggesting that individuals who shed more virus are likely to be more infectious. Determining quantities shed and the related underlying factors, will help in predicting the spread of infection in a population and identify key groups to target for infection control. Previous studies have used the duration of shedding to identify individuals with the greatest potential for infection spread 11 , based on the assumption that they have a higher number of infectious contacts. Several studies report on the duration of RSV shedding with mean values ranging from 4.5 to 11.2 days 12,13 . In addition to variation in assay type, determinants included history of RSV infection 12 , age, infection severity, detection of other viruses before and during the RSV infection, and presence of concurrent RSV infections in the same household 13 . These studies and others 14,15 do not account for the temporal changes in quantity of virus shed. Experimental RSV infection studies indicate that an individual infection episode begins with low viral shedding, which rises with time as the virus continues to replicate within epithelial cells and finally declines as the infection clears 16 .",

The details of the study have been described elsewhere 13, 17, 18 . In summary, throughout an RSV season spanning 26 weeks (December 2009-June 2010), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected by trained field assistants every 3-4 days, irrespective of symptoms, from 47 RSV na\u00efve infants and their household members. Households were selected through the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) and local community health workers and were considered eligible if they had a child born after 1 st April 2009. The infants were assumed to be RSV na\u00efve because they were born after the 2008/2009 RSV season. A total of 16928 NPS collections were tested for RSV (groups A and B) and other prevalent respiratory viruses (adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses (NL63, 229E and OC43)) using multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as previously described 19 . As PCR cycles proceed the quantity of product detected rises and at some point passes through a user assigned threshold for detection (set at the point of observable exponential rise in product), known as the cycle threshold (Ct). The earlier (lower) the Ct value the higher the starting concentration of target sequence (equated with viral density). As a cut-off, samples with Ct values of 35.0 and below were considered positive. An RSV infection episode was defined as the period within which an individual provided specimens which were PCR positive for the same infecting RSV group with no more than 14 days separating any two positive samples. A household outbreak was defined as a period in which a household experienced more than one individual infection episode, without there being more than 14 days between any two infection episodes. A primary/index case was a person first identified to have an RSV infection leading to a household outbreak. A first episode was the first episode in that season that an individual had while a subsequent episode was a second or third episode that a person may have had during the follow up. Virus test results, recorded in Ct values, were converted to log 10 ribonucleic acid (RNA) copy numbers (direct measure of viral density) to enable plotting of the time -concentration curve. The equation y = -3.308x + 42.9 was used to convert Ct values (y), to their log 10 RNA equivalents (x), as a way of quantifying RNA 20 . The converted values are hereafter referred to as viral densities. Amount of virus shed during an infection episode was estimated by calculating the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule 21 , with units of copies * days. The peak viral density for each episode was identified as the highest measured viral density in an infection episode.",

This analogy can be extended to episodes with a different number of positive observations. The number of positive observations in an episode ranged from 1 to 11. a) Minimum area under curve. The minimum AUC estimate assumed that an individual started shedding on the day of the first positive sample in an infection episode, and stopped shedding on the day of the last positive sample of the episode, in the form shown in Figure 1A , with viral density Y 1 (log 10 RNA copies), and hence calculated as, AUC = 0.5 * Y 1 * 1 day.",

Possible covariates were chosen from the dataset by selecting those that could plausibly be associated with AUC. A univariable analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with AUC. All variables with a p-value of <0.1 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable regression analysis. The final multivariable regression model was developed by a backward elimination procedure, removing variables with a p-value >0.05 in each step using likelihood ratio tests. Risk factors were removed in descending order of strength of association determined from the multivariable analysis. Two interactions were tested in the multivariable model. An interaction between age and symptom status was tested to determine if the effect of age on the amount of virus shed varied by symptom status. An interaction between age and primary/secondary case status was also tested because it was suspected that the effect of age on the amount of virus shed could vary by primary/secondary case status. We chose to adjust for sex a priori because it was considered an important risk factor to acute respiratory infections 22 .",

The majority first infections are most important in virus transmission compared to subsequent infections (Table 1) . Modelling studies have been unable to determine to what extent reinfections contribute to transmission 11,23 , which has a big influence on predictions of the effect of vaccination on transmission dynamics 11 . Whilst these results do not include the opportunities to transmit, which will be generally higher for school-going children undergoing their second or third infection 9 , they suggest that people with their first episode in the season are the most likely to transmit infection when they contact susceptible individuals.

Acquired immunity (following exposure to RSV) and physiological development of the airways with age have been linked with reduced risk of severe RSV disease 12,13 . We speculate that elderly individuals are more prone to infection because of their deteriorating immune response which could explain the higher amount of virus in individuals over 40 years, compared to other adults. However, this study cannot discriminate between the two factors of young age and a first infection as the dominant factors associated with shedding (infants all had first infections, of virus available for transmission during an RSV epidemic appears to arise from individuals in their first year of life and therefore undergoing their first RSV infection episode (since all were born after the preceding RSV epidemic). Household size did not influence the per person amount of virus shed, and neither did the presence of a smoker in the household. In this rural community, indoor smoke from solid fuels (mainly firewood and charcoal) was ubiquitous and likely to conceal any specific effects of cigarette smoke. In addition, we only had 18 smokers out of the 493 participants. So, relatively few people lived with smokers. Also, we did not collect data on contact patterns of household members with the smokers or if the smoker did smoke in the house or outside which could affect the level of exposure to smoke within the households. The apparent effect of school going status on amount of virus shed was confounded by age, as school was attended by young individuals, who in turn shed more virus. RSV viral densities appeared to be low for most individuals in the beginning of the season but increased well into the season. This was a reflection of the occurrence of the RSV epidemic. Viral densities for RSV B were first to increase followed by viral densities for RSV A. RSV B infections spread to more individuals probably due to earlier onset by chance compared to RSV A infections.",

Similar patterns of shedding were reported based on shedding duration estimates using this dataset 13 and others 12,15 . These findings can provide a hint to pathogenesis of RSV disease 6 . A recent experimental study has reported disease severity to be closely related to viral load 16 even though another shows contrasting observations on disease severity and viral load link 10 . Our study showed a strong positive association between virus shedding and presence of respiratory symptoms. Symptomatic individualso shed higher amounts of virus than asymptomatic individuals irrespective of age. Overall those who were both young (<5 years) and symptomatic contributed to the highest amount of virus shed (51.8%).

However we minimize this by using a conservative approach providing three possible estimates i.e. minimum, midpoint and maximum estimates as detailed in the Supplementary Material. Furthermore, the three measures were strongly correlated and their variations by various characteristics such as age and symptoms, were comparable. Second, Ct values were converted to RNA copies using published associations 20 hence providing only a relative measure of virus density in the sample taken rather than absolute values of the amount of virus shed. Using the inverse of the Ct values as a measure of viral load did not change the distribution of AUC by various characteristics or any conclusions made from the results.",

Our approach takes into account both changing viral load and the duration of shedding making it more robust. However, its accuracy also relies on user selected thresholds for measures of viral load, and this could result in some differences in findings across studies. A quantitative PCR would be preferable. Third, there is inherent variability in estimated viral load due to variation (both biological and methodological) in the amount of virus collected using a nasopharyngeal swab. Deep NPS collections might have a higher density than perinasal swabs but events prior to sampling, e.g. sneezing, might introduce variations in sample quality. However this is likely to be non-systematic hence only conservatively affects our final conclusions. Finally, the assumption is made that virus density as measured by PCR is a measure of infectious virus. The most likely limitation of this assumption is over-estimating the duration of and peak shedding of viable virus. Generally, the relationship between the measures of viral shedding and infectiousness to other people are unknown. In the current analysis we took logarithms of estimated viral densities, under the general assumption that the risk of transmission will saturate at higher viral shedding. We then integrated over this logarithmic measure to obtain a measure of total infectiousness. An alternative would be to have integrated over the untransformed viral density, and then taken logarithms prior to statistical analysis. This approach did not give substantially different results. Estimation of the functional relationship between viral shedding and transmission is being considered in on-going analysis of the epidemics observed within households.",

This improves on existing literature that measures infectiousness using the duration of shedding only.

The introduction and rationale for the study are very clearly provided.More complicated is the analysis to determine minimum and maximum areas under the curve representing estimates of the total amount of virus shed based on a PCR cycle to detection of virus. Once this is accepted the analysis of factors influencing the amount of virus detected is straightforward and indicates age, symptoms, RSV type B, and whether infection is the initial infection during the sampling period. Each of these observations remained significant in a multiple linear regression analysis. None of these observations are surprising but all are of interest in this locale and within a community based study design. Might the large number of asymptomatic individuals include some who subsequently became symptomatic and were at the time of sampling in the incubation period of their illness?The authors address some limitations of the study. Other things that might be considered include an analysis based gradation of symptoms in terms of virus recovered, whether frequency of sampling was influenced by symptoms, and patterns of spread within families. The latter is of particular interest in that I suspect that with many viral infections the peak titre will influence spread more than the total amount shed. The number of days to detection of secondary infections in the household might give a clue to the validity of this hypothesis. ",

The interval between samples is 3-4 day, why did the author choose this big interval, while previous human challenge studies have suggested daily sampling or every 2 days could be the best follow-up (1). This is a major limitation as samples are taken only every 3-4 days and amounts of shed virus are therefore modelled based on little data and many assumptions, which may or may not equal out.

However, it was not logistically possible to collect deep nasopharyngeal swabs from ~500 participants at a more intense frequency for six months. Furthermore, community acceptability of more frequent sampling was an important issue. The following rationale was used to determine the twice-weekly (every 3.5 days) nasal sampling frequency. Assuming individuals shed virus with mean duration of between 3.5 and 9 days, with a constant rate of recovery from shedding, and an onset on average half Total AUC is the cumulative AUC for all infection episodes in a specified category eg age group. The higher number of infection episodes in the 5-15 year age group is most likely due to the higher number of individuals in this age category , and this translated to the higher total of the amount of virus shed by this age group. To compare the transmission potential per person by age group, an average amount of virus shed per infection episode might be a better statistic rather than the total AUC .
