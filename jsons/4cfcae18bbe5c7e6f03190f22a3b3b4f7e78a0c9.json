The incidence density of sepsis for the LS, IS, and HS groups were 1.17, 3.17, and 8.88 cases/1,000 person-days. After propensity score matching was done for multiple antenatal and perinatal factors, the odds ratio of death, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or death, periventricular leukomalacia, and survival without major morbidities for the HS group were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.8), 1.9 (1.5-2.4), 1.5 (1.1-2.3) and 0.7 (0.5-0.8) when compared with the IS group, and 2.2 (1.6-3.2), 2.3 (1.8-2.9), 2.0 (1.3-2.9), and 0.7 (0.6-0.9) when compared with the LS group.

However, it is still difficult to reduce the sepsis incidence to zero in NICU care because of the immature immunity systems of preterm infants and the different environments in each hospital which cannot be changed in a short time. Although the survival rate of VLBW infants is increasing by advances in neonatal care, the rate of sepsis is still higher in immature and smaller preterm infants.",

Because we did not assess whether sepsis itself is an independent risk factor of mortality, BPD, and PVL in this study, we still cannot determine whether sepsis itself was the direct leading cause of the poorer neonatal outcomes or other factors that were associated with a higher sepsis rate led to such poorer neonatal outcomes. From many previous reports, numerous evidence has shown that sepsis itself is associated with increased mortality, BPD, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Additionally, the many nationwide quality improvements by nationwide neonatal networks, such as Vermont-Oxford Network 6 and Canadian Neonatal Network 14 , to reduce sepsis in units with a high sepsis rate, especially focusing on the LOS, were the most effective in improving neonatal outcomes 6, 14 . Such a reduction in LOS also improved the survival of extremely preterm infants born at 23-26 weeks of gestation in a single tertiary hospital 15 . Moreover, quality improvement can have a spill-over effect from one outcome to another, and many common strategies are used to improve different outcomes. For example, the nosocomial infection rate was decreased not only in the evidence-based practice from improving quality methods (EPIQ) infection group but also in the EPIQ pulmonary group in the EPIQ trial by the Canadian Neonatal Network, which implies that decreasing the duration of invasive ventilator care is another important method to reduce the sepsis rate 14 . Nowadays, the Canadian Neonatal Network and Vermont-Oxford Network have adopted a multi-targeting quality improvement campaign simultaneously to improve the composite of morbidity and major neonatal outcomes, especially in extremely low GA infants 16, 17 . That is why we think that nationwide quality improvement to control sepsis should be started first in Korea, considering that we cannot start multiple strategies for quality improvement at once.",

Among the LOS infants, coagulase-negative staphylococcus www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (CONS) is known to be the most prevalent cause of sepsis 12 ; however, gram-negative or fungal sepsis is known to be associated with the highest risk of mortality or adverse outcomes in preterm infants 3, 18 . CONS is also a well-known bacteria associated with an increased risk of BPD 19, 20 . Gram-positive organisms are usually associated with catheter-related bloodstream infection, and gram-negative organisms are more commonly seen in NEC patients 18 . In our cohort, CONS was the most prevalent causal organisms of sepsis, especially in the HS group, and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of fungal sepsis between the three groups. A quality improvement program with strategies to reduce CONS sepsis such as a central catheter bundle, reducing the duration of central catheter insertion, and hand washing will be important in improving neonatal outcomes in the NICUs of South Korea. Because the duration of invasive ventilator care and the days to full feeding were longer in the HS group, reducing invasive ventilation, prompt extubation as soon as possible, and an earlier start of enteral feeding will be also helpful to reduce the sepsis rate and to improve neonatal outcomes.",

According to previous reports, number of days of central catheter insertion and total parenteral nutrition, resuscitation at birth, status of infants on admission, patient load or nurse to patient ratio were very important risk factors of sepsis 3, 9, 10 . Besides well-known risk factors of sepsis such as GA and patient status at admission, the differences in daily clinical practices caused the center-to-center variation of the sepsis rate 11 . Unfortunately, in this study, we could not get such information from the KNN database; we could only get the information about the group of mean annual number of VLBW infants registered in KNN, which showed no significant difference between three groups. When we performed the multivariate logistic regression analysis with random intercepts adjusting for GA and the hospital groups after the propensity score matching, the results were not much changed from those of the analysis with multivariate logistic regression only adjusting for GA after propensity score matching. Those groups can represent some portion or quality of the NICU size; however, more information about the NICU levels, i,e, secondary, tertiary, or quarternary units, the presence of other supporting parts such as neonatal surgery, and the presence of a perinatal center or regional NICU center are needed to be judged first whether the hospital level influences the sepsis rate. Thus, a further prospective large cohort study is needed to find such risk factors.",

It means that the disease severity of the infants in the HS group was higher than that in the LS and IS groups. Especially, between the IS and HS groups, there was no difference in the GA and birth weight; however, morbidities, duration of invasive ventilator care, and the duration of hospitalization were longer in the HS group.

We tried to compensate for those problems by performing the multivariate logistic regression analysis with random intercepts adjusting for the hospital groups divided according to the number of registered VLBWs in the KNN. Second, we still could not clearly determine whether sepsis itself or other factors associated with a higher sepsis rate led to such poorer neonatal outcomes. Further studies should be done focusing on this problem. Third, we could not collect information about the duration of central catheter use although days to full feeding can be an indicator suggesting the duration of central catheter use. We also could not get information on staff such as the nurse to patient ratio and the unit size such as tertiary or secondary hospital. Further studies will be needed to determine the risk factors that lead to the difference in the incidence of sepsis between the three groups including the staff and facilities of the NICUs. Fourth, we could not determine the order of the outcomes, so we could not determine the cause and result relationships between sepsis and other outcomes except for BPD or ROP. That' is why we performed logistic regression analysis for only death, BPD, PVL, and survival without major morbidities. Fifth, we could not get information on the duration of antibiotic use and the antibiotic resistances of each organism from our KNN database. Considering that antibiotic resistance can also be a risk factor for a longer duration of antibiotic use and disease severity, a more sophisticated design for a prospective study including such information should be done later.",

Adverse neonatal outcomes including mortality, BPD, and PVL were higher in the HS group when compared with the LS and IS groups; however, there were no significant differences between the LS and IS groups, even after the propensity score matching.

Informed consent was obtained from the parents and/or legal guardians of all the study participants at enrollment. All data collection was performed prospectively according to the guidelines and regulations of Data collection and analysis. The data for the infants were generated and analyzed from the KNN database. Mother-related variables were compared such as maternal age, multiple pregnancies, in vitro fertilization, delivery mode, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, HCA, and oligohydramnios. Neonate-related variables were also compared including GA, birthweight, gender, SGA, complete course of ACS use, delivery room resuscitation, and 1-and 5-minute Apgar scores. We also compared the distribution of groups according to the mean annual number of VLBW infants registered in KNN database.
