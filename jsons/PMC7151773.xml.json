Prokaryotes' genetic material, or DNA, is not enclosed in a cellular compartment called a nucleus as it is in eukaryotes. Not all bacteria are harmful. However, the subject of this book implies the killing of harmful bacteria. Most people know harmful bacteria best because of the diseases they cause. Some of these diseases are produced when bacteria attack directly the tissues of a plant or animal. For example, fruits and vegetables that become discolored as they are growing may be under attack by bacteria, though discoloration may also be the result of oxidation.",

They occur in animals (dogs, cows, and primates) as well as humans and are rapidly fatal once symptoms develop. Prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. When a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form. It acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more protein into prion form. This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. CJD poses a unique infection prevention problem because prions, which are protein-containing infectious agents, can survive many common sterilization processes.",

These include:\u2022\nDrying \u2013 Drying was and still is used to preserve fruit, vegetables, meats, and fish. Foods can be dried in the sun (as the ancients did), in an oven or in a food dehydrator by using the right combination of warm temperatures, low humidity, and air current. Drying removes the moisture from the food, so bacteria, yeast, and mold that need water cannot grow and spoil the food.\u2022\nChemical pickling \u2013 Food for pickling is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. There are many pickling agents including brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil (particularly olive oil). Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. In fermentation pickling, the food itself produces the preservation agent, typically by a process that produces lactic acid. This is commonly used to preserve vegetables.\u2022\nSalting \u2013 Salting has been used extensively for pork, beef, and fish. The origins of salt-preserving food can be traced back to at least ancient Egypt, where they used salt as part of the embalming process, as well as in food preservation.\n\u2022\nSugaring \u2013 Sugaring is used to preserve fruits for the winter, producing jams and jellies. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it and then packing it with pure sugar. The sugar can be crystalline table or raw sugar, or it can be a high-sugar-density liquid such as honey, syrup, or molasses.\u2022\u201cCold storage\u201d \u2013 Root cellars, ground burial, and iceboxes were cold storage methods used before the development of refrigeration.\u2022\nSmoking \u2013 Smoking is the exposure of cured meat and fish products to smoke for the purposes of preserving them and increasing their palatability by adding flavor and imparting color. The drying action of the smoke tends to preserve the meat, though many of the chemical species present in wood smoke (e.g. formaldehyde and certain alcohols) are natural preservatives as well. Smoking is one of the oldest of food preservation methods.\u2022\nCanning \u2013 Canning is a method of preserving food in which the food contents are processed and sealed in an airtight container. Canning was developed around 1810 by Nicolas Appert in Paris. It revolutionized food preservation.\u2022\nBlanching \u2013 Also known as parboiling, blanching is the method by which foods are partially cooked as a way to preserve their color, texture, and flavor.\n",

X-rays were also discovered in 1895 by W.K. Roentgen. Ionizing radiation was found to be lethal to living organisms soon after these discoveries. The idea of using ionizing radiation in food preservation almost immediately followed. The suggestion to use ionizing energy to destroy pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in food was published in a German medical journal the same year. However, the cost and quantity of this radiation inhibited commercial development until much, much later. The basic history of food irradiation follows5:\u20221905 \u2013 Scientists receive patents for a food preservative process that uses ionizing radiation to kill bacteria in food.\u20221921 \u2013 US patent is granted for a process to kill Trichinella spiral in meat by using X-ray technology.\u20221953\u20131980 \u2013 The US Government forms the National Food Irradiation Program. Under this program, the US Army and the Atomic Energy Commission sponsor many research projects on food irradiation. The US Army's interest is feeding soldiers during wartime.\u20221958 \u2013 The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended and defines sources of radiation intended for use in processing food as a new food additive. The Act is administered by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\u20221963 \u2013 FDA approves irradiation to control insects in wheat and flour.\u20221964 \u2013 FDA approves irradiation to inhibit sprouting in white potatoes.\u20221964\u20131968 \u2013 The US Army and the Atomic Energy Commission petition FDA to approve the irradiation of several packaging materials.\u20221966 \u2013 The US Army and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) petition FDA to approve the irradiation of ham.\u20221971 \u2013 FDA approves the irradiation of several packaging materials based in the 1964\u201368 petitions by the US Army and the Atomic Energy Commission.\u20221976 \u2013 The US Army contracts with commercial companies to study the wholesomeness of irradiated ham, pork, and chicken.\u20221980 \u2013 USDA inherits the US Army's food irradiation program.\u20221985 \u2013 FDA approves irradiation at specific doses to control Trichinella spiral is in pork.

The sudden deceleration of the electrons generates X-rays and waste heat. The shielding and product conveyance are similar to that of a chamber-type gamma irradiator (Fig. 1.15). The advantages of X-rays over electron beams are that they have good product penetration (over 24 inches or 60 cm of food product if irradiated on both sides).

Three terms are often used when talking about this subject and they are: sterilization, disinfection, and asepsis. Sterility and asepsis refer to different conditions. Sterility indicates the elimination (death) of all viable life forms and their germinative elements such as eggs, spores and endospores. Sterility is absolute; there is no such thing as an object being \u201cpartially sterile.\u201d Asepsis generally means that only certain types of life forms have been removed, excluded or neutralized (rendered nonviable), while the presence of other organisms may be tolerated or even promoted. For example, pasteurization of food does not kill all microorganisms in the food; it does dramatically reduce the number of microorganisms, with the intent that the pasteurized material is stored in conditions that will maintain that low number, such as refrigeration. Disinfection refers to a process whereby many or all pathogenic microorganisms are neutralized or removed. Unlike sterilization, disinfection can be achieved at varying levels as defined by the CDC:\u2022High-level disinfectants are chemical sterilants that may be used for a shorter exposure period than would be required for sterilization to kill all microorganisms with the exception of high numbers of bacterial spores.\u2022Intermediate-level disinfectants will kill mycobacteria (causes of tuberculosis and leprosy), vegetative bacteria, most viruses (such as poliovirus), and most fungi but do not kill all bacterial spores.\u2022Low-level disinfectants kill most vegetative bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses such as Staphylococcus species, Pseudomonas species, Salmonella species, HIV virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and many common cold viruses.\n",

However, microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible (e.g. do not melt). Microwaves are radio frequency waves, which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field. The intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe that the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect. The initial reports showed microwaves to be an effective microbicide. The microwaves produced by a \u201chome-type\u201d microwave oven (2.45 GHz) completely inactivate bacterial cultures, mycobacteria, viruses, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores within 60 s to 5 min depending on the organism. Another study confirmed these results but also found that higher power microwaves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization. Microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been FDA cleared.",

            "text": "The sterilization phases are:1.Initial vacuum phase air must be removed or purged from the sterilization chamber because mixtures of EtO and air can be explosive. For those items that can withstand very low pressure, a vacuum is drawn on the chamber at a controlled rate. Being that many of the items being sterilized are inside a package, a slow evacuation rate is used when that packaging is not very permeable to the components in air. For those devices, components and packaging that are not designed to withstand deep vacuums and/or high pressures, a different approach to air remove is done. A shallow vacuum with nitrogen gas purge is used. An initial shallow vacuum is drawn followed by a nitrogen injection. The combination of the vacuum and nitrogen injection is called a nitrogen wash. The nitrogen wash is repeated several times to assure an adequate removal of air from the vessel.2.Humidification \u2013 When the initial evacuation phase of the process is performed, the product can lose a significant amount of moisture. Moisture is required for the EtO to sterilize properly. The lost moisture must be replaced prior to introducing the ethylene oxide. This is accomplished by adding humidity in the form of steam injections. The amount of steam required is calculated to yield a predetermined relative humidity. After the addition of steam, the product is allowed to dwell or soak for the amount of time required to replace the moisture lost from the evacuation phase.3.Liquid ethylene oxide is first heated into a gaseous phase and then injected into the chamber. It is often \u201cdiluted\u201d with a carrier gas such as Freon [hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)]. Common dilutions are 8.6% EtO/91.4% HCFC, 10% EtO/90% HCFC, and 8.5% EtO/91.5% CO2. The amount of gas or gas concentration is dependent on two primary factors that are addressed during cycle design but it is usually 450\u20131200 mg/l. The most important factor is to assure that the minimum gas concentration required to achieve sterility within the product is attained. This minimum concentration must be balanced against the second factor, which is the maximum amount of gas that can be injected before difficulties arise due to high levels of poststerilization EtO residuals (EtO remaining in the items being sterilized). Additionally, the chamber is kept at a temperature of 37\u201363 \u00b0C and the relative humidity is 40\u201380%. Exposure time to EtO gas is typically 1\u20136 h.\n",

This is often done by aeration at elevated temperature. Depending on the substrate materials can take 8\u201312 h or more.

Hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mg/l. The hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber for about 50 min and exposes all surfaces and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms. At the completion of the diffusion phase, the chamber pressure is reduced to 0.5 torr. An electrical field created by an RF is applied to the chamber to create a gas plasma, which lasts for 15 min. Microbicidal free radicals are generated in the plasma. The excess gas is removed and in the final stage of the process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high-efficiency filtered air. The vapor purged from the chamber is vented to the atmosphere through a catalytic filter to decompose all remaining traces of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen vapor. The by-products of the cycle (e.g. water vapor, oxygen) are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration.

Irradiation of mail is an effort to disinfect it. The most notable instance of mail irradiation occurred in response to the 2001 anthrax attacks; the level of radiation chosen to kill anthrax spores was so high that it often changed the physical appearance of the mail. A facility in Bridgeport, NJ, operated by Sterigenics International, uses a Rhodotron continuous wave electron beam accelerator built by IBA Industrial to irradiate the mail. A few facilities were planning to use Cobalt-60 sources, though it is unclear whether this was ever done. During irradiation, an intense stream of electrons (or X-rays if X-ray technology is used) strikes the mail and any anthrax spores it may contain. The radiation dose is very high, about 56 kGy of radiation, which is approximately 2 million times more than a chest X-ray.\n",
