In this study, to monitor rapidly and simply oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm viruses possessing H275Y, a duplex one-step RT-PCR assay (H275Y RT-PCR assay) was developed based on an endpoint genotyping analysis method. H275Y RT-PCR assay evaluated using several subtypes/types of influenza A and B viruses and other respiratory pathogenic viruses and shown to have high sensitivity and high specificity. Forty-four clinical specimens were tested after RNA purification using the H275Y RT-PCR assay, resulting in one clinical specimen being found to contain a virus possessing the H275Y mutation. Seventy-three clinical isolates were then tested with the H275Y assay by using clinical isolates in the cultured supernatants of cells directly, without RNA purification, and the results were consistent with the NA sequencing. Since the H275Y RT-PCR assay could detect the H275Y mutation in clinical isolates without RNA purification, as well as a H275Y mutated virus in clinical specimens after RNA purification, the assay was considered a powerful tool for surveillance screening of oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm virus activity.",

This assay could discriminate an oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm virus possessing the H275Y mutation in clinical specimens. RNA purification is required for using the assay to detect the H275Y mutation in clinical specimens, since specimens from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs may contain some components that inhibit the RT-PCR reaction. The assay also could detect the H275Y mutation of the clinical isolates in cultured supernatants directly without RNA purification. Since the RNA purification procedure for each sample increased the risk of cross-contamination and was time-consuming, the ability to perform the assay without RNA purification is advantageous in situations where a large number of clinical isolates are handled.

Of 44 clinical specimens tested, 39 were positive for Type A and H1pdm (Table III and Fig. 2) . Among 39 specimens, the H275Y RT-PCR assay detected 38 oseltamivir-susceptible viruses with H275 and 1 oseltamivir-resistant virus with Y275. These results corresponded to those of NA sequencing. There was no discrepancy between the H275Y RT-PCR assay and NA sequencing, suggesting that the H275Y RT-PCR assay could discriminate A/H1N1pdm viruses possessing H275 and Y275 in clinical specimens.",

Human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza viruses 2 and 4 were obtained from Sendai Medical Center. Human rhinoviruses 1B, 2, 14, 36, and 89 were obtained from Nagasaki Prefectural Institute for Environmental Research and Public Health. Respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, and human coronaviruses were stored in the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).",
