But today, urban planning is instead committed to the opposite tack of trying to unify these separated spheres by bringing people together in meaningful ways (Gillette, 2010). Despite a general trend of decreasing built-up densities in the world today (UN-Habitat, 2016, p. 129), a relentless drive toward compaction and densification is creating new spatial proximities between people pursuing different lives, vocations, and activities in cities.",

If so, how then does one begin to frame propinquity through ethics?

But propinquity can also be defined in terms of , which is the likelihood of coming into contact with another person (Reis, 2007). Cities excel in simultaneously reducing both physical and functional distances. In terms of the former, compaction, densification, and mixed-use urban design\n, all facilitated by the different modes of urban mobility available today (e.g., bike-sharing), have greatly reduced physical distances between people in the city. And in terms of the latter, people are already meeting in urban places\u2014for instance, the marketplace (or the commercial belt), the coffee shop, or the recreation park and playground\u2014in the course of their everyday life, where functional distances are naturally diminished.",

First and foremost, relational propinquity suggests close relations\u2014family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, who may claim a special priority in our relationships. Clearly, relational propinquity is neither dependent on spatial propinquity, nor on situational propinquity, even though certain classes of relational propinquity\u2014especially between nearby neighbors, or colleagues who are collaborating on a shared idea\u2014may emerge after a while because of persistent spatial propinquity. In the context of the city, the relational propinquity of closely knitted neighbors deserves special attention, only if because the formation of these neighborly relations is likely facilitated at least in part by the design of the built environment, which can moderate spatial propinquity. Change this design slightly, and these neighbors might either encounter each other differently, or may never get to meet at all.",

While close physical distance describes the state of spatial proximity, it can also be an outcome of relational propinquity. This possible correlation between spatial and relational propinquity however does not yield to any predetermined order of priority: that is, does spatial propinquity lead to relational propinquity, or is it the other way? In all likelihood, the relationship between spatial propinquity and relational propinquity is likely to be bidirectional in cities. Nevertheless, and independently on its own, spatial propinquity says nothing substantive of any form of relational propinquity. For example, the person who lives in the adjacent apartment is typically called a\nneighbor. But neighborliness, which is a robust sign of relational propinquity, does not necessarily follow from being just neighbors\u2014even though spatial propinquity, as discussed earlier, is surely an important factor for establishing relational propinquity in this example.",

The design of the built environment has been observed to play a pivotal role in modifying the quality of functional distance between neighbors, which in turn could impact the formation of social groups and their social capital (Halpern, 2005, pp. 264\u2013265). In an early comparative study between two student accommodations\u2014one characterized by a double-loaded corridor-type with bedrooms on either side, while the other was a suite-style design with bedrooms organized into a cluster of three sharing a common lounge and bathroom\u2014students from the corridor-type of accommodation were found to be exposed to many social encounters that were unpredictable, uncontrollable, and unwanted (Baum & Valins, 1977, p. 28). In contrast, students from the suite-style accommodation experienced interactions that were controlled, which facilitated the development of more comfortable and effective encounters that in turn built social capital.",

At times, this spatial propinquity is unstructured\u2014for instance, when one is amidst the closeness of packed bodies on an extremely crowded commuter train during peak hours. But when structured, such spatial propinquity regularizes encounters that also engender certain people as neighbors while marking others out as strangers, and where the preconditions of a better or worse neighborly relation are established. This is not to overstate the role of the physical environment in determining behavior. Instead, this is about how the physical environment can come to play a fairly significant role in affecting behavior (Schrijver, 2015), and specifically in this case, how it is also able to demarcate a neighbor from strangers through spatial propinquity. Returning to the study by Baum and Valins (1977) again, it is likely that in the corridor-type student accommodation, neighbors were not so easily distinguishable from strangers. But in contrast, the suite-style type of student accommodation ensured that only a close group of roommates would get to encounter each other in the common areas, and this arrangement made neighbors more distinguishable from strangers. The differences then impacted how neighborly relations were formed\u2014or not\u2014in these two different spatial environments.",

In this sense, situational propinquity is simultaneously the manifestation, and also the outcome of reduced functional distances within the city. Especially effective as a way of explaining the unexpected propinquity that occurs during urban events against a presumably more predictable form of propinquity structured by urban space configurations, the situational dimension of propinquity comes close to the serendipitous, which will be further elucidated in Chapter 10.1007/978-981-13-0308-1_5.",

            "text": "In understanding urban propinquity in this threefold way, it is possible to further derive how these different forms of urban propinquity can interact to produce new propinquities. For example, Reis (2007) suggests that physical proximity tends to increase the frequency of encounters, which can create further opportunities for the likelihood of interaction. In other words, spatial propinquity can further foster possibilities for relational propinquity\u2014for instance, when neighbors interact regularly, which can lead to neighborly relations between them. Conversely, situational propinquity\u2014for instance, in the chanced meeting of a prospective roommate during a social event\u2014can also lead to spatial or relational propinquity. These possibilities demonstrate that not only does propinquity matter, but that it also presents special opportunities and pressures for new encounters and interactions (Painter, 2012). In turn, these form the openings to new ethical relationships in the city. After all, philosopher Emmanuel Levinas (1906\u20131995) suggests that it is the encounter with the Other as neighbor that gives rise to the possibility of ethics (Painter, 2012, p. 528).",

In other words, the closer an individual is to another person in space, the more likely this individual will be attracted to that person. But this proximity effect applies in the reverse as well: The closer an individual is to another person, it is just as likely for dislike to intensify with proximity (Reis, 2007). Beyond the\nproximity effect and according to Glaeser (2011, pp. 34\u201335), spatial propinquity in the form of face-to-face encounter and interaction can also lead to more trust, generosity, and cooperation on one hand, but on the other hand, they can also spur competition. While Glaeser (2011, p. 35) prefers to focus on the productivity gains from the competition that arises because of propinquity, however the agglomeration of heterogeneous people can also lead to what Foster and Iaione (2016, p. 312) call, \u201cthe strain of proximity\u201d\u2014when propinquity results in rivalry and conflict. Indeed, the sentiments of fear and antagonism, which are also surfaced by the encounter of difference and otherness in spatial propinquity, ought to be anticipated as well (see Sandercock, 2003, p. 109).",

Despite having lived in one of the most cosmopolitan and energetic cities in the world today, Bell\u2019s passing went unnoticed and was furthermore dissociated from the social gaze of the city. What could have led the late Mr. Bell to live and then die alone like this\u2014bereft of the very social and emotional resources that are associated with the city? Tonkiss\u2019s (2003) account, together with the poignant realities of loneliness in the city, reveal that while urban propinquity can invite new possibilities for human association, it can also drive an individual away toward anonymity and dissociation. Was the late Mr. Bell driven into isolation because of the overwhelming and constant nature of propinquity in the city? As much as urban propinquity has been associated with the conviviality of human closeness, this same urban propinquity can also pave the way toward desperate isolation and silent suffering in the city.",

In other words, what ought to be the urban ethics regulating respectful intrusiveness, if any? One possible response may align with what Tonkiss (2003) has referred to as the \u201c ethics of indifference,\u201d which suggests a toleration of an indifference to matters of identity and human relatability, and also normalizes a civilized dissociation from other people in the city. While this ethics offers \u201cthe margin\u201d (Tonkiss, 2005, p. 28), where people can find the room to wait, observe, and then decide on how to respond to strangers and their predicaments in the city, however this ethics may be insufficient if people want to anticipate the needs of the unfamiliar others. If the ethics of indifference excels in defining the right to be left alone in a city of other nearby strangers, then at the same time, this ethics has to deny that immediate empathy that can detect and address the acute needs of these unfamiliar others. This room, or the \u201cmargin\u201d of waiting, observing, and exhibiting \u201cwariness\u201d (Painter, 2012, p. 524) toward the stranger may just be the very lapse that could precipitate an irreversible alienation or introversion on the part of this stranger.",

The case of Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong SAR, which is an apartment complex with 17,000 inhabitants, documented how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was transmitted within a dense built environment via air shafts, plumbing systems, floor drains, and the multi-zone airflow between apartments in the complex (Wolf, 2016, p. 964). According to Wolf (2016, p. 964), the \u201cbuilding itself\u201d appears to have facilitated the spread of the virus, which caused forty-two deaths and infected 321 people. Disease transmission during epidemics usually occurs across very short distances of about three feet or less (McKinney, Gong, & Lewis, 2006, p. 28). But in this case, a confluence of physical environmental factors\u2014toilet flushing in closely packed apartment blocks, exhaust fans, and ventilation shafts\u2014all propelled aerosolized viral-laden droplets several hundreds of feet through air to cause human infection (McKinney et al., 2006). Inexorably, the case of the Amoy Gardens has not only prompted new considerations in the design of dense built environment in view of highly contagious diseases, but has also irreversibly transformed the etiquettes and lives in spatial propinquity especially in dense cities.",

In turn, this distinction\u2014at least by \u201cthe ethics of proximity\u201d (Nortvedt & Nordhaug, 2008)\u2014can lead to the preferential or partial treatment of neighbors at the expense of strangers, which may be less than morally justifiable. These moral pitfalls of propinquity are especially critical in what Berry (2014, p. 14) refers to as the \u201cmoral basis of urbanity,\u201d which is concerned with forging a sense of shared purposes and common identity, beyond shared interests, that can permit diverse people to flourish together in a city. In a milieu marked by an unprecedented urban fragmentation and the corresponding need to generate collaboration among strangers in the city (Ignatieff, 2017, p. 51), the moral pitfalls, as well as the ethical prospect of propinquity, can no longer be ignored. Because propinquity can change human relationships by designating certain people as neighbors while marking others as strangers, and because there is a tendency to treat neighbors differently relative to the strangers, the ethical implications of propinquity are anticipated to be relevant in every culturally diverse city today.",

One version of this ethics, which also has been reformulated as a debate here, revolves around an \u201cimpartialist\u201d argument on why we ought not to treat neighbors and strangers differently, and conversely, a \u201cpartialist\u201d argument on articulating why we might tend to treat either the neighbor or the stranger differently (see Reader, 2003). Each side of this debate has important implications for the city and will be examined in greater detail later. And integral to this debate are the following three assumptions. Firstly, that physical distance has an effect on moral distance, defined as, \u201cthe emotional closeness\u2026between agent and beneficiary\u201d (Abelson, 2005, p. 35). Secondly, neighbors are defined as people who live nearby, and strangers are defined as people relatively farther away in terms of both spatial and relational propinquity. And finally, the respective status of neighbors and strangers is assumed to be stable and invariant. These are important starting points for the ethics of proximity. But as later arguments suggest, the urban condition confounds these assumptions. In turn, this demands a modified ethics of proximity that subsequent discussions will attempt to describe.",

Along this line of thinking, propinquity has been taken as the basis for preferential treatment of certain others close to us, against an oppositional line of thinking that suggests we ought to treat everyone fairly and impartially. This polarizing debate on the ethics of proximity has profound implications for the city. For example, cosmopolitan cities today have a special onus to attract, and then bring together, strangers (Yeo, Ho, & Heng, 2016). But despite aspirations for cosmopolitanism, people have been observed to live with strangers only by living apart from them (Ignatieff, 2017, p. 43). Instead, people who share common origins or cultures tend to cluster together with the implication that only people who belong in our in-group deserve the preferential treatment reserved for neighbors. On this, evidence suggests that not only are we morally motivated to help those who are nearby because of the way evolutionary forces have shaped our moral psychology (Greene, 2014), but also that this moral motivation can be diluted, if not utterly \u201cdeadened,\u201d by geographical distances (Glover, 2012, p. 254).",

Singer (1972, p. 231) argues that the same principle that obliges us to save a drowning child nearby is the same as saving a starving stranger far away; proximity, or distance, should have no compelling moral force on our actions. While Singer concedes that physical proximity does make it more likely for us to assist someone who needs help, this proximity is irrelevant, morally speaking, for motivating us to help a nearby person over another who is further away. In other words, the moral force of addressing an obligating need is independent of physical distance (Reader, 2003, p. 367).",

To cultivate a sufficiently strong neighborly relation that one can call on during a time of need, one also has \u201cto store meat in the belly of one\u2019s neighbor,\u201d which is a way of investing in the future (Bresnihan, 2016, p. 102). Investing in the future this way then means cultivating a sufficiently robust neighborly relation with the more proximate neighbor, who gets to claim a partial treatment if only because he is also that nearby source of help during a time of need. Spatial proximity, it appears, has its practical advantages. These advantages, in turn, translate into the likelihood of partial treatment.\n",

And in parallel from moral philosophy, the intersubjective relation, or the \u201cI-You\u201d relation according to Scruton (2017, p. 51), has been deemed as the essential kernel in every aspect of the moral life. This \u201cI-You\u201d relation is strengthened and made more vivid through the exercise of empathy based on what L\u00f8gstrup (2007, p. 145) refers to as the imaginative \u201cchanging of roles,\u201d which is surely facilitated by a closer\u2014rather than a farther\u2014 distance between people. In other words, spatial propinquity in the form of a direct face-to-face encounter activates empathy and also our moral faculties in ways that farther distance can only undermine. In converging these two parallel insights from moral psychology and moral philosophy, they constitute a strong reason for why people tend to tune into the needs of those nearer rather than those farther away.",

In other words, these individuals have a claim on us that others do not have, and that this claim is already a reason to help them in their hour of need (Scruton, 2017). Furthermore, privileging differential treatment to those on the basis of these special relationships does not need to compete with one\u2019s egalitarian outlook; or conversely, to concede to certain obligations toward the stranger is not to demand that they share the \u201csame grip\u201d as the obligations toward our nearest and dearest (Appiah, 2006, p. 158). Loving one\u2019s child, for example, does not necessarily entail a neglect to donate to Oxfam or to displace one\u2019s duty to volunteer at the refugees\u2019 help center. On this, there is no need to assume that partial obligations would come to threaten impartial ones (Reader, 2003, p. 370). Based on these reasons, there is support to slant the ethics of proximity toward favoring more proximate people rather than more distant ones\u2014if only because the differential treatment of those nearest (and dear) to us does not compete in any real sense with many cosmopolitan notions of obligation toward the needy stranger.",

This reality is grounded in the way our moral psychology has been evolved to grant differential treatment to those nearby\u2014and those nearby in evolutionary history have tended to comprise of people who were kin, or who were the most likely sources of help during a time of need. Even so, this reality neither explains why people are sometimes motivated to help nearby strangers (Greene, 2014), nor why certain individuals are motivated to help complete strangers beyond the point of either undermining or obliterating themselves (MacFarquhar, 2016). These counter-realities then suggest that Singer\u2019s argument has traction and remains current\u2014and has yet to be overwhelmed by the sheer force of evidence from moral psychology.

This reality ought to behoove Kant\u2019s (2006, p. 82) notion of a cosmopolitan right to universal hospitality, which states that because all human beings have the right of common possession of the surface of the Earth, but because they cannot scatter themselves on the surface of this sphere without limit, they must \u201cultimately tolerate one another as neighbors.\u201d While this notion has lost none of its moral grip, it has long been disabused by the border fences of nation-states and the different brands of anti-immigration politics. And even if certain barriers have been lowered, and early institutions for some inclusion and integration attempted, these strangers nonetheless occupy an ambiguous territory\u2014quite often and literally, in some form of terrain vague\u2014between the status of the distant stranger and the next-door neighbor whenever they settle in cities. The torturous realities of African migrants stuck in the state of limbo along the various edges of the European Union, or the Chinese migrant workers who live amidst an existential precarity where their life-worlds could be all too swiftly bulldozed, all point to how urban complexities can come to unsettle the established distinction between neighbors and strangers.",

Specifically, Imamichi asks us to consider an intriguing prospect: a neighbor is a relation that can be established, or revoked, by our technological actions. In other words, it is through the impacts of our actions that we make neighbors out of strangers. According to Imamichi (2009), human actions, when amplified by technology, can now impact or even harm people, who are remote from us. Consider, for instance, the alarming damage incurred through the circulation of\nfake news\u2014and how these\nfake news could be generated in one location, but swiftly transmitted by concatenation through any social media platform. Or conversely, where empathy and solidarity with the downtrodden could be shared across national and cultural boundaries through the social media.

What form can this modified ethics of proximity take? Whichever form this modified ethics of proximity takes, it has to conserve the critical role of propinquity in the ethical encounter, and furthermore, to take into account a more unsettled definition of the neighbor and the stranger in the city. To abolish the dyad of the neighbor and the stranger entirely by converging on the Archimedean point of a shared humanity is neither proper nor applicable for the city; this dyad always exists in some form. Instead, it is more probable that a modified ethics of proximity could be found by abandoning certain entrenched notion of the neighbor made obsolete by the city, and simultaneously, in finding a way to address a notion of the stranger that is more aligned to reality in cities today.",

This story appears to respond, though unevenly, to at least three realities in the city that could confound the ethics of the proximity. Firstly, this story does not presume a stable, or invariant, configuration of the neighbor and the stranger. As a matter of fact, certain interpretations of this story have argued that unsettling the conventional notion of the neighbor was part of the objective of this story (Painter, 2012). Secondly, this presumably hypothetical story, nevertheless unfolds in the depiction of an actual place and event, with their clear and concrete moral demands. Unlike the more abstract philosophy that entails an unbounded obligation to help, the Good Samaritan could only do as much as it was within the practical means of his resources. And finally, the open-endedness of the story does resemble the open-endedness of many ethical encounters between strangers in the city. While the Good Samaritan did hint at the possibility that he would return to check on his charge, no one really knows what happened after he left. On this, the story suggests the counter-intuitive possibility of non-reciprocation when rendering significant help, which is important for any ethics of proximity in the city that takes its beneficiaries as those whom one may most likely not meet again.",

The exact intention behind asking this question is unclear. Perhaps this expert was hoping to contradict Jesus: that if everyone could qualify as his neighbor, then no one truly is, and it would become impossible to know any one properly, and much less to love any one of them as himself. Or perhaps this expert was honestly curious on who might this neighbor be, only if because it is often easier to indulge, rather than to love, oneself. Who then, he might have wondered, is deserving of such a morally lofty treatment that would exceed how he is likely to treat himself?",

Perhaps in anticipating but also abolishing the expert\u2019s moral assumptions, Jesus accounted how a priest, whom one might expect to render help, passed by without offering any. Then next came a Levite, who was an esteemed person by Jewish tradition consecrated for religious service, also passed by without offering any help. Finally, a Samaritan came along\u2014a person who was dually unlikely to help. Not only was the Samaritan a member of a social caste that this expert could count on least to offer any help, but the Samaritan was also an individual who had most likely suffered contempt from the social caste of this wounded traveler. Despite these social and anthropological expectations, the Samaritan had compassion on the wounded traveler and he helped. The Samaritan rendered first-aid to the wounded traveler immediately, and then he brought this individual on his transport to an inn, where he further took care of him overnight and on the next day, paid the inn-keeper in advance for more needed care. After accounting this story, Jesus then rebounded the original question to the expert: who then, was the neighbor, to that hapless traveler? The expert of the law then answered: the one who had compassion on him.",

Instead, and based on the story, this person could even be the furthest individual one could expect as a neighbor. Radically, this neighbor can be anyone who needs our help, or who heeds our call for help. The neighbor is defined more by moral propinquity rather than by spatial propinquity. But more to the point and in relation to the city, this story illustrates how an encounter between two strangers could be transformed into a meeting of new neighbors. The pivot of this transformation is compassion, or neighborliness, which defined the Good Samaritan as the neighbor to the hapless traveler. If neighborliness is that transformative moral quality that can bring strangers together in cities today, then what may be the wellspring of this neighborliness?",

While this \u201c Golden Rule\u201d appears to operate on the principle of reciprocation, but in reality, it is in fact predicated on a more imaginative and radical ethic: that one would still help the other person even when this person has done nothing for oneself. In the words of L\u00f8gstrup (2007, p. 143), this ethic appeals to our moral imagination: \u201cThe charitable acts I might have wished another would do for me, had I been in his position, those acts should I do for him.\u201d",

According to L\u00f8gstrup (2007, p. 143), not only does the \u201c Golden Rule\u201d recognize those who need our help are quite often the people who are not able to give anything back in return, they are also likely people who may never be able to do so. In contrast, the principle of reciprocation is based on the idea that since one has been helped, one must then return the favor; it is an obligation, not an act of imaginative compassion. The principle of reciprocation demonstrates how honoring fairness can often overshadow compassion, or neighborliness. Furthermore, how could one know where, or to whom, to return this favor, unless one is also already in spatial or relational propinquity with the person who first offered help? In this way, the principle of reciprocation has to assume a likely neighborly status that already exists in some form, while the \u201c Golden Rule\u201d does not. Unwittingly, L\u00f8gstrup\u2019s version of the \u201c Golden Rule\u201d then may at least stand as a partial answer to a more robust ethic of proximity that can correspond to the complex realities of neighbors and strangers in the city.",
