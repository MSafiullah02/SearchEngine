Especially promising vectors are highly attenuated poxviruses, including modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [1]. MVA has been attenuated by repeated passaging in chicken fibroblast cultures [2], and its properties as potential human vector vaccine have been well characterized [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Various MVA recombinants that express different viral heterologous antigens have been generated and extensively tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials as candidate vaccine against diseases such as AIDS, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [7], [9], [10], [11]. The use of MVA as a vector-based vaccine, however, is predicted to require highly concentrated doses of about 108 infectious units (IU) per mL [1], [6], preferably produced in media free of animal-derived components.",

            "text": "MVA (similar to other viruses such as influenza A virus or yellow fever virus) is being produced in material obtained from embryonated chicken eggs or primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) [8]. However, the use of primary animal-derived material that is continuously fed into vaccine production processes is not an optimal scenario. To overcome this problem, two fully permissive avian suspension cell lines, AGE1.CR (in the following CR) and AGE1.CR.pIX (in the following CR.pIX) were developed [12] and adapted to proliferation in a chemically defined medium to enable the establishment of robust high-yield production processes [13], [14], [15]. Because MVA spreads preferably via cell-to-cell contact a culture format was developed where cell agglomerates of infected and non-infected cells are being induced for production of vaccine preparations. A MVA strain (MVA-CR19) was recently obtained with this system that propagates also in non-agglomerated CR.pIX suspension cells [16]. With this new isolate that represents a different genotype of MVA, titers in the order of 108 IU/mL can be obtained at conventional-cell-densities (CCD) of about 2.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. As a higher fraction of MVA-CR19 is released into the supernatant, harvest of infectious units does not require whole-cell lysates anymore, facilitating the subsequent downstream processing [16].",

While virus propagation in HCD often results either in a decrease in cell-specific yields [18], [19] \u2013 the so-called \u201ccell-density effect\u201d [20], [21] \u2013 or in low volumetric productivity [22], there are reports on positive effects on virus titers and cell-specific yields if certain medium feeding/exchange strategies prior to or during virus propagation are being applied. The described strategies can involve medium recirculation, medium perfusion, and periodic virus harvesting [17]. However, in most of these approaches adherent cell lines were used with limited options for scale-up and process intensification.

Overall, a cell-specific yield of 38 virions/cell was obtained (Table 1, HB19) which was 70% lower than for the reference infections at CCD in shake flasks (Table 1, CS19b), and other reported values (Table 1, CS19a, CSwt). Interestingly, in this HCD cultivation, the concentration of viable cells increased significantly after infection (Fig. 2A). In addition, the percentage of infected cells was very low during the first 36 hpi (Fig. 2C). This suggests a delay in the virus uptake and onset of intracellular virus replication. Given the total amount of medium employed for biomass expansion and during virus propagation, the volumetric productivity was also lower compared to the CCD experiments (Table 1, HB19). Taken together, two key factors seemed to be important for further improvement of HCD cultivations:a.An optimization of infection conditions to achieve fast virus replication after the addition of the seed virusb.A minimization of medium utilization over the entire virus propagation phase without compromising final virus titers\n",

Without medium exchange at TOI, a maximum virus titer of 1.0 \u00d7 108 virions/mL was obtained at 35 hpi (Fig. 4\nB), despite the subsequent addition of a 10-fold glucose-concentrated CD-U3 medium (0, 22 and 50 hpi) in fed-batch (FB) to avoid energy depletion. This led to a very low cell-specific yield of 2.3 virions/cell and a volumetric productivity of 2.4 \u00d7 108 virions/(L d) (Table 2\n), which was about one log lower compared to the HCD cultivation in the bioreactor (Table 1). Compared to infections at CCD, the difference was even larger (Table 1). However, MVA-CR19 production considerably improved with a single 50% medium exchange at TOI followed by the addition of concentrated medium only at 21 hpi, when glucose was depleted. Despite a short-term glucose limitation, no negative effect in later virus propagation was observed and maximum virus titers of 3.2 \u00d7 109 virions/mL were obtained at about 72 hpi in both the lysate and the supernatant (Fig. 4D). This demonstrated that 100% of the produced viruses can be harvested from supernatant at 72 hpi with no need of a cell-disrupting operation (e.g. freeze/thaw), as observed previously in CCD infections. With a cell-specific yield of 62 virions/cell and a volumetric productivity of 6.0 \u00d7 1010 virions/(L d) (Table 2), the results achieved are in the same range as for the HCD perfusion culture performed in the bioreactor (Table 1). This suggested that the medium exchange at TOI rather than the exclusive glucose supply in FB with concentrated medium is required to boost MVA-CR19 virus propagation (especially from 0 to 24 hpi, Fig. 4B and D). Also, it has been reported that glutamine plays a minor role in energy supply for CR.pIX cells and that its absence might not influence the propagation of MVA in this cell line [29]. Therefore, the positive effect of a medium exchange at TOI on virus propagation might be also due to the dilution of inhibitory metabolites or signaling molecules rather than just a better supply of substrates.",

[33], was carried out. A medium volume equal to the working volume at TOI (i.e. 20 mL) was added at time points 12, 24, 36 and 72 hpi (Fig. 5\nD). At 36 hpi, a working volume of 80 mL was reached (which is above the maximum working volume in the 125 mL shake flasks) and the cell suspension was transferred to a 250 mL shake flask to continue the experiment.II.Daily medium exchange (DME): 90% of the culture supernatant was exchanged every 24 h. This was achieved by centrifugation of the complete volume of the shake flask at 200g, 10 min, followed by harvest of 90% of the supernatant, and addition of fresh medium. Vw at TOI: 50 mL.III.Combination of fed-batch and daily medium exchange (F+D): medium was added in the fed-batch mode (see I.) at 12 and 24 hpi. 90% of culture supernatant was exchanged at 36, 72 and 96 hpi. As before, the supernatants were collected as product harvest. Vw at TOI: 20 mL.\n",

Similarly glucose limitations were observed at 24 and 72 hpi for the F+D (Fig. 5F) strategy. However, these short-term limitations did not compromise virus propagation: with virus titers higher than 1.0 \u00d7 108 virions/mL within the first 24 hpi (Fig. 5G\u2013I) all experiments performed better than those with a 50% medium exchange (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the increase in volume for FB (Fig. 5D) and F+D (Fig. 5F) during the first 24 hpi did not result in a noticeable reduction of virus titers compared to the DME strategy (Fig. 5E). This positive effect of volume changes on virus titers, despite their expected reduction due to product dilution, was also documented previously for the volume-expanded fed-batch strategy [33]. At 36 hpi, the DME strategy showed a slight decrease in virus accumulation compared to both other strategies. This is possibly due to the removal of infectious particles (harvest of 90% supernatant) and a glucose limitation at 24 hpi. This contrasted with the FB and F+D strategies, where titers above 1.0 \u00d7 109 virions/mL were reached at 36 hpi. Nevertheless, a daily exchange of medium (DME, F+D strategy) extended the virus production phase, and allowed to achieve virus titers up to 1.0 \u00d7 1010 virions/mL at 72 hpi. In contrast, the maximum titer was only 3.7 \u00d7 109 virions/mL for the FB at the same time point (Fig. 5G\u2013I). Product harvests (supernatant) obtained for the DME and F+D strategies showed consistently very similar virus titers to the lysates (except for harvests at 36 hpi in F+D) and even same titers at 72 hpi. Titers in this range were also obtained by Jordan et al. [16]. Accordingly, MVA-CR19 propagation in the CR.pIX cells does not require any disruption steps of the host cells to achieve very high product titers in HCD cultivations.",

Both FB-based strategies are superior to the DME strategy regarding onset of virus release and maximum Yv/cell app. Furthermore, the maximum Yv/cell app of the F+D strategy exceeds the yield of both other approaches by a factor of two or three. Regarding the PV, the difference between the feeding strategies is smaller. As expected, the difference becomes less evident for the overall cell-specific yield (Table 3\n), which takes into account cells produced even after TOI. However, FB-based strategies (FB and F+D) showed up to two times higher maximum cell-specific yields compared to DME (Table 3), which indicates an optimal balance between the maintenance of healthy cells and the progress of virus replication. This observation is also supported by the higher percentage of infected cells obtained for the FB and F+D strategies (Fig. 5G\u2013I). In summary, all strategies led to higher cell-specific yields compared to the typical process at CCD.",

This way, medium utilization until TOI was considered 60% lower for FB and F+D strategies (Vw = 20 mL) compared to the DME (Vw = 50 mL). Accordingly, the F+D strategy provided the best volumetric productivity, since it provided the lowest medium consumption during the cell expansion phase and produced the highest amount of virus particles (Table 3). Overall, the F+D strategy optimally combined a low medium consumption with high yields. Another positive feature of substrate feeding in a fed-batch mode is that no virus is lost at early stages of infection, which helps to reach a higher fraction of infected cells and high titers at about 36 hpi (Fig. 5G\u2013I) without reaching limiting glucose concentrations. At that time point, a first harvest should also be considered to collect a highly concentrated supernatant and to avoid the accumulation by-products with a negative impact on virus replication (compare time course of virus titers in Fig. 5G and I). Furthermore, a transfer of the cell suspension to a new vessel was not required for the F+D strategy, which represents an advantage against the FB and the reported VEF-batch [33] regarding the operation of large bioreactors.",

One process design that takes these observations into account employs a complete medium exchange, followed by fed-batch intervals. Such a strategy is a good option especially for viruses with replication cycles that are longer than the time needed to deplete the available glucose given in the initial medium exchange. Once this first critical stage is overcome, a (semi-) continuous medium exchange could be applied to collect infectious virus material and to avoid the accumulation of toxic by-products.
