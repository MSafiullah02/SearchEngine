IBV infection results in coughing, sneezing and rales, but also causes lesions in the reproductive tract and kidneys (Darbyshire et al., 1979). Because thousands of birds are typically housed under one roof, IBV can affect large numbers within a short time. Rapid diagnosis and determination of immune status of a flock is critical in controlling outbreaks that result in severe economic losses in both egg layer and broiler facilities. With appropriate standards, enzyme immunoassays are accurate indicators of antibody levels to IBV and facilitate the monitoring of immune status in large flocks (Marquardt, 1981, Snyder et al., 1983). Presently, inactivated virus is used as the coating antigen with the commercially available IBV ELISA kits. Whole virus purification requires propagating quantities of virus in eukaryotic systems and whereas the most reliable serodiagnostic reagents require highly purified antigen, purification of IBV with its highly glycosylated spike protein is difficult and expensive.",

Elution with imidizole provides a means for concentrating from the columns protein that can potentially serve as a source of relatively pure diagnostic reagent. The entire nucleocapsid protein of the Gray strain of IBV has been expressed from the pQE8 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as a fusion product with six amino terminal histidines (Zhou et al., 1996). Using western blot assays and RNA binding assays, the nickel column purified fusion product was found to be antigenic and to interact functionally with RNA, respectively (Zhou et al., 1996). In these studies, this recombinant nucleocapsid protein was used to develop both ELISA and the immunoblot assay with potentially broader field application for detection of IBV-specific antibody.",

IBV antisera reacted with the IBV protein in a dose dependent manner irrespective of strain specificity (Fig. 3\n). The O.D. for sera of individual strains were considerably greater than the O.D. of negative sera. Maximum differences between reactions with anti-Mass, Ark or Gray strain sera and normal sera were detected between 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions of antigen (3.12 and 1.56 \u03bcg/well, respectively) where the ratios of all three positive sera to negative serum were greater than five. The background reaction with negative sera fell at the 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions and the reaction with the homologous Gray serum, representing the index curve, began to fall beyond these dilutions. Therefore, the concentration of recombinant antigen used for the following studies was 2.4 \u03bcg/well.",

A relatively high background reaction was detected in negative sera at the 1:5 or 1:40 dilutions but decreased at higher dilutions.

All IBV specific antisera and the nucleocapsid specific monoclonal antibody at the 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions reacted with the recombinant protein at ratios greater than 5.6 fold the negative serum.

The strongly immunogenic and conserved nucleocapsid protein of IBV is preferred for identification of group specific antisera for IBV (Sneed et al., 1989, Williams et al., 1992). The recombinant fusion protein is useful for serodiagnosis of IBV because it is inexpensively expressed in quantities that can be prepared as highly enriched antigen (Zhou et al., 1996). These preparations of the Gray strain nucleocapsid protein were used in western, immunodot blots, and in microwell plate ELISA to detect anti-IBV antibodies in chicken sera. It is also important to note that the 6X his tag used for purification does not prevent the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to the nitrocellulose membrane and ELISA plates, nor does it interfere with binding of other reagents. The conserved nature of nucleocapsid amino acid sequence and the functional integrity maintained by the bacterial fusion protein predicted its usefulness as a group specific antigen.",

The successful application of ELISA for detecting and quantifying antibodies to IBV was first reported by Marquardt (1981). Since then, IBV has been diagnosed by ELISA employing whole virus as the coating antigen. An ELISA differentiating serotype would predictably require conformationally intact spike antigen produced in a eukaryotic system with predictable glycosylation rather than a bacterial system, such as that used here for the nonglycosylated nucleocapsid protein. Monoclonal antibodies used in ELISA type assays are available for limited serotype distinction (Ignjatovic and McWaters, 1991).",

The dot immunoblot assay easily distinguished reactions between positive and negative sera at even 30 ng per sample. The reactions between the fusion nucleocapsid protein and positive sera were highly reproducible and easily interpreted. The anticipated potential for widespread use will be determined with serological evaluations of large numbers of sera. As these results were based on convalescent sera taken from birds infected with experimentally maintained viruses of only four serotypes, the effectiveness of the reagent should be further tested with IBV strains of additional serotypes, with sera of field infected birds and with sera birds at varying times after infection. However, the broader application of this diagnostic strategy will be to develop serological assays using similarly expressed fusion proteins from other virus pathogens.",
