Therefore, we planned to include 120 patients (assuming a dropout rate of 20' to capture sufficient exacerbation events during 1-year follow up). Data were presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile range [IQR]), or counts (proportion), as appropriate. Bacterial density (colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) was logarithmically transformed before analyses. Categorical variables were compared using \u03c72 tests. For continuous variables, two-group comparisons were performed using unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate; one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test were applied for multiple-group comparisons as appropriate. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between independent variables and presence of viruses. The utility of IP-10 in predicting viral infection during BEs was investigated using receiver operating characteristics curve. Results were presented as area under the curve and 95' CI. A P value < .05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (IBM) and Graphpad Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc).",

Patients were requested to contact investigators once BEs occurred; therefore, milder BEs that mirrored upper respiratory tract infections might have been underreported. The scheduled follow-up investigations to determine effects of viral infection on symptom recovery could not be performed because of poor compliance and the lack of validated electronic diary cards. This reflected real-life practice, where patients have been frequently unwilling to record their symptoms using the daily paper diary in China. Because our setting was a single medical center, some of our findings need to be further validated in multicenter studies.",
