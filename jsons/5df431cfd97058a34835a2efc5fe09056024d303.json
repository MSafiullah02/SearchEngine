Secondary objectives included assessment of the impact of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), maternal history of chorioamnionitis, side effects and route of administration associated with hydrocortisone's efficacy. Dexamethasone as second-line treatment to decrease respiratory support was reviewed. Methods Retrospective chart review of preterm infants requiring respiratory support receiving hydrocortisone. Results A total of 48 patients were included. Successful extubation was achieved in 50% of intubated patients after hydrocortisone treatment with no major complications. In our small study, history of maternal chorioamnionitis, IUGR or route of administration did not affect the response. Rescue dexamethasone after hydrocortisone therapy was ineffective in the ten patients who failed extubation following hydrocortisone. Conclusion Hydrocortisone is effective in decreasing respiratory support in patients with developing BPD without major complications. Randomized studies are warranted to confirm our findings.",

            "text": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of prematurity, with a multifactorial pathogenesis including, but not limited to, arrested lung development and persistent inflammation. The definition of BPD has evolved over time most recently defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), with grading of severity based on newer modes of noninvasive ventilation [1] [2] [3] [4] . Because BPD has been associated with presence of low cortisol levels in premature infants and ongoing inflammation due to mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure, treatment options include corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone [5, 6] . However, despite several metaanalyses demonstrating the efficacy of steroid therapy facilitating extubation, concerns surrounding adverse effects, primarily on neurodevelopmental outcome, limited their use [7] [8] [9] . Given BPD has proven to be an independent risk factor for poor neurodevelopment, further studies evaluating lower cumulative doses of dexamethasone, administered later in neonatal life, or alternative steroid therapy have been conducted [10] . The DART study (Dexamethasone: A Randomized Trial) compared a lower initial dose of 0.15 mg/ kg/day, tapered over 10 days for a cumulative exposure of 0.89 mg/kg versus placebo [10] . This lower cumulative dosing regimen proved to have immediate benefits including a shortened duration of intubation for ventilator-dependent infants; however, the study was not powered to detect differences in long-term outcomes. Subsequently, a metaanalysis published in 2008 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine an optimal dosing regimen [11] . This has led to the search for alternative treatment, including steroids which target different receptors, such as hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone binds preferentially to the glucocorticoid receptor, promoting neuronal cell apoptosis. In addition to glucocorticoid receptor binding, hydrocortisone also binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is protective against neuronal cell death [12] [13] [14] . This dual receptor binding of hydrocortisone and therefore its protective role in neuronal apoptosis is the rationale for hydrocortisone use in our unit (Table 1 ) [15, 16] .",

Infection was identified via positive cultures (cerebral spinal fluid, blood, and/or urine) during and up to 1 week following \"Actions of synthetic steroids are similar to those of cortisol (hydrocortisone is synthetic cortisol). They bind to the specific intracellular receptor proteins and produce the same effects but have different ratios of glucocorticoid to mineralocorticoid potency.\" [16] hydrocortisone. In addition, hydrocortisone's efficacy was evaluated to determine if there was a correlation with patient characteristics, such as history of IUGR (based on prenatal ultrasound findings), maternal chorioamnionitis (based on placental pathology diagnosis) or route of administration (intravenous (IV) vs enteral). Patient charts were reviewed for DART protocol administration if hydrocortisone treatment was ineffective and patients remained intubated. Efficacy results for DART were defined as successful extubation by day 10 following treatment and a decrease in the RSS between day 0 and 10. IV hydrocortisone was supplied as hydrocortisone sodium succinate diluted in normal saline. Hydrocortisone 2 mg/mL oral suspension was utilized for patients who received enteral hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone tablets were crushed and compounded in a 1:1 ratio of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus to create a suspension [26] . Due to the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, hydrocortisone was not administered within 24 h of indomethacin administration [27, 28] . Our hospital's Investigational Review Board approved this study. Consent was not required due to the retrospective nature of the study.",

Based on data published by Anchieta et al., this is a normal weight and length growth rate for a premature baby [29] . Lastly, we reviewed head circumference growth and head ultrasound results after hydrocortisone treatment as an indication for potential future neurodevelopmental impairment. For all patients, head circumference increased, as expected [29] , by a median of 1 cm weekly up to 2 months post treatment ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2c ). Head ultrasound results worsened during and soon after hydrocortisone therapy in two patients. One patient presented with findings consistent with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) during treatment, suggestive of complicated birth and perinatal history as a possible cause. The second patient developed grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) during hydrocortisone treatment with progression to PVL one month later. In this case, we cannot exclude any association between hydrocortisone and the head ultrasound findings. Both of these patients did not receive DART therapy during their NICU admission.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that steroid treatment would have helped to Fig. 2 Hydrocortisone efficacy. a Respiratory outcomes in patients who received hydrocortisone. Extubation was observed in 50% of patients (20/40) who were intubated at initiation. FiO 2 decrease of \u226510% at 10 days post hydrocortisone completion was seen in 52.1% (25/48) of patients. The combined outcome of extubation or decreased FiO 2 by 10% was achieved in 66.7% patients (32/48). Extubation rate was based only on the n = 40 subjects who were intubated. b Respiratory severity score (RSS = MAP \u00d7 FiO 2 ) was calculated at day 0 and day 10 of hydrocortisone treatment. A statistically significant decrease was detected using the Wilcoxon signed rank test in RSS between day 0 of the hydrocortisone treatment and day 10 after the initiation (p < 0.0399). Std dev: Standard Deviation. Pctl: Percentile. c Efficacy was not affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) status, maternal history of chorioamnionitis (CAM), route of administration of hydrocortisone, gender, tapering of the dose, gestational age, days of life (DOL) at hydrocortisone initiation, birth weight, postmenstrual age (PMA) at the time of treatment initiation. The primary efficacy outcome was defined as extubation in the 40 patients who were intubated at hydrocortisone initiation or effective weaning to room air in the patients on noninvasive ventilation (n = 8) at hydrocortisone initiation. The univariate logistic regression with efficacy for decreased ventilator support as the outcome was used for these analyses.",
