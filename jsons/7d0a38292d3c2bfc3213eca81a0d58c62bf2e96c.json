            "text": "Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public 19 health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease 20 outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including 21 complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions 22 associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes 23 associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 24 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for 25 complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, 26 and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients -effects 27 that could not be explained by age or sex. In addition, using data from the UK Biobank, we implemented 28 a candidate driven approach to evaluate linkage between severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and genetic 29 variation associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Among our findings, our scan identified 30 an eQTL for CD55 (a negative regulator of complement activation) and SNPs in Complement Factor H 31 (CFH) and Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha (C4BPA), which play central roles in 32 complement activation and innate immunity and were previously linked to Age Related Macular 33 Degeneration (AMD) in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). In addition to providing evidence 34 that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to several putative 35 genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical 36 approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical 37 informatics and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical 38 outcome associated with infection. 39 40 45 fully understood. Further, with some notable exceptions 1-3 , molecular studies have largely focused on 46 ACE-2, the receptor and determinant of cell entry and viral replication 3 . While ACE-2 expression is 47 critical, viruses employ a wide range of molecular strategies to infect cells, avoid detection, and 48 proliferate. In addition, viral replication and immune mediated pathology are the primary drivers of 49 morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection 4,5 . Therefore, understanding how virus-",

As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 , we identified significant 137 risk of mechanical respiration and mortality associated with age and sex, as well as history of 138 hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, we found 139 that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and coagulation 140 disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) were at significantly increased risk of adverse 141 clinical outcomes (including mechanical respiration and death) following SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure   142 1, Table 1 ). Specifically, we observed a mechanical respiration rate of 15.9% (95% CI: 8.3-23.6) and a 143 mortality rate of 25% (95% CI: 16.0-34.0) among patients with a history of macular degeneration, and 144 rates of 9.4% (95% CI: 7.7-11.1) and 14.7% (95% CI: 12.7-16.7) for mechanical respiration and 145 mortality, respectively, among patients with coagulation disorders (Table 1) .

We begin by creating a master list of 358 suspected covid patients. These are patients that are either diagnosed with the disease, as indicated by a 359 ICD10 code for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in their billing data or a patient that was tested for the presence 360 of the virus using RT-PCR as indicated by a \"lab\" order for the test. We found 2,821 using the former 361 method and 11,116 patients using the latter. We then extracted birthdates, death dates (if the patient had 362 died or a null value otherwise), and sex codes (1 for female, 2 for male). Patients which had sex codes for 363 non-binary genders were excluded from our analysis. We then define a \"first diagnosis date\" for each 364 patient as either their first diagnosis date (by billing code) or the first date that they tested positive for 365 SARS-CoV-2, whichever comes first. Next, we calculate each patient's age at the time of this \"first 366 diagnosis date.\" Each of the outcomes and covariates are extracted from their respective tables as detailed 367 in the github. Whenever possible, we use the highest-level ancestor code (from the structured vocabulary 368 in OMOP) that represents the concept we want to model. We then use the concept ancestor tables to grab 369 all the descendant codes. Note that diabetic kidney disease was considered for inclusion and so is 370 represented in the data preparation script, however, it was never modeled. Cough is included as a 371 covariate as a reference symptom for comparison. The last step in the preparation process was to compute 372 the censor dates. To do, we iterated through each patient in our master list and computed their time (in 373 days) to intubation (if they required mechanical respiration) or death (if they died). If not, then the study 374 end date (April 25, 2020) was used as the patient's censored time (in days). Finally, for any patients that ",
