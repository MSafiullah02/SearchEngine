[1] [2] [3] 6 Significant environmental contamination (including washbasin, toilet bowl, and surfaces of the air outlet fan) has been noted in hospitalized patients. [1] [2] [3] Thus, it is prudent to advise transplant and LVAD recipients to ardently practice mitigation strategies such as social distancing, sanitization, hand hygiene, and avoidance of areas known to harbor potentially infected individuals. These recommendations extend to their care providers as well.",

Our LVAD patient, unfortunately, belongs to the most COVID-19-infected and first red-line area in Italy: Piacenza, a city of the Emilia-Romagna region. 1 PET/CT examinations in asymptomatic patients may not be surprising, but this is the first report, to our knowledge, on COVID-19 infection in a LVAD recipient with such kind of a clinical scenario and nuclear medicine imaging casual pattern that has been suggestive of COVID-19 disease. [4] [5] [6] [7] The majority of patients with coronavirus will recover spontaneously, without requiring any medical attention. Patients with mild symptoms can generally be discharged home, with instructions to isolate themselves. [1] [2] [3] 6 These decisions should be made in coordination with local health departments, who can assist in follow-up. 1-3, 6 Shi et al. 4 performed CT scanning in a group of healthcare workers who were exposed to COVID-19 before they became symptomatic. Ground-glass opacification on CT scan was seen in the vast majority of patients. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] This confirms the emergence of CT abnormality before symptoms could be consistent with the existence of an asymptomatic carrier state. 6 Sensitivity of chest x-ray is lower than CT scan for subtle opacities. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Guan et al. 3 showed a chest x-ray sensitivity of 59%, compared with 86% for CT scan. Sensitivity among patients with positive RT-PCR is high. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The exact numbers vary, likely reflecting variability in how scans are interpreted. There currently does not seem to be any precise definition of what constitutes a \"positive\" CT scan. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Ai et al. 5 reported on a CT scan sensitivity of 97%. However, among patients with only constitutional symptoms (but not respiratory symptoms), CT scan may be less sensitive (<50%). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Additionally, in COVID-19 syndrome, at laboratory, white blood cell (WBC) count tends to be normal. 3, 6 Lymphocytopenia is common (seen in about 80% of patients) due to the damages of cytoplasmic component by SARS-CoV viral particles. 3, 6 Mild thrombocytopenia is common, but platelet (PLT) counts are rarely <100 \u00d7 10 9 /L. 3, 6 Lower PLT count is a poor prognostic sign. However, in our LVAD patient, WBCs' count was 6.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, while PLTs' was 185.",

[1] [2] [3] 6 So far, no evidence has been published to suggest that cardiothoracic transplant recipients are at a greater risk of developing severe illness. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Evolution into symptomatic COVID-19 disease may be life threatening; thus, early detection (via any instrument), timing, and radical intensive anti-inflammatory/ respiratory treatment are currently the keys to preserve life. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Additionally, this experience highlights and confirms the diagnostic value of 18 F-FDG PET scan in detecting the localization and extension of infection to internal LVAD components. 8 After PET evaluation, we are going to consider surgery, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), and antibiotic therapy adoption to treat the potential lead tunneling fistula evolution in our reported patient, soon.",
