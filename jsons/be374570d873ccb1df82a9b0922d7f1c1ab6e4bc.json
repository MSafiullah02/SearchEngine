There are many unknowns, and the massive demand for evidence on the treatment of a novel disease like COVID-19 may be unintentionally affecting studies' design and conduct. Furthermore, it may inadvertently affect the peer-review and publication process, leading to significant methodology gaps and overall lower quality evidence on COVID-19. These gaps lead to less informative studies, loss of precious time, and valuable resources. Therefore, current research should balance feasibility and efficiency against methodological rigor and carefully address methodology gaps as much as possible. In order to support universal clinical decision-making and minimize harm, the research community should focus on conducting and publishing trust-worthy evidence. Hypothesis generating studies are welcome and essential but should be explicitly framed as such, acknowledging their limitation, and not be used for critical decisions, at the national or global level.",

            "text": "Based on the quality of the evidence to date, can a clinical practice guideline issue any recommendations on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or combination with other treatments? The case has not been made either way for these quinine derivatives. The body of evidence thus far has been from both in vitro studies (2) (3) (4) and clinical studies (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) of sub-optimal methodological quality. The emerging clinical studies such as case-series, cohort studies, and randomized control trials (RCTs), are all inconclusive; while some may suggest some benefit, the entire body of evidence does not reach the level of certainty and confidence that is required to justify the use of quinine derivatives as a treatment for COVID-19 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . As exciting as some of these results may appear, the underlying research methodologies are often flawed, and as such, the reported results cannot be trusted. A most recent French prospective study (10) on the use of chloroquine in combination with azithromycin completely contradicts a prior French study asserting the benefit of the combination (8, 9) . When critically appraised using the appropriate risk of bias tools, all studies (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) have been classified as high risk of biased estimates of effect (11, 12) (Table 1) . Overall, the methodologies of the published studies are not robust, and the results are tempered by selection bias and residual confounding bias. At the design level, most studies lack the randomization and blinding/masking needed to generate sound evidence, when they are RCTs and not observational uncontrolled single arm case-series. At the analysis level, they lack the standard steps taken to minimize confounding such as prospective design, statistical adjustment for prognostic factors, (propensity) matching, or stratification (13) . The reporting is very sparse, and patient-important outcomes needed for decision-making are often not studied or not reported. We do understand the urgency to identify effective treatments, as well as the barriers to perform rigorous research in health care settings overwhelmed by an unprecedented workload and a novel deadly disease. However, these unprecedented and unfortunate circumstances do not transform flawed data into sound results. The adequately powered, comparative, rigorous effectiveness research that is needed for optimal evidence-informed decision-making remains absent. Researchers need to prioritize minimizing bias by randomizing a large enough number of patients and masking the treatment allocation as much as it is feasible, and fully accounting for all the patients enrolled in the study following the intention-to-treat analysis principle ( Table 2 ). These critical components of high-quality, trustworthy research are required to generate high confidence that the estimates of effect reflect the true effects. At this time, more than ever, the high-quality, robust, comparative evidence from ethical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is urgently needed to assess patient-important outcomes, including mortality, morbidity, need for life support, safety, and toxicity, informing on the safe use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) in people with COVID-19.",

Of course, these studies will need to be fast, and even better, conducted in a flexible framework (such as adaptive trials) able to accommodate the adding of and switching to different treatments as soon the ones under study are proven ineffective or more promising alternatives are suggested. Consideration of master protocols (harmonization of efforts) and adaptive trial designs become very important (16) . The World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated for randomized multi-center adaptive clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of investigational therapeutic agents in combination with standard-of-care for the treatment of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (17) . Researchers aligning their methodology to WHO's master protocol will surely improve quality of the COVID research (16, 17) . Additionally, global research groups conducting clinical trials would help in disseminating their results by adhering to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) checklist for optimal clinical trial reporting (15) and the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) statement that outlines the guidance for optimal reporting of observational studies (14) . This is critically important and especially in this COVID-19 urgency when very serious national and global public health decisions are being made based on what information is shared (or not shared). Evidence exists to show that clinical trial results are biased when the trials utilize inferior methodology or report findings without satisfactory description of the methods used. Failing to conceal allocation of the generated sequence has been linked to an exaggeration of the effectiveness of 30% or greater (15) .",

What if mortality in the two groups, masked as being treatment and control, was posted on a website every 100 patients reaching the outcome (recovered or dead) to transparently show if equipoise persists? What if the dataset at 1000 patients, or every 1000 patients if needed, was made publicly available for highly skilled statisticians to propose their interpretation? We would get 1000 patients every few days, and we would be receiving clinically sound results faster than any traditional study framework.

Potential adverse effects, toxicities, and medication interactions must remain key considerations when using any drug, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, in combination with azithromycin, are no exception. Indeed, the evidence suggests that both drugs prolong the QT interval leading predisposing patients to serious arrhythmias (18) (19) (20) (21) . This is of particular concern when co-administering macrolides (azithromycin) (22) , also known to affect cardiac electrophysiology. Indeed, the use of doxycycline (22) has been proposed in azithromycin's place. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has even warned the public that azithromycin (Zithromax or Zmax) can potentially cause irregular changes in the electrical activity of the heart and could lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm (23) . In this regard, researchers recently looked at 84 COVID-19 infected patients who were administered a hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination (24) . They found that the QTc was prolonged maximally after 3-4 days from the beginning of treatment, and in 25 patients the QTc increased more than 40ms. They also found that in 9 patients (11%), the QTc increased to >500 ms, indicative of a high-risk group for arrhythmia.",
