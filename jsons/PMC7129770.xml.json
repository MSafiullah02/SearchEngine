Our analysis of the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database shows that during the past decade, ECMO support after heart surgery (post-cardiotomy) and for respiratory failure has increased by more than six times.2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 flu epidemics showed the need for lifesaving technologies and the ability of ECMO to potentially address this need in the treatment of ARDS;1 after its successful application in these outbreaks in 2007, rates of ECMO use for respiratory failure rapidly increased.3, 4\n",

Some French, German, and Taiwanese centres have reported the feasibility of use of ECMO for cardiopulmonary arrest by trained interdisciplinary teams.5, 6, 7 The French field ECMO programme was established to specifically deal with the anticipated need for mobile ECMO in an H1N1 epidemic.5 This programme enhanced the possibility of incorporating ECMO into comprehensive emergency preparedness programmes as a medical countermeasure against epidemics or terrorist actions that could lead to ARDS. However, evidence on its use in this type of setting is limited. Although clinical information from case series, trials, and the ELSO registry provide some data, similar to other devices for disaster preparedness regimens, these devices cannot be fully tested until disaster situations arise. Bleeding, embolic, and infectious complications inherent in the use of ECMO might be increased when used in mass casualty settings in inexperienced hands. Indications for the use of ECMO could be inadvertently or erroneously expanded to include healthier patients in view of present enthusiasm for the technology because of its success in treating patients with H1N1 or SARS. Furthermore, ECMO might not be discontinued in futile cases whereby its further use leads to needless prolongation of patient discomfort and an inappropriate use of scare resources. All these factors make regulatory approval and consideration of ECMO as a medical countermeasure challenging; however, approval is needed to allow production and dissemination of sufficient devices for use in a public-health emergency.",

It invites an even more radical change than the innovation pathway used by the US Food and Drug Administration.8 The type and number of patients affected by acts of bioterrorism or public-health emergencies that ECMO could treat is unknown; the device cannot be fully tested until those situations occur. For present approved devices, including ECMO, the approach to their use will be based on present clinical evidence, modelling, and expert opinion. For novel devices that are potential medical countermeasures, different types and thresholds of evidence are needed to accelerate approval. Appropriate systems of assessment need to be developed that can incorporate new concepts for using accumulated data as surrogate evidence of effectiveness (and safety) in medical countermeasure settings to allow ECMOs to be included into strategies of preparedness without delays. The amount and type of evidence will vary depending on whether the device used poses high clinical risks (eg, ECMO) or low clinical risks (eg, a novel type of wound dressing).",

In addition to this framework, the development of new systems for data collection and plans to incorporate new technologies, such as ECMO, is imperative.
