Bats are unique amongst mammals for their ability to fly, and possess notable traits such as long life expectancy in proportion to body size [2]. Many species of bats exhibit exotic traits including echolocation and hibernation, and bats are an important part of the ecosystem via plant pollination and insect control [3]. Notoriously, bats are also reservoir hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses [4]. Understanding the mechanisms by which bats co-exist with and seemingly tolerate viruses that are deadly in humans and other mammals has implications for human health, and may facilitate development of new antiviral strategies.",

MiRNAs are essential regulators of eukaryotic gene expression [5] and include elements required for viral replication [6]. MiRNA biogenesis is a multistep process in which primary-miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNA) are cleaved into precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA) by the nuclear RNase III DROSHA and then further processed in the cytoplasm by DICER1 to produce mature miRNAs averaging 22 nt in length [5]. This process produces transcripts from both arms of the precursor, whereas the loop and flanking sequences are destroyed. This information is exploited by miRNA-finding algorithms such as miRDeep2 for the identification of miRNA-like sequences in small RNA transcriptome data.",

Figure 1 illustrates the analysis pipeline used to identify miRNAs. Approximately 30% of the raw reads were discarded during data filtering, mainly due to absence of the 3\u2019 adapter (15.6%). Data quality was examined before and after trimming and filtering (Additional file 1: Figure S1). MiRNAs were then identified using miRDeep2. As no P. alecto miRNAs were known prior to this undertaking, miRDeep2 was provided with a large set of learning information in the form of all known vertebrate miRNAs from a recent release of miRBase (version 19). This resulted in identification of 426 distinct miRNA precursors, from which 551 different mature and star transcripts were detected (Figure 2, Additional file 2: Table S1). While 361 (85%) of the precursors mapped to a unique locus, the remaining 65 consisted of 31 overlapping pairs plus an overlapping triplet. For 27 of these pairs, the presence of star reads for one member only and/or large differences in miRDeep2 scores indicated the likely precursor (Additional file 3: Table S2). The lower scoring precursor in each of these cases was excluded from further analysis. Six overlapping pairs remained unresolved, either due to an absence of star reads or because mature and star sequences were palindromic, thus the set of P. alecto miRNAs in this dataset consists of 399 candidates.",

P. alecto miRNAs were then compared to the reference data using BLASTN (Figure 3, Additional file 5: Table S4).

This revealed an additional 36 P. alecto mature miRNAs that had hits to miRBase 20 vertebrates with 100% internal identity but one or more over- hanging or under-hanging ends. A further 34 mature P. alecto miRNAs had high-scoring hits to miRBase 20 vertebrates but contained internal mismatches or gaps, while 96 P. alecto mature miRNAs had no reliable hits against miRBase 20 vertebrates at all.

The closest nearby genes, FMR1 and AFF2, are located a distance of 0.5-1.5 Mb from the miRNA cluster. In the human genome, FMR1 and AFF2 are located on the X chromosome, adjacent to two recognised miRNA clusters (miR-888:892 and miR-506:514). One of the three bat miRNAs in this cluster (pal-can-103) returned a non-identical BLAST hit to dog miR-514, while the other two returned only low-quality hits. The second cluster consisted of pal-can-195, pal-can-261 and pal-can-303. One of these (pal-can-303) returned a BLAST hit to miR-506, while the other two returned only low-quality BLAST hits (however these included miR-465, which is also located on the X chromosome in humans and a member of an equivalent miRNA cluster in rodents). Thus the two novel-only clusters appear to represent parts of the same cluster split over multiple scaffolds. Based on homology, nine additional miRNAs were identified that may also belong to this cluster. A proposed arrangement is shown in Figure 4. Overall, 15 bat miRNAs may represent members of a cluster homologous to the human X-chromosomal miR-506:514 cluster.

In two somewhat comparable studies, miRDeep2 was used to identify 399 miRNAs in the pig intestine, including 354 with a miRDeep2 score above \u22123 [23], while in silico analysis of the horse genome identified a total of 406 miRNAs [24].

From these comparisons it can be concluded that the number of miRNAs observed in the bat transcriptome can be considered fairly typical.

In our study, the major factor determining the final number of miRNAs was the miRDeep2 score. As may be expected, lowering the cut-off score involves a trade-off between sensitivity (fewer false negatives) and specificity (more false positives). A cut-off score \u2265 1 provides a typical starting point for miRNA identification; however many highly-conserved miRNAs which are very likely to be real do not meet this stringent cut-off. If the cut-off score is lowered, however, the number of highly improbable candidates rapidly increases. Relying on a single, stringent cut-off point comes at a significant cost of missing many genuine miRNAs. We concluded that within our data, miRDeep2 score and read depth were the factors that best enabled miRNA identification. We chose a model that accepted all hits to known miRNAs (regardless of score), novel hits with scores \u2265 1 and read depth \u2265 2 (typical hits), and novel hits with scores \u2265 \u22125 and read depth \u2265 5 (outliers). Following the initial screening, a further 27 candidates were culled because they overlapped higher-scoring candidates, leaving a total of 399 candidates under consideration. This model, in our opinion, reflected a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than a single parameter cut-off model. In support of our decision, we found that 48 out of the 96 miRNAs that scored less than 1 returned good BLAST hits to known vertebrate miRNAs in miRBase. The remaining 48 could not be specifically identified, but included 8 in clusters and 13 that had BLAST hits to mature miRNAs in other bats.

In the rat, miR-541 is described as a brain-specific miRNA involved in neuron proliferation and neurite outgrowth via suppression of synapsin I [27], while the corresponding star sequence (which is also unique to P. alecto including one difference in the seed region), has been reported to be downregulated in a region of the brain (the spinal dorsal horn) in rats with experimentally-induced neuropathic pain [28]. It is well established that miRNAs play important roles in apoptosis [29\u201331], and one possibility is that viruses such as HeV block apoptosis via induction of host miRNAs that downregulate pro-apoptotic genes. P. alecto miR-541 is a candidate miRNA in such a scenario, however it remains to be experimentally determined as to whether the differences in the sequence of P. alecto miR-541 correspond to differences in function between bats and other mammals, or whether it plays any role in apoptosis.",

Equal amounts of tissue from each organ were pooled from the four bats and processed using the MirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers\u2019 guidelines. Bat small RNA was prepared for Illumina sequencing as follows: ~7 \u03bcg total RNA was size-fractionated by Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and RNA fragments between 20 and 30 bases in length were isolated. The purified small RNAs were ligated with 5\u2019 adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA). To remove un-ligated adapters, ligation products were gel purified on Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel.

After gel purification on Novex 10% TBE-Urea gel, fragments with adapters at both ends (70\u201390 bases in length) were reverse transcribed and subjected to 15 cycles of PCR. Amplification products were loaded on Novex 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen) and the gel band containing 90- to 100-bp fragments was excised.

The option -a indicates the adapter sequence to trim, while -m and -M designate the minimum and maximum length reads to keep after trimming. -O indicates the minimum number of matching bases required to trigger adapter recognition. Trimmed reads were filtered using the FASTX-Toolkit [43]. Fastx_artifacts_filter was run with default settings to remove reads consisting of > 90% homopolymers, followed by fastq_quality_filter with the following options: \u2212q 16 -p 90, meaning at least 90% of bases in a read needed quality scores of at least 16 for the read to be retained). Filtered reads were processed for miRNA content using miRDeep2 [44]. Filtered reads were pre-processed using the mapper.pl module with the following options: \u2212e -j -h -m. The -e option designates FASTQ input data, \u2212j removes sequencing reads with called nucleotides other than A, C, G, T and N, \u2212h converts to FASTA format and -m assigns reads with identical sequence to a single FASTA entry with a header tag designating the combined read count. Pre-processed reads were then analysed for miRNA content using the miRDeep2.pl module with the following options: mature_ref_vertebrates mature_ref_vertebrates none -a 1 -b \u22125.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were identified by RFAM batch search [45]. Homologs were identified using standalone command line BLAST (version 2.2.29) [46]. For comparison, vertebrate mature, star and precursor miRNA sequences were obtained from miRBase (version 20) [47]. The vertebrate reference miRNA set consisted of 38 species, made up of 25 mammals (5 Laurasatherians, 13 primates, 3 rodents, 3 marsupials, 1 monotreme), and 13 non-mammals (10 fish, 2 birds, 1 reptile). Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus predicted miRNA precursor sequences were obtained from Ensembl. Additional datasets were obtained from supplementary materials accompanying published articles by Biggar et al. [9], Platt et al. [13]. For identification of mature and star miRNAs by BLASTN, the following options were used: \u2212strand plus -evalue 10 -word_size 4 -penalty \u22124 -reward 5 -gapopen 8 -gapextend 6. MiRNAs were then categorised as 100% match, mismatch or no hit, relative to their top BLAST hits. Within the 100% match category, miRNAs were allowed to have up to 3 bp over/underhanging at the ends (a maximum of 2 bp was allowed for each individual end), relative to their top BLAST hit. This step that we refer to as \u2018end-anchoring\u2019 was accomplished using the custom BLAST output format and the command-line tool awk, and was deemed necessary to account for minor length variations in mature forms, but to screen out hits in which the alignment is merely truncated due to terminal mismatches. For identification of precursor miRNAs, the same parameters were used, except the minimum e_value was set to 0.001 and hits were filtered for > 80% identity and > 80% overlap using awk. Top hits were identified by e-value from the BLAST output using in-house python scripts. If multiple high-scoring hits were present, hits were further ranked by species in the following order (human, horse, cow, pig, dog, sheep, mouse, rat, macaque, gorilla, other) to facilitate downstream annotation analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MEGA (version 5) [48]. Putative miRNA targets were identified using miRanda [49] with the following options: \u2212en \u221220 -strict. The -en option defines the minimum free energy threshold for a miRNA-target pairing, while the -strict option demands perfect complementarity between the miRNA seed region and the target. A database for miR:Target prediction was constructed as follows: Using P. alecto transcriptome data assembled against the reference P. alecto genome [19], 3\u2019 UTRs were extracted using a python script. Sequences were filtered to exclude those that exceeded 2500 nt in length as they may not reflect genuine mRNAs, while others lacking gene IDs were excluded on the basis that they were unsuitable for annotation enrichment analysis. Functional annotation clustering analyses (GO and KEGG) were performed using the DAVID web service [50] accessed via python scripts. Due to the large number of hits for GO enrichment, an additional filter of FDR < 1.0 was applied.",
