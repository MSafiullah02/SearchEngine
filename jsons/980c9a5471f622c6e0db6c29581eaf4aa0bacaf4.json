In a previous report of a case with pneumonia and severe respiratory distress, fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline mem-brane formation were the main histopathologic findings. 2 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 is possible 3 and the pathologic findings in the lungs mentioned by Tian et al. 1 To the Editor: Thank you for forwarding the letter by Joob and Wiwanitkit 1 regarding our recent paper \"Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer.\" 2 We thank Dr. Joob and Dr. Wiwanitkit for their interest in our work and appreciate their comments.",

Afterward, both patients were confirmed to have developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Retrospective reviews revealed radiographic changes in the patients' lungs around the time of the operation. Both patients had a history of exposure to the virus. Although the patients did not exhibit symptoms at the time of the operation, subsequent pathologic examination revealed changes as reported in the paper; 2 thus, this represents the early changes seen in COVID-19 pneumonia. As we know, many diseases can have radiographic or pathologic changes before clinical symptoms develop.",

Post operation on day 1, patient 1 had increased white blood cell count and lymphocytopenia, which are not consistent with the usual nonspecific postoperative responses. Instead, they are consistent with what has been described in many patients with COVID-19. Patient 2 exhibited evident ground-glass opacity in the lungs as early as on day 2 post operation. These are signs of early COVID-19 pneumonia, given the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms and more typical radiographic changes, as well as positive nucleic acid tests.",

Changes there represent a late, advanced stage of COVID-19 pneumonia. We know that diseases evolve and progress in a subpopulation of patients. For most fatal acute infectious diseases, pathologic studies are on autopsies, which only reveal the most advanced stage of the disease. Even though the two patients referred to in our paper eventually progressed to severe pneumonia (one died), our findings in their lobectomy specimens represent the early, presymptomatic stage of the disease. For these reasons, what we have reported 2 is particularly valuable in helping us understand the evolution of the disease better and is not just a simple \"snapshot\" of the disease. In other words, it is more important to learn about the dynamic \"live\" pathology than \"dead\" pathology.",
