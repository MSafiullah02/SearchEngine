Our results extend the cross\u2010sectional findings by Harju et al. (13) who observed no significant differences in the presence of four respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, enterovirus, RSV and adenovirus) in induced sputum between clinically stable asthmatics and controls. Nevertheless, when examining bronchial tissue, it has been reported that rhinovirus is more frequently detected in clinically stable asthmatics as compared to controls (12). This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in viral presence between airway tissue and intraluminal samples. The latter is supported by a recent cross\u2010sectional study examining 13 respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage also showing similar detection rates between asymptomatic asthmatic children and controls (25). Taken together, the present data suggest that respiratory viruses are not more prevalent in the intraluminal airways of asthmatics as compared to controls.",

However, when collectively examining all sampling techniques for each subject, 30% of the asthmatics showed virus positivity at a given visit (1, 2). Hence, different detection rates between studies are likely to be because of technical, temporal and/or biological factors, as invasive methods are sampling different locations of the respiratory tract where viral presence may differ from regions sampled by noninvasive methods (13). Although some studies concluded that nasal washes are slightly more sensitive in viral detection than swabs (26), others have reported that their sensitivity is equal in adults (27). We chose the latter, because nasal swabs are easier to carry out than nasal washes and are causing less discomfort. We observed particularly low detection rate in the gelatine\u2010filtered expired air and the EBC, which was not unexpected (28). Even though the sampling rates did not differ significantly between the five techniques in the present study, our results suggest that induced sputum may represent a better option in this respect. This fits in with previous studies using induced sputum for viral detection (13, 29) and suggests there is a discrepancy between upper and intrapulmonary airway sampling with regard to the detection of respiratory viruses in asthma and controls.",

On top of this, we added objective criteria to confirm or exclude variable airways obstruction in patients and controls, respectively. Furthermore, the distinction between mild and severe asthma was based on objective and quantitative criteria, including medication usage (17). We were careful to exclude patients who had symptoms of respiratory infections in the past 4 weeks. This timing may not totally exclude the possibility of a recent viral illness, because experimental infections have shown that viruses can occasionally persist in the lower airways for more than 4 weeks (30). Finally, we cannot exclude a medication bias, particularly regarding the dose of inhaled steroids, between the groups. However, this difference was inevitable when selecting mild and severe asthma.",

This pentaplex approach is increasingly applied to routine practice of molecular diagnostics for the respiratory viruses, showing an almost complete concordance between the multiplex PCR and the corresponding single\u2010target PCR (15). Although crossing point (CP) values could give some indication of high or low viral loads, the assay is essentially qualitative and does not allow statements about replicative properties of the virus in the airways of asthmatic patients and healthy controls. The implicit limitation of our approach is that we did not test for the presence of other nonviral respiratory pathogens that have been linked to the persistence and severity of asthma. This was beyond the objective of the present study. Finally, the current sample size provided a power of 0.80 to detect differences of 2.5\u2010fold between the groups. We reasoned that clinical or pathophysiological relevance could only be obtained at >2\u2010fold differences in viral detection rates between the groups. That is why we accepted a 2.5\u2010fold difference with 12 subjects per group. Rather than expanding the sample size, and thereby increasing the statistical power, we chose to sample each subject at three subsequent time points. Therefore, the present sample size does not suffice to detect smaller differences in virus detection rates between the groups. This should be taken into account when designing future studies.",

Regardless of the sampling techniques used in the present study, it appears that the identification of viruses in the airways of patients with clinically stable asthma does not exceed those in normal controls. Neither was there a difference between severe and mild asthma. This suggests that pre\u2010existing inflammation and/or impaired innate immune defence do not enhance viral presence in the airways in asthma (31). However, by using 6\u2010week sampling windows, we cannot exclude the possibility that pre\u2010existing cytokine profiles or airway inflammation in asthma may still impede viral clearance in asthma (32). Nevertheless, none of the samples showed consistent presence of viruses in individual subjects between 0, 6 and 12 weeks. The variability of virus strains over time extends previous findings in infants (33) and illustrates that series of infections rather than persistent infections occur both in asthmatic and in healthy adults. Taken together, our findings argue against the hypothesis that the maintenance and severity of asthma are driven by persistent virus infections.",

Nevertheless, the detection of bocavirus was surprising, because this has been reported mainly in paediatric patients with respiratory diseases, but rarely in adults (35, 36). This may suggest a link between host characteristics or medication usage and the presence of bocavirus virus in the airways in asthmatics. This needs to be confirmed by larger prospective studies in asthmatics and controls. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the presence of atopy with or without exposure to relevant allergens may have affected our results. However, this question was beyond the scope of the present study. Finally, it cannot be excluded that other microbes than respiratory viruses are influencing the maintenance and course of asthma, because a recent study based on culture independent, PCR techniques provided evidence suggestive of differential bacterial presence in bronchial brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage between clinically stable asthmatics and controls (36).",
