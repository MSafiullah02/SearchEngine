Governments had initially sought to react to the emergent threat of AIDS through traditional infectious disease practices\u2014including compulsory testing, named reporting, travel restrictions, isolation and quarantine, and other rights derogations\u2014yet human rights were seen as a protection against these intrusive government infringements on individual liberty and a bond for stigma-induced cohesion among HIV-positive activists.29 In this period of emerging rights-based activism, Jonathan Mann\u2019s tenure at the World Health Organisation (WHO) marked a turning point in the application of individual human rights to public health policy, viewing discrimination and coercion as counterproductive to public health goals and applying human rights to focus attention on the individual risk behaviours leading to HIV transmission.30 Mann\u2019s vocal leadership of the WHO Global Programme on AIDS, formally launched in 1987, shaped formative efforts to create a rights-based framework for global health governance and national health policy.31 Drawing from international human rights standards, public health policies came to stress the need for risk reduction programs to respect and protect human rights as a means to achieve the individual behaviour change necessary to reduce HIV transmission.32\n",

Incorporated into international law, such a normative focus on underlying determinants of health was elevated in the aftermath of World War II through the holistic goal proclaimed by states in the WHO Constitution: \u2018health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u2019.43\n",

However, those in the sanatoriums enjoyed access to higher food rations, specialized care for HIV, and relief from employment responsibilities, benefits that were seen as especially advantageous during Cuba\u2019s post-Cold War economic crisis, known as the \u2018special period\u2019.53 While the government has stepped away from these rights-infringing practices\u2014employing the sanatoriums now as training centres for HIV diagnosis, education, and care management\u2014Cuba continues to have one of the lowest rates of HIV/AIDS in the region, a public health outcome attributed their early rights-restricting HIV containment practices.54 The 2014\u201316 Ebola Virus Disease epidemic similarly highlighted how well-intentioned public health efforts can infringe individual rights. In Liberia, residents of the West Point neighbourhood were quarantined despite a lack of evidence that the virus was more prevalent there than elsewhere in the country. In the United States, a nurse who tested negative for Ebola was nevertheless confined to isolation, although a court would later overturn this derogation of her rights and restriction on her movement.55 Setting a precedent for current lockdowns during the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic, these examples highlight the need for scientific evidence in public health decision making, even in the course of ongoing infectious disease outbreaks; where there is little scientific information related to new and emerging pathogens, research is warranted to understand the threats such pathogens pose to the public\u2019s health and the responses that are necessary to prevent disease.

In the case of vaccine opposition (particularly for childhood vaccinations), parents must balance their perceived risk of vaccines against the potential negative outcomes of infection.61 For many years, this debate was assuaged by broad acceptance of childhood vaccinations (bolstered by vaccine mandates for school enrollment), which led to substantial decreases in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases and the establishment of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 at the population level without the need for vaccine mandates.62 In this way, childhood vaccination programmes have become a victim of their own success. The anti-vaccine movement\u2014fuelled in recent years by false concerns about vaccine safety, coupled with religious and philosophical exemptions to school-based vaccine requirements\u2014has provided an opening for the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases in places where they were previously rare.63 As exemptions to school vaccine mandates have increased, there has been a waning of herd immunity (also known as \u2018community protection\u2019) against vaccine-preventable disease. Community protection relies on such population immunity. It is this herd immunity, not individual disease immunity, that protects a given population. Therefore, those choosing not to vaccinate remain individually vulnerable to infections, which can then be transmitted throughout the community. On the global scale, while vaccines are most frequently viewed as crucial to public health, erroneous perceptions about vaccine safety continue to undermine the potential of vaccines to prevent infectious disease.64 This threat from individual refusal to adhere to public health guidelines is similarly seen among those flouting social distancing recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, public health professionals must re-examine not only individual autonomy, but also individual responsibility towards the community\u2014a concept which varies widely across cultural contexts.",

Colonized by three different colonial powers, the countries share a history of military coups, dictatorship, civil war, and strife, which have resulted in the destruction of virtually all health care infrastructures, widespread poverty, and a lack of trust in public institutions.87 Ebola capitalised upon these institutional weaknesses to create a perfect storm of public health, humanitarian, and human rights crises. The global community belatedly rushed to build Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), as nations are seeking today to build hospitals to take in COVID-19 patients, but could offer little in terms of treatment. As seen in the early COVID-19 response, the shortage of surge capacity for face masks, ventilators, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and other essential medical equipment underscores that the global community has not yet learned the importance of public health preparedness.

Despite this, nearly 30 countries had imposed travel bans by November 2014, including Australia and Canada, both high-income countries with developed public health systems.151 To assure greater compliance with future recommendations, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan called in October 2015 for accountability mechanisms under the IHR, including sanctions for countries that restrict international travel and trade.152 This was echoed in the report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, tasked with reviewing the IHR and WHO in response to the Ebola epidemic.153 However, other independent reviews such as the Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola concluded that economic incentives and the use of existing WHO powers to publicly examine countries\u2019 rationales for their health measures may be more effective.154 Notwithstanding these universal recommendations to curtail unnecessary travel restrictions, nations have largely disregarded these WHO recommendations again in the COVID-19 response, with nationalist governments rapidly enacting emergency travel bans that have divided the world and threatened global governance while providing only marginal health benefits.155\n",

Rather than the traditional public health paradigm, the GHSA is framed through a \u2018securitisation\u2019 approach to disease, which views threats to public health as existential threats to national and international security, \u2018requiring emergency measures and justifying actions outside the normal bounds of political procedure\u2019.162 Conceptually, the process of securitising socio-economic issues is not inherently in conflict with human rights. For example, the concept of \u2018human security\u2019 arose from human rights-based approaches to development.163 WHO has described global health security as addressing \u2018vulnerabilities to acute public health events\u2019,164 and this description is consistent with how international human rights law frames the right to health. However, global health security is rarely presented in current policy discourse through the lens of human rights.165 As seen in the modern history of infectious disease control\u2014from HIV to Ebola to COVID-19\u2014governments have used public health emergencies to rationalise limitations on, or in some cases derogations from, their obligations under international human rights law. Framing certain infectious diseases as risks to security can normalise what would otherwise be extraordinary measures, undermining the justifications behind necessary limitations of human rights under international law. Further, if an infectious disease arises that is deemed a threat to national or international security, there is a risk that primary decision-making authority can shift from public health decision-makers to national security institutions.166 For example, during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the UN Security Council stepped into the realm of global health through the adoption of Resolution 2177, which determined that the \u2018unprecedented extent of the Ebola outbreak in Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security\u2019.167 This resolution highlighted the potential for \u2018forum shopping\u2019 global health threats\u2014from health governance to security governance\u2014leading to security-based policies that may conflict with health and human rights goals, as seen in autocratic emergency responses to COVID-19 that have drawn the scrutiny of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, public health professional societies, and human rights non-governmental organizations.168 Rather than supporting infectious disease control efforts, such conflicts can undermine effective collaboration between domestic public health and national security authorities responsible for the infectious disease response.169\n",

Through the JEE process, more than sixty countries have undergone external evaluations of their IHR core capacity compliance to highlight gaps in capacities and set priorities for full IHR implementation.170 However, such a securitization approach funded by high-income countries inherently prioritises threats to high-income countries.171 Neglected diseases or diseases that do not pose a security threat to wealthy nations are unlikely to trigger the financing and capacity building necessary for infectious disease governance, forcing low-income countries to rely solely on traditionally underfunded humanitarian approaches to some pressing infectious disease threats. The securitization approach imparts obligations on low-income countries that prioritises surveillance of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases, which may not reflect the immediate public health priorities of that country.172 Despite this, the strengthening of public health systems for emerging or re-emerging diseases is hoped to have flow-on effects that benefit infectious diseases that do not fit within the securitisation paradigm. This was demonstrated in the reverse (i.e., humanitarian investment advancing health security) in Nigeria during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic, when polio surveillance and response systems were able to transform quickly to detect cases and conduct subsequent contact tracing, and now as Ebola surveillance and response systems are being repurposed for COVID-19 control.173\n",

It is imperative that any risk that an infectious disease poses to the economic or political integrity of the nation does not override parallel risks to human rights.

There must be accountability for human rights in national policy and global governance, codified through the adoption of: interpretive general comments on infectious disease control from human rights treaty bodies; WHO human rights guidance for IHR implementation that is assessed through the IHR Review Process; and revised human rights derogation standards prepared by an independent body of experts, involving civil society, global health lawyers, and other public health experts in the field.
