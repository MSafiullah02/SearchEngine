In most cases, the birds show respiratory problems such as nasal and/or ocular discharge and other respiratory distress, poor performance, decreased egg production, poor egg shell quality, reduced hatchability, nephritis and sometimes false layers, however, the clinical signs caused by IBV infection can be diverse and nonspecific. The infection is often complicated by secondary opportunistic agents such as Escherichia coli (Dwars et al., 2009; Vandekerchove et al., 2004), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Georgiades et al., 2001) and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (Vandekerchove et al., 2004), and combinations of IBV with other pathogens can seriously increase the level of damage (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008).",

            "text": "IBV has a linear, single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity of ~27 kb in length and produces enveloped virions. IBV particles consist of four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M), small envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is formed by post-translational cleavage of S into two separate polypeptide components, S1 and S2 (Cavanagh, 1983, Cavanagh, 2007). S1 mediates virion attachment to host cells (Casais et al., 2003) and is a target of neutralizing antibodies in chickens (Cavanagh et al., 1986). Mutation and recombination in the genome, especially in the S1 gene, may give rise to variants or new genotypes that may escape from the protection offered by the immunity induced by the classical vaccination programs (Cavanagh, 2007). Hence, genotyping of IBV is associated primarily with changes in the amino acid sequence of the S1 subunit (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Kant et al., 1992), and evolutionary characterization of IBV is mainly based on analysis of the S1 gene (Lee et al., 2003; Wang et al., 1994).",

Six genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of interlineage recombinants have been defined worldwide by phylogenetic analysis with the complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene (Valastro et al., 2016). Recently, two additional types of IBV that are genetically distinct from those of the 32 lineages and interlineage recombinants were found in China by phylogenetic analysis of complete nucleotide sequences of S1 genes of a number of IBV isolates (Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017). They were defined as lineages 28 and 29 in genotype I (GI-28 and GI-29, respectively). This large diversity of lineages/genotypes is a major reason why commercial vaccines often fail or only provide partial protection against IBVs, and therefore, new IB outbreaks continue to occur in vaccinated chicken flocks.",

This shows that the Chinese IBV situation is complex and variable, and causes serious economic losses in the Chinese poultry industry. In addition, IB outbreaks also occur in well-vaccinated flocks using different serotype vaccines and vaccination programs. This raises the question of whether new IBV variants, against which vaccines induce an insufficient level of cross-protection, are involved. In our conventional surveillance of IB between January 2016 and December 2017 in China, broilers and layer chickens with suspected IB with associated respiratory problems, nephritis and reduced egg production frequently occurred. In the present study, cloacal swabs and tissue samples were collected from 211 and 590 commercial chicken flocks, respectively. Two hundreds and thirteen IBVs were isolated and the complete nucleotide sequence of S1 genes were sequenced and analyzed. The aims of the study were to gather recent data, update knowledge of the circulating IBV field strains, and obtain a wider picture of IBV genetic diversity to understand better the epidemiology of IBVs circulating in chicken flocks in China in recent years.",

In all cases, Massachusetts (Mass) type H120 or Ma5 vaccines had been used at 1 day old by coarse spray or oculonasal route. A second vaccination with 4/91 or other vaccine, such as LDT3-A, was also common between 15 and 20 days old. From a given flock on each farm, >20 cloacal swabs were collected. Tissue samples from the trachea, lungs and kidneys were obtained from more than three birds from each flock. The cloacal swabs or tissue samples from the same flock were pooled and used for viral isolation. Hence, a pool of cloacal swabs or tissues represented one sample. The cloacal swabs were placed in 1 ml buffered peptone water and kept at 4 \u00b0C until use.",

Viral isolation was performed by inoculation of 9-day-old embryonated, specific pathogen-free (SPF) hens' eggs (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences) via the allantoic cavity route with the supernatant from the homogenates or cloacal swabs. For each sample, three eggs were used for viral isolation. Eggs were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and candled daily (Liu and Kong, 2004). Embryos that died within 24 h after inoculation were discarded. On day 3 after inoculation, 100 \u03bcl allantoic fluid was collected from each egg, using a 26 gauge needle, through a small hole created in the shell near the air sac (Hewson et al., 2012). The allantoic fluids from the three eggs were pooled and 50 \u03bcl pooled allantoic fluids were used to detect IBV using RT-PCR assays with two set of primers targeting two conserved regions in the IBV genome. The remaining allantoic fluids were blind passaged 3\u20138 times in SPF eggs until the typical embryonic lesions of IBV infection were observed. The eggs were incubated for further 4 days after the allantoic fluids were collected and observed for typical embryonic lesions of IBV infection, such as dwarfing, stunting, and curling, with feather dystrophy.",

Such prevalence is mostly higher compared to that of other lineages/genotypes detected in chicken flocks in China. The GI-19 viruses were first isolated more than two decades ago and were previously established as a new genotype based on the molecular nature of the S1 gene (Liu and Kong, 2004). Currently, these IBV strains have become some of the most widely distributed in many countries (Valastro et al., 2016) that have major poultry production. Viral neutralization studies have revealed that this lineage represents a novel serotype (Gao et al., 2016). In general, outbreaks of IB are associated with immunological escape of antigenically distinct strains that have originated from natural selection (Toro et al., 2006). Mechanisms for the generation of variation in coronaviruses, like IBV, include nucleotide insertions, deletions, or point mutations in the S1 gene made by the viral polymerase (Kusters et al., 1987; Jia et al., 1995), RNA recombination, and small changes in the S2 subunit that can alter the structure of S1 (Callison et al., 1999). In some cases, new IBV genotypes/serotypes can emerge as a result of only a few changes in the amino acid sequences of the S protein. In this study, different sublineages were found within the established GI-19 lineage in the phylogeny, and sublineages A and E were the predominant types of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in China. In general, isolates in the same sublineages shared higher levels of nucleotide and amino acid identities to those of isolates in different sublineages. Multiple point mutations were observed across the S1 gene of viruses in the GI-19 lineage, although unique mutations were found in each sublineage. In addition, deletions were found in some viruses in sublineages A and E and were mainly located in epitope D in HVRI. These results confirmed that GI-19 lineage had evolved into different sublineages and there was a high degree of S1 gene variation among the GI-19 lineage viruses. Amino acid differences of even a few residues can be responsible for different structural predictions that can create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which may affect the quaternary structure of the spike glycoprotein. The antigenic variation caused by the substitutions and deletions in viruses of GI-19 lineage, especially in viruses in different sub-lineages, requires further investigation.",

As in other countries and regions, IBV H120 and Ma5 vaccines are among the commonly used live IBV vaccines in commercial poultry in China. Live IBV vaccine is able to spread extensively within groups of chickens vaccinated at day of hatching or at 15 days of age (Matthijs et al., 2008). In some cases, the IBV vaccine can induce mild signs (such as nasal discharge) of IB shortly after administration (Matthijs et al., 2003, Matthijs et al., 2005, Matthijs et al., 2008), and increases the susceptibility of 4-week-old broilers to colibacillosis to a similar extent as the virulent IBV strain (Matthijs et al., 2005). In addition, the variable virulence of the vaccine viruses when they are coadministered and the ability of some of the combinations to cause severe tracheal damage have been reported (Awad et al., 2016). Most of the diseased broilers in which IBV vaccine-like viruses were isolated in this study showed mild to severe colibacillosis when they were approximately 4 weeks old. Hence, the isolation of IBV vaccine-like (H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A) viruses in this study was not surprising. Although we found that vaccine-like viruses were reisolated in this study, an issue that needs more work is the ability to differentiate the reisolation of vaccine strains from field strains of the same serotype. That is usually done at the level of homology between the sequences of the S gene or a part of it, such as the S1 region, due to the lack of virulence markers.",

Two years later, TC07\u20132-like viruses were also isolated in Japan and Korea, and designated as JP-IV (Mase et al., 2010) and new cluster 2 (Lim et al., 2012) genotypes, respectively. Later, TC07\u20132-like viruses were designated as GVI-1 by phylogenetic analysis using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene from 13 IBV isolates in China and Korea between 2007 and 2012 (Valastro et al., 2016). We isolated four GVI-1 viruses in this study from four provinces in China between 2016 and 2017. Although the origin of GVI-1 viruses in China is not clear and it is not the main type of IBV in China, GVI-1 IBVs have been isolated from vaccinated chickens from different regions in different years in China, indicating that this IBV lineage is still circulating in chicken flocks and is endemic in China. The characteristics of the viral evolution, antigenicity, tissue tropism and pathogenicity of this IBV lineage remain poorly understood and require further investigation.",

            "text": "It is believed that recombination as a consequence of mixed infections by different IBV field strains, and widespread use of various vaccines made from heterotypic IBVs in the fields, may play important roles in the emergence of novel genetic IBV variants (Liu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Leghari et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017). We isolated and identified seven novel isolates in this study that were genetically distinct from those of other IBV strains isolated in this study and circulated in other parts of the world, and demonstrated that they originated from recombination events. It was not surprising to find that six of the viruses originated from recombination events between 4/91 vaccine and GI-19 strains because the commonly used 4/91 vaccine could not provide enough protection against the predominant GI-19 lineage circulating in China. This could make the two lineages coexist in some chicken flocks and would make such recombination events possible (Han et al., 2017). In addition, it is important to take into consideration that recombination between distantly related clades (lineages) is easier to detect than between closely related viruses, for which there are few phylogenetic signals. Therefore, it was likely that recombination events between more closely related viruses, i.e., within a lineage, expectedly remained undetected in this study. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the presence of some isolates in this study might have been caused, at least partially, by mutations of the S1 gene associated with recombination events between the field and vaccine strains, although the biological characteristics of these recombinants requires to be elucidated.",

In this study, we identified two different IBVs and isolated the viruses in the same tissue sample from each of the eight flocks. It is possible that multiple IBV populations/types in the same bird (some were the vaccine strains often used in chicken flocks) could lead to high genetic diversity and frequent recombination, which suggests the potential for emergence of divergent and novel IBV coronaviruses. It is reported that co-infection of IBV with other respiratory pathogens, such as avian influenza subtype H9, can increase the level of damage to birds (Georgiades et al., 2001; Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008). However, the effects of co-infection by multiple populations/types of IBV strains on the birds are unknown and should be investigated further.",
