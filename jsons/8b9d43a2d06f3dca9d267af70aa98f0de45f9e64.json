Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) induced respiratory failure is a condition of low mortality but imposes a high burden on the intensive care unit (ICU) during winter. Early prediction of severely effected infants may be useful for targeting new therapies. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for length of ventilation (LOV) based on parameters within the first 24 hours of ICU stay. METHODS. Prospective data collection on 111 RSV + infants in a regional ICU over two consecutive winter seasons. Eleven were excluded (10 congenital heart disease, 1 neuromuscular disorder) leaving 100 for analysis. Ventilatory strategy has been reported previously.1 All arterial blood gases and concomitant ventilator settings were recorded over the first 24 hours after admission. The best, worst, mean, mean of 3 (8 hours apart) and adjusted mean (beat and worst removed) were calculated for oxygenation index (OI), Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and ventilation index. Additional data included birth weight, gestation, chronic lung disease (CLD), age at admission, and bacterial chest infection on admission. RESULTS. There were no deaths. The median (IQ1-IQ3) LOV was 106 (72\u00b1139) hours. The multiple linear regression model employing the \u00aabest\u00ba values gave the highest predictive value for LOV. The only independent predictor of LOV from this model was best OI (p = 0.002). However, this had little clinical value in predicting LOV for individual patients r2 = 0.27, SEE 71 hours. An alternative logistic approach was employed, defining the top quartile for LOV as a \u00aabad\u00ba outcome (LOV > 137 hours). Again \u00aabest\u00ba OI in the first 24 hours had the only significant association (p = 0.002) with bad outcome, although CLD approached significance (p = 0.06). The maximum predictive value for bad outcome was a best OI of > 7.9. This gave: spec 99 %, sens 32 %, PPV 89 %, NPV 81 %, LR 25. Nosocomial chest infection ( > 48 hours after admission) occurred in 10/25 with bad outcome and only 4/75 good outcome (Fisher's exact p < 0.001, OR 11.8.). CONCLUSION. Prolonged LOV can be predicted from the best OI in the first 24 hours following admission with high specificity. The sensitivity of this model is limited by the occurrence of nosocomial infection.

Human and animal studies suggest that Conventional Mechanical Ventilation (CMV) may promote over-distention-induced pulmonary lesions, which could contribute to further lung injury.

High Frequency Percussive Ventilation (HFPV) is a form of protective ventilator strategy that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults and children with inhalation injury (1,2).

Clinical criteria included in scores include: cyanosis (or saturation < 92 %), respiratory rate, level of consciousness, breath sounds, presence of stridor, presence of pulsus paradoxus, retractions (1 and 2) METHODS. Ethical approval was obtained and parents consented to and were present during the studies. Studies were performed on 20 patients (aged 3.6 to 23.6 months, median 11.7) with clinically severe croup and 5 normal controls (aged 5 to 31 months, median 13) undergoing EEG as part of investigation of seizures. Children were sedated with chloral hydrate (50\u00b175 mg/kg). We recorded tidal intrathoracic pressure changes (DPes cm H 2 O) with a waterfilled oesophageal catheter-manometer and air-flow using a face-mask and Fleisch #1 pneumotachograph. Polygraph traces were digitized. We made the following measures of respiratory mechanics: Frequency (f min-1), Tidal volume (VT ml/kg), Minute ventilation (VE ml/kg/ min), Peak inspiratory flow rates (VINSP ml/s), Pressure Time Product (PTP cm H 2 O.s.min-1) and Pressure Time integral (PTINT cm H 2 O.s.min-1). RESULTS. No croup patient was clinically cyanosed and on the 14 patients where saturation data was available, median saturation was 95 % (range 92\u00b1100 %).

Results are shown in Table 1 . The mean ICP was significantly higher in the disabled survivors than in those who made a full recovery (p < 0.01). The CPP, however, was not statistically different (p > 0.2) between these two groups. CONCLUSION. As would be expected, the patients had higher mean ICPs in the worse outcome groups. However, goal directed therapy to maintain CPP, although apparently successful, did not appear to prevent permanent neurological impairment in a significant number of patients.

The distribution of the drug in the airways is influenced by several factors, related to the patients, to the ventilator and its circuit, to the drug used and the route of administration. Since the use of an external PEEP (PEEPe) could reduce lung inhomogeneity (1), we reasoned that the administration of salbutamol in presence of an applied PEEPe should improve the efficacy of this therapy. METHODS. Five flow limited COPD with ARF were studied before and after administration of four puffs of salbutamol. The presence of FL was detected by the NEP test. During the drug administration patients were randomly ventilated in assisted-control ventilation (a) on ZEEP and (b) with an applied PEEPe equal to 70 % of the value of intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi). Then six hours later the same patient was given of the drug in the opposite way. Data of respiratory mechanics were determined on ZEEP by the constant flow rapid occlusion method, which allowed to calculate maximal, minimal and additional resistance (Rmax,rs; Rmin,rs; Drs) and PEEPi RESULTS. The administration of bronchodilating agents with PEEPe was associated to a greater reduction of Rmin,rs [-20 % (a) VS \u00b136 % (b)] and PEEPi [-6 % (a) VS 16 % (b)] when compared to the administration on ZEEP (table 1) .

METHODS. twenty patients were studied, 8 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 8 with moderate acute lung injury (ALI), and 4 with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF), all on controlled mechanical ventilation with constant flow.

There was no significant difference for parametres of control of breathing (VT, RR, Vt/Ti, Ti/Ttot, P0.1) between myasthenic patients and the control group. Data is summarized in the following METHODS. Two hundred and ten patients with several etiologies in weaning process were evaluated ( all of then with FiO 2 < 0.4 and PEEP < 8 cmH 2 O). The age ranged between 17 and 94 years. APACHE II ranged between 2 and 40 (mean 17.7). Success in weaning was obtained in 182 patients ( those who were not reintubated in the following 48 hours after the definitive disconnection from the mechanical ventilator ). The ventilators used were Evita 1 and 2 ( Drager \u00b1 Germany ). The four predictive parameters were measured before the definitive disconnection from the mechanical ventilation. Clinical and neurological stability were indispensable for the admission of the patients in the study. METHODS. Twenty one patients who needed mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours in a general intensive care unit were prospectively evaluated in a randomized cross-over study. All patients were submitted to the three methods (EPAP, PSV and T-piece) during 30 minutes. Each method was followed by a rest time (at least 30 minutes), They were monitored by Vent-Track (Novametrix, USA). Parameters, measured at 1 and 30 minutes, were: work of breathing (WOB), minute ventilation (MV), arterial oxygenation (SatO 2 ), end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ), heart and respiratory rate (HR and RR), mean arterial pressure (MAP). Comparisons were done by a one way analysis of variance and t test. The level of significance was p < 0.05. RESULTS. The preliminary results obtained with the three methods were: The differences in the median values among the treatments groups are greater then would be expected by chance in WOB (p value = 0.001*), MV (p value = 0.002**) and SatO 2 (p value = 0.004***). (*EPAP different from PSV, PSV different from T-piece and EPAP different from T-piece; **EPAP different from PSV and PSV different from T-piece; *** EPAP different from T-piece and PSV different from T-piece). Comparison between ETCO 2 , HR, RR and MAP obtained at 1 and 30 min were not different. CONCLUSION. Those preliminary results showed that EPAP offered greater WOB than PSV or T-piece, smaller MV than PSV but similar to T-piece and similar SatO 2 to PSV but greater than T-piece. In general, EPAP offered no advantage over the other methods in patients weaning from mechanical ventilation. ",

We present this work to show that with the limited ressources of a non universitary hospital a motivated team may create a costumized tool which meet the special needs of an ICU. CONCLUSION. Based on our results, it is possible to establish polysomnography in the ICU and to achieve a valid diagnosis of sleep disorders. Polysomnography is not yet an instrument for routine diagnostic, but can become a valuable sophisticated method of examination. Especially educated staff is needed for its use. It could be shown that sleep disorders in intensive care medicine are a relevant problem. METHODS. The period of the study was from December 1994 to March 2001 in the Hospital Espanhol in Rio de Janeiro, a 64 bed-hospital oriented to high level elective surgery, basically oncologic. We addopted the model of complete outsourcing, including all the process in the ICU. Then, it was included purchase or rent of medical equipment, all the salaries and taxes, acquisition and sell of medical matherial and drugs, to make the bill and all other activities envolved in the ICU process.",

This complete model, with all process, including pharmacy and nurses, seem to us the best, although they have more complexity and need a high cost management, compared to other outsourcing models. The set up costs are also higher. During this 7 years, we have payed to the hospital 17 % of our bill and we have had a liquid profit of 6 % CONCLUSION. Outsourcing is a good option to hospitals which don't know or don't want to manage the risks of an ICU. The complete model is the best, considering major flexibitity against high costs, giving better profits and payment of better salaries, although the risks of bad managementand bankrupt are bigger. The liquid profit for the ICU managerial group are around 6 % and the hospital receive 17 % of the bill without any risk or cost. . We report a 22 year old man who was admitted with pruritus and jaundice in December 2000 for the first time. The patient was known to suffer from chronic hepatitis C for years, which had been treated unsuccessfully with interferon A and ribavirin. Two weeks before the first admission he had taken anabolic steroids (silabolin and nandrolone) by i. m. injection for body building. The clinical examination revealed an impressive icterus and numerous scratch marks. Total serum bilirubine was 10.8 mg/dl at this time, the direct bilirubin 9.71 mg/dl. There was a slight increase of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, blood cell count and prothrombin time were normal. Liver biopsy showed a portocentral cholestasis with mild portal cell infiltration. Treatment with cetirizine, a histamine (H1) blocker, and naltrexon, an opioid antagonist, was not effective. Administration of phenobarbital for enzyme induction failed to reduce hyperbilirubinemia and to ameliorate clinical symptomes. Since itching and jaundice worsened and the bilirubin level rose to 30 mg/dl, the patient was re-admitted to hospital in January 2001. METHODS. The molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) was connected with a hemofiltration device (Baxter BM 14 + BM 11). MARS contains a synthetic hydrophilic/hydrophobic domain-presenting semipermeable membrane (pore size smaller than albumin size, 100nm thick). The opposite side of this membrane is rinsed with ligandin-like proteins (albumin) as molecular adsorbents that are regenerated online using a chromatography-like recycling system [2] . Anticoagulation was performed by continuous infusion of heparin. Three MARS sessions were run: 9 hours at day 1, 18 hours at day 2 and 24 hours at day 5. Laboratory values were controled before, 6 hours after start and at the end of albumin dialysis. RESULTS. The procedure was well tolerated by the patient. There were no haemodynamic changes and no bleeding events. The patient\u00a2s condition significantly improved from the first session. INTRODUCTION. Endotoxemia with subsequent cellular and organ failure currently still is a serious and important complication in intensive care treatment. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is a non-toxic hydrolysed derivative of lipid A, which has been suggested to have positive immunmodulatoric influences with induction of endotoxin tolerance as a prophylactic and therapeutical intervention. Aim of the study was to objectivy the effect of pretreatment with MPL to cellular metabolism after induction of endotoxaemia using in vivo microdialysis.",

INTRODUCTION. The typical electrocardiographic pattern associated with central nervous system diseases is characterized by deeply inverted or tall T waves, prolongation of the QT interval, and prominent U waves (1,2,3). The aim of this study is to examine the kind of ECG changes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage in ICU. METHODS. The study group was consisted of 34 patients (14 male and 20 female) of average age 65 years. The youngest was 42 and the oldest 77. There were 20 patients with haemathoma regio capsularis (11 dex. and 9 sin.), 9 with haemathoma intracerebralis reg.temporoparietalis (6 dex. and 3 sin.) and 5 with haemorrhagio subarchnoidalis. ECG changes were evaluated during the first 72 hours from receiving in the ICU and shortly before discharge. RESULTS. The most common ECG abnormalities associated with central lesions that we found were: elevated, peaked, or notched T waves in 20 patients (58,8 %) , prolongation of the Q-T interval in 19 patients (55,8 %), ST segment depression in 11 patients (32,2 %), increased P-wave amplitude in 6 patients (17,6 %), flattening or inversion of the T wave, and U waves in 5 patients (14,6 %),increased QRS voltage in 5 patients (14,6 %) and ST segment elevation in 4 patients (11,7 %). We didn't register increased Q waves. INTRODUCTION. Controversy persist regarding the optimal management of patients with Hunt and Hess (H-H) grades IV and V after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although more than 90 % of these patients die if untreated, many physicians remain reluctant to aggressively treat them. However, a more aggressive management, including the early aneurysm obliteration, could decrease this high mortality (1).

Half of the units used an intraparenchymal device, 8 (40 %) used subarachnoid bolts, 4 (20 %) used a epidural or subdural device, and 5 (25 %) used an intraventricular catheter. Five units used more than one device. An ICP > 20 mmHg was reported by 85 % of adults ICUs as the threshold for elevated ICP, while 71 % of the pediatric ICUs considered 15 mmHg as the ICP threshold. The target cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was < 70 mmHg in 62 % of the adult ICUs while 85 % of the pediatric ICUs aimed for a CPP of < 50 mmHg. Fifty-two percent of the units routinely used mild hyperventilation of PaCO 2 30\u00b135 mmHg and 33 % of the units aimed for a PaCO 2 of 35\u00b140 mmHg.

INTRODUCTION. Blunt thoracic trauma that leads to intracardiac defect is uncommon, and usually connected with a high-speed traffic accident. We report a case of a ventricular septal defect combined with a lesion of tricuspidal valve and a rupture of pericardium in a polytrauma patient after falling from height. METHODS. 54 y. o. healthy man fell down from the height of approximately 15 m. He had a short time loss of consciousness with his Glasgow Coma Scale being 15 thereafter. Fractures of tibia, bilateral pubic rami, sacrum and ribs with paradoxical segment on the left side were diagnosed. Besides rib fractures his chest radiograph was normal on hospital admission. C-clamp was placed on pelvis and external fixator on tibia. Anaesthesia and recovery period were uneventful and the patient was sent to the general ward. Next morning the patient had an episode of rapid desaturation down to SpO 2 70 %. Auscultation revealed a newly appeared harsh systolic murmur and his neck veins were distended. On transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) he showed grave insufficiency of tricuspid valve with pulmonary hypertension and dilatation of the right heart. A left to right shunt was detected on the interventricular septum. As his clinical condition was deteriorating rapidly a decision of suturation of the ventricular septal defect was made. At the operation the inspection of the heart revealed no signs of myocardial contusion, but a pericardial rupture was found. After right ventriculotomy a midmuscular ventricular septal defect measuring 1,5 cm in diameter with contused / necrotic surrounding was found. Additional findings included an avulsion of the anterior tricuspid papillary muscle, valve leaflets themselves were not injured. Despite of reversal of Heparin effect and normalisation of the coagulation profile with 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 4 units of platelets, increased bleeding from mediastinal drains was detected, and on immediate resternotomy diffuse bleeding was seen. Total amount of postoperative mediastinal shed blood was 2000 ml. He needed inotropic support with dopamine and norepinephrine for the first 3 postoperative days.",

After several attempts he was finally extubated on the 12 th postoperative day and in his further course he had no cardiopulmonary problems. His ICU stay was 13 days. CONCLUSION. In the first stages of making the diagnosis of intracardiac injury after blunt thoracic trauma a high degree of suspicion is needed, and a close cooperation between intensivists, cardiac and trauma surgeons should follow, to achieve maximally aggressive treatment of the injuries. Prompt clinical diagnosis aided by echocardiography, and aggressive surgical intervention for repairing the lesions resulted in complete recovery of our patient. ",

Protocol: preoperative (preop), 2 hrs after surgery (postop), day 1 (D1), day 2 (D2). Innate immunity study: HLA-DR expression on monocyte (MO) (flow cytometry, Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)); plasma IL10 and IL12 p40 normalised by producing cells (ELISA); neuroendocrine mediators: ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (Norepi), dopamine (Dopa), prolactin (PL), arginin vasopressin (AVP) (Radio Immuno Assay). The impact of these mediators has been tested in 6-hr LPS stimulated whole blood culture (pl) and with plasma replaced by culture medium (Med, RPMI 1640 + FCS 10 %). LPS effect on MO HLA-DR, IL10 and IL12 p40 in each condition was expressed as Stim = LPS 6 hrs \u00b1 6 hrs without LPS. RESULTS. Preop MO HLA-DR did not differ from healthy and was depressed in postop (p < 0.01), with an altered response to LPS (table 1) . Postop inhibition was attenuated in culture medium, suggesting an impact of plasma factors. This inhibition was not related to plasma IL10 and IL12 p40 modifications. After LPS-stimulation in plasma as in medium, SZ had an anti-inflammatory profile (increase in IL10 / low IL12 p40 at D1) and MGB did not respond for both IL10 and IL12 p40. CONCLUSION. Blood innate immunity downregulation after brain surgery was profound, and sustained with hypo-stimulation capabilities. Such a pattern did not correlate with plasma IL10 and IL12 p40 levels. Cytokines release after stimulation is oriented towards anti-inflammation in SZ group, not in MGB group. Epi and cortisol impact seems negligible. A potential role of AVP and PL needs further investigations. High risk of infection may be related to the observed profound downregulation of innate immunity, in relation with an anti-inflammatory profile in SZ or global hyporesponsiveness in MGB. REFERENCE.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION. An impaired tissue oxygenation is thought to cause complications and prolonged length of ICU-stay (1). Dtetection of tissue hypoxemia is possible by global parameters (mixed-venous oxygen saturation, lactate-concentration) but also by gastric-mucosal tonometry, which is able to detect hypoperfusion in the hepato-splanchnic region. Since splanchnic hypoperfusion is thought to be an important piece of the puzzle in the developement of impaired tissue oxygenation gastric mucosal tonometry is able to predict states of organ-dysfunction. Similar results were found for the expression of procalcitonin which is thought to be a marker for states of systemic inflammation. There is evidence for a correlation between hypoperfusion and the onset of systemic inflammation. From a clinical point of view it is difficult to detect states of tissue dysoxia due to less sensitivity and specificity of markers available. In particular indicators of global haemodynamics have to be supplemented by regional and biochemical ones. Therefore the following study asked for a correlation between tonometric measurements to the expression of procalictonin regarding aspects of outcome in cardiac ICU-patients. METHODS. After IRB approval and written informed consent 98 patients admitted to the ICU after aortocoronary bypasse surgery (ASA III-IV) were studied. Beside standard monitoring each patient received a fiberoptic pulmonary catheter for continuous measurment of cardiac output and mixed-venous oxygen-saturation. As well a nasogastric catheter was introduced for semicontinuous recirculating gas-tonometry of the gastric mucosa. Documentation of haemodynamic and tonometric parameters, arterial and mixed-venous blood gas analysis, diuresis, temperature, use of volume and catecholamines followed every 60 min from admission to the ICU until transfer to the ward. Biochemical markers like CRP, Procalicitonin (PCT), Leucocytes were taken every 24 hours. For the diagnosis of splanchnic hypoperfusion the arterio-intestinal CO 2 -difference (aiDCO 2 ) was used. If a doubling of the aiDCO 2 occurs in the frist four hours of ICU-stay patients were defined as hypoperfused. Based on sociodemographic (age, sex) indicators and well-known scoring systems (ApacheII, SAPS) the sample was matched into hypoperfused (group 1) and non-hypoperfused (group 2) patients. These groups were analyzed considering haemodynamic and inflammatory aspects as well as on aspects of outcome. RESULTS. The following statistical significant results (p < 0.05) were found: Patients of group 1 had a longer length of ICU-stay. There was an increase in PCT-concentration in group 1 but nor in group 2 at the 2 nd day of ICU stay. Patients with highest PCT concentrations in group 1 showed a higher incidence of complications. No differences between groups were found in global indicators of haemodynamics and inflammation. CONCLUSION. A combination of PCT-measurments and gastric-tonometry occurs to be a suitable clinical tool for the early onset of tissue dysoxia. The pathophysiological basis of the indicators correlation has to be studied further.",

Study period 4 1/2 years (1.7.96\u00b131.12.00), permitted by the ethics comittee of the university of Ulm. Evaluation of problems and artefacts.RESULTS.Meanwhile 36 severely injured patients have been monitored during 59 sessions (4900 samples recorded). The medium age was 31 years [17 y \u00b1 93 y], the injury severity ISS 25 [9\u00b166], 33 % multi-system-trauma, 86 % head injury. The proper placement of the oesophageal echo-doppler-probe took a medium time of 93 sec [29 sec \u00b1 15 min]. Contraindications for the oesophageal probe like pharyngeal tamponade after severe maxillofacial injury occurred in two cases. The medium artefact rate per session was 22 % [0 % \u00b1 100 %], which was mainly caused by diagnostic and therapeutic manipulations in the patients face. Five of six patients with an ABF < 2 l/min at hospital admission died because of severe haemodynamic complications. One of them was not detected by conventional haemodynamic monitoring (RR,pulse). None of the patients with an initial ABF > 2 l/min developed letal haemodynamic conditions.CONCLUSION. The echo-doppler-sonographic measurement of aortic blood flow rapidly provides a noninvasive continous monitoring of central haemodynamic parameters, which are not registered by means of \u00aaconventional\u00ba monitoring. The predictive and therapeutic value of this new haemodynamic profile has to be shown in a larger collective of trauma patients.REFERENCES. 1. R. Muchada, et al.: Aortic Blood Flow Measurement.

Although these results are based on a limited number of patients, the use of PEEPe during salbutamol administration seems very promising in reduce inspiratory resistance and hence intrinsic PEEP.

Dept. of Surgical, Anesthesiological and Radiological Science. Section of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, S. Anna University Hospita, Ferrara, Italy INTRODUCTION. The use of an external PEEP (PEEPe) in presence of an intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi) has been recommended 1) to decrease the work of breathing 2) to improve patientventilator interaction by facilitate the patient to trigger the ventilator 3) to decrease lung inhomogeneity and ameliorate oxygenation [1]. However, little is known about the interaction between the use of PEEPe on PEEPi and the cardiac function in flow limited patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of PEEPi and different levels of PEEPe on cardiac output (CO).METHODS.Five sedated and paralyzed patients with expiratory flow limitation (FL) were enrolled in the study. The presence of FL was detected by the NEP test. CO was calculated by transesophageal ecocardiography. Patients were ventilated in assisted-control ventilation and data of respiratory mechanics were determined by the constant flow rapid occlusion method.CONCLUSION. The use of a PEEPe at a value of 70 % of PEEPi could be a safe and useful tools since it has apparently no influence on CO. However, this strategy had different influence on CO: in two patients consistently decreased, whilst in other two CO increased. In the remaining patient no variation was detected. This seems to imply that the effect of PEEPe on CO varies greatly among patients and hence non-invasive CO determination should be part of the monitoring of ICU patients with expiratory flow limitation to find the better value of PEEPi which assure the best patient-ventilator interaction and has no detrimental effect on CO. Values of PEEPe greater than PEEPi should be avoided since the dramatic effect on CO.METHODS.A 1-d point-prevalence study was performed with the aim of studying the characteristics of ICU, their patient population and methodology of mechanical ventilation. Inquiries were sent to all 50 ICU registered at the Portuguese Society of Intensive Care.RESULTS.We got responses from 29 ICU, with 194 in-patients at the moment of the study and 160 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, still intubated or with a tracheostomy and ventilated in the previous 24 h. The median occupational rate was 95 % and the median rate of ventilated patients was 85.4 %. The study patients were predominantly male (58.1 %), with a median age of 66, a median APACHE II of 21, a median duration of mechanical ventilation at the study CONCLUSION. 1. In Portugal indications for initiation of mechanical ventilation are similar to other published series [1]; 2. Half of the patients are ventilated in volume or pressure-controlled modes; 3. By far the preferred weaning method is pressure support; 4. The occupancy and rate of ventilated patients are higher than in other similar series [1].REFERENCE. Esteban A et al.

Critical Care and Emergencies Deparment, University Hospital Ciudad de Ja\u00d8n, Ja\u00d8n, Spain INTRODUCTION. in critical care ventilated patients we would expect that different methods of respiratory mechanics analysis to yield different results, because the respiratory mechanics of patients with lung injury are characterized by non-linear and heterogeneous behavior. Our objective was to compare the measurements of total resistance and dynamic elastance determined by different techniques of respiratory mechanics analysis based on the time or frequency domains.METHODS.In 18 sedoparalyzed patients who needed controlled mechanical ventilation for acute or chronic acute respiratory failure we studied: the total resistance and dynamic elastance. In the time domain were determined by the occlusion technique and by multiple linear regression. The Fourier analysis was used to study the impedance of the respiratory system for elastance and resistance values in the frequency domain. Airway flow was measured with a heated pneumotachograph interposed between the endotracheal tube and the Y piece of the ventilator.REFERENCES.

Once the patients with COPD generally present high respiratory frequency with lower tidal volume, we believe that it is less accurate in predicting the weaning outcome in these patients.

There are some interesting indicators that confirm the role of IL 6, IL 10 and their correlation with clinic and prognostic scores. On the other hand the highest levels in group B are probably in correlation with the different systemic inflammatory response registered in fungal infections. The various changes registered among cytokines is very interesting and needs further thorough examination. REFERENCE. Marin N and Dhainaut J-F \u00aaSepsis and acute lung injury\u00ba W.

Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is an acute phase protein facilitating the recognition of low concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by monocytes, thus being a sensitive marker during the onset of infections. The aim of the present study was to examine the time course of LBP serum levels in critically ill patients and of other inflammatory markers. METHODS. The study included 34 patients fulfilling 3 or more of the SIRS criteria. LBP (normal < 10 mg/ml), PCT (normal < 0.5 pg/ml), IL-6, CRP and WBC were determined daily over a period of 14 days. Scores recorded included APACHE II and SAPS II on admission and MODS and SOFA over time. In a control group of 20 patients after CABG, LBP, PCT and IL-6 values were studied before and 24 h after ECC. RESULTS. Mortality was 18 % (n = 6) in the ICU and 0 % in the ECC group. LBP levels never differentiated between survivors and non-survivors, whereas PCT levels were significantly different on days 4, 5, 6 and 7. However, the course of LBP levels over the ICU stay showed constantly decreasing values in survivors compared to elevated LBP levels in the nonsurvivor group. PCT was elevated in the control group after ECC (Mean 2.75 pg/ml) which was a fivefold increase compared to normal values, whereas LBP levels were 19.51 mg/ml. In patients with infection (29/34, CDC criteria), LBP levels were increased compared to those with non-infectious SIRS (41 mg/ml 15,34 vs.15.58 mg/ml 8.2, p < 0.05). PCT levels never differentiated between infection and non-infection. In six patients with infection there was no pathological PCT value whereas only one of those patients had no elevation in LBP.CONCLUSION.In this study LBP levels were consistently elevated in those patients suffering from proven infections, whereas PCT levels were not. Furthermore PCT showed a more pronounced increase than LBP in patients with non-infectious SIRS after ECC. Despite the fact that LBP did not differentiate significantly between survivors and non-survivors it seems to be an adequate and early marker for an ongoing infection in surgical ICU patients.REFERENCES. 1.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is believed to result from microcirculatory failure in surgical intensive care patients. We hypothesised that degree of MODS is mirrored by simple tests of microcirculatory function. Therefore, we compared reactive hyperaemia response in the forearm using transcutaneous PO 2 /PCO 2 electrodes and laser doppler velocimetry, microvascular permeability (strain-gauge plethysmography) in legs and gastric tonometrically derived variables in patients with moderate and severe MODS. METHODS. Twenty-two patients with MODS (1, moderate MODS group: less and equal 8 points, n = 13; severe MODS group: greater and equal 9 points, n = 9) were studied. All patients were monitored including a pulmonary artery catheter and a gastric tonometer during the study. Reactive hyperaemia in the forearm skin after an arterial occlusion of 5 min was investigated using a transcutaneous PO 2 /PCO 2 -electrode heated to 37 C and a laser doppler flowmeter (Periflux 4001,Perimed, J\u00e4rfella, Sweden). Fluid filtration capacity and isovolumetric venous pressure were assessed using a electromechanical sensor with automated calibration for straingauge plethysmography (Filtrass 2001, Domed GmbH, Germany) . In addition, arterial lactate concentrations, arterial-, mixed venous blood gas analysis and systemic haemodynamics were measured and systemic oxygen transport variables calculated . For statistical analysis paired Student's t-test and in cases of non-normal distribution the Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was performed. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data are given as means SD. RESULTS. There were no differences in age, systemic oxygen delivery, consumption and oxygen extraction ratio between groups. Mortality in patients with moderate MODS was 15.4 %, in patients with severe MODS 55.6 % (p = 0.049). Patients with high MODS demonstrated significantly higher arterial lactate concentrations (4.5 3 mmol/l) when compared with moderate MODS (1.7 0.9 mmol/l; p = 0.04).We observed no significant differences in gastric pHi, gastric regional to arterial PCO 2 difference, capillary filtration coefficient and isovolumetric venous pressure measured in legs and the magnitude of skin reactive hyperaemia response in the forearm between patients with moderate and severe MODS. . Until today there are no standardized criteria available for diagnosis of CLS. Aim of this study was to evaluate dynamic changes of intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI) as a diagnostic determinant for CLS.",

On the other hand the venous CCRS (vCCRS) is used for risk stratification in chronic heart failure (CHF) and sudden cardiac death (2). In the current study we aimed to apply both methods to MODS patients and we asked which method is most suitable for calculation of autonomic function in MODS.METHODS. 47 consecutive patients with MODS (APACHE II Score [AP II] > or = 20) were enrolled in this study. The aCCRS was calculated as regression slope of heart interval (HI) and PaO 2 . HI and PaO 2 were assessed at baseline, after 1/3 increase of FiO 2 and after returning to baseline (1). This regression slope was also used to calculate regression slope of HI and venous PO 2 and subsequently, called vCCRSreg. The vCCRS according to (2) was calculated as the ratio of HI alteration to that in venous PO 2 after 5 minutes of increase in FiO 2 . We also calculated this ratio for arterial PO 2 (aCRSratio). METHODS. An algorithm for haemodynamic treatment in SS, which established NA as the first drug (followed by dobutamine or adrenaline as required), was followed prospectively in all SS patients from December 1999 to August 2000. We evaluated Apache II and SOFA scores, and maximum values for C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate. Patients were classified in three groups according NA requirement: Mild shock, NA < 0.1 mg/kg/min; Moderate shock, NA from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/min; and, Severe shock, NA > 0.3 mg/kg/min.",
