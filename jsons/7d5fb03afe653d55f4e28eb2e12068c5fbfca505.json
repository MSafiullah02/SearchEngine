These CpGs came from an EWAS with n>=1000 in original and replication cohorts together with a validation stage before analysis of the second cohort. Genes associated with risk for mortality had been associated with specific environments (mainly smoking) and with a number of chronic diseases. While there have been a very small number of other potential biomarkers of mortality, your study is not based on methylation age and is therefore original and will be of wider interest to the scientific and medical community. Your data was based on the HM450 array and a sound statistical analysis. Conclusions were valid and based on validated and replicated data. I have 3 minor questions for you to address: 1. Please discuss the effect size (<5%) for significant CpG and what the implications of this are 2. As you didn't remove probes influenced by known SNPs (which I am not against), do you think that some of the risk is genetic rather than epigenetic in nature. It would be good to test this hypothesis if you have genetic data. 3. Do you have the data on medicaor family history with which to augment your risk model?",

None of the family history variables showed a significant association with fatal outcomes. Additional adjustment for them in the model estimating the association between risk score and mortality also led to very limited changes of the risk estimates as listed in the following Table 2 .

We then estimated individual and joint associations of cg03707168 and rs524 with all-cause mortality, adjusting for covariates as described in the main text. The results are listed in the following Table iii: cg03707168 was strongly associated with all-cause mortality irrespective of adjustment for rs524, whereas rs524 was not associated with all-cause mortality. And no interaction was detected between cg03707168 and rs524 (p=0.053). We add this information in the discussion (page 13, para 2; page 14, para 1) as follows:\"In the analysis we did not exclude probes that might be affected by known SNPs as annotated by'Infinium HD Methylation SNP List' (http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium_humanmethylation450_beadchip_kit/download s.html). We later retrieved data of 32 such SNPs for 24 identified CpGs in 581 ESTHER participants of the validation set. Only one SNP-CpG pair(rs524-cg03707168)showed a significant association. However, no association was observed between rs524 and all-cause mortality irrespective of controlling for DNAm of cg03707168, whereas the strong association of cg03707168 with mortality did not change when controlling for rs524. And no interaction was detected between rs524 and cg03707168 in relation to mortality. Nevertheless, potential genetic variants, i.e. methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for the identified candidates, should be systematically assessed in further studies.\"Table ii.
