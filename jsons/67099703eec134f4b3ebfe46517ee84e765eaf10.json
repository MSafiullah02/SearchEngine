The percentage of antibiotic prescriptions issued per telephone consultation reduced from 58.3% (31 st March to 6 th April) to under 30% for the next three weeks. The number of recementations and temporary dressings were low. Table 2 shows that 94.7% of extractions were successful with forceps or elevators. In 2.7% of cases we accepted that apical tips of roots (apical third) had been left, and the patient was informed. 2.7% of cases required the use of a drill to complete the extraction. 10.5% (2/19) patients who had an apical third of a root left returned for completion of extraction due to ongoing symptoms. Table 3 showed that three out of four patients who presented in primary care, had good reason to be seen in secondary care. Table 4 showed that Blackpool Victoria Hospital had no significant Emergency Department attendance rise due to COVID-19 and the suspension of normal dental services. Table 5 demonstrates that there was a range of patient exposure from 8.6 days per month to 10.5 days per month.",

In the next three weeks it was far lower (29.4%, 25.4% and 28.4%). This is suggestive that a large cohort of patients who were managed with AAA had not been successful, and were more willing to accept a dental extraction under local anaesthetic due to the ongoing pain or infection. This is also confirmed by the telephone consultation to extraction percentage increasing in the last three weeks (51.2%, 62.3%,50.5%) compared to the first two weeks (44.7%, 39.6%).",
