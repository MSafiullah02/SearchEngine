Reports indicated that polymorphism in the 5\u2032 regulatory region of the gene has been correlated with many infectious and inflammatory diseases [4, 5]. The association of TNF rs1799964 and rs1800630 polymorphisms with advanced\u2010stage endometriosis in the Korean population have been reported. The TNF rs1800750 polymorphism affects the binding of TF OCT\u20101 and alters the DNA\u2013protein interaction. The in vitro study of TNF promoter polymorphism function was stimulated by several case\u2013control studies of the polymorphism in relation to human disease [6]. The polymorphism rs361525 has been associated with insulin resistance syndrome and obesity [7], and rs1800629 has been associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Associations between polymorphism (rs1799964, rs1799724, rs1800630) and immune\u2010mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) have been reported [14, 15]. Limited reports are available showing that variants (rs1800629 and rs361525) are involved in the regulation of cytokine production [16]. The rs1799964 polymorphism has been associated with extra intestinal manifestations of CD including uveitis, erythema nodosum and large joint arthropathy [17] and Crohn\u2019s disease itself [16]. It is clear that TNF enhancer polymorphism is implicated in several case\u2013control studies. In the present review, the literature regarding the role of TNF\u2010\u03b1 polymorphism has been studied with respect to different human diseases and different populations. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TFBS of different TFs have been predicted computationally. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of what is currently known about the role of gene level polymorphism of TNF and susceptibility/resistance to human diseases and to highlight directions that are likely to see major advances.",

Approximately one\u2010third of the world\u2019s population is suffering from Mycobacterial diseases [18, 19]. Pulmonary tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis, is a granulomatous disease of the lungs. The host genetic factor plays a significant role in determining susceptibility to developing the active form of the disease [20, 21]. A number of genes have been identified, which are important in tuberculosis [22, 23, 24]. Elevated serum tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (sTNF\u2010\u03b1) levels have been reported in patients with advanced tuberculosis in comparison with those with mild tuberculosis and healthy controls. Several polymorphisms within the promoter region of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and the intron 1 of LT\u2010\u03b1 have been associated with altered circulating levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 [25, 26]. Some of these polymorphisms have been determine susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis in several ethnic groups [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Sharma et al. [34] carried out a case\u2013control study, including patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and controls in North India. In this study, five promoter SNPs in TNF\u2010\u03b1 gene and one SNP rs909253 in LT\u03b1 gene were detected in patients with tuberculosis and controls samples collected from North India (Fig. 2). No significant differences in allele frequencies between the patients with tuberculosis and controls were reported. Serum TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels showed a significant difference between patients with tuberculosis and controls, and none of the polymorphism affects the serum TNF levels. Ates et al. [27] reported that IL10 and TNF promoter polymorphisms have been associated with altered levels of circulating IL10 and TNF\u2010\u03b1. A significant association was reported between TB and rs1800896 G\u2010allele. IL10 GCC and ACC haplotypes distribution showed a significant difference between patients with TB and controls.

Leprosy is a mycobacterial disease, caused by Mycobacterium leprae that initially affects the peripheral nervous system and patients displaying contrasting clinical, immunological and pathological manifestations. Many factors and metabolic pathways including TLR/LIR\u20107, VDR, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 have been reported to play role in disease. Goulart and Goulart [35] reviewed the complex molecular interactions in affected individuals influenced by the pathogenetic background. A significant association between the TNF rs1800629 A\u2010allele and multibacillary leprosy has been reported from India [36]. In Brazil, this allele was associated with resistance against multibacillary leprosy [37, 38]. A significant association of TNF rs1800629 was found in borderline tuberculoid leprosy patients with the magnitude of in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity skin test reactivity to cutaneously injected M. leprae antigens. It has been reported that signalling deficient mutations in certain Toll\u2010like receptors (TLR2; act upstream of TNF) can be strongly correlated with lepromatous leprosy. TNF rs1800629 regulatory polymorphism plays an important role in patients with leprosy in a Brazilian population [39], and in patients with leprosy, higher frequency of TNF rs1800629, GG genotype, and a decreased frequency of GA/AA genotypes were reported as compared to the control group. The GG genotype was particularly higher in patients with tuberculoid (TT) and borderline (BB) leprosy. A lower frequency of GCC/GCC haplotype of IL\u201010 in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) than in controls was also reported. TNF\u2010alpha polymorphism rs361525 and rs1800629, and its association with the outcome of different clinical forms of leprosy have been reported by Vanderborght et al. [39]. TNF polymorphism rs361525 and rs1800629 have shown differences in the frequency of the haplotypes along the ethnic groups, but no statistical differences were observed in haplotype frequencies between patients with multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB).

[43] found a lower level of TNF\u2010\u03b1 in the patients with acute phase of typhoid fever than in convalescence. The seven polymorphisms have been found within the genes BAT1 (a member of the DEAD\u2010box protein family encoding an ATP\u2010dependent RNA helicase and a negative regulator of inflammation), LTA and TNF. All three genes, or haplotypes spanning these genes, have been associated with a variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Dunstan et al.

Fifteen SNPs which tagged the 42 constructed haplotypes were selected. The haplotype\u2010tagging SNPs (T1\u2013T15) were genotyped, and allelic frequencies of seven SNPs (T1, T2, T3, T5, T6, T7 and T8) have shown a significant difference between typhoid cases and controls.

We concluded that low\u2010level TNF provides host defence, whereas high TNF level has been associated with severe manifestations. Alterations in the circulating levels of TNF might be a reason for differential association with diseases in different populations and also affect the expression divergence, fitness and evolution.",
