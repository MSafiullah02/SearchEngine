The two typical word selection strategies for ED have involved: (i) the entity mention strategy: selecting the words that correspond to the entity mentions and the surrounding words in the sentences [16] (e.g., the entity mention words \u201cShe\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201cfriend\u201d, \u201cshe\u201d, and \u201ccompany\u201d in S2), and (ii) the dependency strategy: selecting the words connected to the trigger words in the dependency parse trees of the sentences [27, 30, 31].",

Such predetermined selection rules are brittle as they cannot identify the important context words for ED in all the possible sentences for event mentions. For instance, the entity mention rule would not be able to select the import words \u201cfor\u201d, \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201cjob\u201d in S2 as these words are not parts of any entity mentions (assuming the entity mentions defined in ACE 2005). Similarly, the dependency rule would be incapable of directly taking the important words \u201cgo\u201d and \u201chome\u201d in S3 as they are far apart from \u201cleave\u201d in the dependency tree of S3. It would be desirable if the context word selection strategies can be customized for each input sentence and its event trigger candidate so the most effective context words for each trigger candidate can be revealed and modeled.",

            "text": "Consequently, instead of using the fixed rules, in this work, we propose a novel method for ED that learns to select important context words to perform event prediction for trigger word candidates in the sentences based on deep learning. For an input sentence, we propose to model the word selection process as a sequence of word selection steps that starts with the trigger word candidate of interest. At each step, the next important word for the event prediction would be chosen from the sentence, conditioned on the words that have been previously selected. Such selected words would be composed in the end to produce the feature representation for our ED problem. In particular, along the word selection sequence, a representation vector is maintained to encode the information for the words chosen up to the current step. The representation vector is first set to the representation of the trigger word candidate obtained from an LSTM model. At each step, the current representation vector is used as the query to compute a relevance/importance score for each of the non-selected words and the word with the highest relevance score would be chosen to incorporate into the current representation vector via a composition function. After some selection steps, the final representation vector would be utilized as the features to make prediction for ED. In this way, the model is trained to automatically identify important words in a given input sentence for ED, potentially leading to better relevant word choices to improve ED performance.",

We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets for ED (i.e., the ACE 2005 and TAC 2015 datasets) with different settings (i.e., the general setting and the cross-domain setting).

The most important observation from the table is that the proposed model LearnToSelectED significantly outperforms all the compared methods in this work. In particular, although LearnToSelect is only trained on the ACE 2005 training dataset, is also better than the other methods that utilize additional data for training (i.e., DM-CNN+, FrameNet and MultiAtt) (an improvement of 2.8% over the best data-augmented method MultiAtt [14]). Comparing LearnToSelectED with the other methods that explicitly select the relevant context words for ED via fixed strategies (e.g., NCNN, SupervisedAtt, GCNN-ENT), we see that LearnToSelectED has significantly better performance (an improvement of 2.1% absolute F1 score over the best model GCNN-ENT of this type). This testifies to the effectiveness of the automatic identification of important context words for ED in this work. Finally, LearnToSelectED is significantly better than the soft attention models (i.e., SupervisedAtt, MultiAtt, HBT, and Transformer), demonstrating the advantage of the hard attention mechanism in this work over the soft attention for ED.",

We write LearnToSelectED = LSTM-Compose + LearnSelection to summarize the main components in LearnToSelectED. This section aims to demonstrate the importance of these two components for LearnToSelectED in this work. In particular, we try different variations of these two components to see how well they compare with LearnToSelectED. For the LSTM-Compose component, an alternative, called RNN-Compose is to avoid the gating mechanisms in cm and only use a simple feed-forward network to transform the concatenation of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$v^i$$\\end{document} and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$u^i_j$$\\end{document} into a new vector as in vanilla RNN units. Regarding the LearnSelection component, the possible variations include the fixed strategies to select important words for ED motivated from the previous work. Specifically, we consider the following fixed strategies for important word selection in this section: 1) All: selecting all the words in the sentences, 2) Entity: selecting the words within the entity mentions of the sentences, motivated by [16], 3) Syntax: selecting the words surrounding the anchor words in the dependency trees, motivated by [27], 4) Entity-Syntax: selecting the words in the unions of those for Entity and Syntax [27], and 5) Window: selecting the adjacent words in a window of size win of the anchor words. The best value of win we find via the ACE 2005 development dataset for this variation is \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$win=5$$\\end{document}. Note that once a set of words is selected according to one of those five strategies, we perform the composition function cm over these words from left to right, keeping their natural order in the sentences. The anchor words are always used to initialize the process. Table 3 presents the performance of LearnToSelectED on the ACE 2005 development dataset when its components are replaced by the variations.\n",

Recently, a greater attention has been put on deep learning where various networks are proposed to solve ED. The typical network components include CNN [1, 2, 23, 25], RNN [22, 28], attention mechanisms [14, 16, 20], syntactic structures [27, 31], Generative Adversarial Networks [9] and document-level representation [3].
