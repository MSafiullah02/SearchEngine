Guidelines published by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference have defined pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) with stratification into mild, moderate, and severe [8]. When applied to HCT patients, those who met severe PARDS criteria remained in the intensive care unit (ICU) longer, had longer courses of mechanical ventilation and were more likely to die compared with non-HCT patients [7]. Immunodeficiency has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of and mortality from PARDS and the kinetics of white blood cell recovery may impact morbidity and mortality following HCT [9\u201315]. Children and families undergoing HCT may benefit from ongoing discussions regarding prognosis and goals of care. We hypothesized that among children with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) following HCT, those who had not recovered neutrophils at the time of IMV would have worse outcomes than those who had recovered neutrophils at the time of IMV. We further hypothesized that the presence of a respiratory pathogen would affect clinical outcome. The objective of this study was to identify whether neutrophil recovery should be considered an important variable to add to hypoxemia metrics in stratifying risk of mortality in future studies of invasively ventilated children.",

The final model contained only the neutrophil engraftment status; all other factors were eliminated during stepwise model building. Time to neutrophil recovery was analyzed using the Fine and Gray model. Follow-up time for this analysis started on the date of transplant and ended at either the date of death prior to engraftment (competing risk) or the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC > 500 cells per microliter (neutrophil recovery). Patients who never achieved neutrophil recovery were classified as having graft failure (competing risk) at day 42 post transplant. Model assumptions were verified graphically.

Age was not associated with ICU survival (p = 0.1). Results of our Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that survival was significantly different according to neutrophil recovery status (p < 0.0001). Patients who recovered neutrophils at any time during their ICU course had better survival than patients who never recovered neutrophils. Patients who had already achieved neutrophil recovery at the time of IMV fared worse than patients who recovered on the ventilator. Stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression modeling did not identify any additional host, graft, or disease-related predictors of death. Therefore, model results largely echoed results of the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis (Table 2). The greatest reduction in risk of death (relative to not recovering neutrophils) was observed in patients who achieved neutrophil recovery while on IMV (HR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.32, p < 0.0001) followed by patients who had recovered neutrophils at the time of IMV (HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.59, p < 0.0001). Direct comparison of the two groups of patients who recovered neutrophils was also statistically significant (P = 0.02) and showed a higher risk of death in those who had achieved neutrophil recovery prior to institution of IMV compared with those who achieved neutrophil recovery after IMV (HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.13, 4.57).",

Our findings suggest that critically ill pediatric HCT patients who require IMV can be supported through neutrophil recovery. Indeed, 61.5% of children without neutrophil recovery at the time of intubation who subsequently achieved recovery also achieved ICU survival. This finding offers important management insight regarding children who require IMV following allo-HCT. While recovery of neutrophils did seem to worsen acuity as assessed by oxygenation failure, need for vasoactive agents and need for RRT, most of these acuity measures were temporary, returning to baseline within 1\u20132 days. In fact, more patients who achieved neutrophil recovery following IMV required RRT compared with those who achieved recovery prior. Perhaps this is secondary to the cytokine release, inflammatory state associated with neutrophil recovery leading to generalized capillary leak that improved with RRT (with fluid management or cytokine removal by RRT) [19]. Regardless, this data would further support the use of aggressive critical care interventions during this time as the increased acuity is likely short lived and could result in survival. The most common cause of respiratory failure among patients who achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was pulmonary infection; among patients who never achieved recovery, shock/cardiovascular collapse was the most common indication. These findings suggest that improved survival among patients who subsequently achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was not limited to those patients with peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome.",

            "text": "It is interesting that the children who were admitted to the ICU with neutrophil recovery had poorer survival than those who achieved neutrophil recovery while intubated. Our dataset is limited by the lack of detailed information of the transplant course and previously treated infections prior to ICU admission. However, while it is challenging to determine conclusively why this is the case, one may speculate that diseases contributing to respiratory failure may be a contributing factor. Noninfectious causes of respiratory failure such as bronchiolitis obliterans and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia tend to occur later in the transplant course, after engraftment. These noninfectious causes are challenging to diagnose, demonstrated by the fact that not one of the subjects in this study had a specific noninfectious diagnosis. Not only does the diagnosis pose a problem, but the treatment for many noninfectious pulmonary complications are nonspecific leading to poor outcome. Perhaps, children who present critically ill after neutrophil recovery, are at higher risk for these types of respiratory complications, which contributes to higher mortality. Our current study contributes to the understanding of respiratory failure among children undergoing HCT and should help guide the application of advanced technological therapies for this population. The critical care of the mechanically ventilated pediatric HCT patient is highly variable [18]. There are often strong and divergent perspectives from both specialties providing care. The high mortality rate makes the decision to institute aggressive mechanical support such as intubation, RRT, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation difficult. Our cohort would support that the lack of neutrophils at the time respiratory failure develops is not associated with increased mortality. These patients may benefit from early and aggressive critical care interventions (including RRT) particularly when there are signs of impending neutrophil recovery.",

Some have suggested that the infusion of donor or third-party granulocytes may be useful early in the prophylaxis or treatment of severe neutropenic sepsis among patients undergoing allo-HCT [20\u201325].",

At some point during the course of mechanical ventilation, failure to recover neutrophils, while not the sole prognostic sign for survival, should serve as one indication to discuss goals of care. The lack of neutrophil recovery may become even more important when it is combined with additional variables that have been prognostic for respiratory failure mortality such as OI, peak inspiratory pressure, and length of mechanical ventilation. The challenge remains timing of this conversation. This study begins the investigation to determine critical care factors associated with neutrophil recovery. Factors that suggest higher acuity, such as the need for CPR and use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation, were associated with a decreased chance of neutrophil recovery. Perhaps these factors suggest that the patient is too sick to be supported until neutrophil recovery can be achieved. However, it could also be that severe critical illness itself is delaying neutrophil recovery. The etiology is unclear but these factors should be considered in future prospective studies.",

Children who are expected to achieve neutrophil recovery following IMV may show worsening acuity that is temporary and should be considered for aggressive support measures. In addition, management teams should anticipate increased need for support in the peri-engraftment period. Among Pediatric HCT patients with the first signs of respiratory distress, a trial of noninvasive ventilation (with positive pressure) is reasonable, although intubation should not be delayed when indicated [6, 7]. Among patients with early signs of respiratory distress and suspicion of an infection, early bronchoscopy may allow for prompt and pathogen specific treatment [26]. This is particularly important, as a respiratory pathogen in this cohort did not increase mortality, it was associated with a longer length of ventilation.",
