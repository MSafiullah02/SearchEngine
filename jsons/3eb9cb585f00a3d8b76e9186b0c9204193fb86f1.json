In California, the Water Quality Control for Recycled Water, also known as the Recycled Water Policy, was adopted by the State Water Board in 2009 and amended in 2013 to include CEC monitoring recommended by its science advisory panel (Anderson et al. 2010) . The final list of recommended compounds included 489 CECs (Drewes et al. 2018) . Four CEC indicator compounds were recommended for potable reuse monitoring by the 2013 National Water Research Institute panelnamely, cotinine, meprobamate, carbamazepine, and estrone, because of the following characteristics (Crook et al. 2013 ):", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 362, "text": "(Drewes et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 912, "end": 934, "text": "(Anderson et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1015, "text": "(Drewes et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1262, "text": "(Crook et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 250, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}], "section": "Spectroscopy"}, {"text": "\u2022 Cotinine: low molecular weight that is likely charged to some degree at pH values employed in water treatment \u2022 Meprobamate: low molecular weight with a basic structure similar to alkanes and occurs abundantly and in sufficient concentrations \u2022 Carbamazepine: low molecular weight, unique structure, recalcitrant, abundant in wastewater and occurs at adequate concentrations \u2022 Estrone: natural steroidal hormone that is present at higher levels than 17\u03b2-estradiol or ethinyl estradiol Chemical constituent detection methods.

Despite considerable progress in detection methods, there are no standard methods for quantification. When interpreting (Drewes et al. 2008) . Bioanalytical tools. Through drinking water, human exposure to chemicals does not happen singly but rather occurs as a complex mixture of dissolved chemicals and particulate matter. Often chemical toxicity is nonadditive and may be synergistic or antagonistic. Scientific studies have demonstrated that combinations of chemicals that would not elicit an effect on their own can induce significant toxicity when combined (Margiotta-Casaluci et al. 2013) . Conversely, antagonistic effects between suites of chemical constituents may occur. Because of the complex nature of constituents in wastewater, in addition to potential synergistic effects of mixtures of compounds, biological assays that can rapidly and comprehensively screen water for a suite of toxicological end points may be useful.

The conclusions of the study demonstrated that while there are limitations to bioassay techniques, they are a valid tool for water quality assessment that complement chemical analyses. A recent study incorporating 36 bioassays covering 18 biological endpoints indicated that a suite of bioassays can be useful in characterizing multiple toxicological pathways relevant to human health and can guide decision-making with regard to the treatment processes (Jia et al. 2015) . The science advisory panel, which convened in 2018 to evaluate risks from CECs in water treated for reuse, recommended that estrogen receptor alpha and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor bioassays be used to respectively assess estrogenic and dioxin-like biological activities in recycled water (Drewes et al. 2018 ).

The compound must be charged before it enters the machine. GC/MS employs two methods to charge or ionize analyte, electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI). EI results in molecular fragmentation, which gives each compound its own \"fingerprint\" and allows for individual detection; however, sensitivity is lost. CI involves ionization of a gas and results in less fragmentation than EI.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem MS\n</td><td>LC/MS differs from GC/MS in that the separation of analytes occurs in the liquid phase. LC/MS uses three ionization techniques: electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and atmospheric pressure photoionization. ESI is the most common technique.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Isotope dilution LC and tandem MS\n</td><td>LC/MS/MS involves solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS using ESI in positive and negative modes. </td></tr><tr><td>Urobilin (fluorescence detection) as an indicator of fecal contamination\n</td><td>Urobilin is a metabolic byproduct of heme metabolism that is excreted through human and animal feces in water. Urobilin has been shown to be a beneficial biomarker for detection of fecal contamination. Fluorescence detection of urobilin is achieved when urobilinogen-zinc, a chelation complex, is excited by blue light and exudes a green fluorescence. </td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": []}
