As people worldwide have the rug pulled out from under them as the world radically transforms -at least for the time being -we are all faced with the question of how to move forwards and how to identify our role in surviving this mess. The role of physical scientists is less obvious than that of doctors, biologists and chemists, who have a chance to directly contribute to the health of both individuals and society as a whole, as they search for cures, preventive measures or simply palliative care. Physics does, however, play a role in medical procedures. Diagnostic techniques like X-rays and MRI, as well as physical breathing devices (ventilators), all stem from advances in physics.

Many people today seem increasingly prepared to believe what they hear and read if it reinforces their existing biases, while dismissing any opposing arguments. Of course, there have been cases in which scientists have behaved in a similarly dogmatic way, but the scientific method encourages self-criticism. Compare a scientific theory with a conspiracy theory: advocates of the latter would point out that, like any good scientist, they too are sceptics and rationalists who value the importance of evidence. But at its heart, a conspiracy theory is the polar opposite of a scientific one, in that its proponents will seek to assimilate whatever evidence there is against it and interpret it in a way that confirms rather than repudiates their core idea, thus, making it unfalsifiable.",

This is a pity, especially because the spirit of science is the exact opposite of the 'nothing-but' . Rather, science embodies the 'not-that' philosophy, and it would behove us scientists to communicate this more widely and effectively. Where does the universe come from? We don't know, but it was not created by a giant turtle. What is gravity? We don't know, but it does not require angels to push planets around the sun. Science is driven by a sense of wonder. The explanations it gives of natural phenomena, which are made by placing limitations on what can be said and done, seem, to me, always more creative and magical than the 'nothing-but' view would suggest. Of course there are rules. Nothing can travel faster than light. Nothing can tell gravity apart from acceleration. And nothing can violate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The rest, as far as physics is concerned, is limited by nothing but our human imagination.",
