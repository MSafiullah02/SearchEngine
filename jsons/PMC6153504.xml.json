Genes encoding components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades etiologically linked to aHUS are THBD (thrombomodulin), DGKE (diacylglycerol kinase-epsilon), VWF (von Willebrand factor), factor XII, and PLG (plasminogen) [8\u201312].

Although complement gene mutations have been identified in some of the latter conditions, the etiology is speculative in others [1, 2, 8].",

Infants and the elderly are at greatest risk of influenza-related complications. Death may occur directly by the virus or by complicating bacterial pneumonia, especially due to S. pneumoniae. Influenza virus belongs to the genus Orthomyxovirus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza A and B viruses contain eight antisense strand RNA segments and express at least 17 proteins, among them three membrane (glyco)proteins in the lipid envelope: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and proton channel matrix protein 2 (M2) [17]. HA and NA are genetically unstable and determine fluctuations of the prevalent subtypes of influenza virus. Viral HA mediates attachment to sialic acid-containing host cell membrane receptors and entry of the viral genome into the target cells. Human influenza strains bind terminal \u03b12,6 galactose residues, which contributes to the known species tropism [17, 18]. Sialic acid-independent attachment has been postulated [19]. Viral neuraminidase cleaves \u03b1-ketosidic bonds of neuraminic acid [20]. It facilitates transfer of virus particles in the mucus layer of the respiratory tract and release of progeny virion from infected cells [17, 21]. NA inhibitors, such as oseltamivir (active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate), block the release of virions and their spread to neighboring epithelial cells [21].",

End stage renal disease (ESRD) was secondary to acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) and malignant hypertension. She started hemodialysis 10 days before transplant nephrectomy. Additional acute laboratory features were cold agglutinins (with negative direct Coombs test) and transiently reduced plasma C3 concentration. A graft biopsy 5 weeks after HUS onset revealed thrombosis of small renal arteries and glomerular capillaries. The transplant was removed 8 weeks after HUS onset, followed by swift normalization of the hematological parameters. A subsequent graft from a deceased donor (DD) was tolerated well without recurrence of HUS.",

In vitro infection of endothelial cells by influenza virus [52] can trigger apoptosis [53], a process known to stimulate platelet adhesion directly and via the exposure of extracellular matrix [54, 55]. In addition to injuring or activating vascular endothelial cells, influenza virus may directly affect platelets. A(H3N2) virus induces clumping of human and rabbit platelets in vitro, and a rapid drop of platelet counts in vivo after injection of the virus into rabbits [56]. More recent studies have confirmed the potential of influenza virus to activate platelets and generate thrombin [57, 58]. In a prospective study comparing patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe influenza A(H1N1) and bacterial pneumonia with healthy controls, influenza showed the greatest degree of platelet activation measured as the formation of platelet-monocyte aggregates and activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin on platelets [57].",

Considered an important upstream mediator of the innate immune system, complement also bridges innate and adaptive immunity and is tightly linked to the coagulation cascade [60, 61]. More than 50 known complement proteins are expressed by hepatocytes, but also by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and renal and gastrointestinal epithelial cells [62]. Complement can be activated via three recognized pathways: alternative, classical, and mannan-binding lectin pathways, all resulting in the enzymatic cleavage of C5, the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and of potent chemokines [61, 62]. It exerts both protective and potentially deleterious effects: it protects through virus neutralization via direct aggregation, opsonization, lysis, and promotion of phagocytosis involving complement receptors, and indirectly enhances T- and B-cell responses [61]. Complement also contributes to influenza-associated respiratory tissue injury, e.g., due to the generation of potent proinflammatory peptides [63, 64]. Neutralization of influenza virus in serum is mediated by the classical complement pathway via virus-reactive IgM [65]. Complement, complement receptors, and natural IgM antibodies appear to contribute to the maintenance of long-term memory of the influenza virus. However, influenza virus particles can activate complement in the absence of antibody [64].",

Seven were found to have AP component defects, including 3 patients with previous HUS episodes and a teenager with a renal allograft (Table 4). The latter patient carried a C3 gain-of-function mutation and had lost two previous kidney transplants owing to HUS recurrences; he was successfully treated with eculizumab for influenza-triggered HUS [33]. In addition, a 15-year-old girl (#13) was reported to have a suspected MCP mutation (based on the history of frequently relapsing aHUS that resolved spontaneously). The genetic workup was incomplete and showed normal C3 and C4, factor H, and factor I levels, undetectable CFH antibody, and lack of CHF mutation or CFHR1 deletion (Aysun \u00c7altik, personal communication). Interestingly, all four children with influenza B-associated HUS, published in 2017, carried one or more mutations of complement-related proteins [22, 23].

Some authors raised the question of whether the pandemic A(H1N1) strain poses an increased HUS risk [45]. This hypothesis is interesting in light of the case series by Berdal et al., who noted evidence for vigorous complement activation (and a tenfold increase in MAC levels in plasma) in patients with severe (complicated) influenza infection (none had HUS) [68].",

The detection in plasma of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP; d-dimers), but not overt disseminated intravascular coagulation is common and does not preclude the diagnosis of HUS (Table 2) [29, 32, 36, 38, 39]. Blood samples for complement protein and functional measurements must be taken before initiation of plasma or anti-complement therapy [94]. TTP is suspected in patients with MAHA with very low platelet counts and mild renal injury [5]. Interestingly, the 2 patients in this survey with bona fide TTP had a substantial rise in serum creatinine and one of them was dialyzed (Table 3). The presence of complicating pneumococcal pneumonia or sepsis should be ruled out in any case of (suspected) iHUS using blood cultures, direct Coombs test, coagulation studies, rapid antigen detection or nucleic acid-based assays, and evidence for NA activity (Fig. 3) [78, 84].\n",
