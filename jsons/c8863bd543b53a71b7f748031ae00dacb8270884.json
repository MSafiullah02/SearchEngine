The success of this technology is evident from the various microarrays that have been developed for this purpose, variation in the density of probes, and the time ranges required for assay completion. Among these, highdensity re-sequencing microarrays have demonstrated great potential for detecting bacterial, viral pathogens, and virulence markers. Resequencing microarrays use closely overlapping probe sets to determine a target organism's nucleotide sequence. Hybridization to a series of perfect matched probes provides confirmatory presence/absence information, while hybridization to mismatched probes reveals strainspecific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. This approach provides sequence information of the diagnostic regions of detected organisms that is considerably more informative over that provided from other microarray techniques.",

            "text": "High-density resequencing microarrays were developed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and so produce detailed genetic sequence reads. A resequencing microarray comprises ''probe sets'' -high-density arrangements of short highly specific oligonucleotide probes (25 and 29 used currently) where each base in a reference sequence is queried by four probes. One probe is an exact match of the reference sequence and the other three represent the same section of reference sequence with the central base position replaced by one of the possible SNP variants. In practical use, the number of probes is doubled so that for each base both the forward (sense) and reverse (antisense) directions are contained in a probe set. It is possible to completely ''resequence,'' resolve every base in the sequence of an unknown sample, the reference sequence itself or any other sequence that differs from the reference by one mismatch or fewer per 25 base pair (bp) (1) . At higher mismatch rates, a large number of bases can still be identified, but an increasing number will fail as the differences increase. This array-based format, combined with specific PCR, has proven ideal for SNP genotyping and phylogenetic analysis (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Initial work demonstrated the advantages of using a resequencing array with many short reference sequences to detect multiple bacterial and viral pathogens (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Taking full advantage of the sequential base resolution capability of resequencing microarrays, similarity searches of DNA databases have been incorporated into the analysis allowing for fine detailed discrimination of closely related pathogens and tracking mutations within the targeted pathogen even with only partial base call resolution in a reference sequence (8, (10) (11) (12) .",

The overall design for the resequencing microarray and selection of primers for amplification must occur first. This consists of several tasks: First, selection of organisms and desired level of discrimination for each organism and whether specific nucleic acid markers must be tested for; second, determination from known sequence data of sequence regions to choose reference sequences from; third, selection of reference sequences and check for possible conflicts; fourth, primer selection. The order of several of these steps can be interchanged and refinements consist of repeating several of these steps after making changes. Once fabricated, an amplification method is required in order to achieve the sensitivity required for diagnosis/surveillance applications, so that any of the target pathogens can be detected directly from collected samples. Finally, because so many potential organism detection events are to be dealt with, a standardized algorithm is applied to determine if pathogens are detected and report the maximum level of detail possible using the resolved base sequence information from the multiple-pathogen resequencing microarrays.",

The targets for both HAdVs and influenza are both long enough that RPM v.1 not only allows identification but also produce strain-specific sequence data at the same time. The remaining respiratory pathogens only required detection, so fewer and shorter partial sequences were selected allowing resequencing of 29.7 kb of sequences to provide at least species level identification of 26 distinct organisms (10) (Note 8).",

Overall, the detection and discrimination performance of such sequences was good. In fact, probes that for a spotted array would only discern to a particular level such as serotype will at least give the same level of discrimination on a resequencing array and often provide more detailed discrimination such as strain differentiation. Using these selection rules can however lead to wasted space on the resequencing microarray because in some cases where two probes were required on a spotted microarray, the information from only one is sufficient to provide equivalent or greater detection and discrimination on a resequencing microarray. Design methods have since been refined to reduce redundancy and better incorporate the advantages of resequencing arrays into probe selection.

From our work we have established a gross predictor that hybridization will occur for an organism on the array and that at least 70% of the bases match between the sequence used on the microarray and the organism when aligned (BLAST) (12) . A list of sequences that may potentially hybridize to the reference sequence is constructed using a BLAST query. Primers are selected from consensus sequences of wellconserved regions flanking the reference sequence from the list. All potential primers that are 18-24 bases in length with $50% GC content, with no repetitive sequences and have annealing temperature range from 55 to 60\u00b0C without potential for self annealing and hairpin formation are considered. This list is further filtered to ensure uniqueness with respect to the other pathogens and human genome by using a full search of the GenBank database with the BLAST program. This insured that the potential primers for an organism have a number of mismatches with these two groups of sequences and would not mis-prime on a sequence region not of interest in the assay (Note 10).",

Two plasmids, pSP64poly(A)-NAC1 and pSP64poly(A)-TIM, containing $500 bp of the two genes were kindly provided by Dr. Norman H. Lee at The Institute for Genome Research (Rockville, MD) (15). 1. NAC1 fragment is amplified by PCR with SP6 (5 0 -GAT TTA GGT GAC ACT ATA-3 0 and M13R (5 0 -CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3 0 ) primers, and the PCR products are purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).2. To generate RNA from pSP64poly(A)-TIM, the plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and in vitro transcribed from the SP6 promoter using the MEGAscript TM High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion). 60 fg each of NAC1 and TIM are used as internal controls for checking the amplification efficiency and the presence of inhibitors in the specimens.3.5. Multiplex RT-PCR Amplification1. Reverse transcription (RT) reactions are performed in 20 mL volumes. Mix 5-8 mL of extracted DNA with 1 mL 10 mM dNTPs (Note 15), 2 mL 40 mM primer LN, 60 fg/mL each of NAC1 and TIM, and bring the volume up to 12 mL. The reaction is incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, then chilled on ice for at least 1 min. Add 8 mL RT master mix and incubate at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 50\u00b0C for 50 min, then denature the enzyme at 85\u00b0C for 5 min.2. The RT reaction products are split up into two 10 ml volumes and used in two different multiplex PCR. Primer mix A contains 19 primer pairs and amplifies 18 gene targets from three different influenza A viruses, 1 influenza B virus, 3 serotypes of HAdVs, and one internal control (TIM;",

GeneChip 1 Resequencing Assay Kit also contains control forward 7.5 kb PCR primers (20 mM) which can replace control forward 1.0 kb PCR primers. However, the 7.5 kb IQ-EX amplification requires using Taq DNA polymerase designed for long-range PCR amplification. 2. Other transcription kits can also be used to generate RNA controls. 3. The MasterPure TM DNA and RNA purification kit gave us the highest yield of nucleic acids, but other nucleic acid extraction kits can also be used for this purpose. 4. For multiplex PCR, it is highly recommended that you test different Taq DNA polymerase. We tested several different Taq DNA polymerases from various companies; our experience suggests that Platinum Taq or GoTaq 1 Flexi DNA polymerase give the highest amplification yield. 5. Good laboratory practice, e.g., always use filtered pipette tips, clear gloves, and UV irradiate PCR hood after each PCR set up, is necessary to prevent contamination issue in the PCR. Additionally, 50x dNTPs (ACGU) and uracil-DNA glycosylase are used to prevent trace amount of carry-over contamination from the previous PCR. 6. Other PCR purification kit can also be used for cleaning up PCR products. 7. The fragmentation reagent is an equivalent of DNase I. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and biotinylated ddNTP from other sources can also be used for labeling reaction. 8. The resequencing microarray platform is generally more flexible at target selection. However, the design process can still be very complicated. Fortunately, the RPM v.1 chips are available through Tessarae Inc. (Potomac Falls, VA) with the permission from US Naval Research Laboratory. Newer version of RPM (RPM v.3.x) can be also obtained through Tessarae, Inc. (Potomac Falls, VA) with complete protocol. So initial use of the assay does not require design of a microarray. 9. The details of how to make Affymetrix CustomSeq resequencing microarray is described in GeneChip 1 CustomSeq Custom Resequencing Array Design Guide (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/other/customseq_design_manual.pdf). Briefly, the first step is to identify and generate the base sequences of interest in FASTA format. Once the content of the array has been selected, the total number of bases is calculated and an array format (different formats have different sequence capacities) is chosen. The sequence submission documents can then be prepared from this information (design request form, sequence and instruction files and purchase order)",
