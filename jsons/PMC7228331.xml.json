As the virus is spread by travelers, the number of cases and death occurrence has increased in other territories like South Korea, Iran, and Italy. In this last country the death toll up to date reaches the 6.2%, this number is still far from statistics of other related human coronavirus epidemics, like SARS (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%).\n13\n Until now, there is no enough evidence to relate specific mutation in the viral genome to a higher number of infected patients or even death, the main number of fatalities is still related to the elderly population.",

This information contributes to monitoring the spread of the infection and the surveillance for eventual recombination or genome mutations that the diversity of host, countries, weather conditions and other selective pressures that this new coronavirus could face. The globalization, increment of worldwide travelers and the high contagious rate of this virus require severe control measures to control infection dissemination.",
