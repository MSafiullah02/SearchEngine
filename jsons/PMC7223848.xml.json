We compared outcomes in revision or conversion metabolic and bariatric surgery performed with conventional laparoscopic or robotic-assisted techniques. The MBSAQIP accredits bariatric surgical facilities in the United States, who are then required to report bariatric surgical outcomes to the MBSAQIP PUF. The MBSAQIP PUF serves as a file registry that contains prospective, risk-adjusted data based on preoperative, intraoperative, and post-operative variables specific to bariatric surgery. Data is collected by trained Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (MBS) Clinical Reviewers at each bariatric center and audited similar by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). De-identified data is reported on patient characteristics, operative details, and intraoperative and perioperative outcomes. As our study utilized deidentified data from a national clinical database, neither institutional review board (IRB) approval nor consent was required.",

This is a challenging cohort. In a recent systematic review of re-operative bariatric surgery, mortality was estimated to be 2%, which is significantly higher than the 0.1\u20131.1% reported for primary bariatric procedures [2]. In a case-matched analysis comparing primary and revisional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), the revisional cohort was found to have significantly longer length of stay (3.8 vs. 2.4, p = 0.02), conversion to laparotomy (10.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.01), and 30-day morbidity (27% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.02) [3]. A meta-analysis comparing bariatric reoperations after adjustable gastric banding (ABG) found that conversion to sleeve gastrectomy had the lowest long-term complication rates (2.6%), while conversion to RYGB had the highest short-term and long-term complication rate at 10.7% and 22.0%, respectively [4]. The current literature suggests that revisional bariatric surgery is associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity and outcomes may be related to the primary and re-operative operation performed. However, there have been limited studies evaluating outcomes in revisional bariatric surgery comparing conventional laparoscopic- and robotic-assisted surgical approaches [5, 16, 17]. This study represents the largest case\u2013controlled retrospective review of the MBSAQIP PUF database comparing perioperative outcomes in laparoscopic- and robotic-assisted revisional/conversional bariatric surgery.",

This is in contrast with other studies. Buchs et al. performed a comparison of 60 consecutive revisional bariatric procedures performed laparoscopically, open, or robotic-assisted [16]. They found that while operative duration was significantly longer in the robotic-assisted cohort, there were less complications and a shorter hospital stay when the robotic platform was used. In another small series (n = 32) evaluating robotic-assisted revisional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the authors concluded that their complications and peri-operative outcomes were similar to the published results on conventional laparoscopic revisional bariatric surgery [5].",

While the robotic platform was overall safe for both revisional gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cases, we also showed that while most complications were statistically similar in matched gastric bypass (robotic vs. laparoscopic) and matched sleeve gastrectomy (robotic vs. laparoscopic) cohorts, robotic revisional metabolic and bariatric surgery was associated with non-significantly higher rates of some complications. These complications rates were overall higher in the sleeve gastrectomy cohort compared to the gastric bypass cohort. Giving these findings, the robotic platform seems overall safe, but is likely less cost-effective, and value added for patient safety remains unclear for revisional metabolic and bariatric surgical procedures, and particularly for revisional sleeve gastrectomy cases.",

Second, the database does not provide the details about the initial bariatric operation performed for cases designated as revision/conversion. As the primary bariatric operation may impact the level of difficulty of a revision/conversion bariatric procedure, the lack of detail about the initial bariatric operation performed is a possible confounding variable our study could not account for. Third, the dataset does not provide details about anastomotic techniques and surgeon experience, which are variables previously shown to impact outcomes following metabolic and bariatric surgery [23, 24]. The level of surgeon experience is not accounted for in this database, including where surgeons are on the laparoscopic or robotic learning curve. It is also unclear if anastomotic techniques varied by surgical approach. For instance, were more robotic anastomosis hand-sewn and laparoscopic stapled? It is also unclear what primary bariatric procedures were converted to what revisional procedures. Were more difficult conversion cases performed using the robotic platform versus conventional laparoscopy. These nuances could not be illicit from the MBSAQIP database, and may be confounding variables not accounted for in our study. Lastly, this is a retrospective analysis and is therefore susceptible to biases associated with retrospective analyses of clinical databases.",

It has been shown that prolonged operative duration is associated with increased complications. In a recent meta-analysis, the authors found that the likelihood of complications approximately doubles with operative time thresholds exceeding 2 [25]. Moreover, peri-operative complications [26], hospital length of stay [27, 28], 30-day adverse outcomes, such as reoperation, readmission, and intervention [29] have all been reported to be associated with increased costs. Therefore, outcome measures that were higher in the robotic-assisted gastric bypass (operative duration, aggregate bleeding and aggregate leak) and robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy cohorts (operative duration and rates of conversion, 30-day reoperation, 30-day readmission, 30-day intervention, anticoagulation for presumed or confirmed VTE, transfusion requirement, organ space SSI, aggregate leak, aggregate venous thromboembolism and aggregate SSI), can serve as proxies for higher cost associated with robotic-assisted metabolic and bariatric surgery. While revisional cases have been reported to be a safe and effective way to treat patients who have significant weight recidivism and relapse of comorbid conditions post-bariatric surgery [6, 7, 18, 19], there are no clear patient benefits to utilizing robotic assistance for these cases. Because of the large initial investment, consumables, annual maintenance, and other reusable equipment also associated with the robotic platforms [30, 31], health systems must be cognizant of the fact that some peri-operative outcomes may favor the use of conventional laparoscopy over the robotic-assisted approach for revisional bariatric procedures. These differences can contribute to higher healthcare expenditures with little effect on patient safety outcomes when the robotic platform is utilized in this patient cohort.",
