            "text": "One key tenet of our work has been to focus on eliminating the barriers that prevent patients from accessing care. As providers, we have the responsibility to cross the distance that separates those who need help from our expertise. Outreaches have been key in reaching the marginalized in rural and urban settings. These efforts bring care to those who would otherwise avoid it or be unable to access it. We organize outreach programs strategically in smaller regional towns and coordinate transportation for patients from even more remote areas. Substantial barriers do remain for these people and their families, but providing diagnoses and treatment closer to their homes is essential to care for the most disenfranchised. In this way we can impact thousands of people otherwise cut off from modern ophthalmology.",

For many patients, where and how to get treatment is now uncertain. This creates analogous barriers to access, making \u201coutreach\u201d efforts important here as well. Video visits and phone calls can act as technologically driven outreaches, eliminating logistics that are particularly difficult at this time. Our experience also suggests that maintaining a presence in less populated areas and in satellite clinics is important. While many people can access virtual portals, not everyone can. Targeting isolated populations is crucial and may involve a rotation of clinics that remain open. As jobless rates soar, lack of insurance and other financial pressures will confront patients with agonizing decisions. The solutions we develop for this pandemic have to ensure that while eye care is appropriately scaled back, it is evenly and equitably available.",

In Ethiopia, there are approximately 2 ophthalmologists for every million people, with a corresponding lack of subspecialists, ophthalmic nurses, and optometrists. This mismatch of patients and providers has created huge backlogs of blindness. Ophthalmologists and their teams by necessity have created systems to help alleviate this scarcity. The Aravind Eye Hospital network in India is renowned for expanding the scope of practice for its mid-level ophthalmic personnel, thereby supplying quality care to a greater number of people.1 Fellowship-trained specialists in developing regions continue to provide comprehensive ophthalmic services to their patients in addition to complex subspecialty interventions. The underlying principle is that every team member ought to work to their highest potential, relying on the full breadth of their training.",

Lower clinic volumes create opportunities to train staff on new protocols, machines, and work flows so that individuals have broader skill sets. As ophthalmologists during this remarkable time, we ought to use the full breadth of our training to care for patients with diverse pathologies. By providing comprehensive care to those we see, we can limit personnel, visits, and viral transmission. Systems that successfully overcome a scarcity of expertise maximize the individuals who are available.

These constraints have inspired critical appraisals of how resources are used, which are then followed by innovative changes. Surgical gloves provide an illustrative example. Given scarcity, protocols have been developed to use isopropyl alcohol or chlorhexidine to clean gloves multiple times rather than replacing after each case. The safety of such changes must be validated, and the data show no increase in infection rates.2\n,\n3 Beyond particular shortages, a mindset of avoiding single-use resources and minimizing waste is common in the global ophthalmology community. Reducing the clinical footprint without compromising quality or safety has allowed physicians to treat more patients while working within the scarcity of the system.",

The number of patients overwhelms the capacity, meaning that deciding who receives treatment cannot simply be a question of diagnosis. Determining how to allocate care is agonizing but necessary. Though undoubtedly \u201cvisually significant,\u201d a 20/200 cataract may not reach the threshold for intervention at a surgical outreach. Plentiful cataracts causing hand motion or count fingers vision are appropriately given priority. We are not comfortable with this reality and are working to expand the quality and availability of services. Nevertheless, explicitly deciding how to distribute a scarce resource recognizes a reality and maximizes the effect of our interventions.",

The infectious risk inherent in any interaction has to be outweighed by its benefit. Accordingly, the threshold for treating\u2014or even seeing\u2014a patient has changed abruptly. This recalibration should ensure that care remains available for those with the greatest need, though it necessarily involves delaying care for others. In such unique circumstances, it is critical to explicitly and equitably determine which services are offered or postponed. Making such choices is difficult in the moment and on an individual basis. Instead, these decisions are most effective when they are made beforehand and rely on objective measures. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and individual societies have offered guidance on what may qualify as urgent or emergent,4 but individual providers and practices are left to decide. Surgical decisions implicate our medicine and anesthesia colleagues and are therefore particularly crucial. Only justifiable, objective determinations of which cases continue will maintain trust and preserve our ability to treat those who urgently need our expertise. The broader context of this pandemic demands consistency from the ophthalmology community. In this way, we can maximize our possible impact.",

That would lead us to focus on ourselves, to the exclusion of others who need our help. Or it would tempt us to ignore how our actions fit within the larger system and either support or erode healthcare more broadly in this extraordinary time.
