However, the French sociologist himself understood language in the context of civil society-building. To Durkheim, language was a \"social thing in the highest degree\" that enabled general ideas and intermediated them to people. Abstract human ideals like the civil religion since the French Revolution could be shared through (a common) language. Thus, Durkheim took the exclusive use of French in the Third Republic's laic public education for granted, ignoring the patois in the country: This \"child of the Enlightenment\" considered French to be a universal language of Gesellschaft and, beyond ethno-communal elements, to work as a basis for the organic solidarity of French national civil society where the social division of labor was progressing. Durkheim's theory was predicated on civil-linguistic, not ethnolinguistic, nationalism.",

Thomas Luckmann, a phenomenological sociologist of knowledge who led the \"linguistic turn\" in sociology in the mid-1960s, wrote in his 1975 Sociology of Language, looking back to the early 1960s before the turn, \"At that time the sociology of language did not yet exist\" (Luckmann 1975: 5) ; that is, the sociology of language had grown into a \"new field\" over only approximately ten years (Luckmann 1975: 5) . Nevertheless, he first named Durkheim as a source for the sociology of language (Luckmann 1975: 13-14, 19) . Indeed, it seems that this French sociologist had the most awareness of the social significance of language among the fathers of today's sociology. Georg Simmel and Max Weber dealt with language rather peripherally, although they would have been surrounded by a social organicism linked with ethnolinguistic nationalism in Germany, as well as by the tradition of the philosophy of language that went back to Wilhelm von Humboldt (see Knoblauch 2003: 582) .",

However, language seems to have mattered to Durkheim within a peculiarly French background. To begin with, he was one of the promising young scholars sent to Germany by the Third Republic to learn from the victors of the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War (Tiryakian 1978, p. 193-194) . Partly for this reason, Durkheim shared the Republic's recognition of issues: For instance, the Republic had attributed its defeat to a lack of national awareness and thus had erected a primary-education system that would promote a strong French national identity (Nakamoto 2008, p. 34 ; see also Baub\u00e9rot [2000 Baub\u00e9rot [ ] 2008 ); Durkheim's sociology was also directed toward creating \"good Frenchmen\" and moral unity among them.",

            "text": "Nor is his sociology of language an exception; in fact, language seems to underlie his whole social theory. However, despite his awareness of language's importance, he never intensively developed linguistic sociology. Hence, in the following discussion, I will reconstruct his view of language from his fragmentary descriptions about language. 1 First, I articulate the theoretical position of language for Durkheim. Less famously, he characterized language as a social thing in the highest degree, a fundamental social fact that enables ideal systems like religion, morality, laws, economy, and aesthetics and intermediates them to people. Second, I will show that Durkheim assumes the linguistic unity of France to be indispensable for social (and national) integration; French makes it possible for French citizens to share civil religion, a system of ideals, that Durkheim called moral individualism and that leads to organic solidarity despite the social division of labor. Third, I will also indicate that, as a prerequisite to sharing civil morality, Durkheim suggested the exclusive use of French in laic school education, although France in those days was a multilingual country. In his view, those who shared the Revolution's modern human ideals beyond lifeworldly ethno-communal elements were free and equal members of French civil, yet national, society and, therefore, had to share the French language as a universal medium beyond patois. As I suggest above, one could name this view civil-linguistic nationalism to distinguish it from ethnolinguistic nationalism that, as seen in Germany, identifies the nation with a community in which the people ethnically share a language (and the Volksgeist based on it).",

Durkheim's view on language seems to have been closely associated with this national goal, underlying his sociology of education and that of religion, and it would therefore have to receive special attention. On the other hand, from a sociological perspective, it should not be overlooked that the self-identification of French national society as a \"community of citizens\" can, in this globalized era, lead to or be abused for exclusionism. In the conclusion, I will refer to this actual, paradoxical phenomenon of French modern human ideals instilled through a laic education-but similar phenomena may more or less be found in other national societies today.",

In fact, he himself described French society as a \"communion of minds (communion des esprits)\" (Durkheim [1898 (Durkheim [ ] 1987b (Durkheim [ , p. 272 = 1973b , whose members were associated through respect for the abstract individual. Durkheim's view of language must also be grasped in this context: He attended to society-building (Gesellschaftsbildung, Vergesellschaftung; societization or sociation) by citizens who shared modern human ideals and spoke French, the \"common language of citizens for free communication\" (see R. Balibar 1991, p. 74) above the vernaculars of lifeworldly communities.",

It is, however, no different for judgments of reality, because concepts are equally constructions of the mind, and accordingly ideals; and it would not be difficult to demonstrate that they [concepts] are even collective ideals, since they can be formed only in and through language, which, at the highest level, is a collective thing.

In other words, the common language has to be a \"non-contractual element in contract\" in society, because it enables individuals to make civil or social contracts. Practically, too, the sharing of a common language would be necessary for people, despite their diversity, to contract the exchange of expertise in the social division of labor.

As has been shown, Durkheim himself espoused the ideals of freedom and equality embodied in the French Revolution and its inheritor, the Third Republic of France, in which he lived (see Tiryakian 1978) . Despite having been born a Jewish rabbi's son, he was a \"true child of the Enlightenment\" (Hughes 1958, p. 280 ) and the \"highest priest and theologian of the civil religion of the Third Republic\" (Bellah 1973, p. x). 4 In this regard, Durkheim was a modern liberal individualist, contrary to the usual understanding of him as a collectivist (see also Fournier 2007 Fournier , p. 16 = 2013 . He originally chose collectivism to advocate for individualism. In his opinion, beliefs (i.e., conceptual thoughts or ideals) are only active when they are shared (Durkheim 1912 (Durkheim , p. 607 = [1915 (Durkheim ] 1964 . Society, he remarks, \"can last only on the condition that there exist sufficient similarities between all its members, that is to say, on the condition that they all reproduce, in differing degree, the essential characteristics of the same ideal which is the collective ideal\" (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ , p. 97 = [1961 ). Moral individualism must accordingly be collective to be real; in this sense, society realizes modern free individuals. \"[F]reedom became a reality only in and through society\" (Durkheim [ ] 1951c (Durkheim [ , p. 79 = 1965 . Society and the individual are not always antagonists. Rather, society underlies the religion of humanity that liberates individuals from an old order. \"Collective life is not born from individual life, but it is, on the contrary, the second which is born from the first.",

Because of this methodological nationalism, there was virtually no distinction between modern human ideals and national ideals for him: Moral individualism is \"the only belief system that can ensure the moral unity of this country [France],\" and \"if there is a country among all others where the cause of [moral] individualism is truly national, it is our own\" (Durkheim [1898 (Durkheim [ ] 1987b (Durkheim [ , pp. 270, 274 = 1973b .",

Important here is that society could contain a linguistic diversity at least at the beginning, because it is not always the grown form of one linguistically homogeneous community. Rather, society (Gesellschaft) would usually come into existence through a cross-cultural linkage of communities (Gemeinschaften), which would respectively have their own vernacular and Volksgeist. Therefore, to presume the linguistic homogeneity of society to be a natural given is na\u00efve. Durkheim's French society achieved linguistic unity by artificial means like school education, and the French language thereby became the language of Gesellschaft with which society's soul is shared beyond the languages of Gemeinschaften.",

For Durkheim, the modern state was the organ of rationality that evolutionarily emerged for unifying social functions originating in the social division of labor (see Badie and Birnbaum [1979] 1982, pp. 27-37) . In this regard, the State (i.e., government) was the practical backing for moral individualism. Durkheim manifestly hoped that society would realize modern ideals with the assistance of state regulations: (Durkheim, [1950 (Durkheim, [ ] 1995 (Durkheim, [ , pp. 95-96 = 2012 Durkheim may have expected an enlightening government due to his ethnic marginality as a rabbi's son. Of course, he recognized that the State could be oppressive to the individual. The Dreyfus Affair, an anti-Semitic \"collective effervescence,\" would be an example; Durkheim resolutely advocated for Albert Dreyfus, the Jewish artillery officer from Alsace. However, this attitude derived from his civil loyalty to the national credo of modern France, not from ethnic solidarity with fellow Jews or from antipatriotic or anarchist feeling. Rather, Durkheim adhered to the French nation-state beyond origin, race, or religion as an embodiment of universal, modern human ideals. 9 He had confidence in the State because he, as 8 On this, see also Mathiez (1904) , who has described the essentially religious character of the French Revolution by using Durkheim's concept of religion. Durkheim himself shows a similar comprehension of the Revolution (Durkheim 1912 (Durkheim , pp. 305-306 = [1915 (Durkheim ] 1964 . In Durkheim's view, a secular phenomenon without mysterious content can also remain religious if it has a certain kind of form: dogma, symbols, altars, and feasts. For a brief analysis of the religiosity of secular (but nationalist-belief-related) objects, see also Durkheim (1899 Durkheim ( , pp. 19-23 = 2011 . 9 As suggested in a footnote above, Durkheim's devotion to the Third Republic's civil religion is completely consistent with his Jewish origin, since modern liberalism based on the Enlightenment (at least theoretically) resulted in emancipating members of minorities as equal individuals free from discrimination by a dominant majority group, in this case, Catholic France (and, more generally speaking, modern liberalism emancipated all the people from their own conventional religious or local communities). In this regard, Durkheim's experience in childhood of seeing anti-Semitic sentiment spread rapidly after the Franco-Prussian War could have an influence on his social theory. He notes, \"It had already been seen in the eastern regions during the war of 1870; being myself of Jewish origin, I was then able to observe it closely. It was the Jews who were blamed for defeats. Finally, an outbreak [of persecution] of the same kind [as] in 1848, but much more violent, occurred in Alsace\" (Durkheim [1899 (Durkheim [ ] 1975d (Durkheim [ , p. 252 = 2008 . In fact, the equality of Jews in the French nation remained only superficial at that time, and their \"strangerness\" in their fatherland (or, more concretely, their hometowns) would have been evident even in the eyes of a child. For details of the anti-Semitism and experiences of Durkheim's childhood, see Natsukari (1978 Natsukari ( , 1996 , Nakajima (1982) , and Fournier (2007, partie 1, ch. 1 = 2013, part 1, chap. 1). Bellah (1973, pp. xvi-xvii) characterizes, was not a conservative but a political liberal. Thus, he believed the State to liberate the individual from the tyranny of pre-modern collectivities (Durkheim [1950 (Durkheim [ ] 1995 (Durkheim [ , pp. 93-99, 103-104 = 2012 . Today, his political stance would be classified as liberal nationalism (Adachi 2013, pp. 67-90) .",

Social facts are not those which one has made alone but which one \"has received through education\" (Durkheim [1895 (Durkheim [ , pp. 3-4 = 1982 ). Durkheim's sociology of religion attracts much attention, but his sociology of education was much more theoretically important for him since religion is underpinned by education. To begin with, he perceived traditional religions to no longer function in rebuilding favorable solidarity among modern people (Durkheim 1897 (Durkheim , pp. 430-432, 440-441 = [1951 , 383). Of course, nor does education itself have such a function. It is a mere reflection of society because of its dependence on the moral condition of society (Durkheim 1897 (Durkheim , pp. 427-428 = [1951 ). However, this implies that, insofar as society is morally healthy, education can reproduce it. In this regard, Durkheim conceived school as having a comparable function with that which church once had for traditional religion. School spreads civil religion among the public and maintains it within the whole society.",

The role of the State is to bring out these essential principles, to have them taught in its schools, to ensure that nowhere is children left ignorant of them, that everywhere they would be spoken of with the respect which is due to them. (Durkheim 1922 (Durkheim , p. 62 = 1956 Historically, a republican educational system for nurturing citizens was an ardent wish of the revolutionaries. Despite several plans, the First Republic (and also the First Empire of Napoleon) had virtually given up modernizing (laicizing) primary education while nonetheless creating a prototype for an elite-education system: the secular system of secondary and higher education like \u00c9cole Centrale (or Lyc\u00e9e), Grande \u00c9cole, and Universit\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale (Tanigawa 2015, pp. 105-124) . Eventually, in 1833 during the anti-Catholic July Monarchy, the laicization of primary education was undertaken with the so-called Guizot Law, which declared that each municipal commune with over 500 population must have one public primary boy's school and each prefecture one normal boy's school (Tanigawa 2015, pp. 151-152; Baub\u00e9rot [2000] 2008, chap. 2-3). With ensuing obstacles and detours such as the Falloux Law in 1850 during the Second Republic or the intensified conflict between the so-called \"two Frances\" in the Second Empire, the 1881-1882 Ferry Laws in the Third Republic introduced the three principles of \"obligatory, free of charge, and laic\" into (public) primary education. Then, the Goblet Law in 1886 stipulated the laicity of public school teachers.",

The law in 1904 forbade monks and nuns to teach even at private schools. Laicization then culminated with Prime Minister \u00c9mile Combes's draft law for the separation of church and state, which was enacted with a slight change by Maurice Rouvier's cabinet in 1905 (Tanigawa 2015, pp. 212-237) . The law confined religion to the private sphere, while primary school teachers were expected to work as \"priests of the Republic\" and acted as such with missionary fervor (Tanigawa 2015, pp. 200-219) . 10 Durkheim thought that civil religion should fill the moral emptiness originating in laicization, and he gave the State a crucial role: \"[T]he role of the State in this respect is what it was formerly. It rests with it [the State], so to speak, to organize the cult, to preside there, and to ensure its regular functioning and development\" (Durkheim [1950 (Durkheim [ ] 1995 (Durkheim [ , p. 104 = 2012 . Thus, Durkheim regarded the state-controlled school as a kind of church of civil religion. He also insisted that no school is at liberty to educate in a way that denies the free society of modern France or harms its solidarity, even saying that public schools (\u00e9coles publiques) \"are and must be the guardians par excellence of our [French] national type\" (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ , p. 27 = [1961 (Durkheim [ ] 1973 . In Durkheim's view, state-controlled education incorporates moral individualism into French national identity, and thereby the French national society becomes a civil-social reality sui generis, which would impose sanctions upon behaviors that compromise sacred human ideals such as freedom and equality: \"[T]here is one [society] that enjoys a genuine primacy over all the others. It is the political society, the fatherland (patrie) [\u2026] .",

            "text": "However, it was Durkheim's linguistic sociology that underlay his educational sociology, which in turn underpinned his civil-religious ideal. As seen above, conceptual thinking requires language. Suggestively, Durkheim believed that unorganized thought reaches maximum intensity in children (Durkheim [1938 (Durkheim [ ] 2014 (Durkheim [ , p. 394 = [1977 2006, pp. 343-344). Although he considered conceptual thought itself to be universal and transcending cultures, Durkheim presupposed a hierarchy between children's and adults' thinking abilities: Children think less abstractly than adults and are animal-like. In this sense, \"[A] human being is only a human being to the degree that the person is civilized\" (Durkheim [ ] 1951c (Durkheim [ , p. 79 = 1965 . This difference would, along with Durkheim's theory, derive from the fact that children are neither well-learned nor well-socialized by language: Language brings a logical, 10 It would be worth noting that such a \"mission\" was not only true of primary school teachers (instituteurs). Fournier (2007 Fournier ( , pp. 15-16 = 2013 ) adequately points out that the Third Republic was in a broader sense the \"teachers' Republic\" (R\u00e9publique des professeurs), which should necessarily include Durkheim, a university teacher. Fournier says, \"\u00c9mile Durkheim commits himself [to] and multiplies public interventions. In short, he is an intellectual in the spirit of the Third Republic, this Republic of teachers, whose credo revolves around three words: democracy, secularism and science (la d\u00e9mocratie, le s\u00e9cularisme et la science)\" (Fournier 2007 (Fournier , p. 918 = 2013 . Accordingly, Bellah's above-cited characterization of Durkheim as the \"highest priest and theologian of the civil religion of the Third Republic\" should be taken literally: Durkheim, as a university teacher of sociology, aimed to provide a theoretical justification for the Republic's civil religion and thereby to support its ideals to be realized through the education system. Steven Lukes remarks, \"Durkheim believed that the relation of the science of sociology to education was that of theory to practice; and, in this respect, it would become a rational substitute for traditional religion. Teachers should be imbued with the 'sociological point of view' [\u2026] .\" (Lukes [1973 (Lukes [ ] 1975 . In fact, in 1902, Durkheim was assigned to the Science of Education at the Sorbonne as the replacement of Ferdinand Buisson, who, as Director of Primary Education at the Ministry of Public Instruction from 1879 to 1896, took a role responsible for implementing many educational reforms of the Third Republic's primary sector, including the Ferry Laws (Lukes [1973 (Lukes [ ] 1975 Fournier 2007 Fournier , pp. 501-511 = 2013 . reflexive, and self-controlled state to thought-it pulls thought out of its natural state (Durkheim [1938 (Durkheim [ ] 2014 (Durkheim [ , p. 394 = [1977 (Durkheim [ ] 2006 .

It is this attention and concentration which are the active tools of all intellectual analysis.

Just as Luther translated the Bible into German so that believers could know the doctrine themselves, the laic Republic believed that civil religion, or laic morality, had to be delivered directly to all citizens through the universal yet national language, overcoming linguistic barriers not only of Latin but also of patois; under the hegemony of the only official language, free and equal French citizens could join a public debate as well.",

Weber 1976) in the Third Republic began with defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. As mentioned before, the defeat made it urgent to establish a strong French identity. In this light, the French nation was, in contrast to the \"belated\" German nation, a \"hastened nation\" (Watanabe 1997, p. 2) created through radical assimilationism from above, whose main means was school education. \"The School had to transform into citizens the members of restricted and particular communities so as to make them participate in the universality of national citizenship\" (Schnapper 2000, p. 155) . Thus, multilingualism would have seemed to republicans as linguistic anomie, which might prevent the sharing of ideals in one indivisible nation and thereby lead to civil-moral anomie.",

If I tried to escape from this necessity, my attempt would fail miserably\" (Durkheim [1895 (Durkheim [ , p. 5 = 1982 . However, it is doubtful that such a monolingualism had been fully realized in France. Even though French monolingualism had become a binding social fact at that time, it could properly be called a national-social fact underpinned by state-controlled education. Daniel Chernilo points out that Durkheim \"tries to combine sociological and normative arguments\" and his social theory (probably unintentionally) shows \"the normative ambiguity of the nationstate's position in modernity\" (Chernilo 2007, p. 63 , emphasis in original). Durkheim's statement on French monolingualism cited above seems to be a typical example. The Third Republic's national-educational goal was that all the people become French speakers, a goal that was to be achieved through education at any cost (e.g., loss of regional languages)-an ambition that was shared by Durkheim.",

Social life can be divided, while retaining its unity, only if each of these divisions represents a function. (Durkheim 1897 (Durkheim , p. 449 = [1951 The linguistic integration through French was a premise for this occupational decentralization, since common language functions, in organicist manner, like nerves, which smoothly connects all functionally differentiated organs and, for civil solidarity (fraternity), transmits the same moral instructions (i.e., modern ideals) from the cerebrospinal system, the primary organ of social organism, to individuals. 16 Therefore, local communities with their own languages were not only unsuitable as intermediating secondary organs but also had to be overcome. The same language must be, under state control, shared by the whole nation beyond regional boundaries. By doing so, French works literally as a social fact (i.e., a non-communal fact), in building the organic solidarity of the national society consisting of citizens who believe in moral individualism. To awaken among people \"the faith in a common ideal\" (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ , p. 108 = [1961 (Durkheim [ ] 1973 , the sharing of the language of freedom is indispensable.

To illustrate, the distinction between civic and ethnic nations, an ideal-typical classification of nations being jus soli or jus sanguinis, is useful. Relevant to the discussion here is that the civic nation is conventionally represented by France and the ethnic nation by Germany (Brubaker 1992 ). Durkheim's view of language also belongs to the former jus soli nation-view: A nation is a selectable, contractual community of citizens who, regardless of their ethno-communal elements, resonate with modern human ideals and speak the language of freedom that expresses those ideals. \"French nationality was,\" Eric Hobsbawm remarks, \"French citizenship: ethnicity, history, the language or patois spoken at home, were irrelevant to the definition of 'the nation'\" (Hobsbawm 1992, p. 88) . To be precise, French was the exception among languages spoken in the country. It was a symbol of the trans-communal citizenship of a revolutionary nation. In this sense, belonging to the French linguistic community was a choice, a social a posteriori that individual citizens could and should, in theory, acquire by will (and irrespective of their mother tongues.) As Daniel Baggioni says, \"[I]n the German conception, in the beginning were language and culture, while in the French conception language is only an instrument of political and cultural, or rather 'civilizational, ' unification\" (Baggioni 1997, p. 224 ; see also Watanabe 1997, pp. 21-22) .",

            "text": "National languages are therefore almost always semi-artificial constructs and occasionally, like modern Hebrew, virtually invented. They are the opposite of what nationalist mythology supposes them to be, namely the primordial foundations of national culture and the matrices of the national mind. They are usually attempts to devise a standardized idiom out of a multiplicity of actually spoken idioms, which are thereafter downgraded to dialects, the main problem in their construction being usually, which dialect to choose as the base of the standardized and homogenized language. (Hobsbawm 1992, p. 54) Most parts of this citation are true of France, but not in the sense of ethnolinguistic nationalism, which believes a language to ethnically demarcate a nation sharing Volksgeist. Contrary to such an imagined Gemeinschaft, modern France was not so much a reality sui generis but an imagined Gesellschaft, in which the universal language demarcates the universal civic nation beyond ethno-communal elements. Speaking French was synonymous with sharing society's soul. The French nation was another kind of Sprachnation. 18 Durkheim obviously presumed the \"nationalist equation of one language = one nation = one state\" (Auer 2005, p. 8) . As Marion M. Mitchell points out, \"While retaining humanity as a god, he [Durkheim] recognized the divinity of the nation\" (Mitchell 1931, p. 106) . But Durkheim identified the French nation with free and equal French citizens who believe in moral individualism, and therefore he transferred organicist thought from the ethnic nation (Volksgeist) to the civic nation (society's soul). Then, to overcome ethno-communal differences and to form the national civil society by universal ideals, he believed that the linguistic medium for the public life had to be French. French as a social fact was ideal rather than real. 18 It might be noteworthy that, as shown typically in the epigraph cited from Renan in the beginning of this paper, French scholars of those days seem to have tended to overlook the fact that the French nation was the sort of Sprachnation which was built sometimes \"by means of coercion.\" Those who were influenced by Durkheim's linguistic view are not exceptions. For example, Meillet assumed monolingualism in a country as if it were a natural, given condition. He writes that except for \"historical accident, the borders of diverse languages tend to coincide with those of social groups which one calls nations: The absence of a unity of language is the sign of a recent nation like in Belgium or an artificially constituted one such as in [Habsburg] Austria; language is thus eminently a social fact\" (Meillet 1906, p. 1) . In contrast to this fallacy of Meillet's, which was obviously based on methodological nationalism, Mauss wisely points out in an uncompleted manuscript that nationalities (nationalit\u00e9s) create their own languages, because the language creates the nation (Mauss [2013 (Mauss [ ] 2018 . This observation by Mauss can be said to have anticipated Benedict Anderson's famous conception of the nation-state as an \"imagined community.\" However, Mauss primarily discusses nationalism with ethnolinguistic ones in mind and, therefore, fails to apply this view of linguistic nationalism to the French nation as well (although he suggests the applicability of (ethno)linguistic nationalism to patois or dialects in France). This is probably because he wrote the manuscript against the background of the many newly independent nation-states that emerged in Central and Eastern Europe (especially in the ex-empery of the Habsburg Empire) after World War I, and was thus focused on them. Furthermore, Mauss even argues in favor of reducing the number of languages so that humanity will eventually acquire a universal (international) language, or will at least use the language of a major nation, for greater mutual understanding (Mauss [2013] 2018, pp. 147-148).",

However, in 1999, when the Constitutional Council (Conseil Constitutionel) judged that ratification of the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was unconstitutional, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, then interior minister and a member of the socialist party, was also against ratification of the Charter, saying that the recognition of regional languages \"balkanizes\" the one and indivisible Republic (The sentence cited in this paper's epigraph from Charlie Hebdo also appeared during the period in which this dispute over the Charter raged). Before these incidents, the sentence \"The language of the Republic shall be French\" had been added to Article 2 of the Constitution under the socialist party's regime in 1992, just before the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by referendum. The original intention of this amendment was a cultural-differentialist resistance against English imperialism (or American neo-liberalism), 19 but such a re-Francization contained a typical French-nationalist sense of crisis in which French is losing its former universality in international society and might become a local language in the global division of labor.

In this sense, ultra-laicism like a \"tyranny of the majority,\" using de Tocqueville's (1835 vol. 2, pp. 41-42) expression, would cause a vicious circle and end up bringing the opposite of the desired effect: a divided Republic. By the standards of today's global society, such radical laicism would only be a form of particularism or tribalism in fanatical obeyance to a particular ideal. Nor should it be overlooked that the majority's \"right to difference\" in the public sphere is implicitly granted in France; to further laicize France, they must remove \"ethno-French\" veils such as the secular observation of Sunday (the traditional Christian day of rest) or Easter (the holiest Christian feast day) and the exclusive use of the French language in civil spheres like politics, administration, or the judiciary (see Nakano 1996, p. 77) . The non-laicity of these cases should be seriously considered, since today's rightists often use the majority's \"Frenchness\" as a culturaldifferentialist reason to exclude minorities from national society.",

The haunting historical lesson is that the anti-Semitic fascist regime followed the Third Republic in which Durkheim had invested so much of his faith; furthermore, it made the first official modification to the basic policy of eradicating minority languages that had been pursued since the Revolution. Responding to regionalist insistence by rightwing nationalists in the wake of the conclusion of the Armistice of June 22, 1940 with Nazi Germany, the Vichy regime allowed the teaching of dialectal languages (langues dialectales) as an optional subject at primary school (Miyajima 1998, p. 176 ; see also Miura 2000, p. 119) . This ironic phenomenon-the official recognition of the linguistic right by the fascist regime-must not be simplistically dismissed as resulting from obscurantism. Rather, it seems to be a dialectic (or viciously cyclical) product of civil nationalism and ethnic nationalism in France. An uncompromising belief in the nation, whether leftist or rightist, can always invert into the principle of exclusion and consequently produce a reaction by the excluded people.",
