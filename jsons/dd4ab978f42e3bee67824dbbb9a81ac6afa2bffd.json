In vivo imaging techniques such as radiography and nuclear medicine have the potential to decrease the number of animals used, measure real-time responses in disease progression, and accelerate therapeutic discovery studies. A combination of positron emission tomography (PET ) and computed tomography (CT ), which fuses the molecular information of radiolabeled tracers at the subcellular level of PET with the cross-sectional anatomical information of CT, would give both spatial and temporal information on a single subject, allow each subject to serve as its own internal control, and possibly reduce the number of subjects needed for statistical significance. The most common PET imaging radiotracer used in clinical and basic science research is 2-deoxy-2-( F)fluoro-D-glucose ( F-FDG ). The glycolytic rate of this analog of glucose serves as a measure of metabolic activity, which can be increased in pathophysiologic states such as malignancy, inflammation, and infection (Baum et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2009; Czernin et al. 2010; Kwee and Kwee 2009; Kwee et al. 2008; Love et al. 2009 ).

The ferret is an especially attractive model for pulmonary studies because its long trachea, large lung capacity, and bronchiolar branching facilitate radiographic analysis and histopathologic comparison. Inflammatory changes in diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis could be assessed with F-FDG and followed during treatment protocols. F-FDG could also be used to track activated leukocytes in pulmonary infections as well as any resulting inflammatory sequelae. Although F-FDG PET/CT has been studied comprehensively in other models such as the mouse (Abbey et al. 2004; Deroose et al. 2007; Rowland and Cherry 2008; Shoghi et al. 2008; Virostko and Powers 2009) , the results have not been reported in the literature of the ferret model at the time of this writing. The lack of imaging studies stands as a current impediment in basic and clinical science because clinicians commonly rely on chest radiography and CT to assess the severity of pulmonary disease and guide patient management. Certainly, the increasing use of molecular imaging methods such as PET to study the microbial pathogenesis in laboratory animals and humans can be translated to the ferret (Kalicke et al. 2000; Sathekge et al. 2010) . Challenges to using ferrets in PET/CT include (1) unique body size dimensions that may not fit traditional preclinical PET/CT hardware, (2) thoracic anatomy not previously characterized in radiologic literature, (3) potentially unusual biodistribution of molecular radiotracers, (4) scarce data comparing imaging techniques, and (5) respiratory physiology that warrants specialized handling and imaging protocols to optimize data acquisition and avoid artifacts.

After successful anesthesia and intubation, the ferrets were placed on the scanning bed. Initial CT scans were performed to identify prominent structures in normal ferret pulmonary anatomy ( Figure 1 ). In the right lung, the ferret has an upper (cranial) lobe, a middle lobe, a lower (caudal) lobe, and an accessory lobe in the Mean 1 medial lung base. In the left lung, there is an upper (cranial) and a lower (caudal) lobe (Fox 1998) . We used soft tissue windowing to identify vascular, mediastinal, and muscular structures in the ferret (Figure 2 ). Using the CT settings outlined previously, the superior vena cava, inferior cava, and aorta were readily identifiable and traceable in three projections (sagittal, coronal, and transaxial). For each ferret, we performed, coregistered, and fused PET imaging with corresponding CT scans (Figure 3 ). Areas of mildly increased F-FDG uptake were noted in the thymus, subcarinal, and paratracheal lymph nodes. Intense uptake, as expected, was in the myocardium. In the lung parenchyma, we noted no focal areas of consolidation or opacification on CT , and we identified no analogous metabolically active regions on PET. We created volumetric constructions to delineate regions of interest in PET scans (Figure 4 ). To calculate F-FDG activity, we used PMOD to create generalized ellipsoid and cuboid VOIs in the heart and thymus, respectively. We then refitted the VOIs to the structures using previously described methods (Equations 2 and 3). For the liver and the lungs, spherical VOIs were sufficient to calculate background activity. In a few cases, automatic refitting would erroneously include surrounding structures with elevated F-FDG activity, which we manually removed. We obtained average values for all ferrets included in the study (Table 1) We performed a number of technique trials to ascertain their effect on imaging quality. First, in human subjects, the uptake period for F-FDG is usually around 60 minutes for optimal signal:noise ratio. Because the ideal uptake period is unknown in ferrets, we assessed the optimal timing between radiotracer administration and initiation of PET imaging by grouping uptake phases at 60 minutes (n = 5), 90 minutes (n = 4), and > 90 minutes (average 110 minutes, n = 3) ( Figure 5 ). As previously noted, we did not perform dynamic imaging in an effort to maximize animal care outside the scanner during the uptake periods. We obtained SUV values from VOIs in the liver, heart, thymus, and bilateral lung fields as described previously. In each uptake period, the heart had the consistently highest SUV , followed by the thymus and liver. The right and left lungs had values similar to each other for all uptake durations, with intensities appropriately lower than other tissues at the 60-and 90-minute uptake periods. By >90 minutes, it was more difficult to distinguish the SUV of the lungs from the liver due to decreasing liver intensity. Because it is also unknown which administration method of F-FDG is optimal, we compared PET images acquired after intravenous (n = 6) and intraperitoneal injections (n=6) of F-FDG at an uptake period of 90 minutes ( Figure 6 ). The route of administration did not affect the ability to align and fuse the PET and CT scans. The heart was the most metabolically active in both routes, followed by the thymus and liver. Overall, the trend in both administration routes demonstrated that the right and left lungs were the least metabolically active, as expected. Regardless of method, we observed no focal areas of increased F-FDG uptake in the lung parenchyma on visual comparison. Finally, we used respiratory gating to assess differences in CT image quality (Figure 7) . Respiratory gating involves the acquisition of photon events at specific points during periods of the respiratory cycle, such as during maximal inspiration by the subject, in order to reduce motion artifact, keep specific lesions in roughly the same position, and increase overall spatial resolution. Similar to other comparisons, respiratory gating did not detract or enhance from our ability to coregister CT and PET images. In addition, we could readily fuse the images using PMOD. Visually, in the absence of lesions, there was no substantial difference in imaging features compared with ungated acquisitions. In both gated and ungated images, soft tissue structures such as the heart and liver were readily distinguishable from the lung parenchyma.

For more irregular structures such as the myocardium or thymus, an initially generic ellipsoid or rectangular prism could be adequately refitted to the target organ using appropriate thresholds (Equations 2 and 3). Of note, it is imperative for the researcher to scan through individual slices (or look on a 3D locator) to ensure that adjacent structures of similar or increased SUV values are not accidentally included in the VOI. Failure to do so could result in the erroneous inclusion of much more metabolically active structures into calculations, which could skew uptake measurements such as SUV and SUV .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The importance of measuring optimal uptake time periods cannot be overstated in planning a animal research study because different uptake periods greatly affect animal management, imaging workflow, fasting periods, and the number of subjects imaged on any given day.

Thus, it was essential to compare both routes to assess for differences in F-FDG PET/CT image production.

Perhaps due to the fact that the respiratory rate for a ferret typically ranges from 30 to 40 breaths per minute and that we used a 500-ms acquisition time, there may not have been sufficient movement during respiration to require respiratory gating.

Third, the study primarily focuses on thoracic structures with partial imaging of the upper abdomen. This thoracic emphasis was reasonable due to the ferret's long thoracic anatomy, which provides more anatomical and physiologic detail. We included portions of the liver in the reported data. We did not report splenic imaging data because the spleen is located more caudally in the ferret and therefore was outside the field of view.

As noted previously, one of the more important considerations is the fact that ferrets are permissive hosts for the influenza virus, which means that the virus does not typically have to be adapted to the animal to infect, more closely mimicking the infectious agent in humans. In the case of mice and rats, the human seasonal influenza virus requires adaptation before it can replicate in the animal and cause disease. In addition, ferrets display signs and symptoms of severe influenza infection similar to humans, which helps to assess susceptibility to the infection and pathophysiologic comparability to human hosts. In contrast, mice do not typically show outward signs of fever after infection.
