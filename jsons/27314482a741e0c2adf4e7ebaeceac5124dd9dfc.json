As shown in Figure 2A , the most common CT manifestation on admission is ground glass density enhancement along the outer bands of both lungs. Several days later, the ground glass opacity began to solidify, as shown in Figure 2B . With the development of disease, the consolidation absorbed gradually, as shown in Figure 2C and 2D. In general, the reabsorption takes much longer than consolidation. Figure 3 showed chest CT images of four patients, A/B in the SpO2\u226590% group and C/D in the SpO2<90% group.

Both of them caused frequent fever, cough, and fatigue, whereas the upper respiratory symptoms like pharyngalgia and rhinorrhea were less common [11, 12] . SARS-CoV targets human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and infects intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [13, 14] . MERS-CoV attaches to its receptor, an exopeptidase called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to infect its host [15] . It appears that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV did [16] , so the replication of SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to happen in the lower respiratory tract rather than the throat. This hypothesis may be the reason for the false negative was also reported in two other researches [5, 18] . Given SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 75%-80% gene sequence and genomic sequence was detected in the faeces of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 would infect more than just the respiratory system, which may complicate the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 [16] . to the outcomes data of two patients in the SpO2<90% group was missing, the prognosis comparation between the SpO2<90% group and the SpO2\u226590% group may be biased.

According to published data from Chinese government, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 4.1% for Wuhan and 2.0% for the whole mainland of China, which were much lower than that of SARS and MERS, indicating the limited using ofcorticosteroids was reasonable. Because of the limited sample in this work, the correlation between use of corticosteroids and death should be interpreted with caution. Currently, COVID-19 has no particularly effective treatment. The effect of antiviral therapy is still controversial [25]. Here we tried to treat COVID-19 patients with arbidol. The mechanism of arbidol, a small indole-derivative molecule, involves inhibition of virus-mediated fusion with According to the guideline for management of COVID-19 from the national health commission of China [28], two consecutive times of negative nucleic acid tests of respiratory samples are needed before discharge. And the sampling time should be at least 24 hours apart. But, some patients still showed positive RT-PCR tests with SARS-CoV-2 after discharge [29]. Therefore, apart from the two times of negative tests for discharge, additional RT-PCR tests may be needed for some patients depending on viral burden, timing during the course of infection, and the sensitivity of the assays being used. After charge, patients are strongly suggested to be quarantined for monitoring health condition for two weeks.As the size of this cohort is limited, the statistical analysis results should be interpreted with caution, and the p value without statistical significance does not necessarily reflect the exact situation of the whole population. Larger sample size of clinical studies is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of COVID-19. Moreover, due",
