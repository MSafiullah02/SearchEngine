The structure of these viruses is identical with that of the viruses of avian infectious bronchitis (BrRI~Y et al., 1964) and mouse hepatitis (TY~REIJL and ALMEIDA, 1967) . The virions are pleomorphic bodies, 80--160 m~z in diameter, and are covered with club-shaped projections 15 m~ deep which produce a characteristic fringe around the particles. All the viruses are ether-and acid-labile and, as their replication is not inhibited by BUDR, probably have an RNA genome. It has been suggested (Nature 220, 1968) that these viruses belong to a single biological group.",

Some cultures were harvested by freezing and thawing at 4 or 5 days --the fluids were subsequently stored at --20 ~ C. In experiments with the 229-E virus the fluids from each tissue culture passage were tested for infectious virus by titration in human embryo diploid lung fibroblasts (HDCS). The virus was passed in each tissue for at least 3 passages, whether there was any eytopathic effect or not. If any cytopathic effect was seen, then coverslip cultures of infected cells were prepared. These were fixed in methanol and stained with haematoxylin and eosin to permit detailed microscopic examination. After the cells had been frozen and thawed the tissue culture fluids were clarified at 50 g and then titrated in HDCS using 3.164014 (\" 89 dilutions with 3 tubes per dilution.

This species specificity was not broken by multiple passage. In certain tissues such as chick embryo kidney and PS pig kidney cells, infectious virus could be found after two 5 day passages. It was concluded that this was only virus persistence as the titre of virus fell with each passage and virus could not be recovered after 3 passages; also there was no cytopathic effect in these tissues. The virus was inoculated into suckling mice by the subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intracerebral routes but produced no disease, even on blind passage, and virus could not be recovered.

Other systems would only support virus which had been passaged in tissueculture. These results are shown in Table 2 . From this it can be seen that the 229-E virus grew in cultures of both primary embryonic lung and kidney. However, there was no cytopathic effect in the lung and only a very slow generalised one in the human embryo kidney. In both tissues virus was produced for periods of over 7 days, but only to relatively low titres (10 a TCDs0 ). We attempted to demonstrate viral interference in these tissues using ECHO virus type 11 and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) in primary HEL cells; no interference was detected. However, interference was detected in cultures of L 132 and S-3 HeLa cells. SFV was titrated in parallel in uninoculated cultures and in cultures which had been challenged 3 days previously with 229-E virus. The titre was reduced in these latter cultures by 101-s TCDs0 for L132 cells, and 102 TCD~0 for S-3 cells, below that in the control titration in previously uninoculated cells. If intervals greater than 3 days elapsed between the original inoculation and the subsequent titration, the tests were unsatisfactory because of the onset of the cytopathic effect of the 229-E virus. The 229-E virus did not diminish the ciliary activity of organ cultures of human embryo nasal, tracheal or oesophageal epithelium although it grew quite well. The virus could not be isolated in or adapted to either a line of HeLa cells, which are sensitive to rhinoviruses (CobAlT and HA~ARIAN, 1967) or to a human leukocyte line RPM17216.",

The WI38 cells showed non-specific degeneration after 2 days under the \"Bristol\" medium and therefore were not studied under this medium. Monolayers of cells in 2 oz. flat medical bottles were inoculated with an input multiplicity of approximately 0.01 TCDs0/cell. Several replicate cultures were inoculated and all bottles were incubated in a stationary position at 33 ~ C. The cytopathic effect of the virus was observed and each day 3 replicate cultures per group were frozen and thawed and blended prior to titration in HDCS lung cells. The results in Fig. 4 show that the maximum yield of virus in WI38 cells was at 3 days; after this the concentration of virus declined and the cytopathic effect increased steadily. Infected L132 and \"Bristol\" HeLa cells put out virus to as high a titre as WI38 cells and for longer periods under either maintenance medium, but the cytopathic effect under the Eagle's medium was not as marked as that seen in the WI38 cells. There was generally less production of infectious virus and less cytopathic effect in \"Bristol\" HeLa cells than in the L 132 cells. The cytopathic effect of the virus was more rapid and complete in LI32 than in HeLa cells and under \"Bristol\" medium than under Eagle's medium. The HDCS lung cells has been reported (HAM~]~, KI~DIG and M A~, 1967). When the system was investigated in this laboratory it was found that the production of plaques was rather unreliable; furthermore the method necessitates the use of large numbers of diploid cells. These L132 cells seemed at least as susceptible to the virus as HDCS so we attemped to produce plaques in monolayers of cells as they are more easily manipulated, multiply at a greater rate than HDCS, and do not die out on serial passage.",

The media were solidified by the addition of ionagar (Oxoid) to a concentration of 0.4~o.

After 6 days incubation these plaques were 2--5 mm in diameter. The plaques were quite distinct, as seen in Fig. 5 , but did not have a regular outline and were quite variable in size. The number of plaques in a test using six two-fold dilutions of virus giving between 3 and 120 plaques per It was thought that \"Bristol\" medium might be more effective than Eagle's medium because it contained rabbit rather than calf serum, so the effects of substituting various sera for the rabbit sera in the overlay medium were investigated. Two ml aliquots of virus containing approximately 500 p.f.u, were mixed with equal volumes of inactivated test sera and the mixtures left at room temperature for 2 hours. Monolayers of cells were then inoculated with samples from these mixtures and, after 3 hours incubation, were overlaid with a \"Bristol\" type agar overlay containing either 2~o of the test serum with which the virus had been reacted, or 2% rabbit serum as a reference. The mean numbers of plaques per groups of 3 plates are represented in Fig. 6 . This shows that the serum used in the original Eagle's medium (foetal calf) and the rabbit serum used in the original \"Bristol\" overlay medium resulted in the production of similar numbers of plaques ; so the sera were not directly responsible for the differences between the media. These calf sera tested showed considerable variation and one serum (calf 2) and the chicken serum produced significant (50~o) reductions in the plaque count. The plaques produced in lamb serum and ox serum were very indistinct. Rabbit sera showed considerable variation from batch to batch, therefore foetal calf serum, which gave uniform results, was used hereafter.",

A majority of these extra isolations were detected only on second or third passage using Eagle's medium. The degree of cellular destruction which these viruses produced on primary isolation was limited; occasionally the effect would reach a maximum 4--5 days after inoculation and then regress. It was found important to use the roller tube cultures before the cells had formed a complete monolayer; provided the cells remained morphologically healthy then the cytopathic effects produced by these viruses could be detected easily on blind observations. Photographs of unstained preparations showing the effects of B814 and LP viruses are shown in Fig. 9 and 10 . Fig. 8 shows unstained and uninfected L 132 cells after 4 days incubation at 33~ The majority of the cells are very flat and non-refracti]e, making them difficult to photograph. When cultures were infected with B814 virus in nasal washings a transient cytopathic effect was observed, involving a maximum of 50% of the cells after 4 to 5 days of incubation.

Two specimens of LP virus, after passage in L132 cells had produced a cytopathic effect in I-IDCS embryonic kidney cells. Fluids from these cultures then caused similar degeneration in WI38 cells and the effects were indistinguishable from those produced by 229-E virus. Furthermore, this adapted strain of LP virus would produce plaques in L132 cells using the standard \"Bristol\" overlay medium. These plaques were consistently smaller than those produced by the 229-E virus, and unlike 229-E it also produced plaques under an overlay of Eagle's medium plus 2% foetal calf serum, solidified with 0.4% Agar No. 1, and supplemented with 100 ~g/ml of DEAE-Dextran. However, the plaques were much smaller than those produced under the \"Bristol\" overlay. An attempt was made to identify virus isolates by means of a neutralization test. The tissue culture pools of each virus were titrated in L 132 cells. Approximately 50 TCDs0 of each virus were then mixed with dilutions of acute and convalescent sera from volunteers. After leaving the mixtures at room temperature for 2 hours they were inoculated into L132 roller 1 and ~ --these 2 and 4 pairs respectively reacted and 229-E viruses.

This volunteer had arrived at the Unit with a cold ; she did not develop a cold after inoculation with B 814 virus and no virus was isolated from her nasal washings.

The tissue-culture types and media used are shown inTable 1. The human leukocyte line RPMI 7216 (MOORE and GERBER, 1967) was obtained from Dr. K. FAN~ES and the PS pig kidney line (INocE and OGWA, 1962) from Dr. J. Porterfield. The antibiotics penicillin, streptomycin, and kanamyein were added, each at 100 units/ml, to the Eagle's medium, and also achromycin at 22.5 units/ml. Viruses. 229-E was obtained from Dr. D. HAMXE after limit dilution passage.
