The replicative template switch mechanism has been commonly accepted as the only possibility for generating recombinant RNAs since the work of Kirkegaard and Baltimore on homologous recombination in poliovirus [37] , which is widely cited as the most strong evidence in favor of this mechanism. They crossed the wild-type virus (guanidine sensitive and temperature resistant) with a double mutant (guanidine resistant and temperature sensitive) and looked for a recombinant progeny that was both guanidine and temperature resistant. A peculiarity of their experiment was that viruses infected the cells in two consecutive steps, so that superinfection was performed under conditions inhibiting the replication of the \u00a2rst virus, the duration of the steps being adjusted to ensure equal yields of the parental viruses by the end of the experiment. An unexpected observation was that the yield of recombinants di\u00a1ered more than 100-fold depending on which restrictive factor was applied at superinfection. Speci\u00a2cally, the number of recombinants was high when the cells were superinfected with the wild-type virus at an elevated temperature and low when the cells were superinfected with the mutant virus in the presence of guanidine. According to the authors, such an asymmetric result could not be produced by a breaking and joining mechanism inasmuch as the parental genomes were equally abundant in each case, but was a consequence of asymmetric action of the restrictive factors on RNA synthesis. By referring to unpublished data, they claimed that while an elevated temperature inhibited the synthesis of only the negative strands of the mutant virus, the synthesis of both the negative and positive strands of the wild-type virus was suppressed in the presence of guanidine.

Since the negative strands comprise only 2% of the total viral RNA [38] and are presumably involved in doublestranded replicative intermediates [5] , recombination by the breaking and joining mechanism may entirely depend on the availability of the positive strands. Yet, the positive strands synthesized at the \u00a2rst step may not be available during superinfection because of their packaging or involvement into polyribosomes. Hence, recombination by this mechanism may depend on whether the positive strands of each parental virus are synthesized during superinfection and will not occur in the presence of guanidine when synthesis of only the mutant positive strands is allowed.

In each of these cases, template switch is possible due to a particular mechanism for dissociating the nascent strand base-paired to its template: the RNA template degradation by the RNAse H activity of reverse transcriptase and the heat-induced melting of DNA duplexes during PCR.

Upon transfecting appropriate cells, the fragments did produce viable viral genomes, demonstrating that non-replicative recombination can occur in vivo.
