The prerequisite for a residue-based encoding format is a controlled vocabulary of its residue names. It makes sense to restrict the number of residues to as low as possible. The lack of clear rules to subscribe atoms of a molecule to one particular monosaccharide, and not to its substituent(s), is the main hurdle in encoding monosaccharide names. The variety in nomenclature and structural representation of glycans makes it complex to decide the best form to use. The choice of notation is frequently based on whether the study is focused on the chemistry or on biology. The information content of each representation may vary or highlight a particular aspect as compared to others. While representing a complex glycan structure, chemists prefer to elucidate the structure that includes information about the anomeric carbon, the chirality of the glycan, the monosaccharides present, and the glycosidic linkages that connect them.

Acceptor substrates are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, DNA, and numerous small molecules such as antibiotics, flavonol, steroids, etc. Glycosyl donor substrates are mostly sugar nucleotides, such as UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and GDP-Man. However, lipid-linked sugars, e.g., dolichol phosphate saccharides and unsubstituted phosphates, are also utilized. Acceptor substrates are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, DNA, antibiotic, or other small molecules. Sugar-nucleotide-dependent GTs are often referred to as Leloir enzymes. The transfer of saccharides by GTs is regiospecific and stereospecific with two possible stereochemical outcomes resulting in either inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration of the transferred sugar. Glycosyltransferases display low sequence homology, and they have recently been classified into 90 families (CAZY database: http://www.cazy.org). At the present time, more than 140 GT crystal structures are available that have been grouped in 40 families.

Three-dimensional structures have been established from X-ray crystallography as listed in http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/sacs/ (Allcorn and Martin 2002) . Carbohydrate determinants recognized by antibodies are expressed on the cell surface as glycolipids and glycoproteins. In many instances, the minimum carbohydrate epitopes are located at the terminal end of more complex carbohydrate chains, experiencing a wide range of contexts, surface densities, and surroundings. Therefore, antibodies with similar specificities for individual carbohydrate epitopes can exhibit different selective cell profiling depending upon the unique presentation of the carbohydrate on the target cells. As a consequence, anticarbohydrate antibodies with specificity to oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are of a high importance in immunology and are attractive targets for vaccine design (Pazur 1998 ). In the present database, the set of high-resolution structures of carbohydrate-antibody complexes is somehow limited. These studies are typically limited to systems involving antibody fragments, such as the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or variable fragment (Fv), and to small oligosaccharides. Analysis of these complexes reveals general trends about how antibodies recognize different types of carbohydrates. Antibodies which recognize a terminal carbohydrate motif generally feature cavity-like binding sites, where one or more carbohydrate residues are anchored in the cavity by \"end-on\" extension.

In the plant kingdom, lectins have been demonstrated to play a role in defense against pathogens or predators and hypothesized to be involved in establishing symbiosis with mushrooms and bacteria of the Rhizobia species.

Among these structures, 64 % are complexed with a carbohydrate ligand which can be multiforms; i.e., they are monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, or synthetic glyco-compounds from organic chemistry (Table 7 .2).
