Primary objectives of management are prevention and treatment of dehydration and malnutrition.8 Most patients will improve with the administration of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and continuous feeding with their regular diet. Rarely, intravenous fluids may be needed for severe dehydration, intractable vomiting or very high stool output. Although lactose malabsorption develops frequently during acute gastroenteritis, most children can be fed their usual lactose-containing formulas in small frequent feeds. Human milk has high lactose content, yet it reduces stool output and provides excellent nutrients and anti-infectious factors; therefore, breast-feeding should be continued. Moderate to severe malnourished children with diarrhea present a special problem. Malnutrition causes total body sodium excess, potassium and micronutrient deficiencies and increased energy requirements. ReSoMal is recommended for these patients. It is a specially formulated ORS that provides less sodium and more potassium and glucose. Magnesium, zinc and copper are added to ReSoMal.9\n",

Aerosol transmission from respiratory secretions or vomit occurs rarely. Hygienic measures decrease person-to-person spread. However, because these measures are difficult to enforce, particularly in young children, and because some viruses are resistant to commonly used disinfectants, transmission of the disease continues even in developed countries. Outbreaks require isolating ill personnel, thoroughly cooking food, disinfecting the environment and proper handling of food, water and sanitation. Careful hand washing cannot be overemphasized, especially among food handlers and personnel from hospitals, schools and day-care centers. Hospitalized or other institutionalized patients should have universal precautions and contact isolation until 48\u201372 hours after symptom resolution. The best preventive method will be effective, safe and affordable vaccines. Currently, such a vaccine is commercially available only for rotavirus.10\n",

For viral gastroenteritis, an etiologic diagnosis may be desired in specific clinical circumstances or for epidemiologic and research purposes. Detection of viral antigens by immunoassays (IAs) is the method of choice. IAs are simple and rapid, have good sensitivity and specificity, and are practical for testing large numbers of samples. IAs are commercially available for rotaviruses, adenoviruses and astroviruses. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques have been developed for many gastroenteritis viruses. Because they are more sensitive than IAs, they allow viral detection not only in clinical specimens (stools, vomitus) but also in contaminated food, water and fomites. These techniques are most useful for caliciviruses. Electron microscopy (EM) and immune electron microscopy (IEM) identify viruses of distinct morphology and excreted in large numbers (>106 virions/ml of stools), such as rotavirus or astrovirus. However, these techniques are not suitable for a large number of samples or routine laboratory diagnosis. Viral culture is essential for virus characterization, the study of their pathogenesis and the production of diagnostic reagents but is slow and cumbersome. Not all gastroenteritis viruses can be cultured.",

This was the first confirmation of a virus as an etiologic agent of gastroenteritis.11 The virus was named Norwalk virus (NV) and was believed to belong to the Picornaviridae family. Similar viruses were named by the location where they were first identified (Hawaii, Sapporo, etc.) and, as a group, were known as Norwalk-like viruses or small round structured viruses (SRSVs). Soon, it became evident that the SRSVs were different from the picornaviruses in structure, mode of replication and other characteristics. Cloning of the NV genome12 led to the classification of these viruses within the Caliciviridae family.",

Following attachment to specific receptors, the virus enters the cell and is uncoated, and ORF1 produces the NSPs. Synthesis of negative-strand RNA begins. This serves as a template for positive-strand genomic and subgenomic RNA, which will serve as a template for the synthesis of VP1 and VP2. It is known that VP1 can self-assemble to form the capsid, but the process of packing of the viral RNA within the capsid, maturation and release of the virions is poorly understood.14 It is assumed that replication occurs in the epithelial cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract; however, no viral particles have been observed by EM of the jejunal mucosa. While there is no animal model for the human caliciviruses, it has been shown that radiolabeled Norwalk VLPs bind and, in some cases, enter various cell lines.36 The development of a human cell line for norovirus and a murine norovirus model will advance the study of norovirus pathogenesis.37,\n38\n",

They lack virus receptors; repeated challenges with the virus fail to produce illness or antibody response. The virus receptors are histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). These are membrane carbohydrates present on the surface of red blood cells, enterocytes and other mucosal cells. The carbohydrates have an \u03b11,2-linked fucose in common, e.g. Fuco\u03b12Gal\u03b23GlcNac. The protruding domain of VP1 of NV VLPs attaches to this trisaccharide or similar molecules, allowing binding and subsequent internalization of the VLPs. The receptors are host and viral-strain specific. Receptor production is genetically controlled by alleles at the ABO, FUT2 and FUT3 loci. Individuals with O blood group are more easily infected, while B blood group individuals have decreased risk. Individuals with the FUT2 \u2013/\u2013 genotype are highly resistant to NV infections and represent about 20% of the European population.39,\n40\n",

On the virus side, VP4 mediates attachment, and its cleavage into VP5* and VP8* by proteases-like trypsin is essential for cell penetration. Cell penetration also requires VP7. The virus enters the cell either by direct membrane penetration or by receptor-mediated endocytosis; intracellular levels of Ca2+ trigger virus uncoating. RNA synthesis occurs in the core of the virion, mediated by an endogenous RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The RNA transcripts encode the RV proteins, which are translated by the cellular translational machinery. The initial steps of virus replication occur in cytoplasmic inclusions called viroplasms. The viral subparticles bud through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and become mature particles. NSP4 plays a key role in the assembly process, which is Ca2+ dependent. Lastly, mature virus particles are released by cell lysis in nonpolarized cells or by nonclassic vesicular transport in polarized epithelial cells.",

Heterotypic antibodies against different serotypes also occur, but mostly among adults, and vary with the infecting strain.
