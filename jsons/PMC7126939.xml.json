            "text": "Volatility modeling and forecasting (Poon, 2005) is imperative to financial market investors. In finance and econometrics, volatility is defined as the intensity of the fluctuations in the expected return of an investment or the variations in the market\u2019s pricing of a financial asset. Financial volatility forecasts allow the prudent investors to adjust or hedge their investment portfolios to mitigate investment risk and to customize their trading strategies in anticipation of the forthcoming financial market movements. Investment risk refers to an extensive set of factors or events that erodes the financial value of an investment (Poon, 2005). This includes credit risk (i.e. loss due to a debtor\u2019s non-payment) and liquidity risk due to the market\u2019s small capitalization. Hence, financial volatility is one indication of investment risk and is often viewed as a risk metric (Holton, 2003). Financial volatility forecasting is important as volatility is often used as a proxy to measure financial or market risk caused by the underlying uncertainties of the financial market movements (which can have significant positive or negative effects on the values of investment portfolios) due to a myriad of factors. These factors may include recessions, wars, structural changes in the economy, tax law changes, interest rate hikes, inflation pressures, investor anxiety and even changes in consumer preferences.",

            "text": "Furthermore, when viewed as a measure of market uncertainty, financial volatility is a key input in many investment decisions and portfolio creations (Aizenman and Marion, 1999, Chan et al., 1999). The extensive body of research on volatility modeling and forecasting (Anderson et al., 1999, Blair et al., 2001, Engle, 2002, Hamid, 2004, Noh et al., 1994, Poon and Granger, 2003) has reflected the importance of financial volatility to investment decision-making (Busse, 1999, Galeotti and Schiantarelli, 1994, Okuyama and Francis, 2006), security valuation (De Santis et al., 1997, Hsu, 2000), risk management (Christoffersen and Diebold, 2000, Granger, 2002) as well as monetary policy making (Nasar, 1992). Volatility is also a key component in the pricing of derivative securities such as equity options (Duan and Simonato, 2001, Figlewski, 1997, Hull and White, 1987, Noh et al., 1994), where there has been an exponential growth in the trading volume in recent years due to the extensive use of derivatives instruments as hedging and risk management tools. In addition, national policy makers, financial regulators and central banks often relied on estimates of financial volatility to assess the effectiveness of regulatory measures on the financial markets (Poon & Granger, 2003). Given its widespread importance, it is therefore not surprising that financial volatility has emerged as a key asset class in today\u2019s financial markets. That is, sophisticated investors can trade in financial instruments defined on market volatility. For example, the VIX index\n1 (Chicago Board Options Exchange) introduced in 2003 by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is based on the short term volatilities of options issued on the S&P 500 index, which tracks the stock performances of 500 large-cap corporations trading on the US stock markets (i.e. NYSE and Nasdaq). The creation of the VIX volatility index allows a savvy investor to leverage on his estimates of the fluctuations of the financial market movements through the use of futures contracts to achieve investment profits during rising, falling and side-ways markets.",

            "text": "Hence, given the extensive applications of volatility forecasting, the research on financial volatility modeling and prediction has been the primary focus of academics and practitioners of financial econometrics over the years. Excellent reviews and research of the subject are reported in Knight and Stephen, 2002, Poon and Granger, 2003, Hans Franses and McAleer, 2002 and Poon (2005). In brief, there are three general notions (measures) of financial volatility in the literature, namely historical volatility, implied volatility and model-based volatility. Historical volatility (HV) is backward-looking and is generally computed from a time-series of the continuously compounded returns of the underlying security or asset. In this measure, the compounded investment return r\nc(t) of the underlying security is computed daily and it is defined as r\nc(t) = log (c(t)/c(t\n \u2212 1)), where c(t) denotes the current closing valuation of the financial security and c(t\n \u2212 1) refers to the price level of the previous trading day. This corresponds to the day-on-day change in the financial valuation of the underlying security. Subsequently, the volatility HV(t) for a trading day t is defined as the statistical deviation or weighted deviation of the returns time-series {r\nc(t\n \u2212 \nn\n + 1)\u2223n\n = 1, \u2026 ,N}, where N denotes the length of the historical price path considered in the computation of the volatility measure.",

That is, as implied volatility is based on the current market prices of the options, it contains all the forward expectations of the investors about the likely future price path of the underlying security. The implied volatility of an option contract is defined as the financial volatility that produces the traded (market) price of the option based on a selected option pricing model. In practice, the black\u2013scholes model (Black & Scholes, 1973) and its variants (Gencay and Gibson, 2007, Grace, 2000) are often used to price the options traded in the derivatives markets. Empirically, it has been observed that the computed IVs of the options issued on the same underlier and with the same time to maturity often exhibit a nonlinear relationship known as the volatility smile (Derman and Kani, 1994, Dupire, 1994) with respect to the different strike prices of the options. This is generally regarded as evidence that an underlier\u2019s implied financial volatility is not constant, but instead, depends on factors such as the price level of the underlying security and the exercise prices of the options. For these reasons, at-the-money (ATM) or nearly ATM options are often used as the reference entities to compute the implied volatilities in financial volatility modeling and prediction studies (Poon & Granger, 2003).",

Within the ARCH and GARCH frameworks, the objective is to model the continuously compounded investment returns time-series {r\nc(t)} of an underlying financial instrument using a predictable conditional mean model \u03bc(t) and a stochastic conditional variance model that defines the innovations \u03b5(t) of the returns time-series, i.e. r\nc(t) = \n\u03bc(t) + \n\u03b5(t), such that\u03bc(t)=\u03d5+\u2211i=1N1airc(t-i)(autoregressive model)\n(1)\u03b5(t)=\u03c3(t)z(t)(stochastic innovation model)where t denotes the current trading day; \u03d5 is a constant; N\n1 is the order of the regressive model; z(t) \u223c \nN(0, 1) is a Gaussian-distributed random variable; and the (conditional) variance \u03c3\n2(t) of the innovations of the time-series {r\nc(t)} is modeled as an autoregressive process of previous innovations and variances, i.e.(2)\u03c32(t)=\u03ba+\u2211i=1N2bi\u03b52(t-i)+\u2211i=1N3ci\u03c32(t-i)(GARCH model)where \u03ba is a modeling constant; and {N\n2, \nN\n3} are the orders of the GARCH model. The coefficients {\u03d5, \na\ni, \n\u03ba, \nb\ni, \nc\ni} of the modeling process defined in Eqs. (1), (2) are generally obtained via maximum likelihood estimation. The time-varying model-based volatility MV(t) of the underlying financial asset is subsequently defined to be the identified conditional deviation \u03c3(t).",

            "text": "One of the most important stylized facts of financial volatility is the presence of volatility clustering or volatility persistency in historically observed data, i.e. high volatility is often followed by periods of high volatility and low volatility by periods of low volatility (Bollerslev & Engel, 1993). This empirical observation about financial volatility has deep implications for volatility forecasting, and supports the notion that current and past values of volatility can be used to predict future volatility levels. In this paper, the use of a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model (Tung and Quek, 2008, Tung and Quek, 2010) that employs the notion of incremental sequential learning (Ratcliff, 1990) to model and forecast the volatility levels of the Hang Seng Index\n2 (HSI) across a five-year period spanning from 2002 to 2006 is investigated. The computed volatility forecasts are subsequently used to capitalize on the movements of the Hong Kong stock market by performing straddle trading\n3 using an automated option trading system that is based on the moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) (Colby, 2002, Pring, 2002) principle. There are two primary motivations to this piece of work. They are: (1) to develop an intelligent trading system endowed with human-like information processing capabilities and a logical reasoning schema to support the decision-making process of a human trader in performing financial volatility trading, and (2) to address the lagging (reactive) nature of the MACD trading rule and to enhance its timeliness in spotting trading opportunities by introducing forward-looking (forecasting) capability to the computation of the underlying trend signals. These are explained as follows.",

Such information is then used to detect future trading opportunities, constituting the human approach to financial trend modeling and judgemental forecasting (Lawrence & O\u2019Connor, 1992). However, current technical volatility modeling and forecasting methods (a comprehensive review can be found in Section 3 of Poon & Granger (2003)) are often based on statistical or continuous time finance theories that are generally mathematically convoluted, which erodes their intuitiveness to a human investor. The proposed use of eFSM as a semantic neural-fuzzy based approach to the modeling and projection of financial volatility trends, on the other hand, bridges the knowledge chasm as it enables a human investor to examine the inherent trend information extracted from the historical observations via highly interpretable IF\u2013THEN fuzzy rules. Moreover, since high frequency financial data is inherently noisy, eFSM can mitigate the effects of the noise artifacts on the computed volatility predictions as it employs Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets to model (generalize) the characteristics of the past volatility fluctuations. This helps to preserve the salient patterns and predictable trends of the financial volatility time-series. Furthermore, the self-organising eFSM can spot financial trends in huge amounts of data that may not be immediately apparent to a human trader.",

This enables eFSM to construct a more robust and adaptive forecasting model in contrast to many existing neural-fuzzy modeling techniques. Furthermore, eFSM employs the compositional-rule-of-inference (CRI) schema (Zadeh, 1994), a logical fuzzy reasoning scheme that mimics the human reasoning process, to define its computations. From a human trader\u2019s perspective, this provides added credence to the computed volatility projections. Lastly, as the MACD trading rule employs historical time-indexed data to obtain the trending signals, the resultant trading decisions computed from these signals are inevitably time-delayed. Therefore, the use of eFSM as a model to forecast the future HSI volatility levels and the subsequent use of such forward projections in the computation of the MACD trading decisions help to address the lagging nature of the MACD trading rule.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, neural-fuzzy systems have been successfully deployed to solve many modeling problems (Chong et al., 2009, Juang and Lin, 2001, Quek et al., 2001, Quek et al., 2010, Talei et al., 2010, Tan et al., 2008, Tong et al., 2000, Tung et al., 2004, Wai and Lin, 1998). However, the complex and dynamic nature of real-world applications demanded that neural-fuzzy systems be able to adapt their structures, parameters and ultimately evolve their intelligence to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the underlying data generating processes. The usefulness of existing neural-fuzzy systems such as ANFIS (Jang, 1993), POPFNN (Ang and Quek, 2005, Quek and Zhou, 1996), HyFIS (Kim & Kasabov, 1999), EFuNN (Kasabov, 2001), SOFNNGA (Leng, McGinnity, & Prasad, 2006), RPOP-TVR (Wong, Cho, & Quek, 2009), FASCOM (Goh, Lim, & Quek, 2009) and FITSK (Quah & Quek, 2006) are, however, generally constrained to static environments as their training/rule generation procedures unrealistically assumed that the characteristics of the underlying data generating processes being modeled do not change with time. Hence, these systems often employed batched\n4 or pseudo-incremental\n5 learning approaches to construct (i.e. identify and tune) their respective fuzzy rule (knowledge) bases and are ill-equipped for the modeling of more complex time-varying processes. These neural-fuzzy systems lacked the capability to acquire any new information that emerges after the training of the embedded fuzzy model has been completed. Attempts to adapt to the changing underlying process generally require re-training to rebuild the entire neural-fuzzy system since incremental learning of the new patterns (information) will modify the trained fuzzy model in such a way that the originally learned but possibly still valid knowledge is forgotten or replaced. That is, the newly emerging information \u201ccatastrophically\u201d erased the fuzzy model\u2019s memory of the previously learned knowledge (French, 2003), and the resultant phenomenon of degraded computing performances is known as the stability-plasticity dilemma (Grossberg, 1982).",

            "text": "In contrast, humans are often observed to learn new things prolifically and spontaneously without forgetting the old information (McClelland, McNaughton, & O\u2019Reilly, 1995). This phenomenon is referred to as sequential learning in machine learning research (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989). Hence, the learning mechanisms of eFSM are modeled after certain information processing capabilities of the human brain (specifically the hippocampus) to enable it to robustly organize the knowledge extracted from the data observations presented. Particularly, the human hippocampal formation is capable of a neurogenesis process (Kempermann, Wiskott, & Gage, 2004) that has been regarded as the primary mechanism used to resolve the learning stability-plasticity dilemma in the human brain (Wiskott, Rasch, & Kempermann, 2006) during the acquisition of the human semantic memories\n6 (Eichenbaum, 2004). Furthermore, empirical evidences have established that the human hippocampus and its surrounding cortices are directly involved in the detection of input novelty and associative novelty to facilitate the recognition of information (Brown and Aggleton, 2001, Nyberg, 2005), which plays a critical role in updating the human representation of the changing world (O\u2019Keefe & Nadel, 1978). These information processing capabilities are generally ascribed to two complementary functions of the human hippocampus; namely, as a recall comparator (Vinogradova, 2001) and as a novelty/familiarity detector (Clark & Gronlund, 1996). Therefore, to computationally mimic facets of how the human hippocampus performs the sequential learning of information, the rule-generating procedure of the eFSM model is designed based on its recall comparator as well as the novelty/familiarity detection principles. Details of this rule-generating procedure are reported in Tung and Quek (2008).",

LTP is the strengthening of the synaptic connection between two repeatedly intensely excited neurons and is responsible for the learning/reinforcement of memory traces in the hippocampal formation. LTD, on the other hand, is the weakening of the synaptic connection between two neurons due to persistent weak excitations. Thus, it is regarded as the main mechanism of \u2018forgetting\u2019. Hence, the human hippocampus possesses highly evolved and elegant mechanisms to maintain up-to-date memory traces. Computationally, the eFSM model mimics these neural mechanisms via the use of fuzzy rule potentials with the LTP and LTD concepts (see Section 2.3) to construct a set of evolving IF\u2013THEN Mamdani fuzzy rules to model non-stationary data generating processes.",

This resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma of eFSM as a knowledge learning system. However, obsolete fuzzy rules that no longer describe the observed data characteristics due to changes in the underlying data generating process have to be pruned from eFSM in order to maintain a compact and current rule (knowledge) base. This is achieved via the use of fuzzy rule potentials and the LTP and LTD concepts introduced in Section 2.1. The potential P\nk of a fuzzy rule R\nk in eFSM defines its importance/influence in the entire rule (knowledge) base of the system. Hence, a fuzzy rule with a high potential is significant in describing or generalizing the characteristics of a large chunk of recently encountered training patterns. Each rule in eFSM has a fuzzy rule potential that is continuously computed based on the LTP and LTD principles. The potential P\nnew of a newly created fuzzy rule is defined as unity, and P\nk is updated based on the current training data pair (X(t), \nD(t)) using Eq. (12).(12)Pk(t+1)=Pk(t)+Rk(X(t))\u00d7Rkback(D(t))where P\nk(t) is the potential of rule R\nk prior to the presentation of the training pair (X(t), \nD(t)); and R\nk(X(t)) and Rkback(D(t)) are as defined in Eqs. (6), (11), respectively. Hence, the significance (potential) of the associativity of a fuzzy rule in eFSM is enhanced or reinforced if its input conditions and expected consequents are similar to the information expressed in the training pair (X(t), \nD(t)). This functionally mimics the LTP mechanism observed in the human hippocampus.",

Existing fuzzy rules in the eFSM model may become obsolete and no longer reflect the current knowledge as the dynamics of the underlying data generating process changes. Hence, a forgetting mechanism is employed to systematically remove the unwanted rules (memory associations) from eFSM. This reduces the complexity of the fuzzy rule-base and maintains a set of up-to-date fuzzy rules that describes the current characteristics of the underlying process being modeled. Forgetting is simulated by reducing the potentials of the fuzzy rules according to their current values. This is described in Eq. (13).(13)Pk(t+1)=\u03bbPk(t),\u03bb<1where \u03bb is the forgetting rate. This generates exponential forgetting and results in a decay of the significance of a fuzzy rule R\nk in eFSM. Rule R\nk is removed from the rule-base of eFSM if its potential falls below a fraction of that assigned for a newly created fuzzy rule, i.e. P\nk(t\n + 1) < \n\u03c5P\nnew. In this paper, \u03c5 and \u03bb are pre-defined as 0.25 and 0.99 respectively. Combining Eqs. (12), (13), the overall potential of a fuzzy rule R\nk in eFSM is defined as Eq.

This eventually keeps the fuzzy rule within the rule-base of eFSM. On the other hand, if a fuzzy rule has become insignificant due to changes in the underlying process, then LTD will be dominant in the computation of its rule potential. This subsequently results in a low fuzzy rule potential and the rule is removed if its potential falls below the pre-determined threshold \u03c5P\nnew.",

Options provide a means to manage financial risks and are playing an increasingly important role in modern financial markets (Chance, 2004). From a financial perspective, having the right to buy or sell an asset without the obligation to complete the transaction has economic value. Therefore, options are traded as an asset in the financial markets. Options belong to a class of financial products generally referred to as derivative securities whose returns are derived from those of other financial instruments, in this case, the underlying physical or financial assets for which the options are issued (Boyle & Boyle, 2001). Options are traded openly on derivative markets such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or over-the-counter privately between two parties. In the option markets, the price of a traded option depends on several factors. These include the price of the underlier (which determines the intrinsic value of the option), time to maturity of the option contract (which influences its time value), market volatility of the underlying asset, the current risk-free interest rate, the strike (exercise) price of the option and the type of option contract (i.e. American or European contract). In this paper, the options issued on the Hang Seng Index are European contracts and all future discussions are based on such European options.",

For an at-the-money (ATM) Call option, \u03b1 denotes the market (purchase) price of the option. Hence, a trader stands to lose at most a capital equivalent to \u03b1 should the option expires at-the-money or out-of-the-money (OTM); i.e. S\nT\n \u2a7d \nX, where S\nT is the price of the underlier at the time the option expires. However, if the price of the underlier increases above the exercise (strike) price of the Call option, the option will become in-the-money (ITM). If the Call option expires as in-the-money, its value is derived from the difference of the underlier price and the strike price; i.e. C\nT\n = \nS\nT\n \u2212 \nX, where C\nT is the value of the Call option at expiration. Hence, the overall profit/loss (P/L) to a trader for investing in the Call option is computed as P/L\n = max (0, \nS\nT\n \u2212 \nX) \u2212 \n\u03b1. This is reflected as the P/L function in Fig. 2(a). The price dynamics, intrinsic value and profit/loss functions for a Put option are analyzed in a similar way. From Fig. 2(b), the label \u03b2 denotes the capital invested in buying a Put option that is at-the-money. For a Put option, as the price of the underlier decreases, the value of the option increases and vice versa. When the price of the underlying asset is zero, the maximum theoretical price of a Put option is X (i.e. no investor will pay more to receive a lesser payout). The profit/loss to an investor for investing in a Put option is determined by P/L\n = max (0, \nX\n \u2212 \nS\nT) \u2212 \n\u03b2. Hence, a trader loses at most the capital of \u03b2 if the ATM Put option that he has bought expires with no value (i.e. max (0,X\n \u2212 \nS\nT) = 0\u2223X \u2a7d \nS\nT). On the other hand, he will break-even on his investment if the Put option expires with a value of \u03b2 (i.e. {\u03b2\n = \nX\n \u2212 \nS\nT\u2223S\nT\n < \nX}).

Straddles are a good strategy to pursue if an investor believes that an underlier\u2019s price will move significantly (i.e. high price volatility), but is unsure as to in which direction the price will move. As shown in Fig. 3, the underlying asset price must move significantly if the investor is to make a profit from buying (longing) the ATM straddle. If there is only a small movement in the underlier\u2019s price occurring in either direction (i.e. low price volatility), the investor will experience a loss as the value of the straddle is less than the capital outlay of \u03b3 to purchase it. The investment on the straddle is said to break-even when the value of the straddle equals to its acquisition price \u03b3\n = \n\u03b1\n + \n\u03b2. On the other hand, the reverse is true for selling (shorting) the ATM straddle. That is, a trader will suffer a loss if he sells a straddle and the underlier\u2019s price subsequently experienced high volatility or encountered a large price movement in either direction. A profit is possible only if the price of the underlying asset does not deviate too far from the strike price of the straddle sold (i.e. low price volatility). Hence, an intelligent straddle trading system is proposed in this paper to capitalize on the financial volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. Such a trading system will long (short) a straddle defined on the Hang Seng Index when high (low) volatility of the index movement is expected.",

The primary mechanism of MACD is to use moving averages (which are lagging indicators) to track the movements in a financial data time-series such as a stock market index or the price of a financial asset. The use of moving averages attenuates or smoothes the spurious oscillations (rapid reversals of trends) and helps to identify the general movements of a time-series. Commonly, MACD is defined as the difference (see Eq. (15)) between the 12-days exponential moving average (i.e. EMA12) and the 26-days exponential moving average (EMA26) of a time-series, although other time periods may also be used. That is,(15)MACD=EMA12-EMA26and the exponential moving average (EMA) of a price/index data series P is computed as Eq. (16):(16)EMAn(t)=k(p(t))+(1-k)(EMAn(t-1))where EMAn(t) is the current n-days EMA of the data series P; EMAn(t\n \u2212 1) is the previously computed EMA; p(t) is the current observed value of P; and k\n = 2/(1 + \nn) is the smoothing constant. EMA12 and EMA26 are also popularly known as the fast and slow signals of the MACD trading rule, as the former tracks a shorter historical time frame and is therefore more responsive to recent movements of the data series than the latter. Hence, a more generic definition is MACD = EMAFast\n \u2212 EMASlow. Fig. 4\ndepicts the fast and slow EMA for the stock price of Merrill Lynch Co. from 26 August to 22 November 1999.

As one can observe from the figure, both the fast and slow EMA are lagging indicators as the EMA signals captured the trend reversals much later after the direction of the stock price of Merrill Lynch Co. has changed. From Eq. (15), MACD tracks the difference between the fast and slow EMA. MACD is positive when EMA12 is above EMA26 and vice versa.

MACD is often referred to as a momentum oscillator as the MACD signal oscillates above and below the zero reference line, and an increasing difference between the two EMA signals reflects a faster rate-of-change of one signal over the other. Hence, if the fast signal (EMA12) is rising quicker than the slow signal (EMA26), a positive (bullish) momentum is captured by computing the MACD.

The EMA9 of the MACD signal (i.e. MACD_EMA9) is shown as the thin solid line in the bottom half of Fig. 4. The MACD histogram is depicted as the bar plot and illustrates the differences between the MACD signal and its EMA9 trigger line.

The HSI is the main indicator of the stock market performance in Hong Kong and its fluctuations therefore served as a proxy to the financial volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The performance of the straddle trading system is subsequently evaluated by analyzing the investment returns r(t) from the straddle trades that were performed, which eventually defined the overall financial profit or loss R achieved by the system that is inclusive of the trading costs \u03b4 incurred.",

As described earlier, the MACD trading rule employs the notion of moving averages that subsequently results in the generation of delayed trading signals. In order to address this inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule for the proposed straddle trading system, the predicted future values of the volatility measure of HSI are employed in the computation of the fast and slow EMA signals. Let Y\n = {y(t), \ny(t\n \u2212 1), \ny(t\n \u2212 2), \u2026} denotes the time-ordered sequence of the financial volatility measures (i.e. historical, implied or model-based volatilities) characterizing the movements of the observed Hang Seng Index up to the current time t. Since Y is a regularly-sampled time-series with no missing value, the prediction of the immediate future value of Y (i.e. y(t\n + 1)) given the observed historical values of the time-series (i.e. y(t), \ny(t\n \u2212 1), \ny(t\n \u2212 2), \u2026) can be formulated as an autoregressive problem f as shown in Eq. (17).(17)y\u02c6(t+1)=f(y(t),y(t-1),\u2026,y(t-n+1))where y\u02c6(t+1) denotes the predicted immediate future value of the time-series Y; and n is the modeling horizon or embedding dimension (Packard et al., 1980, Vitrano and Povinelli, 2001) that defines the number of past values and the delays to be used for the prediction. The prediction objective is therefore to minimize the error (difference) between y\u02c6(t+1) and the subsequently observed actual time-series value y(t\n + 1). In financial time-series prediction or financial forecasting, the autoregressive problem f as shown in Eq. (17) has been optimized via various techniques (e.g. statistical regression, stochastic regression, neural networks, fuzzy systems, support vector machines and evolutionary computations) for stock price modeling and prediction (Ang and Quek, 2006, Saad et al., 1998), forecasting of financial variables (Noh et al., 1994, Refenes et al., 1997), equity returns (Apte and Hong, 1994, Kuan and Liu, 1995) and stock market indices (Chen et al., 2003, Yang and Yang, 2003), as well as the optimization of portfolio composition and trading strategy (Moody & Saffell, 2001).",

The breakdowns of the various trade decisions are presented as follows.(a)\nTrader has short-sold (shorted) an ATM straddle (i.e. F(t\n \u2212 \n1)\n \n=\n \u22121): The trade decision module has to decide on the appropriate trading action (denoted as TD\nShort(t)) for the current trading day t based on the conditions described in Eq.

This reduces the detrimental effects of accruing unnecessary transaction costs from the excessive trading of the option straddles.(c)\nTrader has bought (longed) an ATM straddle (i.e. F(t\n \u2212 \n1)\n \n=\n \n1): The trade decision module decides whether to sell off the straddle or to maintain the holding position based on Eq.

That is,(26)TDLong(t)=-1,volatility to decreasei.e.MACD^(t+1)\u2a7dMACD^_EMA(t+1)0,otherwise(i.e.minimal change or volatility expected to increase)Therefore, the proposed straddle trading system will hold onto the longed position if the HSI volatility is expected to increase or change minimally. Otherwise, the trading system will sell off the option straddle and returns to the neutral position.\n",

(28), (29), the proposed trading system will apply the exit strategy to close its open position on the ATM straddle whenever the traded straddle experienced a 5% decline in its market value or has achieved a 10% gain in its traded price. This limits the downside risk while allowing the trader to reap significant profits from the correct projections of the Hong Kong stock market volatility. On the other hand, condition (C1) ensures that the trader is not in a losing position (albeit a small one) for a prolonged period of time. In summary, the above discussion presents the computational mechanisms (trading strategy) of the proposed intelligent straddle trading system that consists of a volatility prediction module based on the eFSM semantic neural-fuzzy network and the MACD-driven trade decision module that generates the trading signals for the straddle trades. The next section evaluates the performance of the straddle trading system using real-life data obtained from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE).",

The information in the dataset includes the expiry dates, strike prices, daily settlements and the daily black\u2013scholes implied volatilities of all the live European-styled options issued on the HSI, as well as the recorded closing levels of the Hong Kong bourse (i.e. the HSI) during the observation period. All the information is obtained via the Hong Kong Exchange Corporation (Hong Kong Exchange). From the daily closing levels of the HSI and the information recorded in the options dataset, the three volatility measures of the Hong Kong stock market, namely the historical volatility (HV), implied volatility (IV) and model-based volatility (MV) as described in Section 1, are computed. These respective volatility measures subsequently formed three different time-ordered data series. The HV time-series is obtained via Eq. (30), which uses the 30-days historical standard deviation of the log-returns series {r\nc(t)} as a proxy to the implicit HSI volatility. That is (see Eq.

This could be due to the post September-11 effects (where there were a lot of uncertainties and fears about the strength of the US economy after the terrorist attacks and the related fallout on the health of the global economy), as well as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Asia in early 2003 that greatly eroded investors\u2019 confidence in the Asian stock markets.

The training set consists of documented volatility data observed for the initial two years (i.e. Jan 2002 to Dec 2003) while the test set contains data recorded for the remaining three years (i.e. Jan 2004 to Dec 2006) of the observation period. The eFSM volatility modeling and prediction system is trained using information in the training set and its forecasting accuracies duly assessed using the withheld test set. Four measures are adopted to track the modeling and forecasting capabilities of the eFSM-based VPM. They are, namely: (1) the pearson correlation index (denoted as PC) (Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988); (2) the mean squared error (MSE) (Lehmann & Casella, 1998); (3) the average relative variance (ARV); and (4) the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measures. The pearson correlation index PC, with a range of [\u22121, +1], is a measure of the linearity of the predicted and actual volatility trends. That is, a correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, which means that both the predicted and actual HSI volatilities move in the same direction together. The MSE, ARV and MAPE measures, on the other hand, tracks the forecast accuracies of the predicted to the actual observed HSI volatility levels. The MSE, ARV and MAPE measures are mathematically defined in Eqs. (33), (34), (35), respectively.(33)MSE=1N\u2211i=1Ny(i)-y\u02c6(i)2\n(34)ARV=\u2211i=1Ny(i)-y\u02c6(i)2\u2211i=1N(y(i)-y\u00af)2\n(35)MAPE=1N\u2211i=1Ny(i)-y\u02c6(i)y(i)\u00d7100%where y\n(i) denotes the actual observed HSI volatility level for trading day i in the test set; y\u02c6(i) is the corresponding predicted volatility computed by the eFSM-based VPM; y\u00af=1/N\u2211i=1Ny(i) represents the baseline mean output prediction; and N denotes the number of trading days in the test set. Of the performance indicators specified in Eqs. (33), (34), (35), MSE measures the average squared prediction error for each observation in the evaluated volatility time-series, while ARV serves as a baseline benchmark in comparing the prediction accuracies of the eFSM model to the mean output predictor. Lastly, MAPE tracks the mean absolute error in percent between the actual and the eFSM forecasted values across all volatility observations in the HV and IV time-series.

For both the recall and generalization assessments, the eFSM model has been trained using the training set defined earlier. In recall, the trained eFSM model is assessed using inputs from the training set (i.e. to determine how well it has learnt the volatility trend information in the training data) while for generalization, the eFSM model is evaluated with the unseen inputs from the test set.

This is reflected by a high pearson correlation (PC) value of 0.964 as well as a low mean squared error MSE of 0.699. This small modeling error is also tracked by MAPE, which indicated that on average, the error expected of the predicted historical volatility level for each trading day in the training set is approximately 3.4% of its true (subsequently observed) value. The ARV measure also showed that eFSM performed superbly when compared to the baseline mean output predictor. The forecasting capability of the eFSM model is subsequently evaluated using the withheld test set. As observed, the accuracy of the predicted volatility levels for trading days of 2004\u20132006 that constitutes the test set degrades when compared to the recall performance of eFSM on the training set. This is indicated by the larger MSE, ARV and MAPE values. Specifically, the mean expected forecast error for the historical volatility level of each trading day in the test period has increased to approximately 5%. On examination, the lower forecast performance of eFSM on the test set is due to significant prediction errors at two prominent durations in the test period. These durations are denoted as subperiod \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 respectively in Fig. 10. Subperiod \u2018a\u2019 is characterized by a series of intense fluctuations in the HV data-series, and this could have contributed to the large prediction errors by the eFSM-based volatility projection module. On the other hand, the poor performance by eFSM at subperiod \u2018b\u2019 could be due to the lack of similar trends in the training set. It is observed that at subperiod \u2018b\u2019, there is a significant increase in the volatility of the Hong Kong financial market as shown by the sharp rapid rise from trough to peak of the volatility curve. However, similar volatility trends in the training set have a smaller magnitude of increase and this is followed by a rapid fall. Hence, this could have caused eFSM to forecast a plunge in the volatility level, leading to significant prediction errors in the result plot.",

Noticeably, ANFIS and CMAC produced the poorest results amongst all the evaluated modeling techniques.

The CMAC network, on the other hand, had poor generalization performance for the unseen volatility trends in the test set as it employed discrete (and uniformly spaced) partitions to define its memory surface. This caused many untrained (or under-trained) memory cells to be accessed and resulted in poor volatility forecasts. Meanwhile, the FFNN-BP model, as expected, returned another set of disappointing results for the generalization task as it had earlier failed to properly model the volatility trends of the training set. The remaining two benchmarking systems, namely HyFIS and RBF, performed better than the three techniques discussed above. A plausible reason is the use of Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets in HyFIS to model both the input and output clusters of the volatility data space, and the use of Gaussian radial basis functions in the RBF network to define the local models employed to model the volatility fluctuations. This equips the two modeling techniques with better generalization capabilities for the unseen volatility trends in the test set. However, the results in Table 1 have clearly shown that the forecasting (generalization) performance of the eFSM model compared favorably to all the benchmarking techniques. Specifically, eFSM achieved the highest performance index (PI) of 0.438 amongst all the evaluated modeling techniques and also had the smallest prediction errors as indicated by the various accuracy measures. This superior performance is possibly due to the use of Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets to model the volatility trends in the training set as well as the learning and computational processes of the eFSM model.",

On the other hand, although the HyFIS and ANFIS networks are neural-fuzzy systems like the eFSM model, there are deficiencies inherent to these two techniques that hinder the efforts of a human trader to decipher their acquired knowledge. Specifically, the training process of HyFIS causes excessive and unconstrained overlapping of its computed fuzzy sets, which makes assigning proper semantic meanings to these fuzzy sets difficult. The ANFIS network, on the other hand, employs the TS fuzzy model that computes with functional consequents. This subsequently reduces the transparency and interpretability of its fuzzy rule-base.",

From Fig. 12, one can observe that the eFSM model has achieved considerably consistent results across the recall and generalization tasks. That is, there is only a slight degradation in performance as indicated by the respective performance indices PI. Specifically, the expected error for each volatility projection increased from approximately 2.6% for the recall assessment using the training set to about 3.8% for the generalization evaluation using the test set. This increase in forecasting error on the test set is plausibly due to noticeable wayward projections occurring at subperiods \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 denoted in Fig. 12. In addition, when compared to the HV modeling and forecasting results depicted in Fig. 10, one can easily conclude that the eFSM model has achieved a better overall performance in volatility projections using the IV time-series data.

This causes large forecasting errors in the volatility projections computed by the three networks.

This is due to the use of a linear activation function for the output node in FFNN-BP, the linear consequent function in the TS fuzzy model of the ANFIS network, and the computation of the output of the eFSM model via a fusion of the Mamdani and TS fuzzy models. More importantly, Table 2 has shown that eFSM has a better forecasting capability than the FFNN-BP and ANFIS networks, as it is able to sufficiently capture the volatility fluctuations in the training set using the brain-inspired LTP and LTD learning mechanisms and to sensibly extend the acquired knowledge to derive projections for the unseen test set.",

Three different measures are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong financial market. They are, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI). These measures subsequently formed three time-ordered volatility data series characterizing the fluctuations of the HSI.",

            "text": "At the core of the proposed straddle trading system is the trade decision module (TDM) that employs the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle with the various volatility time-series to generate the trading signals (in the form of trade decisions) in response to the different trading scenarios encountered by a human trader. However, the MACD trading rule inherently generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed by employing a volatility projection module (VPM) that forecasts the future volatility levels of the HSI prior to the activation of TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. eFSM approximates a nonlinear regression function that forecasts the future HSI volatility levels based on historically observed fluctuations. The computing structure of the eFSM model evolves dynamically with the arrival of each training data presented. The learning mechanisms of eFSM are designed to functionally emulate the information processing capabilities of the human hippocampus where prior to the start of the learning process, there are no fuzzy rules in the eFSM structure. New fuzzy rules are dynamically added and old rules that no longer describe the current data characteristics observed are removed based on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) mechanisms observed in the human brain during the learning phase. This allows the eFSM model to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market. In addition, the computations of eFSM mimics the human way of reasoning and the trained structure of the eFSM model can be interpreted by a human trader as a set of linguistic fuzzy semantic rules. These desirable attributes provided added credence to the computed volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of eFSM are encouraging when subsequently benchmarked to several well-known computational intelligence based modeling techniques such as the ANFIS, HyFIS and CMAC neural networks.",

More importantly, the observed trading results indicated that the trading strategy adopted by the trade decision module (TDM) of the proposed straddle trading framework is technically viable in capitalizing the uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market for financial volatility trading and achieved a significant return over the interest rate offered by a Hong Kong time deposit account.",
