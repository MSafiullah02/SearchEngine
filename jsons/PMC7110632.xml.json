            "text": "One of the most important factors in preventing infectious disease in columbid flocks is to incorporate a sound preventative medicine program. Medications are thus rarely necessary if these guidelines are followed by the pigeon fancier:Buy quality stock from quality breeders. Do not introduce new birds into an existing flock until they have been quarantined and physically examined. The optimal length of quarantine is the time for a pair to raise two or three sets of babies. When quarantine is over, introduce one pair at a time to the existing flock. Allow each pair to establish territory before adding the next pair. This method minimizes the stress of pairs finding a place in the loft.Examine all new birds for ectoparasites, such as lice, mites, and pigeon flies. Perform fecal floatation and direct smears to check for helminths and Coccidia sp. Examine throat aspirates for trichomonads and blood smears for Hemoproteus sp. If test results are negative, do not administer any medications, because evidence suggests that some drugs cause immunosuppression.During quarantine, vaccinate all new acquisitions for paramyxovirus1 (PMV1). Salmonella vaccination is optional and is of questionable efficacy. Vaccination for pigeon pox is ideally done after other vaccines, because birds will have an active case of pox that can decrease the immune response to the other vaccines if these are given concurrently. Some practitioners administer all three vaccines at the same time, however, with no apparent ill effects.Vaccinate all young birds at least 6 to 8 weeks before racing or show season. Do not add unvaccinated birds to the flock at this time because they could contract clinical poxvirus infection.Keep pigeons in a clean, dry, well-ventilated loft. Do not overcrowd. Feed the birds according to their needs. If a problem arises, seek a diagnosis before administering medications.\n",

When lice are found by the clinician, other diseases should be considered. Heavy louse infestations usually indicate a debilitated bird that might not feel well enough to groom properly. Dermanyssus gallinae and Ornithonyssus sylviarum cause skin irritation and feed on blood. They are called red mites or roost mites and are found on the bird at night. Knemidokoptes mutans, the scaly leg mite, causes considerable skin damage. K laevis, the depluming mite, is rare.",

Ivermectin and pyrethrin are effective against lice when used properly. The author (L.W.) reports that fipronil (Frontline; Merial, Athens, Georgia) 0.29% spray has been used off-label successfully by wildlife rehabilitators on pigeons and raptor veterinarians to remove hippoboscids and also reduce black flies and mosquitoes. The suggested dose is two to three squirts under each wing and tail every 30 days. One of the metabolites of fipronil has higher toxicity to birds than the parent compound; use the product carefully because it shows variable toxicity in different avian families.55\n",
