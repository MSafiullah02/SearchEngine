[5] [6] [7] Older patients and those with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular conditions appear to be at the greatest risk for severe complications. 6, 7 In the absence of a proven effective therapy, current management consists of supportive care, including invasive and noninvasive oxygen support and treatment with antibiotics. 8, 9 In addition, many patients have received off-label or compassionate-use therapies, including antiretrovirals, antiparasitic agents, antiinflammatory compounds, and convalescent plasma. [10] [11] [12] [13] Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analogue that is intracellularly metabolized to an analogue of adenosine triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Remdesivir has broadspectrum activity against members of several virus families, including filoviruses (e.g., Ebola) and coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] ) and has shown prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in nonclinical models of these coronaviruses. [14] [15] [16] [17] In vitro testing has also shown that remdesivir has activity against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir appears to have a favorable clinical safety profile, as reported on the basis of experience in approximately 500 persons, including healthy volunteers and patients treated for acute Ebola virus infection, 18, 19 and supported by our data (on file and shared with the World Health Organization [WHO] ).

This preliminary report describes the clinical outcomes in a small cohort of patients who were severely ill with Covid-19 and were treated with remdesivir. Although data from several ongoing randomized, controlled trials will soon provide more informative evidence Baseline (day 0) was the day on which treatment with remdesivir (RDV) was initiated. Final oxygen support statuses shown are based on the most recent reported data. For each patient, the colors in the line represent the oxygen-support status of the patient over time. The colored circles to the left of each line indicate the patient's overall change in status from baseline. A patient's status \"improved\" if the oxygen-support status improved before the last follow-up or the patient was discharged. The vertical black marks show the last day of treatment with RDV. The gray dashed lines represent missing data between the patient's most recent reported oxygen status and an event (death or discharge) or the last dose of RDV. A solid square at the end of a line indicates that the patient died; an open diamond indicates that the patient was discharged from the hospital. If there is neither a square nor a diamond at the end of a line, neither death nor discharge had occurred. Patient 2 was breathing ambient air through day 36. Patients 19 and 31 were discharged on day 44. Clinical improvement is shown in the full cohort, in the cohort stratified according to ventilation status at baseline, and in the cohort stratified by age. regarding the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for Covid-19, the outcomes observed in this compassionate-use program are the best currently available data. Specifically, improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 68% of patients, and overall mortality was 13% over a median follow-up of 18 days. In a recent randomized, controlled trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized for Covid-19, the 28-day mortality was 22%. 10 It is important to note that only 1 of 199 patients in that trial were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline. In case series and cohort studies, largely from China, mortality rates of 17 to 78% have been reported in severe cases, defined by the need for admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or both. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] For example, among 201 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, mortality was 22% overall and 66% (44 of 67) among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 By way of comparison, the 13% mortality observed in this remdesivir compassionate-use cohort is noteworthy, considering the severity of disease in this patient population; however, the patients enrolled in this compassionate-treatment program are not directly comparable to those studied in these other re- ports. For example, 64% of remdesivir-treated patients were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline, including 8% who were receiving ECMO, and mortality in this subgroup was 18% (as compared with 5.3% in patients receiving noninvasive oxygen support), and the majority (75%) of patients were male, were over 60 years of age, and had coexisting conditions. Unfortunately, our compassionate-use program did not collect viral load data to confirm the antiviral effects of remdesivir or any association between baseline viral load and viral suppression, if any, and clinical response. Moreover, the duration of remdesivir therapy was not entirely uniform in our study, largely because clinical improvement enabled discharge from the hospital. The effectiveness of a shorter duration of therapy (e.g., 5 days, as compared with 10 days), which would allow the treatment of more patients during the pandemic, is being assessed in ongoing randomized trials of this therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2354, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2355, "end": 2359, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2364, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2369, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2374, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "No new safety signals were detected during short-term remdesivir therapy in this compassionate-use cohort.

Nevertheless, other factors may have contributed to differences in outcomes, including the type of supportive care (e.g., concomitant medications or variations in ventilatory practices) and differences in institutional treatment protocols and thresholds for hospitalization. Moreover, the use of invasive ventilation as a proxy for disease severity may be influenced by the availability of ventilators in a given location.
