Long-term ageing resistance and healing properties of pavement materials were discussed in detail. The ageing characteristics of asphalt materials during their service life were evaluated by Wang et al. [10] , which made them differ from ageing research on the lab-aged materials. Rejuvenators were designed by Zhang et al. [11] and Su et al. [12] using petroleum technology and encapsulating rejuvenator fiber, and then added into recycled pavement material and lab-aged material. They concluded that rejuvenators can soften aged pavement materials and consequently recover the road performance. Furthermore, self-healing characteristics of pavement materials were reported by Wu et al. [13] , Li et al. [14] , and Cai et al. [15] . Wu et al. [13] found that UV irradiation will weaken the macro-structure and lower the failure strength and healing index. Li et al. [14] designed steel fiber modified asphalt concrete to promote the induction heating technology, while Cai et al. [15] used engineered cementitious composites mortar to prepare flexible pavement materials with certain healing property. Numerical simulation models of microwave heating of asphalt mixture, which can be used for pavement maintenance, recycling, and deicing, were developed with finite element software by Wang et al. [16] .",

Performance studies on stress absorbing membrane interlayer and semi-flexible composite mixture were discussed by Yang et al. [24] and Zhang et al. [25] . The former article investigated the phase transition characteristics by dynamic mechanical analysis, while the second article presented the engineering properties by means of thermal cracking, fatigue, rutting resistance, and moisture resistance. Asphalt-based materials are composed of binder, filler, and aggregates, and the interaction between each different compound is the key to get a better understanding of pavement performance. The effect of aggregate meso-structure on the permanent deformation of asphalt mixture was discussed by Zhang et al. [26] , with the three-dimensional discrete element model. Their model can capture the aggregate morphologies of angularity, orientation, and surface texture. Chen et al. [27] investigated the asphalt-filler/aggregate interaction on self-designed interface specimens with dynamic shear rheometer. They concluded that asphalt mortar could be the closest subscale in terms of performance to that of asphalt mixtures, making it a vital scale to bridge the gap between asphalt binder and asphalt mixtures in multiscale performance analysis. A unified strength model, which can be used to overcome the design deviation caused by the randomness of the laboratory strength test and improve the accuracy degree, was described by Xia et al. [28] . Different loading stresses were investigated to conclude the unified strength model, as well as to study the asphalt mixture moduli in the research presented by Fan et al. [29] .",

Cool coating materials for asphalt pavements were designed and discussed by Chen et al. [35] . These studies are critically important for pavement design and highway service. For instance, the cool coating can be widely used to solve the high-temperature-related defects in asphalt pavement.",

Cement concrete and asphalt concrete are the two major materials in pavement engineering, so-called rigid pavement and flexible pavement. The micro-zone corrosion mechanism [36] , cement mortar with super absorbent polymer [37] , and exhaust-purifying cement [38] were discussed in detail. Polypropylene fiber was used in cement concrete and its performance was studied by Chen et al. [39] by dynamic compressive behavior analysis. Last, but not least, Yan et al. [40] presented their excellent work on anti-corrosion property of glass flake, which was designed for the reinforcement in chemically bonding phosphate ceramic coatings. ",
