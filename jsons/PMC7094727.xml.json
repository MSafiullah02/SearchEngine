This area of research started with the Barker hypothesis in the early 1990s, and has since received increasing attention from the medical community, becoming one of the major areas of research in biomedical sciences (Barker, 2007). Over the years, supporting evidences for the DOHaD theory have been accumulated and, gradually, its concepts are influencing public health policies around the world (Barker et al., 2013; Stephenson et al., 2018). It is noteworthy that not only the gestation period, but also the preconception period, have been perceived as critical for pregnancy outcomes and postnatal health of offspring (Stephenson et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In addition to its importance in biomedical sciences, the main concepts of DOHaD seem to be also relevant for livestock, not only to animal health but also to production performance. For instance, there is growing evidence that environmental and maternal characteristics during gestation can influence health, reproduction, and production traits in ruminants (Berry et al., 2008; Opsomer et al., 2016; Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2018; Vonnahme et al., 2018). Nonetheless, multiple research models used to study DOHaD in livestock animals were developed as proof of concept, and not necessarily reflect conditions commonly observed in commercial herds. Thus, more epidemiological studies in large populations are required to establish the importance of prenatal programming in livestock production. Moreover, reliable genetic predictions for production traits are now possible using genomic testing, which could be a useful tool to identify and explain nongenetic variation of important traits and their phenotypic plasticity.",

            "text": "Lactation per se and health status during lactation are 2 major factors that cause changes in oocyte quality and uterine environment and affect reproductive success in dairy cows (Chagas et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008; Bromfield et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016). Lactating cows are generally less fertile than nulliparous heifers, and this association has been considered a consequence of the remarkable nutritional demands imposed by lactation in the modern dairy cow compared with the nutritional demands of a growing heifer (Chagas et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2010). Comparisons between heifers and lactating cows or between lactating and nonlactating cows have showed important differences in overall metabolism and in the biology of the ovaries, the uterus, and pregnancy (Sartori et al., 2004; Wiltbank et al., 2006; Cerri et al., 2012; Maillo et al., 2012; Valour et al., 2014). In addition, a large proportion of lactating cows experience postpartum clinical diseases (i.e., metritis, mastitis, lameness, and digestive and respiratory problems), which have long-term consequences on reproduction (Ribeiro and Carvalho, 2017; Carvalho et al., 2019). Similar to lactation, clinical diseases have consequences for the metabolism of the cow and the biology of ovaries, uterus, and pregnancy, increasing the incidence of reproductive failures (Bromfield et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2013, 2016). Nonetheless, it is still unknown whether lactation and clinical diseases cause any alterations in developmental programming in pregnancies that survive to term.",

Heifers were born in maternity pens with sand bedding, separated from their dam, weighed using a conventional scale, and fed 4 L of colostrum with >70 g/L of IgG during the first 6 h of life. Heifers were then housed in individual elevated pens of approximately 2 m2 placed in an open-side barn. Preweaned heifers received 6 L of pasteurized milk per day and had ad libitum access to water and concentrate feed. Weaning was performed on wk 8 after birth, initially reducing milk feeding to 3 L/d for 3 d and then removing it completely. After weaning, heifers were housed in dry-lot pens in groups of 50 to 100 heifers. Heifers were fed a TMR to meet the nutrient requirements of growing Holstein heifers gaining 0.9 kg of BW/d based on NRC (2001) recommendations. Three weeks before the expected calving date, pregnant heifers were moved to a maternity free-stall barn, which was open-side and equipped with fans, sprinklers, and stalls with sand bedding. At the time of calving, heifers were moved into maternity pens with sand bedding. After calving, primiparous cows were housed separately from herd's multiparous cows in free-stall barns equipped with tunnel ventilation and stalls with sand bedding. Feed was delivered twice a day as a TMR, formulated to meet the nutrient requirements of lactating cows producing 40 kg/d of milk according to the NRC (2001). Cows were milked 3\u00d7/d and yields of milk were recorded at each milking (SmartDairy meter, Boumatic, Madison, WI). Official milk tests of the DHIA were performed monthly. Cows were managed according to standard operating proceedings, and all management procedures were performed by trained personnel and supervised by the herd veterinarians and the Food Animal Reproduction and Medicine Service of the Veterinary College at the University of Florida.",

Approximately 50% of dairy cows have at least one clinical disease by 305 DIM, and the odds of pregnancy per breeding and calving per breeding in these cows are reduced substantially because of failures in fertilization and postfertilization survival of the developing pregnancy (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Carvalho et al., 2019). Most cases of clinical diseases occur in the first 3 wk of lactation, thus weeks before the first postpartum breeding. Even though the vast majority of cows are clinically healthy at time of breeding and throughout gestation, health problems that occur in the early postpartum period seem to have enduring consequences for ovaries and uterus that ultimately impair conceptus development and survival (Bromfield et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Carvalho et al., 2019).",

In this study, we investigated whether the reported effects of clinical diseases on reproductive biology would be extended to the postnatal life of pregnancies that survive to term, influencing health and performance of the offspring. Interestingly, daughters of cows that had clinical diseases in the lactation when the pregnancy was generated had reduced incidence of clinical diseases as a young heifer and as a first-lactation cow, indicating that the health status of the dam could affect the disease susceptibility of the offspring. According to the DoHaD theory, prenatal programming might represent evolutionary strategies to improve the chances of survival in a hostile environment, also known as a predictive adaptive response (Gluckman et al., 2005). Thus, the altered uterine environment of cows that had clinical diseases might induce adaptive changes in the conceptus that could improve its resilience or tolerance to postnatal health challenges and consequently improve chances of survival.",

Heifers born from cows that had disease and those born from cows that did not have disease were similar in size at birth, and had similar milk production in the first lactation, which are 2 important factors associated with susceptibility to diseases. Nevertheless, prenatal programming of the immune system could be a possible explanation. Williams et al. (2011) performed an immunological challenge with LPS in female mice shortly after breeding to induce inflammation when the zygotes were being generated, and then compared those with a control group that was not challenged. The same LPS challenge was performed in the offspring of challenged and not challenged dams, and the inflammatory response was reduced in mice whose dams were challenged at the time of conception. In addition, the LPS challenge of the dam caused a reduction in the blastocyst inner cell mass, as well as the ratio of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells (Williams et al., 2011). Thus, inflammatory responses of the dam might affect not only the development of the conceptus in utero but might also result in postnatal adaptations in pregnancies that survive to term. Interestingly, preimplantation conceptus recovered from cows that had disease before AI presented upregulation of genes associated with inflammatory response, and inflammatory molecules such as LPS, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 were predicted as potential upstream regulators of such differences.",

In fact, the modern high-producing dairy cow has remarkable nutrient demands, with total requirements averaging 4 times the maintenance requirements (Chagas et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2010). As a consequence, metabolism and endocrinology are drastically different between lactating and nonlactating cows or between lactating cows and nonlactating heifers, and include differences in circulating levels of glucose, insulin, IGF-1, nonesterified fatty acids, and steroid hormones, which affect the biology of reproductive tissues (Sartori et al., 2004; Wiltbank et al., 2006; Cerri et al., 2012; Maillo et al., 2012; Valour et al., 2014).

In addition to lactation, the comparison also included differences in environment, management, diet, and age of the dams. But considering that all daughters were managed equally and in the same environment, the comparison is still relevant to understand how major differences in dam biology could influence health and performance of daughters. Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of primiparous cows were smaller at birth and less likely to die, to be sold, or to leave the herd as a heifer. The difference in sales is likely explained by the fact that daughters of primiparous cows had greater GEBV for production traits and, thus, were more likely to be retained in the dairy. However, the differences in mortality are likely explained by better resilience of daughters of primiparous cows, which could be a consequence of developmental programming in utero.

It is not clear how the developmental programming in utero could improve reproduction and resilience to diseases, but based on biomedical research, differences in nutrient delivery in utero could affect tissue formation and future phenotypic plasticity of important traits (Fleming et al., 2015). In laboratory animals and humans, age of the mother was reported to be inversely associated with fitness, reproduction, and lifespan of the offspring (Bock et al., 2019), which supports our findings and indicates that the underpinning mechanism associated with the observed variations in phenotypes of daughters might be linked to the age of the dam and not necessarily to metabolism of the dam.",

In fact, when we included the GEBV in the statistical models, milk production of daughters of primiparous cows were actually less than that observed for daughters of multiparous cows. Similar results were reported previously in heifers derived from ET (Siqueira et al., 2017), indicating that the uterine environment during embryonic and fetal development might be responsible for such difference in milk production of first-lactation cows. The specific reason for such phenotypic plasticity, which can be considered undesirable from a production standpoint, is unclear, but might be related to developmental programming of metabolism and nutrient partition, or mammary gland development, or simply differences in body size of daughters. Valour et al. (2014) compared preimplantation conceptuses recovered from lactating cows and nulliparous heifers, and although no morphological differences were observed, 483 transcripts were differently expressed and revealed important differences in lipid and energy metabolism. Whether those differences are sustained to later stages of gestation and whether they influence metabolic programing in utero remain unknown. Swali and Wathes (2007) reported that daughters of primiparous cows had greater weight loss and reduced concentration of IGF-1 in blood during the early postpartum period after first calving compared with daughters of multiparous cows. In the same study, daughters of primiparous also had reduced concentration of insulin in blood between 8 and 12 wk of lactation compared with daughters of multiparous cows.",

Previous research has reported similar differences in body size according to parity of the dam and similar associations of BW at birth with milk production in the first lactation (Swali and Wathes, 2006, 2007; Kamal et al., 2014; Siqueira et al., 2017; Vieira-Neto et al., 2017). Swali and Wathes (2007), however, reported that differences in body size were no longer apparent by 3 mo of age. The lighter birth weight of daughters of primiparous cows is at least partially explained by the observed shorter gestation length. However, the smaller body size at birth could also be a result of distinct placentation and nutrient availability at late gestation, or even potential differences in sire selection for breeding of heifers. Most fetal growth occurs at late gestation and requires large amounts of nutrients (Bell, 1995). At late stages of gestation, heifers are still growing in size and other body tissues will compete with the pregnant uterus for nutrients. On the other hand, parous cows are normally dried off at late gestation and there is little competition for nutrients with the mammary gland. Thus, protein and energy densities in the diet of pregnant heifers at late gestation should be adjusted to provide adequate level of nutrients and energy for proper fetal and mother growth.",

Environmental factors such as nutrition and stressors have already been shown to have effects on epigenetic marks in multiple tissues and were associated with distinct phenotypes of the offspring (Chavatte-Palmer et al., 2018; Skibiel et al., 2018). Differences in epigenetics result in changes of gene expression and biology of tissues, which ultimately can affect the observed phenotypes. Thus, all the associations between maternal characteristics and offspring performance discussed above could represent developmental programming of heifers potentially mediated by epigenetic changes. A better understanding of these events and their associated biological mechanisms could lead to novel management strategies in livestock and further optimization of animal health and production.",

Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of primiparous cows were born after a shorter gestation, were lighter at birth, had greater genetic merit for production traits, were less likely to die, to be sold, and to have late pregnancy losses as a heifer, were less likely to have postpartum clinical diseases and, when genetic merit for production was considered, had reduced lactation performance as a first-lactation cow. Compared with daughters of multiparous cows that did not have clinical diseases in the previous lactation, daughters of multiparous cows that had at least one clinical disease in the previous lactation were less likely to have diarrhea as a young heifer, less likely to have postpartum clinical diseases as a first lactation cow, but were more likely to be sold and to leave the herd as a heifer, even though the genetic merit for production traits were similar.",
