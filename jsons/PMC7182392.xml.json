Rather than provide the absolute, row search figures for statistical analyses, Google Trends present the relative search volume (RSV) instead. The data collected from Google Trends is adjusted to the time and location, so the comparisons between queries can be easier.

To better analysis public awareness of this issue, we use the following search terms \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cCorona Virus Disease 2019\u201d (which were most searched) to investigate public awareness of COVID-19 in six major English-speaking countries from both hemispheres. Additionally, plus sign (+) which means \u201cOR\u201d was used to represent the combination of those multiple terms. These queries were searched from 2019/12/31 to 2020/02/24 within the countries from the Northern hemisphere, including the USA, the UK, Canada and Ireland as well as countries from the Southern hemisphere, including Australia and New Zealand. These countries were selected because they reflect the major native English-speaking countries in both hemispheres, and the searches were conducted on the 28th February 2020. For the purpose of comparing the difference of public response to the topic about COVID-19 across countries, we defined two novel definitions to make the comparisons easier: response time and duration of public attention. Response time refers to the time between the day when WHO received the report, and to the first day when the RSV started to occur. While the duration of public attention refers to the time between the day when RSV started to occur to the day it reached the apex (time points at both ends were included in response time and duration of public attention). To analysis the difference between the Northern and Southern hemisphere, we get the data which represent the RSV related to COVID-19 in the Northern hemisphere by adding up the daily RSV in the USA, the UK, Canada and Ireland. Using the same way, we get the data in the Southern hemisphere by combining the daily RSV in Australia and New Zealand. Besides, since the RSV in the United States is less than \u201c1\u201d for several days, we treated it as RSV equal to \u201c1\u201d in these days for better reflecting the American response to COVID-19.",

Since the cardinal number cannot be zero, we take the first day when RSV is not zeroing as the baseline. In addition, you can get the increment rate by decreasing the development rate by 100%.

The highest increment speed in New Zealand and Ireland occurred later than that in the United States, the UK, Canada and Australia. In addition, people in the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada had a faster response speed than that in Ireland and New Zealand. Moreover, the duration of public attention in the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada was longer than that in Ireland and New Zealand. Our results also suggest that RSV for the topic of COVID-19 in most countries was slightly positively correlated with the number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China and the cases confirmed with COVID-19 in other countries (besides China). In addition, people from different countries presented various interests to the RSV related to COVID-19, and people\u2019s attention to COVID-19 was also different in various sub-regions within each country. Some reasons may contribute to our results.",

However, other countries did not pay much attention to SARS-CoV-2 until the National Health Commission of China has listed SARS-CoV-2 as class B infectious disease and treated as Class A for infection prevention and control management on th 20th January 2020 [9]. This indicates this novel coronavirus can be a severe threat to public health. This may be a reason that the search trends about COVID-19 reached the highest increment speed near the 20th January 2020. Besides, the first confirmed case with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by the WHO in the USA, and Australia is on the 21st January 2020 and the 25th January 2020, respectively [9]. Coincidentally, the day when the second-highest increment speed occurred is exactly the day when the first infected case was reported. Also, the first peak value of the RSV regarding COVID-19 in Canada occurred on the 25th January 2020, while the first confirmed case was also reported on the same day. According to the WHO\u2019s report on the 30th January 2020 that the outbreak of COVID-19 meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEC). Which indicates that this epidemic may not only post a severe threat to the health and well-being of Chinese people, but may have also posed stress on the economy of the whole world. So, the summit of RSV occurred around the 31st January 2020 in most countries from both hemispheres. The peak value of RSV regarding COVID-19 in the UK occurred on the 31st January 2020 may also because of the first confirmed case within the UK was reported on that day. Also, until the 24th February 2020, there were no confirmed cases had been reported in Ireland and New Zealand, which may contribute to the highest increment speed in Ireland and New Zealand occurred later than the other four countries. Besides, the response time in Ireland and New Zealand was also longer than that in other countries, which indicates the public in these countries had a lower vigilance to COVID-19 compared with people in the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada. The official names of the novel coronavirus and diseases caused by this virus were confirmed on th e11th Feb 2020, which may lead to the emergence of the second apex for RSV about COVID-19. Besides, the first cluster of passengers detected negatively of SARS-CoV-2, began leaving the Diamond Princess and back to their own countries on th e19th February 2020. Thus, people\u2019s interest in COVID-19 increased again from the 19th February 2020, and with the case number soaring worldwide, the search trend keeps increasing.",

The health care system within the United States plays a critical role in enhancing public awareness toward health-related issues. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), multiple other federal and local agencies, as well as other partners and health departments have implemented robust methods to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in the USA [21,22]. Besides, according to the statistics from the WHO and CDC that up to more than 19 million people have been diagnosed with influenza in America, with more than 10 thousand fatalities as of the 25th January 2020. So, the public in America may be more sensitive to the topic regarding COVID-19 than in other countries. According to Matt Hancock, England\u2019s health secretary, that England has a world-leading infection control procedure [23]. Before the first confirmed cases had been found in England, Britain had done enough \u201cself-isolation\u201d measures, in case of the possible transmission of COVID-19 in the UK. According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)\u2019s plan for the evacuation of overseas Chinese, 83 British citizens in Wuhan had flown back to the UK on January 31 and been isolated for 14 days at a military base in Oxfordshire, UK [24]. Which confirmed that the infection-control procedures in the UK are advanced. Besides, Australia had also implemented many measures, including denied the people who had left or transited through mainland China gets into Australia, to slow the spread of COVID-19 into Australia and to prepare health care laboratories and services for a timely response [25]. However, as of the 24th February 2020, the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Canada (10 cases) was lower than in the USA (35 cases), the UK (13 cases) and Australia (22 cases) [9]. This may be an explanation of why the public response time in Canada was longer, and the duration of public attention was shorter than that in the USA, the UK and Australia. In addition, since the first reported case of COVID-19 in Canada, presenting as mild pneumonia, which may, to some extent, reduce the public\u2019s vigilance to this newly virus [26]. Besides, according to previous research in China, the average duration of netizens\u2019 attention to social events is around 21 days [27]. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 meets the criteria for a PHEC, the duration of public attention toward ARS-CoV-2 should be longer. However, the duration of public attention in the countries contained in our study was not very long, particularly in Ireland and New Zealand. During the earlier period of observing time, all the countries contained in our study did not present too much attention to COVID-19, which may contribute to the global outbreak of COVID-19 in recent days. Which reminds us that when facing public health emergencies, governments should strengthen the publicity of these issues, shorten the response time to deal with major emergencies, improve the public's vigilance and sensitivity, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, so as to minimize the loss of the masses.",

Moreover, similar to the symptoms of influenza, the most common symptoms for patients confirmed with COVID-19 are fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, some have a headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea [29]. So, most people searched the term \u201ccoronavirus symptoms\u201d on Google, afraid of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the most relative searched terms in the USA, the UK, Canada, and New Zealand were \u201ccoronavirus new york\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus uk\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus canada\u201d and \u201cnew zealand coronavirus\u201d, respectively, which may due to that people cared more about the epidemic of the COVID-19 in their own countries. Besides, people from Canada also had a great interest in the term regarding \u201clunar new year\u201d. Since it has been discovered that COVID-19 can transmit from human to human [30], the Spring Festival travel rush during Chinese New Year can lead to further spread of this newly coronavirus.

According to the population statistics report from different countries, the areas with the largest distribution of Chinese were: New York, New Jersey in the United States [31]; England in the UK [32]; Ontario, British Columbia in Canada [33]; New South Wales, Victoria in Australia [34]; Auckland in New Zealand [35]. Interestingly, all the regions with the largest distribution of Chinese presented a higher interest to the topic regarding COVID-19, which suggests that the distribution of RSV for \u201c2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019\u201d may associate with the distribution of Chinese within regions. Moreover, our results also indicate that sub-regions in the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia with a higher awareness regarding COVID-19 are places with the developed economy, dense population and developed transportation system. On the contrary, the public in Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, places in the northwest of Canada with a sparse population, did not present too much attention to the topic regarding SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, Otago, a sub-region with higher awareness regarding SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand, is world-famous because of its tourist city- Queenstown. According to the WHO\u2019s report that most people confirmed with COVID-19 in other countries had the history of traveling in Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of tourism in different sub-regions may also affect the public awareness of COVID-19. Besides, according to a previous study\u2019s report, as of 8 February 2020, the confirmed cases in Australia were found in New South Wales (4 cases), Victoria (4 cases), Queensland (5 cases) and Southern Australia (2 cases) [25]. The public in all the regions presented a higher interest in the topic regarding SARS-CoV-2. So, the confirmed cases within the regions may also affect our results. However, further studies are required to confirm these hypotheses. Since the distribution of the public with a higher awareness of COVID-19 was centralized, people in other places did not pay enough attention to COVID-19. Therefore, governments in all countries are required to strengthen the propaganda of COVID-19 nationally, so as to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 globally.",
