            "text": "Influenza A (H1N1) virus belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, the species of influenza A (H1N1) virus. The typical virus particle is an enveloped sphere with a diameter of 80\u2013120 nm. On the envelope, there are many glycoprotein protrusions arrayed radially, including column-like hemagglutinin (HA), mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein M2. A symmetrically spiral nucleocapsid is inside the virus envelope, with a diameter of 10 nm and ringlike structures in both ends. As a new mutant, influenza A (H1N1) virus is a single-negative-stranded RNA with a genome weighing about 13.6 kb. The virus strain of influenza A (H1N1) is the result of recombined eight gene fragments of influenza virus in different sizes, including HI, NP, and NS from classical swine influenza virus, PB2 and PA from avian influenza virus in North America, PB1 from human influenza A (H3N2) virus, and N1 and M from swine influenza virus in Europe and Asia. A scholarly study on ferret models was reported to have findings that influenza A (H1N1) virus is more pathogenic than seasonal influenza virus because it survives in the small intestine while seasonal influenza virus fails to. Influenza A (H1N1) virus is sensitive to common disinfectants such as ethanol, iodophor, and tincture of iodine and can be inactivated by oxidant, olefin acid, halogen compounds, and calcium oxychloride. Influenza A (H1N1) virus is heat intolerable, which can be inactivated at a temperature of 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. Its infectivity can be rapidly destructed by direct sunlight for 40\u201348 h or ultraviolet radiation.",

After its infection to the human body, it can replicate in epithelial cells of the whole respiratory tract to invade bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar epithelial cells in large quantities. The hemagglutinin binds to the sialic acid on the surface of cells to invade the cells, with following replication of genetic materials in a large quantity to produce viral proteins. The cell membrane envelopes the genetic materials of the virus and viral protein, giving rise to another sphere from the cell-like budding. The new virus adheres to the cell via the bond between hemagglutinin and sialic acid. After that, neuraminidase hydrolyzes the sialic acid to release the new virus from its host cell and the released new virus can invade another cell. By autopsy of the death cases from influenza A (H1N1), the pathological examination of the pulmonary tissues demonstrated extensive epithelial degeneration and necrosis of bronchi and bronchioles as well as exudates containing neutrophils and monocytes filling the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. The critical factors determining the onset and development of influenza A (H1N1) include the loading dose of influenza A (H1N1) virus, the intrapulmonary infiltration of the inflammatory cells, and the release of inflammatory mediators. The early animal studies about influenza A (H1N1) virus collected in 1918 have demonstrated infiltration of large quantities of neutrophils and macrophages in rat pulmonary tissues, waterfall-like releases of enzymes and cytokines (including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-2) by inflammatory cells, and mutually enhanced pathological effects by cytokines and inflammatory cells. Consequently, pulmonary lesions, pulmonary dysfunction, decreased body weight, and general fatigue occur. The studies on animals inoculated with HA DNA influenza virus vaccine indicated that the increase of released IFN-\u03b3 is more than the released IL-4 and the replication of influenza A (H5N1) virus declines, both of which have quantity-effect relationship with the amount of vaccines. These findings indicated that the immune reactions against influenza virus infection have bias on Th cellular immune reactions and the production of cytokine Th2 is related to large quantity replications of influenza virus. By clinical trials, it has been found that strong cytokine IRF-3 reaction can reduce IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, and MCP-1 and partially reduce TNF-\u03b1, which is related to the severity of influenza A (H5N1) symptoms and viral replication. Recent studies have demonstrated that the virus-induced cytokine (IFN, TNF-\u03b1) reactions are even weaker than seasonal influenza despite the differences of genotypes and antigenicity between influenza A (H1N1) and seasonal influenza. The relationship between the weaker virus-induced cytokine reactions and mild clinical manifestations of influenza A (H1N1) remains elusive.",

Necrotizing tracheobronchitis occurs following the shedding of ciliated columnar epithelium in the bronchi, with ulcerations and shedding of bronchial mucosa. There are alveolar capillary congestion and alveolar hemorrhage, with the alveolar lumens filled with liquid exudates of fibrins. Alveolar edema and fusion of substantial lobular inflammatory exudates occur in alveoli lined with transparent pneumonocytic membrane. With the progress of the conditions, pulmonary interstitial tissues are involved, with reduced alveolar gas content, pulmonary consolidation, and fibrosis.

The pathological changes include diffuse cerebral edema, vascular lesions, and necrosis, without obvious perivascular demyelination. In the necrotic area, the necrotic cells are demonstrated with illusive shadows. In the background of rare cells and swollen nerve fiber network, karyopyknosis or fragments of karyolysis and erythrocytic exudation can be found, with no astrocytes and hyperplasic microglia. Ischemic atrophy and pericellular edema are found in many neurons in the cortex of the cerebrum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem. Thrombosis is found in some minor blood vessels of the brainstem. Diffuse ischemic change of neurons and thrombosis in the brainstem and cerebellar pyramid are pathological changes secondary to cerebral edema. (c) There is a 110 \u03bcmm blood vessel in the head of the left caudate nucleus. In addition, exudation of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as karyolysis with/without accompanying intraluminal thrombosis can be found in the vascular wall with FVL and perivascular space. (d) Martius scarlet blue staining demonstrates fibrin reservoir in the blood vessels (Note: The case and images are from Ng WF, et al. Brain Pathol. 2010;20(1):261)",
