Although most infections with human coronavirus are mild, two coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5, 6] , cause severe infection. They can cause fulminant disease and severe illness. In December 2019, a new coronavirus named 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was found in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The disease caused by this coronavirus is COVID-19 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . At present, many cases have been confirmed in all provinces of China and in other countries. For making the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19, it is a great challenge for doctors to determine the condition of patients with severe illness as early as possible.",

In our study, 45 patients were tested for serum HFABP from the day of admission to the 5th day of admission, and one patient was tested for serum HFABP on the 6th day of admission. In addition, 2 critically severe COVID-19 patients died during hospitalization. Three COVID-19 patients with serum HFABP-positive result changed from mild to severe state during hospitalization. Demographic and disease characteristics of 15 patients with serum HFABP-positive COVID-19 and 30 patients with serum HFABP-negative COVID-19 are presented in Table 1 . The results of HFABP analysis showed a normal distribution, with values decreasing from 1.76 ng/mL to 24.68 ng/mL (mean 6.81, 95% CI 5.23-8.40, SD 5.33).

This virus can utilize human receptors and has the potential to replicate in human cells. 2019-nCoV has the potential to cause a pandemic, and it is still being studied in depth to prevent it from becoming a global health threat. Reliable and rapid differential diagnosis and reasonable treatment of diagnosed patients with COVID-19 are still essential to control the epidemic [15, 16] . Our study screened 46 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19. The patient was severe viral pneumonia and was fatal. All patients were sent to Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital before February 22, 2020, and their clinical symptoms were very similar to SARS. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in severe patients, and they will require admission to the Intensive Care Unit and assistant treatment with mechanical ventilation. During the retrospective study, 2 of 46 patients included in this research died (4.3%); thus, the mortality of COVID-19 was very high.",

Therefore, elevated serum HFABP can be used as an indicator of severe COVID-19 and an independent risk factor for patient prognosis. Among the patients in this study, 40 patients were monitored for troponin T, and only 6 patients were positive for troponin T; however, there was no statistical difference between the serum HFABP-negative and HFABP-positive groups. The hypothesis that HFABP is affected by troponin T does not hold, and the serum HFABP levels show an independent stable performance. This can happen because, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, novel coronavirus infections also induce the secretion of a large number of cytokines [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , leading to inflammatory lung injury, which reduces blood oxygen concentration and puts myocardial cells in a hypoxic state, thereby increasing the release of HFABP into the blood. We noted that 86.7% of patients with elevated serum HFABP are patients with severe COVID-19; therefore, it is of great significance to judge and predict the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19. At present, there is no objective laboratory index for assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Serum HFABP can be used as an effective index; thus, it can guide the clinicians to judge patients with severe COVID-19 in the short term, and elevated HFABP can also severely affect the outcome of patients with COVID-19.",
