Viruses that infect archaeal organisms have been less well studied. Bacteriophages are rapidly evolving and have been shown to outnumber their hosts 10 to 1, thereby applying constant evolutionary pressure.22 Bacteriophages are classified by the nature of their nucleic acid and virion morphology. There are 2 broad categories: the tailed, double-stranded DNA viruses of the order Caudovirales (families Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae) and the nontailed, cubic or filamentous viruses, which are largely composed of single-stranded DNA viruses (family Microviridae).23 The Caudovirales and Microviridae are the most abundant bacteriophages in the human gut, although several other bacteriophages are readily detected.24 GI bacteriophages have not been completely cataloged, but studies have shown the extreme diversity of these populations.3, 25\n",

Of the sequences similar to reference bacteriophages, more than 80% were from temperate prophages and members of the Siphoviridae family, and the remainder largely consisted of other Caudovirales and Microviridae. To date, the fecal virome studies in healthy subjects have led to several important observations: (1) there is little intrapersonal variation in bacteriophages, (2) there is a high degree of interpersonal variation in bacteriophages, even among genetically related subjects, (3) temperate bacteriophages are prevalent, (4) the diversity of bacteriophages increases in adulthood, and (5) diet affects the bacteriophage community structure.3, 24, 25, 32 Furthermore, antibiotic resistance gene annotations were observed in VLP preparations from mice given antibiotics.33 Enrichment of VLPs and modern sequencing technologies allow for investigation of virome diversity at an unprecedented level and will be valuable for studies of host-associated viromes.",

In the circulation, bacteriophages would be readily available for immune detection; they are known to induce humoral immune responses.40, 41 Additionally, bacteriophages have been reported to have adjuvant-like effects during virus infection of eukaryotic cells42 and to stimulate cytokine production by macrophages in vitro.43 Furthermore, bacteriophage capsid proteins adhere to mucin glycoproteins,44 putting them in proximity with the intestinal epithelium, where they might interact with the immune system.

The issue of persistence of these viruses has been understudied, but a significant proportion of apparently healthy subjects may shed certain \u201cpathogenic\u201d enteric eukaryotic viruses. For example, noroviruses may be shed for extended periods and can be the source of outbreaks of disease among those exposed to the carrier.50, 51, 52, 53, 54 Sequencing of fecal samples from healthy children has revealed a complex community of eukaryotic viruses that includes picobirnaviruses, adenoviruses, anelloviruses, astroviruses, bocaviruses, enteroviruses, rotaviruses, and sapoviruses.46 A study of RNA viruses in the fecal material of 2 healthy donors revealed 42 viral species, including 35 plant RNA viruses (probably originating from digested food) and human picobirnavirus.55 Picobirnaviruses have been widely detected in stool samples from subjects with diarrhea of unknown etiology,56, 57, 58 in healthy subjects,46 and in livestock,59 although the pathogenic potential of picobirnaviruses is unclear. The detection of these viruses in humans indicates that many viruses capable of infecting eukaryotic cells reside within the human GI tract.",

The viruses identified included new astroviruses, picobirnaviruses, caliciviruses, nodaviruses, and anelloviruses.57 These findings show that the human GI tract is colonized by a diverse set of viruses during early stages of development in healthy infants and those with diseases. The role of these viruses on the development and function of the immune system, as well as the overall generation of a healthy or diseased GI tract, requires further study.",

However, it is not clear whether this would be an event that conditions a healthy immune system or a pathogenic process. A recent study of the enteric virome in monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus77 could shed light on the interactions between the GI virome and the immune system. In the study, infection with simian immunodeficiency virus led to expansion of enteric eukaryotic viruses in Rhesus macaques, including picornaviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, circoviruses, and caliciviruses. This virome expansion corresponded with increased gut permeability and ileal epithelial pathology. Interestingly, virome expansion and disease was not observed in simian immunodeficiency virus\u2013infected African green monkeys, which do not develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, suggesting that increased virus shedding, and potentially damage to the intestinal wall, is secondary to immunodeficiency.",

However, a study of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs revealed that the concordance rates for CD and ulcerative colitis were only 35% and 16%, respectively, indicating that environmental factors are major determinants of disease development.81 Intestinal microbiome imbalance, or dysbiosis, is believed to be one important environmental determinant,82 and enteric viruses could be involved.83, 84 A role for enteric virus infection in the pathogenesis of IBD was reported in mice deficient for the IBD susceptibility gene Atg16L1.47 In this study, IBD-like pathology developed in mice with disruptions in Atg16L1 after infection with murine norovirus but not in wild-type mice. Pathology was also dependent on the bacterial composition of the gut, shown by the reversal of virus-induced disease with antibiotic treatment. This finding indicates that a balance of enteric viruses, bacteria, and host genetic factors determine the health of the intestine and that it is important to consider the enteric virome in studies of intestinal diseases.",

These properties have recently been explored using a generalization of the Steven's theorem to identify rare genomes in a mixed sample. Wendl et al127 showed that the expected number of reads covering the target genome increases as the total number of supplied reads increases. For example, for a 50-kilobase target in 0.05% abundance and a 100\u2013base pair read length, we would expect to identify 5 reads aligning to the target with just 18,000 input reads. This number increases as more reads are added, achieving 20 assigned reads with 55,000 input reads and so on. The investigators stated that most of these reads will exist as singletons and contig coverage will only occur as more reads are supplied. Because many reads and contigs in viral metagenomes are unique (they do not match anything in the reference database), the assembly of contigs is a highly desirable goal. Analysis of contig structure and shared contigs between samples has been informative, and until more comprehensive reference databases are generated, contig analysis will likely be the primary method for analysis of viral metagenomes.3, 25, 128\n",

However, we coexist with microbes from all kingdoms of life and the importance of trans-kingdom interactions is becoming increasingly evident. Studies of intestinal health and disease must therefore consider the contributions of microbes from all kingdoms, including the virome and mycobiome. We hope this review brings to light ways to overcome some of the technical hurdles inherent to kingdom-agnostic metagenomics and the importance of a concerted effort to do so. The lessons from the analysis of the bacterial microbiome are profound for all of biology. It is extremely likely that the metagenome as a whole will contain both surprises and unexpected value.",
