            "text": "Active infection surveillance is recognized internationally as one of the activities that contribute to the reduction of the incidence of infections in hospitalized neonates [3\u201312]. Several active surveillance protocols for HAIs in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have been established worldwide, who differs in type of infections/outcomes and/or patients\u2019 population included in the surveillance. In particular, the neonIN network in UK, the Vermont Oxford Network in USA and the Canadian Neonatal Network HAIs surveillance protocols focus mainly on early- and late-onset sepsis, while the NHSN and the NEO-KISS protocols extend surveillance of HAIs to VAPs and HAPs [10, 11]. Also, the majority of HAIs surveillance systems includes all patients\u2019 population of NICUs [4\u20136, 8, 9, 12], while the NEO-KISS system monitors HAIs in infants of BW < 1500 g in NICUs until discharge, until death, or until they reach 1800 g [10, 11]. Moreover, benchmarking of HAIs surveillance protocols in NICUs is available on a national scale for NHSN [4\u20136], NEO-KISS [10, 11], the Vermont Oxford Network [7, 8], the neonIN network [12], and the Canadian Neonatal network [9]. A national framework for the surveillance of HAIs in Italy-SPIN-UTI project is active in Italy since 2008, which involves adult Intensive care units (ICUs) with none of NICUs [13, 14]. Although no surveillance network for HAIs in NICUs is present in Italy, few studies reported the prevalence [15], incidence of HAIs [16\u201320] and epidemics of specific nosocomial pathogens [20\u201324] in selected Italian NICUs.",

Our data showed that HAIs developed in all BW classes, but low BW neonates were at major risk to acquire HAIs [18]. During the surveillance, we observed an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii in the NICU from November 2010 to July 2011, which required the temporary closure of the ward to external admissions of neonates during 2011 [21]. To better understand the risk factors of infection and the impact of prevention activities, we decided to expand our data and compare the results of surveillance of HAIs in the NICU using the NHSN surveillance protocol during 2013\u20132017 and to compare HAIs with those obtained during 2006\u20132010.",

Data are collected from the medical records of the patients every week. The surveillance personnel conduct rounds on the ward to review the results from the laboratory and sometimes from the radiologic findings and to look on the medical records for signs and symptoms of infection, according to the standard definitions. Any clinical issues are directly discussed with caregivers. Data are analyzed on monthly basis and expressed as monthly report. Monthly report consists of patient data, data on swab isolations of sentinel pathogens, device utilization ratios and infection data. All neonates with > 2 days NICU stay enter the AS system and data regarding date of birth, birth weight (BW), gestational age, type of delivery, Apgar score, date of admission in the ward, date of infection, discharge date, type of microorganisms isolated, use of invasive devices (days of central line catheterization, including umbilical catheterization, and invasive ventilation), antimicrobial therapy exposure and infections are collected. The end of the surveillance period coincides with the discharge of the newborn from the ward. Infections are defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions adapted to neonatal pathology [3] and are considered to be health care associated if they develop > 2 days after NICU admission. VAP was defined using CDC criteria for defining nosocomial pneumonia for infants \u2264 1 year old [25]. We exclude neonates with congenital or perinatal infection. This paper analyzes data from the HAIs AS system over a 5 years period (2013\u20132017). For this study purposes, only CLABSI, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and urinary tract infections (UTIs) were considered. Central line-associated blood-stream infections (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were attributed if a central line, including umbilical, catheter and invasive ventilation, respectively, were in place at the time of or within 48 h prior to the development of the infection. The etiology of all infections within each BW class was assessed during the study period. HAIs surveillance was regulated by the Regional Health Authority and it was one of the basic components of the Regional Plan for Healthcare-associated infections Prevention and Control [26]. Results of surveillance activities were periodically reported to the Regional Health Authority.",

Incidence density of device associated infections did not significantly change between the two study periods (6.17 for the first period vs. 5.67 for the second period, p = 0.548). An increase of CLABSI incidence densities per 1000 catheter days, although not significant, was observed during 2013\u20132017 period respect to 2006\u20132010 period (7.16 versus 5.58 p = 0.206), which can be dependent by the increase in the number of patient days and central line utilization in the \u2264750 g BW class in the second study period (Table 4). This finding is in agreement with previous studies showing that bloodstream infections prevailed among HAIs in Italian NICUs [16, 17] and that bloodstream infections were the main infections (45,4%), followed by lower respiratory tract infections (27.8%) and urinary tract infections (15.8%) in Italian and Brazilian PICUs and NICUs [19]. High percentage of bloodstream infections in NICUs has been also reported by NHSN in USA [4], neonINnetwork in UK [12] and worldwide [28\u201331]. Finally, the increase of CLABSI incidence density during 2013\u20132017 in our NICU is alarming because CLABSI rates measure Hospital performance for high-quality patient care [32].",

This might have been dependent on the increase in VAPs in very-low birth weight neonates caused by two outbreaks during 2006\u20132010 period in the NICU [21, 24]. The elevated number of device-associated infections in the NICU strengthen the importance to calculate device utilization rates and use as risk factors for the development of CLABSIs and VAPs according to NHSN surveillance protocol [3\u20135]. Also, in agreement with previous surveillance studies of HAIs in other NICUs [16, 19, 29] and in the same NICU during 2006\u20132010 [18], UTIs were the third most frequent cause of HAIs after CLABSIs and VAPs in our NICU, but decreased from 28.8% [18] to 8.8% during 2013\u20132017.",

During 2013\u20132017, Gram-positive bacteria, in particular CONS (25.3%) and S. aureus (2.3%), were the most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSIs. This finding is in accordance with several reports showing that gram-positive bacteria are the main cause of bloodstream infections in neonates in the NICUs [4, 12, 17, 28\u201330]. Other most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSIs in the NICU were Candida spp., C. parapsilosis (21.8%) and C. albicans (4.6%), P. aeruginosa (5.7%), E. coli (3.4%) and K. pneumoniae (3.4%). During 2013\u20132017, VAPs were most frequently caused by P. aeruginosa (28%), S. maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%). UTIs represented the most frequent device-unrelated infection in the NICU during 2013\u20132017 and were most frequently caused by E. coli (18.18%), K. pneumoniae (18.18%) and Enterobacter spp. (18.18%). The comparison of the etiologies of CLABSIs in the NICU between the two study periods showed a significant higher incidence density of CLABSIs caused by Gram-positive bacteria (p = 0.002) and by undetermined aetiology (p = 0.01) and a significant lower incidence of CLABSIs caused by Candida spp. (p = 0.05) during 2013\u20132017 compared to 2006\u20132010 period. Moreover, a significant lower incidence of VAPs caused by Gram-negative bacteria (p = 0.007) were found during 2013\u20132017 compared to 2006\u20132010 period. The differences in the aetiologies of VAPs and CLABSIs between the two periods could have been due to the occurrence of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii outbreaks in the NICU during the first study period [21, 24]. Moreover, an increase in bloodstream infections caused by C. parapsilosis was observed during 2009\u20132012 in the NICU [22], which might have been responsible for the high incidence of CLABSIs caused by Candida spp. The increase of CLABSIs by undetermined aetiology during 2013\u20132017 it is worrying and without a definite cause.",
