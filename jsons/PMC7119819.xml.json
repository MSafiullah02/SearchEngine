            "text": "Infection of human respiratory tract with different viruses causes diseases with similar signs and symptoms. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients infected with specific respiratory viruses cannot be used to differentiate clearly one virus from another. In this respect, rapid and specific identification of the infecting virus provides many advantages to assist the clinician in making therapeutic decisions, to prevent nosocomial infections, and alert the onset of epidemics. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 cause the vast majority of identified viral respiratory infections in children. These viruses are responsible for a spectrum of acute upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are the major causes of croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in infants and young children. However, these viruses may cause significant morbidity and mortality in adults, especially among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Detecting these viruses will enable to take appropriate measures for the prevention of viral diseases, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic treatment and thus allowing the proper use of antiviral drugs (Corias et al., 2004, Dowell et al., 1996, Henrickson, 2005, Syrmis et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is based on the use of conventional methods such as viral cell culture and indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Although these methods are valuable, they have significant limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Viral cell culture is considered as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for respiratory virus detection, however, the technique is limited due to the prolonged result turnaround time, rapid loss of viability under unsuitable specimen transport and storage conditions (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Liolios et al., 2001, Syrmis et al., 2004). IFAT is a more rapid but less sensitive method than viral cell culture and may be affected by specimen quality, virus type, and incorrect interpretation of results by inexperienced personnel. During the past decade, PCR techniques have improved the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of respiratory viruses. Recently, the development of multiplex PCR assays led to a decrease in expenses and short result turnaround time. In addition, molecular amplification methods do not need viable organisms in contrast to virus cell culture method that requires viable organisms. Multiplex PCR is considered as an advanced method compared to conventional PCR because it detects simultaneously more than one virus in a single reaction (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Corias et al., 2005, Liolios et al., 2001, Syrmis et al., 2004).",

This method is based on the detection of the biotin-labelled PCR amplified products obtained from multiplex PCR assays. Those PCR products bind with high specificity to the complementary sequences of the immobilized oligonucleotide probes arrayed on a nitrocellulose membrane. The arrays were analyzed using a reader (BCS AIM Reader) developed by the manufacturer (bcs Biotech S.p.A., Italy).",

Briefly, 20 \u03bcl amplified PCR product was collected from each tube that contains viral nucleic acid was mixed in a well of an incubation tray. Sixty microliters of denaturing agent was added in to each well, gently mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. One microliters of pre-warmed hybridization buffer was added to each well and strips were transferred to the wells that contain the mixture. The trays that contain the strips were incubated for 30 min at 47 \u00b0C in the shaking water bath (Memmert, PRO Scientific Inc., Germany). Next, the hybridization buffer was discarded and the strips were washed twice quickly with 1 ml pre-warmed wash solution at room temperature on a horizontal shaker provided by the manufacturer. The strips were again washed with 1 ml pre-warmed wash solution for 15 min at 47 \u00b0C in the shaking water bath. The strips were washed twice with Rinse I solution for one min on a horizontal shaker at room temperature. Each strip was incubated with 1 ml conjugate diluted to 1:100 with conjugate buffer for 30 min on a horizontal shaker at room temperature, washed three times 1 ml Rinse II solution for 1 min at room temperature. To visualize the reaction on the strips 1 ml substrate solution was added on to the each strip and incubated in the dark for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by washing the strips twice with 1 ml distilled water. Strips were transferred on to absorbent paper, air dried in the dark For the negative and amplification controls, 20 \u03bcl sample, collected from each groups\u2019 corresponding negative and amplification control tubes, were mixed in two different wells of an incubation tray. Sixty microliters of denaturing agent was added in to each well and CAPvir nitrocellulose strip hybridization method was performed as described above. Therefore, at the end of the assay, three strips that contain viral nucleic acid, negative and amplification controls have been prepared for each specimen. The bands on the strips were analyzed using the supplied template provided by manufacturer (Fig. 2\n).",

Thus, 45 viruses were detected in 40 specimens using shell vial cell culture. The last assay ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected respiratory viruses in 10 specimens in which one of them was dually infected. Eleven respiratory viruses were detected in 10 specimens by ProDect BCS RV CHIP method.

Even though these methods are effective and often complementary, they have some disadvantages. Cell culture techniques are considered traditionally as the \u201cgold standard\u201d during routine diagnosis of viral respiratory agents, however, these methods are laborious and time consuming. Although immunofluorescence antibody tests are easy to perform, antigen detection is less sensitive and specific (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Landry and Ferguson, 2000). Currently, the traditional cell culture and IFAT techniques for the diagnosis and identification of viral respiratory agents are being replaced gradually by molecular techniques such as PCR to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the routine assays and decrease the turnaround time of the result (Corias et al., 2005, Henrickson, 2005, Syrmis et al., 2004). The short result turnover time is very important during a viral outbreak or in the case of a severely infected patient for initiating antiviral therapy on time (Adcock et al., 1997, Corias et al., 2004, Woo et al., 1997). Thus, the present study aimed to compare a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a chip hybridization assay that has 4.5 h result turnaround time to the combination of shell vial cell culture and IFAT that have totally 5 days turnaround time for the result.",

However, the shell vial cell culture used in this study could not detect the RSV in the four cases that have dual infection caused by RSV and parainfluenza virus type 3 but IFAT detected the RSV in these specimens.

Similar to these two studies, the ProDect BCS RV CHIP was also less sensitive in detecting RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3 compared to shell vial cell culture and IFAT. The ProDect BCS RV CHIP used non-structural gene 2, hemagglutinin, and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene regions for the detection of RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3, respectively. ProDect BCS RV CHIPs gene regions for the detection of RSV and adenovirus were used for the first time in literature. Therefore, the reason for the low sensitivity obtained while detecting RSV and adenovirus by ProDect BCS RV CHIP might be due to the selection of primer gene regions different than the studies described previously that have high sensitivity for these viruses.",

            "text": "\nPuppe et al. (2004) reported low sensitivity (23%) for parainfluenza virus type 3 using 5\u2032 non-coding region of the fusion protein gene region in a multiplex RT-PCR ELISA method compared to traditional diagnostic assays. The previous studies that detected parainfluenza virus type 3 with high sensitivity used mainly hemagglutinin-neuraminidase or nucleocapsid gene regions during multiplex RT-PCR (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Corias et al., 2005, Liolios et al., 2001, Syrmis et al., 2004). ProDect BCS RV CHIP also used hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene region for the detection of parainfluenza virus type 3, however, it was less sensitive compared to the combination of shell vial cell culture and IFAT. In order to investigate the technical problems such as sampling error, loss of RNA during extraction or degradation of RNA that might cause ProDect BCS RV CHIPs low sensitivity in detecting of parainfluenza virus type 3, CAPvir assay was applied to randomly selected 10 specimens which were parainfluenza virus type 3 positive with shell vial cell culture and negative with ProDect BCS RV CHIP assay. As a result, CAPVir detected all of the parainfluenza virus type 3 positive specimens that were not detected with the ProDect BCS RV CHIP, which eliminated the presence of technical problems described above. Another parameter that can cause the decrease in sensitivity might be the selection of primer gene regions different than the recommended ones. However, the CAPvir and ProDect BCS RV CHIP use the recommended nucleocapsid and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene regions, respectively, for the detection of parainfluenza virus type 3. Another parameter that is important during the application of multiplex RT-PCR is the large number of primer sets combined in a single reaction that can hamper the sensitivity of the assay (Syrmis et al., 2004). Interestingly, the studies that reported high sensitivity in detecting respiratory viruses by the multiplex RT-PCR and the ProDect BCS RV CHIP used a high number of primer sets combined in a single reaction except the multiplex RT-PCR developed and CAPvir which used low number of primer in three sets of primer mixes (both methods mixed primers of parainfluenza virus types in a tube) that contain low number of prime sets (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Corias et al., 2005, Liolios et al., 2001, Syrmis et al., 2004). Inadequate optimization of large number of primer sets in a single reaction might be causing the low sensitivity of the ProDect BCS RV CHIP in detecting parainfluenza virus type 3. Although the ProDect BCS RV CHIP has decreased sensitivity during routine laboratory use as described above, it has high PPV and specificity because of the absence of cross-reactions with other viruses and false positive results.",
