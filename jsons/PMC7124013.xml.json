Zoonosis comes from the Greek words \u201czoon\u201d and \u201cosis,\u201d which represent \u201canimal\u201d and \u201cill,\u201d respectively. In a systematic review of 1,415 species of pathogens known to infect humans, 868 (61 %) were zoonotic. Unfortunately, the majority of emerging infectious diseases over the last three decades have been zoonotic (Taylor et al. 2001). Most zoonoses are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity, such as henipavirus (Marsh and Wang 2012), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and influenza virus (swine-origin H1N1 or avian influenza H5N1) (Tseng 2007). The major factor influencing the appearance of novel zoonotic diseases in the human population is increased contact between humans and wildlife, such as (i) encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas and (ii) movement of wild animals into areas of human activity (Daszak et al. 2001).",

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a bioterrorism attack is the intentional release of biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, rickettsial or chlamydial organisms, toxins, or other harmful agents that cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants (Balali-Mood et al. 2013). These biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or food. The intended use of biological agents might target humans directly or might be used to disrupt an economy. The disease caused by anthrax was directed at animal populations as early as World War I. Glanders, a virulent disease in horses and mules, was used in the 1910s. Typhoid was reported in a water supply in the 1970s. In September and October 2001, several cases of anthrax occurred in the United States. Letters laced with infectious anthrax were concurrently delivered to the US Congress and news media offices (Spencer 2007).",

            "text": "Anthrax is one of the oldest known animal diseases and has been encountered since antiquity. The first documented used of anthrax as a weapon was in the 1910s during World War I. The most recent event of bioterrorism was in the United States in 2001, which resulted in five deaths (Spencer 2007). The causative pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, is an aerobic Gram-positive rod bacterium. It produces highly resistant spores that are stable when the vegetative form of the organism circulates in the blood during disease. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects wild and domesticated herbivorous animals that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. The most common natural infection route in humans is cutaneous. However, spores may cause disease through inhalation or through the ingestion of contaminated animal products. The most common clinical manifestation is cutaneous anthrax, followed by respiratory anthrax and gastrointestinal anthrax (Balali-Mood et al. 2013; Waterer and Robertson 2009). The neurological symptoms of anthrax infection are usually at a later stage and are part of an established systemic disease (Donaghy 2006). There are no risks of person-to-person spread. For people exposed to anthrax, 60 days of an oral antibiotic is recommended to prevent development of the disease (Waterer and Robertson 2009). Vaccination against anthrax is available and appears to be safe. However, the overall efficacy for preventing anthrax in stockpersons is 92.5 % (Inglesby et al. 2002).",

More recent bioterrorism using plague occurred in World War II (Spencer 2007). The causative pathogen, Yersinia pestis, is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, nonmotile, coccobacilli, nonspore-forming bacterium that was discovered by Yersin in 1984 to be transmitted by rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) (Balali-Mood et al. 2013; Stenseth et al. 2008). There are three syndromes of human plague: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. Most cases are in the bubonic form, which is a rapidly progressing, serious illness with a mortality rate of 40\u201370 %. Y. pestis is highly contagious from person to person and is transmitted by droplets of respiratory secretions. Plague is endemic in many regions such as the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Currently, more than 90 % of all plague cases are reported in Africa (Stenseth et al. 2008). Early antibiotic therapy is essential to reduce the risk of complications and death. Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated to avoid aerosol transmission. Fortunately, unlike anthrax, Y. pestis does not form spores and does not survive well outside the body of the host (Waterer and Robertson 2009).",

Both viruses belong to the family Filoviridae, which causes severe disease in humans and nonhuman primates. The Filoviridae family is classified within the order Mononegavirales, together with the Bornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae families. The genome of all viruses under the order Mononegavirales consists of a linear, non-segmented, single-strand RNA molecule. Filovirus hemorrhagic fevers are typical zoonotic diseases that are transmitted accidentally through direct contact with infected animals. The role of wildlife species in the human epidemiology of filovirus is only partly understood. Several Zaire Ebola virus outbreaks occurred when hunters handled the infected carcasses of nonhuman primates and duiker (Colebunders and Borchert 2000); outbreaks may also be associated with exposure to fruit bats (Calisher et al. 2006; Leroy et al. 2011). The fruit bats Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata represent possible Ebola reservoirs in Africa (Leroy et al. 2011). A high risk of transmission to people has been reported as contact with the patient in the later disease stages. The clinical manifestations for filovirus infection are epistaxis, melena, hematemesis, petechiae, ecchymosis, and bleeding at needle puncture sites. Patients may also develop neurological symptoms such as delirium, coma, and convulsions (Colebunders and Borchert 2000). There is no specific treatment for filovirus hemorrhagic fever. Supportive care is required for the treatment. Blood transfusions from convalescent patients were reported to help in the Kikwit Ebola epidemic. Several antiviral compounds have been shown to inhibit the viral replication in vitro and prevent death in animal models (Leroy et al. 2011) .",

The most common transmission route of brucellosis is contact with infected animals and their products such as milk, butter, cream, cheese, ice cream, urine, blood, carcasses, and abortion products. Brucella organisms can survive for up to 2 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months in milk (at 8 \u00b0C), frozen meat, and goat cheese, respectively. Brucellosis is rarely transmitted between humans. Aerosol transmission and dissemination is considered the most effective route of delivery in a bioterrorism scenario. The treatment of brucellosis is based on the administration of doxycycline or streptomycin (Ariza et al. 2007). Currently, there is no safe and effective human brucellosis vaccine. Only live and attenuated vaccines have been used effectively in livestock (Yumuk and O\u2019Callaghan 2012).",

Additionally, vegetable contamination has been reported to be an important route of Salmonella species infection (Franz and van Bruggen 2008). The disease presents with two clinical manifestations including typhoid and typhoid-like fever and gastroenteritis. The most common infection route of salmonellosis is through the ingestion of contaminated food.

V. cholerae is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterium. Several cholera pandemics have been related to O1 and O139, which are structures of the O antigen in its lipopolysaccharide. The cholera toxin (CT) is the primary toxin produced by V. cholerae O1 and O139. CT is important for the clinical manifestations of cholera. This disease causes the patient to hypersecrete electrolytes and water, sometimes causing death. The most common clinical presentations of this disease are watery diarrhea, which may be associated with vomiting, muscle cramps, and complications related to dehydration and metabolic acidosis. There are two routes of transmission of V. cholerae: aquatic reservoirs in the environment (primary transmission) and already-infected individuals (secondary transmission), which initiate outbreaks and epidemics in the endemic areas, respectively. Rehydration is the first recommendation for cholera treatment, but antibiotics have also been shown to be important therapeutics in both severe cases and epidemic situations. Cholera is most frequently treated with antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline. Furazolidone, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol are effective against severe cholera in young children and pregnant women. For multidrug-resistant cholera, ciprofloxacin is an important substitute drug of choice. The currently available killed injectable vaccine has been shown to be less effective.",

Microarray-based (gene chips) technologies offer great potential for environmental monitoring; this approach includes improved accuracy, lower power and sample consumption, disposability, and automation (Ivnitski et al. 2003). Additionally, hybrid technologies represent a stand-alone system for the rapid, continuous monitoring of multiple biological agents in a given environment (Ivnitski et al. 2003). This system has several key advantages over competing technologies, including (i) the ability to detect up to 100 different agents, (ii) the flexibility and ease with which new bead-based assays can be developed and integrated into the system, (iii) low false-positive and false-negative rates, (iv) the ability to use the same basic system components for multiple deployment architectures, and (v) the relatively low cost per assay and minimal consumables.

Immunological methods include immunochromatographic lateral flow assays, electrochemiluminescence assays, ELISA, time-resolved fluorescence assays, immunofluorescence assays, and immunohistochemistry. The primary disadvantage of polyclonal antibodies of immunoassays is the lack of the specificity required for useful detection and definitive identification, due to the cross-reactive properties of certain antigens of various pathogenic species.",

The first biosensor was the \u201cenzyme electrode,\u201d which was used to describe glucose oxidase in 1962. The biosensor enables a broad spectrum of analyses in complex sample matrices (such as blood, serum, urine, or food) and the real-time monitoring of specific biological agents. Biosensors have shown great promise in areas such as clinical diagnostics, food analysis, bioprocess, and environmental monitoring (Leonard et al. 2003). However, several disadvantages of biosensors have been observed, including high costs, hazards, and disposal problems in radiolabeled probes (Ivnitski et al. 1999); a long incubation time and insufficient sensitivity in flow immunosensors (Ivnitski et al. 1999); a long incubation time in piezoelectric biosensors (Ivnitski et al. 1999); a long assay time and lack of sensitivity in bioluminescence sensors (Ivnitski et al. 1999); high cost and flow cell stability in surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors (Leonard et al. 2003); and antigen-binding sites in phage-antibody technology (Dover et al. 2009).",

The majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin (Taylor et al. 2001). A zoonotic disease outbreak in human populations would likely pose a health risk to animal populations in the target area. Therefore, communication between veterinary and human public health officials is essential. There are several steps related to preparedness for zoonotic diseases: (i) Improved communication is necessary between veterinarian and human health professionals, as is surveillance of animal populations (such as wildlife and companion animals) and thus the control and prevention of zoonotic disease in animals. Domestic and wildlife animals are exposed to infectious agents and environmental contaminants in the air, soil, water, and food; therefore, animals serve as disease sentinels or an early warning system (Rabinowitz et al. 2006). (ii) There should be adequate planning, such as diagnostic tools, for the zoonotic diseases. (iii) Antibiotics should be stockpiled. (iv) Training should be provided to medical personnel and government officials. (v) Personal protective equipment (such as eye protection, gowns, gloves, and masks) would facilitate reducing the likelihood of infection through either direct contact or respiratory droplets. (vi) Vaccinations should be planned.\n",
