Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent e\u00a4orts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of arti\u2026cial intelligence. This model can be adjusted to describe past outbreaks as well as COVID-19. Our novel methodology may have important implications for national health systems, international stakeholders and policy makers.",

Indeed, dealing with infectious diseases from a mathematical angle could reveal inherent patterns and underlying structures that govern outbreaks. Stakeholders utilize available data from current and previous outbreaks in order to forecast infection rates, identify how to restrict the spread of diseases, and eventually introduce vaccination policies that will be most e\u00a4ective. Epidemiology is essentially a biology discipline concerned with public health and as such, it can be heavily in \u2021uenced by mathematical theory. Most phenomena observed at population level are often very complex and di\u00a2 cult to decode just by observing the characteristics of isolated individuals [17] . Statistical analyses of epidemiological data help to characterize, quantify and summarize the way diseases spread in host populations. Interestingly, mathematical models appear as e\u00a2 cient ways to explore and test various epidemiological hypotheses, mostly due to the existence of ethical and practical limitations when deducting experiments on living populations. Models provide conceptual results on e.g., the basic reproduction number, threshold e\u00a4ects or herd immunity. One additional element of epidemiological modeling is the link with data via statistical methods. Although simple epidemiological models are often used, viral and bacterial infections commonly require increased complexity. There are many models in the literature on single epidemics, endemic diseases and spatiotemporal disease dynamics. The aim is to develop robust public health policies in de\u2026ning optimal vaccination strategies.",

The most popular mathematical model in this category is the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model, in which all individuals of a \u2026nite population interact in the same manner. Individuals at time t are susceptible (S), infected (I) or recovered (R). The \u2026nal size of the epidemic will strongly depend upon the initial conditions of the number of susceptible and infected individuals as well as the infection parameter. The \u2026nal size distribution of the simple SIR model in most cases is bimodal presenting two local maxima. This bimodal feature is caused by two likely scenarios; either the epidemic dies out quickly infecting few individuals, or it becomes long-lasting and substantial. However, stochasticity in the form of random walk transmission mechanisms related to spreading processes has never been explored in epidemiology widely [18] [19] [20] . For example, in computer science, some arti\u2026cially created viruses propagate randomly by a plethora of online communication channels. To the best of our knowledge, we are the \u2026rst to scrutinize extensively the role of random walks in epidemic spreading and provide the proper mathematical arsenal to model it robustly. Interestingly, random walk paths converge in distribution to Brownian motions [21] . In this work, we assume that a biological carrier of virus Y is at position X(t) at any given time t.

X t ; t 0 is supposed to follow a Brownian motion on a 2-dimensional sphere S 2 of radius a, i.e the sphere in R of dimension 3. We consider this a proxy for earth, spreading via spherical and stereographic coordinates. Next, using the Laplace-Beltrami operator we construct the Brownian motion infectious process on the 2-dimensional sphere, using spherical and stereographic coordinates as local coordinates. We evaluate explicitly certain quantities related to generated di\u00a4usion processes. In what follows, we compute the transition and transmission density for the X t ; t 0, and we derive the stochastic di\u00a4erential equations that govern the infectious disease dynamics for X t ; t 0 in those local coordinates. We continue with the calculation of expectations of outbreak exit times in time and space of speci\u2026c domains, possessing certain symmetries. Moreover, the moment generating functions are produced. In mathematical terms, we derive the stochastic re \u2021ection principle on S 2 for the infectious disease transmission process. Re \u2021ection points can be extremely useful to calculate the distribution functions of certain temporal quantities related to the dynamics. Additionally, we evaluate boundary local times of \u2026rst hitting of the outbreak for an epidemic or a hybrid endemicepidemic model.

Bernoulli used his model to show that inoculation against the virus would increase the life expectancy at birth by about three years. A revision of the main \u2026ndings and a presentation of the criticism by D'Alembert, appears recently in Dietz and Heesterbeek [23] . Lambert in 1772 as well as Laplace in 1812 extended the Bernoulli model by incorporating age-dependent parameters [24, 25] . However, further systematic research was absent until the beginning of the twentieth century with the pioneering work of Ross in 1911, which is considered the inaugural study of modern mathematical epidemiology [26] . Ross used a set of equations to approximate the discrete-time dynamics of malaria via a mosquito-based pathogen transmission [27] . Importantly, the past century has witnessed the rapid emergence and development of substantial theories in epidemics. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [28] derived the celebrated threshold theorem, which is one of the key results in epidemiology. It predicts -depending on the transmission potential of the infectionthe critical fraction of susceptibles in the population that must be exceeded if an epidemic is to occur. Kermack and McKendrick published three seminal papers, establishing what is called the deterministic compartmental epidemic modelling [29] [30] [31] , wherein they addressed the mass-action incident in disease transmission cycles, assuming that the probability of infection of a susceptible is analogous to the number of its contacts with infected individuals. This deterministic representation was in line with the Law of Mass Action [32] introduced by Guldberg and Waage in 1864 and renders the basic most commonly used SIR model, which assumes homogeneous mixing of the contacts and conservation of the total population and low rates of interaction. MacDonald extended Ross's model to explain in depth the transmission process of malaria. Utilizing modern computer power, the mathematical model for the dynamics and the control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens provided robust results in real-word applications. Overall, the family of models they introduced is known by now as Ross-MacDonald models [33] . Moreover, the classic work of Bartlett [34] examined models and data to explore the factors that determine disease persistence in large populations. Arguably, a landmark book on mathematical modelling of epidemiological systems was published by Bailey [35] and highlighted the importance of public health decision making [36] . Given the diversity of infectious diseases studied since the middle of the 1950s, an impressive variety of epidemiological models have been developed. In addition, we should highlight the 19th century works by Enko [37] [38] [39] , who \u2026rst published a probabilistic model for describing the epidemic of measles, yet in discrete time. This model is the precursor of the popular Reed-Frost chain binomial model introduced by Frost in 1928 in biostatistics'lectures at Johns Hopkins University [40] . It assumes that the infection spreads from an infected to a susceptible individual via a discrete time Markov chain, and set the basis of contemporary stochastic epidemic modelling, on which we will also focus in our present work.",

In this study they concluded that temperature seasonality might be a source of the disease, yet they suggested for the \u2026rst time that controlling markets could help controlling outbreaks. Lee and Pietz [42] developed a mathematical model for Zika virus using logistic growth in human populations. Sun et al., [43] proposed a transmission model for cholera in China and observed that reducing the spread requires extensive immunization coverage of the population. Nishiura et al. [44] developed a Zika mathematical model which exhibited the same dynamics as dengue fever, and Khan et al. [45] introduced a model whereby a saturation function describes well the typhoid fever dynamics. Gui and Zhang [46] , developed a modi\u2026ed SIR model demonstrating nonlinearities in recovery rates. Their model exhibited a backward bifurcation phenomenon, which in turn implied that a plain reduction of the reproduction number less than one, was not rendered su\u00a2 cient to stop the disease spread. Li et al. [47] constructed a multi-group brucellosis model and found out that the best way to contain the disease is to avoid cross infection of animal populations. Moreover, Yu and Lin [48] identi\u2026ed complex dynamical behaviour in epidemiological models and particularly the existence of multiple limit cycle bifurcations using a predictor-prey model. Shi et al. [49] proposed an HIV model with a saturated reverse function to describe the dynamics of infected cells. Additionally, Bonyah et al. [50] developed a SIR model to study the dynamics of buruli ulcer and suggested policy measures to control the disease. Lastly, Zhang et al. [51] developed a model with a latent period of the disease wherein the person is not infectious with saturated incidence rates and treatment functions, called SEIR epidemic model.",

Usually, random variables describe the time of recovery since infection. For discrete random variables (e.g., number of individuals) it is easy to de\u2026ne a probability distribution, whilst for continuous variables the time of recovery since infection is modelled. Often, in this last category it is not possible to \u2026x a probability as there is in\u2026nity of such times. Hence, we \u2026rst de\u2026ne a cumulative distribution and then express a probability density function from this cumulative distribution. Infectious periods are exponentially distributed with a mean infectious duration, however as frequently real data does not back up this assumption, we rather use constant duration. To account for such more realistic distributions, the assumption that the probability of recovery does not depend on the time since infection, is often relaxed. Then, a common method of stages can be used to replace the infective compartment by a series of successive ones, each with an exponential distribution of the same parameter, leading to a total duration of the infectious period modelled by a gamma distribution [17] .",

            "text": "Epidemic models presented above describe rapid outbreaks during which normally the host population is assumed to be in a constant state. For longer periods, deaths and births feed the population with new susceptibles, possibly allowing the disease to persist at a constant prevalence. This state renders an endemic state in the population [17] . In this case, we account for birth and death rate of the host population, whereby a good approximation is that the population size N=S+I+R is constant. When deterministic dynamics prevail a threshold on the value of the basic reproduction number exists. Conditions regarding this number guarantee the disease persistence, but in epidemic models such persistence can be dependent upon the magnitude of the stochastic \u2021uctuations around the steady-state equilibrium. Furthermore, many times diseases are in an endemo-epidemic state. As endemic models exhibit damped oscillations which converge toward an endemic equilibrium, this equilibrium can be weakly stable with perturbations (intrinsic or extrinsic), which excite and sustain the inherent oscillation behaviour [57] . This behaviour is due to heterogeneity that is added temporally to the coe\u00a2 cient of transmission, spatially in the context of meta-populations, or by cohorts for age-structured models. Lastly, heterogeneity can be added statistically in case of stochastic versions. For example, a stochastic version of the endemic SIR model can utilize a Markov process, in which the future is independent of the past given the present, with a state space de\u2026ned by the number of individuals in each of the three classes, and changes in the state space characterized by probabilistic transition events. And as future events are independent on past events, the time to the next event follows a negative exponential distribution.",

            "text": "Over the years, a vast number of mathematical modeling approaches has been proposed, tackling the problem from di\u00a4erent perspectives. The prevailing taxonomy proposed by Siettos and Russo (2013) [58] encompasses three general categories: (1) statistical methods of outbreaks and their identi\u2026cation of spatial patterns in real epidemics, (2) state-space models of the evolution of a \"hypothetical\"or on-going epidemic spread, and (3) machine learning methods, all utilized also for predictability purposes vis-\u00e0-vis an ongoing epidemic. In particular, the \u2026rst category includes i) regression methods [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] , ii) times series analysis, namely ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA approaches [65] [66] [67] [68] , iii) process control methods including cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) methods [75, 76] , as well as iv) Hidden Markov models (HMM) [77, 78] . The second category incorporates i) \"continuum\"models in the form of di\u00a4erential and/or (integro)-partial di\u00a4erential equations [79] [80] [81] [82] , ii) discrete and continuous-time Markov-chain models [83] [84] [85] , iii) complex network models which relax the hypotheses of the previous stochastic models that interactions among individuals are instantaneous and homogeneous [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] , and iv) Agent-based models [92] [93] [94] [95] . Lastly, the third category includes well-known machine learning approaches widely used in computer science, such as i) arti\u2026cial neural networks [96] , ii) web-based data mining [97, 98] and iii) surveillance networks [99] , to name a few.",

Ethical and practical reasons defer from conducting enormous experiments in public health systems, hence mathematical models appear to be an e\u00a2 cient way to explore contagion dynamics. A key aspect of epidemiological models is their link to real data, which is of particular utility toward the design of vaccination policies. Two major vaccination strategies exist currently, i.e., the mass vaccination, which is most applied, and the recently developed pulse vaccination which is used in an increasing number of countries. However, most vaccination strategies are imperfect in the sense that they decrease the number of cases, without however eradicating the disease.",

As we pointed out, many shortcomings exist for those models. All the models already used in the literature assume that the host population has constant size. However, this excludes diseases in exponentially growing populations as in most developing countries, or disease-induced mortality as childhood diseases in developing countries e.g., malaria. Modeling infectious dynamics in non-stationary host populations requires explicit modeling of the host population as well as of the disease per se. Models sometimes can be highly complicated in order to improve best \u2026t to real data. Nonetheless, very complex models do not always perform optimally in real-world applications or in simulations. Real-world models allow for swift decision making, and suitable quanti\u2026cation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of an outbreak. Multidisciplinary research e\u00a4orts are speeding up, integrating the advances in epidemiology, molecular biology, computational science and applied mathematics. Mathematical modeling allows better understanding of the transmission process of infectious diseases in space and time, by setting forth rigorously the proper assumptions, the variables, the equations and their parameters.",

Simulations or brute-force computational techniques have been implemented in that direction to provide approximate solutions with encouraging results.

Simulations often prove to be ine\u00a2 cient for the systematic analysis of an emergent epidemic.

It can be of particular interest, in light of a recent intensive worldwide e\u00a4ort to speed up the establishment of a global surveillance network for combating pandemics of emergent and re-emergent infectious diseases. Toward this aim, mathematical modeling will play a major role in assessing, controlling and forecasting potential outbreaks.

Furthermore, we plan to convey an extensive comparative evaluation investigation of SBDiEM vis-\u00e0-vis the three major categories set forth by the taxonomy of Siettos and Russo (2013) , and more speci\u2026cally versus (1) statistical methods for epidemic surveillance, (2) state-space models of epidemic spread and (3) machine learning methods. In this way, the forecasting and nowcasting capabilities of the new model will be thoroughly explored. We also intend to investigate embedding the proposed analytical model into integrated arti\u2026cial intelligence systems in the near future. Our novel methodology apart from o\u00a4ering a much better understanding of the complex and heterogeneous infectious disease dynamics could enhance predictability of epidemic outbreaks as well as have potentially important implications for national health systems, stakeholders and international policy makers.",
