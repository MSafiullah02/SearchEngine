For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014. In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14 days. In conclusions, meteorological factors play an independent role in the COVID-19 transmission after controlling population migration.

We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0\u00b0C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/",

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus. Due to the high contiguousness and wide spread, COVID-19 has officially been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). As of March 21th, more than 170 countries has reported this epidemic, with a total diagnosed cases of about 234,073 causing over 9000 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020b) . Europe and the United States have gradually becoming the epicenter of the pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020c) and the world is facing great public health crisis from COVID-19, which is likely more severe than SARS in 2003.",

To block the quick spread of infection and control the severe epidemic, China has conducted strict measures by mobilizing and redistributing nationwide resources, shelter-in-place and quarantining all confirmed cases and close contacts. A study indicated that a series of control measures since January 23, 2020 in China reduced the COVID-19 epidemic size significantly, and the similar measures were expected to remain until the end of April 2020 (Yang et al., 2020) . The current daily new COVID-19 cases in China have reached very low level. China has cumulatively reported more than 81,008 confirmed cases and over 3,255 deaths as of March 21, 2020 (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). Among all these effective strategies in controlling this epidemic, locking down Wuhan, a city of 11 million residents, was one of the most dramatic measures. It turned out that the limitation of population migration was effective in controlling epidemic diseases like COVID-19. However, the independent effect of meteorological factors on the transmission of COVID-19 has not been studied systemically while controlling population migration.",

The SARS epidemic was gradually faded with the warming weather coming, and was basically ended in July, 2003 (Tan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2016) , suggesting that the temperature and its variations might have affected the SARS outbreak. Some studies have suggested that the climate change might have contributed to various infectious diseases emergence and spread (Lofgren et al., 2007; Gale et al., 2010; Stott, 2016) , including the SARS and COVID-19. In Korea, researchers found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low/high relative humidity (RH), but a positively correlated with diurnal temperature range (DTR) (Park et al., 2020) . Absolute humidity (AH) had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates (Shaman et al., 2010; Shaman et al., 2011) . One important feature of COVID-19 epidemic is that the countries currently suffering most from the disease are most located in the regions with low temperature. Therefore, meteorological factors, such as ambient temperature (AT) and humidity, might play an important role in the spread of the disease.",

Luo etc. reported that weather was related to the spread of COVID-19, but the increase of temperature may not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions (Luo et al., 2020) . In another study, researchers estimated that the weather variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time, and the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects (Oliveiros et al., 2020) . Because of the human to human transmission, the migration should be considered when evaluate the effects of meteorological factors over COVID-19 transmission.

Some studies suggested that global climate change might be accompanied by the changes to the outbreak of infectious diseases (Bezirtzoglou et al., 2011; Anwar et al., 2019; Casadevall, 2020) . As we know, viruses are completely dependent on their hosts for replication and survival. It is possible that as virus has adapted to gradually higher global AT, some new and previously unknown infectious diseases are likely to emerge and spread (Casadevall, 2020) , such as SARS-CoV and Ebola virus, and poses a threat to human health. The emergence and spread of novel coronavirus since December 2019 might be related to the ongoing climate change. In winter and spring, a decrease in resistance to respiratory diseases in a colder environment for population might be easier to accelerate the spread velocity. Lin etc. showed that in days with a lower air temperature during the epidemic, the risk of increased daily incidence of SARS was 18.18-fold (95% CI: 5.6, 58.8) higher than in days with a higher temperature (Lin et al., 2006) . Tan etc. found a close association between temperature, its variations and the SARS outbreak in the four cities in China, suggesting that SARS more likely outbreaks in spring (Tan et al., 2005) . Consistent with these results, we also found that each 1\u00b0C increase in AT was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, the corresponding overall RR was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85). In addition, Lambrechts etc. has found that a large DTR might impede dengue virus infection of the mosquito midgut and reduce transmission risks compared to a small DTR or constant temperature. Intensity of dengue virus transmission can be influenced by the specific combination of mean and range in temperature fluctuations (Lambrechts et al., 2011) . In our study, each 1\u00b0C increase in DTR was associated with decreased (D) Pooled estimates in lag 0, lag 03, lag 07 and lag 014. The associations of COVID-19 case counts with AT, AH and DTR in each city was evaluated by fitting generalized linear models respectively (Lag 03). The meta-analysis was conducted to combine the city-specific results. AT: Ambient Temperature; DTR: Diurnal Temperature Range; AH, Absolute Humidity. patients in lag 03 and the pooled RR was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95). This suggests that novel coronavirus might be also more suited to survive in an environment with small DTR or constant temperature.",

            "text": "AH is an indicator describing the mass of water vapor per volume of air (g/m 3 ). Shaman et al. found that 50% of influenza virus transmission variability and 90% of influenza virus survival variability could be explained by AH variation, whereas, only 12% and 36% could be explained by relative humidity (Shaman and Kohn, 2009) , and the epidemic influenza typically peaks in the winter when low AH maximizes R0 (Shaman et al., 2011) . A previous study found that AH was one of most important weather parameters in predicting heat-related mortality among a spectrum of weather parameters (Zhang et al., 2014) . These studies indicated that AH may be a better indicator of humidity in acute health effects. The COVID-19 outbreak in China happened in winter and early spring with lower AH. Our results indicated that there might exist an optimum low humidity for COVID-19 to spread. Because those 12 cities with AH below 4 g/m 3 confirmed fewer case counts than other cities. For the 17 cities with more than 50 cases, results showed that every 1 g/m 3 increase in AH was significantly associated with declined confirmed case counts in lag 07, lag 014 and the combined RR was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.89) and 0.33 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.54). Consistent with our results, Liu et al. has explored the effects of AH on H7N9 infection risks in China and found significantly higher effects of low AH on risks of H7N9 infection (Liu et al., 2018) . Possible explanation is that low AH might increase the stability of coronavirus and favor its transmission like influenza did (Lowen et al., 2007) . Our results are somewhat different from a previous study about early COVID-19 outbreak, which reported that the changes in temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arriving might not lead to decline of confirmed case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions (Luo et al., 2020) . Although public health control measures play a major role in controlling pandemic like COVID-19, our results indicate an independent role of weather conditions on the transmission. Unlike this study, we used data over a longer period and controlled the population migration in our models. Therefore, we are optimistic that this epidemic will be faded to a large degree in the coming warmer season with the enforcement of public health interventions in China.",
