For demonstration of circulating FCoV immune complexes, a competitive ELISA was performed (Pfeiffer, 1991). Test serum was treated with polyethylenglycole for precipitation of immune complexes. The resolubilized precipitate was applied to a microtitre plate coated with FIPV (FIPV-DF2). FCoV-containing immune complexes inhibit binding of a mouse monoclonal antibody against FCoV to the FIPV-coated microtiter plate. Thereby, binding of peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG is reduced, resulting in lower extinction levels. The threshold value for a positive result had been statistically evaluated (Schroo, 1994).",

On the other hand, our findings indicate that prevention of FIP obviously requires an even more intense B-cell immune response, accompanied by an increased and effective T-cell response. This does not rule out that lymphocyte depletion also may depend on virus variants which can evolve independently in each infected individual (Herrewegh et al., 1997, Vennema et al., 1998).",
