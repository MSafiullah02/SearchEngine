Priority should be given to life-threatening but treatable conditions such as hepatic abscess, cholangitis, and falciparum malaria, and to diseases that threaten the public health, such as hepatitis A and several of the viral hemorrhagic fevers. It is important to rule out diseases that are also common in temperate climates, such as cholecystitis and pancreatic carcinoma, and noninfectious processes that occur more frequently in the tropics, such as veno-occlusive disease.",

Hepatic necrosis has been reported also with dengue hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever. Hepatic impairment and elevated levels of transaminases in the serum that occur in up to 60% of persons with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are due to infection of the liver with the SARS-associated coronavirus.41\n",

The diagnosis is suggested by peripheral blood eosinophilia and confirmed by demonstration of worms and eggs in the liver by biopsy or at autopsy.

Worms that die in the biliary tree may form the nidus of gallstones.68 In a series of 500 patients with biliary and pancreatic ascariasis in India, 56% had biliary colic, 24% had acute cholangitis, 13% had acute cholecystitis, 6% had pancreatitis, and 1% had liver abscesses.14 The diagnosis is made by US, CT, cholangiography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and may demonstrate worms in the biliary or pancreatic ducts or gallbladder.69,\n70 Treatment consists of extraction of worms during ERCP or anthelmintic treatment, preferably with pyrantel pamoate, which acts rapidly and paralyzes the worms.

Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is a condition of unknown cause in the Far East in which there is formation of pigment stones and sludge. It has been suggested that parasites such as Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, and Ascaris act as the nidus for stone formation in this condition, but dietary deficiencies that alter bile salt metabolism may be more important.",

For example, HIV infection may lead to unusual clinical syndromes, such as cholangitis caused by cytomegalovirus, intestinal coccidia, microsporidia, and mycobacteria, or bacterial peliosis due to Bartonella. HIV co-infection has been associated with decreased egg excretion in persons with S. mansoni due to impaired granuloma formation and increased trapping of eggs in tissue. Serologic tests for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis may yield false negative results in HIV-infected patients, but recovery of parasites from the peripheral blood is enhanced. Treatment of certain infections of the hepatobiliary tract in persons infected with HIV may present difficult challenges, such as the high rate of relapse of visceral leishmaniasis following standard therapy. Importantly, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may play a key role in preventing progression of latent diseases, reducing the rate of relapse, and enhancing efficacy of treatment.82,\n83\n",
