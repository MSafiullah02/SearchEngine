This worked well as the individual leaders had an in-depth understanding of their systems plus interpersonal relations with referring physicians for optimal execution. Like many other health systems, we are witnessing the tremendous impact of this pandemic. The imaging volumes have drastically reduced, and this parallels the impact seen across other radiology departments in the country and the world(11, 12) Interestingly, in addition to the decreases in nonurgent imaging, we also saw a decrease in ED imaging volumes, suggesting that patients are less willing to come to hospitals during the COVID outbreak. This trend was also seen in multiple other emergency departments around the country(13). The health impact of delaying imaging for a large proportion of patients is unknown and difficult to estimate.

This will involve a phased process to ensure adequate social distancing. We will be implementing the valuable lessons that we learned during the rescheduling process, including clear communications. For example, we are posting social media messages about our steps to maintain patient safety. Our residents are also contacting and reassuring patients regarding the safety of our imaging facilities. We understand that how we operationalize our recovery, including patient experience during reentry, is critical for our stabilization.",

For example, our technologists and radiologists belong to different health systems with different email domains which limited file sharing capabilities and added extra steps to our communications. A common limitation reported by radiologists was the difficulty in obtaining accurate clinical indications from the EMR efficiently, resulting in a time intensive process. The indication for the study was not readily seen on some of the schedule filters. The order entry in our system utilizes clinical decision support for all cross-sectional imaging; however, no hard stops exist if meaningless, misleading, or inaccurate information is entered. For example, a clinician can enter \"*\" or \"other\" as the study indication, which in turn required a deeper chart review. For some patients, the severity of symptoms and activity of disease were not clear even after extensive review of the EMR. These patients were contacted to ask about new or progressive symptoms since the last scan, to provide a more accurate assessment of the urgency for scanning.",
