The seemingly very low toxicity of bisphosphonate and pyrophosphomonoester drugs in vivo, may allow novel approaches to the immunotherapy of viral infections. For example, these drugs can be used to stimulate V\u24259V\u24262 T cells to release antiviral molecules that directly suppress virus replication without destroying the virus-replicating cells. In addition, the soluble molecules released by \u2425\u2426 T cells could boost the antiviral potency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and promote antigen presentation. The relative therapeutic value of drug-induced direct antiviral and immunoregulatory activities may depend on the infecting virus as well as on the nature of protective immune responses.",

The early synthesis of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines) influences substantially the subsequent immune response and may, therefore, affect the course of infection. One of the important effectors of natural immunity are \u2425\u2426 T lymphocytes, which display a broad antiviral activity against different viruses such as retroviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, picornaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses, and orthopoxviruses (reviewed in [1] ). This broad antiviral activity of \u2425\u2426 T cells is likely to play a crucial defensive role, especially considering that their relatively large numbers (e.g., approximately one out of every 30 adult human peripheral blood lymphocytes is a V\u24259V\u24262 T lymphocyte) can respond very quickly (typically, no antigen processing 0165 is required for the potent major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted activities of V\u24259V\u24262 T cells) and release soluble antiviral factors.",

Probably the most important representatives of this group are intermediates of isoprenoid biosynthesis [2] (e.g., 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate and isopentenylpyrophosphate) and were first isolated from mycobacteria [3] [4] [5] . Other natural and synthetic phospho-ligands [6, 7] , alkylamines [8] and aminobiphosphonates [9] also stimulate V\u24259V\u24262 T cells. Structure-function studies of V\u24259V\u24262specific ligands suggest that some of these molecules could be readily docked into a putative binding site of the V\u24259V\u24262 TCR [10, 11] . Functionally, mature V\u24259V\u24262 T cells express cell-surface inhibitory receptors for MHC class I molecules (INMRs) that may control TCR-mediated reactivities in the antiviral response [12, 13] .",

This leads to an accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential metabolite that is directly recognized by V\u24259V\u24262 T cells [14] .

In hepatoma cells exposed to lovastatin (an inhibitor of 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate), hepatitic C virus (HCV) RNA replication is impaired due to the dissolution of the HCV replication complex [15] .

The innate noncytolytic activity encompasses the production and release of several soluble molecules. As shown in Fig. 2 , peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP, a classical non-peptidic antigen for V\u24259V\u24262 T cells) release an array of cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, IL-1\u2423, IL-6, GM-CSF, TPO, OSM) and chemokines (e.g., MIP-1\u2423/\u2424, RANTES, SDF-1, MCP-2 MDC, ENA-78 and GRO) with known antiviral and/or immunomodulatory properties. After stimulation and in sharp contrast to many non-\u2425\u2426 TCR-expressing lymphoid cells, single V\u24259V\u24262 T lymphocytes produce more than one of these soluble antiviral/immunoregulatory factors (Fig. 3) . The innate response is followed by humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses influenced by many of these soluble molecules. In addition, the non-cytolytic antiviral molecules continue to suppress the infectious process in vital organs without destroying important cells and also can boost the antiviral potency of classical \u2423\u2424 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [21] .",

In vitro, the noncytolytic antiviral activity of interferons has been demonstrated in infections with HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpesviruses, orthopoxviruses, picornaviruses, retroviruses, influenza and other type of viruses (reviewed in [21, 24] ). In hepatitis B-transgenic mice, IFN-\u2425 released by CD8 T cells is able to diminish the HBV gene expression and replication and activates hepatocytes to clear the virus through a non-cytolytic pathway [25] . In the acute phase of HCV infection, the ability of T cells to produce IFN-\u2425 is associated with virus clearance [26] . Recently, it has been shown that NS3 peptide-stimulated CD8 T cells release IFN-\u2425 and reduce HCV RNA replication activity [27] . Generally, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), the appearance of CD8positive CTLs is better correlated with protection against HCV than the antibody response [28] . This is compatible with the idea that the production of IFN-\u2425 by CD8-positive T-lymphocytes may contribute to the resolution of the infection [28] . Despite the potent interferon effects, the majority of Fig. 3 . In contrast to \u2423\u2424 T lymphocytes or CD3-negative cells, a substantial proportion of activated V\u24262 T lymphocytes produce multiple cytokines. Human PBMCs were incubated (24 h) in culture medium with of 128 M sodium pamidronate and the IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 intracellular presence was assessed by flow cytometry. During the last 4 h of incubation, brefeldin A (10 g/ml) was present to block the cytokine release from cells. Polyclonal stimulation with concanavalin A (not shown) generated a very similar pattern-that is large numbers of V\u24262+ CD3+ double producers (in contrast to predominant single producers in the \u2423\u2424 + CD3+ and V\u24262-CD3-pools) with the exception of substantially larger amounts of single-TNF-\u2423-positive \u2423\u2424 T cells. The cytokine production by the \u2423\u2424+ CD3+ or V\u24262-CD3-cells in pamidronate-stimulated cultures was inhibited by anti-IFN-\u2425 mAbs suggesting that IFN-\u2425 released by pamidronate-stimulated V\u24259V\u24262 T cells may be an important factor in the induction of cytokine synthesis by the tested non-V\u24259V\u24262 T cell pools.",

The activation of V\u24259V\u24262 T cells with IPP induces (within 4-12 h) the production of MIP-1\u2423, MIP-1\u2424, and lymphotactin, but not macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [46] . The induction of MIP-1\u2423 and MIP-1\u2424 is unaffected by IL-4, IL-10, or INF-\u2425, but IPP plus IL-12-induced release of MIP-1\u2423, but not MIP-1\u2424, is blocked by TGF-\u2424. V\u24259V\u24262 T cells also express many \u2424-chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR5, and CCR8 that can be downregulated by activation stimuli. Activating signals for \u2425\u2426 T cells also induce the production of macrophage chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2) and MDC. MCP-2 plays an important role in the inflammatory response of blood monocytes and tissue macrophages and inhibits the replication of HIV-1 via CCR5 [47] . MDC is chemotactic for monocytes, dendritic cells, activated lymphocytes, and NK cells and exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity [48] . Cumulatively, the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with antiviral properties produced by activated V\u24259V\u24262 T cells may influence the progression of HIV disease.",

Through these molecules, \u2425\u2426 T cells may influence the behavior of granulocytes-that is the cells that are likely to release of \u2423-defensins and other non-cytolytic antiviral factors. \u2423-defensins are a family of antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in animals (including human and non-human primates) and plants. They play an important role in infections, inflammation, wound repair, and acquired immunity. Based on the disulfide pairing of their characteristic six cysteine residues, they are divided into \u2423defensins and \u2424-defensins. \u2423-defensins are mainly released by granulocytes and can inhibit HIV infection in vitro [49] . In addition to their anti-HIV activities, \u2423-defensins interfere with the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2, CMV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and influenza virus [50] . The expression of \u2423-defensins in \u2425\u2426 T cells has been described [51] , but further studies are required to explore the contribution of \u2425\u2426 T cells to the production and action of defensins during viral infections.",

Beneficial effects of TNF-\u2423 in cellular immunity to VSV [52] , CMV [53] , HSV-1 [54] , and vaccinia virus [55] have been noted. TNF-\u2423 was shown to enhance HIV-1 replication in chronically infected promonocytic and T-lymphoid cell lines by activation of the nuclear factor NF-B, which stimulates the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus [31] . In contrast, IFN-\u2425 (an important enhancer of TNF-\u2423 production by macrophages) inhibits the HIV-1 growth in primary macrophages [56] . While TNF-\u2423 has a protective role in activated CD4+ T cells against R5-tropic viruses, it enhances CXCR4 expression of CD4+ T cells and mediates an increased susceptibility to infection with X4tropic HIV and SIV strains. Therefore, the role of TNF-\u2423 in HIV infections is somewhat intricate, and further studies are needed to clarify its effects.",

Therefore, the MVA pathway may be important for viral assembly of particles requiring: (a) the prenylation of viral (HDV) or cellular (HCV, RSV) proteins; or (b) the synthesis of cholesterol (HIV, HBV) that is necessary for membrane budding. Blocking this pathway by statins or N-BPs interferes with both prenylation and cholesterol synthesis. However, the 'pre-IPP' statin inhibition decreases, whereas the 'post-IPP' N-BP block increases the accumulation of IPP, a potent endogenous stimulator of V\u24259V\u24262 T lymphocytes.",
