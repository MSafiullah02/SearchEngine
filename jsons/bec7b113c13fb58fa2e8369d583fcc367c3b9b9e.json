            "text": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) plays an important role in mRNA translation by binding the 5\u00a2-cap structure of the mRNA and facilitating the recruitment to the mRNA of other translation factors and the 40S ribosomal subunit. eIF4E can interact either with the scaffold protein eIF4G or with repressor proteins termed eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). High levels of expression can disrupt cellular growth control and are associated with human cancers. A fraction of the cellular eIF4E is found in the nucleus where it may play a role in the transport of certain mRNAs to the cytoplasm. eIF4E undergoes regulated phosphorylation (at Ser209) by members of the Mnk group of kinases, which are activated by multiple MAP kinases (hence Mnk \u00bc MAPkinase signal integrating kinase). The functional significance of its phosphorylation has been the subject of considerable interest. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila point to a key role for phosphorylation of eIF4E in growth and viability. Initial structural data suggested that phosphorylation of Ser209 might allow formation of a salt bridge with a basic residue (Lys159) that would clamp eIF4E onto the mRNA and increase its affinity for ligand. However, more recent structural data place Ser209 too far away from Lys159 to form such an interaction, and biophysical studies indicate that phosphorylation actually decreases the affinity of eIF4E for cap or capped RNA. The implications of these studies are discussed in the light of other, in vitro and in vivo, investigations designed to address the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in mRNA translation or its control.",

These include, in animal cells, responses to hormones, growth factors, vasoactive agents and cytokines, as well as nutrients such as amino acids and sugars. These conditions generally activate translation. Conversely, under a range of stressful conditions such as oxidative or osmotic stress, DNA damage or nutrient withdrawal, the rate of protein synthesis is decreased. These effects happen within minutes and are considered to be due to changes in the activity, or other functions, of components of the translational machinery. Regulation appears to be achieved primarily by changes in their states of phosphorylation. Within the overall process of mRNA translation, control seems to be exerted mainly at the stage of translation initiation, during which the 40S subunit is recruited to the 5\u00a2-end of the mRNA, the start codon is located and the 60S subunit then joins, to create a complete ribosome capable of entering the elongation stage of the process.",

            "text": "eIF4E is frequently described as the least abundant translation factor although the evidence for this is not strong, being limited to examination of a very limited range of cell types at a time when tools were only available to study a small number of initiation factors. However, rather than abundance per se, it is likely that the availability of eIF4E is critically important for the activity of the initiation process. To function in cap-dependent translation initiation, eIF4E must form initiation complexes involving the scaffold protein eIF4G and its other binding partners, which include the RNA helicases eIF4A I and eIF4A II (indicated with \u00d44A\u00d5 in Fig. 1 ). One molecule of either eIF4A I or eIF4A II can bind to eIF4G [2] , but a functional difference between the two forms has not been established. The complex of eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G is known as the eIF4F complex. eIF4E interacts with eIF4G via a site through which it also binds inhibitory proteins termed 4E-BPs. Association of eIF4E with a 4E-BP prevents it from forming productive initiation complexes with eIF4G; the 4E-BPs thus act as inhibitors of cap-dependent translation [3, 4] . The shuttling protein 4E-T also binds to eIF4E through a similar region [1, 5] . 4E-BP1 is the best understood of the three 4E-BPs known in mammals. It undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, increased phosphorylation resulting in its release from eIF4E. Amino acids, insulin and growth factors are among the numerous stimuli known to increase the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and thus promote eIF4F complex formation [4, 6, 7] . Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is blocked by rapamycin, which inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling pathway (see accompanying review by Proud [1] ). Rapamycin thus blocks the release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E and prevents formation of complexes containing eIF4E and eIF4G.",

            "text": "eIF4E appears to play a critical role in cell regulation. Artificial overexpression of eIF4E causes loss of cellular growth control and this can be reversed by expression of either 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2 [8] [9] [10] [11] . Overexpression of eIF4G can also cause cell transformation, presumably by competing with-endogenous 4E-BPs for eIF4E increasing its availability for eIF4F complex formation [12] . These effects may be associated with the role for eIF4E in enhancing the export of the mRNA for cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The shuttling protein 4E-T [5] is thought to transfer eIF4E to the nucleus, where it appears to be important in transporting the cyclin D1 mRNA to the cytoplasm [13] . The increase in cyclin D1 expression is likely to promote G1 to S progression, and, consistent with this, injection of eIF4E promotes progression into S-phase [10] . Interestingly, a number of human tumours -especially those of neck, oesophagus and breast -show high levels of expression of eIF4E [14] . High levels appear to correlate with aggressive, metastatic, tumours and eIF4E levels may be of value in cancer diagnosis [15] or even in therapy [16] . Since 4E-T also binds to eIF4E via the site occluded by 4E-BPs, rapamycin is expected to interfere with nuclear transport of eIF4E. This may in part explain how rapamycin blocks cell cycle progression: cyclin D1 is required for G1 to S progression, the stage at which rapamycin blocks T-cell activation. Export of cyclin D1 mRNA from the nucleus by eIF4E is modulated by binding of the promyelocytic leukaemia protein PML to eIF4E [17] . PML seems to bind to the dorsal site to eIF4E, as the interaction is abrogated upon mutation of Trp73 in eIF4E to alanine, as shown before for the eIF4GAEeIF4E and the eIF4EAE4E-BP1 interactions. However, PML seems to lack the eIF4Ebinding consensus sequence that is found in eIF4G and the 4E-BPs, e.g. YxxxxL/. The PMLAEeIF4E interaction appears to decrease the affinity of eIF4E for capped mRNA, an effect that may be important in the antitumourigenic effects of PML. For a recent detailed review on the possible roles of eIF4E in the nucleus see ref [18] . eIF4E is among a variety of translation initiation factors that are modified upon induction of apoptosis [19] and eIF4E appears to be important in modulating programmed cell death [20, 21] . eIF4E is dephosphorylated during apoptosis [22] and eIF4E is inactivated (by increased binding to 4E-BP1) in response to DNA damage that leads to apoptosis, but at times well before commitment to cell death [23] . During apoptosis, 4E-BP1 is cleaved near its N-terminus to yield a fragment that binds to eIF4E but is not subject to normal regulation, thus acting as a dominant inhibitor of eIF4F formation and cap-dependent translation [24] .",

            "text": "In higher animals -mammals and insects (at least in Drosophila) -eIF4E is a phosphoprotein. It is phosphorylated by the MAP-kinase signal-integrating kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2, at a single site in vivo, Ser209 in mammals, which lies near the C-terminus of the primary sequence [25, 26] . There has been some confusion about the existence of other phosphorylation sites -Ser53 was initially identified as the site of phosphorylation, but this residue is now known not to be phosphorylated. Considerable excitement was generated when a Ser53fiAla mutant was found not to cause the cell transformation observed upon over-expression of the wildtype protein [9] , apparently suggesting that phosphorylation was essential for its transforming function. Given what we now know, it is more likely that mutation of Ser53 to Ala interferes with the overall structure of eIF4E and thereby affects its function. This finding indicates the degree of caution that must be exercised when interpreting data obtained from presumptive phosphorylation site mutants without strong protein chemical data to support the identification of the site. In particular, it is crucial to show Fig. 1 . Recruitment of initiation complexes to the 5\u00a2-cap structure. eIF4E binds to the 5\u00a2-5\u00a2 m 7 GpppG cap-structure (represented by a black dot) at the 5\u00a2-end of the messenger RNA. Binding of the scaffold protein eIF4G to the dorsal site of eIF4E allows recruitment of several other factors to the mRNA, e.g. eIF4A, the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which binds to the N-terminus of eIF4G, and the Mnks, which bind to the C-terminus of eIF4G. A central domain in eIF4G binds eIF3, which will bring in the 40S small ribosomal subunit and consequently eIF2 with the initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA Met i ). The helicase activity of eIF4A, which is enhanced by eIF4B, is thought to be required for unwinding of secondary structures in the 5\u00a2-UTR region, allowing subsequent movement of the whole complex along the 5\u00a2-UTR, until the initiation codon (AUG) of the open reading frame is recognized by the anticodon of the Met-tRNA (not shown). The interaction of the RNA with PABP through its poly(A)-tail and the binding of PABP to eIF4G circularizes the RNA, a process that is thought to be important for re-initiation of translation or may be required for verification that the mRNA is full-length, i.e. has a cap and a poly(A)-tail. The open reading frame of the mRNA is shown as a thick line. Initiation factors are abbreviated. The arrow indicates the phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209 by the Mnks.The trident structure represents the initiator tRNA Met i . that in vivo phosphorylation of the protein is abolished by the mutation by radiolabelling cells expressing the relevant mutant protein. In the case of multiply phosphorylated proteins, the task is more complex, and analysis must be accompanied by appropriate phosphopeptide mapping [27] .",

            "text": "The structures of both yeast and mammalian eIF4E have been determined -the former by NMR methods, the latter crystallographically. They show a similar overall fold, which has been likened to a baseball glove, in which the methylated base is sandwiched between two highly conserved tryptophan residues [28, 29] . The binding site for the 4E-BPs and eIF4G is a hydrophobic region located on the concave dorsal surface of the protein. Binding of 4E-BP1 or eIF4G to this region induces conformational changes that greatly increase the affinity of eIF4E for capped nucleotide. It is therefore puzzling that the binding of PML to eIF4E, which also involves the dorsal surface of eIF4E, actually decreases the affinity of eIF4E for capped mRNA [17] . Ser209 is located close to the putative channel through which the capped RNA enters the cap-binding site of the eIF4E molecule [28] . This channel is putative as the crystal structure involved only 7-methylGDP and not a capped oligonucleotide.",

            "text": "Phosphorylation of eIF4E is increased in response to a variety of conditions [30] . These include serum treatment of cells, growth factors, phorbol esters, and in some cell types, insulin [31] . Where tested, these effects appear to be mediated via the MEK/Erk pathway, as they are blocked by inhibitors of MEK [31] [32] [33] [34] . Certain cytokines and stressful conditions also increase the phosphorylation of eIF4E [32, 34, 35] , and, where studied, the effects appear to be due to the p38 MAP kinase pathway [32, 35] . Strictly, since the available inhibitors act on the a and b isoforms of p38 MAP kinase [36, 37] , it should be made clear that it is these forms that are responsible for the increases in eIF4E phosphorylation rather than the more-distantly related c or d enzymes. It is the a and b isoforms that can phosphorylate and activate the Mnks [34, 38, 39] . Although certain other stresses (e.g. heat shock, oxidative or osmotic stress) also activate the p38 MAP kinase pathway, they do not cause increased phosphorylation of eIF4E [32] . This probably reflects the fact that they cause loss of eIF4F complexes (due to dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which then sequesters eIF4E [32, 40] , separating it from the Mnks bound to eIF4G). Similarly, the dephosphorylation of eIF4E induced by infection of cells with adenovirus [41] appears to be due to the displacement of Mnk1 from eIF4F complexes by an adenovirus-encoded 100 kDa protein that competes with Mnk1 for binding to eIF4G [42] . In contrast, infection of cells with murine coronavirus activates Mnk1 and increases eIF4E phosphorylation in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner [43] .",

Each group identified two related kinases, now termed Mnk1 and Mnk2. They share substantial similarity (88%) in their catalytic domains, and their N-and C-termini also share quite high levels of similarity (respectively 77% and 65%) (Fig. 2) . It is now clear that there is a second form of human Mnk2, generated by alternative use of coding exons during splicing, resulting in proteins with quite different C-termini (Fig. 2) . The final 80 amino acids of human Mnk2 (which are very similar to the C-terminus of Mnk1) are replaced by an entirely different C-terminal tail of 29 amino acids in the Mnk2b protein [44] . All three Mnk species can interact with eIF4F complexes in vivo [33, 45, 46] . The first, and so far only, report concerning Mnk2b showed that it interacts with the oestrogen receptor in two-hybrid studies. This interaction is specific for Mnk2b (it is not observed for Mnk1 or Mnk2a) and for the b-isoform of the oestrogen receptor [44] . The possible functional significance of this interaction remains unclear. Interestingly, the other isoform of the oestrogen receptor (a) is phosphorylated by another kinase that lies downstream of the Erk signalling, p90 RSK [47] . It is so far unclear whether Mnk2b phosphorylates the b form of the oestrogen receptor.",

In vivo, Mnk1 displays a low level of activity, which is greatly enhanced by treatment of cells with agents that activate either the Erk or the p38 MAP kinase a/b pathway [32, 38, 39] . As indicated above, the effects of such treatments are blocked by inhibitors of these pathways. In contrast, Mnk2a has high basal activity, which is not enhanced further by agents that activate Erk/p38 MAP kinase [46] . Since the high basal activity is reduced by inhibitors of these pathways, it seems to be due to the low basal levels of activity of the pathways that exist in unstimulated cells. This suggests that Mnk2a may be unusually readily phosphorylated and activated by Erk/p38 MAP kinase, and experiments performed in vitro bear this out [46] . Preliminary data suggest that Mnk2b also has relatively high basal activity. are similar (except that they are ext-ended in human Mnk2s: no specific function has yet been reported for this extension.). The N-termini contain a polybasic region which may be involved both in binding to eIF4G [33] and may also function as a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The catalytic domains of Mnk1 and the Mnk2s are also strongly similar. Phosphorylation of two threonine residues (*) within the catalytic domain has been shown to be essential for activation, although additional phosphorylation sites also exist (not shown [46] ). The sequences of the C-termini of Mnk1 and Mnk2a are similar and contain sequences for MAPK binding. Small differences within these sequences play a role in determining the specificity for ERK and p38MAPK. The last 29 amino acids of Mnk2b are quite different from the C-terminal sequences of Mnk1 or Mnk2a and Mnk2b thus lacks the MAPK binding site.",

In cells that only, or mainly, contain Mnk1, the level of eIF4E phosphorylation will be determined by two factors. The first is the state of activation of the Erk or p38 MAP kinase pathways, which regulate the activity of Mnk1. The second is the level of eIF4F complexes which bring together eIF4E and the Mnks through their common binding partner, eIF4G. The level of eIF4F complexes is determined by factors such as amino acid availability and other stimuli, including growth factors and insulin. Thus, in HEK293 cells, agents such as the phorbol ester TPA, which activates Erk and increases eIF4F formation, increase the level of phosphorylation of eIF4E, while insulin, which increases eIF4F formation but does not activate Erk, does not increase eIF4E phosphorylation above its low basal level in these cells [48] .",

Firstly, this is likely to be relatively high in cells possessing significant levels of these kinases (provided they contain eIF4F complexes under a given condition). Secondly, the primary determinant of eIF4E phosphorylation in cells mainly expressing an Mnk2 isoform will be the level of eIF4F complexes, rather than increases in Erk/p38 MAP kinase activity. The requirement for eIF4F complex formation for efficient phosphorylation of eIF4E provides an input for amino acids/glucose (which enhance formation of such complexes [1] ) and well as for insulin, which in some cell types does not activate Erk, but does generally enhance formation of eIF4F complexes. Analysis of expression of RNAs encoding the different Mnks suggests that all three forms are expressed in all tissues tested, although expression levels of Mnk2a seem to be lower in brain, heart and ovary [33, 44] .

Given that stimuli that increase the rate of protein synthesis generally increase the state of phosphorylation of eIF4E, it was generally thought likely that phosphorylation would somehow activate eIF4E, e.g. perhaps increase its affinity for cap or capped mRNA. Minich et al. [49] were the first to try to address this important issue. Their work was performed before the identification of the Mnks, and they used chromatography on RNA-cellulose to separate phosphorylated from unphosphorylated eIF4E. The fraction of eIF4E that was not retained on this resin was found to consist only of the phosphorylated form, while the bound material was unphosphorylated. Using fluorescence methods, it was found that the fraction containing the phosphorylated eIF4E showed a three to four times higher affinity for m 7 GTP and for capped (globin) RNA. Two important caveats with this approach are that the basis of the resolution of these forms on RNA-Sepharose is quite unclear and that it is possible that one or other fraction was contaminated with other proteins that influence the affinity of eIF4E for RNA. For example, the 4E-BPs, which greatly increase the binding of eIF4E to cap [50] , were not known at this time and would in any case not have been detected by the methods used in their study.",

Scheper et al. [51] employed this approach. When the binding of eIF4E to cap analogue (m 7 GTP) was examined by fluorescence quenching, it was clear that phosphorylated eIF4E bound with lower affinity (2.5-fold difference) than the unphosphorylated protein [51] . Replacement of Ser209 by either of the two acidic amino acids, Glu or Asp, has almost no effect on the binding of eIF4E to m 7 GTP, indicating that a carboxylate group is a very poor mimic of phosphoserine in this case. Scheper et al. [51] also employed the surface plasmon resonance approach first described by von der Haar et al. [52] to examine binding of eIF4E to a capped oligonucleotide (i.e. one carrying m 7 GTP at its 5\u00a2-end). This ligand is immobilized by virtue of a biotin group at its 3\u00a2-end, which allows very tight binding to the streptavidin chip surface. Arguably, this capped oligonucleotide more accurately resembles the physiological ligand of eIF4E, capped mRNA. In this case, phosphorylation of eIF4E again reduced its affinity for the ligand (by about fivefold). Acidic mutations at Ser209 also decreased the affinity of eIF4E for capped oligonucleotide, although to a lesser extent than phosphorylation. In contrast, Shibata et al. [53] have reported that replacement of Ser209 by an acidic residue decreases release of eIF4E from cap, i.e. increases the affinity of eIF4E for this ligand.",

However, for technical reasons, Scheper et al. [51] were unable to test this directly. This finding can be explained in terms of the structure of eIF4E, since the region that binds 4E-BP1/eIF4G is remote from Ser209 in the 3D structure [28, 29, 50, 54] . Binding of 4E-BP1/eIF4G to eIF4E does greatly increase its affinity for capped RNA [50] . This effect is maintained for phosphorylated eIF4E, the difference in binding affinity between free or 4E-BP1-bound eIF4E between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of eIF4E being similar (although the absolute binding affinity is about 100-fold less for the free eIF4E in each case).",

[51] , which show the opposite effect. It is important to note that the original cocrystal structure of the unphosphorylated protein involved m 7 GDP rather than the complete cap structure or a capped oligonucleotide as ligand. Most significantly, the electron density around Lys159 was poorly defined and the actual structure around this residue was therefore unclear. More recent crystallographic studies by Tomoo et al. [55] and Niedzwiecka et al. [56] did include larger ligands (respectively m 7 GpppA and m 7 GpppG) and yielded better data for the structure around Lys159. This reveals that Lys159 is 12-19 \u00c5 away from Ser209, too far for formation of a salt bridge between Ser209(P) and Lys159, even given the likely flexibility of this region of the eIF4E molecule. The C-terminal loop containing Ser209 lies close to the second nucleoside (A in the structure of Tomoo et al.), with hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts between these residues and the ligand. The distance between Ser209 and the third phosphate group is substantially shorter than the distance between Ser209 and Lys159 (as determined by using PROTEIN EXPLORER Software (E. Martz, available at http://proteinexplorer.org and the PDB structure file deposited by Niedzwiecka et al. [56] available at http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb/). It may be that, by introducing additional negative charge in this region, phosphorylation at Ser209 creates electrostatic repulsion between the protein and the negatively charged nucleotide ligand, or the negatively charged third phosphate group of the capstructure, resulting in the weakened interaction observed in the biophysical studies of Scheper et al. [51] . It is notable that phosphorylation had a greater effect on binding to oligonucleotide than to m 7 GTP alone: this could suggest that the phosphate group at Ser209 weakens interactions between between eIF4E and phosphate groups in the body of the RNA as well as those within the cap-structure. However, no structural information is available for complexes of eIF4E with oligonucleotides larger than the m 7 GpppA/G ligand.",

The 7-methylated base lies deep within the capbinding slot and is intercalated between Trp56 and Trp102, the interaction being favoured by p-p stacking as indicated and the delocalized positive charge on the methylated guanine. Several other interactions stabilize the biding of the cap-structure, e.g. hydrogen bonds between the m 7 G moiety and Trp102, Glu103, and Trp166 and a direct interaction between the ribose and Trp56 (not indicated). Other direct interactions involve the phosphate groups of the ligand and Lys162 (not indicated), Arg157 and Lys159 (as indicated by grey lines). Trp166 and Arg112 make further contacts with the phosphates through water molecules (not indicated). (B) Reduced affinity of phosphorylated eIF4E upon phosphorylation.

Data from two such studies do indeed demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF4E cannot, by itself, drive formation of eIF4E/eIF4G complexes. Over-expression of Mnk1 in HEK293 cells [48, 57] or in cardiomyocytes [59] increased the phosphorylation of eIF4E without any rise in formation of eIF4E/eIF4G complexes. Forced increases in eIF4E phosphorylation also did not increase the overall rate of protein synthesis in these studies. These data are consistent with the notion that phosphorylation of eIF4E does not affect its interaction with eIF4G and indicates that it is also insufficient on its own to activate the translational machinery. Furthermore, insulin activates protein synthesis in HEK 293 cells without any effect on eIF4E phosphorylation, which remains very low [48] . This presumably reflects the fact that insulin does not significantly activate Erk in HEK293 cells. Thus, eIF4E phosphorylation does not seem to be essential for activation of protein synthesis at least by insulin (which, after all, does switch on a range of other translation factors [60] ). Although, changes in eIF4E phosphorylation and protein synthesis do correlate under a variety of conditions, there are a growing number of exceptions [62, 63] (reviewed by Kleijn et al. [61] ).",

Furthermore, they employed a specific inhibitor of the Mnks (CGP 57380) to block eIF4E phosphorylation and found no effect of this compound on cell proliferation, initiation factor complex formation or the ability of agents that activate the Erk pathway to stimulate protein synthesis. The authors argue that the inhibitory effect of Mnk activity on cap-dependent translation may act to limit translation under certain physiological conditions, although it is not clear how, and why, this would come about.

The first is a retardation of development and the second is reduced size of the adult animals. Body parts of Ser251fiAla flies are appropriately proportioned, and studies on the ommatidia of the compound eye suggest that major defect is in cell size rather than cell number.

Given that phosphorylation of eIF4E weakens its affinity for capped mRNA, it would be important for phosphorylation of eIF4E to occur only after the 48S complex had formed on the mRNA. This is achieved by the requirement for both the Mnk and eIF4E to be part of complexes with eIF4G in order for efficient phosphorylation of eIF4E to occur [45] . Reduced affinity of eIF4E for the cap-structure by phosphorylation of eIF4E prior to 48S formation would result in its release from the cap, i.e. too early in the initiation process to allow productive complex formation. It is also possible that eIF4G binds to eIF4E before it interacts with eIF3, but that the structure of eIF4F complexes that form prior to engagement of eIF3 does not favour eIF4E phosphorylation, and that binding of eIF4G to the 48S complex (via eIF3) triggers a change in the structure allowing phosphorylation of eIF4E. Phosphorylation of eIF4E, of course, requires that the Mnk associated with the ribosome to be active: in the case of Mnk1, for example, activity would be enhanced by triggering of the Erk or p38 MAP kinase pathways.",

Phosphorylation of eIF4E could function to enhance the release of factors from the cap-structure after 60S joining, rendering the capbinding factors available for the translation of different mRNAs. eIF4E was shown to be highly phosphorylated in 48S complexes [69] indicating that phosphorylation most likely occurs prior to 60S joining. Without eIF4E phosphorylation, eIF4E more likely remains at the cap during initiation. The mRNA must loop through the initiation complex (as depicted in diagrams F-H), further ribosomes are prevented from binding during scanning by the first 40S subunit. Binding of further ribosomes requires the completion of scanning by the first 43S complex, and this may impose a limit on the rate of translation initiation, especially for mRNAs with long 5\u00a2-UTRs or ones rich in secondary structure that has to be unwound to allow scanning. eIF4F complexes could remain attached to the RNA, maybe by stabilization mediated by binding of PABP, obviating the requirement to reassemble eIF4F. Studies using tethered eIF4E or eIF4G has shown that eIF4F complexes that are fixed in their position on the RNA, do allow initiation, but the authors could not address the question as to whether this process was as efficient as the noncovalent binding of eIF4F complexes as it occurs naturally [70, 71] .",

This may allow reinitiation of translation onto this mRNA, as indicated below diagram H. With an active Mnk within the complex, phosphorylation of eIF4E can occur but is proposed to be triggered late in the initiation process (perhaps due to conformational changes in the initiation factor complex), perhaps around the point where the anticodon of the Met-tRNA Met i locates the start codon (diagram I). The eIF4E would now be less likely to remain associated with the cap, and would become available to bind other mRNAs and facilitate the initiation of their translation (diagram K). The released eIF4F is thus now free to bind to other mRNAs. Some of these RNAs may be activated for translation by other mechanisms, thus enabling them to be efficiently translated. The mechanisms by which such mRNAs would be activated may include changes in the binding to modulatory proteins that either repress or facilitate their translation. There are many precedents for roles for proteins binding to the 5\u00a2-or 3\u00a2-UTRs of specific mRNAs in modulating their translation. One could postulate here that such mRNA-binding proteins might themselves also be regulated by phosphorylation. The p38 MAP kinase pathway (which leads to eIF4E phosphorylation) is known to regulate mRNA binding proteins involved in modulating the stability or translation of, e.g. cytokine mRNAs [72] . This kind of mechanism would be important in situations where some reprogramming of translation is required -i.e. a qualitative shift to allow the translation of previously inactive or poorly active mRNAs. Such reprogramming may be required for responses to proliferative stimuli or to cytokines, the types of stimuli that activate the Erk and/or p38 MAP kinase pathways. On the other hand, insulin, as an anabolic stimulus, may largely induce increased translation across the board of mRNAs that are already actively being translated.",

The answer may lie in their experimental protocol, which led to a forced increase in the phosphorylation of a high proportion of the cellular eIF4E, decreasing its affinity for capped mRNA. Under such conditions, the reduced affinity of phosphorylated eIF4E for capped mRNA will exert a negative influence on translation initiation without any positive input from increased availability of eIF4F complexes (which is not enhanced by eIF4E phosphorylation [57, 58] ).
