Besides, non-sensor derived images such as illustrations, data visualizations, figures, etc. are typically used to convey complex information or to explore large datasets. However, this kind of images has received little attention in computer vision. CNNs and similar techniques use large volumes of training data. Currently, many document analysis systems are trained in part on scene images due to the lack of large datasets of educational image data. In this paper, we address this issue and present SlideImages, a dataset for the task of classifying educational illustrations. SlideImages contains training data collected from various sources, e.g., Wikimedia Commons and the AI2D dataset, and test data collected from educational slides. We have reserved all the actual educational images as a test dataset in order to ensure that the approaches using this dataset generalize well to new educational images, and potentially other domains. Furthermore, we present a baseline system using a standard deep neural architecture and discuss dealing with the challenge of limited training data.",

In this case, we have classes such as pie charts and x-y graphs that indicate what type of information is in the image (e.g., proportions, or the relationship of two numbers) and how it is symbolized (e.g., angular size, position along axes).",

While certain classes are likely to be misclassified as another specific class (such as structured diagrams as slides), those relationships do not happen in reverse, and a correct classification is more likely.

To justify SlideImages, we have created a head-to-head comparison of classifiers trained in the same way (as described in Sect. 3.2) on the SlideImages and DocFigure datasets. All the SlideImages classes except slides have an equivalent in DocFigure. We have shown the reduction in the data used, and the relative sizes of the datasets, in Table 1 . The Head-to-head datasets contain only the matching classes, and in the case of the DocFigure dataset, the original test set has been split into validation and test sets. After obtaining the two trained networks, we have tested each network on both the matching test set, and the other test set. Although we were unable to reproduce the VGG-V baseline used by Jobin et al., we used a linear SVM with VGG-16 features and achieved comparable results on the full DocFigure dataset (90% macro average compared to their 88.96% with a fully neural feature extractor). The results ( Table 2) show that SlideImages is a more challenging and potentially more general task. The net trained on SlideImages did even better on the DocFigure test set than on the SlideImages test set. Despite having a different source and approximately a fifth of the size of the DocFigure dataset, the net trained on SlideImages training set was better on our test set.",
