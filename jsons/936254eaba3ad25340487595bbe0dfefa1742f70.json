Firstly, as in China, the dramatically evolving scenario of the epidemic in Italy required continuous structural, organisational and staff changes that exposed the study to maturation bias. In particular, the number of laboratory examinations performed upon admission was limited (i.e. Interleukine-6 determination became available only after 15 days from the start of the study). Secondly, only 14.8% of our patients underwent a chest computed tomography upon admission because of barriers in our infrastructure created in order to ensure a dedicated COVID-19 service. Thirdly, it was difficult to ascertain the different effects on outcomes of the miscellaneous and often concomitant drug treatments given to our patients because of the absence of a standard of care for COVID-19 (excluding oxygen supplementation). Nevertheless, as all of the patients admitted to our Infectious Diseases Department were enrolled in this study and the study population was probably representative of the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Italy in the early stage of the epidemic.",

Moreover, long term post discharge follow-up is warranted to provide a more accurate estimate of the morbidity and mortality attributable to this infection.",
