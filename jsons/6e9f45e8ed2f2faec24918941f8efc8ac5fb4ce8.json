            "text": "Houttuynia cordata Thunb. is a rhizomebearing aromatic medicinal herb and is restricted to specialized moist habitats. The plant is collected from natural habitats for local consumption and trade. The status of the species and its variations in physiological performance in different habitats were studied in selected sites of geographically different areas of Brahmaputra valley in eastern India. The surveys were conducted in two different growth stages of the plant during [2005][2006][2007]. The sites where the species was encountered were marked and a distribution map was prepared. The frequency and density of the plant was higher in the moist habitats with higher organic carbon (0.85 \u00b1 0.05%). Generally, the density, biomass production and growth had significant (P < 0.05) positive relationship with the soil physicochemical properties (linear curve fit). Soil moisture was the most dependent factor for the plant growth and the optimum growth was recorded at 78 \u00b1 5.6% (r 2 = 0.9; P \u2264 0.01). The physiological performance of the plant in all the studied sites were significantly varied (P < 0.05). The growth and development of H. cordata were also different in the flowering and senescence stages. Clay loam soil, average soil pH of 5.9, and 78% soil moisture were the favorable soil characteristics for the better growth of H. cordata and, hence, these data may be considered for conservation of the species.",

In Indo-China, the entire plant is considered for cooling, resolvent, and emmenagogue. The leaves are recommended for measles, dysentery, and gonorrhea and are used in the treatment of eye troubles, skin diseases, hemorrhoids, and in certain diseases of women. Some recent findings on its medicinal properties are antiinflammatory (Lu et al. 2006) , anti-allergic (Kim et al. 2007) , virucidal (Chiang et al. 2003) , antioxidative (Ng et al. 2007) , and anti-cancer (Chang et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2001 ). On steam distillation, the plant yields a light brown essential oil with a strong, somewhat disagreeable odor (Sarkar 1993) . About 22 different components were identified in the essential oil, among which n-decanoic acid (11%), \u03b1-terpineol (13%), \u03b2-myrcene (4%), 1-decanol (4%), and methyl nonyl ketone (35%) were the major components (Lu et al. 2006) .",

The steam distillate of fresh H. cordata could inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), influenza virus, and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) without showing cytotoxicity (Hayashi et al. 1995) .

            "text": "Along with such positive directions, there are some negative aspects regarding the conservation of the plant and its unique genetic pool. The World Health Organization estimates that some 80% of the developing world relies on traditional medicines and out of these, 85% people use plants or their extracts as the active substance (Sheldon et al. 1998) . In India, approximately 2,000 drugs are of plant origin (Dikshit 1999) . Present rapid socio-economic changes and several years of unregulated collection of the valuable medicinal plant species have resulted in the depletion of their populations and habitats in nature. Many of them have become rare and endangered and some species are on the verge of extinction (Kala 2000) . About 20-25% of existing plant species in India have become endangered (Laloo et al. 2006) . Ours is an era of profound changes on the surface of earth, driven by an unprecedented level of human demands on the resources of our planet (Gadgil et al. 1986 ). Degree of threat to natural populations of medicinal plants has increased, because more than 90% of the medicinal plant raw materials of Indian and export herbal industries are drawn from natural habitats (Dhar et al. 2002) . Over 70% of the plants collected by the pharmaceutical industries involve destructive harvesting. These patterns of use possess a definite threat to the genetic stock and to the diversity of medicinal plants. Threat assessment exercises as per latest IUCN guidelines for Southern and Northern India has already listed around 200 species of medicinal plants that are rare, endangered, and threatened. It is necessary to bear in mind that, even if a particular variety of a plant is put under several million hectares of active cultivation, the species can still go extinct in the wild if its wild populations with all their inherent intra-specific diversity is not conserved. It is an established fact that the evolution of the species depends on diversity (Shankar and Ved 2003) . But we can not deny the importance of uninterrupted supply of essential medicinal plants for the existence of pharmaceutical companies for the sake of public health. So the only way to restore human health as well as to decrease overexploitation is to encourage sustainable and discrete collection of medicinal plants from the wild. For this purpose, knowledge about distribution and ecological feature of the plants are necessary.",

Moreover, in CAMP workshops, only few species are assessed, mainly those placed before experts and most species are still non-assessed. Thus, it does not provide full information on the number of taxa under threat for a specific area (Kala 2000) . Presently, no quantitative information on availability in different populations of H. cordata is available in India, especially in Bhramaputra valley of Assam. But various tribes of Assam have been utilizing the plant as a vegetable as well as in various medicinal purposes traditionally (Sarkar 1993; Bora 2001) . Quantitative information on a species plays a vital role in formulating a conservation plan and in understanding the ecology of the species (Uniyal et al. 2002) .

The pooled quadrate information for each plot was used to analyze compositional features including frequency (F), density (D), abundance (A), and abundance-to-frequency ratio (A/F) (Misra 1968 ). All the populations were visited during the active growing season, i.e., flowering stage (April to July 2006) as well as in senescence stage (November-February 2006 for plant height and biomass estimation. Ten individuals from each population were selected randomly to measure the height of the aerial part of each individual at both flowering and senescence stages and their average heights were determined for each population and among all populations at both stages.",

The soil characteristics were the dependent factors for the growth of H. cortada in all the populations. The plant was only recorded in the moist habitats and therefore the soil physico-chemical properties were analyzed. The performance of H. cordata was maximum in JR where the soil moisture (78 \u00b1 5.6%) and organic carbon (0.85 \u00b1 0.05%) were also higher than other populations ( Table 3 ). The plant growth and soil characteristic had a significant positive correlation except in DH (linear curve fit; Fig. 5 ). Soil moisture was the most dependent factor of the plant growth and the optimum growth was recorded at 78 \u00b1 5.6% soil moisture (r 2 \u2265 0.9; P \u2264 0.01). However, the growth of the plant was not linear in different soil pH, hence, a linear curve was not fitted (r 2 \u2264 0.33; P \u2265 0.1). Higher soil organic carbon also favored the growth of the plant and was adequately linear in studied sites (r 2 \u2265 0.8; P \u2264 0.1). These data may indicate the optimum environmental parameters for the better growth of H. cordata and hence may be considered for conservation of the plant. Again, the area of DH is also well known for the annual heavy flood which may affect on the growth of the species in that area. The clay loam soil with maximum moisture and slightly acidic pH were favorable for growth and development of H. cordata (Fig. 6 ).",

This is probably because of lack of overexploitation or extensive harvesting of this medicinal herb, especially from this region. Additionally, the local people generally harvest only the aerial part of the herb to use as vegetable or as raw herbal medicine for various disorders. High density also reveals that the environment and soil quality is favorable for the luxurious growth and thick stocking of the herb in the region. \u2022 stand density; height (cm); above ground biomass (g/m 2 ); -\u2666-organic carbon (g/10 kg). Error bars are the standard deviations From the study, it can be assumed that the region is very much conducive for the in situ conservation and cultivation of the plant, if and when needed in the future. This is justified in view of the fact that luxurious availability, higher abundance and frequency as well as higher density of a species at present time do not pledge anything about its safe status in the near future. This is because of the growing demand of medicinal plants for the pharmaceutical companies. For instance, there was a large-scale commercial exploitation of medicinal plants from various districts of Himachal Pradesh (Sharma 1995) . In parts of Kulu district, 85% of families adjoining the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) meet 65-70% of their total annual cash income by medicinal plants trade (Singh 1999) . Over the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the quantity of medicinal plants sold in the market. About 61 kg of Aconitum violaceum and 1,468 kg of Picrorhiza kurrooa were collected from the entire state in 1988 -1989 (Sharma 1995 , whereas a total of 5,100 kg of A. violaceum and 8,350 kg of P. kurrooa were collected only from GHNP for selling in the market by local communities in 1998-1999 (Singh 1999) . Nearly 25% of the estimated 25,000 species of vascular plants in the world may become extinct within the next 50 years (Raven 1987; Schemske et al. 1994) . Red Lists of threatened plants are important tools for the conservation of threatened species (Berg et al. 1994) . However, comparison between assessments, before and after Rare Lists were formulated, is obscured by different categories and philosophies (Adsersen 1989; Oredsson 1997) .",

For longterm survival of populations, it is recommended that plants are harvested in the senescence stage when most of the reproductive stages are over (Bhatt et al. 2006 ). Therefore, this study suggests active cultivation of H. cordata in active growing season to cope with its greater demand.

The present study also recommends the active cultivation of the species in active growing season to decrease the pressure on natural population in reproductive stage to ensure the longterm sustainability of the species in this part of the world.
