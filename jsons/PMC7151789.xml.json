Systematic studies of common cold epidemiology using more sensitive diagnostic methods have not been done, although studies using PCR techniques in selected study populations and over limited time periods have generally confirmed the cell culture findings.6 The use of the more sensitive techniques, however, has permitted detection and characterization of previously unrecognized pathogens. Metapneumovirus, first detected in 2001, appears to be the cause of approximately 5% of common cold illnesses (see Chapter 161).7, 8 Bocavirus, a human parvovirus discovered in respiratory secretions in 2005, has since been detected in a small proportion (\u22485%) of children with respiratory disease (see Chapter 149).9, 10 This virus is frequently detected in patients who are coinfected with previously recognized respiratory pathogens or who are asymptomatic; thus, the role of bocavirus as a common cold pathogen has not been established.11, 12 The use of PCR assay has also revealed that coinfection by multiple viral pathogens is frequent during a common cold illness.13, 14\n",

However, pathogens other than rhinovirus or coronavirus are generally associated with the occurrence in the community of other clinical syndromes, such as croup or bronchiolitis, that are more characteristic of an epidemic pathogen. In tropical climates, the common cold is prevalent throughout the year, and the incidence has little correlation to climatic changes, although outbreaks of influenza and parainfluenza may be associated with rainy seasons.20, 21\n",

When inhaled, these aerosols may reach the lower airway. Large-particle aerosols refer to droplets generated from the airway that settle rapidly and are transmitted only over relatively short distances. These particles are generally filtered by the upper respiratory tract and are not deposited in the lower respiratory tract. Direct contact refers to contact with contaminated fomites as well as direct person-to-person contact. Studies of experimental and natural rhinovirus colds in human volunteers suggest that transmission may occur by both direct contact and by large-particle aerosols.28, 29 The transmission of the other pathogens associated with colds is less well studied. RSV appears to require close contact for spread and, under experimental conditions, has been spread by direct contact with contaminated fomites.30 In contrast to rhinovirus and RSV, influenza appears to spread from person to person predominantly by small-particle aerosols.31 Regardless of the mechanism of transmission, initiation of a common cold illness requires that the pathogen come in contact with, and infect, the nasal epithelium.",

The risk of infection on subsequent exposure to the virus appears to be related to the presence or absence of specific antibody to the pathogen. The frequency of infection with these viruses is due to the various mechanisms that the pathogens have evolved to avoid host defenses. Infections with rhinoviruses and adenoviruses result in the development of serotype-specific protective immunity. Repeated infections with these pathogens occur because there are a large number of distinct serotypes of each virus (see Table 58-1). Similarly, the influenza viruses behave as though there were multiple virus serotypes, by virtue of the changes of the antigens presented on the surface of the virus. The interaction of coronaviruses with host immunity is not well defined, but it appears that there are multiple distinct strains of coronavirus that are capable of inducing at least short-term protective immunity.32 In contrast, the parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, and RSV each have a small number of distinct serotypes. Reinfection with these viruses occurs because complete protective immunity to these pathogens does not develop after an infection. Although reinfection is not prevented by the adaptive host response to these viruses, the risk of infection is decreased, and the severity of subsequent illness is moderated by preexisting immunity.",

Despite these claims, there is no evidence that nonspecific depression of immune function plays any role in the risk of acquisition of infection or the severity of illness. Several studies have suggested that genetic polymorphisms that result in decreased concentrations of mannose-binding lectin may increase susceptibility to viral respiratory infection, particularly in young children.33, 34 The data are not conclusive, however, and the importance of polymorphisms in this component of the innate immune system remains to be determined.35\n",

The results of these studies range from dramatic reductions in common cold severity to no detectable effect.93 The studies that found no effect of zinc have been criticized as having small sample sizes, for using inadequate doses of zinc, or for using formulations of zinc that might inactivate the zinc salts. The studies reporting a significant effect of zinc have been criticized for inadequate blinding either by the use of poorly matched placebos, or because the active preparation was associated with a high incidence of adverse effects. Studies in the experimental rhinovirus colds model have consistently shown either no or relatively modest treatment effects of zinc preparations on common cold illness.94, 95, 96 The uncertain treatment effects of zinc must also be viewed in light of the side effects of this treatment.

There are three species of Echinacea with different phytochemical characteristics that are used for medicinal purposes. The phytochemical composition of Echinacea preparations may also vary because of differences in the part of the plant used, the type of extraction, and even the geographic location and time of year the plant is harvested. Despite the differences in the Echinacea preparations, only recently have there been attempts to standardize and characterize the material used in clinical trials. Many studies of Echinacea prevention or treatment of the common cold have been reported, but the lack of characterization of the product and inattention to careful study design limit the interpretation and generalizability of the results.97, 98 Although early studies suggested that Echinacea may have beneficial treatment effects, recent, more rigorous studies have failed to find any effect of Echinacea on common cold symptoms.99, 100 Given the variation in Echinacea products, the possibility that Echinacea preparations with different phytochemical profiles might be beneficial cannot be excluded. The accumulating evidence, however, suggests that it is prudent to assume that Echinacea has no beneficial effect until positive evidence of a treatment effect is produced.",

Immunization or chemoprophylaxis against influenza may be useful for prevention of colds caused by this pathogen; however, influenza is responsible for only a small proportion of all colds. Nonpharmacologic interventions touted as effective prophylaxis for the common cold include zinc; vitamins C, D, and E; Echinacea; ginseng; exercise; and hand hygiene. Unfortunately, when these interventions have been subjected to rigorous evaluation, evidence for effectiveness has not been found.99, 101, 102, 103 Hand hygiene and exercise have undeniable benefits for health in general and can be recommended despite the paucity of evidence specific to common cold prevention. The other interventions, although apparently safe, have no demonstrable benefit and simply contribute to the unnecessary health care expenditures related to the common cold.",
