In order to control these infections in a strategic manner, it is necessary to understand their prevalence and epidemiology in the cattle population. Although data exist indicating that BRSV and BCoV may persist within herds and that infections occur continuously (Collins et al., 1987, Heckert et al., 1991, Valarcher et al., 2001, Van der Poel et al., 1993), other studies have reported large intervals between infections, clearance of virus between outbreaks (Alenius et al., 1991, Elvander, 1996) and reintroduction of new strains (Larsen et al., 2000). The infections are most commonly detected during autumn and winter (Stott et al., 1980).",

In these cases, vaccination of seropositive adult cattle (to prevent re-excretion) and young stock (to prevent both disease and excretion) might be more beneficial. Vaccination procedures must in any case be preceded by prevalence studies so that optimal target age groups can be identified for vaccination and so cost-benefit estimates can be made.",

However, since actively acquired antibodies may remain detectable for years without re-infection (Alenius et al., 1991, Elvander, 1996), these studies mirror infections over long time periods. A more immediate picture can be given by using serology in a few young animals (6\u201318 months old) per herd \u2013 a method that has been proved to be useful for herd screening for acute BVDV infections in Denmark (Houe, 1992). Knowing that the respiratory viruses spread effectively within herds (Alenius et al., 1991, Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt, 1984), we extended the application of this method and used serology from young stock to monitor BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV infections on a herd level. The selected animals thus served as sentinels for infections introduced or circulating in studied herds.",

However, at least 74% of calves had experienced one or more of the infections at this time point. A substantial number of the calves that were seronegative in Spring seroconverted before the next sampling, suggesting a constant presence of na\u00efve young animals that render possible a continuous circulation of virus in the area. Accordingly, in some herds, seroconversions to BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV were observed in March to August, i.e., outside the peak period when clinical signs of disease caused by these infections are most often seen (Stott et al., 1980, Van der Poel et al., 1993).

These endemic infection patterns might be the result of: (i) new introduction of virus, (ii) continuous within herd virus circulation, (iii) re-excretion of virus from carrier animals, or (iv) a combination of these alternatives. Both within herd circulation and re-excretion of BRSV or BCoV remain hypotheses, since this has, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, not been described in animals that were strictly isolated. Although the data in the present study do not allow an extensive interpretation of the source of infections, a continuous within herd-circulation of virus at least did not occur in 49 and 34% of the herds, respectively, as these were classified as not infected with BRSV and BCoV on both sampling occasions.The geographical distribution of recently infected herds, with several clusters of herds in which seroconversions were detected, indicated a horizontal spread of virus. Since infections occurred in many herds that did not introduce new animals, the transmission was possibly indirect (e.g., with human, milk tanker or unknown vectors), or direct during pasture (possible contact between adjacent herds). Many authors underline the lability of BRSV in the environment (Stott and Taylor, 1985), but cell culture stocks of this virus has been reported to remain infective at 5 \u00b0C for 300 days (Tjornehoj, 2000) and re-isolation in vitro from contaminated surfaces has been demonstrated for human RSV (HRSV) after 6 h (Hall et al., 1980).",

Interestingly, 101 of 113 farmers (89%) estimated the average number of visitors with probable contact with other herds within the previous 24 h (excluding milk tanker drivers) to be more than two per month. These estimations were, however, not significantly correlated with our herd infection status. Collection of milk occurred in all herds and may have been involved in indirect transmission, reinforcing the potential role of visitors in the spread of infectious diseases. Further investigations need to be performed to evaluate the real impact of this mode of transmission. Careful precautions were undertaken to prevent spread of viruses with the researchers (disinfection of material/hands and change of clothing/boots between each herd).",

Although this finding might have been due to reduced contacts between animals from different herds on pasture or to increased distances for small vectors such as rodents; the possibility of airborne spread of BCoV between herds should be considered. Indeed, SARS-CoV is believed to have spread by air between buildings 60 m apart (Yu et al., 2004) and BCoV may spread by aerosol within buildings (Niskanen et al., 2002). Investigations on single infants have shown that small particle aerosol spread is unlikely for HRSV (Hall and Douglas, 1981); however, during an outbreak involving many na\u00efve individuals, virus shedding is probably many times greater and airborne spread of RSV should not be ruled out. Airborne transmission within a building has been documented for BRSV using a group of donor calves (Mars et al., 1999). The impact of wind spread is difficult to interpret in the field for viruses that are easily carried between herds by man and therefore also easily spread to more isolated herds.",

The exceptions from \u2018none seropositive\u2019 or \u2018all seropositive\u2019 in this study might have been due to infections in the herd before all calves were born, or to maternal antibodies in certain calves. Houe (1992) estimated the probability of obtaining at least two BVDV antibody positive animals in a test sample of three in a herd containing PI animals to be between 0.725 and 0.992. Activities within the BVDV program, such as removal of PI animals, probably affected the within-herd spread of BVDV in this study.",

This phenomenon can also have contributed to a possible underestimation of infected animals. In dairy calves, maternal antibodies to BRSV have been documented to remain until, on average, 3.3 months of age, up to a maximum of 7 months of age (Baker et al., 1986) and data from suckling beef cattle show a mean time to seronegative status of 6.2 (maximum 7.3), 6.3 (8.5) and 6.4 (7.9) months for BRSV, PIV-3 and BVDV, respectively (Fulton et al., 2004).",

Only 38% of sampled herds had BVDV antibody positive bulk tank milk, in contrast to a figure of 91% when the program was initiated in 1993. BVDV infected herds were at greater risk of being exposed to BCoV, possibly because these herds were managed in ways that lowered their level of biosecurity. The limited geographical spread of BVDV, however, demonstrates that the transmission of this virus is controllable. Influenza virus may also be involved in respiratory disease of cattle (Graham et al., 2002) and this will be the scope of further studies.",

The applied sampling strategy also allowed a surveillance of the spread of infections geographically on a herd level. Our findings inferred that dairy calves are already exposed to BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV at a young age and that a constant presence of seronegative animals supports the circulation of virus between herds throughout the year. The results suggest indirect spread, possibly in combination with latency or circulation of virus within herds. Further knowledge of viral epidemiology in the cattle population and modes of virus transmission is needed for successful applications of preventive measures. An increased effort should also be made to evaluate bovine vaccines in blinded, randomized field trials (Perino and Apley, 1998, Perino and Hunsaker, 1997).",
