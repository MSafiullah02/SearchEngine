Moreover, the anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effect of ruxolitinib on senescent cells, which are thought to be used by the virus to escape and alter the immune system, may be a key factor in the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with a poor prognosis, e.g., elderly patients [4].",

In the first case, the patient had high levels of inflammatory markers and poor respiratory function, which are indications for the use of tocilizumab [1], and was treated with ruxolitinib 7 weeks after first symptoms (the patient had received tocilizumab up until the week before). In the second case, ruxolitinib was given 13 days after onset of symptoms to a moderately stable patient to prevent worsening of symptoms. The timing of initiation of treatment with ruxolitinib and the severity of illness differed in these two patients; however, both patients were required to stop ruxolitinib treatment earlier than expected. This was because the first patient developed a soft-tissue infection and both patients developed cutaneous reactions with purpuras and a rapid drop in haematocrit values. Such side effects were probably worsened by the association with ritonavir, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, which may have increased ruxolitinib serum concentration [5].",
