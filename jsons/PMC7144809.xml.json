Zhou et al. conducted infectivity studies by\nincubating SARS-CoV-2 with HeLa cells of differential ACE2 receptor expression.1 The authors showed co-localization of the fluorescently stained viruses\nwith cells that express the ACE2 receptor from Chinese horseshoe bats, pigs, humans, and\ncivets, but not from mice. The ACE2 mRNA is present in almost all human organs. ACE2 is\npresent in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in the\nlungs, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, liver bile ducts, kidney\nparietal epithelial cells, and the brain. It is also expressed on the surface of lung\nalveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine that allows them to be\ninfected. Tissues of the upper respiratory tract (i.e.,\noral and nasal mucosa and nasopharynx) did not show surface expression of ACE2 on\nepithelial cells and therefore are unlikely the primary site of SARS-CoV-2\ninfection.22 CT scans may show higher opacity in the lower lungs\nbecause cells in that region express more ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from oral\nswabs, BAL fluid, and stool.1,23 Higher viral loads have been recorded in the nose\nversus the throat, with similar viral loads seen in asymptomatic and\nsymptomatic patients.24 Understanding the biological properties of\nSARS-CoV-2 enabled researchers to develop diagnostics for detection.",

Corman et al. aligned\nand analyzed a number of SARS-related viral genome sequences to design a set of primers\nand probes.35 Among the SARS-related viral genomes, they discovered\nthree regions that had conserved sequences: (1) the RdRP gene\n(RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) in the open reading frame ORF1ab region, (2) the\nE gene (envelope protein gene), and (3) the N gene\n(nucleocapsid protein gene). Both the RdRP and E genes\nhad high analytical sensitivity for detection (technical limit of detection of 3.6 and\n3.9 copies per reaction), whereas the N gene provided poorer analytical\nsensitivity (8.3 copies per reaction). The assay can be designed as a two-target system,\nwhere one primer universally detects numerous coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and a\nsecond primer set only detects SARS-CoV-2.",

Lateral flow antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 is one point-of-care\napproach under development for diagnosing COVID-19.76 In commercial\nlateral flow assays, a paper-like membrane strip is coated with two lines: gold\nnanoparticle-antibody conjugates are present in one line and capture antibodies in the\nother. The patient\u2019s sample (e.g., blood and\nurine) is deposited on the membrane, and the proteins are drawn across the strip by\ncapillary action. As it passes the first line, the antigens bind to the gold\nnanoparticle-antibody conjugates, and the complex flows together through the membrane. As\nthey reach the second line, the complex is immobilized by the capture antibodies, and a\nred or blue line becomes visible. Individual gold nanoparticles are red in color, but a\nsolution containing clustered gold nanoparticles is blue due to the coupling of the\nplasmon band. The lateral flow assay has demonstrated a clinical sensitivity, specificity,\nand accuracy of 57%, 100%, and 69% for IgM and 81%, 100%, and 86% for IgG, respectively. A\ntest that detects both IgM and IgG yields a clinical sensitivity of 82%.76 Nucleic acid testing can also be incorporated into the lateral flow assay.\nPreviously, a RT-LAMP test was combined with lateral flow readout to detect\nMERS-CoV.78 These tests are single use and suffer from poor\nanalytical sensitivity in comparison to RT-PCR. To improve the assay readout signal,\nresearchers have developed a variety of signal amplifying techniques\n(e.g., thermal imaging and assembly of multiple gold\nnanoparticles).79",

Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing\nan important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from\nthe 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection.\nTransmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome\nsequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to\nhelp design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same\ntechniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks.104 The rapid\nidentification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic\nacid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next\nstep being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer\nand may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call\nfor development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are\nstraddling phases 2 and 3 (Figure 3) such as\nisothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further\ndeveloped so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an\noutbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater\ncommunication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the\ntoolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct\nresources and efforts to patients with COVID-19. This process can curb the spread of\ninfectious pathogens and reduce mortality.",
