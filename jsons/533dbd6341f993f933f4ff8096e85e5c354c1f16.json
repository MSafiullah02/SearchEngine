No evidence of joint inflammation or neurological deficit of the lower extremities was present. MRI of the cervical spine revealed a soft tissue pannus mass about the dens process impressing on the spinal cord ( Fig. 1) . Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), Forestier's disease, with secondary fusion below C2, was found to be the underlying aetiology. While the differential diagnosis of a peridental mass with cystic lesion at the C1-C2 levels includes arachnoid, fibrous, ependymal, teratomatous, perineural and meningial cysts, peridental masses have also been detected in patients with rheumatic conditions. Patients with RA with dens erosions and subaxial cervical instability, CPPD with dens involvement ('crowned dens') and synovial cysts of the spine have been reported. Very few patients with peridental masses and DISH have been reported, and only in the neurosurgical literature [1] . These masses may develop in such cases due to enhanced mechanical stress at C1-C2 as the only mobile joint, due to fusion below C2 secondary to DISH. Our patient underwent neurosurgical decompression and C1-C2 Harm's fusion, with neurological improvement and disappearance of the peridental mass on repeat MRI.
