Thus, in patients with cancer, the utility of intervention must be weighed against the risk for inadvertent COVID-19 exposure in the health care system, especially during the initial weeks of the pandemic, when the risk for viral dissemination cannot be quantified and remains largely unknown.",

The Figure provides guidance for nonspecialists in oncology about the effects of delayed diagnosis or treatment in common cancer scenarios. Many solid tumors (such as lung or pancreatic cancer) and some hematologic cancers (such as acute leukemia) require immediate diagnosis and treatment. However, other common early-stage cancers (breast, prostate, cervical, nonmelanoma skin) may not. The quality of evidence in some cases is inadequate to support \u201cone size fits all\u201d statements applicable to every patient. However, experienced oncology providers should feel confident exercising judgment regarding which patients need to initiate or continue treatment owing to their tumor's more aggressive biology versus those who can\ntolerate a delay. Decision making may change as efforts by the health care system to mitigate risks for exposure to COVID-19 improve (5). Indeed, consensus recommendations swiftly began to appear to help providers make appropriate triage decisions (6). For persons with advanced oncologic disease, futility of treatment in the context of COVID-19 must be frankly considered and discussed.",

Nationally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has expanded telehealth benefits for Medicare beneficiaries during the outbreak, a decision that will allow individuals to receive health care services without traveling to a health care facility.

During the COVID-19 crisis, cancer care utilization of ward and intensive care unit beds, ventilators, pharmaceuticals, blood products, staff, and basic medical supplies may directly conflict with care delivery for those with COVID-19. A new cancer diagnosis is frightening for patients and families. Although most cancer care is not typically considered \u201celective,\u201d as resource constraints grow owing to supply chain issues, variations in geographic needs, and reallocation of medical infrastructure to care for infected patients, difficult tradeoffs will need to be made. Education of providers and patients can help in this setting.
