Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients.",

Neutrophils possess a powerful strategy that serves as primary strategy against pathogens denominated neutrophil-extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are basically complex structures released from neutrophils containing genetic material and proteases that capture and kill microorganisms (Brinkmann et al., 2004) , but also play an important role in sustaining inflammatory environments such as those observed in inflammatory bowel disease (Dinallo et al., 2019 ) . An important NET component is elastase, a protease that acts over several proteins and substrates, mainly other proteases and extracellular matrix components. This protease is detectable at higher concentrations during pulmonary inflammation, and our hypothesis is that elastase can act over SARS-CoV-2 proteins releasing proinflammatory peptides.",

            "text": "To this end, a computational approach was proposed based on our knowledge predicting the immunomodulatory potential of microbial extracellular peptides (Blanco-M\u00edguez et al., 2016) . The proposed method combines an in silico digestion with machine learning and sequence alignment techniques ( Figure 1 ). First, all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were in silico digested by the elastase action allowing one missed cleavage (see Methods). Then, we applied an ensemble learning strategy, combining 50 independent random forest models, including amino acid, dipeptide, composition-transition-distribution, physicochemical properties, and amino acid index, to predict the proinflammatory potential of the elastase-produced peptides (Manavalan et al., 2018) (Supplementary Table 1 ). To further check the capability of such peptides to induce a B / T Cell response, the 153 predicted proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) were aligned against the potential B and T cell epitopes reported by Grifoni et al. (Grifoni et al., 2020 ) (see STAR methods) . This led to a subset of sixteen PIPs, from which nine were found exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2 and five present also in the SARS-CoV, but not in other human coronaviruses, i.e. MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 (Table 1; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Interestingly, all of the SARS-CoV-2 exclusive PIPs showed homology only against T-cell epitopes, agreeing with previous studies suggesting that the underlying mechanism behind the virus' pro-inflammatory response was related to T cell activation (Ong et al., 2020) . Moreover, 78 percent of these SARS-CoV-2 exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, the second most abundantly expressed transcript of the virus (Kim et al., 2020) . This finding suggests that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate from the outer and therefore accessible spike glycoproteins (Chu et al., 2020) . High production of these spike PIPs might be related to the excessive pulmonary inflammation observed in the patients .",
