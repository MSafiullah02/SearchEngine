With several reports suggesting potential myocardial damage in patients with COVID-19 1 , cardiologists and especially cardiac imaging services are also facing the challenge of this pandemic. The American Society of Echocardiography has recently published recommendations regarding echocardiography during the current pandemic, and stated that need for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be carefully evaluated and when necessary performed with special caution\u00b2. However, despite careful screening and deferral of nonurgent cases, in some situations the TEE is indispensable to guide diagnosis and further treatment. TEE is an aerosol and droplet producing examination and thus for the examiner it bears a high risk for exposure and infection. Because access to standard personal protective equipment (PPE) is not ensured everywhere, we have recently designed the mobile protective shield to increase protection for examiners during TEE. It is made by two pieces of acrylic glass mounted on a metal frame. The two pieces of acrylic glass are connected by two screws embedded in a slot. In this way the small shield can glide vertically, and the height of the protective shield can be adjusted individually (A).",
