            "text": "Fish meal is generally considered to represent the \u201cgold standard\u201d dietary protein source for carnivorous fishes. However, even though the animal feedstuffs and competing industries have increased demands for fish meal, global production of this commodity has remained relatively stable over the last decade, and supplies are unlikely to improve (FAO, 2004). Indeed, the increasing scarcity of suitable protein sources for human consumption may result in the use of industrial fish for the plate resulting in a further weakening in supplies (Craig and McLean, 2005). Already, aquafeeds account for > 50% of variable operating costs of intensive aquaculture operations, with protein representing the most costly feed ingredient (Bassompierre et al., 1997). If aquaculture is to continue to expand to meet global demands for seafood products, development of cost-effective and sustainable dietary formulations will be mandatory (Catacutan and Pagador, 2004). This only can occur through significant reductions in the dependence of the aquafeed industry upon fish meal supplies.",

            "text": "Because fish meal represents a finite resource and as it has become more expensive over time (FAO, 2004), it is not surprising to find that the aquafeed industry has sought out alternative, less expensive, protein sources. For alternative or supplemental proteins to be useful however, they must possess certain characteristics. Alternative proteins must be competitively priced relative to fish meal on a unit protein basis. They cannot negatively impact fish performance (digestibility, growth, disease resistance, etc.) or product quality and must be commodities (i.e., traded internationally) (Hardy and Tacon, 2002). As well, alternative proteins must not be environmentally degrading with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus discharge and should be easily handled, stored and amenable to pelleting. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, there exists, at present at least, only a limited number of potential candidates. These include the pulses, oilseeds, grains, rendered animal meals, processing discards and fishery by-catch. Soybean meal in particular represents one of the most widely used alternate protein sources employed by aquaculture, due to its global distribution, cost, relatively high digestibility, good amino acid profile and high protein content (Storebakken et al., 2000). Nevertheless, soybean and other alternative protein meals each contain a variety of anti-nutritional factors that negatively impact production performance of cultured fish (Francis et al., 2001).",

            "text": "An issue of more recent concern relates to that of biosecurity and food safety. Western consumers have, due to enhanced education and increased access to scientific and media services, become more sophisticated in their purchasing decisions. In an age of bioterrorist threat, outbreak of unusual z\u00f6onoses (e.g., transmissible bovine spongiform encephalitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome), increasing health concerns related to chemical contaminants (Hites et al., 2004) and the advent of genetically modified organisms, more attention than ever before is being given to food quality and safety (Reid et al., 2004). This shift in consumer eating patterns has stimulated production of organic foods. As of the early 1980s, aquaculture represented the world's fastest-growing food production sector. However, since 1999, for many countries organic agriculture has supplanted aquaculture's position as the leading food production growth industry (FAO, 1999, El-Hage Scialabba and Hattam, 2002). This trend continues on a global basis and includes a growing organic aquaculture segment. Interest in organic aquaculture is based primarily upon the potential profitability of the organic sector (Craig and McLean, 2005). Although no official statistics are available with respect to organic aquaculture production, estimates suggest that in 2000 it did not exceed 5000 tons, which represents 0.01% of global aquaculture output (Bergleiter, 2001). This negligible quantity of certified aquaproduce underscores the difficulties inherent in achieving organic aquaculture standards. The principal problem encountered relates to sourcing organic feed and nutrient resources (Tacon and Pruder, 2001). Based on current estimates of certified organic aquaculture production and anticipated growth of the industry, it has been predicted that organic aquaculture harvests will achieve 1.2 million tons by 2030 (El-Hage Scialabba and Hattam, 2002). If such an increase is to be realized however, new sources of certifiable feeds must be found. The search for organically certified alternate proteins, especially for carnivorous species, represents a greater challenge than securing alternative proteins alone. The present study was initiated with this in mind. The carnivorous cobia was used as an experimental animal whereas organically certified yeast-based proteins were employed as the alternative protein source.",

Debate continues to surround the certifiability of by-catch from commercial fisheries, as well as by-products and processing wastes from aquaculture, fish and meat processing industries as organic aquafeed ingredients. Moreover, questions remain regarding the palatability and amino acid availability of such products (Li et al., 2004a). Challenges also are met when considering vegetable protein sources, especially for use in feeds for higher level carnivores such as cobia. Most plant proteins harbor anti-nutritional factors and have low biological value due to essential amino acid deficiencies and/or imbalances and poor digestibility (Hardy, 1996, Francis et al., 2001). These issues may be amplified with organically certified plant proteins where delayed field operations, poor soil moisture, competition by weeds, and reduced mineralization of organically certified manures throughout a growing season, may each severely impact crop production and quality. Moreover the risks of contamination of organic crops, especially for grains and pulses, by traditional and genetically modified harvests, are of serious concern (Hanson et al., 2004). The use of fermentation technologies for the production of single cell-based products surmounts all the preceding problems besides providing a totally biosecure production environment.",

            "text": "The present investigation demonstrates that, at a minimum, 25% of the fish meal component in cobia diets can effectively be replaced by the yeast-based protein source utilized in the present study without any negative consequences to animal performance. Concurrently, these studies represent the first demonstration of fish meal replacement with an organically certified alternate protein in cobia feeds. It is highly likely that the level of this yeast-based protein source could be increased substantially since cobia production characteristics only began to decrease following 50% inclusion rate of the yeast-based protein source. These results are thereby similar to observations for other species of juvenile carnivorous fish in which fish meal was replaced using yeast-based products by 30\u201350% without negative impact (Beck et al., 1976, Rumsey et al., 1990, Oliva-Teles and Goncalves, 2001). Only two other studies have examined fish meal replacement in cobia diets; both used traditional soybean meal and were able to achieve 40% substitution without detrimental effects upon cobia weight gain and feed conversion (Chou et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005). Juvenile cobias fed the diet containing 100% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source were severely compromised with respect to all production and biological parameters examined, returning low weight gain response, reduced FCR values and poor survival. One reason underlying the decreased performance of animals fed the 100% yeast-based diet was most likely product palatability. It was observed that there was a significant amount of feed remaining in the tanks assigned to the 100% yeast-based diet after feeding. Although feed intake was not directly measured, this observation indicates that palatability was poor in this diet. Additionally, amino acid analysis of the diets did not indicate a severe nutrient deficiency with respect to essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine. Likewise, the significantly reduced biological indices (lower VSI, HSI, muscle and liver lipid) in fish fed this diet can be attributed to their extremely low growth rates. It appears that for cobia and other marine carnivores, a blend of alternate protein sources will be required if fish meal is to be effectively replaced without negative impact upon production performance (Craig and McLean, 2005).",
