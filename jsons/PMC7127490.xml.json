The etiological agent was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) [2\u2022\u2022, 3, 4] and the genome sequence established it as a novel member of the family [5, 6]. This novel CoV has satisfied Koch's postulates for causation, including the consistent detection of the virus and an antibody response to the virus in patients with SARS [2\u2022\u2022] and the reproduction of the disease in non-human primates after experimental inoculation [7, 8]. Previous reviews have addressed issues on the clinical presentation [9], aetiology and laboratory diagnosis [10], epidemiology and viral genetics [11], vaccines and therapeutics [1, 12], and public health [13]. Here we will focus on the host\u2013pathogen interaction, including tropism of SARS-CoV, viral entry into host cells, innate and adaptive immune responses, and host genetic susceptibility to SARS.",

Serological evidence of infection in raccoon dogs and humans in the same market was also found, supporting a zoonotic origin of SARS. The animal CoV isolates were different from the human SARS-CoV in that they had an additional 29-nucleotide sequence not found in most human isolates. This additional 29-nucleotide sequence in the animal CoV results in merging opening reading frames (ORF) 10 and 11 into a new ORF encoding a putative protein of 122 amino acids of unknown biological significance. How the precursor animal CoV adapted itself in humans to achieve efficient man-to-man transmission remains unknown, but molecular epidemiological study of SARS-CoV has suggested that several introductions of the animal CoV into humans had occurred, with only the one with the 29-nucleotide deletion associated with the subsequent outbreak in Hong Kong spreading globally [15]. Phylogenetic analysis of the few human cases in Guangdong in December 2003 revealed that this SARS-CoV is much closer to the palm civet CoV than to any human SARS-CoV detected in the epidemic in early 2003 [16]. This again strengthens the contention that SARS is of zoonotic origin, and that the wet markets serve as a continuing source of SARS-CoV crossing species \u2014 from animals to humans [17].",

Apart from the pneumonia, 38% and 73% of patients, respectively, had diarrhoea in two separate cohorts of patients [19, 20]. Despite the active viral replication in the enterocytes, there is minimal disruption of the intestinal architecture or cellular infiltrate, and the mechanism of pathogenesis of the diarrhoea remains unclear. The absence of intestinal inflammation and destruction has been speculated to be a result of upregulation of potent immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-\u03b2 [21] and an antiapoptotic host cellular response in the intestinal epithelial cells respectively [1].",

Using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to examine 19 fatal SARS cases, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in lung, small and large bowels, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, heart, kidney and skeletal muscle, in descending order of viral load per gram of tissue [23]. These findings suggest that SARS is a systemic disease with widespread extrapulmonary dissemination, resulting in viral shedding in respiratory secretions, stools, urine and possibly even in sweat [22, 23]. The organ damage in patients with SARS could be due to both local viral replication and the immunopathologic consequences of the host response, hence it is important to delineate what human cells the SARS-CoV can infect and replicate in as well as the subsequent host immune response.",

After binding to ACE2 on the target cells, the transmembrane S protein changes conformation by association between the HR1 and HR2 regions to form a six-helix oligomeric complex, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV S2 fusion-protein core provides a framework for the design of entry inhibitors [30].",

Human CD209L (also known as liver/lymph-node-specific [L]-SIGN), which is 77% identical to human DC-SIGN, can also bind to S protein and mediate virus entry [32\u2022] but its role in initiating productive virus replication remains unclear.",

This localization of ACE2 explains the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV for the lung, small intestine and kidney; however, notable discrepancies include virus replication in colonic epithelium, which has no ACE2, and no virus infection in endothelial cells, which have ACE2. Other receptors or co-receptors such as L-SIGN may explain such discrepancies. Since only the basal layer of the non-keratinized squamous epithelium of the upper respiratory tract expresses ACE2, undamaged epithelium of the nasopharynx is not likely to support SARS-CoV replication. This raises the interesting possibility that a preceding infection by another pathogen may expose the basal layer and facilitate SARS-CoV infecting the damaged upper respiratory tract before spreading to involve the lung.",

It may be relevant that SARS-CoV infection of human macrophages in vitro leads to initiation of viral replication and viral protein synthesis without a detectable type-1 interferon response [35]. Furthermore, in marked contrast to patients with influenza, there was a lack of expression of mRNA for the type-1 interferons, interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with SARS [36]. On the other hand, other innate immune defences such as the collectins that can bind the glycosylated SARS-CoV S protein may play an important role in host defence. Such collectins include the lung surfactant proteins A and D as well as the mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which is present in serum. In a case-control gene-association study of 569 Hong Kong Chinese SARS patients and 1188 healthy controls, low-MBL-producing genotypes have been shown to be associated with increased risk of SARS [37\u2022]. Moreover MBL can bind SARS-CoV, resulting in protective biological effects in a calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion, suggesting the binding is through the carbohydrate-recognition domains of MBL with the S protein. Plasma proteomic analysis of four patients revealed active innate immune responses to SARS-CoV, including increased acute-phase proteins such as serum amyloid A, and C-type lectins such as MBL and tetranectin [38\u2022]. These observations suggest that MBL plays a protective role against development of SARS.",

Moreover beige, CD1\u2212/\u2212, or RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice cleared SARS-CoV normally. These observations suggest proinflammatory chemokines may co-ordinate a highly effective innate antiviral response in the lung, and NK cells and adaptive cellular immunity are not required for viral clearance in this species [41]. On the other hand, Stat-1 appears to contribute to host defence in SARS-infected mice [42]. Deficiency of Stat-1 leads to resistance to the antiviral effects of interferons and this may be relevant to the above observation.",

Overexpression of 7a, a protein specifically encoded by SARS-CoV, can induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway and in cell lines derived from different organs, including lung, liver and kidney.

S(GD03T0013) depends much less on ACE2 as receptor for cell entry and is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization in comparison to eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003. Moreover, antibodies that neutralize most human S proteins can enhance entry mediated by the palm civet virus S proteins [54]. This underscores the need to address the evolving diversity of SARS-CoV for vaccine development; progress in experimental vaccine candidates for SARS has been previously reviewed [1]. Insight into the mechanisms of antibody-dependent enhancement will help to avoid complications during vaccine development. The inability to maintain, using in vitro culture, the animal SARS-CoV precursor virus from palm civets makes it difficult to confirm whether these findings with pseudotyped virus are relevant to infectious SARS-CoV-like virus isolates. An alternative approach will be to address this question using techniques of SARS-CoV reverse genetics, which are now becoming available.",

Although the kinetics and protective role of the host antibody responses are better defined, the roles of the adaptive cell-mediated and the innate immune responses to SARS are still being unravelled. Empirical approaches to vaccine development are progressing rapidly but it remains important to better elucidate the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis so as to minimize the risk of being unpleasantly surprised by unintended consequences of vaccination.",

SARS CoV induced the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 in 293 cells but it was proposed that the lack of an interferon response is due to a block in subsequent dimerization and hyper-phosphorylation of IRF-3.",
