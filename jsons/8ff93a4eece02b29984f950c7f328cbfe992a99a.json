The pulmonary lesions often occur in the hilum of the lung and then spread around, resulting in the lobular pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia. Via microscopic examination, infi ltration of the mononuclear lymphocytes can be discovered in the alveolar wall and interstitial tissue; deciduous epithelial cells, fi brous protein, lymphocytes, and few neutrophils can be found in the pulmonary alveoli; the inclusion bodies and pathogens can be seen in the cytoplasm of the macrophage in the exudation of pulmonary alveoli. SARS and lobular pneumonia often occur. In severe cases, necrosis of lung tissue may occur accompanying pleurisy. Beside the lung, relative lesions can be found in other involved organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, meninges, cardiac muscles, and endocardium.",
