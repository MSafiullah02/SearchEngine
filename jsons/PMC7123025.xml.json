            "text": "Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that is synthesized in humans upon solar UVB (290\u2013315 nm) mediated conversion of endogenous skin 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (MacLaughlin et al., 1982), and is also derived from food and dietary supplements. During the winter when adequate sunlight is limited for synthesis, there is greater dependency on dietary intake and thus the term \u2018vitamin\u2019 meaning essential nutrient was applied to this sunshine-derived hormone. Since vitamin D occurs naturally in a limited number of foods, fortified foods such as milk and milk products, margarines, and breakfast cereals constitute the major dietary sources of the two forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) in the US and Canada (Calvo et al., 2004). After absorption or synthesis, vitamin D2 or D3 is transported by vitamin D binding protein to the liver where the enzyme 25-hydroxylase converts it to 25(OH)D. This intermediary metabolite circulates and delivers the precursor to the active or hormonal form of vitamin D to different tissues. In this capacity, plasma 25(OH)D serves as the main status indicator for vitamin D. The mitochondrial enzyme, 1\u03b1-hydroxylase converts 25(OH)D to the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D (Holick, 2007). Renal tissues are thought to be the major source of circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2D, but most extra-renal tissues including the immune and airway epithelial cells constitutively or upon activation express 1\u03b1-hydroxylase and can produce 1,25(OH)2D (Hansdottir and Monick, 2011).",

While its classical role in bone mineralization is well documented, the interplay of non-rachitic vitamin D status to in utero and post-natal health outcomes such as susceptibility to early-life respiratory infections continues to evolve. In this chapter, we review the current public health concern about vitamin D status in infants and toddlers in North America, the dietary guidelines and Federal regulations governing the level of vitamin D in foods and supplements during pregnancy and early childhood, and examine the evidence for association between poor vitamin D status and risk of respiratory infections in infants and toddlers.",

            "text": "Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is global and widely prevalent, and can be attributed to inadequate vitamin D intake and restricted sunlight exposure during winter months compared to summer months, northern latitudes, and higher melanin levels in dark-skinned or veiled women. Based on a National Human Activity Pattern Survey it has been estimated from the outdoor-sunlight data that US women including those of child-bearing age (22\u201340 years) get lower annual UVB doses than males because they spend less time outdoors (Godar, 2001; Godar et al., 2001). In the US, 29 % of African-American pregnant women and 5 % of Caucasian pregnant women residing in the northern latitudes are vitamin D deficient (defined as serum 25(OH)D less than 37.5 nmol/l); whereas 54 % of African-American participants and 47 % of Caucasian participants are vitamin D insufficient (defined as serum 25(OH)D 37.5-80 nmol/l) (Bodnar et al., 2007). Moreover, 18 % of pregnant women in the United Kingdom, 25 % in the United Arab Emirates, 80 % in Iran, 42 % in northern India, 61 % in New Zealand and 60-84 % of pregnant non-Western women in the Netherlands have been shown to have serum 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/l (Dawodu and Wagner, 2007). Thus, there is concern that in utero vitamin D deficits could lead to developmental re-programming of body functions and long-term morbidity in infants, children and adults.",

A comprehensive assessment of 25(OH)D serum data from participants in NHANES 2001\u20132006, one year of age and over, after adjusting for age and season, showed that males are less likely to be at risk of deficiency (<30 nmol/l) than females (Figure 16.2) and the prevalence of those at risk of inadequacy (30\u201349 nmol/l) did not differ by sex. However, in the 2001\u20132006 NHANES cohort, among women of childbearing age, those who were pregnant or lactating were less likely to be at risk of deficiency compared to women who were not pregnant or lactating (Figure 16.2) and no differences in prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy were observed between the two groups (Looker et al., 2011). These prevalence data reflect 24 hr recall levels of vitamin D intake, which suggests that pregnant and lactating women in general in the US are in compliance with the current dietary guidelines for maintaining vitamin D status or have adequate sun exposure. A rigorous analysis of current NHANES data is needed to determine the association of vitamin D status with sun exposure and total \u2018usual\u2019 dietary intake for individual race/ethnicities, since smaller cross-sectional studies have shown association of maternal deficiency, race (African-American), winter birth, and a BMI of \u226535 as risk factors for newborn vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\n",

            "text": "During pregnancy the fetus is wholly dependent on the mother for vitamin D, and 25(OH)D readily crosses the placenta such that cord blood 25(OH)D levels are between 80 % and 100 % of maternal concentrations (Fleischman et al., 1980; Gertner et al., 1980; Hillman and Haddad, 1974). There is a strong correlation between maternal and newborn 25(OH)D circulating levels as the half-life of 25(OH)D is approximately 2 to 3 weeks, and a low maternal status often results in the infant being deficient in vitamin D during the first weeks post-partum (Hollis and Wagner, 2004a; Yu et al., 2009). Because vitamin D secretion in breast milk is limited (Kovacs, 2008), lactating women require robust serum 25(OH)D levels to support vitamin D status in nursing infants (Hollis and Wagner, 2004b). The World Health Organization recommends supplementation with 400-IU daily vitamin D to all pregnant women; however, because of lack of awareness and poor compliance, 46 % of newborns in industrialized countries are born with insufficient serum levels of 25(OH)D (Belderbos et al., 2011).",

            "text": "More recently Balk and the Council on Environmental Health and Section on Dermatology recommended that children younger than 1-year of age avoid direct sunlight and also use sunscreen (Balk, 2011). Furthermore, for reasons that are not entirely clear, data suggest that the relationship between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D levels is non-linear (Hypponen et al., 2009), and current guideline levels for vitamin D supplementation (200\u2013600 IU/d) are unlikely to achieve optimal serum 25(OH)D levels (IOM, 2011). In a study of 40 mother-infant pairs, 76 % of mothers and 81 % of newborns had a 25(OH)D level below 50 nmol/l at the time of birth, despite the fact that during pregnancy the mothers ingested about 600 IU/d of vitamin D from a prenatal supplement and consumed two glasses of milk (Lee et al., 2007). Thus, it is understandable that infants who are fed only human breast milk are prone to developing vitamin D deficiency leading to a Federal mandate both in the United States and Canada to fortify infant formula with vitamin D at 40\u2013100 IU/kcal and 40\u201380 IU/kcal, respectively. The effectiveness of infant formula fortification was evident in a cross-sectional study of 247 healthy infants in a primary care setting in Boston as breastfeeding without supplementation markedly increased the odds of vitamin D deficiency compared with infants who were exclusively formula (bottle)-fed (Gordon et al., 2008). Interestingly, although maternal supplementation of 200-IU/d vitamin D was available to all nursing mothers, there may be barriers to obtaining the supplement or lack of awareness of the need to supplement, which resulted in poor compliance. Thus, with emerging data on insufficiency in vitamin D levels with the IOM 1997 recommendation of 200 IU/d, the revised recommendation is now set at 600 IU/d for infants in the United States and Canada (IOM, 2011).",

Recent estimates from everyday outdoor exposure suggest that children (\u22645 years) in the northern (45\u00b0N) (Figure 16.3a) and southern (35\u00b0N) (Figure 16.3b) United States with Fitzpatrick Type II skin (Caucasian) (Fitzpatrick, 1988) can have adequate skin synthesis of vitamin D3 during the summer and children living in the south during the spring as well but only if they do not wear sunscreen at all except during beach vacations. Children with Fitzpatrick Type III and IV skin (olive tone-Hispanic/Asian or brown tone-Indian, respectively) can only synthesize the suggested minimum daily recommendation during the summer months, while those with the darkest pigmentation (skin type V and higher, usually African-Americans) never make the suggested minimum amount of vitamin D3 from sun exposure (Godar et al., 2012). These vitamin D3 estimates from solar exposures assume certain skin types, liberal clothing scenarios during each season and that sunscreens are not worn except during beach vacations. These could be overestimates for infants and toddlers since mothers tend to be overly protective of their children to avoid skin cancer later in life or could be a result of children spending more time indoors watching television. Despite the fact that younger children are spending more time indoor, children in the younger age group (\u22645 years) have more cutaneous vitamin D synthesis than those in the older age groups (Godar, 2001).\n\n",

Levels of vitamin D fortification range from 1 \u03bcg (40 IU) per regulatory serving for ready-to-eat cereals to 2.5 \u03bcg for fluid milk servings (Calvo and Whiting, 2013). It is evident from reviewing the vitamin D content of the \u2018baby foods\u2019 listed in the recent USDA database, Standard Release-24 for nutrient composition of foods that there is a need for newer fortified baby foods. A review of 223 foods showed vitamin D contents ranged from 0 to 0.8 \u03bcg vitamin D per 100 g, and approximately 90 % had no listed vitamin D content. With the availability of limited fortified baby foods, in a population study of 750 healthy children aged 6\u201336 months, the mean overall vitamin D intake from food plus supplements was 290 \u00b1 124 IU/d in 6\u201312 month age group and 240 \u00b1 128 IU/d in 1\u20133 years age group (Figure 16.4), and group corresponding serum 25(OH)D levels decreased with age. A quite concerning trend in this cohort was that children discontinued breastfeeding by 5 months of age and most children (84 %) were no longer formula-fed at 5 months (Carpenter et al., 2012). Thus, with the IOM recommended adequate intake of 400 IU/d for infants and 600 IU/d for toddlers approximately 82 % of infants and 2 % of toddlers met the age-specific dietary intake recommendation. These findings suggest that vitamin D-fortified infant formulas provide a positive effect on vitamin D levels and similar supplementary practices are likely to be effective in increasing 25(OH)D status in young children (Carpenter et al., 2012). The mean intake data for toddlers (2\u20135 years age) from the NHANES 2007\u20132008 cohort shows a significant difference in vitamin D intake among the racial and ethnic groups with Non-Hispanic blacks consuming less than Non-Hispanic whites, who consume less than Mexican Americans (Figure 16.5) (USDA, 2010). Correspondingly, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children (1\u20135 years) during the 2001\u20132004 NHANES was highest among Non-Hispanic blacks followed by Mexican Americans and Non-Hispanic whites (Figure 16.6) (Kumar et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Lung development occurs predominantly before birth (Stick, 2000) with extensive interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissue beginning by the fourth week of gestation and continuing for years after birth, and factors that impair fetal and early childhood lung development have the potential to exert major effects on lung function during childhood and adulthood. Despite differences in the epithelial growth and differentiation during lung development in rodents and humans, rodent models are widely used for lung developmental studies. Rodent models act as a bridge between studies in the laboratory and studies in humans, and have been used to study pulmonary infections (Balan et al., 2011). In rodents, it has been demonstrated that vitamin D modulates key alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, such as type II pneumocyte and lipofibroblast proliferation and differentiation which are critical for alveolar development and septal thinning during perinatal pulmonary maturation (Sakurai et al., 2009). Vitamin D-deficient rodent models provide mechanistic evidence for a causal link between vitamin D deficiency and deficits in lung function and altered lung structure. Specifically, offspring of vitamin D-deficient mice showed no effect on the overall somatic growth, had marginal reduced numbers of alveoli, and exhibited physiologically significant decreases in lung volume and altered lung mechanics when compared with offspring of vitamin D-replete mice (Zosky et al., 2011). This mouse study complements data showing decreased lung compliance in 50-d-old rats born to vitamin D-deficient mothers (Gaultier et al., 1984), confirming the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and lung function. In addition, as vitamin D deficiency has the potential for premature births in humans (Dawodu and Nath, 2011), studies have shown that prematurity leads to diminished lung function and may predispose premature infants to severe viral lower respiratory tract infections in infancy (Drysdale et al., 2011).",

Surfactant proteins were initially identified as a lipoprotein complex that reduced surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the lung, but recent studies have identified surfactant proteins as components of the lung innate and adaptive immune system with novel roles in the direct killing of inhaled microorganisms and viruses, and control of pulmonary inflammation (Wright, 2005). The vitamin D-mediated rodent type II pneumocyte maturation data looks intriguing but the relevance to humans is uncertain. Regulation of surfactant protein gene expression in human fetal type II pneumocytes by active vitamin D is not coordinated as it is in rodents, but vitamin D receptor immuno-staining is observed in human fetal fibroblasts and type II pneumocytes (Phokela et al., 2005; Stio et al., 1997).",

Innate immunity includes the production of antimicrobial peptides such as Beta-defensins and CAMP by epithelial cells and circulating leukocytes, which are capable of killing a variety of respiratory pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi (Hiemstra, 2007). In early gestation, human decidual cells have been shown to synthesize active vitamin D, which may exert autocrine or paracrine effects on the developing fetal immune system. Vitamin D mediates expression of mRNA for CAMP in decidual cells (Evans et al., 2006), and has been linked to intrauterine immunity (Singh et al., 2005). Human monocytes in an in vitro model, when supplemented with 25(OH)D-deficient cord blood plasma showed a significant decrease in CAMP expression, thus correlating with increased susceptibility to newborn infections (Walker et al., 2011).",

The respiratory epithelial cells constitutively activate vitamin D, and are capable of creating a microenvironment that has high levels of active form of the vitamin, resulting in the activation of downstream genes such as those for CAMP. Moreover, viral RNA increases the expression of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase, leading to increased activation of vitamin D and further increases in CAMP mRNA (Hansdottir et al., 2008). Hansdottir and colleagues (2010) have shown in an in vitro human tracheo-bronchial epithelial cell model for respiratory syncytial virus infection, that vitamin D attenuates inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response, while maintaining the antiviral activity. This local vitamin D-mediated anti-viral, anti-inflammatory immune response could result in decreased disease severity and morbidity from this common infection (Hansdottir et al., 2010). Thus, vitamin insufficiency and notably, a seasonal decrease of vitamin D-dependent epithelial and leukocyte innate host defense could contribute to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections during winter. A prospective descriptive study of outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency and pneumonia reported 25(OH)D deficiency associated with increased mortality but not associated with levels of cathelicidin or Beta-defensin (Leow et al., 2011). Clinical trials are underway to assess CAMP expression as a biomarker for fetal-neonatal immune function following antenatal vitamin D supplementation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01126528) and in a separate trial for Intensive Care Unit-associated lung failure, CAMP and Beta-defensin concentrations will be evaluated as a secondary outcome following high-dose vitamin D regimen (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01372995).",

Likewise, cord-blood 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with risk of wheezing by 15 months, 3 years, and 5 years of age (all P < 0.05) and no association to incident asthma by the age of 5 years. Additional adjustment for potential confounders including seasons of birth did not materially change these results (Camargo et al., 2011b). A recent birth cohort study of 156 healthy neonates showed an association of vitamin D deficiency with increased risk of RSV LRTIs in the first year of life. Neonates born with 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/l had a sixfold (95 % CI = 1.6-24.9; P = 0.01) increased risk of RSV LRTI in the first year of life compared with those with 25(OH)D concentrations \u226575 nmol/l (Belderbos et al., 2011). Similarly, in a population based mother-child cohort study there was a trend of independent association between higher levels of maternal circulating 25(OH)D in pregnancy and decreased odds of LRTIs in offspring (for cohort- and season-specific quartile Q4 vs. Q1, OR: 0.67 (95 % CI = 0.50-0.90); test for trend, P = 0.016). No association was found between 25(OH)D levels in pregnancy and risk of wheezing at age 1 year or 4 years, or asthma at age 4\u20136 years (Morales et al., 2012).",

Administration of oral vitamin D, 60,000 IU/wk and 650 mg of calcium/d for 6 weeks decreased the incidence of respiratory infections in the test population (Rehman, 1994). Similarly in a case\u2013control study, 13-fold higher incidence of nutritional rickets was observed among toddlers (<5 years) with pneumonia than among controls (OR = 13.37; P < 0.001) (Muhe et al., 1997). More recently, significant associations have been identified with non-rachitic vitamin D levels and respiratory tract infections suggesting that vitamin D insufficiency is enough to trigger respiratory infection rather than a secondary manifestation of acute deficiency typically leading to nutritional rickets.",

Furthermore, in a neonatal case\u2013control study of ALRIs in Turkey, mean serum level of 25(OH)D was 22.7 \u00b1 22.2 nmol/l compared to age-matched control levels, 40.6 \u00b1 33.6 nmol/l (P = 0.011) and corresponding 25(OH)D levels in mothers of the study group were lower than those in the mothers of the control group (33.4 \u00b1 42 nmol/l and 57 \u00b1 42.3 nmol/l respectively; P = 0.012). These findings suggest that newborns with subclinical vitamin D deficiency may have an increased risk of suffering from acute lower respiratory infection and the strong positive correlation between newborns and mothers 25(OH)D concentrations shows that adequate vitamin D supplementation of mothers should be emphasized during pregnancy (Karatekin et al., 2009).",

Worldwide recognition of this problem is growing and this awareness is stimulating changes in dietary guidelines (Table 16.1), as well as advice on safe sun exposure (Godar et al., 2012) and strategies for national fortification policies (Babu and Calvo, 2010). Viral and bacterial pneumonia kills more children than any other illness, accounting for 19 per cent of all under five deaths worldwide (UNICEF, 2006). According to the 2006 UNICEF/WHO report, an estimated 26 % of neonatal deaths are caused by severe infections during the neonatal period, the majority of which are caused by pneumonia/sepsis. Undernutriton, which includes vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, has been implicated in 53 % of all deaths among children under five (UNICEF, 2006). If vitamin D intervention currently under study in the clinical trials described in this chapter is proven successful, then implementation of new fortification practices, revised guidelines for healthy sun exposure and public health programs for vitamin D supplementation of pregnant/lactating women and their infants may be effective strategies to aid in preventing neonates and children under five from developing respiratory infections. Globally, there is potential to save more than a million young lives with preventive treatment, a compelling reason why the efficacy of optimizing vitamin D-mediated defense against respiratory pathogens in infants and children merits further study.",
