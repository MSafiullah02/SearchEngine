Observational studies and case-reports were selected and analyzed. West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) disease and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were included in the review for their potential zoonotic transmission. The most important risk factor for acquiring WNV infection and CCHF infection is the exposure to infected mosquitoes and ticks, respectively; therefore, outdoor workers are at risk of infection. HEV is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, that can become infected through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes. A total of 10, 34 and 45 eligible studies for WNV, CCHF virus (CCFHV) and HEV, respectively, were analyzed by year, country, study design, risk group and outcomes.

Climate change (warmer temperature and higher cumulative rainfall) could be one of the drivers that contribute to the changing pattern of transmission of several vector-borne diseases (Riccardo et al. 2018) . Following transmission via mosquito bites, WNV replicates in keratinocytes and in the skin dendritic cells (DCs), Langherans cells (LCs), which then migrates to the local lymphnodes from where the virus disseminate to the kidney, spleen and other visceral organs. In about 1% of all infected patients, the WNV infection evolves to severe neurologic disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis and death. The virus entry to the central nervous system can be either via blood stream as well as via trans-neural pathways. Infection can also happen by blood transfusion, organ, tissue and cell transplants.

Type I IFN receptors signaling in astrocytes regulates the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and protects the cerebellum from neuroinvasive infection by WNV. Therefore, the negative regulation of IFN responses, by either host and viral factors, can contribute to the pathogenesis of WNV.

With regard to the role of the adaptive immunity responses to CCHFV in human pathogenesis, it is not completely clear, due to the lack of suitable model in vivo. The evidence obtained from the recently developed cynomologus animal model suggested that neither the antibodies titer nor their neutralizing activity seem to correlate to the outcome of CCHFV infection.

There was significantly good measure for inter-reviewer agreement (Cohen's k = 0.825, P < 0.001). Summary data from selected studies are reported in Table 3 . The majority were epidemiological (24) and cross-sectional (15) studies from Africa (Uganda, Nigeria, Madagascar, Ghana and Burkina Faso), Asia (India, China, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand), Europe (Italy, Germany, Portugal, Norway, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Netherlands), Brazil and Cuba. Three were retrospective studies (from Switzerland, Italy and Spain), two case studies (Australia and Spain) and one casecontrol study (China). In occupational settings zoonotic transmission of HEV implies direct contact with swine, principal reservoir of HEV or other animals (wild boar, deer). Indirect contact in areas where animals live and roam or with objects or surfaces contaminated with HEV stools is also considered a transmission route, as well as contact with pig and slaughterhouse sewage. Articles selected in the review comprised mainly swine workers, including farmers and slaughterers, and veterinarians as occupational categories at risk of exposure to HEV; to a lesser extent food handlers (Appuhamy et al. 2014; Cui et al. 2016 ), workers exposed to wastewater (Tschopp et al. 2009; Albatanony and El-Shafie 2011; Martins et al. 2014 ) and forestry workers (Carpentier et al. 2012; Dremsek et al. 2012) .

Nosocomial transmission may therefore occur through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids, or through contaminated medical equipment or supply (ECDC 2015) . Case reports attesting CCHFV transmission through direct contact with infected blood or tissue of animals regarded mainly farmers (Yadav et al. 2017 ) and livestock workers (Mardani et al. 2009; Mardani, Namazee 2013) . Traditional slaughtering and butchery performed in some country (Iran) can be considered activities at risk (Fazlalipour et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 665, "end": 689, "text": "(Al-Abri SS et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 690, "end": 709, "text": "Gargili et al 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1330, "text": "(ECDC 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1481, "text": "(Yadav et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1527, "text": "(Mardani et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1550, "text": "Mardani, Namazee 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1686, "text": "(Fazlalipour et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CCHFV"}, {"text": "Most articles sharing this transmission pathway are seroprevalence studies, carried out in Africa, Asia and Europe, and mainly regarding farmers, slaughterers, butchers and veterinarians (Gunes et al. 2009; Sidira et al. 2013; Akuffo et al. 2016; Cikman et al. 2016; Wasfi et al. 2016; Mostafavi et al. 2017; Vawda et al. 2018) . The low seroprevalence for anti-CCHFV IgG antibodies (0.51%) found in South Africa among workers exposed to or in contact with animals seems to suggest that the virus is uncommon in this area (Vawda et al. 2018) . The higher seroprevalence detected in Iran (16.49% among butchers and slaughterhouse workers) could be caused by the minimal use of personal PPE during daily work, as admitted by workers who completed a questionnaire (Mostafavi et al. 2017) . A statistically significant difference between prevalence of CCHFV IgG antibodies in livestock workers and unexposed subjects was found in Turkey. CCHFV is endemic in central and north-eastern Anatolia and southern Black Sea regions of this country and several cases are emerging in other zones (Cikman et al. 2016) . A cross sectional study conducted in Greece showed that an agro-pastoral occupation, contact with sheep and goats, tick bites and increasing age were significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity. Another cross sectional study performed in Madagascar (Andriamandimby et al. 2011) showed that here the percentage of CCHF infection is very low among at risk professionals because of the lack of ticks of the genera Hyalomma in this country. Four retrospective studies were conducted in India (Mourya et al. 2017) and Turkey (Duran et al. 2013; Guner et al. 2014; Leblebicioglu et al. 2016 ) on patients with a history of occupational exposure, suspected to have CCHFV infection, through a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data. In endemic areas, hemorrhagic manifestations including melena, low platelet count and raised alanine aminotransferase may provide a suspicion of CCHFV infection. In Turkey, people living and actively working in rural areas (including housewives occupied in agriculture and animal husbandry) are particularly subjected to the infection. It was observed that public awareness about CCHFV has decreased the incidence of the disease (Duran et al. 2013) . Nosocomial transmission of CCHFV to HCWs has been reported from different countries. The evidence that HCWs are at risk of exposure to CCHFV while caring infected patients is also supported by most case reports selected for the review (Mardani et al. 2009; Naderi et al. 2011; Celikbas et al. 2014; Ozsoy et al. 2015; Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015; Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016; Negredo et al. 2017 ). In the differential diagnosis of subjects with hemorrhagic signs, physicians should consider CCHFV infection if these patients have recently returned from any area where the virus is endemic or prevalent. Of interest the concern regarding transmission of CCHFV via respiratory contact, as supposed by a case report from Russia (Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015) and one from Turkey (Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016) , suggesting that airborne precautions could be essential during aerosol generating procedures. High mortality rate has been attested during nosocomial outbreaks; in some cases, ribavirin has been considered an effective treatment for the infection and could be used for postexposure prophylaxis (Celikbas et al. 2014) . In our review, we included seroprevalence studies regarding seropositive HCWs from Turkey (Gozel et al. 2013) , Greece (Maltezou, Maltezos and Papa 2009) and Iran (Mardani et al. 2007 ). Needle-stick injury, interventions for gastrointestinal bleeding, unprotected handling of infected materials, and emergency surgical interventions have been reported as high-risk activities for viral transmission. Military personnel that travel to and work in environments where they could be exposed to endemic or emerging infections, that are not present or prevalent in their native country, can be considered at high risk of contracting CCHFV. We selected 3 articles regarding Afghan National Army recruits (Todd et al. 2016 ) UK military personnel deployed to Afghanistan (Newman et al. 2014) , and military units from Saudi Arabian Provinces. In these groups, seroprevalences were 4.1%, 0% and 0.58%, respectively. CCHFV infection has important public health implication due to the potential of humanto-human transmission; therefore, enhanced surveillance for tick vectors and CCHFV cases is essential. Control and prevention of the infection in ticks and animal is quite difficult since the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in animals is usually not apparent. Educational and training programs addressed to workers with potential exposure to the virus aiming at increasing their knowledge, attitude and practice should be developed and implemented as preventive measures. Moreover, the use of approved acaricides on clothing and tick repellent on exposed skin and clothing, and wearing protective clothing are suggested for reducing the risk of tick to human transmission. Wearing gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in areas where CCHFV is endemic could minimize the risk of animal to human transmission (WHO 2013; ECDC 2015) . In healthcare settings, implementation of standard infection control precautions by healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHFV infection or handling their specimens, should be recommended.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 206, "text": "(Gunes et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 207, "end": 226, "text": "Sidira et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 227, "end": 246, "text": "Akuffo et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 247, "end": 266, "text": "Cikman et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 267, "end": 285, "text": "Wasfi et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 286, "end": 308, "text": "Mostafavi et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 309, "end": 327, "text": "Vawda et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 522, "end": 541, "text": "(Vawda et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 761, "end": 784, "text": "(Mostafavi et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1102, "text": "(Cikman et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1389, "text": "(Andriamandimby et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1620, "text": "(Mourya et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1651, "text": "(Duran et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1670, "text": "Guner et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1696, "text": "Leblebicioglu et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2301, "text": "(Duran et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2560, "text": "(Mardani et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2580, "text": "Naderi et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2602, "text": "Celikbas et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2621, "text": "Ozsoy et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2655, "text": "Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2688, "text": "Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2689, "end": 2708, "text": "Negredo et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 3039, "end": 3073, "text": "(Pshenichnaya and Nenadskaya 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3127, "text": "(Yildirmak, Tulek and Bulut 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3446, "text": "(Celikbas et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3539, "end": 3558, "text": "(Gozel et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3568, "end": 3602, "text": "(Maltezou, Maltezos and Papa 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3612, "end": 3632, "text": "(Mardani et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 4147, "end": 4164, "text": "(Todd et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 4213, "end": 4233, "text": "(Newman et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 5320, "end": 5330, "text": "(WHO 2013;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5331, "end": 5341, "text": "ECDC 2015)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CCHFV"}, {"text": "HEV is a major cause of epidemic viral hepatitis in developing countries and of sporadic and cluster cases in industrialized countries.
