Nowadays, different expression systems are used for the production of recombinant proteins including bacteria, yeasts, molds, mammals, plants, and insects. Yeast expression systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) are more popular. P. pastoris expression system is one of the most popular and standard tools for the production of recombinant protein in molecular biology. Overall, the benefits of protein production by P. pastoris system include appropriate folding (in the endoplasmic reticulum) and secretion (by Kex2 as signal peptidase) of recombinant proteins to the external environment of the cell. Moreover, in the P. pastoris expression system due to its limited production of endogenous secretory proteins, the purification of recombinant protein is easy. It is also considered a unique host for the expression of subunit vaccines which could significantly affect the growing market of medical biotechnology. Although P. pastoris expression systems are impressive and easy to use with well-defined process protocols, some degree of process optimization is required to achieve maximum production of the target proteins. Methanol and sorbitol concentration, Mut forms, temperature and incubation time have to be adjusted to obtain optimal conditions, which might vary among different strains and externally expressed protein. Eventually, optimal conditions for the production of a recombinant protein in P. pastoris expression system differ according to the target protein.",

Yeasts are other eukaryotic cells that are widely used for the expression of several proteins in vaccine and pharmaceutical production. The mechanism of protein expression in these microorganisms is close to the ones in mammalian cells. Compared with bacteria, yeast cells have significant advantages including growth speed, posttranslational modification, secretory expression, and easy genetic manipulation. Furthermore, linearized foreign DNA can be inserted in a chromosome in high efficiency via cross recombination phenomena to generate stable cell lines (Daly & Hearn, 2005) . Among yeast cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in the manufacture of hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines, both of which produce a protective immune response against wild-type viruses (Bill, 2015) .

Yamada et al. then categorized the organism to a novel genus, Komagataella or Pichia (Naumov, Naumova, & Boundy-Mills, 2018) . It has been proven that P. pastoris, as an engineered methylotrophic microorganism, can use methanol as sole carbon and energy source (Cereghino, Cereghino, Ilgen & Cregg, 2002) . Unlike, Y-11430 strain (wild-type), which is not used for protein expression, GS115 is one of the most popular strains used as an important expression system particularly in industry and medicine fields (Julien, 2006) . P. pastoris GS115 strain has two encoding genes (AOX1 and AOX2) of alcohol oxidase (AOX) enzyme. In the presence of methanol, the transcription of these genes is induced and finally produces a high amount of AOX enzyme (Vanz et al., 2012) . Although both genes are used for the production of an AOX enzyme, AOX1 produces more enzyme. Therefore, by knocking out the AOX1 gene, the growth on methanol is slowed down drastically. This phenotype is called methanol utilization slow (Mut S ).",

Based on EasySelect\u2122 Pichia Expression Kit (Catalog no. K1750-01, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), at least 0.5% concentration of methanol is required for the expression of recombinant proteins. The production could reach to the maximum level of 2-2.5% (wt/vol) of methanol (Z. Wang et al., 2010) . Normally, the concentration of methanol up to 5% is tolerable for the organisms, but high levels of methanol concentrations (above 5%) are very toxic for cell viability and can stop the production process (Santoso, Herawati, & Rubiana, 2012) . Another limitation in the Pichia system is the presence of a few selectable markers for P. pastoris transformation. Selectable marker genes include his4, arg4, and Shble (needed to resist against Zeocin antibiotic) (Cereghino & Cregg, 1999) . A common occurrence in this system is the contamination of expressive broth culture with saprophytic bacteria and fungi. The secreted proteases of these microorganisms potentially hydrolyze the secreted proteins to the supernatant (Stewart, 2015) . Indeed, one of the problems in the P. pastoris expression system is the destruction of proteins produced by proteases. New P. pastoris strains such as SMD1163 (his4 pep4 prb1), SMD1165 (his4 pep4), SMD1168 (his4 pep4), BG21, and Pichia pink have no protease; therefore, the degradation of a secreted protein is prevented. In these strains, to achieve high product yields and the quality of recombinant proteins, the genes encoding of proteinase A (pep4) and proteinase B (prb1) have been disrupted (Safder, Khan, Islam, & Kazim, 2018) .",

Sorbitol does not induce or repress AOX promoters, hence using sorbitol instead of glycerol in mixed substrate methods could reduce cell growth rate, and increase specific product formation rates. The use of mixed substrates increases productivity and cell density and reduces induction time (Orman, Calik, & Ozdamar, 2009 ). Moreover, cofeeding of sorbitol with methanol reduces the toxic effects of intermediate metabolites and oxygen consumption. However, sorbitol has a negative impact on the specific activity of the AOX1 promoter (\u00c7elik, \u00c7al\u0131k, & Oliver, 2009) . Several studies revealed that methanol/sorbitol cofeeding increases the expression of the recombinant proteins (Gao et al., 2012; Z. Wang et al., 2010; T. Zhu et al., 2011) . The results obtained by Azadi, Mahboubi, Naghdi, Solaimanian, and Mortazavi (2017) showed that sorbitol at a concentration of 50 g/L (5%) could significantly increase the expression of recombinant protein. Moreover, according to the results of other studies, 2.5% methanol with 1% sorbitol , 2% methanol with 0.5% sorbitol , and 2% methanol with 1% sorbitol (Soleimanpour et al., 2015) were considered optimal for the highest recombinant protein production in shake flask culture. Therefore, the presence of other carbon sources such as glycerol and sorbitol can be beneficial to increase protein production. Since the AOX1 promoter is repressed severely by glycerol, sorbitol is considered an appropriate replacement (M. Gao & Shi, 2013) .",

Several studies revealed that by lowering the cultivation temperature from 30\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C, protein production can be improved according to higher yeast cell viability, decreased folding stress and lower proteolytic activity against the target protein (Dragosits et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2015; Gasser et al., 2007; Li et al., 2001; Zhong et al., 2014) . The decreased synthetic rate of target protein in low-temperature cultivation causes ER stress reduction, preserves the folding capacity of the ER and enhances cell viability (Zhong et al., 2014) .",

In the P. pastoris expression system, production time is relatively long (about 100 hr). The incubation time is related to the number of yeast cells and the degree of target protein degradation. Santoso et al. (2012) showed that the highest growth of P. pastoris cells was at 96 hr incubation time, whereas the highest protein expression occurred at 48 hr. This suggests that it is very possible that longer incubation time may cause more proteolytic digestion of the expressed protein. Moreover, other studies discussed that optimal protein expression occurred at 72 to 96 hr incubation time Soleimanpour et al., 2015) .",

In yeast, the structure of N-linked glycans is typical of the hypermannose type, whereas, in humans, complex and hybrid structures are of the predominant type. For providing N-linked glycosylation, oligosaccharides are attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine (Asn) residue through an N-glycosyl linkage within the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid except proline). For yielding the O-linked type of glycosylation, oligosaccharides are attached to serine or threonine residues through a glycosidic linkage. The O-linked saccharides are typically much 1b). In comparison to S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris may have an advantage in the glycosylation of secreted proteins because it may not hyperglycosylated. In P. pastoris N-glycans (Man8-14GlcNAc2) are frequently shorter than the long oligosaccharide chains (Man > 50GlcNAc2) found in the S. cerevisiae. Besides, S. cerevisiae core oligosaccharides have terminal \u03b1-1,3 glycan linkages whereas P. pastoris does not. Unlike S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris does not hyperglycosylated therapeutic proteins and does not contain potentially immunogenic terminal \u03b1-1,3-linked mannoses(Figure 1c). It is believed that the \u03b1-1,3 glycan linkages in glycosylated proteins produced from S. cerevisiae are primarily responsible for the hyperantigenic nature of these proteins making them particularly unsuitable for therapeutic use. Moreover, very little O-linked glycosylation has",

Recently, new strategies have been designed to engineer the P. pastoris N-glycosylation pathway. With Pichia GlycoSwitch, the yeast's own hyperglycosyl N-glycans are switched to the more human biantennary complex-type N-glycans. In glycoengineering strategy by disruption of an endogenous glycosyltransferase gene (OCH1) and introducing heterologous enzyme activities, Pichia has been engineered to produce human-like glycoproteins(Jacobs, Geysens, Vervecken, Contreras, & Callewaert, 2009). Indeed, the first step of humanizing Pichia glycosylation or GlycoSwitch \u00ae strategy is the knockout of the gene coding for \u03b1-1,6-mannosyltransferase (OCH1) which is responsible for the initiation of hypermannosylation. The next step in this process is the co-overexpression of several glycosyltransferases or glycosidase to produce human-like glycoproteins. Commonly employed Pichia GlycoSwitch \u00ae strains (BioGrammatics, Carlsbad, CA) are SuperMan5, SuperMan5HIS \u2212 , SuperMan5pep4 -, SuperMan5(aox1 -, Muts), Super-Man5(pep4 -, prb1 -) and SuperMan5(pep4 -, sub2 -). These strains, OCH1 inactivated strains that express an ER-targeted \u03b1-1,2mannosidase, express target protein with a mannose-5 structure at N-linked site(Ahmad et al., 2014; Figure 1d). The SuperMan5 strain is commonly used to express of vaccine antigens. Moreover, by introducing heterologous enzyme activities and adding of N-acetyl glucose amine (GN) or Gal, the SuperMan5 strain has been engineered to produce human-like glycoproteins (M 5 GN and M 5 GNGal strains).M 5 GN and M 5 GNGal strains (BioGrammatics) are commonly used to express vaccine antigens, cytokines, and antibodies.

            "text": "expression of any recombinant gene in P. pastoris has three phase: (a) Cloning of a new gene into a suitable expression vector, Invitrogen), to increase the efficacy of external DNA integration into the Pichia genome, first, the cloned vector should be linear with restriction enzymes such as Sac I, PmeI, and BstX I. Then, linear DNA should be inserted into the competent cells by electroporation. The entered gene is integrated into the cell genome via the crossover recombination phenomenon (Figure 2), and consequently, recombinant cells are formed. In most cases, a single crossover occurs in the genome, but multiple insertions occur in 1-10% of the cases (Kit). The expression vectors in the P. pastoris expression system are one of the major components of this system. These vectors are composed of three sequences: Promoter sequence (most often AOX1) in 5\u2032 region; transcriptional termination sequence in 3\u2032 region which is essential in the processing and polyadenylation of messenger RNAs; and one sequence that contains single or multiple cloning sites, necessary for the insertion of the gene of interest. The episomal vectors can replicate either autonomously in the cytoplasm or as part of a chromosome. But the vectors used in P. pastoris have no stable episomal status; therefore, theyshould first be linearized with enzymes and then be integrated into the P. pastoris chromosome. Like E. coli, expression vectors in P. pastoris are shuttle vectors that is they can propagate in two different host species. The vectors also contain one drug resistance genes such as Kan, Shble, Bsd, Amp, or FLD1, which are resistant to geneticin, zeocin, blasticidin, ampicillin, and formaldehyde, respectively(Ilgen, Lin-Cereghino, & Cregg, 2005). Common plasmids used in the P. pastoris expression system to produce extracellular and intracellular proteins are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.F I G U R E 2 Crossover recombination phenomenon in the Pichia pastoris genome. Following the electroporation process of competent yeast cells, cloned linear vectors are inserted into the electroporated cells. Crossover recombination occurs between 5\u2032 promoter (5\u2032 P AOX1 ) of vector and AOX1 region of P. pastoris genome. Consequently, cloned cells with a recombinant genome are formed. AOX1, Subunit vaccines expressed in Pichia pastoris Recombinant protein therapeutics is a growing market within the human medical biotechnology industry. The majority of all approved biopharmaceuticals are protein-based and include blood factors, anticoagulants, hormones, hematopoietic growth factors, interferons, interleukins, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Vaccine production is one of the major protective strategies against infectious diseases. In general, vaccines used for all pathogens are divided into three groups: live attenuated, inactivated/killed, and subunit vaccines(Schiller & Lowy, 2014). After the injection of live attenuated vaccines, microorganisms start to replicate in the injection area and could induce strong immune responses. However, reversion of attenuated pathogen to its wild-type strain especially in immunocompromised individuals has restricted the application of these vaccines(Minor, 2015). Although, inactivated/killed vaccines are safe, they are relatively less effective in the induction of strong immune responses. Therefore, these vaccines should be injected in multiple doses along with suitable adjuvants (S.Lee & Nguyen, 2015). Subunit vaccines consist of one or more immunodominant antigens of pathogens that can be produced in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Unlike live attenuated and killed/inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines are completely safe and cost-effective. Recently, subunit vaccines have been replaced with other forms of vaccines.",
