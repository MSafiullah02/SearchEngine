Tachypnea is thought to be the best clinical predictor of lower respiratory tract infection in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines pneumonia primarily as cough or difficult breathing and tachypnea. The definition of tachypnea is related to age, with a respiratory rate of >60 breaths/ min in infants aged 0 to 2 months, >50 in infants 2 to 12 months, >40 in children 1 to 5 years, and >20 in children older than 5 years of age. 63, 64 Tachypnea has a sensitivity of 50% to 85% for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection and a specificity of 70% to 97%. 65, 66 At less than 24 months of age, the younger the patient, the less likely that pneumonia is the diagnosis if tachypnea is absent. In one study, for infants younger than 2 months of age, a respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min, retractions, or nasal flaring had sensitivity for the diagnosis of pneumonia of 91%. 66 In a study from a U.S. emergency department of children younger than 5 years who were undergoing chest radiography for possible pneumonia, respiratory rates in those with or without documented pneumonia did not differ significantly. However, 20% of those with WHO-defined tachypnea had pneumonia confirmed compared with 12% of those who did not. 67 Obtaining chest radiographs for febrile infants without an apparent focus of infection to exclude pneumonia missed by physical examination has a low yield in the absence of tachypnea. 68, 69 Cough is a more sensitive but nonspecific symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms and signs associated with pneumonia, such as nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis, have lower sensitivity (25%, 9%, and 9%, respectively) but high specificity (87%, 93%, and 94%, respectively). 65 Although fever, cough, and tachypnea are cardinal features, they can be overshadowed or overlooked in patients who come to medical attention for pneumoniaassociated stiff neck, abdominal pain, or chest pain or for nonspecific symptoms of illness, such as feeding difficulty in infants. Although a chest radiograph is not routinely needed for children with any of these complaints, it should be considered if the patient has fever and cough or tachypnea. 70, 71 Classic symptoms of pneumonia reported in adolescents and adults are fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and cough that produces purulent sputum, with less noticeable tachypnea.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1118, "end": 1120, "text": "62", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1648, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1782, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1785, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2095, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2444, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2632, "text": "68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2633, "end": 2635, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2925, "end": 2927, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 3382, "end": 3385, "text": "70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 3386, "end": 3388, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1129, "text": "Table 21", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "TACHYPNEA AND OTHER SIGNS OF LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT DISORDERS"}, {"text": "Grunting is an expiratory sound produced in the larynx when vocal cords are adducted to generate positive end-expiratory pressure (i.e., self-induced PEEP) and increased resting volume of the lung.
