This development has also seen a tremendous output of published literature on the topic of HPLC of peptides, perhaps making the decision as to how best to approach a particular separation problem seem formidable to the novice, or even experienced HPLC user. Fortunately, regardless of whether high-performance approaches are utilized for routine peptide separations or for such state-of-the-art areas as proteomics, capillary methods, biospecific interactions, and so on, the fundamentals of chromatographic protocols remain the same. Thus, it is not the purpose of this chapter to present a comprehensive review of HPLC of peptides. Indeed, there is a wealth of relevant material accessible in the literature. For instance, several useful articles and reviews on HPLC of peptides can be found in refs.\n1\u20134. In addition, refs.\n5\n\u2013\n8 represent excellent resource books in this area. Finally, ref.\n9 offers an extensive source of information on the early development of HPLC of peptides.",

            "text": "The side-chains of amino acids are generally classified according to their polarity, i.e., nonpolar or hydrophobic vs polar or hydrophilic. Further, the polar side-chains are divided into three main groups: uncharged polar, positively charged, or basic side-chains, and negatively charged or acidic side-chains. Within any single group, there are considerable variations in the size, shape and properties of the side-chains. Peptides containing ionizable (acidic and basic) side-chains have a characteristic isoelectric point (pI) and the overall net charge and polarity of a peptide in aqueous solution will vary with pH. Thus, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, as well as the number of charged groups present, become important factors in the separation of peptides. Intrinsic amino acid side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity coefficients have been recently published (10), and these reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC derived values at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0 are shown in Table\n1. \u201cIntrinsic\u201d implies the maximum possible hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of side-chains in the absence of nearest-neighbor or conformational effects that would decrease the full expression of the side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity when the side-chain is in a polypeptide chain. Such a scale is the fundamental starting point for determining the parameters that affect side-chain hydrophobicity for quantifying such effects in peptides and proteins (e.g., the quantitative evaluation of the contribution of a specific amino side-chain to ligand\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein interactions and to protein folding and stability) and in aiding the development of protocols for optimum separation of polypeptides. The RP-HPLC-based approach to determining these intrinsic coefficients is described under Subheading\n3.3.1\n\n",

As shown in Table\n2, Ala has the highest side-chain \u03b1-helical propensity and Gly the lowest. A value for Pro could not be determined because the side-chain of this amino acid completely disrupts \u03b1-helical structure, even in the presence of helix inducing solvents such as trifluoroethanol (TFE). Such intrinsic propensity values provide a powerful tool for protein design as well as providing a guide to predicting the potential conformational status of a peptide during chromatography. The latter is particularly true of RP-HPLC because the nonpolar environment characteristic of this HPLC mode make it a strong inducer of \u03b1-helical structure in potentially \u03b1-helical amino acid sequences (12\n\u201315).\n\n\n",

Thus, knowledge of the contribution of individual amino acid side-chains in the hydrophobic core of a folded protein to peptide/protein conformation and stability is also of importance when considering the effect of the peptide/protein solubility, conformation, and interactions with the HPLC matrix during chromatography. Table\n3 lists stability coefficients of amino acids generated from single amino acid substitutions in the \u201ca\u201d or \u201cd\u201d position of the central heptad of model \u03b1-helical coiled coils (heptad positions are denoted \u201cabcdefg,\u201d where positions \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d are the nonpolar positions responsible for the formation and stability of coiled-coils). Such coefficients allow an assessment of the effect of side-chain substitution in the hydrophobic core, as well as provide information on the effect of side-chain hydrophobicity and packing in the hydrophobic core. Although the values shown in Table\n3 were derived from a coiled-coil model (16,17), we had previously shown that the relative contributions of nonpolar residues to protein stability in two-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coils showed an excellent linear correlation with the results obtained in globular proteins. In both protein types, the mutations were made in hydrophobic residues involved in the hydrophobic core, which is responsible for overall protein stability (18). This demonstrates the general applicability of these results to proteins in general.\n\n",

Should a choice need to be made concerning the type of ion-exchange column for general peptide applications, a strong cation-exchange column is recommended. The utility of such a column lies in its ability to retain its negatively charged character in the acidic and neutral pH range, which is due to the strongly acidic sulfonate functionality characteristic of such a packing. Most peptides are soluble at low pH, where the side-chain carboxyl groups of acidic residues (glutamic acid, aspartic acid) and the free C-terminal \u03b1-carboxyl group are protonated (i.e., uncharged), thus emphasizing any basic, positively charged character of the peptides. Ion-exchange columns have proven particularly useful in a multistep protocol for peptide separations, particularly prior to a final RP-HPLC purification and desalting step.",

The majority of researchers have tended to carry out HPLC below pH 3.0 to take advantage of acidic volatile mobile phases (particularly aqueous trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]/acetonitrile [CH\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$_{3}$\\end{document}CN] systems) (1\n\u2013\n8). Such mobile phase volatility is particularly useful when carrying out preparative purification of peptides or when employing RP-HPLC as a final desalting/purification mode in a multistep protocol.

This concept was taken a step further by our laboratory by taking advantage of the inherent hydrophilic character of ion-exchange, specifically strong cation-exchange, columns. Thus, HILIC/CEX combines the most advantageous aspects of two widely different separation mechanisms, i.e., a separation based on hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity differences between peptides overlaid on a separation based on net charge (19\n\u2013\n30). Characteristic of HILIC/CEX separations is the presence of a high organic modifier concentration (generally, acetonitrile) to promote hydrophilic interactions between the solute and the hydrophilic/charged cation-exchange stationary phase. Peptides are then eluted from the column with a salt gradient. Generally, peptides are eluted in groups of peptides in order of increasing net positive charge. Within these groups, peptides are eluted in order of increasing hydrophilicity. Indeed, HILIC/CEX is basically CEX in the presence of high concentrations of acetonitrile (50\u201380%). HILIC/CEX is frequently an excellent complement to RP-HPLC. Indeed, it has rivaled or even exceeded RP-HPLC for specific peptide mixtures (4,20,27,28).",

Figure\n3B shows the elution profiles of a mixture of HRN 916\u2013950 (monomer), HRN 916\u2013950 (T923I, N937I) (dimer), and HRN extended (902\u2013950) (trimer). Figure\n3C represents the log MW vs retention time plot (see\nTable\n4 for values) resulting from observed peptide elution behavior.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\n3, the native HRN 916\u2013950 sequence is eluted as a random coil monomeric peptide during SEC. However, extending the native sequence by two heptads to form HRN extended (902\u2013950) results in a stable, fully folded trimeric coiled-coil (Fig.\n3B).Attachment of the HRN 916\u2013950 sequence to the linker (HRN with linker) also results in a stable, fully folded three-stranded coiled-coil (Fig.\n3A).Replacement of two polar residues, Thr and Asn, by the hydrophobic Ile residues in the native sequence (HRN 916\u2013950) (T923I, N937I) results in a stable, fully folded dimeric coiled-coil (Fig.\n3B). The Ile residues provide the additional stability in the hydrophobic core to stabilize the folded coiled-coil, but as a dimer.Interestingly, although the native HRN 916\u2013950 and HRC 1150\u20131185 sequences are eluted as unfolded, random coil peptides during SEC, a mixture of these two peptides produces a fully folded, \u03b1-helical six-helix bundle (i.e., a hexamer) (Fig.\n3A).Synthetic model amphipathic \u03b1-helical peptide standards designed to monitor the effect of SEC packings and mobile phases on peptide oligomerization have been previously described (35).\n",

In the case of the alkyl amino groups on the side-chains of Orn and Lys, the increase in hydrophilicity (decrease in hydrophobicity) at pH 7.0 relative to pH 2.0 is again due to differences in the effectiveness of these two anions to ion-pair with these side-chains.

The physicochemical properties of the guanidinium group of Arg and the alkyl amino groups of Lys and Orn are quite different. These results clearly demonstrate that Arg and Lys side-chains, although both positively charged at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0, behave differently with buffer anions, which affects their hydrophilicities/hydrophobicities differently. Thus, Arg and Lys residues on the surface of proteins should not be considered equivalent at neutral pH.\n",

Indeed, this separation is superior to that obtained by both RP-HPLC and CE (see\nSubheading\n3.5).\n\nThe peptide separation shown in Fig.\n9 is achieved by a mixed-mode or bidimensional mechanism: the three groups of peptides are separated by an ion-exchange mechanism (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$+1 < +2 < +3$\\end{document}); within these groups of peptides, the peptides are eluted in order of increasing hydrophilicity (decreasing hydrophobicity) by the HILIC mechanism. The high acetonitrile concentration during CEX promotes hydrophilic interactions with the hydrophilic CEX matrix. Thus, within each charged group of peptides, the most hydrophobic peptide is eluted first and the most hydrophilic peptide is eluted last, i.e., the opposite elution order to RP-HPLC.

It is unlikely that this unidimensional approach to the separation of the peptides can be optimized further to achieve complete (or even near complete) resolution of all 27 peptides.\nFigure\n13 shows the separation of the 27 peptides by CE in analogous conditions to that of RP-HPLC (i.e., with aqueous TFA as the background electrolyte [BGE] in the absence or presence of CH\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$_{3}$\\end{document}CN, albeit in the absence of a hydrophobic surface (uncoated capillary).\n\nConditions for CE in Fig.\n13: uncoated capillary (Capillary 1 on Instrument 4); BGE of 10 m\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}${\\it M}$\\end{document} aqueous TFA, adjusted to pH 2.0 with LiOH, with or without 25% (v/v) CH\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$_{3}$\\end{document}CN; applied voltage, 25 kV (direct polarity) with 5-min voltage ramp; temperature, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$15^\\circ{\\rm C}$\\end{document}; UV absorption at 195 nm.As shown in Fig.\n13, both in the absence (top panel) and presence (bottom panel) of 25% CH\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$_{3}$\\end{document}CN, the peptides are separated according to their charge-to-mass ratio (capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) mechanism), each peak representing nine co-migrated peptides.

Fractions are repooled as hydrophilic impurities, pure product and hydrophobic impurities (Fig.\n16A, B, and C, respectively). These three pools are then lyophilized, redissolved in water (10 mL) and reanalyzed by RP-HPLC (5 \u03bcL sample volumes; same conditions as described for Fig.\n15).\nFigure\n16 shows the excellent product purity and yield obtained by this slow gradient approach to purification of the 200-mg sample load (Fig.\n16B). Very little product is found in the hydrophilic fraction (Fig.\n16 A) and hydrophobic fraction (Fig.\n16 C).\n\n\nFigure\n17 illustrates fraction analyses of adjacent fractions at the beginning and end of product appearance for both the 100 mg (top panels) and 200 mg (bottom panels) sample amounts. Note that only one fraction for each sample amount contained overlapping product and hydrophilic impurities (Fr. 63 and Fr. 54 for 100-mg and 200-mg runs, respectively) or overlapping product and hydrophobic impurities (Fr. 75 and Fr. 71 for 100-mg and 200-mg runs, respectively), underlying the effectiveness of this slow gradient approach for resolution of desired peptide product from even closely structurally related synthetic impurities.\n\nIt should be noted that the greater the sample load, the sooner the appearance of desired peptide product eluted from the column, i.e., Fr. 54 for a 200-mg load vs Fr. 63 for a 100-mg load. In addition, the larger the load, the greater the number of fractions needed for product elution (13 fractions for the 100 mg load and 18 fractions for the 200-mg load).The RP-HPLC column has the capacity for an even larger sample load than 200 mg. However, there is not sufficient material available to determine the maximum load on this column.\n",

However, when such a column is subjected to high loading of a peptide mixture dissolved in a 100% aqueous mobile phase, e.g., 0.1% aqueous TFA, there is competition by the sample components for the adsorption sites on the reversed-phase sorbent, resulting in solute\u2013solute displacement during washing with 100% aqueous mobile phase. A more hydrophobic peptide component competes more successfully for these sites than a less hydrophobic component, which is thus displaced ahead of the more hydrophobic solute, i.e., the sample components acts as their own displacers.The SDC approach is thus simply an application of the well established general principles of displacement chromatography without the need for a separate displacer. This mode of operation, a hybrid scheme of frontal chromatography followed by elution, is characterized by a marked reduction in solvent consumption, minimal elution volumes, and the collection of fewer fractions for product isolation than in conventional RP-HPLC, with consequence reductions in time and handling.Several successful SDC separations have been reported (85\n\u2013\n89), including the purification of a therapeutically important synthetic peptide representing part of the sequence of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) (88).SDC has also been adapted to modular solid-phase extraction (SPE) technology for development of a rapid, simple and cost-effective procedure for the efficient and parallel purification of multiple peptide mixtures (91).An interesting application of anion-exchange chromatography in sample displacement mode for protein purification has also been reported (92).\n",
