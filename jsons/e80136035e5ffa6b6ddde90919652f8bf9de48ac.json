            "text": "Animal studies have shown that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is abundantly expressed in the lungs, the heart, as well as in other tissues [1] , is utilized by coronaviruses as a functional receptor for their entrance into the cells [2] [3] [4] . This has generated the hypothesis that drugs commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, renal disease and post-myocardial infarction states such as angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) modify the susceptibility, severity and mortality rate of the current human infections with the Covid-19 because of their well-known association with an overexpression of ACE2, more consistent and marked for ARBs than for ACEIs [5] [6] [7] . This modification has been interpreted as to lead to an increased risk of infection due to a drug-induced increase in the ACE2 substrate, i.e. angiotensin II [8] . It has also been suggested, however, that, on the contrary, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system might have a protective effect [9] because 1) the increased angiotensin II might compete with the virus at the receptor level; and 2) ACE2 converts angiotensin II into inactive compounds [1] and may directly attenuate tissue injury [10] , making its overexpression mechanistically favorable. Unfortunately, published clinical data are largely limited to general demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, with no focused information on the type of antihypertensive treatment they were prescribed at or close to the time of the Covid-19 infection [11, 12] . This means that no evidence is available on whether blockers of the renin-angiotensin system modify the human response to the Covid-19 infection, as well as whether the modification might have an adverse or a protective sign [13] . This represents a serious problem because the possibility that blockers of the renin-angiotensin system may have a relationship with the susceptibility to the Covid-19 infection has had a worldwide large echo in the media, as a result of which many patients have stopped their use [14, 15] . Blockers of the reninangiotensin system are widely used life-saving drugs for cardiovascular and renal disease, and there is strong evidence that treatment withdrawal is associated with a marked increase in related morbidity and mortality risk [16] [17] [18] .",

Patients who required assisted ventilation or died during intensive care will be classified as having a critical/fatal infection, the remaining being regarded as affected from mild clinical manifestations of the infection.
