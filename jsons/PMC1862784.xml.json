This cDNA fragment was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from SARS-CoV Urbani strain genomic RNA, and was a kind gift from Dr. Mark Denison (Vanderbilt University). The cDNA encoding only nsp1, corresponding to bases 265\u2013804 of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain genome (GenBank Accession No. AY278741), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer 5\u2032-ATG GAG AGC CTT GTT CTT GGT G-3\u2032, the reverse primer 5\u2032-TTA ACC TCC ATT GAG CTC ACG AG-3\u2032 and Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). The reverse primer was designed to introduce a STOP codon (TAA) at the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the pcr product. The PCR was conducted in a standard manner, employing 30 cycles and an annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0C with an Applied Biosystems Gene Amp PCR System 2400. The PCR amplified fragment was inserted into a modified pET15b expression vector diagramed in Fig. 1\na (Yanzhou Wang, unpublished results). The stock pET15b vector (Novagen) encodes a N-terminal (His)6 fusion tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site and a multiple cloning site (MCS) encoding several unique restriction enzyme cleavage sites. The modified vector (Topo-HisGST-YZW) replaced the stock fusion tag, thrombin cleavage site and MCS with a N-terminal (His)6-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. This vector was then linearized at the unique XhoI site, and adaptors added to both ends to provide vaccinia topoisomerase recognition sequences.",

This protease retains a useful level of activity over a wide range of buffer conditions and temperature. Thus, it is possible to perform the TEV protease cleavage in conjunction with a dialysis step to remove the imidazole, rather than performing cleavage and dialysis separately. Cleavage was nearly complete following incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The cleaved fusion tag, TEV protease, and any remaining uncleaved fusion protein was separated from the now tagless SARS-CoV nsp1 using a second IMAC column. several of the minor contaminants, presumably E. coli proteins that co-eluted with the fusion protein on the initial IMAC run, were resolved from the cleaved SARS-CoV nsp1 during this step. A single major contaminant running at \u223c65 kDa on SDS\u2013PAGE remained.",

The same Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column and the same SEC buffer was used in both techniques, and the protein eluted as a single well-formed peak in all runs. For the standard SEC size estimation, the purified SARS-CoV nsp1 reproducibly eluted at 14.45 mL, corresponding to a molecular weight estimate of 37.2 kDa (Table 2\n). The calculated molecular weight of the recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV nsp1 is 20.2 kDa, including six vector-derived N-terminal amino acid residues (GSLDAL) remaining post-cleavage. Thus, the molecular weight of 37.2 kDa estimated by SEC implies that the SARS-CoV nsp1 is present as a dimer (37.2/20.2 kDa = 1.84) in solution. The preparative scale SEC column was also calibrated using protein standards, and the molecular weight estimated from the results of this larger SEC column confirmed the analytical SEC results (data not shown). The molecular weight estimated by SEC\u2013MALS was 19.6 kDa. However, the protein eluted from the column at a similar elution volume as in the standard SEC run. These data implies that the SARS-CoV nsp1 are present as a monomer (19.6/20.2 kDa = 0.97) in solution, in contrast to the standard SEC results. The discrepancy in these results will be discussed below.",

It is not unusual for a small number of native E. coli proteins to co-elute with a recombinantly expressed fusion protein containing a single affinity tag purified on the appropriate affinity resin; whereas, it is unusual for a native E. coli protein to effectively bind to both IMAC and glutathione resins. We have successfully used this dual tag/dual affinity column procedure to highly purify a number of proteins, and in at least one instance (mouse HoxA5 homeodomain) the presence of the dual affinity tag dramatically increased expression compared to the comparable fusion protein possessing only a polyhistidine tag (Umland, unpublished data). The Topo-HisGST-pET15bTEV was chosen for expression of recombinant SARS-CoV nsp1 for these reasons. Upon development of the purification protocol, it was found that sufficiently high purity was obtained by IMAC, followed by removal of high molecular weight aggregates by SEC.

The preparation of a stable protein sample was an important goal, and is required prior to placing significant efforts into structural and biophysical studies. The protein was also resistant to proteolytic degradation. While no explicit proteolytic digestion assays were performed on the sample, there was no indication that native E. coli proteases caused any observable degradations either pre- or post-lysis. The lack of proteolytic degradation is important for easily obtaining a homogeneous sample. It is an indication that the protein maintains a globular fold, hindering proteolysis.",

The experimentally derived composition displayed reasonable agreement with the consensus prediction based on amino acid sequence alone. The major deviation between experiment and prediction was the experimental data indicated a higher than expected amount of \u03b2-strand, resulting in a less than expected amount of random coil. Having more residues in a regular secondary structure conformation likely aids the stabilization of the protein, and is an indication of a well folded protein. However, it should be noted that the program k2d, used to analyze the CD data, considers random coil to include all residues that do not participate in an \u03b1-helix or a \u03b2-strand, and this term does not imply that such residues lack a defined and stable structure within a given protein. The experimentally determined composition of 28% \u03b1-helix, 33% \u03b2-strand, and 39% random coil is consistent with values observed for other proteins having a globular fold. For example, using the same CD protocol, we have determined the secondary structure composition of another SARS-CoV protein (nsp9) as being 10% \u03b1-helix, 39% \u03b2-strand, and 51% random coil (unpublished results). These values compare extremely well with the values (13% \u03b1-helix, 35% \u03b2-strand, and 52% random coil) calculated from its crystal structure (PDB: 1UW7). Hen egg white lysozyme (PDB: 1HEW) and bovine trypsin (PDB: 1GBT) contain approximately 50% and 54%, respectively, of their residues in other than \u03b1-helical or \u03b2-strand conformations, based upon their crystal structures.",

This method provided an estimated molecular weight for the purified recombinant SARS-CoV nsp1 of \u223c37 kDa and indicated that it was present predominantly as a single species. These data can be interpreted as the protein being present as a dimer in solution, as the calculated mass of a monomer is 20.2 kDa. However, molecular weight estimation by traditional SEC is limited by the assumptions that the protein sample interacts with the column resin in an ideal fashion (e.g., no electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions), and the individual protein particles (monomers or complexes) are approximately spherical, as the elution profile is influenced not only by molecular weight but also by molecular shape.",

The sole role of SEC in a SEC\u2013MALS experiment is to maximize the homogeneity of the sample being analyzed by MALS at any given instant, as MALS provides a weighted average of the molecular weight of all species in the aliquot under analysis. Molecular weight estimation by MALS is largely independent of molecular shape, and so the SEC\u2013MALS results are influenced substantially less by non-ideal sample behavior then when using SEC alone. Analysis of 14 protein standards showed that the SEC\u2013MALS method can routinely estimate molecular weights of native proteins within 5% [29]. SEC\u2013MALS indicates that purified SARS-CoV nsp1 is present as a monodisperse monomeric population weighing 19.6 kDa in solution. The disagreement between the SEC and the SEC\u2013MALS molecular weight estimations may be due to non-ideal interactions between the protein and the SEC media. However, it is likely an indication that the protein\u2019s shape deviates significantly from spherical (e.g., oblate or prolate).
