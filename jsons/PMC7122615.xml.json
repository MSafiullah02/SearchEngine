            "text": "The predominant site of RSV infection in the immunocompetent human respiratory tract is the columnar epithelium lining the conducting airways. Columnar airway epithelium serves as an important innate barrier in the respiratory tract and possesses highly specialized functions due to the distinct features of diverse columnar epithelial cell-types present throughout the airways. How RSV infection affects the integrity and innate defenses of the human airway epithelium resulting in airway disease is still not clearly defined. Whether outcomes of RSV infection of nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines or semipermissive animal models in vivo reflect those of RSV infection of human columnar airway epithelial cells is currently under investigation. Although in vivo human challenge protocols are available and are an excellent model system for assessing consequences of RSV infection and testing the efficacy of RSV vaccine candidates and anti-virals, these studies are limited to inoculation of the nasal epithelium and provide little information on RSV pathogenesis in lower airway regions. Human in vivo challenge studies are also cost-prohibitive to most in the RSV field; they require specialized facilities, personnel and appropriate review by regulatory agencies. Therefore, more cost effective and widely available models of human columnar airway epithelium have been sought to further understand how RSV infection affects the normal functions of the airway epithelium and how altering epithelium function influences RSV pathogenesis. Such in vitro models also hold great utility for preclinical testing of infection and growth phenotypes of live, attenuated RSV vaccine candidates and assessing the efficacy of RSV antiviral approaches.",

Technical aspects associated with isolation and culture of human airway epithelial cell cultures will not be further discussed here and the reader is referred to a comprehensive description of these protocols (Fulcher et al. 2005). The availability of airway cell culture models relies on an abundant primary source of airway epithelial cells isolated from the lungs of human donors. In our laboratory, human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE) are generated from epithelial cells isolated from human nasal or tracheobronchial epithelium obtained from cadaver airways or excess airway tissues after lung transplantation or elective surgery. An alternative source of human airway cells is from volunteers willing to undergo harvest of epithelial cells by scraping or brushing of nasal or tracheobronchial epithelium. Regardless of the method of procurement, isolated epithelial cells can then be grown using appropriate culture conditions to generate differentiated cultures of columnar airway epithelium. In our experience and that of others, HAE cultures exhibit morphologic and physiologic properties similar to those of the human columnar airway epithelium in vivo.",

Although ciliated airway epithelial cells are predominant throughout the conducting airways of all species, both ciliated cell density and the phenotype of nonciliated cells are airway region and species dependent (Harkema et al. 1994). For humans, the cartilaginous conducting airway epithelium (nasal, tracheobronchial, bronchial) is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium with predominant ciliated cells interspersed with variable numbers of mucin-secreting cells. In these airway regions, columnar cells overlie basal epithelial cells directly attached to the underlying basement membrane. Ciliated cells are also prominent in the human small, noncartilaginous bronchiolar airways but their numbers decrease as the bronchioles approach the airspaces of the alveolar regions. In the cartilaginous airways, nonciliated columnar cells largely represent the morphology and properties of classic mucin-secreting cells (Goblet cells) whereas, the nonciliated columnar cells in the bronchiolar regions are most often identified as Clara cells. Distal to the conducting airways, the lung epithelium consists of Type I and Type II pneumocytes.",

However, ciliated cell tropism in these models is not unique to RSV since parainfluenza viruses (human PIV1-5, Sendai virus), human/avian influenza viruses, and coronaviruses exhibit preferential infection of ciliated cells in these models (Zhang et al. 2005, 2012; Scull et al. 2009; Sims et al. 2005; Villenave et al. 2012; Bartlett et al. 2008a; Schaap-Nutt et al. 2010). Indeed, by comparing infection of HAE with different respiratory viruses we and others have found human influenza viruses are the only respiratory viruses so far tested that infect both ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells of HAE (Scull et al. 2009; Matrosovich et al. 2004). The significance of expanded virus tropism for both ciliated and nonciliated cells with regards to outcomes of influenza virus infection is unknown but we speculate influenza virus evolution in human hosts towards nonciliated columnar cells may provide an advantage to the virus against innate host defenses.\n",

An estimated 60\u201390 % of lumenal surface cells in HAE are ciliated cells (Zhang et al. 2009), with the remainder of columnar cells resembling mucin-secreting Goblet cells found in human airway epithelium in vivo (Fig. 2). However, other less common \u201csecretory columnar cell-types\u201d are occasionally identified in HAE although these columnar cell-types are not commonly found in human airways in vivo (Fig. 2). Thus, for the most part, the columnar cell composition of HAE closely mimics columnar cell density and phenotype of the columnar epithelium of the human nasal and tracheobronchial airway regions in vivo. In our experience, we have not routinely identified Clara cells in HAE; an expected finding given the isolation of cells from large airway regions where Clara cells are scarce. Isolation of airway epithelial cells from human bronchiolar airways where Clara cell density is high has not yet successfully resulted in differentiated cultures with columnar epithelial cells displaying morphologic characteristics of Clara cells in vivo. Primary cultures for human alveolar Type II pneumocytes are available and currently await studies with RSV infection (Bove et al. 2011).\n",

One explanation for these observations is the greater abundance of extracellular glycocalyx present on the lumenal surface of ciliated cells when compared to that on the surfaces of nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines (Kesimer et al. 2009, 2012). It is expected RSV and other viruses that infect ciliated cells will have to negotiate the more complex glycocalyx structure and these viruses have likely evolved strategies to enable this. Indeed, we have shown columnar cell glycocalyx in HAE poses a significant diffusion barrier to respiratory viruses reaching the apical membranes of columnar cells (Stonebraker et al. 2004; Kesimer et al. 2012). The robust glycocalyx of the columnar airway epithelium is largely due to the abundance of several families of carbohydrate-rich molecules, including proteoglycans, glycolipids, and glycoproteins most notably, the highly O-glycosylated \u2018tethered\u2019 mucins MUC1, 4, and 16. These tethered mucins constitute a significant portion of the glycocalyx structure in human and murine airway epithelia (Kesimer et al. 2012; Stonebraker et al. 2004; Button et al. 2012).",

We have speculated the RSV G glycoprotein may serve to facilitate the passage of RSV into the glycocalyx layer. This idea was based on data showing recombinant RSV deleted the G protein (RSV\u0394G) infected nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines just as efficiently as wild-type virus suggesting the G protein was not required for infection (Karron et al. 1997). In contrast to these previous findings in nonpolarized epithelial cells, we recently showed RSV infection of HAE is significantly increased when the virus expresses a full-length G protein (Kwilas et al. 2009). While RSV efficiently infects and spreads in HAE, RSV\u0394G poorly infects ciliated cells and displays attenuated growth characteristics in HAE (Kwilas et al. 2009). Since RSV G has been previously described as a \u201cmucin-like\u201d glycoprotein with the potential for multiple O-glycosylation sites (Collins 1990), we speculate one function of G may be to facilitate the negotiation of RSV through the robust glycocalyx layer present on the lumenal surface of polarized airway epithelial cells. These studies highlight just one example of the utility of HAE to better model in vivo virus\u2013host airway cell interactions when compared to nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines.",

However, in contrast to RSV\u0394G growth in HAE, only the initial inoculum of VERO cell-derived RSV was attenuated in HAE and subsequent rounds of infection within HAE cultures proceeded similarly to those after inoculation with RSV propagated in HEp-2 cells (Fig. 3). Subsequently, it was discovered the G glycoprotein of RSV propagated in HEp-2 cells had a molecular mass of 90 kD while the G from VERO cell-derived RSV was only 55 kD suggesting VERO-derived G was deficient is some component important for efficient infection of ciliated cells. Although the numbers of ciliated cells infected by VERO cell-derived RSV were lower than for HEp-2 derived RSV, progeny virions budding from ciliated cells infected by VERO-derived RSV quickly regained normal infection kinetics suggesting deficiencies in G function for RSV propagated in VERO cells were possibly due to altered post-transcriptional modification of G in VERO cells and not due to genetic alterations in the virus genome. The significance of the different molecular masses for G protein derived from different producer cell-lines remains to be determined but only became apparent using HAE as the target cells for infection. Precisely, how the RSV G protein may be modified in producer cell-lines to account for these differences in mass and infectivity for ciliated cells is under investigation.\n",

HAE cultures are derived from individual donors with a strong possibility of genetic and environmental variability between donors. When using HAE there are two practical considerations when designing experiments. First, the total number of primary cells and hence, HAE cultures, derived from an individual donor will always be limiting. Human primary airway epithelial cells grown on plastic can be passaged several times to increase cell availability, but the ability to reproducibly differentiate these cells into ciliated columnar epithelium wanes in later passages. Attempts to generate \u2018human primary epithelial cell-lines\u2019 have successfully generated cultures of pseudostratified columnar airway epithelium however, the extent of ciliated cell differentiation in these cultures does not approach the ciliated cell densities achievable with freshly isolated primary epithelial cells (Fulcher et al. 2009). The second practical concern when using HAE relates to the potential for variability due to differences in host genetics and/or environmental exposures between individual donors. Currently, the only feasible method to determine variability in experimental outcomes between HAE derived from different donors is empirical testing of the specific experimental outcome, e.g., virus growth kinetics, across cultures derived from several different donors (i.e., 4\u20137 different donors).",

HAE cultures derived from different donors can then be used in identical experiments and variability assessed. If variability is low, data can be aggregated across all HAE used. For example, PIV1 infection and growth kinetics in human ciliated cells of HAE was highly reproducible both between cultures derived from an individual donor and HAE derived from 5 different donors (Bartlett et al. 2008a, b). Similar data were obtained for influenza viruses (Scull et al. 2009) and PIV2 (Schaap-Nutt et al. 2012). However, in our experience, not all experimental outcomes are as consistent between donors. For example, although PIV2 infection kinetics between donors were identical, significant differences in inflammatory mediator production was determined between donors (Schaap-Nutt et al. 2012); thus, highlighting the requirement to confirm reproducibility of experimental outcomes both between cultures and donor sources.",

Generally, live, attenuated vaccine candidates exhibit a greater degree of growth attenuation in HAE models than in nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines and the degree of attenuation in HAE more closely mimics that measured in vivo. A human adenoid airway epithelium culture model was used to demonstrate that live, attenuated RSV vaccine growth kinetics in differentiated cultures, but not that in cell-lines, closely resembled the kinetics of vaccine growth in airways of human and nonhuman primates in vivo (Wright et al. 2005). Figure 4 illustrates similar experiments with a live, attenuated PIV2 vaccine that showed decreased virus growth in HAE compared to PIV2 wild-type at 32 \u00b0C (the temperature of the nasal cavity) whereas, cell-lines showed no differences in growth kinetics between the PIV2 vaccine and PIV2 wild-type (Schaap-Nutt et al. 2010). The discrepancy between differences in attenuation of the PIV2 vaccine in HAE versus cell-lines was more dramatic when experiments were performed at 37 \u00b0C (the temperature of the lower airways). While PIV2 wild-type grew well in HAE at 37 \u00b0C, the vaccine candidate was severely attenuated essentially showing zero growth. In contrast to these data in HAE, the vaccine candidate was only modestly attenuated compared to PIV2 wild-type in epithelial cell-lines at 37 \u00b0C. The relevance of these in vitro findings was demonstrated when PIV2 wild-type and vaccine candidate growth kinetics were determined in the upper and lower airways of nonhuman primates in vivo where the degree of growth attenuation for the vaccine candidate versus wild-type virus closely mimicked that in HAE but not in epithelial cell-lines. Recently, similar conclusions were reached for influenza virus vaccines where differentiated airway epithelium culture models far better predicted in vivo growth kinetics of vaccine candidates than epithelial cell-lines (Ilyushina et al. 2012).\n",

The cellular cross-talk between epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and infiltrating cells of the immune system is highly complex and ideally results in an appropriate, but not exaggerated, inflammatory response sufficient to clear virus infection. A significant drawback of human airway epithelium culture models for respiratory virus vaccine research is the lack of these other immune-related cell-types in this culture model.",

Global \u2018whole culture\u2019 analysis of secreted inflammatory mediators in culture washes can be performed at the protein level by ELISA or antibody/bead-based technologies. For example, the magnitude and duration of two secreted pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-8 and CXCL10 were measured by Luminex bead-based technology in the serosal media of RSV-infected HAE (Fig. 5). Alternatively, whole culture mRNA gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR provides a cost-effective approach for determining inflammatory responses to virus infections. These commonly used assays for measuring inflammatory mediator profiles measure protein secretion or changes in mRNA expression from whole HAE cultures in which differences in cell-types present, some infected, others not, can complicate interpretation of the data. Unfortunately, in our hands, attempts to isolate ciliated cell populations or RSV-infected ciliated cell populations from HAE by proteolytic dispersion or laser-capture dissection, significantly reduced mRNA integrity and invalidated conclusions drawn from these assays.\n",

Existing evidence already indicates differentiated airway epithelium culture models more accurately predict in vivo virus-host airway cell interactions, virus growth kinetics and consequences of infection than nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines. The ability to compare virus infection in ciliated airway epithelium in vitro versus in vivo, e.g., for PIV infection of hamster airways, will strengthen the concept that airway cultures can be used as a precursor and/or surrogate model for in vivo studies. For RSV, direct comparison between infection of HAE in vitro versus in vivo is a significant challenge due to the inability to perform detailed experiments on humans especially in lower airway regions. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on correlating the consequences of RSV infection of human airway epithelium culture models to histopathologic findings in lower airways of patients naturally infected by RSV.\n",

For example, the GPI virus does not induce as much IL-8 as the recombinant expressing GFP or Hep-4. In contrast, for CXCL10 secretion, Hep-4 does not induce as much CXCL10 secretion as the other two RSV inoculates. Since cultures are derived from the same donor, host genetic variability is unlikely to account for these differences.
