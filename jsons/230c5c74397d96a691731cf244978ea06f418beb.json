            "text": "The aim of this study was to design a high density multiepitope protein, which can be a promising multiepitope vaccine candidate against Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Initially, conserved and antigenic helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes in the HEV capsid protein were predicted by in silico analysis. Subsequently, a multiepitope comprising four HTL epitopes with high-affinity binding to the HLA molecules was designed, and repeated four times as high density multiepitope construct. This construct was synthesized and cloned into pET-30a (\u00fe) vector. Then, it was transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The high density multiepitope protein was purified by Ni-NTA agarose and concentrated using Amicon filters. Finally, the immunological properties of this high density multiepitope protein were evaluated in vitro. The results showed that the high density multiepitope construct was successfully expressed and purified. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses showed the presence of a high density multiepitope protein band of approximately 33 kDa. Approximately 1 mg of the purified protein was obtained from each liter of the culture media. Moreover, the purified multiepitope protein was capable of induction of proliferation responses, IFN-g ELISPOT responses and IFN-g and IL-12 cytokines production in a significant level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HEV-recovered individuals compared to the control group. In conclusion, the newly produced multiepitope protein can induce significant T helper type 1 responses in vitro, and can be considered as a novel strategy for the development of HEV vaccines in the future.",

At least four major HEV genotypes have been identified, which have different geographical distributions and host ranges [Xing et al., 2011] . Despite classification into four geographically distinct genotypes, the HEV strains antigenically belong to a single serotype and share cross-reacting epitopes due to the high degree of sequence conservation [Wang and Zhuang, 2004; Xing et al., 2011] . Genotype 1 includes most of human HEV strains which is endemic in Asia and North Africa, genotype 2 is identified in human and includes the Mexican strain and few strains of African countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been identified in pigs and other animals; however, humans can be infected with these two genotypes too. Genotype 3 predominates in industrialized countries, and genotype 4 is endemic in Asia, particularly China, Taiwan, and Japan Yamashita et al., 2009] .",

The sequences were aligned by MEGA software version 4.0 (Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) [Tamura et al., 2007] , and then the conserved sequences among these Strandard strains were determined. The highly conserved HEV-derived HLA-DR-restricted HTL epitopes of these strains were predicted by SYFPEITHI online software (http://www.syfpeithi.de/ home.htm). HLA-DR binding affinity of the predicted epitopes was determined by IEDB Analysis Resource online program (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/analyze/html/mhc_II_binding.html). Genetic diversity of MHC molecules is very high in human population; therefore HTL epitopes with high population coverage are needed for this study. Four epitopes with highaffinity to the most common HLA-DR alleles in Iran and world population were selected. Therefore it is predicted that this construct could cover the most world population. The four HTL epitopes (15 amino acids) derived from HEV capsid protein including HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 1501 (A150-164), HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 0701 (B320-334), HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 1101 (C370-384), HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 0401 and HLA-DRB3 \u00c3 0101 (DR52) (D491-505)restricted epitopes were binded to each other as a linear multiepitope (ABCD). To avoid creation of junctional epitopes, the construct was designed with amino acid spacer sequences (Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro-Gly) between sequential HTL epitopes [Livingston et al., 2002; Depla et al., 2008] . The four times repeated multiepitope was constructed as high density multiepitope (Fig. 1A) . Based on E. coli codon usage, the nucleotide sequence of the high density multiepitope gene was optimized using GenScript Rare Codon Analysis Tool (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) for efficient expression. In order to simplify the purification of the target protein, a sequence encoding 8-His tag was added at the C-terminal of the optimized gene followed by adding two stop codons (TAA and TAG) to terminate protein synthesis. Two restriction-enzyme digestion sites, NdeI and XhoI, were placed in the both ends of the codon-optimized gene to subclone it into the pET30a (\u00fe) vector.",

To date, no application of multiple HLA-DR-restricted epitopes was reported to induse HTL responses against HEV infection. Oany et al. designed a multiepitope vaccine candidate compromising B cell and T cell epitopes from spike protein of human coronavirus by in silico analysis. In their study, sequences of the spike proteins were collected from the UniProtKB database and the consereved epitopes with high-affinity binding to the different HLA molecules were predicted using in silico tools to cover the majority of the world population. This computational design was a novel study to determine antigenic epitopes in spike protein and to design an epitope-based vaccine against human coronavirus [Oany et al., 2014] .",

Meanwhile, some disadvantages like the creation of junctional epitopes in the sequential arrangement of the epitopes have limited using these constructs [Livingston et al., 2002; Depla et al., 2008] . Junctional epitopes is created by the juxtaposition of two epitopes, and can suppress the immune responses to the main epitopes [Livingston et al., 2002] . This problem was overcome through application of the spacer residues between the epitopes to improve appropriate epitope processing. Furthermore, it has been reported that if the epitope is expressed with high density will enhance protective immunity [Liu et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2008] . Lu et al. designed constructs consisting of various V3 epitope densities from HIV-1 gp120, and found that high epitope density in one single protein molecule could enhance protective immunity [Lu et al., 2008] . Liu et al. reported that high epitope density from M2 protein of influenza virus enhanced specific humoral immunity against flu virus [Liu et al., 2004] .",

Fast cultivation, well-known genetics and high-level expression capabilities with high purity are some other advantages of E. coli expression system [Fakruddin et al., 2013] . Despite all these advantages, expression of a foreign gene in E. coli may be hampered by the presence of rare codons and high GC contents within the gene-coding region which result in decrease of the expression level or production of insoluble and nonfunctional proteins [Mondal et al., 2013; Elena et al., 2014] .

The IPTG-induction is economically desirable method and increases protein production [Mondal et al., 2013] .
