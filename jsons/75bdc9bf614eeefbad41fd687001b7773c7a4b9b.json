            "text": "Although research into the mechanisms of virus infection is carried out by many sections of the scientific community, the search for antiviral drugs is almost exclusively the province of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The reasons for this are partly historical, but chiefly it is because the facilities for running large-scale screening programs are expensive and can only be met by commercial and, occasionally, governmental resources. Because of the need to protect their discoveries from unauthorized exploitation, a good deal of secrecy inevitably surrounds the work being carried out in commercial organizations. This secrecy is regrettable but necessary, since the survival of such organizations depends largely then on getting a fair financial return on the money invested by them in research. The security aspects of commercial research naturally restrict frank and constructive discussions between competitors as well as third parties, and this has been particularly true in antiviral research.",

It is in these areas where drugs would be useful, and it is on these diseases that efforts should be concentrated. The two most important human diseases in this class are influenza and the common cold. When a novel strain of influenza appears among the human population, as happened in 1933, 1947, and 1956, existing immunity to the previous current influenza strain is not effective, and widespread epidemics of disease occur. The disease spreads so rapidly after it first appears that it is not possible to develop, distribute, and administer a vaccine based on the new strain soon enough to protect useful numbers of the population. Even after the initial overwhelming pandemic, successive epidemics will occur as the disease penetrates into pockets of the community that 'had escaped infection. The disease is then maintained partly by the continuing appearance of susceptible juveniles, partly by spontaneous antigenic modifications in the virus enabling it to overcome previous immunity, and partly by the general decline in immunity of other individuals with the passage of time. After the initial pandemic, it is theoretically possible to control the disease with widespread vaccination, but in practice this is not done. Consequently the disease smoulders on in the community, appearing as isolated cases and occasional outbreaks and epidemics. These are the conditions under which the disease normally exists, and it is this situation, rather than the much publicized pandemics, which causes the greatest economic loss to industrialized countries. The overall loss in 1956-1957 in Great Britain due to the Asian influenza pandemic was estimated at X100 million, but the continuing loss, from that time on has been at least X30 million each year. Losses in Europe, North America, Japan, and similar industrialized communities must be romparablr, and if only a fraction of the disease could be prevented by a drug, the economic benefits would be enormous.",

The careful study of Lidwell and Williams (1961) showed that approximately 11 X lo6 working days arc lost cach year in Great Britain alone from the common cold. Scvertheless, the prospects for a common cold vaccine are poor because of the large number of viruses which are known to cause the disease. There are 89 known rhinoviruses (Kapikian, 1971) , probably a comparable number of as yct unclassified rhinoviruses, a growing catalog of coronaviruses (Kapikian, 1969) , and a selection of other viruses including myxoviruses, adenoviruses, and herpcsviruses (Tyrrell, 1965) , all of which have been isolated from clinical colds. It is the serological diversity of these etiological agents which makes the prospects for a vaccine so poor, and the common cold must, therefore, be considered as a target, even though a difficult target, for antiviral drugs.",

The first is that circulating antibodies appear in only small amounts in respiratory mucus, and, consequently, the degree of protection afforded to the respiratory tract is less and of shorter duration than might be expected. The second problem has been brought to light by the use of experimental vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants. When infants who had been vaccinated parenterally against this disease contracted the natural disease, they were more ill than infants who had not received the vaccine. The reason seems to be that the circulating antibodies resulting from parenteral vaccinations not only offer little protection to the respiratory tract, but when a natural infection occurs, these antibodies combine with the virus antigens at the surface of the respiratory epithelial cclls causing an inflammatory response with a corresponding increase in the severity of clinical symptoms Kim et al., 1969; Kapikian et al., 1969) . Chanock et a2. (1970) have pointed out that if an immunopathological process involving serum antibodies occurs during respiratory syncytial virus infection, then stimulation of local, respiratory tract, secretory antibody by intranasal instillation of live or inactivated virus may give adequate protection without unwanted hyperreactivity.",

With freeranging animals the duration of protection from a single dose would need to be prolonged to offset the labor of administering the dose. Also, it is easier to dose herds by injection than by mouth, so that certain veterinary antiviral drugs may not be required in an orally active formulation. Conversely, oral dosing, preferably by an addition to food or drinking water, is the most convenient way of dosing poultry.",

Because of this, it is usually assumed that antiviral drugs will only be of value in preventing and not in curing virus diseases. Nevertheless, although the periods of virus growth in infected individuals may be short, they may well be long enough to allow useful therapy. For example, Pate1 et al. (1964) have shown in volunteers infected intranasally with Coxsackie A21 virus that maximum virus growth precedes the onset of symptoms by 24 hours. But from their work it may be seen that a considerable amount of virus growth is concurrent with the period of overt symptoms, and application of antiviral drugs during this period of 2-3 days might well prevent the full development of the disease. The work of Douglas et al. (1966) with volunteers shows that a similar period exists in acute rhinovirus infections, and Dawkins et al. (1968) and Wingfield et al.

Bauer (1967) has suggested that the larger the virus, the more susceptible it is to inhibition, since, for any given intracellular concentration of drug, a large virus will encompass, both physically and in terms of synthetic requirements, more drug molecules than a small one. Undoubtedly, this principle will contribute to our observed high rate of inhibition of influenza virus, but another important factor seems to be that the adsorption of influenza viruses to cellular receptors is particularly vulnerable to interference by extraneous substances.",

Of course, if wide-spectrum leads appear, the choice of test virus may be irrelevant, but the antiviral compounds (as distinct from interferon inducers) known at present are characterized by their relatively limited spectrum of activity, e.g., methisazone is active only against poxviruses (Bauer and Sadler, 1960) and possibly adenoviruses (Bauer and Apostolov, 1966) ; l-aminoadamantane is active only against influenza A1 and As and not against other myxo-or paramyxoviruses (Davies et al., 1964) ; guanidine and a-hydroxybenzyl benzimidazole are active only against picornaviruses and not against other small ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (Eggers and Tamm, 1961) .

Several ingenious methods have been devised for measuring these two responses-cytotoxicity and virus growth-all designed to facilitate the screening of large numbers of compounds. For example, Herrmann et al. (1960) devised a zone-inhibition test in which large flat dishes of chicken cells were infected with test virus, overlaid with agar containing a vital stain, and paper discs impregnated with test compounds placed on the surface of the agar. Compounds with antiviral activity showed two concentric zones around the paper disc, the innermost being pale in color due to the destruction of host cells by cytotoxic concentrations of compound diffusing from the disc. Outside this was a deeply staining zone where cells were exposed to nontoxic concentrations of compound which also protected them from the destructive effects of the virus with which they had been infected. Beyond this, where the concentration of compound was too low to protect the cells, the cell sheet was destroyed by virus and stained poorly. Thus, by visual inspection of the dishes after 3 to 4 days, active compounds could be quickly detected.",

Thus, by incubating virus-infected cells in a series of concentrations of a compound and then looking for the cultures that had changed the color of the phenol red indicator in their medium from pink to yellow, active compounds could be detected. This technique has also been used to assay neutralizing antibody and interferon action (Pauker, 1965). Finter (1970) described a system whereby the cytotoxic effects of test compounds could be assayed by the reduction in the amount of neutral red taken up by treated cells, and, similarly, the cytopathic effects of virus growth could be quantitated by measuring the reduction in the uptake of neutral red by infected cells. The system can readily be adapted to the screening of test compounds for antiviral activity. If myxoviruses are used in this system, because their cytopathic effects may not be pronounced, their growth is best monitored, not by a reduction in neutral red uptake, but by a quantitative hemadsorption method which matches the neutral red uptake method in its accuracy and sensitivity (Finter, 1964) . In contrast to the eone-inhibition and pH-swing tests, the neutral red uptake test is precise in operation and may be used to demonstrate fine differences in the relative toxicity and activity of test compounds; it is probably no more timeconsuming than the former tests.",

(1970) and has been used to screen Compounds and mold metabolites for antiviral activity (Miller et ul.,  1968) . For the test, HeLa cells were suspended in a medium containing uridine-3H. If a test compound has toxic effects on the HeLa cells, then the cellular R S A synthesis, as measured by u r i d i n~-~H fixation, will be reduced. Similarly, if cells are infected with an R S A virus and treated with sctinomycin D. then R S A synthesis will be due to virus growth only. Thus, if test compounds reduce this virus-directed RXA synthesis at concentrations that do not affect cellular R S A synthesis, then the compound is exerting a specific effect on virus growth. The test can also be used for deoxyribonucleic acid (DSA) viruses, the cellular and virus DXA synthesis being monitored by including th~midine-~H in the medium. Virus DSA synthesis is distinguished from cellular DSA synthesis by disrupting the cells at the end of the test and treating them with dcoxyribonuclease when encapsulated virus DSA is resistant to digestion and the unprotected host cell DSA is not. Thus, the selective effect of test compounds on the synthesis of virus DSA can be measured. The authors claim that the system operates satisfactorily ivith a range of viruses-some of them important disease organisms-and is simple, reliable, and rapid. The chief criticism of this method is that, because nucleic acid synthesis is used as the sole measure of virus growth, test compounds that might act on subsequent stages in the virus replicative cycle may not be detected. For example, any disturbances in the sequencing of virus nucleic acid, inhibition of structural protein synthesis, or failure of assembly or release of mature virions, would provide a sound basis for a useful drug, but these phenomena may not be detected in this type of test. Also, since high infecting doses of virus are used to give satisfactory operation of this test (up to 15 virus particles per cell), the test may be rather insensitive in detecting antiviral activity. All antiviral activity is, in the broadest sense, competitive, either a t the level of cellular membrane receptors or at an cnzymic or template level. Thus, the more virus is used to initiate infection, the less effective an antiviral compound is likely to be. Although this factor will not turn a highly active compound into an inactive one, it may well obscure low levels of activity which might be useful starting points for chemical exploitation. The real value of Miller's test is the use of the important biochemical system of nucleic acid synthesis to monitor the toxic manifestations of test compounds.

It may be objected that this system would be unworkable where large numbers of compounds are being screened because of the correspondingly large numbers of microscopic examinations required; but given a good low-power microscope, an experienced reader, and the fact that most random compounds tested will show no antiviral activity and will, therefore, not require more than a cursory examination, the system is reliable, fast, and economical.

Although this compound is not a specific inhibitor of RNA synthesis, the inhibition of RNA synthesis and the production of cytopathic effects run close together. At concentrations that indirectly affect the nucleic acid synthesis, sufficient disturbance is caused in other areas of the cellular metabolism to lead to a general cytopathic effect. Cell division is affected a t lower concentrations and in this particular case, inhibitory (and therefore toxic) effects can be detected with concentrations 10 times lower than those that cause cell destruction, Nevertheless, even with cell growth as a measure of toxicity, and effects on the cellular growth rate (&-A) are higher than those that suppress virus growth, indicating that ICI 65,709 is exerting a specific effect on virus growth. (50% end points: CPE, 10 pg/ml; RNA synthesis, 10 pglml; cell growth, 1.5 pg/ml; virus growth, 0.05 pg/ml.) there is a clear margin between the toxic and antiviral effects, as may be seen from the virus yield curve. Fusidic acid, which has been reported to show specific antiviral activity in tissue culture (Acornley et al., 1967) , was also tested in the same way (Fig. 2) . In this case, the concentration causing 50% cytopathic effect after 48 hours was 100 pg/ml, whereas virus yield was depressed to 50% by only 3 pg/lml, giving an apparent therapeutic ratio of 33. But when the effects of fusidic acid on cellular synthesis were studied, it was clear that cellular RKA synthesis was drastically reduced by 3 pg,!ml. Thus, fusidic acid probably reduces virus growth by inhibiting cellular, rather than virus, synthetic processes, and probably accounts for the fact that this compound showed no clinically useful effects in virus-infected volunteers, despite good levels of drug in blood and nasal secretions (Acornley et al., 1967) .",

Our technique is to excise a trachea and cut it transversely into rings 1-2 mm thick. These are placed in 3 X 3 in. tubes with 1 ml of Eagle's medium and rolled exactly as conventional tissue cultures. With a low-power microscope the ciliary activity of the respiratory epithelium is assessed on an arbitrary scale of 0 to 4. In the presence of a test compound, the reduction of ciliary action is a highly sensitive measure of compound toxicity, and it is easy to determine the concentration at which full ciliary activity can be maintained (Fig. 3) . At lower concentrations the effects on virus growth may be measured by harvesting the culture fluid at intervals and titrating for infectious virus. By using this technique, we have found that almost 70% of the so-called active compounds produced by a tissue culture screen against influenza A appear negative when tested in ferret tracheal cultures. In almost all cases, compounds were toxic at lower concentrations in tracheal cultures than in conventional tissue culture monolayers, as judged by a cessation of ciliary activity. In a proportion of these compounds, some data concerning their biochemical action were available, and in most cases these drugs were uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, nucleic acid inhibitors, or general antimetabolites. The inhibition of ciliary action in tracheal cultures is, therefore; a much more sensitive index of toxic effects than morphological changes in monolayers.",

Because of thcir simplicity, cytopathic effect and hcmadsorption are widdy used, hut these techniques must be used with some precautions if certain types of antiviral activity are not to be missed. In order to speed up the rate of antiviral testing, the quantity of challenge virus is often increased to a theoretical maximum of 1 virus particle per cell. The whole cell culture then behaves synchronously, and results are obtained in whatever time the virus takes to complete its replicative cycle-usually between 10 and 20 hours. With this procedure, however. a test compound that prevented the formation of infectious virus but was unable to protect the infected cell from destruction would not be detected. For example, in a relatively complex virus, such as influenza, it is not difficult to imagine that RNA synthesis could be interrupted while hemagglutinin production continued, much as it does in the Van Magnus effect. The result would be a monolayer showing full hemadsorption and yet no transmissible virus would have been formed. Test compounds that produce this effect would be of great interest as potential drugs but could be missed in tests where the dose of challenge virus is too high. Wherever possible, tests should permit several cycles of virus growth to occur so that compounds that interrupt any part of the cycle may be detected.",

Furthermore, the literature discloses that some highly irrelevant viruses are being used in animal test systems and that, even when human pathogens are used, e.g., influenza, they require extensive adaption to their animal host and the course of the disease is usually very different from that in humans. Finally, there are no convenient animal models for studying the growth of human rhino-and coronaviruses and, unless tissue culture tests are used, there could be no screening for antiviral compounds against these important pathogens. There is, therefore, no convincing theoretical advantage in using animals for routine antiviral screens.

There are five main reasons for this. First, a relatively benign human virus infection will often follow a very different, and often severe course in an animal. For example, influenza virus, herpes simplex, and coxsackie viruses may cause much more serious diseases in laboratory animals than they do in man. Second, human viruses often must be adapted by multiple passaging before they will grow satisfactorily in animal hosts, and, therefore, the challenge virus in the animal model may be a very different creature from the original human pathogen. Third, the quantity of virus administered to an animal in order to produce some measurable effect, e.g., symptoms, virus isolation, and seroconversion, is usually vastly greater than would ordinarily be encountered by the natural host, and this can have a profound bearing on the efficacy of any curative agent. For example, Finter (1967) has shown that the protection offered to mice by doses of interferon is greatly increased as the quantity of challenge virus is reduced. Fourth, the fate of a drug when administered t o an animal may be very different from that seen in man. And last, a compound may show toxio effects in man which it did not show in animals. The last two points are probably the most important in determining how far the results obtained with animal models are relevant to man.",

There are no smallanimal modrls of human rhinovirus infections, and the authors, therefore, decided to test the compound in chimpanzees, which are one of the few primates susceptible to human rhinoviruses. Because of lack of knowledge on infectivity of human rhinoviruses for chimpanzees, the authors gave up to 10, OOO TCD,, of challenge virus to each animal to ensurc infcction. The animals were given the drug orally 3 times a day, and the course of the disease was monitored by virus shedding from the nose. The rate of antibody rise was also measured. The numbers of animals in each experiment were necessarily small-usually 2 or 3 treated with drug and 2 or 3 controls. The final results were tantalizingly inconclusive: not clearly negative, nor convincingly positive that the drug had produced a curative effect. The investigators admit that this system is far from satisfactory but conclude from their results that the compound is n-orthwhile studying further in human subjects. The same conclusion, however, would probably have been reached if the compound had been clearly inactive in the chimpanzees, on the grounds that the excessive doses of challenge virus and unknown factors in the chimpanzee metabolism could have led to this result. Animal models of human virus disease must at best be regarded as poor imitations of the natural condition, and results obtained with animal models, whether they are positive or negative, encouraging or discouraging, should be interprcted cautiously and never be used as the sole basis for predicting the outcome in man.",

A disappointing feature of these is their uniformly low activity in man, despite highly promising results in laboratory animals, such as mice, rats, and rabbits. Perhaps the interferon response in man and primates is less important in defense against virus disease than it is in other taxonomic groups. Searches are being made for more general stimulants of host defense mechanisms, for example, stimulators of phagocytosis and the immune response, but very little progress has been reported so far.",

            "text": "The search for drugs that will directly inhibit virus replication, by stopping a virus-coded synthetic process, or the absorption, penetration, uncoating, assembly, or release of virions, has been intensive and is still continuing. Nevertheless, the products of this effort will find application only in a relatively small number of virus diseases for the reasons outlined above. Only for those diseases of high economic importance, and for which no effective vaccines are available, will specific antiviral drugs ever be a commercial reality. The present paucity of such drugs is undoubtedly due largely to the intimate association of viruses at the molecular level with their host cells. For this reason, disease targets must be carefully defined, screening procedures made as meaningful as possible, and the limitations of animal models be clearly recognized. Only by attention to these details can the maximum effort be brought to this difficult problem. Again, the lack of clinically useful drugs allows no more than speculation on the possibilities of drug-resistant viruses emerging when antiviral drugs are eventually in widespread use. The phenomenon of drug resistance in viruses is well established in the laboratory (Melnick et al., 1961; Tamm and Eggers, 1962; Renis and Buthala, 1965) , and, unless potential antiviral drugs are free of this serious defect, their commercial life will be embarrassingly short.",

The short incubation period of many virus diseases will inevitably restrict the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs, and in cases where symptoms have already appeared, the physician and layman alike will have recourse to the extensive armamentanurn of palliatives available for alleviating the symptoms of virus disease. All the same, this is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and the ultimate goal of antiviral research is the prevention of virus disease. As the understanding of viruses increases, so a more rational approach to the chemotherapy of virus diseases will become feasible. Also, random discoveries of antiviral activity in novel chemical compounds will shed further light on those areas of virus metabolism that are susceptible to chemical attack. With increasing con-tributions from both these approaches, virus chemotherapy should soon emerge from a theoretical possibility to a practical reality, and antiviral drugs ivill make their long awaited contributions to clinical medicine.",
