This approach provides insight into how hepatitis and other liver diseases are caused. However, for many plants, their mechanism of action against hepatotoxic agents is not well-documented. The common prototype applied for hepatoprotective drug screening is the carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) induced hepatic injury (Rodrigues et al., 2016) .

However, therapeutic failures or adverse effects have been observed in many cases as pharmacological mechanisms of the herbal mixtures/preparations are not well-studied. The most important concern involving the use of medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the exact method of preparation of an extract, identification of active ingredients and details of administration (Yip & Kwan, 2006) . In this relationship, the screening and characterization of other undiscovered herbal products in traditional medicine is needed.

These substances through a different mechanism of action result in degeneration and inflammation of the liver, which may further result in fibrosis and cirrhosis. The main causes of liver cirrhosis are alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic viral hepatitis (B and C). Although generally, hepatic inflammation is caused by factors such as oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA methylation (Ali et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2016). There are many herbs explored for their hepatoprotective activity through different in vitro and in vivo tests. Some of them have, however, gained importance because of their enormous hepatoprotective potential, and thus attempts are made at a thorough understanding of their mechanism of action in the liver through in vivo experiments. Herbs and their products are generally thought to act as hepatoprotective agents through different mechanisms such as immunomodulation, which means they potentiate and modulate the immune system (Ilyas, Katare, Aeri, & Naseef, 2016). The following sections highlight and explain the hepatoprotective mechanism of action of the following important medicinal plants; Silybum marianum (L.)

In traditional Chinese medicine, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Glycyrrhiza pallidiflora are called Chinese licorice and are among the oldest and most commonly used herbs in the treatment of numerous diseases (Isbrucker & Burdock, 2006). Glycyrrhizin (a glycoside of glycyrrhizic acid) is a triterpene glycoside extracted from roots of licorice (Glycyrrhiza sp.; Kimura et al., 2008; Ram et al., 2006). Kimura et al. (2008) surgically removed about 70% of the total liver in rats and found that administering glycyrrhizin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) through intraperitoneal injections significantly stimulate both liver regeneration and recovery of liver functions possibly via stimulation of EGF receptor.

In another study,Venkateswaran, Millman, and Blumberg (1987) showed the in vitro effect of aqueous extract of Phyllanthus niruri and showed that it inhibits DNA polymerase of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and also binds to the HBV surface antigen. These findings show the potential use of the P. amarus and other Phyllanthus species for the treatment of HBV infection and other liver diseases.3.6 | S. miltiorrhiza Bunge.S. miltiorrhiza Bunge. belongs to the family Lamiaceae and has been widely used in Korea, China, Japan, and some other Asian countries to treat various diseases such as cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetic vascular complications, liver dysfunction, renal deficiency(Han et al., 2008), and chronic hepatitis(Hong et al., 2017). According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia, S. miltiorrhiza is considered to possess slightly cold and bitter properties, enters the heart and liver channels and increases blood flow and scavenges free radicals that decreases cellular damage in patients with ischemic diseases(Sun et al., 2005).Mao et al. (2009) evaluated lipophilic extract of S. miltiorrhiza, which stimulated extra cellular catecholamine secretion. This study showed that S. miltiorrhiza extract plays a key role in of actions of S. miltiorrhiza extracts includes modifying humoral and nonspecific immunity and alleviating hepatotoxicity. The standardized fraction of the root of S. miltiorrhiza (tanshinone I 11.5%; cryptotanshinone 19.1%; and tanshinone IIA 41.0%) protects hepatocytes from lipopolysaccharide and ethanolinduced cell death and suppresses ethanol-induced lipid accumulation. The mechanism involves inhibition of ethanol-induced activation and nuclear translocation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, which trans-activate the target genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, cryptotanshinone blocks the hepatic cell death and fatty acid synthesis and hence has the potential to treat alcoholic liver diseases. These results show that standardized fraction of the roots of S. miltiorrhiza and one of its active ingredient, cryptotanshinone, decreases the risk of alcoholic steatosis and the progression to steatohepatitis (Yin et al., 2009). Park, Zhao, Kim, and Sohn (2009) studied the purified extract of S. miltiorrhiza and its constituents, tanshinone I, cryptotanshinone, and tanshinone-IIA and concluded that it protects the liver against CCl 4induced acute and subacute damage. Their study assessed serum transaminase levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced form of glutathione, and lipid peroxidation levels in the liver and observed that it protects against liver toxicity in vivo and in vitro due to its antioxidant effects. Wasser, Ho, Ang, and Tan (1998) demonstrated that the S. miltiorrhiza can reverse the fibrosis caused by CCl 4 treatment in male Wistar rats. They examined that rats treated with the herb had reduced levels of procollagens I and III, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 transcripts and an increased level of matrix metalloproteinase-13 mRNA as compared with the disease control that significantly decreases CCl 4 -induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.3.7 | A. membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge.A. membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, also known as Radix Astragali in Latin and Huangqi in Chinese, belongs to Fabaceae family(Zhang, Xie, Li, & Fu, 2009) and is commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat liver diseases(Sun, Wei, Wu, Gui, & Wang, 2007). Its roots are amongst the most popular health-promoting herbs in China and their use dates to more than 2,000 years. There is an evidence of the traditional use ofA. membranaceus in Shen Nong's Materia Medica written in the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). Scientific research in the last 20 years has exposed many of the pharmacological functions of different components of this plant. Pharmacological studies of 46 species of the genus Astragalus have reported more than 200 medicinal compounds, including saponins and flavonoids. Studies have reported that crude extracts of Astragalus and isolated constituents are potentially active as an immunostimulant, antiinflammatory, antioxidative, anticancer,antidiabetic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and antiviral activities. In traditional Chinese medicine, Huangqi is often combined with other herbs, such as angelica and ginseng, in various complex prescription formulas. Such herbal formulas have been used for centuries in Asia to treat hepatic inflammation, diabetes, cancers, strokes, kidney infections, and many other diseases (Cho & Leung, of root extract of Paeonia lactiflora and A. membranaceus and demonstrated excellent hepatoprotective activity. They observed approximately 30-60% decrease in CCl 4 -induced elevation of hyaluronic acid, procollagen type-III levels, laminin, hydroxyproline contents, and serum transaminase activities in liver tissue. It also restored the decrease in SOD, and glutathione peroxidase activities decreased the elevation of transforming growth factor-beta-1 and inhibited the formation of lipid peroxidative products during CCl 4 treatment. This inhibited progression of hepatic fibrosis that might be associated with its ability to decrease the level of transforming growth factor beta 1, scavenge free radicals, and inhibit collagen synthesis and proliferation in hepatic stellate cells.3.8 | C. spinosa L.C. spinosa L. (caper), a member of Capparaceae family(Lam & Ng, 2009) is a plant from the dry regions in the west and central Asia, used as a flavoring in cooking(Panico et al., 2005). C. spinosa is employed in traditional medicine since ancient times for the treatment of gout, rheumatism, and liver diseases(Ahmed, Alam, Varshney, & Khan, 2002). The first recorded use of C. spinosa dates back to Sumerians for medicinal purposes in 2000 BC(Romeo, Ziino, Giuffrida, Condurso, & Verzera, 2007). Research on different activities of the plant indicates its enormous antioxidant, anticancer, and antibacterial potential. Studies have shown the bioactivity of extracts from the plant that can be attributed to the polyphenolic compounds present in the plant. It is one of the main constituents of the formulation Liv-52; an herbal treatment commonly used in Indian traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of various liver diseases(Huseini, Alavian, Heshmat, Heydari, & Abolmaali, 2005).Gadgoli and Mishra (1999) found that p-Methoxy benzoic acid, prepared from the aqueous extract of C. spinosa, possesses significant activity against paracetamol and CCl 4 -induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and galactosamine and thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes. They observed the maximum protective effect in concentrations of 1 and 100 mg/ml (milligram of p-methoxy benzoic acid/milliliter) against galactosamine and thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity, respectively. In another study on 36 cirrhotic patients treated with Liv-52 (combination of C. spinosa with other plants) demonstrated decreased serum ALT and AST as well as decreased ascites. This protective effect of Liv-52 can be attributed to the antiinflammatory, diuretic, antioxidative, and immunomodulating effects of the component herbs(Huseini et al., 2005).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Jimoh, Adedapo, & Afolayan, 2010). It is a common herb that grows abundantly in wild and open fields in temperate climate zones(Li, Li, Feng, & Li, 2008) and has been used as a potent hepatoprotective agent(Liu et al., 2016). The fruit of S. nigrum is used in the Mexican folk medicine as a nerve tonic(Perez, Perez, Garcia, & Sossa, 1998;Verma, Rai, Asthana, Jaiswal, & Jaiswal, 2010), and also believed to have antitumor properties(Son et al., 2003).Increased free radical scavenging activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation have been suggested as a possible mechanism of action for the hepatoprotective effects and other medicinal activities of this plant (Prashanth Kumar, Shashidhara, Kumar, & Sridhara, 2001; Sultana, Perwaiz, Iqbal, & Athar, 1995). Lin et al. (2008) observed that the treatment of aqueous extract of S. nigrum effectively lowered the CCl 4 -induced serum levels of hepatic enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and total bilirubin, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals in rats. The hepatic content of glutathione (GSH) and expressions of the antioxidative enzyme; SOD and decreased levels of detoxification enzymes; and glutathione S-transferase were brought back to control levels by the administration of aqueous extract of S. nigrum.

L. coreana belongs to the family Lauraceae and is mainly found in the tropical and subtropical areas. About 74 plant species of the genus Litsea are found in China and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for various diseases. L. coreana is used in traditional Chinese medicines against alcoholic hepatic injury. Different studies have reviewed the enormous pharmacological potential of the plant (Jia, Li, Wan, & He, 2017; Wang, Yuan et al., 2016). The important flavonoids from L. coreana include kaempferol, , and (2R,3R)-epicatechin (Chen et al., 2014). In rats fed with a high-fat diet, flavonoids were assessed for their inhibition on steatohepatitis (also known as fatty liver disease; Jia et al., 2017). Oral administration, in a dose-dependent manner, repressed the levels of total cholesterol, free fatty acid, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the liver and/or serum. Four hundred milligrams per kilogram total flavonoid content from L. coreana almost stopped the formation of steatosis. At the same time, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1, a protein linked with amplified SOD, and reduced malondialdehyde levels were upregulated in rat liver treated with the flavonoids from L. coreana. Flavonoid treatment for 200 and 400 mg/kg alleviated the levels of ALP, ALT, AST, \u03b3-, triglyceride, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, and total cholesterol in liver and serum.On the other hand, SOD and glutathione peroxidase were increased in fat suspension steatohepatitis model of rat.
