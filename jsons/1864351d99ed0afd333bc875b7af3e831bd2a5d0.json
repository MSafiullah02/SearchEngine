            "text": "It is currently not known if repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fundamentally different from those that have not been seen to repeat. One striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration-not a bimodal one-with a correlation between repetition rate and width. Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks, where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale, volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology. It also provides a way of predicting which sources could be seen to repeat in the future.",

To date, approximately 800 FRBs have been detected, of which \u223c 120 have been published (Petroff et al. 2016) and \u223c 700 will be published by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) in a forthcoming catalog (Fonseca et al. 2020 ). The majority of these have not been seen to repeat. In this paper we interchangeably refer to such sources as 'onceoff events' and 'apparent non-repeaters', as we cannot know that they will not repeat in the future. There are 20 FRBs that have been found to repeat, all but two of which were discovered by CHIME (Spitler et al. 2016; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019b,c; Fonseca et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2019) . One of the repeaters, FRB 180916.J0158+65, was found by CHIME to exhibit a 16.35-day periodicity in its repetition activity (The CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020) . There is now also a claim that the first source found to repeat, FRB 121102, does so with a tentative \u223c 160 day periodicity in its activity level (Rajwade et al. 2020) . No FRB periodicity has been detected on timescales between 10 \u22123 s and 10 3 s that might be associated with a neutron star rotation period.",

They have found that repeaters typically emit longer-duration pulses, and once-off FRBs are narrower (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c; Fonseca et al. 2020) . This has been shown for the first 12 published apparent non-repeaters (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a) and 18 repeating FRBs discovered by CHIME. It was also suggested by Scholz et al. (2016) , who noticed that the nonrepeating FRBs detected at Parkes were shorter in duration than FRB 121102. Robust comparison across different surveys is difficult, but the CHIME FRBs were all found on the same telescope by the same pipeline, and it is difficult to explain the width/repetition relation with an instrumental selection effect.",

FRB repetition is often clustered and not described by a homogeneous Poisson process (Scholz et al. 2016; Oppermann et al. 2018; Gourdji et al. 2019) . This increases the variance on the number of detected bursts in an observing window, even if the mean remains the same, N exp = \u2126 j 4\u03c0 R j T obs . We have assumed a delta function distribution in DM with n i (DM) = \u03b4(DM \u2212 1000) when that is known to not be the case. We have also used a perfect mapping between \u2126 and pulse duration t i . Still, we have experimented with adding noise to the \u2126(t i ) function such that there is jitter in the mapping, and find that so long as there is a correlation between beaming angle and duration, there is a difference between the detectable widths of repeaters vs. apparent non-repeaters. We also tested different distributions in \u2126 and DM and recover the same effect as long as the two main assumptions in Sect. 2 are met. Finally, the pulse widths reported by CHIME are fitted widths rather than the maximum-S/N boxcar that was used to discover the FRB (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a,c; Fonseca et al. 2020) . They are able to do this effectively because of their large fractional bandwidth, which can dis- The black and orange counts are FRBs that were 'observable' once and more than once, respectively, thanks to their favourable viewing angle and their being within the temporal observing window.

Therefore, we do not expect a bimodal distribution of FRB widths in which repeaters have a characteristic duration and non-repeaters have a different one. This is in contrast to GRBs, which can be divided into two classes along burst duration, where short-hard bursts are typically less than 2 s and long-soft bursts are longer than 2 s (Kouveliotou et al., 1993 ; see the review in Berger, 2014) . We also expect a positive correlation between FRB duration and repetition rate. The strength of this correlation will depend on the mapping between beaming angle and intrinsic pulse width, as well as observational selection effects. Again, this is because our population is not divided into repeaters and non-repeaters. That is, even within the set of detected repeaters, we expect those that repeat more frequently to have wider beams. From our simulation, we find that such a correlation persists so long as the \u2126/t relationship is not made too noisy and a large-enough collection of repeaters have been observed for more than an average repeat period. This is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3, where there is a discernible relationship for the large number of black points, but none for the first 19 detections in our simulation.",

The correlation was tested using a Pearson product-moment correlation, but was not found to be constraining either in the linear or in a logarithmic space. At this point, that is unsurprising for the following reasons. With just 19 repeaters observed for a median \u223c 23 hours, many sources have only repeated two or three times. This combined with the uncertainty of CHIME's exposure to each source (from unknown beam shapes, dayto-day sensitivity, etc.), leads to large uncertainties in their repeat rate, which we take as R j CHIME = N j /T j obs . Furthermore, the inferred repeat rate of sources that have been detected just a few times is highly biased. Suppose there were 1000 FRBs all with the same intrinsic Poissonian repeat rate, and they were observed for a duration less than their common repeat period. The first dozen repeater detections would necessarily have a much higher inferred repeat rate than their underlying repetition frequency. Therefore, we should expect the CHIME repeaters that have been detected fewer than 5 times to repeat less frequently in the future than they have thus far. Finally, as discussed in Sect. 2, temporally clustered, non-Poissonian repetition increases the error bars on the number of bursts detected in an observing window, furthering uncertainty in repeat rate. The Poissonian error bars we use for the red points in Fig. 3 are therefore lower limits on the true uncertainty.",

The black points in the bottom panel of Fig. 3 give an idea of the broader trend and the number of repeaters required to measure this correlation. In our simulation (and similarly with CHIME), the repeaters have only been observed for 20-30 hours, so there is a floor in the repeat rate at 2 per 30 hours. That floor can be seen in the plot's black points.

Our model requires that FRBs are differentially beamed and that their opening angle scales with pulse width. It also requires that repeat bursts from the same source point in different directions over a larger area than its own beaming solid angle \u2126. While we do not attempt to explain this phenomenon at the emission level with high certainty, below we provide examples of how the \u2126/t relationship could emerge in the context of previously-proposed FRB models.",

Therefore old, non-recycled pulsars with large periods have smaller opening angles. It has been proposed that one reason old pulsars become unobservable is not just that they become too faint as they approach the death line, but that their narrow beams are less likely to point in the direction of the observer as their magnetic and spin axes become more aligned (Johnston & Karastergiou 2017) . That scenario is similar to the selection effect we have described in this paper except that in the case of pulsars, older sources have spun down so much that their pulse durations are wider, despite having narrower opening angles. If FRBs are produced by a rotating, pulsar-like object (Cordes & Wasserman 2016; Kumar et al. 2017 ), then we require wide opening angles to correspond to long duration bursts, so W and P should not anti-correlate in the same way as Galactic pulsars. Within this framework, our model would also require that each repeat burst is emitted sporadically at a range of pulse phases, since periodicity has not been seen in repeating FRBs on short timescales (10 \u22123 -10 3 s).",

In this 'wandering narrow beam' model, the burst duration depends on both opening angle and the angular speed at which the beam drifts past the line of sight. As long as the distribution of angular speeds does not dominate the observed pulse width, such a scenario would lead to frequent repeaters being longer duration than once-off FRBs, due to our proposed selection effect.",

Therefore, FRB emission models that invoke significant beaming must offer a way of producing 4\u03c0 \u2126 times more bursts.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) (Law et al. 2018 ) could follow up wide single-detection FRBs found by CHIME, assuming that width is not dominated by scattering or instrumental smearing. For example, FRB 121102 has only been detected once by CHIME and the one detection was very broad, at 34 ms (Josephy et al. 2019) . If that source were not already known to be a repeater, FRB 121102 would have been an obvious candidate to follow up based only on the width criteria. As CHIME observed between 400 and 800 MHz, higher-frequency coverage could offer interesting insights into frequency dependence of pulse width and repetition activity. There appears to be a width/frequency relation in FRB 121102, with a shorter timescale at higher frequencies (Gajjar et al. 2018) .

Therefore, if there exists a population of narrow FRBs that are currently being missed due to instrumental smearing (Connor 2019) , surveys that hope to detect a large number of distant sources for FRB applications must mitigate these effects in their telescope back-end to go after sub-millisecond events.

We use two intrinsic repeat rates, R (solid) and 10 R (dashed), corresponding to an expected value of 5 and 50 bursts per T obs , respectively. The right panel shows the observable pulse width distributions of repeaters and apparent non-repeaters, having converted beaming solid angle \u2126 to pulse width, t, via Eq. 6. There are more broad-duration repeating FRBs, and narrower single detections.",
