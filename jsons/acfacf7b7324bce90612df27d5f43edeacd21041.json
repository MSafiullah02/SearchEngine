            "text": "We have recently shown that activation of CAR, a potent transcription factor in the nuclear receptor family, reduces liver cell apoptosis and injury in a murine model, following administration of Jo2 (a Fas agonistic antibody). However, whether Con A liver injury is reduced by CAR activation remains unknown. Thus, our aim was to ascertain if the CAR agonist ligand TCPOBOP attenuates acute and chronic Con A-induced liver injury. Methods: Acute liver injury: C57/BL6 CAR wild type (CAR \u03e9/\u03e9 ) and knock out mice (CAR -/-) were injected i.p. (3mg/kg) daily with the CAR agonist TCPOBOP or vehicle (corn oil) for 3 days. Next, mice were injected with Con A 25 mg/kg i.v. and liver injury (H&E, and serum ALT determinations) was assessed 15 hrs later. Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence for activated caspase 3/7. Chronic liver injury: Mice were injected with TCPOBOP or vehicle (corn oil) i.p. weekly followed by weekly Con A i.v. injections 8 mg/kg or vehicle for 6 weeks. Liver fibrosis was assessed in sirius red stained liver sections and \u2423SMA mRNA expression by RT-PCR, respectively. Results: Acute injury: Following Con A administration, serum ALT values were elevated 120-fold in CAR \u03e9/\u03e9 vehicle and CAR -/animals vs. TCPOBOP treated CAR \u03e9/\u03e9 animals. TUNEL positive cells and caspase 3/7 immunofluorescence was also elevated in CAR \u03e9/\u03e9 vehicle and CAR -/animals, but not TCPOBOP-treated mice after Con A administration. Chronic injury: \u2423SMA mRNA expression was decreased by approximately 50% in TCPOBOP treated CAR \u03e9/ \u03e9animals compared to vehicle. Sirius red staining showed marked fibrosis in liver sections from animals without TCPOBOP pretreatment. In Conclusion, these original findings support a prominent role for CAR cytoprotection against Con A mediated acute and chronic liver injury. CAR agonists may represent a novel approach for reducing liver injury and fibrosis in immune mediated liver diseases.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that Bid, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, plays an important role in TNF-\u2423 and anti-Fas antibody induced apoptosis in primary cultured murine hepatocytes. However, the bid-deficient hepatocytes eventually died after 24hrs although the process delayed by 6hrs compared to wild type cells after TNF-\u2423 treatment. This suggests that a Bid-independent pathway may contribute to the cell death after TNF-\u2423 treatment. In the present study, we found that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was lower at the early time point but increased significantly at later time points after TNF-\u2423 treatment in bid-deficient cells. Moreover, MnTBAP, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, significantly inhibited the cell death in both wild type and biddeficient cells, suggesting that ROS may be involved in the Bidindependent pathway. Bax, another pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, can translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondria to induce mitochondrial apoptotic factors release. Indeed, using three different approaches, GFP-tagging, immunostaining and Western blot, we observed Bax translocation following TNF-\u2423 treatment in both wild type and bid-deficient hepatocytes. We further found that ROS could also mediate TNF-\u2423-induced c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Interestingly, the antioxidant MnTBAP, the mitochondria permeability transition pore inhibitor, cyclosporine A, and the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, all can inhibit Bax translocation, cytochrome c release and the subsequent caspase activation and apoptosis in both wild type and bid-deficient hepatocytes. All the above evidence suggests that ROS may play a critical role in regulation of Bax translocation and the subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis even in the absence of Bid in hepatocytes. The understanding of the role of ROS in the death-receptor activation induced liver injury thus may help to develop new strategies to alleviate such liver injury by using antioxidants.",

            "text": "In HCC, however, its direct cytotoxic activity is still controversial, and indeed, most hepatoma cell lines are resistant to IFN-mediated apoptosis in vitro. In this sense, some combination agents may be needed to overcome IFN resistance. At DDW 2005, we reported the combined anticancer effect of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, NS-398, and IFN-\u2424 on human hepatoma cell lines. Recently it was reported that IFN induced apoptosis through up-regulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) even in solid tumor cells. In this study, we aimed to clarify the precise mechanism of the combined anticancer effect through TRAIL-mediated pathway and the different potential of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 to synergy with a COX-2 inhibitor. Methods: Three human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, PLC/PRF5, and HuH7) were employed. The growth inhibitory effect was evaluated by MTS assay. Apoptosis was observed by using DAPI and fluorescent microscopy. Caspase activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit. Expression of apoptosis-inducing molecules such as TRAIL, death receptor (DR) 4, and DR5 was evaluated by Western blotting and realtime PCR technique. Results: Only a minimal growth inhibition was observed by a single treatment with IFN in three hepatoma cell lines. In contrast, combination treatment with NS-398 and IFN-\u2424 effectively inhibited the proliferation in a dose and time-dependent manner. These cytotoxic effects were recognized as apoptosis by DAPI staining. IFN-\u2423 showed almost same effect as IFN-\u2424 when administered alone, while the combined effect with NS-398 was much lower than that of IFN-\u2424. Treatment with IFN-\u2424 up-regulated both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of TRAIL in all of the hepatoma cell lines, while the increase by IFN-\u2423 was faint. This difference might contribute to the stronger anticancer effect by IFN-\u2424 and NS-398. Treatment with NS-398 up-regulated the level of DR5, and TRAIL expression was unchanged. Consequently, the combination treatment upregulated the expression of both TRAIL and DR5, and the activity of caspase-8 and -3 was dramatically enhanced. We confirmed the contribution of TRAIL to the antiproliferative effect by using neutralizing antibody against TRAIL. In HepG2, treatment with IFN-\u2424/NS-398 reduced the cell viability to 38.4% at 48 hours, and administration of TRAIL neutralizing antibody recovered the cell viability to 67.0%. In Conclusion, we demonstrated that IFN-\u2424 and NS-398 synergistically induce cell death through TRAIL /TRAIL receptors-mediated apoptotic pathway in human hepatoma cell lines.",

            "text": "The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Nobuhiro Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) inhibits classical mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis either by directly stabilizing mitochondrial membranes or modulating specific upstream targets. Furthermore, UDCA regulates apoptosis-related genes from transforming growth factor \u24241 (TGF-\u24241)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by a nuclear steroid receptor (NSR)-dependent mechanism. In this study, we further investigated the potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the anti-apoptotic function of UDCA. Our results with short interference RNA (siRNA) technology confirmed that UDCA significantly reduces TGF-\u24241-induced apoptosis of primary rat hepatocytes through a GR-dependent effect. Immunoprecipitation assays and confocal microscopy showed that UDCA increases free GR levels with subsequent GR nuclear translocation. Interestingly, when a carboxy-terminus deleted form of GR was used, UDCA no longer induced GR/hsp90 dissociation and/or GR translocation nor protected against TGF-\u24241induced apoptosis. In cotransfection experiments with GR response element reporter and overexpression constructs, UDCA reduced the transactivation of GR with TGF-\u24241. Finally, using a flourescently-labeled UDCA molecule, the bile acid appeared diffuse in the cytosol but was aggregated in the nucleus of hepatocytes. Interestingly, both siRNA experiments and transfections with the carboxy-terminus deleted form of GR showed that nuclear trafficking of UDCA occurs through a GR-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, these results further clarify the antiapoptotic mechanism(s) of UDCA, and suggest that GR is crucial for the nuclear translocation of this bile acid for attenuating apoptosis.

            "text": "The hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor c-met support a pleiotrophic signal transduction pathway that controls regulation of cell survival. Previously, we have shown that mice lacking c-met in hepatocytes were hypersensitive to Fas-induced liver injury and died from fulminant hepatic failure after treatment with Jo-2 mAb that did not affect survival of wild-type mice. In the present study, we used primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from c-Met-deficient (MetLivKO) and Alb-Cre control (AlbCre-Ctrl) mice to examine the mechanisms of hepatoprotective effects of HGF. Hepatocytes were treated with 0.5 ug/ml of Jo-2 mAb either alone or after pretreatment with rhHGF (40 ng/ml) for different time periods. MetLivKO primary hepatocytes showed reduced survival in culture and were more sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis verified by PI staining as well as cleavage of caspase 3 and cytochrome C realease. HGF pretreatment diminished Jo-2-induced apoptosis in AlbCre-Ctrl but not in MetLivKO cells. Similarly, phosphorylation of AKT, Erk1/2, and STAT3 was detected within the first hour of HGF treatment only in AlbCre-Ctrl cells. HGF protection against apoptosis was time dependent and peaked after 6-12 h of HGF exposure. In addition, AlbCre-hepatocytes treated with HGF showed a time dependent induction of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. We next examined the status of NF-kB. EMSA assay showed an increase in NF-kB activation in HGF treated AlbCre-Ctrl cells when compared with MetLivKO hepatocytes, moreover, the activation of NF-kB correlated with degradation of the IkB-\u2423 in cells treated with HGF. In order to assess the involvement of Akt, Erk1/2 and STAT3 in NF-kB activation, we pretreated the AlbCre-Ctrl hepatocytes with PI3K inhibitor worthmaninn, AKT inhibitor LY294002, MAPK inhibitor PD98059, and a peptide inhibitor of STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K and AKT abolished NF-kB activation and the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF, and was correlated with a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Inhibition of STAT3 and ERK 1/2 was less effective in protection against Jo2-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that HGF/ c-Met signaling pathway protects hepatocytes from Fas-mediated apoptosis via the AKT pathway and NF-kB activation.",

            "text": "Background: In acute liver failure, hepatocytes are exposed to various cytokines that activate both cell survival and apoptotic pathways. NF-kB is a central transcription factor in these responses. In inflammatory conditions, hepatocyte survival is dependent on NF-kB activation. Blocking NF-kB causes apoptosis, suggesting the existence of NF-kB regulated anti-apoptotic genes. The Bcl-2 protein family is critical in regulating cell death. This family consists of pro-and anti-apoptotic members, which together regulate the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. Previously, we have demonstrated the cytokine-inducible, NF-kBdependent expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member A1 (Bfl-1) in hepatocytes. In principle, A1 is a candidate for gene therapy of liver disorders characterized by mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis. Aim: To investigate whether overexpression of A1 protects hepatocytes against apoptosis. Methods: Full length rat A1 was prepared by high-fidelity PCR and correct sequence of the rat A1 cDNA was verified (Genbank sequence AF-378332). The full-length A1 cDNA was cloned into a pCR\u00ae-Blunt II-TOPO\u00ae-plasmid. An A1 expressing recombinant adenovirus (AdA1) was constructed using the AdEasy system. Bile acid sensitive HepG2.ntcp cells were exposed to the pro-apoptotic bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA: 100 M) or TNFa (20 ng/ml) in combination with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (200 ng/ml). HepG2.ntcp cells were infected 48 hours before addition of test substances with AdA1 and AdLacZ at a MOI of 10. Adenovirus containing the lacZ gene (AdLacZ) was used as a control virus. Expression of A1 in HepG2.ntcp cells was determined by RT-PCR. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase-3 activity. Results: (1) A1 full length cDNA was prepared, sequenced and a recombinant adenovirus expressing A1 (AdA1) was succesfully constructed.",

            "text": "Background: Metformin is a drug used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. In this disease, metformin improves the glucose tolerance. Furthermore, metformin treatment reduces liver injury in an experimental mouse model of non-alcoholic-fatty-liver disease (NAFLD), and in patients with NAFLD Thus, metformin is a hepatoprotective drug. The hepatoprotective mechanism of metformin has not been elucidated yet. Metformin is presumed to activate the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a cellular energy sensor that is activated in conditions that increase the AMP:ATP ratio. The AMP:ATP ratio is important in regulating apoptosis. Therefore, metformin could modulate apoptosis of hepatocytes in chronic liver diseases. Aim of the present study was to examine whether metformin is hepatoprotective via inhibition of apoptosis. Methods: Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to the pro-apoptotic bile acid glychochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA: 50 M) for 4 hrs or TNFa/Actinomycin D for 6 hrs to induce apoptosis. Metformin (0.1-2 mM) was added simultaneously. AMPK was inhibited using iodotubercidin (0.1-10 m), and the AMPKdownstream target mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) was inhibited using rapamycin (50-500 nM). Caspase-3 activation was measured with a fluorometric assay. Necrotic cell death was detected using the Sytox Green nuclear staining. Results: Both GCDCA and TNFa/ActD induced caspase-3 activation was dose-dependently reduced by metformin (25% at 0.1mM, 58% at 0.5mM; 80% at 1mM). Furthermore, the anti-apoptic effect of metformin did not result in necrosis. Neither the AMPK-inhibitor iodotubercidin nor the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had any effect on the protective effect of metformin on GCDCA induced caspase-3 activity. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a completely novel antiapoptotic action of metformin. Metformin protects against various forms of apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes. However, this protective effect is independent of AMPK or mTOR, suggesting the involvement of alternative mechanisms. Furthermore, our results suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of metformin in NAFLD, studied in animal models, could be based on reduction of apoptosis. In addition, metformin could be an important treatment in liver diseases in which apoptosis plays a major role.",

All together, our results clearly indicate that the HCV core protein interferes with PML function: it colocalises with PML in NBs, interacts physically with this tumor suppressor protein and inhibits its apoptosis-inducing activity by interfering with PML-associated modulation of p53.

Previously, we showed that anti-apoptotic XIAP (Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) decreases progressively during ischemia to cultured hepatocytes, an effect associated with increased apoptosis after reperfusion (Kim et al., Gastroenterology 2005; 128 Suppl. 2:A-708). Here, our Aim was to assess apoptosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion in hepatocytes isolated from XIAP deficient mice and after infection with an XIAP-expressing adenovirus. Methods: Cultured mouse hepatocytes were incubated in anoxic Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer at pH 6.2 for 0.5-3 h to simulate tissue ischemia. To simulate reperfusion, hepatocytes were reoxygenated in hormonally defined medium at pH 7.4 for 8 h with fructose and glycine to prevent necrosis. At various times, cell lysates was prepared from hepatocytes and Western blot analysis was carried out. To assess apoptosis, caspase 3 activation and morphological changes in nuclei were evaluated, respectively, by FAM-DEVD-fmk, a fluorochrome inhibitor of caspase 3 (FLICA), and propidium iodide staining. To further investigate the role of XIAP, apoptosis after 8 h of reperfusion was determined in hepatocytes isolated from XIAP-KO mice. In some experiments, XIAO-deficient hepatocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding XIAP and then subjected to ischemia/reperfusion in the presence or absence of 2 M cyclosporin A (CsA), an MPT blocker. Results: XIAP levels progressively decreased to 41% and 12% of normoxic levels after 1 h and 3 h of ischemia to wild type hepatocytes and did not recover during reperfusion. In wild-type hepatocytes, caspase activation after reperfusion increased from 3.8% to 29.2% when ischemia was extended from 30 min to 3 h. However, in XIAP-deficient hepatocytes, 40.4% of cells showed activation of caspase 3 even after 30 min of ischemia, a greater than 10-fold enhancement of apoptosis compared to wild type. After 3 h of ischemia, 61.7% of XIAP-deficient cells were FLICApositive. Evaluation of nuclear morphology with propidium iodide confirmed substantial apoptosis in XIAP-deficient cells. Pretreatment with an XIAP-expressing adenovirus, but not a LacZ-expressing adenovirus, and reperfusion with CsA markedly suppressed caspase 3 activation in hepatocytes from XIAP-deficient mice after short periods of ischemia. Conclusion: Decreases of the anti-apoptotic protein, XIAP, sensitize hepatocytes to MPTdependent apoptosis after reperfusion.

            "text": "The accumulation of toxic bile acids within the hepatocyte is a primary factor in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury. Mitochondrial (mito) pathways involved in cell death have been implicated in this process, including induction of the mito permeability transition (MPT), generation of reactive oxygen species, reduced ATP production and release of pro-apoptotic pro-teins such as cytochrome c. The role of these mito pathways in neonatal liver injury has not been evaluated. This is important because the neonate is particularly susceptible to cholestatic injury which is associated with predominantly necrotic rather than apoptotic hepatocyte death. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that there are developmental differences in mito pathways of hepatocyte cell death. Methods: Hepatic mitos were isolated by differential centrifugation from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, or pooled livers from 6, 10,21 and 36 day old male rats. Electron microscopy was performed on glutaraldehydefixed mitos, and content of specific proteins relevant to the MPT were analyzed by immunoblotting. To quantitated bile acid-induced MPT, mito swelling was measured by absorbance at 540 nm during 5 minutes exposure of succinate-energized mitos to graded concentrations (0-500M) of glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) and expressed as \u232cOD/5 min. After the MPT experiment, remaining mito cytochrome c content was determined. Results: At a concentration of 50M GCDC, adult rat liver mitos underwent an extensive MPT (\u232cOD\u03ed0.56\u03ee0.01) when compared with neonatal mitos (\u232cOD\u03ed0.06\u03ee0.02, 0.08\u03ee0.04, 0.12\u03ee0.01, and 0.20\u03ee0.05 for 6, 10, 21 and 36 day old rats, respectively). Similar patterns of agerelated induction of MPT were observed for GCDC at 25-500M. MPT was inhibited by cyclosporine A (\u054698%) in rats of all ages, implying an intact cyclophilin pathway. GCDC-induced release of mito cytochrome c paralleled the extent of MPT. Basal mito levels of MPT pore proteins, VDAC and ANT, were similar in all ages of rats, whereas cytochrome c and BCL-XL increased with age. Ultrastructure of hepatic mitos revealed similar size and morphology at all ages. Conclusions: Neonatal rat liver mitos are relatively resistant to bile acid induced MPT, undergoing an MPT only at high GCDC concentrations. Mito morphology and levels of ANT, VDAC, BCL-XL, and cytochrome C do not explain this finding. Thus the neonate is protected against bile acid induced hepatocyte injury by an as yet unknown mechanism inhibiting the MPT.

However, the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway is a well-documented, alternative pro-survival or anti-apoptotic pathway that may alter TGF\u2424-induced Smad signaling and, thereby, affect apoptosis. Aims: The two-fold aims are: (1) To determine if the PI3-Kinase/ Akt pathway is up-regulated in cirrhotic hepatocytes, and, if so, whether inhibition influences apoptosis, and (2) To assess inhibition of the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway and related changes in the Smad signaling pathway. Methods: Cirrhosis was induced in BALB/c mice by twice-weekly injections of 50% CCl4 for 8 weeks. P-Akt expression in the cirrhotic liver was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots of liver lysates. Primary hepatocytes were pre-treated with the PI3-Kinase inhibitor, LY294002, prior to TGF\u2424 administration. Immunoblots for total Smad2 and 3, p-Smad2 and 3, total Akt, and p-Akt were performed. Apoptosis was determined morphologically by Hoescht stain and biochemically by fluorescent caspase-3 activity. Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that p-Akt was consistently up-regulated in cirrhotic, but not in normal, livers. These findings were confirmed by immunoblots that uniformily demonstrated increased p-Akt expression in cirrhotic liver lysates. TGF\u2424 treatment (5 ng/ml) induced p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and p-Akt in both normal and cirrhotic hepatocytes. P-Akt expression in normal and cirrhotic hepatocytes was independent of insulin concentration in the medium. Pretreatment of hepatocytes for 1 hour with LY294002 inhibited TGF\u2424-stimulated p-Akt expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in cirrhotic hepatocytes only, PI3-Kinase inhibition decreased Smad2 signaling at 6 hours. HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 42, No. 4, Suppl. 1, 2005 AASLD ABSTRACTS 501A Total Smad2 and Smad3 expression were unaffected. Additionally, treatment of cirrhotic hepatocytes with 25 M LY294002 alone resulted in increased apoptosis and caspase-3 activity which was further enhanced by the addition of TGF\u2424. Conclusion: The PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway is up-regulated in cirrhotic mouse liver. Inhibition of this pathway in unstimulated cirrhotic hepatocytes increases apoptosis suggesting that PI3-Kinase/Akt has an insulin-independent pro-survival effect. Furthermore, PI3-Kinase/Akt inhibition in cirrhotic hepatocytes enhanced TGF\u2424-induced apoptosis despite decreased p-Smad2 expression implying that PI3-Kinase also has an anti-apoptotic effect and that TGF\u2424-induced apoptosis may occur through a non-Smad2-dependent pathway in cirrhotic hepatocytes. Background: Na accumulates in hepatocytes during hypoxic and toxic cell injury, and low Na medium decreases cell killing (Carini et al., BBRC 1995; 206: 180-1852). The mechanisms of protection may be prevention of uncontrolled osmotic swelling or inhibition of intracellular alkalinization by Na/H exchange. Accordingly, the AIM of this study was to characterize the role of Na, pH and cellular swelling in the pathogenesis of hypoxic injury to isolated perfused rat livers. Methods and Results: When livers were perfused with hypoxic Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) containing 143 mM Na, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release began after 30 min and was maximal after 60 min. In livers perfused with choline-substituted low Na (25 mM) KHB, LDH release was delayed and began after 60 min and peaked after 120 min or longer. Trypan blue nuclear labeling confirmed protection by low Na KHB. Mannitol (150 mM), a permeant sugar with antioxidant properties, suppressed LDH release, whereas equimolar sucrose, an impermeant disaccharide, did not protect. At the end of hypoxia with KHB and low Na KHB, liver weight was not different indicating no difference in swelling, whereas mannitol but not sucrose treatment increased liver weight after hypoxia. At pH 7.4, monensin (0.2-5 M)",

Results: Patients chronically infected with hepatitis virus show high serum concentrations of EGF and HGF. In contrast healthy controls contain significantly lower serum levels of these growth factors. Sensitivity of PHH cultures against CD95-dependant apoptosis was reduced by a combined exposure to EGF and HGF. The analysed signal cascades in PHH where characterized by a reduced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. After short term EGF/HGF-exposure we observed activation of Akt-kinase and Stat3. EGF and HGF promoted adhesion to collagen and an apoptosis resistant phenotype. The enhanced adhesion could be attributed to beta-integrin induction by HGF and EGF. The new cellular phenotype paralleled both beta-1-Integrin expression and accumulation of focal adhesions. Discussion: Compensatory regeneration programs of the liver are induced during viral infections and protect against apoptotic cell elimination. Inhibition of apoptosis contributes to the survival of infected host cells and therefore indicates a mechanism of viral immune evasion. Moreover, persisting changes of the cellular matrix, which are associated with hepatocyte regeneration or rescue, might be part of sequential events responsible for malignant cell transformation during chronic hepatitis.",

            "text": "Background: FXR (NR1H4) is a member of the group I nuclear receptor superfamily. Two major forms of FXR,a and b, have been identified in mammals that share significant sequence identity, especially in the DNA binding domain (DBD). The a form, which is activated by bile acids (CDCA), regulates key genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport. However, the b form in mouse is not activated by CDCA, but rather by lanosterol, a precursor of cholesterol. The structure/function relationship of the ligand binding domain (LBD) and its promiscuous ligand specificity are still unknown. Aim: To further elucidate the receptor/ligand structure relationship of FXR by identifying and characterizing an evolutionarily primitive Fxr from the marine skate, Leucoraja erinacea, whose predominate bile salt is scymnol sulfate, a sulfated bile alcohol. Methods: PCR, 5' and 3' RACEs were used to identify the skate Fxr (sFxr) gene. A Dual-luciferase assay was applied for functional characterization by co-transfecting sFxr with the human ileal bile acid binding protein (hI-BABP) promoter in a pGL3-basic vector into HEK293 cells. In parallel, human FXRa (hFXRa) was also tested and compared with sFxr. Results: The full length sFxr gene encodes for 518 amino acids. Sequence alignment shows that sFxr shares overall 57% identity to hFXRa, but 60% and 91% identity in the LBD and DBD, respectively. sFxr shows overall 52% identity to mouse Fxrb, but 53% and 92% identity in the LBD and DBD, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis places sFxr between a and b forms of FXR. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that sFxr activates hI-BABP promoter 30 times over vector control, indicating that the DBD of sFxr can bind to the IR-1 response element in the hI-BABP gene. Addition of 9-cis retinoic acid stimulates sFxr activity further, suggesting that sFxr forms a heterodimer with human RXR to activate this promoter. Both CDCA and scymnol sulfate activate hFXRa and sFxr in a dose dependent manner, but to a much lesser extent for sFxr than hFXRa. Lanosterol failed to stimulate either sFxr or hFXRa.",

Many components, including cytoskeletal elements and motor molecules, are proposed to participate in canalicular biogenesis; however, their specific requirement is unknown. Two distinct routes are utilized for delivery of membrane proteins to the canaliculus. Proteins having GPI anchors or single transmembrane domains are targeted to the sinusoidal plasma membrane from where they transcytose to the canalicular domain (1, 2). In contrast, canalicular ATP-binding-casette (ABC) transporters, which are required for energy-dependent biliary secretion of bile acids (ABCB11), phospholipids (ABCB4) and nonbile acid organic anions (ABCC2), lack initial residence in the sinusoidal plasma membrane and traffic directly from Golgi to the canalicular membrane (3, 4). While investigating mechanisms of canalicular targeting in WIF-B9 cells, a polarized hepatic cell line (5), we observed that rab11a and myosin Vb are required for canalicular biogenesis. Depleting rab11a by RNA interference or overexpression of rab11a dominant negative form prevented canalicular formation. Overexpression of myosin vb motorless tail domain that acts as dominant negative inhibitor of rab11a positive endosome sorting also prevented canalicular formation. In exploring the basis for these effects, we observed distribution of canalicular ABC transporters. Prior to canalicular formation, canalicular ABC transporters colocalized with transcytotic membrane proteins in rab11a positive endosomes and, unlike the transcytotic membrane proteins, did not distribute to the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Mammalian hepatic cytochromes P450 (P450s) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored hemoproteins engaged in the metabolism of numerous xeno-and endobiotics. P450s constitute 5-10% of the ER content, exhibit widely ranging half-lives, and utilize both lysosomal and ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteasomal (Ub/ 26S) pathways for degradation. Although the degradation of suicidally inactivated CYPs 3A in isolated hepatocytes and of \"native\" CYP3A4 in S. cerevisiae occurs via the Ub/26S pathway, the physiological turnover mechanism of hepatic CYPs 3A in their native form has not yet been elucidated, largely because of a lack of a suitable experimental model. Herein, we characterize the degradation of native CYPs 3A in cultured rat hepatocytes, seeded on type I collagen coated plates and overlaid with Matrigel. CYPs 3A were induced by dexamethasone (5 mM) treatment. To examine the specific route of CYP3A degradation in these cultured hepatocytes, proteasomal (MG-132 and MG-262) and lysosomal [NH4Cl and 3-methyladenine (3-MA)] inhibitors were used. Pulse-chase analyses followed by 35S-CYP3A protein immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed a basal 52% loss of 35S-CYP3A, which was stabilized by the inclusion of proteasomal inhibitors MG-262 and MG-132 (35S-CYP3A levels of 91 \u03ee 35% and 76 \u03ee 22%, respectively). By contrast, no corresponding stabilization of CYP3A was detected with either lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl (52 \u03ee 12%) or 3-MA (50 \u03ee 10%). Furthermore, this MG-262-induced CYP3A stabilization was associated with a high molecular weight CYP3A protein ladder extending between 55-200 kDa indicative of CYP3A polyubiquination, which was indeed confirmed by immunoblotting (IB) analyses of CYP3A immunoprecipitates with anti-Ub IgGs. These studies thus verified that native CYPs 3A were also degraded by the Ub/26S pathway. To identify the other cellular participants involved in this pathway, cross-linking experiments were performed with paraformaldehyde (PFA). Similar IB analyses of CYP3A immunoprecipitates after PFA-cross-linking revealed the presence of p97, a cytosolic AAA ATPase instrumental in the delivery of ubiquitinated ER proteins for proteasome degradation. p97-CYP3A interactions was increased following suicidal inactivation of CYP3A, an event known to accelerate the Ub/26S degradation of hepatic CYPs 3A. Preliminary proteomic analyses confirmed these results. These findings thus reveal that in common with the suicidally inactivated species and CYP3A4 in yeast, native CYPs 3A also undergo Ub/26S proteasomal degradation and for the first time implicate a role for p97 in this process. Background and Aims: We previously reported that endothelin (ET)-1 may be involved in the contraction of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (SEF). Rho has emerged as an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and consequently cell morphology. To clarify the role of endothelin receptors in ET-1 induced contraction of SEF, we studied the size of hepatic SEF under various experimental conditions. Methods: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) isolated from rat livers by collagenase infusion method were cultured and divided into five groups: control, ET-1 (10-7 to 10-10 M)-treated, ET-1 \u03e9 selective ET-A receptor antagonist (BQ610)-treated, ET-1 \u03e9 ET-B receptor antagonist (BQ788)treated, and ET-1 \u03e9 Bosentan-treated groups. SEF morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. F-actin stress fiber formation was observed by confocal microscopy. Rho A and phosphorylated myosin light chain kinase were analyzed by Western blotting. Active Rho was measured by Ren's modification. Intracellular free Ca2\u03e9 concentration ([Ca2\u03e9]i) was measured by fluorescence digital imaging using fura-2 AM by Aqua Cosmos (Hamamastu). Each experiment was based on the observation of 600 fenestrae (15 to 20 fenestrae per cell, 20 cells per dish, 10 dishes). We also investigated the ET receptors in SECs by confocal fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Results: Endothelin B receptor (ETBR) antagonist and Bosentan pretreatment abolished SEF contraction induced by low ET-1 concentrations (10\u1b80|8 to10\u1b80|10 M), whereas endothelin A receptor (ETAR) antagonist pretreatment did not block SEF contraction at low to high endothelin concentrations (10\u1b80|5 to10\u1b80|10 M). F-actin stress fibers and Rho A levels were similar in control and various treatment conditions. Phosphorylated myosin light chain kinase levels remained the same in various treatments. Active Rho was not detected in control and various treatments. ET treatment led to an increase in[Ca2\u03e9]I after 20 min. ET-1-induced increase in [Ca2\u03e9]i was partially blocked by BQ610 and Bosentan, but not by BQ788. Confocal microscopy depicted prominent ETBR-positive aggregates in the cytoplasmic periphery of SECs. Western blot showed prominent ETBR but scarce ETAR protein expression in SECs.",

A cDNA arrays analysis of gene expression profiles of cirrhotic tissues, macronodules and HCCs pointed us to focus on Klf6, a zinc finger transcription factor. We observed that Klf6 mRNA expression was up-regulated in HCCs as compared to macronodules. Inactivating mutations of this gene (exon 2) have been reported in many human solid tumors by other authors. Klf6 is thus described as a potential tumor suppressor gene in epithelial carcinomas. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of Klf6 in the proliferation of human hepatic cancer cells. Methods: Human hepatic cancer HepG2 cell line was examined for expression of endogenous Klf6 by PCR, immunofluorescence and Western Blot. Sequencing of exon 2 was performed in order to search mutations. The inhibition of Klf6 expression in HepG2 cells was performed with the highly specific RNA interference method. Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting, and cell cycle analysis was performed by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting with propidium iodide staining. Study of p21/WAF1 expression at protein level was done by Western blot analysis. Results: We observed that Klf6 was expressed in HepG2 cells. No mutation was detected within the exon 2 of Klf6 gene. Using RNA interference, Klf6 expression was significantly inhibited with a 75 % reduction of Klf6 protein level. RNAi-mediated Klf6 silencing induced a 53% inhibition of HepG2 cells proliferation. The silencing of Klf6 induced an increase of p21(WAF1) expression and a cell cycle arrest. Conclusion: Klf6 is expressed and not mutated in HepG2 cells. Klf6 plays a critical role in positive regulation of cell growth in vitro. Thus, over-expression of Klf6 may contribute to HCC progression.

To address the question of which genes are influenced in hepatocytes in response to Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) gel, a model of the basement membrane matrix, we used cDNA microarray and studied the relationship with cytoskeleton and cell differentiation. Methods: Isolated rat hepatocytes were cultured on type I collagen or EHS gel. The fluorescently labeled cDNA was applied to a microarray glass containing 3,757 supplied clones and hybridized. Changes in mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blot. Hepatocytes were stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. Results: When hepatocytes were cultured on EHS gels, they retained the normal cell polarity and structure, and maintained liver-specific gene transcript compared with hepatocytes on type I collagen. By cDNA microarray, genes involved in cell signaling and metabolism were induced by EHS gel, and genes involved in gene/protein expression and cell structure were suppressed by EHS gel. We focused on 21 genes in cell signaling and 6 down-regulated genes in cell structure. After careful examination of the 27 genes, we found two important genes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) phosphatase and cofilin, which are respectively associated with actin polymerization and depolymerization. Using Northern blot analysis, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) 5-kinase mRNA, by which PI(4)P is converted to PI(4,5)P2, was decreased by EHS gel, indicating that EHS gel could affect the level of PI(4,5)P2 in cultured hepatocytes. In fact, hepatocytes cultured on EHS gel exhibited a decreased level of PI(4,5)P2 staining. The level of intracellular actin filament (F-actin) was totally suppressed in hepatocytes cultured on EHS gel, but not in hepatocytes cultured on type I collagen. After the treatment with PI(4,5)P2, F-actin increased and albumin mRNA decreased in hepatocytes on EHS gel. In contrast, the treatment with gelsolin that induces actin depolymerization had the level of F-actin suppressed and albumin mRNA increased in hepatocytes cultured on collagen. Conclusion: Our results showed that cell adhesion to the ECM induces changes in the assembly of actin filament through an actin-binding protein, PI(4,5)P2. These changes in cytoskeletal filament assembly that occur following cell attachment to the ECM and/or alterations in the pattern of actin-binding proteins played crucial roles in the determination of the differential phenotype of hepatocytes.",

The failure to meet these requirements has prevented the development of a reliable liver cell culture system. We have previously reported the benefits of restoring normal cell/cell interaction through co-culture of hepatocytes with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). This promotes the formation of viable spheroids that retain albumin production and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A function for up to 14 days at a higher level than with hepatocyte mono-culture alone. The aim of this study was to further evaluate this co-culture strategy and to determine the impact of mimicking normal cell/ matrix interactions by co-culturing on a micro-porous poly(DLlactic acid) scaffold. Methods: Primary rat hepatocytes and HSCs were co-cultured on a mono-layer of poly(DL-lactic acid) to form spheroids.

Co-culture was the only strategy to produce the CYP-3A metabolite at 14 days (P\u05450.01). Activated HSCs attached to the polymer scaffolds within 24 hours.

Objective: To further characterize this newly discovered sterol binding protein by determining its cellular/subcellular localization, cholesterol transport capabilities, and expression in different cell types. Methods: Western analysis and immunohisto/cytochemistry were performed to characterize StarD5's cellular localization. Increased intracellular expression of StarD5 was achieved using a recombinant adenovirus encoding human StarD5. Subcellular fractions were obtained to characterize the directional movement of cholesterol by StarD5. Results: Hepatocytes represent the equivalent of StarD5 knockout cells, lacking detectable StarD5 protein.

Markedly increased StarD5 levels were found within human hepatocellular carcinomas as compared to normal liver tissue. Immunocytochemistry placed this increased protein within CD68 (i.e. Kupffer-like) positive cells. StarD5 was not found in other tested human cells (i.e 1 o human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, brain tissue, or osteocytes). Immunocytochemistry of macrophages localized StarD5 intracellularly to intense Golgi staining with a more diffuse cytosolic pattern. Interestingly, cellular fractionation studies only showed the detection of StarD5 within the cytosolic fraction, suggesting a loose association of StarD5 with the Golgi membrane. Conclusions: The presence of StarD5, previously described as widely distributed, can be ascribed to its localization within inflammatory associated cells. Subcellular localization of StarD5 to the Golgi and cytoplasm, its selective binding of 25hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol, and the increase in free-cholesterol within microsomal fractions after expression in hepatocytes, led us to hypothesize StarD5 as a 'regulatory sterol' transporter within the cell; one with Golgi targeting. Furthermore, its presence within inflammatory cells and its selective sterol binding abilities, suggest an important role for StarD5 in cholesterol homeostais related with immune inflammatory associated processes (atherogenesis/cancer).",

            "text": "Increased rates of apoptosis have been reported to play a role in the pathophysiology of many disorders, including liver diseases. Conversely, genetic mutations which result in impairment of programmed cell death have been associated with cancer development. However, apoptosis resistance can also be the result of non-genetic stress adaptation as seen in the cancer-prone metabolic liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia (HT1). To clarify whether stress induced apoptosis resistance is a more common feature of chronic liver diseases an animal model of chronic cholestasis was examined. Studies were performed with mice before and two weeks following bile duct ligation and with Fah-/-and Fah/p21-/-mice before and after NTBC withdrawal. Here we show that bile-duct ligation induced profound resistance against Fas mAb-mediated hepatocyte death. The apoptosis-signaling pathway was blocked downstream of caspase-8 activation and proximal to mitochondrial cytochrome C release. In controls, activation of the Fas receptor resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of Bid and its subsequent cleavage, whereas Bid remained phosphorylated and uncleaved in chronic cholestasis. To determine the significance of the alterations of Bid phosphorylation seen here in BDL mice, we wondered whether a similar pattern was present in other liver models. Resistance against apoptosis seen in HT1 does not occur in mice which are doubly mutant in the gene responsible for HT1, Fah, and the cell cycle regulatory protein p21/Cip/Waf. Fah/p21-/-mice develop a similar liver damage as WT mice following Fas mAb injection. Phosphorylation of Bid was not different in Fah-/-/p21-/-and Fah-/-mice before Fas mAb injection. Importantly however, Bid was not dephosphorylated in the apoptosis resistant Fah-/-mutants but almost completely dephosphorylated in the apoptosis competent Fah-/-/p21-/-double mutant mice following Fas mAb injection. In summary, our data show that resistance against apoptosis is a common feature of chronic liver diseases such as HT-1 and chronic cholestasis. In terms of evolution, this can be viewed as an adaptive response, allowing survival during chronic liver injury. However, survival might come at a price, because hepatocytes can retain DNA damage and become malignantly transformed. We propose therefore a model in which phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Bid determines the apoptotic threshold of hepatocytes during chronic liver diseases. Understanding the changes in apoptosis sensitivity during chronic diseases might help to reduce the long-term risk of cancer development.",

Exp Cell Res 304;2005, and unpublished data). Mallory bodies, the hepatocyte cytosolic inclusions composed of CKs, ubiquitin and heat shock proteins (HSPs), are observed in many liver diseases, however, the precise mechanism and significance of these structures are poorly understood. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the organelle responsible for proper folding and delivery of proteins to the secretory pathway. One central regulator of this process is the quality control machinery, which contains a sophisticated protein proofreading and elimination of the unfolded proteins. Therefore, failure of this function leads to increase of the defective proteins in the cell and may result in the formation of inclusion bodies. Recently, it has been considered that oxidative stress influences the pathogenesis and progression of many liver diseases including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver injury and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, we examined whether the oxidative stress induced the ER stress in a cultured human hepatoma cell line (Huh7 cells). Moreover, we examined the effect of oxidative stress on localization of CKs, ubiquitin and HSPs. Treatment with exogenous glucose oxidase resulted in the continuous oxidative stress to the cultured cells (Tirosh A et al. J Biol Chem 274;1999), and phosphorylated PERK, which is one of the hallmarks of the ER stress, was upregulated in the Western blotting. Under this condition, CK inclusion formation appeared near the nuclei in the immunofluorescent analyses. These inclusions were localized at gamma-tubulin, a marker of microtubule organizing center as well. Moreover, HSP 70, 90 and ubiquitin were redistributed to the CK inclusions. We showed for the first time that oxidative stress affects the formation of the CK inclusions in cultured cells and this influence may be through induction of the ER stress. We also speculate that Mallory body formation occurs under the continuous oxidative stress condition.",

Little is known of the transcriptional regulation of the basolateral transporter, although results from ASBT null mice suggested a positive regulation by bile acids. Methods/Results: The 5\u0408 flanking regions of mOST\u2423 (1.7 and 1.2kb) and mOST\u2424 (3.0 and 0.9 kb) were subcloned into a luciferase reporter. The 1.7 kb mOST\u2423 encoded potential cis-elements for both liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) whereas mOST\u2424 1.2 only encoded the LRH-1 site. mOST\u2424 3.0 and 0.9kb encoded both LRH-1 and FXR sites. Promoter constructs were transiently transfected into CT-26 mouse intestinal cells, that endogenously express mOST\u2423-\u2424 and ASBT mRNA. Following CDCA treatment, endogenous expression of mOST\u2423 and \u2424 mRNA were induced and ASBT was repressed. CDCA treatment of transfected CT-26 cells led at least 4-fold increases in the activities of mOST\u2423 1.7kb and both mOST\u2424 constructs, whereas mOST\u2423 1.2kb activity decreased 73%. Co-transfection of FXR enhanced the bile acid response of mOST\u2423 1.7kb and both mOST\u2424 constructs. CDCA activation of mOST\u2423 1.7kb was abrogated by a dominant negative FXR or siRNA-knockdown of FXR; mutation of the potential FXRE in mOST\u2423 1.7kb reduced basal promoter activity and eliminated the bile acid response. Reducing endogenous FXR activity using siRNA knockdown of the familial intrahepatic cholestasis-1 (FIC1) gene reduced endogenous mOST\u2423 and \u2424 mRNA expression, while increasing ASBT mRNA expression in CT-26 cells. FIC1 knock-down also reduced the activity of the mouse OST\u24231.7kb promoter construct. Cotransfection of SHP decreased basal promoter activity of all four constructs, whereas SHP siRNA (siSHP) increased promoter activity. siSHP in the presence of CDCA showed enhanced promoter activation in all except the mOST\u2423 1.2kb construct. Cotransfection of LRH-1 increased mOST\u2423 and mOST\u2424 promoter activity, while the opposite was seen in siLRH-1 co-transfection. Mutation of the LRH cis element in mOST\u2423 1.7kb promoter abrogated siSHP mediated increase in promoter activity. Conclusions: The mOST\u2423 and \u2424 promoters contain functional FXR and LRH elements, that mediate positive and negative feedback regulation by bile acids. The positive response to bile acids is dominant. The physiologic consequences of both responses are not yet known, but may permit fine regulation of bile acid efflux. The profound diarrhea seen in FIC1 disease may be partly explained by enhanced expression of ASBT in the setting of reduced OST\u2423-OST\u2424.",

The key regulator is farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is one of RXR-heterodimer dependent nuclear receptors and acts as a sensor of intracellular bile acids including chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). FXR activates the transcription of bile salt excretory pump (BSEP), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and ileal BA-binding protein (I-BABP) genes, which play important roles in BA synthesis and transport. However, the transcriptional regulation of these FXR-induced gene expression has not been fully clarified and there is considerable cross-talk among the nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Recently, we have shown the inhibition of FXR-induced BSEP gene expression by ligand-activated vitamin D receptor (VDR). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether VDR could influence the transcriptional regulation of the other FXR-induced gene expression as well. Methods: CV-1 cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for rat FXR and a luciferase-based reporter gene containing the promoter regions of the human BSEP (-165 to \u03e98), SHP (-332 to \u03e910), or mouse I-BABP (-1031 to \u03e940) gene. The FXR transactivation assays were performed with or without the transfection of expression plasmids for human VDR or the other RXR-partners including RAR-alpha, TR-beta1, LXR-alpha, and mouse PPAR-gamma in the presence or absence of the corresponding specific ligands. The in vitro protein-protein binding assays were performed using FXR fusion protein to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Real-time PCR was performed to quantitate mRNA levels of BSEP and SHP in HepG2 cells and I-BABP in Caco2 cells. Results: VDR inhibited the CDCA-induced FXR transactivation of the three reporter constructs (BSEP, SHP and I-BABP) in the presence of 1, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD), but not in the absence of VitD (maximal inhibition of 51%, 67%, and 88%, respectively; p\u03fd0.05). Similar inhibitory effects were not seen with the other RXR-partners tested. In vitro translated VDR directly bound to GST-FXR.

Using separate groups of mice fed 7 d with chow (WT, n\u03ed8; KO, n\u03ed6) or fenofibrate (WT, n\u03ed6; KO, n\u03ed6), rates of hepatic TG secretion (mg/kg/ hr) were determined from serial measurements of plasma TG following i.v. administration of the lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, Triton WR1339. Results: In chow fed mice, the absence of PC-TP expression was associated with a 62% greater concentration (mean\u03eeSEM) of hepatic TG (WT, 7.3\u03ee0.5; KO, 11.8\u03ee1.6). Neither plasma concentration of TG (WT, 89\u03ee13; KO, 65\u03ee17) nor \u2424-hydroxybutyrate (WT, 0.33\u03ee0.05; KO, 0.30\u03ee0.03), which reflect rates of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, was influenced by PC-TP expression. However, hepatic TG secretion rates were 34% higher in KO mice (WT, 76\u03ee5; KO, 102\u03ee5). In WT mice, fenofibrate feeding increased both hepatic TG concentrations and secretion rates by 2 fold, without influencing plasma concentrations of TG or \u2424-hy-droxybutyrate. By contrast, fenofibrate feeding to KO mice did not change TG concentrations in liver or plasma and increased hepatic TG secretion more modestly (1.5 fold). These changes were accompanied by a 43% reduction in plasma \u2424-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Conclusions: In chow fed KO mice, elevated hepatic TG concentrations and secretion rates in the absence of reduced fatty acid oxidation indicate that PC-TP expression limits either de novo lipogenesis or the supply of plasma-derived fatty acids. Moreover, unaltered plasma TG concentrations in KO mice imply that PC-TP also reduces peripheral utilization or storage. Impaired fatty acid oxidation in fenofibrate fed KO mice is compensated by further upregulation of hepatic TG secretion. We speculate that defective regulation of TG metabolism by PC-TP may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

            "text": "Methods: Bile duct ligation (BDL) was used in single (FXRKO and PXRKO) and double knockout (P/FXRKO) 8-week old male mice, as a model of acute cholestasis. They were sacrificed after 6 days, and serum and tissue samples collected to measure serum lipids, LFTs, and histology, with quantitative morphometric analysis of necrosis. RNA was prepared and RT-PCR used to evaluate expression of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, and transport. Individual bile acids were quantitated using LC/MS. Results: FXRKO mice had a mortality and morbidity advantage after BDL. PXRKO mice had more extensive areas of liver injury (17%) than WT mice (3.3%), as we have previously demonstrated (1). However, FXRKO mice had a reduction in area of bile infarcts (0.6%), and the P/FXRKO genotype also had a marked reduction in liver injury compared to PXRKO. FXRKO mice had a biphasic lipid profile after BDL, with an increase in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides by day 6, and expression of apoAV was reduced in these mice. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activator-coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were both regulated by FXR, implicating a pivotal role for this NR in gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis. Induction of both Mdr1 and Mdr2, crucial drug and phospholipid transporters, was also found to be regulated by FXR, and not PXR, as had previously been suggested in the literature. Conclusions: FXR co-ordinately regulates a broad range of metabolic pathways, including bile acid synthesis and transport, lipoprotein and lipid metabolism, and hepatic gluconeogenesis. In addition, we found that manipulation of multiple NRs offers greater potential for therapeutic intervention in cholestasis. These nuclear receptors may represent therapeutic targets for the treatment of cholestasis and common metabolic disorders.",

            "text": "Introduction: Anti-cholesterol antibodies (ACHA) are natural antibodies against the 3beta-OH group of free cholesterol. Binding to LDL/VLDL has been reported, but not to the cell membranes. High level ACHA was reported in SLE, HIV and hepatitis C infected patients. ACHA is subject of recent research in atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolaemia is common in PBC, although its clinical significance is not fully clarified. We aimed to investigate ACHA and its correlation with lipid and clinical parameters in patients with PBC compared to healthy controls, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Wilson disease patients. Subjects and Methods: 108 patients with PBC (age:59.3\u00b0\u00d3 9.6 years, each AMA positive, stage I-IV), 31 patients with NASH (age: 51,8\u00b0\u00d3 16,6) and 52 patients with Wilson disease (age:28,5\u00b0\u00d3 12,4) were investigated. Age-matched healthy persons served as controls for each group. ACHA was measured in sera by solid phase enzyme immunoassay as described. Correlation between ACHA and other parameters as serum total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglyceride(TG), serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, IgA, IgG, IgM was analyzed. Results: Higher serum ACHA level was found in patients with PBC (41.9\u00b0\u00d3 25.1 AU/ml) compared to both healthy controls (28.8\u00b0\u00d3 11.3 AU/ml, p\u03fd0.0001) and NASH (34,2\u00b0\u00d3 15,5 AU/ml, p\u03fd0,05) patients. The ACHA values showed an increasing tendency with severity of PBC. Comparing stages III\u03e9IV with stages I\u03e9II the difference was significant (p\u03ed0.013). The serum cholesterol level was slightly elevated in PBC (total: 6.0\u00b0\u00d3 1.1mmol/l), while serum TG level was in the normal range (1.5\u00b0\u00d3 0.8 mmol/l). In NASH patients there were no significant difference in the level of serum ACHA compared to the agematched control group despite of the elevated serum cholesterol level. No correlation was found between serum ACHA concentration and either serum cholesterol level, titre of AMA, immunglobulin levels or any liver function test. In Wilson disease, surprisingly we found decreased serum ACHA level compared to age-matched healthy controls (17,4\"b8,9 AU/ ml, p\u03ed0,000005). The serum ACHA levels in the three control groups were almost the same. Conclusion: Our novel finding of elevated serum ACHA in PBC is in concordance with published data on ACHA in SLE, although its significance is not known. Our results on stage-dependent elevation of serum levels of anti-cholesterol antibodies might stimulate further research to clarify the clinical significance of ACHA. The normal ACHA levels in NASH could shown that not only the hypercholesterolemia may be responsible for the elevated serum ACHA level in Wilson disease. defined. Numerous laboratories have shown increased levels of hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH-Chol) in females from various mouse species. This oxysterol, the product of CYP27A1 hydroxylation of cholesterol, has been proposed to function as a regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Our lab has shown that CYP27A1 specific activity and subsequently, intracellular levels of 27OH-Chol, can be regulated by mitochondrial cholesterol transport in human, rat and mouse hepatocytes. A regulable StARD1like mitochondrial cholesterol transporter has now been identified in human, rat and mouse hepatocytes as well as whole liver tissue (i.e. liver StAR). Objectives: To look for a correlation between higher liver 27OH-Chol levels in female C57BL mice and mitochondrial cholesterol transport; to explain the accumulation of this oxysterol in the liver where it is normally processed quickly to bile acids; and to look for resultant changes in hepatic and whole body cholesterol homeostasis. Results: Female mice showed 54% higher liver StAR protein levels than male controls of the same general age and weight. Hepatocellular CYP27A1 mRNA, protein, and specific activity were also higher (21%, 64%, and 43%, respectively). Interestingly, liver CYP7B mRNA and specific activity were dramatically lower (85% and 51% respectively). Hepatic 27OH-Chol levels were 8X's higher in female C57BL mice. HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were the same, while protein and specific activity were significantly lower (53% and 31% respectively). In females, higher hepatic LDL-receptor mRNA levels (15%) were coupled with significantly lower serum cholesterol levels (12-19%). Conclusion: Numerous factors may contribute to lower serum cholesterol levels in females. This study demonstrates that a change in the balance of mitochondrial cholesterol transport, CYP27A1 activity, and CYP7B activity can regulate cholesterol homeostasis by coordinately increasing cholesterol metabolism, altering 27OH-Chol levels, lowering cholesterol synthesis, and increasing hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Previous studies have suggested that 27OH-Chol plays little to no role in cholesterol homeostasis in the liver due to its rapid degradation to bile acids. This study demonstrates that there are physiological instances in which higher levels of 27OH-Chol play a significant role in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis.",

            "text": "Bile acid biosynthesis is the primary pathway for cholesterol degradation in vivo. There are two major pathways of bile acid synthesis: the \"neutral\" pathway, initiated by highly regulated microsomal cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1); and the \"acidic\" pathway, initiated by cholesterol 27a-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and regulated by mitochondrial cholesterol transport. The present study has identified that a novel regulatory nuclear oxysterol generated in mitochondria via the \"acidic\" pathway upregulates cholesterol uptake and increases rates of bile acid synthesis. At forty-eight hours after infection with recombinant adenovirus encoding a mitochondria cholesterol transport protein (StAR) in primary rat hepatocytes, bile acid synthesis increased by 5-fold. Concurrently, a 14C-oxysterol with retention time at 11.50 min in HPLC elution profile was dramatically increased both in the mitochondria and in the nucleus, suggesting a mitochondriagenerated oxysterol translocates to the nucleus. LC/MS/MS analysis shows the nuclear oxysterol with a molecular weight 482 in the parental spectra, and the presence of fragment ions at m/z 80, 97, and 124 in its daughter spectra. An oxysterol product could be extracted into the chloroform phase from methanol/water phase after sulfatase treatment, suggesting the nuclear oxysterol is a sulfated C27 oxysterol. Addition of the nuclear extract from the cells overexpressing StAR or the addition of the purified oxysterol to primary rat hepatocytes significantly increased cholesterol uptake and the rates of bile acid synthesis by 4-fold, suggesting this oxysterol is a regulatory oxysterol. These results demonstrate a mechanism by which the \"acidic\" pathway of bile acid synthesis generates a novel potent regulatory nuclear oxysterol in mitochondria, which translocates into the nucleus, upregulating cholesterol uptake and increasing bile acid synthesis. We conclude that the \"acidic\" pathway plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by generating potent regulatory oxysterols.",

These compounds or their esters are available in a variety of functional foods for human consumption. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of plant sterol-/stanol-enriched functional food is (partly) due to effects on expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport, via activation of the Liver X Receptor (LXR), rather than to intraluminal, competitive effects. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a sterol-poor semisynthetic diet (control) or semisynthetic diets containing cholesterol (0.12%) only or cholesterol combined with either plant sterols or plant stanols (0.5%) for four weeks. Feces, blood, liver and intestine were harvested for analysis of lipid composition and gene expression profiles. As anticipated, feeding cholesterol-enriched semisynthetic diet increased fecal neutral sterol excretion in C57BL/6J mice (\u03e961%). Addition of plant sterols or plant stanols to the diet resulted in a massive increase in neutral fecal sterol excretion (\u03e9268% and \u03e9166%, respectively, compared to cholesterol fed mice). Cholesterol-enrichment of the diet did not result in cholesterol accumulation in plasma. Instead, unesterified cholesterol, cholesterol ester and triglyceride concentrations increased in liver tissue of mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet (2.4-, 10.3-and 2.8-fold, respectively). Addition of plant sterols and plant stanols to the diet completely prevented this hepatic lipid accumulation. Hepatic expression of LXR target genes (e.g., Srebp1c: \u03e987%, Abcg5: \u03e9194%) was highly induced on cholesterol diet when compared to cholesterol-free diet. In the intestine, only a small induction of Abca1 expression (maximal 2-fold) was found in mice receiving cholesterol or plant sterol diet, without any effects on other LXR target genes. No cumulative effect of cholesterol plus plant sterols/stanols on hepatic or intestinal gene expression was found.",

Although previous experimental evidence has identified oxidative stress as a potential hazard and mitochondria as a possible target, the determinants of susceptibility to nimesulide-induced liver injury have remained unclear. -Aim: To explore whether underlying impairment of mitochondrial function and mildly increased oxidative stress might precipitate potential hepatic adverse effects of nimesulide. -Experimental approach: We used heterozygous superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2 \u03e9/-) mice on a C57BL/6 background as a model, because these mice exhibit clinically silent mitochondrial abnormalities but otherwise appear phenotypically normal. Nimesulide was administered daily for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg, ip, bid, comparable to human therapeutic doses based on a dose scaling factor). -Results: Nimesulide was readily absorbed and attained peak plasma levels similar to human therapeutic plasma concentrations. Drug treatment did not cause any detectable liver injury, as assessed by plasma ALT activity and histopathology. However, we found that nimesulide potentiated mitochondrial oxidative damage (-51% decrease in aconitase activity, \u03e934% increase in protein carbonyls) in the liver of Sod2 \u03e9/mice, but not their wild-type littermates, as compared to the respective vehicle controls. Furthermore, nimesulide treatment resulted in increased hepatic cytosolic levels of cytochrome c (\u03e987%) and caspase-3 activity (\u03e938%). Finally, we demonstrated that exposure of mitochondria isolated from untreated Sod2 \u03e9/mice to nimesulide caused a marked net increase in superoxide anion formation (dihydroethidine fluorescence), while the drug did not produce any detectable increased oxidative stress in mitochondria from Sod2 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. -Conclusions: Prolonged administration of low doses of nimesulide can superimpose an oxidant stress, potentiate mitochondrial oxidative damage, and activate pro-apoptotic factors in mice with genetically compromised mitochondrial function, while nimesulide has no detectable effects in healthy control animals. Thus, inherited or acquired abnormalities in mitochondrial function may be one of the contributing determinants of susceptibility to nimesulide-induced idiosyncratic liver injury.",

Repetitive doses of AP produce resistance to its toxicity in human and animals, though the mechanism is poorly understood. Mrp2 and Mrp3 transport the major metabolite AG through the canalicular and basolateral pole of the hepatocyte for its biliary and urinary elimination, respectively. We evaluated the effect of AP treatment on Mrps expression in rats, as a potential mechanism of decreased drug toxicity. Methods: Male Wistar rats (250-290 g) were used: Repeated protocol (R), rats were injected ip with daily increasing doses of AP (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 g/kg); Single protocol (S), rats received a dose of 1.0 g/kg; Controls (C) received the same volumes of vehicle. Experiments were performed 24 hr after the last injection. Biliary and urinary AP and AG excretion rates were determined in vivo after iv administration of a single test dose of AP (150 mg/kg). Entero-hepatic recirculation of the drug (after same test dose) was estimated in vivo through biliary excretion of AG in animals with intact vs interrupted enterohepatic circuit. Expression of Mrp2 and Mrp3 was evaluated by western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence. Mrp3 activity was assessed in basolateral plasma membrane vesicles. AST and ALT were measured as markers of liver damage. Survival to AP was calculated as living vs total injected rats. Data are means\u03eeSD, n\u03ed3-6. Results: Cumulative biliary AG excretion (% dose) after 180 min decreased in R (3.2\u03ee1.9) and S (5.1\u03ee2.2) vs C (15.2\u03ee4.9) (p\u03fd0.05), whereas urinary excretion increased in R (21.9\u03ee2.5) and S (20.2\u03ee4.6) vs C (10.7\u03ee3.5) (p\u03fd0.05). Biliary and urinary AP excretion was minimally affected by AP pretreatment. Biliary AG excretion (nmol/min/g liver) in animals with preserved recirculation was lower in R (0.9\u03ee0.6) vs C (2.9\u03ee1.2) (p\u03fd0.05) and similar between groups in the model of interrupted circulation, suggest-ing diminished AP recirculation in R. Mrp2 plasma membrane level increased by 65% in R or S, whereas Mrp3 increased by 540 and 400% in R and S, respectively. Confocal Mrp2 and Mrp3 detection and Mrp3 activity confirmed preferential Mrp3 induction. Liver damage markers increased to a lesser extent in R vs S, agreeing with higher survival in R (92%) vs S (57%). Conclusions: In the intestine AG is hydrolyzed and the liberated AP is partially reabsorbed. Our data demonstrate a shift from biliary to urinary elimination of AG in AP pretreated groups. Mrp3 induction may contribute to attenuate AP hepatotoxicity by decreasing the permanence of the intact drug in the entero-hepatic circuit, particularly in response to chronic treatment.",

Liver histology was assessed by H-E staining, and serum ALT levels were measured. Tissue glutathione (GSH) contents were measured spectrophotometrically based on formation of thioethers. Serum TNF-\u2423 levels were measured by ELISA. For in vitro study, hepatocytes were isolated from both strains by collagenase perfusion and differential centrifugations, and cells were preincubated in Waymouth's medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 hours. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in isolated hepatocytes was then determined fluorometrically using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H 2 DCFDA). Results: Liver histology from KK-Ay mice showed small vesicular fat accumulation in hepatocytes with mild inflammatory infiltration, indicating that KK-Ay mice develop mild steatohepatitis spontaneously. AAP as low as 300 mg/kg induced focal necrosis in the hepatic lobules in KK-Ay mice, but not in C57Bl/6 mice. In turn, elevation in serum ALT levels 6 hours after treatment with 600 mg/kg AAP was significantly higher in KK-Ay mice than in C57Bl/6 mice, the values reaching 6937\u03ee1510 IU/L and 2956\u03ee530 IU/L, respectively. Hepatic contents of GSH in KK-Ay mice were 20% lower than those in C57Bl/6 mice. Increases in serum TNF-\u2423 levels 6 hours after AAP treatment were the same in both strains. In hepatocytes isolated from C57Bl/6 mice, basal increment of DCF fluorescence for 3 hours was 281% over the initial levels, whereas DCF fluorescence was increased to 417% in the presence of 10 mM AAP for 3 hours as expected. In contrast, cells from KK-Ay mice, which contained obvious lipid droplets in cytoplasm, demonstrated higher basal increment (613%) as well as enhanced elevation in DCF fluorescence 3 hours after addition of AAP to the levels being 818% over controls. Conclusions: KK-Ay mice are more susceptible to AAP-induced toxic liver damage, most likely due to augmented oxidative stress in hepatocytes.

Results: Among 59 cholestatic patients, 3 DC specific mutations (L1082Q for ABCB4, D676Y and G855R for ABCB11) and one ICP specific ABCB4 mutation (L237I) were identified. In 55 cholestatic patients (21 DC; 34 ICP) without a disease-associated mutation, the ABCB11 SNP 1457T\u03feC distributed as TT genotype in 3, as TC in 4 and as CC in 14 of 21 DC patients. This genotype distribution was significantly different to healthy Caucasians (TT 38, TC 101, CC 66; p\u03ed0.006). The allelic frequency of the 1457C allele was higher for DC (76%) compared to Caucasians (57%; p\u03ed0.01). There was a similar trend between DC and DH (54%; p\u03ed0.059). Also, 1457T\u03feC was distributed significantly differently in 34 ICP patients (TT 2, TC 13 and CC 19) compared to 40 controls with normal pregnancies (TT 7, TC 15, CC 8; p\u03ed0.005) and Caucasians (p\u03ed0.017), resulting in a higher allelic frequency of the 1457C allele (75%) for ICP compared to controls (51%; p\u03ed0.002) and Caucasians (57%; p\u03ed0.003). In addition, 4 of 5 DC patients with contraceptive-induced cholestasis exhibited the CC genotype. Thus, the 1457C allele occurs in 75% of cholestatic patients with no additional mutation. Conclusion: Our data indicate that ABCB11 1457T\u03feC which has been associated with low BSEP expression occurs more frequently in patients with DC and ICP and is therefore a predisposing risk factor for these two forms of acquired cholestasis.",

Pradefovir is a CYP3A4 activated prodrug of PMEA with excellent liver-targeting properties in rats and better safety than adeofovir dipivoxil in a one-month monkey toxicity study. Thus pradefovir may optimize its clinical efficacy with potentially lower nephrotoxicity compared to adefovir dipivoxil. Aim: To evaluate the metabolic conversion of pradefovir to PMEA and its potential as an inhibitor or inducer for cytochrome P450 (CYP). Methods: Metabolic conversion of pradefovir to PMEA was the evaluated with major cDNAexpressed CYPs and human liver microsomes with and without the addition of ketoconazole and MAb3A4. The potential of pradefovir (0.2, 2 and 20 M) as an inhibitor for various CYP isozymes was evaluated in human liver microsomes. The potential of pradefovir (0.1, 1 and 10 g/mL) as an inducer was evaluated in human hepatocytes following once daily treatment for three consecutive days and in rats following daily dosing of 300 mg/kg for 8 days. Results: CYP3A4 is the only P450 enzyme catalyzing the conversion of pradefovir to PMEA among major cDNA-expressed CYPs. It was converted to PMEA in human liver microsomes with a Km of 60 M, a Vmax of 228 pmol/min/mg protein and an intrinsic clearance of 3.8 l/min/mg protein. The addition of ketoconazole and MAb3A4 significantly inhibited the conversion of pradefovir to PMEA in human liver microsomes. Ketoconazole was a non-competitive inhibitor for the conversion of pradefovir to PMEA in human liver microsomes with an inhibition constant of 12.5 nM. Pradefovir was neither a direct inhibitor nor a mechanism based inhibitor for CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes. Pradefovir was neither an inducer of CYP1A2 nor CYP3A4/5 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. In rats, daily oral dosing of pradefovir did not affect body weight, liver weight and liver-body weight ratio, liver microsomal protein content, total CYP content, enzyme activities for CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP3A and apoprotein content for CYP1A1, CYP2B1/2, CYP3A1/2 and CYP4A1/3. Conclusions: Pradefovir is a substrate of CYP3A4, but neither an inhibitor nor an inducer for CYPs.",

            "text": "In commercially available Human Serum Albumin (HSA) preparations Octanoate (OC) and N-acetyltryptophanate (NAC) are added during the process of pasteurization which results into impaired binding characteristics of HSA compared to native human serum albumin as detected by measuring the Albumin Binding Capacity (ABiC). For patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis or acute liver failure, those molecules are challenging, as they are poorly metabolized in this state. Therefore, an impairement of ABiC after administration of small amounts of stabilizer containing HAS must be assumed, whereas a removal of those ligands before administration might reverse such an impairement. Methods: Commercial HSA, alternative preparations containing less OC and NAC and commercial HSA which was purified from those ligands by a \"bed side\" medical device were used to administer albumin therapy in an in vitro model. Plasma samples from healthy donors \"spiked\" with albumin bound toxins as well as Plasma Samples from patients with liver failure containing albumin bound toxins were used as \"patient model\". After adding the above described albumin preparations in an equivalent of 1:8 to the patients samples, the ABiC was measured by adding a binding site II (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine, DS) and subsequently measuring the amount of unbound DS by fluorescence detection after ultrafiltration, which corresponds to the albumin binding capacity. Results: In plasma samples with an impaired ABiC, an improvement could be achieved by adding deligandized albumin, whereas commercial HSA was associated with a further decrease of ABiC. Even in a and healthy plasma donor samples with a normal baseline ABiC (median 116%; range 93 -169) it was impaired if HSA was added (median 77%; range 74 -91%). Conclusions: As recent papers have demonstrated the role of albumin binding sites in regulating vasoactive substances, as prostaglandins and NO, the presence of octanoate and NAC might be responsible for the unsatisfying performance of HSA in clinical studies, especially in hemodynamic impairement due to liver failure. disease. Among different tests investigated so far, the 13C methacetin breath test (MBT) appears to be particularly suitable for the assessment of hepatic functional reserve. Up to now, stable isotopic analysis of the MBT has been carried out with isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and infrared spectroscopy. The aim of this study was: 1) to compare the new molecular correlation spectroscopy with a continuous, online, automatic breath collection and analysis system (BreathID \u2122 ,Ordion, Israel) to IRMS in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 2) to assess the ability of MBT test to differentiate hepatitis C patients with early and late stages of fibrosis using Oridion analysis system. Materials and methods: Eight patients with chronic hepatitis C and biopsy proven early stage of fibrosis (Ishak score 1-2) and eight patients with liver cirrhosis (Ishak 5-6) were enrolled in this study. After overnight fasting each subject received 75mg of 13C methacetin per os. Breath samples were collected at baseline and every three minutes over 120 minutes after administration of 13C methacetin by molecular correlation spectroscopy. In parallel patients provided a separate breath sample every ten minutes for IRMS analysis. Results were expressed as delta over baseline [DOB( %)] and the cumulative percentage of 13C dose recovered at 30 minutes [cPDR30min(% )] and maximum percentage of 13C dose recovered [PDRmax (%/h)] were calculated. Correlation between both methods was tested by Pearson test and differences between the early and advanced fibrosis groups by MannWhitney U Test. Results: A high linear correlation was found between the two tests for cPDR at 30 minutes (R2 of 0.97; p\u03fd0.001). In addition, both cPDR at 30 minutes and PDRmax in patients with cirrhosis were significantly lower compared to patients with low grade fibrosis (Table) . Conclusion: The MBT obtained by molecular correlation spectroscopy with a continuous, online, automatic, breath collection and analysis system is an easy and precise method to differentiate fibrosis grades in patients with chronic hepatitis C infections in clinical practice. This new test shows a high linear correlation with the gold standard isotopic ratio mass spectrometry. Further validation studies in larger patients groups are necessary.

After another episode of acute cellular rejection, he was discharged on MMF and SIR. He rapidly became symptomatic and within one week had new ascites with a rise in ALT and ALP. SIR was stopped and CYA reintroduced. Within three weeks, ascites and symptoms had resolved and ALT had normalized. Patient Two was a 41 yo man with hypertension who underwent a living-related renal transplant in May, 2002. He was maintained on TAC and two months later manifested pruritus and increased liver enzymes. Despite discontinuation of commonly hepatotoxic drugs, the liver enzymes and bilirubin continued to increase with the ALT peaking at 1794 IU/ml. TAC was stopped and his liver enzymes decreased. A liver biopsy was performed which demonstrated marked cholestatic hepatitis with eosinophils. The offending agent was not clear and after several months, TAC was reintroduced with a rapid rise in his liver enzymes. SIR was then introduced and shortly thereafter the liver enzymes and bilirubin increased again. A second liver biopsy was done which revealed cholestatic hepatitis with lobular collapse. SIR was held but elevation of the liver enzymes and bilirubin persisted. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed related to renal failure due to rejection and ATN, fungal sepsis, and liver failure. These cases appear to represent tacrolimus hepatotoxicity and cross-toxicity with sirolimus. There are several previously documented cases of tacrolimus-or sirolimus-induced hepatotoxicity, but we are not aware of any cases of cross-toxicity of tacrolimus and sirolimus. The late Hyman Zimmerman (\"Hy\" to his many friends) observed repeatedly that\u00b0\u00b0Drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice is a serious lesion. The mortality ranges from 10 to 50 percent.\u00b0\u03ee Hy never claimed a law or rule; he never defined numerically what serum transaminase or bilirubin level was needed to fulfill the statement. Since 1999, we at the FDA have referred to the combination of elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity at least 3x upper limit of the reference range (ULRR) AND of total bilirubin (TBL) concentration of 2xULRR in a patient with drug-induced hepatocellular (but not cholestatic) liver injury as \"Hy's Law\" cases. To test the validity of that working assumption, we have developed methods to analyze clinical trial data. We have found, from studies of over 7000 thousand study participants followed for 1 to 5 years, that the combination test is a useful indicator of potentially serious liver disease, that has far greater specificity than elevations of ALT alone. Very high specificity is needed to avoid too many false positive results for low incidence problems such as drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In one study of 3248 study subjects on placebo followed serially by ALT and TBL over 5 years, the combination test had a far lower error rate of its predictive power, for non-drug-induced serious liver disease, of positive test result (16.7%) than ALT\u00b0\u00dd 3xULRR alone (88.6%),. Another study of a clinical trial with 3922 subjects followed for 3 years, half on a control drug (Drug C) and half on an experimental agent (Drug X), showed marked discrepancies between the two treatments. Results: The mortality rate was 23.2 per 1000 patient years in the hepatotoxicity group compared with 10.9 per 1000 patient years in the control group (p\u03ed0.04). The mortality rate in both groups was significantly higher than in the sample of the background population (3.5 per 1000 patient years; p\u03fd0.0001). The excess mortality in both groups appeared to persist for 10 years after inclusion. Of the 21 deaths in the hepatotoxicity group, four were due to natural causes, 15 were due to suicide or likely suicide, one was due to accident, and one was due to unknown causes. Of the 11 deaths in the control group, three were due to natural causes, four were due to suicide, three were due to accident, and one was due to unknown causes. There were no differences in the occurrence of somatic comorbidity including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, diabetes, pancreatitis, or malignancy between groups. Conclusions: Compared with the background population, survivors of acetaminophen poisoning had an excess mortality that was exclusively explained by the difference in deaths from non-natural causes, mainly suicide. The excess mortality was higher after survival from severe acetaminophen poisoning the after uncomplicated acetaminophen poisoning. The difference in mortality between the groups No excess somatic comorbidity was observed in survivors from complicated acetaminophen poisoning, suggesting that acetaminophen toxicity in general does not produce longterm somatic sequelae.",

Among many novel trials targeting recurrent tumors, the immunomodulatory agents including cytokines and chemokines are believed to enhance the innate and acquired immune responses in conjunction with tumor cell apoptosis induced with the suicide gene therapy. We have reported that the antitumor effects of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system are enhanced by codelivery of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Cancer Gene Ther 10:260,2003). The current study was designed to evaluate the prolonged immunomodulatory effects of a bicistronic adenovirus vector expressing both HSV-tk and MCP-1 on HCC cells. Methods: Bicistronic recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector Ad-tk-MCP1 harboring HSV-tk and human MCP-1 genes, and Ad-tk and Ad-lacZ expressing HSV-tk and the control lacZ genes, respectively, under the universal CAG promoter were prepared. To evaluate the in vitro effects, we measured cytokine production by macrophages or dendritc cells (DCs) when co-cultured with HCC cells infected with the rAds. To estimate the immune-mediated effects in a murine model of HCC, Huh7 cells were subcutaneously transplanted to athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu) on day 0, and subsequently eradicated with Ad-tk-MCP1 or Ad-tk. The control mice were injected with mitomycin C treated Huh7 cells and Ad-LacZ. On day 14 these mice were rechallenged with Huh7 cells, and tumor development was monitored. Results: Macrophages and DCs secreted large amounts of IL-12 when co-cultured with apoptotic HCC cells induced with Ad-tk, and further produced it with those infected with Ad-tk-MCP1 (P\u03fd0.05). In the mouse model, the growth of rechallenged tumors was markedly suppressed when primary tumor cells had been eradicated with Ad-tk-MCP1 compared to the mice treated with Ad-tk or Ad-lacZ (P\u03fd0.001). In animals treated with Ad-tk-MCP1, serum levels of IL-12 and IL-18 were significantly elevated after the administration of rechallenged tumor cells, and NK cells were recruited and IFN-gamma production was enhanced in the rechallenged tumor tissues. In addition, the antitumor responses were abolished by inactivating NK cells using anti-asialo GM1 antibody. Furthermore, the Ad-tk-MCP1 induced antitumor effects were similarly seen in wild type immunocompetent mice. Conclusions: Eradication of HCC cells using the suicide gene with codelivery of MCP-1 exerts the prolonged, NK cell-mediated antitumor effects in a model of HCC, suggesting a plausible strategy to prevent HCC recurrence.",

The current study, using an immunocompetent mouse model of intrahepatic hepatoma implantation with micrometastases, was designed to investigate whether MCP-1 gene delivery may potentiate the antitumor effects of the suicide gene system. Methods: BNL 1ME A.7R.1 (BNL), a BALB/c mousederived HCC cell line, was infected with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing HSV-tk (Ad-tk), MCP-1 (Ad-MCP1) and LacZ (Ad-LacZ) at various multiplicities of infection (MOIs): Ad-tk/Ad-MCP1 \u03ed 3/0.03 (group A), 3/0.3 (B) and 3/3 (C), Ad-tk/Ad-LacZ \u03ed 3/3 (D), and Ad-LacZ \u03ed 3 (E). BALB/c mice were transferred with these adenovirus-infected BNL cells via portal vein on day 0. Subsequently, 75 mg/kg of ganciclovir was administered for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21, liver tissues were weighed and examined by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR for expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18 and IFN\u2423, and splenocytes were tested for cytolytic activity against 51Cr-labeled BNL cells. Results: When compared to the mice in control group E, mean liver weight (\u03eeSD) was increased by 2.45 \u03ee 0.36 g in group A due to the intrahepatic implantation and growth of tumor cells on day 21, which was significantly smaller than that in group D (5.80 \u03ee 0.58 g; P\u03fd0.01). In contrast, the increase in liver weight was not suppressed in groups B and C whose tumor cells had been treated with higher titers of Ad-MCP1. In group A, immunohistochemical analysis of liver tissues showed remarkable Mac-1\u03e9 cell infiltration on day 1 and CD8\u03e9 T cell infiltration inside the tumor nodules on day 14, and IL-12 and IL-18 expression was increased after the tumor cell transfer. The highest tumor-specific cytolytic activity was induced with splenocytes of group A. Conclusions: The antitumor effects of the suicide gene are enhanced by codelivery of an adequate amount of MCP-1 in an intrahepatic implantation model of HCC, which are exclusively associated with the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and CD8\u03e9 T cells, T helper 1 cytokine gene expression and cytolytic activity of the splenocytes. The results suggest an immunomodulatory effect of MCP-1 on the suicide gene therapy of HCC by orchestrating the innate and acquired immune responses.",

Mononuclear cells from patients with chronic HCV infection express fgl2 mRNA and protein and successful treatment with IFN and ribavirin results in loss of fgl2. Fgl2 now has been shown to be expressed as both a membrane associated protein as well as in a soluble form. Soluble fgl2 generated by CD4\u03e9 CD25\u03e9 regulatory T cells in response to viral core protein and/or IFN-gamma binds to dendritic cells (DC) and inhibits DC maturation and subsequent T and B cell effector anti-viral function. To identify and characterize the receptor for fgl2, an fgl2 fusion protein was generated by transfection of CHO-K1 cells with a Pires-neo-3-Fc-fgl2 plasmid. Purified biotinylated fgl2 protein binding was studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages, bone marrow derived dendritic cells and LPS stimulated and unstimulated spleen cells from mice resistant (A/J) and susceptible (Balb/cJ) mice. Fgl2 bound specifically to peritoneal macrophages, dendritic cells and LPS-stimulated B cells from susceptible mice, but did not bind to cells from resistant mice. Screening of a cDNA library constructed from receptor positive B cells has tentatively identified the receptor for fgl2 as the low affinity Fc-gammaRIIB receptor which contains an immunotyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and is known to inhibit phagocytosis, ADCC and inflammatory mediator release and is associated with increased susceptibility to infection. Antibodies to CD16/32 blocked binding of fgl2, confirming that the fc-gam-maRIIB is the fgl2 receptor. These studies demonstrate that soluble fgl2 binds to fc-gammaRIIB, expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells and provides a mechanism whereby experimental and human viruses may evade immune surveillance.",

            "text": "Introduction: Interferon-a (IFN) therapy causes thrombocytopenia induced partly by inadequate TPO production without decreased TPO-mRNA expression, pointing to a posttranscriptional control mechanism. Hepatocytes produce different TPO-transcripts through alternatively spliced 5'-UTR's with highly variable translation efficiencies due to upstream AUG codons. A short alternative spliced TPO mRNA isoform, lacking exon 2, displayed high efficiency of translation compared to the regularly spliced transcripts, suggesting that alternative splicing may serve as a control mechanism for TPO production in IFN therapy. Considering the contribution of SRp40 to the unusual high frequency of alternative splice site usage seen in liver, we hypothesized that HRS/SRp40 might be involved in the regulation of exon 2 skipping in TPO pre-mRNAs during IFN treatment. We have now addressed this by examining the splicing of both wild type and mutant forms of ABCB11. An in vitro minigene system was used to create constructs containing wild type ABCB11 exons 9 or 14, along with 500 bp of intronic sequence either side of these exons. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the E297G mutation (nt 890, A to G) to exon 9 and the D482G mutation (nt 1445, A to G) to exon 14. These constructs, along with the native minigene system, were introduced into HepG2 cells using liposome-mediated transfection. After 48 hours, total RNA was isolated and reverse transcription was performed. Subsequently, a PCR using primers specific to the spliced form of the minigene system was performed. Products were sized by electrophoresis to look for the inclusion/exclusion of the ABCB11 exons in the system, as well as variant splicing forms. PCR products sequenced to look for small product size changes. Real-time PCR was used to determine the levels of included/excluded products and variant splicing forms. Total RNA was also isolated from the liver of patients with either the E297G or D482G mutations. PCR products generated using primers in the exons flanking those under study, and they were sized and sequenced and levels measured by real-time PCR. E297G was spliced normally in the minigene system, as well as in the liver from affected patients. Furthermore, mRNA levels associated with this mutation are similar to that of wild type exon 9 in vitro and in vivo. The effect on protein trafficking and function is now being assessed. D482G was associated with a severe disruption of the normal splicing of exon 14, resulting in the predominance of a differentially sized PCR product compared to wild type. Therefore, the true mechanism by which D482G causes liver disease is primarily at the level of disrupting ABCB11 mRNA processing. Integrity of mRNA processing is relatively difficult to analyse, but disruption is probably an underestimated mechanism of human disease.",

The activation of caspases pathway and apoptosis were confirmed by in vitro studies on transfected HepG2 cells over-and under-expressing Hint2 treated with anti-Fas and actinomycin D. Microarray analysis revealed that HINT2 expression was significantly reduced in the hepatocellular carcinomas, but not in the surrounding cirrhotic tissue. In contrast, the expression of HINT1 and HINT3 mRNAs were not reduced in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Further analysis of this collection of 91 hepatocellular carcinomas, whose gene expression profile differed according to the prognosis, revealed that HINT2 mRNA was less abundant in the subclass (n\u03ed40) of HCC with a poor prognosis when compared with the subclass (n\u03ed51) with better prognosis (1.7-fold, p\u03fd1.0 x 10-5 Previous work from our group has indicated that the transcriptional response to IFN-\u2423 varies between different donors in vitro, which lead us to hypothesize that the analysis of the in vivo IFN response in HCV patients might reveal specific profiles that are associated with response and non-response to therapy. To identify those profiles, 21 caucasian patients were treated with standard combination antiviral therapy consisting of pegylated IFN-\u24232b (1.5g/kg body weight once weekly) in combination with ribavirin (800-1200 mg daily) for 12 months (HCV genotype 1, n\u03ed14) or 6 months (HCV genotype 2/3, n\u03ed1/6), respectively. Peripheral blood was collected 12h before and 12h after the first injection of IFN-\u2423 and the transcriptional profile was analysed using human genomic microarrays (Affymetrix HG U133A) and quantitative real-time rt-PCR. Three data sets were obtained and analysed: a) basal expression (BE): expression level 12h before the first injection of IFN, b) induced expression (IE): expression level 12h after the first injection and c) fold change (FC): fold difference between BE and IE. Then, class prediction was performed using the PAM software package after pre-filtering the initial 22.000 genes by selecting those that were present in at least 20% of the patients, resulting in 8238 genes. So far, 18 patients have completed the study with 2 patients in follow-up and one patient lost to follow-up. 7 patients were non-responders (NR) to therapy while 11 patients had a SVR. BE, IE and FC were compared between NR and SVR using the PAM software. The data indicate that the SVR can be predicted in all three data sets with different levels of accuracy. FC was the only parameter that allowed correct class prediction in all patients. 100% of the patients were classified correctly with 97 genes, while only 13 and 2 genes were necessary to correctly classify 95% and 90% of the patients, respectively. Analysis of BE and IE revealed maximum levels of accuracy of 95% (12 genes) and 90% (14 genes), respectively. Interestingly, the ISGs that predicted SVR did not overlap with those associated with the immediate antiviral activitiy of IFN. These data indicate that a sustained virological response in HCV monoinfected patients can be predicted by analysis of the transcriptome before or at the very beginning of combination therapy. It suggests that the SVR is largely dependent upon the genetic background of the patient provided she or he is adherent to therapy. Finally, the functional analysis of the differentially regulated genes that were identified in this study could lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to improve the efficacy of HCV therapy.",

A total of 307 mRNAs consisting of interferon-inducible, interferon pathway, immune response related and housekeeping genes were profiled using one-step realtime RT-PCR. Gene expression data, early virologic response at week 12 (EVR), and SVR were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Results: One hundred thirteen treatment-na\u00efve HepC patients were enrolled and treated with PEG-IFN-a plus ribavirin. To date, 28 patients with HCV genotype 1 had SVR, other clinical characterization, and gene expression data. Twenty-five of these 28 patients also had EVR, and the predictive values of EVR were assessed. Using univariate logistic regression analysis, we identified a subset of mRNAs whose expression levels prior to treatment were associated with SVR (p\u03fd0.05), but they were not statistically predictive for treatment outcome. The expression profiles of 14 mRNAs at week 12 were significantly associated with treatment outcome (p\u03fd0.01) based on univariate analysis. These mRNAs are transcribed from IRF3, IRF4, TLR7, IFN-inducible genes, genes in NFkappaB pathway, and immune response related genes. A subset of 4 mRNAs was further selected using the Least Angle Regression method. Based on leave-one-out cross validation analysis of the model with these 4 mRNAs, the predictive values of the gene expression signature at week 12 in HCV genotype 1 patients for ultimate treatment outcome are compared with the predictive values of EVR in Table  1 . Conclusions: Our preliminary findings identified a set of genes whose expression levels at an early stage of combination therapy are associated with treatment outcome for HCV genotype 1 patients. The expression profiles of a subset of these genes might be more useful than EVR as a predictor for treatment outcome of PEG-IFN-a plus ribavirin therapy for HCV genotype 1 patients. Background and aim: Demethylating agents, such as 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (DAC) have been used for treatment of cancer. Its clinical utility, however, is limited due to several side effects. Recently, procaine (PCA) and procainamide (PCAA), which have been widely utilized for clinical use, were revealed to be demethylating agent. In this study, we investigated whether PCA had growth-inhibitory effect on human hepatoma cells. Materials and Methods: Six human hepatoma cell lines (HLE, HuH7, HepG2, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, HuH6) and primary human hepatocytes were treated with 1mM of PCA or 1microM of DAC or 1mM of PCAA together with or without 0.67 microM of trichostatin A (TSA) for 96h and the viability of the cells was measured by MTS assay. Nude mice bearing xenograft were treated with weekly intravenous injection of PCA (low dose: 0.5 mg or high dose: 1 mg) or DAC (17.5 microg) or PCAA (1mg) or saline as a control for 8 weeks. Results: The viability of HLE, HuH7 and HuH6 cells was significantly decreased by the treatment with PCA (77.4%, 70.1% and 86.9% compared to control, respectively)(p\u03fd0.0001). In these cells, the combination treatment with TSA and PCA exhibited stronger growth-inhibitory effect compared with TSA alone (66.0%, 83.3% and 76.9% compared to control, respectively) (p\u03fd0.0001). In contrast, 2mg of PCA treatment or combination treatment of PCA and TSA did not induce the reduction of viability of primary human hepatocytes. High dose of PCA treatment resulted in significant tumor reduction (57.7 \u1b80} 8.8 %, relative to the tumor volume before the treatment) in xenograft bearing mice compared to that of the other treatments, such as low dose of PCA, DAC, PCAA treatment (76.2 \u1b80} 5.2 %, 77.5 \u1b80} 9.6 %, 62.3 \u1b80} 8.8 %, relative to the tumor volume before the treatment, respectively) (p\u03fd0.0001). Conclusion: PCA exhibited growth-inhibitory effect on human hepatoma cells without interfering with primary human hepatocytes. Growth-inhibitory effect of PCA might be partially due to restoration of tumor suppressor genes inactivated through DNA hypermethylation. PCA may be a safe candidate for future therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma based on epigenomics.",

            "text": "Background: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic factor that promotes mitogenesis, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptosis of a wide spectrum of tissues, which suggests a very effective regenerative factor. On the other hand HGF has \"scattering\" function which promotes cancer cell invasion and metastases. Recently HGF-MSP chimera (Metron Factor-1, MF-1) was engineered to have favorable effects of HGF, being separated from the adverse effect of invasiveness (Nature Biotech, 2002). MF-1 binds to both Met and Ron (MSP receptor), eliciting a biological signal through Met-Ron heterodimerization. Aims: We examined biological effects of MF-1 in vitro and in vivo, and try to determine whether MF-1 can be a useful and safe regenerative factor for livers. Methods: MF-1 protein, produced in MDA-MB 435 cells, was purified by two-step affinity chromatography. For in vitro study hepatocytes were exposed to MF-1 or HGF (10-100 ng/ml), and mitogenesis was examined by 3 H-thymidine incorporation, Fas-mediated apoptosis by Cell Death Detection ELISA, receptor activation, signal transduction and cell cycles by Western blotting, respectively. Matrigel invasion assay was performed using human HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-1. For in vivo study, acute CCl 4 liver injury was induced in Balb/c mice together with the treatment of MF-1 intravenously or saline as control, and the livers were analyzed. Results: Hepatocytes expressed both c-Met and RON, and phospholylated AKT and ERK1/2 were detected at 10 min, peaked at 30 min and decreased gradually after the treatments with MF-1 (50ng/ml) and HGF (50ng/ml). The time course and relative induction folds of both treatments were almost same. 3 H-thymidine incorporation was increased with 2.4 folds by MF-1 and 3.3 folds by HGF comparing to that of control. Cyclin D1 and Cdk4 expressions were increased in the same manner by treatments of both factors. Concerning anti-apoptotic function, MF-1 suppressed Fas-mediated apoptosis by 78%, while HGF suppressed by 41 %. Moreover MF-1 didn't affect HepG2 cell invasion through Matrigel, while HGF promoted significantly (417 vs. 637, p\u03fd0.05). In vivo study, serum ALT levels in acute liver injury showed significant suppression by MF-1 treatment compared to the control group (3465 IU/L vs. 1832 at 2 day, 753 vs. 339 at 3 day, p\u03fd0.005). TUNNEL-positive hepatocytes were significantly fewer in MF-1 treated group. Conclusion: MF-1 has favorable functions of proliferation and anti-apoptosis on hepatocytes, and no adverse effect of invasiveness on HCC cells. These results suggested MF-1 can be a useful and safe growth factor for liver regeneration. Introduction: Loss of susceptibility to apoptosis is a central step in carcinogenesis. Since failure to induce apoptosis triggered by membrane receptors has been described in several tumors, sensitization of tumor cells to apoptosis may have therapeutic relevance. Src is a well characterized oncogene which is overexpressed in many tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma. Even though its pathophysiological role has been related to various aspects of carcinogenesis, including invasivity and angiogenesis, its function remains still largely elusive.",

To assess the effect of Src inhibition in non-tumour cells, in vitro stimulation of primary hepatocytes with and without concomitant downregulation of Src activity has been performed. Results: Inhibiton of Src activity by PP2 increased CD95-and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon carcinoma and hepatoma cell lines independently of p53 function. In the Chang hepatoblastoma cell line administration of the Src inhibitor PP2 caused 25% apoptosis.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells able to prime T-cells against tumor-associated antigens, but their potential to induce HCC regression is limited. IL-12 is an essential factor for induction of cellular immune responses. In this study, DCs pulsed with tumor lysate and subsequently transduced with an adenovirus (Ad) encoding murine IL-12 enhanced inhibition of HCC-growth in mice. Methods: Two adenoviruses were generated: Ad-GFP (encoding green fluorescence protein) and Ad-mIL-12 (encoding murine IL-12). DCs were obtained from bone marrow of C3H-HeNcrl mice and cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4. DCs were pulsed with tumor lysate on day 5 and infected with adenoviruses (MOI 500) on day 6. Transgene expression of Ad-GFP and expression of CD80, CD86 and CD40 were assayed by flow cytometry. IL-12expression was detected by ELISA. DCs were injected in the left flank of mice s.c. twice at weekly intervals. One week after the last vaccination, a hepatocellular tumor was induced by inoculation of 106 Hepa129-cells s.c. into the right flank of mice. Results: 48h after transduction of DCs with Ad-GFP \u03fe40% of cells expressed GFP. Ad-IL-12-transduced DCs showed a dose-dependent IL-12-secretion in the supernatant which could be detected already at MOI 100. Expression of DC maturation markers CD80, CD86 or CD40 was not reduced by adenoviral transduction. DCs pulsed with tumor lysate and transduced with Ad-IL-12 could inhibit significantly (p\u03ed0,0286) hepatocellular tumor volume in vaccinated mice as compared to control mice, which were treated with tumor lysate pulsed and Ad-GFP-transduced DCs. On day 19 the mean tumor volume was 361.5\u03e9/-91.3 mm3 in IL-12-DCvaccinated vs. 992.4\u03e9/-250.5 mm3 in control mice. Mice treated with IL-12-transduced DCs displayed stronger protection to tumor challenge than control mice. All treated animals were tumorfree for one week vs. only 25% of control mice. Mean survival of IL-12-DC-treated mice was significantly prolonged (32.5\u03e9/-1.4 days vs 21.2\u03e9/-1.0 days, p\u03ed0,0007) after challenge with Hepa129cells. Conclusions: Our data show that transduction of tumor lysate pulsed-DCs with Ad-IL-12 yields high IL-12-expression. S.c. vaccination with these bio-engeneered DCs can significantly inhibit hepatocellular tumor growth in mice after s.c. challenge with Hepa129-cells. Background: AFP is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed in most HCC. It may be useful as a target-molecule for immunotherapy of HCC. However, breaking immune tolerance to selfantigens is difficult. Few recent studies demonstrate that use of xenoantigens of homologous TAA can induce a potent immune response to tumor-associated self-antigens. Human (h)AFP and murine (m)AFP are highly conserved and display high homology. In this study, we transduced DCs of healthy human donors with adenovirus encoding hAFP or mAFP to stimulate immunologic effector cells against hAFP-expressing hepatocarcinoma-cells. Methods: Three recombinant adenoviruses were generated: Ad-GFP (encoding green fluorescence protein), Ad-hAFP (encoding hAFP) and Ad-mAFP (encoding mAFP). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from healthy donors (n\u03ed3) by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation to obtain DC and lymphocytes. DCs were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 and were infected with adenoviruses at MOI 200 on day 6. Efficiency of adenoviral transduction was assayed by flow cytometry. Lymphocytes were stimulated with mab CD3, IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-1b and cocultured with transduced DCs. Ability to lyse hAFP-expressing Huh7-cells was determined in a 51Cr-release assay. Results: 48h after transduction of DCs with Ad-GFP, 60 to 80% of transduced cells expressed GFP. The transgene expression of hAFP measured in the supernatant was \u03fe200ng/ml and \u03fe1500ng/ml 48h and 8 days, respectively, after transduction with Ad-hAFP. The transgene expression of mAFP in DCs could be detected by Western blot already at MOI 100. Adenovirally transduced DCs displayed a mature phenotype 13 days after generation, as judged by decreasing coexpression of CD14 and CD1d and increasing expression of typical molecules such as CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR. Using Ad-mAFP-transduced DCs, we found that the induced cytotoxicity of effector cells against Huh7-cells was significantly (p\u03fd0.04) higher than the induced cytotoxicity of Ad-hAFP-transduced DCs. Conclusions: Our data show that breaking immune tolerance against hAFP can be increased by using the homologous xenoantigen mAFP in vitro. We suppose the more immunogenic epitopes of mAFP enhance the stimulatory capacity of human DCs against hAFP-expressing HCC-cells. This approach may serve as a novel immunotherapy for HCC. Further investigations of single epitopes of mAFP cross-reacting with hAFP-epitopes are needed. ray analysis to examine the global changes in gene expression that accompany the differentiation of HBC-3 hepatoblast cells in response to Matrigel, 3.5% DMSO or 5mM sodium butyrate. Matrigel was used to induce cholangiocyte differentiation. DMSO or sodium butyrate was used to induce hepatocyte differentiation. We have used 27,000 spot cDNA arrays for transcriptional profiling to identify pathways of gene regulation that are specific to hepatocyte or cholangiocyte differentiation. Using this analysis we have identified 522 genes that are significantly up regulated specifically during Matrigel induced differentiation. Additionally, 120 genes were significantly up regulated during both DMSO and sodium butyrate but not during Matrigel treatment. Further analysis of these gene lists revealed that there are significant differences in the expression of genes involved in three key signaling pathways, the Wnt/beta-catenin, TGFbeta/BMP and Notch signaling pathways. The differential regulation of these pathways during cholangiocyte and hepatocyte differentiation was confirmed using western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplamic fractions of cells treated with either Matrigel or DMSO suggesting that the interaction of these signaling pathways may be important for determining the fate of hepatoblasts within the developing liver. Notch signaling is known to play a role in bile duct development. To investigate whether the TGFbeta/BMP pathway plays a role in vivo we immunostained sections of liver from day 16 and 18 of gestation embryos and 1 day old pups. Nuclear staining with Smad 5 was found in hepatoblasts surrounding the developing vasculature within the e16 and e18 day liver. However, hepatoblasts that were not surrounding the vasculature did not have Smad 5 staining suggesting that the TGFbeta/BMP pathway plays a role in cholangiocyte differentiation in vivo. On going studies will determine the interplay of these three pathways in bipotent hepatoblast differentiation.",

Our aim was to characterize the sequential induction of HGF/c-met target genes in mouse primary hepatocytes, and to detect the effects of c-met deletion on hepatocyte gene expression. We used oligonucleotide microarrays, containing 21997 unique probes, to identify HGF/c-met target genes in wild-type and c-met knock-out (KO) mouse primary hepatocytes. Previously, we have generated a c-met conditional KO mouse using the Cre-loxP system, where the Cre recombinase is controlled by albumin promoter inactivated c-met in postnatal hepatocytes. Serum-starved wild-type or c-met KO hepatocytes were treated in triplicate experiments with recombinant HGF for 0.5, 2, 12 and 24 hours respectively. Total RNA from each experiment was used in reverse-fluor hybridizations. Using the SAM algorithm (1.7-fold difference, \u03fd10% FDR), 426 HGF/c-met regulated genes showing significantly different expression levels between Cre-control and c-met KO hepatocytes were identified. Direct HGF/c-met target genes were verified in samples treated with the translation blocker cycloheximide. In addition to previously described HGF target genes, such as osteopontin, Hmga1 or Egr1, in treated control samples we also detected induction of genes involved in cell proliferation (CDK4, G0/G1 switch) integrin-mediated cell motility (integrin alpha 3, beta 1, fibronectin) and cytoskeletal organization (Cap1, tubulin-b, myosin IC). As expected c-met null hepatocytes did not respond to HGF treatment, but showed persistently higher expression of metabolic stress response genes including the Nrf2 transcription factor and its target genes Gsta-1,-2,-4, and GCLC. Pi3kr1 regulator of PI3kinase also showed continuously higher expression in c-met knock-out cells. With 155 homologous c-met regulated genes, cross-species cluster analysis of expression profiles from mouse primary hepatocytes and from 113 human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), disclosed forty seven HCCs with enhanced activation of HGF/c-met signaling. Patients with tumors showing high expression of c-met targets had significantly (p\u03fd0.0001) worse survival rate (40 deaths out of 47) compared to other HCC patients (34 deaths out of 66). In conclusion, besides regulating cell motility and proliferation, HGF/c-met may also be involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis of hepatocytes. Our data also suggest that specific expression profiles could be useful to identify activation of signaling pathways that play crucial roles in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

            "text": "The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Pal Kaposi-Novak We have previously reported that amphiregulin (AR), a ligand of the EGF-receptor which is not expressed in healthy liver tissue, is induced during acute and chronic liver damage including human liver cirrhosis. Our data indicated that AR induction is likely part of the endogenous adaptive response of the liver to injury, aimed at the restoration of hepatocellular mass and the prevention of cell death. However, the establishment of a proliferative tissue microenvironment by elevated expression of growth factors such as AR, can contribute to the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis. We have evaluated the contribution of AR to different traits related to the neoplastic phenotype of HCC. AR gene expression was analyzed in samples of human HCC tissue (n\u03ed19) by real time PCR, and found to be significantly elevated in 73% of the cases. Interestingly, the expression of the metalloproteinase ADAM17/TACE, involved in AR shedding from the cell surface, was also upregulated in human HCC and in cirrhotic liver when compared to healthy controls. These findings support the existence of a putative autocrine/paracrine loop involving AR in chronic liver injury and HCC. The functional relevance of such autocrine mechanism was addressed in human HCC cell lines. We first observed that HCC cells (PLC, Hep3B, HuH7 and HepG2) express and release AR to their conditioned media, and that AR production is enhanced in the absence of serum. Furthermore, interference with the release of AR, or incubation with AR neutralizing antibodies, resulted in reduced EGFR signaling and HCC cell growth in serum-free conditions. Nevertheless, the most compelling evidence supporting the biological significance of ARmediated autocriny in HCC was obtained when AR expression was silenced by AR-specific si-RNAs. Indeed, downregulation of AR gene expression significantly reduced HCC cell growth, and greatly enhanced the efficacy of the antitumor drug doxorubicine on HCC cell apoptosis. In conclusion, the upregulation of AR, and its processing enzyme ADAM17/TACE, in the preneoplastic cirrhotic liver suggest that AR can be a novel player in the continuous process of hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, our data indicate that AR is also involved in the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype of HCC cells, and thus constitutes a novel therapeutic target in liver cancer. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent antitumoral cytokine, but it can be toxic at high doses. In order to minimize its side effects we have generated a plasmid vector able to direct expression of murine IL-12 in a liver-specific and doxycycline (Dox)-inducible manner. The plasmid was transferred to mice by the hydrodynamics-based procedure and the antitumor effect of IL-12 was evaluated in a transgenic L-PK/c-myc mouse model of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These animals over-express the c-myc oncogene under the control of the liver-specific pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter and develop tumors in 6-8 months that resemble human HCC in terms of biology and gene expression profile. After several rounds of IL-12 induction with Dox (2 mg/ml given in drinking water) for 5-10 days along six months, a clear inhibition of tumor growth and increased survival was observed in treated mice (n\u03ed10) compared to controls (n\u03ed9). The effect of IL-12 was also evaluated in histology samples and by quantification of AFP and VEGF mRNA levels in tumoral and non-tumoral tissues. In order to improve the non-invasive detection of HCC in the L-PK/c-myc mice we have tested different PET tracers (18FDG, 18FDOPA and 11C-Choline). Animals were examined in a Philips Mosaic microPET scanner. 11C-Choline was able to detect 58% tumor nodules, while 18FDG detected 55% of the tumor lesions (similar results to those observed in human HCC). 18FDOPA allow the detection only of 1 out of 3 lesions. The combined analysis of 18FDG and 11C-Choline given separately allowed detection of 75% tumor lesions. In any case, the size of the tumor did not determine detection, since small lesions (5x3 mm) could be detected while bigger lesions (up to 15x12 mm) were not always seen. Both ex vivo PET imaging of extracted organs and gamma counter data confirmed the in vivo images. We conclude that a gene therapy strategy based on the intrahepatic administration of IL-12 from a plasmid vector can improve the prognosis of a human-like mice model of well-differentiated HCC and that the combined analysis of 11C-Choline and 18FDG images may increase the possibilities of properly diagnose HCC lesions.",

These levels are thought to be responsible for the activation of TNF-\u2423 mediated pro-inflammatory pathways. BPI is a cationic protein with bactericidal and endotoxin binding capacity that is largely produced by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Endotoxin neutralization occurs because BPI competitively antagonizes the binding of LPS to LBP. Objectives: To evaluate the functional state of the anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by BPI in cirrhotic patients. Patients and Methods: Forty-two cirrhotic patients with diverse etiologies (alcoholic, n\u03ed28; viral, n\u03ed4; mixed, n\u03ed4; others, n\u03ed 6) and classified according Child Pugh stage (8 Child A, 20 Child B and 14 Child C) were enrolled. Patients with history of recent infection were excluded. Ten healthy subjects served as controls. Plasmatic BPI, LBP and TNF-\u2423 levels were measured using immunometric assays. An adaptation of the LAL assay was used to determine the endotoxin (LPS) plasma level. BPI mRNA expression in PMN was quantified by real-time PCR. Results: In the cirrhotic patients we have observed an increase in BPI mRNA and BPI plasmatic level compare to control subjects (p\u03fd0.05). There was also a significant difference when comparing Child C stage (mRNA: 10.51 \u03e9 12.9; BPI: 23.66 \u03e9 29.07 ng/mL) with Child A (3.95 \u03e9 2.5; 8.35 \u03e9 7.08) p\u03fd0.05. Moreover, Child B-C patients showed higher plasma levels of LPS (0.71 \u03e9 0.45ug/ml) and LBP (12.84 \u03e9 6.31ug/ml) than Child A patients ( 0,58 \u03e9 0,6 UA/ml; 9,88 \u03e9 4,12 ug/ml), although this difference was not statistically significant. An increase of plasmatic TNF-\u2423 levels was observed in Child C patients (10.29 \u03e9 6.5 ng/mL) respect to Child A (6.29 \u03e9 4.6). A significant correlation between BPI and LPS plasma levels and between BPI and TNF-\u2423 level was observed (p\u03fd 0.05). Conclusions: 1. Both, mRNA BPI expression in PMN and BPI protein levels in plasma are increased in cirrhotic patients, particularly in those with the worst functional impairment degree (Child C). 2. The amount of BPI in plasma correlates positively with the levels of endotoxin and TNF-\u2423. These results suggest that the cirrhotic patients show an activation of the anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by the BPI, which possibly plays a regulatory role antagonizing the pro-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by TNF-\u2423.",

            "text": "The Background: Based on our early in vivo studies that defined the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) as an indicator of liver cell terminal differentiation we sought a tissue-culture model that could be experimentally manipulated. The Aim of this study was to uncover the molecular elements that regulate ASGR expression during hepatocellular differentiation. We performed the studies in the human cell line, HuH-7. The simple experimental paradigm of HuH-7 mimics the importance of cell density as a regulatory element seen in fetal hepatocytes during differentiation and can be rigorously controlled. Methods and Results: The expression of \u2423-fetoprotein decreased and albumin increased while the level of GAPDH remained unchanged as HuH-7 cells approached confluence. As we previously demonstrated in developing mouse liver, ASGR binding activity and the steady state level of receptor protein increased as the cells approach a more differentiated state. Metabolic labelling of HuH-7 cells confirmed that the increase in ASGR was the direct result of increased receptor synthesis. Total RNA was isolated from cells at high and low density for Northern blot analysis and probed with an ASGR H 2 b subunit specific cDNA sequence. The observed increase in ASGR expression in the absence of a concomitant increase in transcript abundance indicated that ASGR expression was regulated at a posttranscriptional level. To determine the posttranscriptional mode of regulation, membrane-bound polysomal RNA was isolated and probed with the H 2 b specific sequence. The absence of ASGR mRNA in the membrane fraction in proliferating cells strongly indicated that repressed expression of the receptor was regulated at the translational level. By inserting the ASGR 5' untranslated region (UTR) between the SV40 promoter and the firefly luciferase AUG start site of a reported plasmid (pCBG99), we demonstrated that the regulated expression of luciferase activity in transfected HuH-7 cells was dependent upon the state of HuH-7 differentiation. Adaptation of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay provided the means to directly compare the specific activity of trans-acting factor in cytosol isolated from cells at different proliferative states. The observed increase in the specific activity of trans-acting factor in quiescent HuH-7 suggests an activation pathway was responsible for de-repression of ASGR translation during hepatocellular differentiation. Conclusion: Taken together, the results obtained from cell culture and in vitro experiments provide support for the notion that protein interaction with the ASGR 5' UTR plays an important regulatory role in differentiation-dependent translation.",

Extensive analyses of the transcriptional regulation of ASBT have been performed. Previous studies have indicated that transcriptional regulation alone cannot fully explain the ontogenic regulation of the rat ASBT (J. Clin. Invest. 1995, 95:745; Am. J. Physiol. 1996, 271:G377). The following studies focused on elements in ASBT that might influence RNA stability. Methods: Full-length (3.1 kb), 1.7 kb and 0.3kb of rASBT 3' untranslated region RNA (3'UTR), all of which contained the poly(A) signal, were subcloned downstream of an SV-40 promoter driven luciferase reporter (pGL3) and also downstream of a c-fos promoter driven \u2424-globin (pBBB) gene reporter (Genes Dev. 1991, 5:221). Rat IEC-6 cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs followed by luciferase assays, or with the pBBB expression constructs to examine the \u2424-globin mRNA half-life by Northern blot analysis. Serum withdrawal was used to terminate transcription of the pBBB-rASBT constructs. Band-shift assays were performed with the IEC-6 cytoplasmic extract and the 3\u0408UTR fragments transcribed in vitro from the pSPT-rASBT/3\u04087UTR constructs. Results: Appropriate sized mRNA transcripts were identified by Northern blotting using the pGL3 and pBBB systems. The hybrid constructs containing the 0.3kb, 1.7kb and 3.1kb of the 3'UTR expressed 17%, 5% and 1.5%, respectively, of the luciferase activity possessed by the SV-40 driven pGL3 construct harboring no rASBT 3'UTR. Steady-state mRNA levels of these hybrid constructs were similarly effected by the rASBT 3'UTR. \u2424-globin mRNA stability decreased with increasing length of rASBT 3'UTR, as shown by half-lives of 36.5, 2.8, 1.6 and 0.9, hours for the pBBB-rASBT 3'UTR hybrid mRNAs containing none, the 0.3kb, 1.7kb and 3.1kb 3'UTR, respectively. Band-shift assays revealed multiple RNA-protein bands formed with all the three 3'UTR fragments, suggesting that cis-trans interactions at this region may be involved in the regulation of rASBT mRNA decay, as seen in the half-life analysis of the \u2424-globin mRNA chimeras. Conclusion: The 3'UTR of the rASBT gene contains sequences that may have significant effects on mRNA stability. These elements may have a major impact on the regulation of bile acid transport in the ileum, kidney and bile ducts.",

We present here inhibition of Wee1 kinase induced apoptosis in human HCC cell lines through de-phosphorylation of Tyr15 on cdc2, suggesting that molecular targeting of Wee1 kinase can be an exceptional option for eradication of human HCC. Materials and Methods: Materials and Methods\u00b0jHuman HCC cell lines, HuH2, HuH7 and HepG2, were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% of FCS, while TGF-b1 (2ng/ml) treatment was performed in medium containing 0.1%FCS. The cell population at each cell cycle was analyzed by FACS and the protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. To inhibit Wee1 kinase, we adopted either a chemical inhibitor PD (PD166286, kindly gifted Pfizer Pharmatheutical Co.) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cloned into plasmid expression vector, which targeted two different sites of Wee1 kinase mRNA. Roscovitine was used for inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity in TGF-b1-or PD-treated cells. HCC tissue samples surgically resected were stained with an anti-Wee1kinase antibody using DAKO EnVision system. (We obtained informed consent from each patient for using their HCC samples). Results: TGF-b1 induced apoptosis through down-regulation of Wee1 kinase, followed by de-phosphorylation of Tyr 15 on cdc2, and this apoptosis was inhibited by pretreatment with roscovitine. PD treatment also stimulated apoptosis in HuH2, HepG2 and HuH7 in a dose dependent manner resulting in a decrease of cell number on day 7. Pretreatment with roscovitine completely suppressed PD-mediated apoptosis in HuH7 cells. Moreover, HuH7R, which was isolated from HuH7 cells as a resistant clone against TGF-b1mediated apoptosis, exhibited resistant to PD-induced apoptosis.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Gene therapy with immunostimulatory molecules seems to be a promising approach in cancer therapy. Flt3L has evolved as a very potent hematopoetic cytokine augmenting the numbers of Dendritic Cells (DC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells in mice and humans as well as effecting growth and differentiation of progenitor and stem cells. DCs play a major role in antigen presentation and in the induction and regulation of immune responses and are therefore thought to play a major role in the antitumor immunity. In this study we describe a gene-therapeutic approach to stimulate antitumor immunity by a adenoviral mediated transfer of Flt3L. We generated and produced an adenovirus expressing the Flt3L gene (pAdFlt3L) and confirmed expression by Western Blot and ELISA: in vitro infection of a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) with adenoviral vector expressing Flt3L induced high levels of Flt3L in the supernatants as well as in the cell lysates. We injected CT26 cells subcutaneously into the flank of 4-week-old, female BALB/c mice as a model of colon carcinoma liver metastasis. After 13 days tumor nodules were palpable. Flt3L immunotherapy was initiated 13 days after tumor inoculation by injecting 109pAdFlt3L into the tail vein or directly into the tumor. High levels of Flt3L in the serum of pAdFlt3L-treated mice during the first 3 days after i.v. as well as i.t. injection were detected by ELISA with a maximum Flt3L level after 24 hours, but with an approximately 1000 to 10000 fold higher Flt3L level after i.v.-treatment. Interestingly animals with a second infection 7 days after the first infection showed a second peak of Flt3L levels showing the low immunogenicity of the adenoviral vector. Spleen size and weight was strongly augmented in mice treated with pAdFlt3L. Analyzing the specific array of surface markers of DCs by FACS, therapy with Flt3L was shown to cause a remarkable increase of DCs in treated animals. Tumor infiltration by high frequencies of DCs could be detected by H.E. staining and differentiated by anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c staining corresponding with high serum levels of Flt3L in tumor bearing mice. Furthermore we vaccinated a group of mice with CT26-cell lysate and coinjected the Flt3L adenovirus s.c. Mice in the vaccinated group were challenged with the CT26 cell line; while in the control group all mice died, in the vaccination a approximately 100%survival was observed, demonstrating the potential of costimulation with Flt3L. Our results indicate that immunostimulatory antitumor effects are provided by Flt3L adenoviral therapy through stimulation and proliferation of DCs.",

            "text": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent mitogen for hepatocytes. Recent studies have shown that, depending on the physiological conditions, HGF enhances hepatocyte function without stimulating proliferation. However, the mechanisms of dual activity of HGF are unknown. p53, a transcription factor, is recognized traditionally as a cell-growth suppressor because the expression of p53 and the G 1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 WAF1/CIP1 , is closely linked in various cell lines and malignant tissues. Aim: To examine the significance of the relationship between p53 and p21 in the regulation of hepatocyte proliferation stimulated by HGF. Methods and Results: 1) In vivo experiments: Five to six week old male SD rats were subjected to a two-thirds resection of the liver or a sham operation. After the partial hepatectomy, hepatic p53 protein levels were elevated with increased hepatic HGF levels. Following the increase of HGF and p53, an increase of p21 protein levels was not significant. In contrast, after the sham operation, a minor, but significant increase in hepatic HGF and p53 levels was observed followed by a prominent increase of p21 levels. 2) In vitro experiments: Primary rat hepatocytes were seeded at low and high densities. In the presence of HGF, DNA synthesis was increased in a dose related manner in hepatocytes cultured at low density, but not in hepatocytes cultured at high density. Cellular p53 levels increased in the hepatocytes cultured at low and high densities following the addition of HGF. In addition, p21 levels in hepatocytes cultured at high density were increased after HGF addition, and correlated with cellular p53 levels. However, no significant increase of p21 was observed in the low-density culture. When the activity of p53 was suppressed in hepatocytes cultured at high-density in the presence of HGF by pifithrinalpha, an inhibitor of p53, cellular p21 levels were reduced and DNA synthesis was significantly increased. Treatment with p21 antisense oligonucleotide in addition to HGF resulted in a similar increase of DNA synthesis in high-density cultured hepatocytes. Discussion and Conclusions: Our results suggest that p53 expression in rat hepatocytes is stimulated by HGF, and, when p53 induces p21 expression, DNA synthesis by hepatocytes is suppressed by the p21. Previously, we reported that the mitogenic activity of HGF depends on the increased activity of transforming growth factor alpha induced by p53 in proliferating hepatocytes (Hepatology 2002;36:336-44). Taken together, the induction of diverse effector genes by p53, depending on the physiological situation, may regulate the hepatocyte proliferation stimulated by HGF.",

Among the several critical criteria for applying the siRNA silencing technique in clinical treatment, the choice of the targeted sequence within HBV genome by designed siRNA is the important determinant for inhibitory efficacy, and the primary activation forms, e.g. siRNA or shRNA, exerts the influence to the efficacy as well. To efficiently screen the siRNA target sites for anti-HBV replication, we have succeeded to establish the screening protocol using PCR-based HBV siRNA expression cassette (SECs) and has applied it to screen several potential siRNA target site within HBV genome with the HBV viral producing cell line, HepG2.2.15. The results have shown that, among total of four tested siRNA targeting sites including two of them in the different positions on HBsAg gene and another two on HBV preC and HBeAg genes, the siRNA targeted to HBV S gene at 458 to 478 bases position and designed as SECs-S2 has demonstrated the greatest inhibition effects on HBV DNA replication and on both HBsAg and HBeAg productions with the inhibitory rate of 87.49 % and 66.8 %, respectively. The inhibitory effects by SECs-S2 has further showed a dose dependent fashion and up to 10 days of prolonged inhibition period with started at very first day, peaked at second day and maintained at peak inhibitory effects until day 7-day 8 of post transfection on the HBV viral producing HepG2.2.15 cells. On the other hands, the variability of the tested cells were maintained in constant and SECs-S2 siRNA cassette didn't shown any effects to the lucuferase activity in the cotransfection experiment with luciferase expression vector and SECs-S2 siRNA cassette. These data indicated that SECs-S2 siRNA specifically targeted to HBV genome RNA. In conclusion of the presented study, PCR-based HBV siRNA expression cassette is an efficient approach that can be used to optimize the targeting sites for siRNA silencing. The site at 458 to 478 bases pair of HBsAg gene exposes the great potential as siRNA -base therapeutics target for anti-HBV.",

Previous studies have shown that the administration of recombinant insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induced hepatoprotective effects and corrected hypogonadism in experimental cirrhosis. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of a Simian Virus 40 vector (rSV40) encoding IGF-I (rSVIGF-I) to prevent cirrhosis progression. Mice injected intraportally with rSV40 encoding luciferase (rSVLuc) showed hepatic expression of the transgene for more than 7 months. Luciferase expression was low but increased significantly in CCl4-damaged livers and upon IGF-I administration, thus favouring transgene expression from vectors encoding this hormone. Healthy male Wistar rats were treated by intraportal injection of rSVIGF and liver cirrhosis was induced by CCl4 inhalation during 36 weeks. At the end of the study the hepatic levels of IGF-I mRNA and of IGFBP3 protein (an IGF-I binding protein whose synthesis is induced by IGF-I) were higher in rSVIGF-I-treated rats than in control cirrhotic animals. Cirrhotic rats treated with rSVIGF-I had reduced serum bilirubin, serum transaminases and liver fibrosis scores as well as increased intrahepatic expression of Hepatocyte Growth Factor as compared to control cirrhotic animals. Furthermore, cirrhotic animals showed testis atrophy and altered spermatogenesis while both testicular size and histology were normal in those cirrhotic rats that received rSVIGF-I therapy.

We used a HCV cell-based system to examine the interaction of HCV infection and host immunity. We also used a microarray-based approach to compare mRNA expression patterns during HCV expression to (1) define how HCV regulates host gene expression; and (2) assess which HCV viral proteins are responsible for specific gene regulation. Methods: Using transcriptional profiling microarray (70-mer, Human Operon Set version 1.1 and CodeLink, GE), mRNA expression patterns were profiled after transfection Huh-T7 cell (Huh7 cells stably expressing T7 polymerase) with pH77, a full length infectious genotype 1 HCV construct under the control of the T7 promoter. These patterns were compared with those produced by pGEM (empty vector) transfection of Huh-T7 cells. Selected upregulated genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition, subgenomic constructs corresponding to the HCV structural and each of the non-structural proteins were transiently transfected into Huh-T7 cells to evaluate which HCV proteins were associated with upregulation of identified host genes. As an independent means of validating the findings, a full length HCV 1b replicon (Huh7-2-3) was also utilized. Results: Of the 13,971 genes profiled in the Human Operon set, 78 were up-regulated and 56 were down-regulated at least two-fold by HCV expression. These 134 genes include cell signaling, immune defense, cytokine, cytoskeletal, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell metabolism genes. Among these genes, TGF-b1 was up-regulated in both microarray systems. Because of its pivotal role in fibrogenesis, and its potentially important role in host immune regulation, TGF-b1 was further characterized. Realtime PCR analysis confirmed TGF-b1 upregulation by pH77. TGF-b1 was also upregulated (4.7 fold) by Huh7-2-3 cells compared to parental Huh7 cells. HCV subgenomic analysis revealed that in addition to the full-length HCV construct pH77, HCV structural proteins (core-E1-E2), core, and NS5A produced comparable degrees of upregulation of TGF-b1 gene expression. In contrast, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5B and the unrelated protein GFP had no effect on TGF-b1 expression. Conclusions: We conclude that HCV expression significantly stimulates TGF-b1 gene expression. In particular, HCV core and NS5A each upregulate TGF-b1. The up-regulation of TGF-b1 expression in an independent replicon system suggests that this finding is broadly applicable across multiple models of HCV replication and that viral protein expression may directly contribute to hepatic fibrogenesis.

When VT-GGCX was introduced into HLE and SKHep1, these transfected cells began to produce DCP. Conclusion: Novel splicing variant GGCX was expressed in HCC cell lines, and its expression was correlated with DCP-production. VT-GGCX cDNA introduction resulted in DCP production in DCP-negative HCC cell lines. These results imply that splicing variant GGCX may play a critical role in GGCX activity and may be a clue of elucidation of DCP production mechanism.",

            "text": "Prolonged hepatic hypoxia is a common underlying event in most chronic liver diseases. The metabolic response for adaptation in chronic liver hypoxia is poorly understood. Chronic hypoxia, results in an increase in nutrient supply which provides cells with energy for survival. This is accomplished by increase uptake of glucose through the plasma membrane via glucose transporter 1, 2 and 3. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate the adaptive response to hypoxia. These genes include erythropoietin, VEGF and glycolytic enzymes. In the present study, we determined the hepatic expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in hypoxia and of downstream genes that carry the hypoxic response element (HRE) related to glucose metabolism such GLUT-1 and 3. GLUT-2 was evaluated but it is a NON-HRE gene. Adult male Spragne-Dawley (SD) (n \u03ed 6-8) rats were kept in a hypoxic chamber at 10% O2 level (hypoxic groups) and a control group kept at 21% O2 level (normoxic groups) for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Animals were killed by decapitation at the appropriate time points and blood and liver samples were collected. Samples from normoxic and hypoxic rats were analyzed for different genes and proteins using histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, Western Blotting (WB) and EMSA and serum ALT, hematocrit, lipid peroxides (total 8-isoprostane) were also measured. Our results showed that there was a significant increase in the hematocrit from day 7 to day 28 in the hypoxic rats. The liver morphology, serum ALT and total 8-isoprostane levels were normal in both groups. Nitrotyrosine protein levels were not significantly increased at any of the time-points. Results from immunohistochemistry showed that HIF-1 alpha was expressed at the nuclei of the sinusoidal liver cells and hepatocytes. GLUT-1 was expressed by the endothelial cells in the pericentral lobular veins. GLUT-2 and GLUT-3 were expressed by the hepatocytes in the liver parenchyma. WB analysis showed that the GLUT 1-3 proteins were upregulated from day 7 to day 28 (p \u03fd 0.05). HIF-1 alpha (EMSA) was upregulated in hypoxic liver when compared to the normoxic control from day 7 to day 28 (p \u03fd 0.01). Our data suggest that the metabolic adaptive ability of the liver in chronic hypoxia triggers compensatory mechanisms for survival by increasing the availability of glucose through upregulation of GLUT 1-3 mediated at least in part, by HIF-1 alpha. This adaptive response probably prevents the increase in oxidant stress and liver damage.",

Aims: To identify predictors of SVR, RVR and relapse following short treatment. Patients: Data from two sets of patients (from Italy and Norway) were pooled (n\u03ed 403); patients had been treated with PegIFN \u2423-2b (1.0, n\u03ed281 or 1.5 g/kg, n\u03ed122) and ribavirin (800-1200 mg) for 12-14 or 24 weeks, depending on negative or positive HCV-RNA at week 4. Patients were \u03fd45 yrs (51%), 58% were males, infected with HCV-2 (60 %), 53% had low (\u03fd600,000 IU/ml) viremia, 78% had absence of bridgingfibrosis/cirrhosis. and 57% moderate/severe steatosis. Methods: Primary end point was undetectable HCV-RNA 24 weeks after therapy (SVR). Possible predictors of SVR, RVR and relapse following short treatment were analyzed by logistic regression models. Results: SVR was obtained in 313/403 patients (78%). SVR differed between cases with or without RVR (85% vs 62%, P\u03fd.0001), mild or bridging fibrosis/ cirrhosis (82% vs 67%, P\u03ed.004), absent/mild or moderate/severe steatosis (84% vs 72%, P\u03ed.014), HCV-2 or -3 (81% vs 73%, P\u03ed.05) low or high viremia (80% vs 67%, P\u03ed.05). In a logistic regression model, RVR (OR 2.48, CI 1.12 -5.0), mild fibrosis (OR 2.39, CI 1.12 -5.1), and HCV-2 (OR 2.07, CI 1.03 -4.1) were independent predictors of SVR. RVR was obtained in 274/403 (68%) patients, 163/242 (67%) HCV-2, and 111/161 (69%) HCV-3. Patients with RVR had, as compared to those without RVR, more frequently low grade steatosis (72% vs 64%, P\u03ed.011), mild fibrosis (70% vs 63%, P\u03ed.03), and high PegIFN dose (78% vs 64%, P\u03ed.005); RVR was independent of viral load. In a logistic regression model, absence of severe fibrosis independently predicted RVR (OR 0.35, CI 0.18 -0.68). In RVR patients, SVR was achieved in 85% of both HCV-2 and HCV-3. Virologic relapse was observed in 29/274 RVR patients (10.6%), and was more frequently observed among those with low ALT levels (14% vs 5%, P\u03ed.033), high viremia (14% vs 6%, P\u03ed.018), and severe fibrosis (18% vs 8%, P\u03ed.011). Peg-IFN dose, steatosis and genotype were not associated with risk of relapse. Severe fibrosis (OR 2.75, CI 1.19-6.4) and low ALT (OR 0.08, CI 0.01 -0.63) were independent predictors of relapse. Conclusion: In HCV-2 or -3, the HCVRNA status after 4 weeks of therapy may guide treatment duration. Short treatment duration is effective in both HCV-2 and -3 patients with RVR, but those with severe fibrosis are less likely to experience both RVR and SVR, and more frequently relapse off therapy.",

Patients and Methods: From Sept 2003 to May 2004, 78 consecutive pts, admitted for ascites (72%), variceal bleeding (16%), encephalopathy (18%), na\u00efve to therapy, were offered treatment: 40 pts agreed and those who did not (n\u03ed38) served as controls. Therapy was started when pts were compensated. Treated and control pts presented, respectively, in Child-Pugh (CP) class A (13% and 5%), B (60% and 61%) and C (27% and 34%); their respective mean ages were 63 \u03ee 9 vs 65 \u03ee 7; HCV-1 was typed in 60% and 79%. The main end point was the effect of therapy on the natural history, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Undetectable HCV-RNA 24 weeks off therapy (SVR) and safety were secondary end points. Results: 3 pts dropped out prematurely for intolerance. Antiviral therapy was associated with 20 adverse events (4 severe infection with death, 12 mild infections, 2 bleedings, and 2 HCC); during the same span of time, 20 events were registered in controls (4 severe infections with death, 7 mild infections, 5 bleedings, and 4 HCC). All but one severe infections occurred in CP class C. SVR rates were achieved in 8/40 pts (20%), including 6/13 HCV-2 (46%) and 2/27 HCV-1 (7%). After 19\u03ee1,3 months of follow up, the mean CP score, as compared to basal value, improved in pts with SVR (8\u03ee1,3 vs 7\u03ee0,8), was unchanged in non responders (7,9\u03ee1,3 vs 8,2\u03ee1,4), and worsened in controls (8,6\u03ee1,5 vs 9,3\u03ee1,7). In the 64 surviving pts without OLT, CP score at follow up, as compared to basal value, decreased by at least 1 point in 6/8 (75%) pts with SVR, in 4/26 (15%) non-responders and 1/30 (3%) controls; was unchanged in 2 SVR pts (25%), 11 non responders (42%) and 9 controls (30%), and increased by at least 1 point in 11 non-responders (42%) and 20 controls (66%) (p\u03ed0.001). At Kaplan-Meier evaluation, the number of decompensated events were significantly reduced during the follow up in pts with SVR, as compared to both unresponsive and control pts (Figure) . Conclusions: In decompensated cirrhotics, combination therapy is poorly tolerated, and unsafe in CP class C. The obtained SVR rates are encouraging for HCV-2, but not for HCV-1 pts. In pts with SVR, therapy positively influences natural history of the disease.",

Methods: 59 subjects were enrolled, 30 in group 1 and 29 in group 2. Treatment lasted 48 weeks if HCV RNA was undetectable at week 24, otherwise drugs were discontinued. SVR was determined at week 72. Safety laboratory tests and adverse events (AE) assessments were done monthly. To date all subjects have completed week 48 and 56 subjects have finished week 72. Results: At baseline the 2 groups were similar in gender (67% men), age (mean \u03ed 44 years), weight (202 lbs men, 152 lbs women), ethnicity (59% Caucasian, 30% African American), high viral load (75%, mean levels: 3.8 and 3.6 million IU/mL for groups 1 and 2) and hemoglobin (mean: 15 g/dL). Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 3 subjects of group 1 and 5 subjects of group 2. The SVR was similar for both groups: 37% for CIFN/RBV and 35% for PEGIFN/RBV. The week 48 and SVR by viral load were: No subject dropped hemoglobin to \u03fd8.5 g/dL. Neutrophils dropped to \u03fd750/uL in 13% and 24% of groups 1 and 2, respectively (p\u03ed 0.29).

AE were flu-like symptoms in 100% and 93%, headache in 63% and 39%, fatigue in 77% and 50%, mood disorders in 67% and 66%. Serious AE were observed in 6 subjects (3 per group) (cellulitis, severe fatigue, psychosis, seizure, dehydration, EtOH recidivism, and pyelonephritis). Conclusion: CIFN/RBV combination therapy elicited a comparable SVR to PEGIFN/RBV in previously untreated subjects with genotype-1 chronic HCV. There were no relapsers among the CIFN/RBV treated group. The AE profile for CIFN/RBV demonstrated less neutropenia and dose reductions.

Thus, induction of strong HCV-specific T cell responses could represent a new therapeutic strategy. Virus like particles (VLP) expressing the HCV structural proteins as well as synthetic peptides representing well-characterized CTL epitopes might serve as an effective therapeutic vaccine. The humanized trimera mouse model was used to study the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates in a preclinical animal model. Irradiated Balb/c mice were transplanted with nod.scid mouse bone marrow and reconstituted with human blood lymphocytes (PBMC) from three HLA A2.1 positive chronic HCV patients. These so-called trimera mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally with VLP expressing the structural proteins core, E1 and E2 or with a mixture of HLA A2 restricted synthetic peptide CTL epitopes from the HCV core, E1, E2 or NS3 region. PBMC were recovered 10 days after vaccination and T cell analysis was performed with tetramer staining or gIFN Elispot assay with recombinant HCV antigens, overlapping HCV peptides or the respective CTL epitopes. HCV specific T cell responses could be detected in trimera mice reconstituted with PBMC from two out of three chronic HCV patients, although such responses were undetectable in donor PBMC. Alternatively, instead of PBMC reconstitution, HCV-infected human liver tissue was implanted under the kidney capsule of the trimera mice. HCV quantification in the trimera serum and HE-staining of implanted liver grafts was performed at different time points.

However, although prolonged NM107 treatment can eradicate BVDV in a cell line persistently infected with ncp BVDV, lower concentrations of NM107 led to selection of resistant virus after 3 to 5 cell passages. Sequencing revealed resistance was due to a S405T amino acid substitution near the start of the B domain motif of the BVDV NS5B polymerase, confirming that the polymerase is the target for NM107. This motif is highly conserved among positive-strand RNA viruses, including HCV, predicting that the equivalent mutation in HCV polymerase is S282T. The NM107-resistant BVDV strains show at least 50-fold reduced susceptibility to NM107, accompanied by decreased replication fitness in vitro: \"small plaque\" phenotype, slow growth kinetics and lower virus titers.

We have previously identified a T cell receptor (TCR) that has relatively high affinity for HLA A2-restricted HCV NS3 1406-1415 peptide. The purpose of this study was to determine whether gene transfer of this TCR into peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal healthy controls could induce HCV-specific reactivity that would respond to wild-type and mutant virus. Methods: TCR alpha\u0192nand beta chain genes from the HCV-specific TCR were cloned and inserted into a retroviral vector capable of delivering the genes into human T cells. The ability of transferred TCR genes to confer HCV reactivity to PBL from 3 healthy donors was evaluated using IFN-gamma production following stimulation with wild type or mutant peptide. Results: TAP-deficient T2 cells were loaded with wild type NS3 1406-1415 peptide (KLVALGINAV), eight different naturally occurring viral mutants (V1408L, A1409T, I1412V, I1412L, I1412N, V1408T and the multiple substituted peptides A1409G/I1412L/ V1408T and V1408S/A1409G/I1412L), or a melanoma control peptide. TCR-transduced PBL (both CD4\u03e9 and CD8\u03e9 T cells) produced statistically significant amounts of IFN-gamma following stimulation with wild type HCV peptide and 7 of the 8 HCV mutant peptides but not with melanoma peptide. Moreover, TCRtransduced PBL recognized endogenously processed peptide. Conclusions: We demonstrate the ability to engineer normal PBLderived T cells to specifically recognize HCV independent of immune status. By providing T cell help as well as effector function, this approach represents a promising immunotherapy. Moreover, the ability of TCR-transduced PBL to recognize mutants suggests this approach might prevent antigenic escape variants.",

Methods: In this randomized, single rising dose, double-blind study, healthy subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive, SCH 503034 oral capsules, (n\u03ed6/group ) 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg or placebo (n\u03ed3/group). Plasma samples were collected at multiple time points to 120h post-dose. Samples were analyzed by validated LC-MS/MS with a LOQ of 0.5 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed using model independent methods. Safety was assessed by clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, physical exams and occurrence of adverse events Results: Fifty-four subjects completed the study, 36 received SCH 503034, 18 received placebo. SCH 503034 was rapidly absorbed following oral administration of capsules (mean Tmax:1-2.25 h across the 6 dosing levels). After attaining Tmax, plasma SCH503034 concentrations declined in a bi-phasic manner, with a mean terminal phase half-life (T 1/2 ) of 7.0 to 15 h. Cmax and AUC increased in a dose-related manner. The safety profiles were similar in subjects receiving SCH 503034 and placebo. Conclusions: SCH 503034 was readily bioavailable when administered as a single dose in an oral capsule formulation and was well tolerated in subjects receiving up to 800 mg orally.",

Here, we have identified a lipophilic long-chain base compound, NA255, from a secondary fungal metabolite, as a novel small molecule HCV replication inhibitor using an HCV subgenomic replicon cell culture system. HCV replicon 1b cellbased assay showed that the replication was suppressed by NA255 in a dose-dependent manner with a mean of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 nM. NA255 had no effect on hostcell viability (IC50\u03fe50,000 nM) and cell cycle progression. We found that NA255 prevents the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, major lipid raft components, thereby inhibiting serine palmitoyltransferase and disrupting the association among HCV nonstructural (NS) viral proteins on the lipid rafts. To determine whether HCV protein could interact directly with sphingolipids, we searched for the sphingolipid-binding domain (SBD) in HCV NS protein. We found that NS5B protein has a SBD in the molecular structure and that the interaction of NS5B with sphingolipids could be involved in HCV replicon replication. Thus, NA255 is a potent anti-HCV replication inhibitor that targets host lipid raft, suggesting that inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of HCV infection.

Additionally, NS3-mediated cleavage of host factors integral to Interferon Response Factor-3 signaling may result in abrogated cellular responses to IFN. Thus, blockage of NS3 activity is expected to inhibit HCV replication by direct suppression of viral production and restoration of host IFN responsiveness. SCH 503034, reversibly binds the HCV NS3 protease and specifically inhibits its activity. Methods: SCH 503034 NS3 binding activity was determined spectrophotometrically. Anti-viral potency was assayed in HCV replicon cells exposed to increasing amounts of SCH 503034 for various times up to 15d. HCV replicon RNA and protein expression were monitored by Northern and Western analysis, respectively and replicon copy number was determined by qRT-PCR multiplex reaction. The effect of SCH 503034 on response to IFN was evaluated in replicon cells incubated with increasing amounts of SCH 503034 and IFN for 72h. Toxicity, was assessed by cell viability and doubling time. Results: SCH 503034 exhibited time-dependent inhibition of single chain NS3 with a binding constant (K i *) equal to \u03f314 nM. SCH 503034 inhibition of replicon synthesis was dose-related. The IC 50 and IC 90 for suppression of replicon synthesis following 72-h exposure were \u03f3200 nM and 400 nM, respectively. Exposure of replicon cells to SCH 503034 over 15d resulted in log reductions in replicon RNA of \u03f3 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0 at 1.2, 6 and 12 x IC 90 , respectively. Isobologram analysis revealed that SCH 503034 \u03e9 IFN-\u2423 was more effective than the line of additivity, though the difference was not significant (p\u03fe0.1). No toxicity was seen after exposure of HuH-7 cells to 50M SCH 503034 for 96 h, or primary hepatocytes to 10 x IC 90 for 1 wk. No changes in doubling times or growth rates of HuH-7 cells were seen after a 3-wk at 10 x IC 90 . Conclusions: SCH 503034 exhibited potent anti-viral activity both alone and in combination with IFN-\u2423 in the HCV replicon assay. The combination of SCH 503034 with IFN may lead to enhanced clinical efficacy.",

The success of transplantation, however, is compromised by the re-infection of the graft and this problem has begun to worsen in the last decade. Changes in immunosuppressive therapy may have contributed to this deterioration. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different immunosuppressive compounds on HCV replication and determine the synergy and kinetics of inhibition. Methods: The anti-viral properties of pegylated IFN-alpha 2b (IFN) and immunosuppressive drugs were tested in vitro using an HCV-replication model. Huh-7 hepatoma cells, containing the HCV replicon with a luciferase reporter gene, were cultured for 18 hour with different doses or combinations of drugs. HCV replication was quantified based on luciferase activity, RT-PCR for viral RNA and immunocytochemistry for helicase (NS3) protein. Kinetics of inhibition was determined with the Xenogen IVIS imaging system. Results: Tacrolimus, rapamycin, dexamethason or prednisolon did not inhibit HCV replication, whereas almost complete inhibition (98%) was observed with IFN (10IU/ml). Both cyclosporin A (CsA) (0.5-5.0 ug/ml) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) (2.0-6.0 ug/ ml) blocked HCV replication up to 70%. No cell death was observed with any tested compounds. Proliferation of Huh-7 cells was reduced with MPA, but did not account for the observed inhibition of HCV replication. When CsA and MPA were combined, synergistic inhibition was observed up to 90% at higher doses. Synergistic inhibition was also observed with a combination There was a good correlation between antiviral activity and cyclophilin-binding activity of these compounds. NIM811 was selected for further research because it binds to cyclophilins with similar affinity as CsA but is devoid of significant immunosuppressive activity, as the NIM811-cyclophilin complex does not bind to calcineurin. NIM811 induced a concentration-dependent reduction of HCV RNA in replicon cells with an IC50 of 0.66 \u00ecM at 48 hours, compared to 0.80 \u00ecM for CsA. After a nine-day treatment of replicon cells, a three-log10 reduction of HCV RNA levels was achieved with as low as 1 \u00ecM NIM811. Moreover, NIM811 showed equally potent activity in HCV replicons that were highly resistant to viral protease or polymerase inhibitors. Resistance against this compound appears to be difficult to generate in vitro. In vitro, combinations of NIM811 with other HCV inhibitors produced at least additive antiviral effects. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed a t1/2 of circa 14 hours, with hepatic concentrations 10-fold over serum levels. Toxicology studies showed no safety issue at the dose range predictive of therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, NIM811 has potent anti-HCV activity and is several orders of magnitude less immunosuppressive than CsA in vitro. The fact that it targets a host protein and the demonstration of its uncompromised efficacy in HCV resistant against protease or polymerase inhibitors provide the rationale for combining of NIM811 with other specific antivirals to improve therapeutic efficacy and to suppress emergence of drug-escape mutants.",

VX-950, a potent and specific NS3-4A protease inhibitor, has recently demonstrated significant antiviral activity in a phase 1b trial of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 . Median reductions of 2 to 4 log10 IU per mL in serum HCV RNA concentrations were achieved after 14 days of dosing with VX-950. The degree to which a patient responds to treatment and the rate at which viral rebound is observed could in part be due to genotypic differences in sensitivity to the protease inhibitor. The rapid replication rate of hepatitis C virus, along with the poor fidelity of its polymerase, gives rise to an accumulation of mutations throughout its genome. The degree to which sequence variability in the protease region affects the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme or the binding of an inhibitor is not known. Here, we characterize the extent of sequence diversity within the NS3 protease domain of HCV isolated from 34 patients enrolled in the phase 1b trial, before dosing with VX-950. The NS3 protease domain was amplified by nested RT-PCR, cloned, and sequenced. The consensus sequence for each patient's HCV population was derived from an average of 90 independent cDNA clones. The average intra-patient amino acid quasispecies complexity (Shannon entropy) and diversity (Hamming distance) was low (0.332 \u03ee 0.109 and 0.421 \u03ee 0.195, respectively) and no correlation of quasispecies heterogeneity with HCV RNA serum concentration at baseline was observed. The interpatient (individual consensus compared to genotype 1a or 1b consensus sequence) amino acid diversity was 1% for genotype 1a and 2% for genotype 1b. Modeling analysis predicted that amino acid differences observed between consensus sequences of all these patients were expected to have little or no impact on VX-950 binding. Patient specific protease clones were then expressed and tested for inhibition by the protease inhibitor VX-950. In agreement with the modeling observation, there were no significant differences in the enzymatic IC50 of these proteases derived from different patient isolates. In conclusion, it appears that despite the observed sequence diversity in the HCV NS3 serine protease, patients may be uniformly responsive to treatment with the protease inhibitor VX-950.",

The potential effects of cannabinoids on interferon-mediated suppression of viral replication were not known. Specific Aims: To define the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and methanandamide (MA) a CB receptor agonist on interferonmediated suppression of HCV replication in hepatocytes. Methods: HCV virus replication was measured by negative strand quantitative PCR in a commercially available HCV replicon system (APATH). The effects of increasing doses of MA (0-3 M) and THC (0-1.5 M) on HCV replication was first measured. Next, the effect of MA and THC on \u2423-interferon mediated suppression of HCV replication was measured. The specificity of these effects were tested by pharmacologic blockade of CB1 and CB2 receptors. Next, the effects of MA on interferon-mediated increased on protein kinase R (PKR) and interferon response factor (IRF) mRNA (measured by qPCR), and protein (measured by Western blot) were measured. Results: Compared to controls, MA and THC produced a 40-62% decrease in HCV replication. These effects were most marked after 12 hours of exposure. As expected, IFN (5000 IU/ml) produced a 90% inhibition of HCV replication. MA as well as THC blocked the IFN-mediated inhibition of HCV replication. These effects could be blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 but not by a CB2 antagonist SR144528. MA and THC also blocked the interferon-mediated increase in PKR and IRF mRNA and protein. BILN-2061 and ITMN A and ITMN B showed EC 50 s against the D168V NS3/4 protease of 10 nM and \u03fd2 nM, respectively. In an effort to understand the molecular basis for the \u03f350% response rate to the SoC for chronic HCV, a subgenomic HCV replicon that displayed more than a 28-fold reduced sensitivity to the antiviral effects of IFN \u2423-2a was evolved in vitro. This replicon partially evades interferon responses by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and consequently the downstream expression of a repressor of viral translation (ISG56). ITMN compounds retained their full potency against this interferon \"resistant\" replicon and furthermore restored expression of ISG56.",

Inhibition of HCV gene expression and replication as well as immunotherapeutic concepts aimed at enhancing the cellular immune response against HCV are being explored. One promising new strategy is the use of immunomodulating agents in combination with IFN and/or ribavirin to treat HCV patients. The nontoxic immunomodulator ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-o,o\u0408) tellurate (AS101), first developed by us has been shown to have beneficial effects in diverse preclinical and clinical studies. Most of its activities have been primarily attributed to the direct inhibition of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This immunomodulatory property was found to be crucial for the clinical activities of AS101, demonstrating the protective effects of AS101 in viral-infected mice models. AS101 have also inhibitory effect on different viral catalytic functions such as inhibition of the HIV reverse transcriptase. Phase I clinical trials with advanced cancer patients treated with AS101 showed increased production and secretion of a variety of cytokines, leading to a clear dominance in TH1 responses with a concurrent decrease in the TH2 responses. The aim of our study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of the AS101 on the catalytic activity of HCV NS3 serine protease in order to evaluate its potential as an HCV therapeutic agent. The effect of AS101 on HCV serine protease activity was analyzed in vitro using the fluorometric assay developed in our laboratory. This effect was further confirmed by our novel high-throughput in-vivo genetic screen. This screen is based on the concerted co-expression of a reporter gene and recombinant NS3 in E. coli. The effect of AS101 on HCV in-vivo was determined using a cell-based selectable subgenomic HCV RNA Huh-7 replicon system. In this system HCV RNA replication is monitored in intact cells by the enzymatic assay of placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity secreted. Our study demonstrates that AS101 specifically inhibits NS3 serine protease catalysis in a dose-dependent manner in the assay system examined. It reaches 70.3 \u03ee 9.5% inhibition at AS101 concentration of 10 mg/ml. Moreover, AS101 specifically inhibited HCV replication as determined in Huh-7 replicon system. Our results suggest that HCV NS3 serine protease is a novel target for AS101 action and of the inhibitory effect of AS101 on HCV replication involve repression of HCV NS3 serine protease.",

This regimen results in sustained virologic response in \u03f350% of patients and is associated with significant ribavirin-related toxicity in certain patients. Novel therapeutic regimens with better safety and/or efficacy are the subject of intense interest. Targeted disruption of host cellular processes required for viral replication is being explored as a component of such regimens. Miglitol is an orally available iminosugar inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) \u2423-glucosidases approved for the treatment of non insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes. These same glucosidase enzymes are crucial for the production of functional glycosylated envelop proteins of HCV and other viruses. ER \u2423-glucosidases \"trim\" N-linked glycan moities added to envelop proteins through cellular glycosylation pathways and, therefore, are required for association of envelope proteins with chaperones and for proper folding of envelope proteins. We hypothesized that miglitol may have utility in the treatment of HCV by prohibiting formation of the glyco-envelope of the viral particle and ultimately blocking assembly of infectious viral particles. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of miglitol were examined using bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a surrogate live pestivirus and the bovine cell line MDBK. Antiviral effects of miglitol were determined alone and in combination with IFN alfacon-1, a potent type I IFN approved by regulatory agencies worldwide for the treatment of HCV. Miglitol and IFN alfacon-1 both showed antiviral activity when used alone [half maximal reduction in viral titer (EC 50 ) values were 155 M and 5 pg/mL, respectively]. Using Chuo-Talalay methods, the combination of the two drugs was investigated for additive, antagonistic or synergistic antiviral effects. Combination of IFN alfacon-1 and miglitol yielded combination index (CI) values indicative of synergy at EC 50 , EC 75 and EC 90 (CI \u03ed 0.8, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively) and an isobologram analysis supported synergistic interaction. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that miglitol, a medication with an established safety profile that is indicated for use in the control of type II diabetes, has antiviral activity when used alone and displays synergistic antiviral effects when used in combination with IFN alfacon-1. Thus, the combination of miglitol and a type I IFN such as IFN alfacon-1 may have clinical utility in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Further study is warranted While the mechanism underlying such states in the liver is still uncertain, it is suspected that the mitochondria and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases in HCV infection. Tacrolimus (FK506), widely used in transplantation, has been supposed to have a capacity to protect the mitochondrial respiratory function, while it has recently shown to be ineffective to HCV replication. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not Tacrolimus protects the function of mitochondria and contributes to improvement of lipid and glucose metabolisms in a mouse model for HCV-associated liver disease. Methods: Tacrolimus was administered for three months to HCV core gene transgenic mice, which develop hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and, finally, liver cancer. As a control, nontransgenic littermate mice were also given Tacrolimus. Levels of plasma glucose and serum insulin and lipid profiles in liver tissues were determined before and after Tacrolimus treatment. Results: In the core gene transgenic mice that were treated with Tacrolimus, steatosis was improved and lipid profile was changed to a pattern resembling that in normal mice. Insulin resistance was also improved in the core gene transgenic mice treated with Tacrolimus compared to those without Tacrolimus. Conclusions: Tacrolimus reversed the effect of the core protein in lipid and glucose metabolisms in vivo. This result may provide a new therapeutic aid for chronic hepatitis C, in which metabolic abnormalities in lipid and glucose contribute to liver pathogenesis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of splenic DCs that ingest magnetic beads coated with NS5 antigen to induce HCV cellular immune responses in vivo.",

Splenocytes were incubated for 3 hrs with HCV NS5coated magnetic beads in serum-free medium. The cells were harvested and cells that contained beads were purified by passage over a magnetic column. Non-ingested beads were separated from the purified splenocytes by centrifugation on a 20% Histodenz gradient. The isolated population contained \u03fe80% DCs and was used for immunization (2 x 10 6 cells inoculated in the paw of Balb/c mice). DC expression of the maturation markers CD40, CD80 and CD86 was determined before and after ingestion of NS5-coated beads, showing a significant increase of all maturation markers induced by phagocytosis. The induction of cellular immunity was assessed using a conventional CTL assay, a CFSE-Tcell proliferation assay, intracellular cytokine staining and tumor challenge (with stably NS5 expressing murine myeloma cells). Results: In immunized animals, the CTL activity was increased 3-fold compared to mock immunized mice. Accordingly, tumor challenge with syngenic SP2/0 myeloma cells transfected with and expressing the NS5 gene showed a significant, (\u03fe2-fold reduction) in tumor growth. The number of CD4 \u03e9 IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 cells was increased \u03fe3-fold and the number of CD4 \u03e9 IL-2 \u03e9 increased \u03fe5-fold in the DC-NS5-bead immunization group. These results paralleled the proliferative response of splenocytes to NS5 protein obtained from immunized animals with the most significant response in the CD4\u03e9 population of DC-NS5-bead immunized animals. Finally, this group displayed a significant humoral immune response to NS5 as well. Conclusions: The use of NS5 coated beads combines three important aspects of dendritic cell based immunization in a single step: targeting of the antigen, enrichment and maturation of dendritic cells. The induction of a strong Th1 biased T cell response makes this approach a promising new tool in therapeutic immunization in chronically HCV infected patients.",

In contrast, the presence of multispecific CD4\u03e9 T cell response with \u03fe 10 ELISPOTs to at least 5 peptide pools (Pattern B, n \u03ed 4) was associated with viral clearance even when the CD8 response was mono-specific.

Conclusions: Whole HCV genome analysis reveals strikingly heterogeneous responses in the acute phase of infection, although in 45% of the cases, virologic outcome could be predicted. Understanding immune profiles associated with chronicity might lead to identification of patients who would benefit from early antiviral therapy. The absence of CD4\u03e9 T cells (even in the presence of vigorous CD8\u03e9 T cell responses) is not infrequently associated with viral persistence.

All samples were tested against the homologous genotype; those from the 3 mother-pairs also against heterologous genotypes. Percent neutralization was calculated by comparison with HCV-negative human sera. Children were grouped according to their ALT pattern during the first year of life: the first group (n\u03ed6) had persistently normal ALT or very mild changes (\u03fd80 IU); the second (n\u03ed6) developed an ALT peak (median 208, range 150-1230). In most cases, the ALT changes coincided with seroconversion (median 9 mos.), which was followed by a different viral evolution in the 2 groups, with an early increase in genetic diversity in the first group. In all children but 1, ALT levels returned to normal or slightly elevated during the second year. NAbs cross-reactive against heterologous genotypes were detected in all 3 mothers tested and in their offspring. Three of the 6 children studied within the first 4 mos. of life showed NAbs that later disappeared, suggesting their maternal origin. During follow-up, NAbs appeared in 8/12 children, after a median of 11 mos. from seroconversion. However, only transient and low-level NAbs were detected in children with mild or no ALT elevations, although the presence of strain-specific NAbs could not be ruled out. NAbs were generally more sustained in those who had previously developed acute hepatitis. The only exceptions were 2 children with acute hepatitis and a complete absence of NAbs, whose virus did not change over time; 1 had the most severe and prolonged hepatitis (ALT peak 1230).

In core expressing cells, there was a more rapid initial rise in mitochondrial Ca but this fell to below baseline within 30 s. The rapid decrease corresponded to MPT as evidenced by sudden loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings were confirmed by measurement of cytosolic Ca changes in the presence and absence of the mitochondrial Ca uptake inhibitor, Ru-360. Mitochondrial buffering of cytosolic Ca changes after exposure to thapsigargin was constant in control cells for greater than 5 min, but in core expressing cells mitochondrial buffering of cytosolic Ca changes was transient, began to decline after 30s and was undetectable by 90s. Core protein addition to isolated mitochondria produced an increase in initial Ca uptake. However, similar to the situation in cells, mitochondria isolated from HCV transgenic mice were more sensitive to Ca-or peroxide-induced MPT in vitro. Conclusions: HCV core protein produces ER stress and an initial increase in Ca transfer from ER to mitochondria. However, in response to prolonged stress, core increases mitochondrial sensitivity to oxidantand Ca-dependent MPT. These data suggest that the mitochondrial abnormalities associated with HCV core protein are mediated by changes of ER-mitochondrial Ca communication. Supported by NIH grant AA12863. ",

Gene silencing by siRNA implicated wnt-1, a secreted protein as the major mediator of growth promotion. To determine the role of WISP2 in this process, we cloned its promoter and coding sequence, and performed a functional analysis. Methods: WISP2 promoter was amplified by PCR and cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The promoter activity was monitored by luciferase assay after transfection into Tet-on inducible core expressing cells or cotransfection with core gene into Huh-7 cells. The WISP2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into an expression vector under control of a CMV promoter, and its role in cell proliferation was examined by transient transfection and a modified MTT assay. Results: Core gene expression or the presence of HCV full-length replicon significantly increased WISP2 promoter activity. The promoter activity was also induced by the culture medium from core expressing cells, suggesting secreted factor(s) may be a responsible mechanism. Sequence analysis of the WISP2 promoter revealed a TCF-1 binding motif AACAAAG, confirming it as a downstream target of wnt-1 signaling pathway. Indeed, WISP2 promoter activity was upregulated by cotransfection with the wnt-1 gene, as well as by the corresponding culture medium. Transfection of WISP2 gene significantly increased cell proliferation in a variety of liver derived cells, including Huh-7, Hep-3B, HepG2 and FOCUS. Moreover, the culture medium collected from cells transfected with WISP2 gene promoted cell growth as well, indicating WISP2 as a secreted growth factor. Conclusion: WISP2 transcription is upregulated by HCV core protein and wnt-1, confirming it as a downstream target of wnt-1 signaling. As a member of connective tissue growth factors, WISP2 protein can promote liver cell growth. Further understanding the regulation of wnt-1/WISP2 signaling by HCV core protein may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of HCV related HCC and begins to define the critical role of viral-cellular protein interactions in this process.",

Routinely processed sections were scored for grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis. \u2423-SMA expression in activated HSCs was evaluated using a monoclonal antibody to \u2423-SMA, streptavidin-avidin-biotin labeled and signal visualized with diaminobenzidine. The presence of \u2423-SMA immunoreactive HSCs was semiquantitatively scored (ASMA score) in portal tracts/fibrous septa and hepatic lobules (perisinusoidal) as described by Schmitt-Graf. Statistical analysis was done using the t test and logistic regression. Results: Serum ALT levels and HCV viral loads were similar in each group, and most patients had genotype 1. Seventy-seven percent of coinfected patients had CD 4 counts \u03fe200. Gender distribution was similar between the two groups with the majority of each group composed of males. Coinfected patients were younger (47\u03ee1.6 years) than HCV patients (52.2\u03ee1.7 years, p\u03fd0.05). The total ASMA score was similar between the two groups (3.33\u03ee0.34 vs 2.47\u03ee0.40, p\u03ed0.13) and the portal/septal ASMA score was similar between the two groups (1. 67\u03ee0.18 vs 1.53\u03ee0.22, p\u03ed0.65) . However, the perisinusoidal ASMA score was significantly higher in HIV/HCV coinfected patients (1.73\u03ee0.18) compared to HIV monoinfected patients (0.93\u03ee0.24, p\u03ed0.02). Coinfection with HIV was associated with a higher perisinusoidal ASMA score with an OR of 2.1. In both groups, a higher ASMA score was associated with a lower prevalence of inflammation (lower grade) with an OR of 0.46, and an OR of 0.24 when adjusted for HIV coinfection. Discussion: HIV/HCV coinfected patients progress more rapidly to cirrhosis than HCV monoinfected patients suggesting that HIVinduced immunosuppression contributes to disease progression. These coinfected patients were found to have less hepatic inflammation but increased perisinusoidal HSC activation (lower grade with higher ASMA score). Thus, immunosuppression or immune mechanisms within the liver may be associated with increased HSC activation and more rapid fibrogenesis.",

Aim: To determine CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Treg frequency, function, and relationship in HCV related HCC. Methods: PBMC from chronic HCV patients with HCC (n\u03ed20), chronic HCV patients (n\u03ed30), and normal controls (n\u03ed15) were analyzed for CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 T cells frequency and FoxP3 expression. Peripheral CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 T cells from HCV related HCC were cocultured with CD4 \u03e9 CD25in the presence of PHA to functionally define their suppressive properties using the 3 H thymidine proliferation. Transwell 3 H proliferation studies using CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 CD25target cells were also performed. Supernatants were analyzed for IL-10 by ELISA. The relative FoxP3 mRNA level was determined via quantitative PCR in the PBMC and via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in liver tissue/HCC. Viral, ALT, AFP and imaging data with tumor burden were collected for correlation analysis. To study the mechanism of HCC regulation of Tregs, a murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1 was co-cultured with murine CD4 cells and Treg frequency was evaluated. Results: A significantly higher percentage of CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 Treg was found in the peripheral blood of HCV-HCC patients (n\u03ed20, mean 8.85%, p \u03fd0.01) as compared to healthy controls (n\u03ed15, 2.27%), and chronic infected patients (n\u03ed30, 3.02%).

Serum iron stores are frequently increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C, who also display enhanced liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HCV infection deregulates iron metabolism are unknown. Novel iron-regulatory proteins, including transferrin receptor2 and hepcidin have recently been identified. Unlike transferrin receptor1, transferrin receptor2 (trfR2) is expressed primarily in the liver, and its expression is regulated at the protein level by iron-laden transferrin. Hepcidin, a circulatory peptide synthesized by the liver, plays a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. HCV core protein has several distinct functions and has been shown to play a role in HCV pathogenesis. Thus, we studied the role of hepatitis C core protein in the regulation of trfR2 and hepcidin expression. The study employed an inducible human hepatoma cell line Huh-7/191-20, expressing HCV core protein under the control of the tet-off promoter, which exhibits tight conditional expression on the withdrawal of tetracycline. Withdrawal of tetracycline for 2 days induced significant expression of HCV protein, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis using an anti-HCV core protein monoclonal antibody. Huh-7/191-20 cells cultured in the presence of tetracycline, and hence lacking HCV core protein expression, were used as controls. TrfR2 expression was determined by western blot using a specific polyclonal antibody, and hepcidin expres-sion was determined by real-time quantitative PCR using Taqman fluorescent probes. The expression of trfR2 protein was significantly down-regulated in cells expressing HCV core protein compared to control cells. Ferritin protein expression also was downregulated upon HCV core protein expression. Interestingly, compared to control cells, hepcidin expression was significantly up-regulated in Huh-7/191-20 cells expressing HCV core protein.",

Here, we report the identification of an HLA-B27 restricted HCV specific CD8\u03e9 T cell epitope in the NS5 protein of the virus that is recognized in the majority of HLA-B27 positive females with resolved HCV infection. In chronically HCV infected patients, analysis of the corresponding viral sequence showed a strong association between sequence variations within this epitope region and expression of HLA-B27, indicating allele-specific selection pressure. Functional analysis performed in three chronically HCV infected patients revealed that the corresponding variant viral epitopes present viral escape mutations. Taken together, our results provide a first insight into the immunological basis for the protective role of HLA-B27 in HCV infection and suggest that the emergence of viral escape mutations within a protective epitope is a hallmark of viral persistence.

In particular whether HCV infection itself, not HCVassociated inflammation, contributes to hepatic iron accumulation is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of hepatic iron overload in transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein. Methods: Male C57BL/6 transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein (FL-N35 lineage, Gastroenterology 2002;122:352) and their normal C57BL/6 littermates were fed normal rodent diet and sacrificed at age of 4 and 8 months. These mice were examined for hepatic iron concentrations, localization of iron in the liver, serum iron concentrations and serum transferrin saturation, and the levels of mRNA of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), hepcidin and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) in the liver. The mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR assay. Results: There were no differences in the diet consumption and body weight gain between FL-N35 transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice. Liver histology did not show inflammation in both mice, even though a degree of steatosis was slightly greater in FL-N35 transgenic mice. Serum iron concentrations and serum transferrin saturation were higher in FL-N35 transgenic mice at age of 8 months (P\u03fd0.05). Hepatic iron concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectrometry were similar at age of 4 months between both mice, but were significantly higher at age of 8 months in FL-N35 transgenic mice (126.0 \u03ee 27 g/g liver weight) than in nontransgenic mice (94 \u03ee 32 g/g liver weight) (P\u03fd0.05). Hepatic iron was predominantly accumulated in the hepatocytes. The mRNA levels of TfR1 were higher at age of 5 months (P\u03fd0.05) and lower at age of 8 months (P\u03fd0.05) in FL-N35 transgenic mice, suggesting the downregulation of TfR1 expression by increased intracellular iron accumulation. The mRNA levels of DMT1 were significantly higher at age of 4 and 8 months. The mRNA levels of hepcidin were similar at age of 4 months between both mice, but were significantly lower at age of 8 months in FL-N35 transgenic mice.",

Comparison of IFN-g ELISpots for NS3-5 proteins revealed significantly reduced responses in HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative individuals (1/10 vs. 5/6, p\u03ed0.008). No difference was seen for the core peptides (3/10 vs. 4/6, p\u03edns). There was no significant CD4 proliferation to either core peptides, non-structural proteins or p24 antigen on the CFSE assays in the co-infected samples (n\u03ed11).

Conclusions: Failure of early immunological control of HCV in HIV-positive individuals is supported by the finding of weak antigen-specific T-cell responses to HCV antigens. Responses to NS3-5 are particularly associated with resolving HCV infection, and these were specifically lost in the co-infected group. The low IL-2 levels are consistent with the lack of significant CD4 proliferation, implying a deficient T-helper response. In addition, the loss of the normal relationship between inflammatory cytokine release and ALT suggests that non-specific responses are mounted which may fail to efficiently control HCV in the acute phase of infection.",

In this study we examined the ability of mononuclear cells from patients infected with genotype 1 to respond to stimulation with interferon \u2423 in vitro. We studied 22 patients from the Irish anti-D cohort contaminated in 1977 (chronic HCV-infection: n\u03ed13, spontaneous clearance n\u03ed9) and 11 healthy controls. PBMCs were collected and cultured in 100 UI/ml of IFN\u2423 for 6 hours. Real time PCR was used before and after stimulation to measure levels of mRNA specific for OAS2, MXA and PKR, three key genes of the JAK/Stat pathway of IFN\u2423 activation. Results: OAS2, MXA and PKR gene expression was clearly coregulated at baseline and after IFN\u2423 stimulation (0.68 \u03fd r \u03fd 0.82, p\u03fd0.01).

For this, another HCV replicon in which a neomycin phosphotransferase was replaced with a luciferase gene was used.

Inefficient inhibition of this pathway is likely to prime cells, through viral stimulation of IRF-3, to respond to treatment with exogenous interferon. Thus variable IRF-3 inhibition could influence the outcome of treatment with interferon. The purpose of this study is to evaluate NS3/4A mediated inhibition of IRF-3 in genotypes other than genotype 1, to assess the comparative degree of inhibition of this pathway between genotypes, and to correlate variation in degree of inhibition with variation in amino acid sequence and treatment response in chronic HCV. To assess the degree of NS3/4A inhibition of IRF-3 between HCV genotypes we utilized serum recovered from treatment responders and non-responders from each of the genotypes within the patient population at our institution (HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2b, 3a, 4, and 6).

Iodixanol gradients preserve the host lipoprotein/virus complexes and HCV RNA content of gradient fractions was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

Hepatocyte specific gp130-/-(alfpCre\u03e9 gp130 LoxP/LoxP ) mice significantly longer survived after infection with GAS compared to wildtype control animals (gp130 LoxP/LoxP ). Higher survival rates correlates with lower proliferation of group-A-streptococci in hepatocyte specific gp130-/-animals. Bacterial load in blood, spleen, kidney, lung and liver was significantly lower in alfpCre\u03e9 gp130 LoxP/LoxP compared to wildtype controls. Additionally induction of liver damage during GAS sepsis was dependent on gp130 in hepatocytes. Wildtype animals showed elevated serum AST levels and increased numbers of apoptotic bodies in the liver. In contrast hepatocyte specific gp130-/-animals had normal serum transaminases and significantly lower (25 fold) hepatic apoptosis. Infiltration of polymorph nuclear cell (PMN) was also reduced (4 fold) in gp130-/-mice compared to wildtype animals. To analyze cytokine secretion we determined IFN\u2425 and IL-6 levels during GAS induced septic shock. Hepatocyte specific gp130-/-mice had lower serum levels of IFN\u2425 and strongly reduced IL-6 levels. In order to identify IL6 dependent mediators of hepatic PMN infiltration we analyzed serum concentration of the chemokine KC, which is known to be a chemotactic stimulus for PMN's. Indeed serum and liver KC protein levels strikingly increased in wildtype but not in hepatocyte specific gp130-/-mice. These data correlate with reduced PMN infiltration during GAS induced septic shock in hepatocyte specific gp130-/-mice. In summary hepatocyte specific gp130-/-mice are less sensitive to GAS induced septic shock concerning survival, bacterial load in liver and other organs. They developed reduced liver damage and hepatic PMN infiltration. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced. The PMN migration mediating chemokine KC is induced in an IL6/gp130 dependend manner in sepsis and seems to be an potential mediator of GAS induced septic liver damage.",

Notably, Rosi pretreatment markedly attenuated the LPS-mediated suppression of nuclear RXR\u2423 levels, resulting in increased nuclear binding activity of RXR\u2423-containing heterodimers, indistinguishable from control levels. Interestingly, Rosi did not affect production of several LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver. However, in IL-1\u2424-treated HepG2 cells, Rosi pre-treatment blocked the reduction of nuclear RXR\u2423 levels and maintained RXR\u2423 whole cell levels. This suggests that Rosi inhibits IL-1\u2424mediated RXR\u2423 nuclear export and subsequent degradation. Conclusions: Both in vivo and in vitro, Rosi pre-treatment attenuates inflammation-mediated suppression of RXR\u2423-regulated hepatic genes. Given the central role of RXR\u2423 in a broad variety of essential hepatic functions, this suggests that Rosi may have a role in modulating the deleterious effects of inflammation in acute and chronic liver diseases. cellular immune-response against HCV NS5. Methods: Balb/c mice were fed the Lieber-DiCarli diet for 6 weeks and DCs were generated in control and ethanol-fed mice using hydrodynamic delivery of Flt3L expressing plasmid. DCs were purified using CD11c magnetic beads and analyzed for endocytosis capacity, cell surface marker expression, and cytokine production. In a second experiment, syngeneic DCs were used for adoptive transfer at the time of immunization with an NS5 expression plasmid. Immune responses were assessed using a Cr 51 release assay and the generation of anti-NS5 antibodies by ELISA. Results: There was a quantitative defect in the proliferation of DCs in the ethanol fed animals. In the resting state, DCs isolated from the ethanol fed group expressed less CD40 and CD86; however there was no difference in the maturation marker expression after stimulation with endotoxin and poly IC. Endotoxin-induced maturation was associated with increased production of IL1\u2424 and IL10 and less IL6, INF\u2425, IL12, and TNF\u2423 by DCs isolated from the ethanol fed group. There was no difference in the endocytosis capacity of DCs isolated from ethanol and isocaloric pair-fed control-groups. The defect in cell mediated response against NS5 in the ethanol fed group was completely corrected by syngeneic transfer of DCs isolated from control animals; the defect was not corrected by transfer of DCs isolated from the ethanol fed animals. In contrast, transfer of DCs isolated from ethanol fed mice to control mice at the time of DNA-based immunization was associated with a significant decrease of CD8\u03e9 immune mediated responses as measured by cytotoxicity assay. Conclusions: Generation of DCs in mice fed an ethanol-containing diet was impaired and associated with an abnormal cytokine profile. There was a striking decrease in the cellular immune response to HCV NS5 protein following genetic immunization. Finally, syngeneic transfer of DCs confirmed their major role as a cause of impaired cellular immune response during chronic ethanol consumption. These findings may have relevance to persistent HCV infection in alcoholics.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence suggests that liver regeneration is suppressed in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previously, we have demonstrated that the TLR3 ligand poly I:C, a synthetic double-stranded RNA which is generated during viral infection, suppresses liver regeneration in the partial hepatectomy (PHx) model via an NK/IFN-\u0192\u03eb-dependent mechanism. Here we examined the role of IFN-\u0192\u03eb-activated downstream signals and genes (STAT1, IRF-1, p21cip1, SOCS1) in poly I:C/IFN-\u0192\u03eb suppression of liver regeneration and hepatocyte proliferation. Disruption of the STAT1 gene enhanced liver regeneration and markedly abolished poly I:C suppression of liver regeneration, while the inhibitory effect of poly I:C on liver regeneration was only weakly diminished in IRF-1-/-and p21cip1 -/-mice. In vitro treatment with IFN-gamma inhibited cell proliferation of wild-type mouse hepatocytes but not STAT1-/-mouse hepatocytes. The inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on hepatocyte proliferation was also partially diminished in IRF-1-/-and p21cip1-/-mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, IFN-gamma treatment induces more profound suppression of hepatocyte proliferation in SOCS1-/-hepatocytes, which correlates with enhanced STAT1 activation by IFN-gamma in these cells. Finally, STAT1 was activated and induced in the livers of patients with chronic HCV infection, which was inversely correlated with hepatocyte proliferation (PCNA staining) in these patients. In conclusion, STAT1 is involved in TLR3 ligand suppression of liver regeneration, and may also be implicated in suppressed hepatocyte proliferation in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection in light of hyperactivation of STAT1 in these patients. We analyzed the role of EBI3 for T cell mediated liver injury by challenging EBI3 knockout (EBI3-/-) mice with ConA. Methods: Con A was injected in EBI3-/-mice and wildtype control C57Bl/6 mice (25mg/kg i.v.). 8 hours after Con A administration mice were killed and blood was taken for analysis of AST and ALT and livers were fixed in formalin or frozen at -80\u00b0C, respectively.

Histopathological examination of liver sections from EBI3-/-mice showed only mild degenerative changes, while there were severe and diffuse pathological findings in wildtype mice. Expression of IFN-gamma-and TNF-alpha-mRNA was significantly lower in liver lysates from ConA-treated knockout mice in comparison with control animals, whereas expression of IL-10 was increased the liver of EBI-/-mice. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate a key pathogenic role for IL-27 in the ConA-model of T cell mediated liver injury. Using EBI3-/mice our results suggest a harmful role for IL-27, because deficiency of EBI3 protects mice from ConA-mediated hepatitis. However, some liver injury was still detectable suggesting a pathogenic role for EBI3 independent proinflammatory signaling pathways in this model. In one of our early studies we showed that replacing long-chain triglycerides (LCT) (up to 42% of total dietary calories) with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) reduces alcohol-induced liver injury. This beneficial effect of MCT was subsequently confirmed by a number of other investigators and resulted in the therapeutic use of MCT. In view of the similarity of the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver damage and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we wondered whether MCT might also be beneficial in the latter condition. Accordingly, we used an experimental model of NASH, which we recently developed in the rat, and corn oil (35% of total calories) was isocalorically replaced with MCT (12 rats in each group). To our surprise, the MCT animals developed much more striking inflammation than those given equivalent amounts of corn oil. The morphologic change was associated with a very significant increase in the hepatic inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u00e1 (220. As expected, nuclear binding activity to at least one key NR binding site, (DR2) was markedly reduced in hepatic nuclear extracts from chow-fed, LPS-treated mice, but increased in curcumin-fed LPS-treated mice. Conclusions: Dietary curcumin, a safe component of the spice turmeric with potential anti-inflammatory properties, nearly completely inhibited downregulation of RNA levels mediated by LPS for most of the 11 analyzed genes in particular for genes involved in bile salt transport and bile flow, suggesting that curcumin may be a potential therapeutic compound in inflammatory cholestatic liver disease.",

Liver cells were treated with different bile acids and effects on IL-6 signalling were tested on protein level by western blot and on RNA level by real time PCR. Results: Preincubation of rat hepatocytes or NTCP-HepG2 cells with glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) or Taurolithocholic acid-3 sulfate (TLCS) inhibited phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on Tyrosin 705 by IL-6 (10 ng/ml) in a time and concentration dependent way. The protein expression of STAT3 was stable during the early time points while decreasing after longer preincubation times. Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of Jak/STAT-pathway, was not induced by GCDC as measured on mRNA level by quantitative real time PCR. Furthermore, GCDC reduced expression of gp130, the signal transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor, in NTCP-HepG2 and rat hepatocytes without influence on mRNA of gp130. The expression of gp80, the \u2423 subunit of the IL-6 receptor, was unchanged under bile acid stimulation. Inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 (25 mol/l) or the lysosome by bafilomycin A (250 nmol/l) was not able to restore expression of gp130. In presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-FMK; 100 mol/l) or the antiapoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) expression of gp130 was nearly restored completely, but nevertheless the inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3-phosphorylation on tyrosine 705 was unchanged. Other caspases activating stimuli like CD95 ligand or hyperosmotic conditions also reduced gp130 expression. In hepatocytes, the inhibition of IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 by GCDC could partially be restored by inhibiting p38 MAPK with a pharmacologic inhibitor (SB220025 20 mol/l). Discussion: Interleukin-6 is essential for liver regeneration and hepatic acute phase reaction in response to inflammatory stimuli and it is upregulated during cholestatic syndromes. Bile acids accumulate during cholestasis and may trigger hepatotoxicity, while they modulate the hepatic interleukin-6-signalling and probably acute phase reaction.",

            "text": "The Treatment of KCs from EtOH-and PF rats with LPS rapidly increased ROS production, measured by dihydroRhodamine fluorescence. ROS production increased 2-fold after EtOH feeding compared to PF. Pre-treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), to inhibit NADPH oxidase, normalized ROS production in KCs from EtOH-fed rats to control levels. LPS stimulation resulted in a rapid and transient translocation of p47 phox to the plasma membrane in KCs from PF rats. In contrast, after EtOH-feeding, p47 phox at the plasma membrane was already increased over PF at baseline, and did not increase further in response to LPS. We next asked if increased NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS contributed to the dysregulation of MAPK activation after EtOH feeding. While LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation were increased 2-4-fold in KCs from EtOH-fed rats compared to PF controls, DPI only normalized LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with no effect of p38 activation. Treatment of KCs with 4-methylpyrazole or chlormethiozole to inhibit CYP2E1 or allopurinol to inhibit xanthine oxidase reduced LPS-stimulated ROS production, but had no effect on LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Increased ERK1/2 activation contributes to enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF\u2423 secretion by KCs after chronic EtOH feeding. Pre-treatment with DPI at concentrations that normalized ERK1/2 activation also effectively reduced LPS-stimulated TNF\u2423 production in KCs from both pair-and EtOH-fed rats. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that chronic EtOH feeding increases LPS-stimulated NADPH oxidase-dependent production of ROS in KCs. Further, we have identified ERK1/2 phosphorylation as an important and specific target of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in KCs contributing to enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF\u2423 secretion by KCs after chronic EtOH feeding.(Supported by NIH AA11975 and AA013868). HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 42, No. 4, Suppl. 1, 2005 AASLD ABSTRACTS Results: Adiponectin mRNA was readily detectable in healthy liver tissue. Induction of ConA-mediated acute liver failure resulted in increased adiponectin expression. Adiponectin was mainly expressed in endothelial cells. A weak staining was observed in hepatocytes. In vitro adiponectin mRNA expression was detectable in several cell types, including endothelial and stellate cell lines, hepatocytes, and macrophages. Mice pretreated with adiponectin before ConA administration revealed less hepatotoxicity as shown by reduced release of transaminases and Tunel staining. Of note, plasma and hepatic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-12 or IFN-gamma were not affected by adiponectin, whereas IL-10 production was increased. Neutralisation of IL-10 using an IL-10 blocking antibody significantly diminished the protective effect of adiponectin. Summary and Conclusion: Adiponectin expression is upregulated in ConA-mediated acute liver failure. Therefore, adiponectin might play an important role in the control and limitation of inflammation in the liver. Moreover, our data suggest an important role for IL-10 in adiponectin-regulated hepatoprotection.",

            "text": "Chronic ethanol consumption can lead to a variety of pathological consequences by as yet undefined mechanisms. Recently it has been noted that alcohol-associated liver disease is often accompanied by morphological liver changes that include the increased production of apoptotic cells. In addition, recent data from our laboratory demonstrated that hepatocellular uptake of apoptotic cells was impaired after ethanol treatment. We hypothesize that this ethanol-induced accumulation of apoptotic cells may lead to the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to hepatocyte damage, such as interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). The goal of the present study was to determine whether ethanol administration altered responsiveness of Kupffer cells to the presence of apoptotic cells in culture. Methods: Kupffer cells were isolated from female Wistar rats after 8 weeks of feeding with a fish-oil diet containing ethanol or an equivalent amount of dextrose as a control. Isolated Kupffer cells were cultured for up to 24 hours in the absence or presence of apoptotic hepatoma cells, non-apoptotic hepatoma cells, and lipopolysaccharide (as a control measure of Kupffer cell activity). After incubation, media was collected, clarified by centrifugation and assayed for the presence of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by immunoassay detection. Total RNA was also obtained from the same Kupffer cell cultures using Trizol Reagent followed by the determination of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Kupffer cells from both ethanol and control-fed animals were responsive in our culture conditions, as shown by increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in the presence of LPS. When Kupffer cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of apoptotic cells, significantly more TNFalpha and IL-6 (80 and 60% respectively, p\u03fd0.05) were produced in cells from ethanol-fed animals compared to controls; nonapoptotic cells did not affect cytokine production in either cell type. Additionally, after as early as 4 hours in culture and in the presence of apoptotic cells, mRNA levels of both cytokines were increased (2-5 fold) in cultures from ethanol-fed animals compared to controls. Conclusions: Chronic ethanol administration to rats results in the in vitro activation of Kupffer cells in response to apoptotic cells with a subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further characterization of these results will help elucidate the effect of ethanol on apoptotic cell production, on responses of liver cells to apoptotic cells, and on the pathological injury that occurs following these events.",

Methods: Patients were eligible with HBeAg positive CHB, serum HBV DNA \u0546 10 6 copies/mL, and 2 ALT measurements within normal limits in the 2 years prior to liver biopsy. The mean value of the 2 ALT measurements was calculated. Liver biopsies were scored using the Batts and Ludwig scoring method with a 4-point scoring scale for inflammation and fibrosis. Results: 9 men and 4 women were enrolled. Median age was 26 (range 19-46). All had endemically-acquired infection by history. Nine patients were born in China, 2 in Vietnam, 1 in Korea, and 1 in Cambodia. Median ALT was 28 U/L (range 13-77) and median serum HBV DNA was 5.1 x 10 7 (range 4.5 x 10 4 -3.4 x10 8 ). On biopsy, 10 of 13 (77%) had evidence of fibrosis: None had cirrhosis or septal fibrosis; 6 of 13 (46%) had periportal fibrosis or rare portal-portal septa, resulting in fibrosis scores of 2, and 4 of 13 (31%) patients had portal fibrosis with at most mild periportal fibrosis, yielding fibrosis scores of 1 or 1-2. Mean liver biopsy grade was 1.23 (range 1-2) and mean stage was 1.30 (range 0-2).

Therefore, there is no evidence of ETVr emerging in nucleoside na\u00efve patients treated with ETV. Virologic rebounds due to resistance were observed in 10% of LVD refractory patients treated with ETV for 2 years.

Of the 12 patients exhibiting a rebound, 2 had been on suboptimal ETV therapy (0.5 mg) and 3 others received ETV/LVD combination therapy. Subsequent analysis of baseline viral samples demonstrated selection of ETVr substitutions during prior LVD treatment. Summary: There was no evidence of emerging ETVr in nucleoside treatment na\u00efve subjects undergoing 2 years of ETV therapy, coinciding with substantial suppression of viral DNA levels. Among LVD refractory patients, 10% experienced virologic rebounds due to emerging ETVr by the 2nd yr of therapy. Phenotypic ETVr required the presence of pre-existing LVDr substitutions, which can be selected with exposure to LVD. Therefore, LVD treatment results in frequent emergence of LVDr and may negatively impact future HBV treatment options.",

We evaluated the Sustained Response (SR) rate to IFN and factors influencing both treatment and disease outcome in a large series of patients (pts). We followed up prospectively 558 anti-HBe positive CHB pts (451 males and 107 females; mean age 41 y, range 12-66 y) from 13 Italian Centers. Patients were treated for at least 3 months ( antiviral therapy: one received successively lamivudine, add-on adefovir \u03e9 lamivudine, followed by a lamivudine \u03e9 adefovir \u03e9 Hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIg) after liver transplantation, and the 2nd received IFN, lamivudine then entecavir. For genotypic analysis, a 1142 bp region of the polymerase gene encompassing the rt domain and overlapping the S gene was amplified by PCR for each sample, cloned and sequenced. For phenotypic analysis, an HBV replication-competent plasmid was constructed from HBV DNA isolated from patient serum (Durantel et al. Hepatology 2004) . The rt gene from the selected clones previously sequenced was then subcloned in this vector. Transfection of these HBV mutants in hepatoma cell line led us to determine their replication efficiency and drug susceptibility. At baseline, all HBV genomes carried a wild-type (wt) rt gene but, for the first patient, 36 % harbored the P120S mutation within the S gene associated with vaccine escape. Following viral breakthrough to LAM monotherapy, a complex mixture of LAM-resistant HBV strains emerged, with the prevalence of the rtL180M\u03e9M204V mutant for the first patient and of the rtV173L\u03e9L180M\u03e9M204V mutant for the second. In vitro, all the tested mutants showed a 1000 fold resistance to LAM relative to wt HBV. Following the switch to ADV for the first patient, or to ETV for the second, the viral load dropped but rose again after 3 and 2 years of therapy respectively. During this rebound, we observed a complex mixture of LAM \u03e9 ADV or ETV resistant strains. For the first patient, the selection of only one HBV mutant was finally observed. This mutant harbored the rtV173L\u03e9L180M\u03e9A181V\u03e9N236T mutations, a combination of resistance mutations to both drugs, and the sP120S mutation escaping to HBIg. Interestingly, the main LAM resistance mutation rtM204V disappeared from the viral population. The dominance of this complex rt mutant may be explained by our in vitro findings of a greater resistance to ADV\u03e9 LAM, and a level of replication equivalent to wt HBV. For the second patient, we observed a mixture of 3 mutants during rebound. All these mutants had the rtS202G mutation, not yet described, but also the rtL180M\u03e9M204V LAM resistance mutations despite the absence of LAM during ETV therapy. All these mutants were resistant to both LAM and ETV in vitro. Our results show the evolution of viral quasi-species towards the selection of mutants escaping to multiple selective pressures. This suggests that de novo combination therapy should be further evaluated to prevent drug resistance.",

During combination antiviral treatment most wild-type strains are eliminated and stable HBV core antigen variants become prevalent. The emergence of mutations within HBV core immunodominant epitopes may interfere with effective immune response and viral control. Aim: To evaluate the dynamic changes in serum HBV DNA levels during combined antiviral treatment in relation to the emergence of mutations within the HBV core gene and to study their contribution to treatment outcome. Patients: Twenty-three children (8 males, median age 10.2 years, range 2.9-16.8) with infancy-acquired hepatitis B (all HBeAg positive) were treated with lamivudine (3mg/kg/d) for 52 weeks and interferon a (5MU/m 2 TIW) from week 9 for 44 weeks. According to treatment outcome, patients were divided into 5 responders (R) and 18 non-responders (NR). Seven untreated HBeAg positive paediatric patients (3 males, median age 9.8 years, range 3.8-14.1) served as controls (C). Methods: HBV DNA levels were measured in serial serum samples by real-time TaqMan PCR before (treatment week 0 -TW0), during (TW2, TW9, TW28, TW52) and after (follow-up week-FUW24) antiviral treatment. The number of HBV DNA copies per ng of genomic liver DNA was evaluated at baseline by the same method. Mutations within the HBV core gene were determined at baseline within the liver and in sequential serum samples by restriction fragment length polymorphism after nested PCR, and by direct sequencing at the same time-points as HBV DNA levels.",

            "text": "Results: HBV DNA viral load in liver (log 10 copies/ng of liver genomic DNA) and in serum (log 10 copies/ml) is shown in the table (mean\u03eeSEM). The decrease in the number of HBV DNA copies/ml in serum was significantly higher among responders (p\u03ed0.003) from TW9. The number of mutations within the HBV core gene was significantly higher in non-responders (4.38\u03ee0.6) than responders (1.25\u03ee0.5, p\u03ed0.023) at TW28. There was a strong correlation between serum HBV DNA levels and number of mutations in HBV core gene was found (p\u03ed0.002) among treated patients. Conclusion: A decrease of HBV DNA levels \u03fe 3.5 log 10 copies/ml at TW9 predicts therapy outcome. The strong correlation between HBV DNA levels and the number of mutations within the HBV core gene suggests that variant strains contribute to virus control failure. Background and Aim: Lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy suppresses HBV replication in only 20-30% of HBeAg-negative cirrhotics treated for 5 years. Aim of the study was to assess in these patients the 5-yr efficacy of a sequential LAM to LAM\u03e9ADV therapy and its impact on disease progression and death. Patients and Methods: We prospectively followed up for 60 months (5-99) 124 HBeAg-negative cirrhotic patients (106 males, 54 years) who were given lamivudine alone or LAM\u03e9ADV in patients developing lamivudine resistance (LAM-R). Patients were followed with LFTs and serum HBV-DNA (Versant 3.0, Bayer, LLQ 3.3 log 10 copies/mL) every two months and with US scan every six months. Clinical LAM-R was when ALT peaked above the ULN and HBV-DNA \u03fe6 log and genotypic LAM-R when ALT remained within the normal range and HBV-DNA increased to below 6 log. Results: Of the 42 patients developing clinical LAM-R, 35 (83%) were rescued by adding ADV (Group A). By converse, 82 patients were either long-term responders to LAM monotherapy (n\u03ed54) or were added ADV to LAM at the time of genotypic LAM-R (n\u03ed28) (Group B). In the latter group, addition of ADV led HBV-DNA to became undetectable in all patients within 4 months and to remain so in the following years. Furthermore, ALT levels remained within the normal range throughout the study period. The 5-yr rates of undetectable HBV-DNA were 67% and 100% in Group A and B patients, respectively (p\u03fd0.001). None of the patients developed ADV-R, three patients of Group B seroconverted to anti-HBs and discontinued antiviral therapy. Clinical decompensation Methods: Study ETV-022 and ETV-027 enrolled treatment-na\u00efve, HBeAg(\u03e9) and HBeAg(-) patients, respectively. ETV-026 enrolled LVD-refractory, HBeAg(\u03e9) patients. Liver biopsies were performed before study entry and after 48 weeks of therapy. Baseline cirrhosis was defined in patients with evaluable biopsies as a Knodell fibrosis score of 4. Results: Approximately 8% of patients had cirrhosis at baseline; the distribution of cirrhotic patients was balanced between treatment groups. Cirrhotic patients on ETV were more likely than those on LVD to have histologic improvement, ALT normalization and undetectable HBV DNA, although the relatively small patient number limits interpretation. Efficacy results after 48 weeks of therapy for treatment-na\u00efve patients according to baseline cirrhosis status are presented below: In LVD-refractory patients, the response in the overall population for ETV over LVD was also seen in cirrhotic patients. Histologic improvement occurred in 50% and 55% of ETV-treated cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, and in 22% and 28% of LVD-treated cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, respectively. In all patients, the incidence of ALT flares with ETV (2%) and LVD (5%) was the same in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Serious adverse events were reported more frequently in cirrhotic (ETV 10%, LVD 14%) than non-cirrhotic patients (ETV 7%, LVD 8%). Baseline cirrhosis did not affect patient discontinuation. ALT \u03fe2x baseline \u03e9 total bilirubin \u03fe2x baseline and 2x ULN was reported in no cirrhotic and in \u03fd1% of non-cirrhotic patients. Conclusions: ETV treatment was effective and well-tolerated in compensated, cirrhotic patients with chronic HBV. In general, ETV response was comparable between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. * \u03fe\u03ed2 point decrease in baseline Knodell Inflammatory Score with no worsening of fibrosis. Patients had baseline Knodell Inflammatory Score \u03fe\u03ed2. treatment themselves, increasing from 54% for doctors seeing only a few patients a year to 90% for those seeing more patients. Physicians who do not prescribe treatment refer in only 62% to a specialized centre. Less than half (46%) of the physicians seeing patients work according a protocol. However 72% express a need for a standardised protocol, independently of the amount of patients seen, ranging from 50% for those seeing many patients increasing to 94% for those seeing a few patients a month, suggesting that availability of protocols could be a problem. Of those treating patients only 44% has ever used a nucleoside/ nucleotide analogue (NUC), which use increases from 18% for those seeing only a few patients a year to 78% seeing patients more frequently. In addition, among those treating patients but not using NUC, 72% do not refer to a specialised centre. The majority (61%) prescribing NUC do not perform mutation analysis during treatment, although 91% (p\u03fd0.001) has access to these tests. The use of a protocol does not imply that physicians treat patients themselves or use nucleoside analogues more often. However among the specialists using a protocol the access to the standard laboratory tests (HBV DNA) and specialised tests (resistance, genotype) is higher and resistance testing is performed more often suggesting that monitoring is improved but there still is reluctance to initiate treatment. In conclusion the more patients specialists see the more likely they will treat patients themselves. About one third of the physicians do not refer despite they do not treat patients and therefore deprive patients from treatment. Only 44% of the specialists ever used a NUC and most of them do not refer leaving e.g. interferon failures devoid of NUC treatment. In the development of HBV treatment guidelines more attention should be given to implementation of the guidelines especially with regard to initiation of treatment. Purpose: Evaluate HBV viral load (VL) after 24 weeks of treatment with either emtricitabine 200 mg (FTC) plus clevudine 10 mg (CLV) versus FTC monotherapy and to perform resistance surveillance for viremic patients. Methods: Nucleoside na\u00efve or experienced (48 weeks FTC 200 mg qd) patients were evaluated. Serum HBV DNA was assayed using a Real-Time PCR assay with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 250 copies/mL (cp/mL). Genotypic analysis of the polymerase was performed at week 24 (W24) for viremic (\u03fe4700 cp/mL) patients. Results: Seventy-eight HBeAg-patients were enrolled; 38 (n\u03ed24 experienced and n\u03ed14 na\u00efve) received FTC\u03e9CLV and 40 (n\u03ed28 experienced and n\u03ed12 na\u00efve) received FTC monotherapy. The median baseline HBV DNA VL was 4 log 10 cp/mL. At W24 a -1.6 log 10 and -1.4 log 10 reduction in serum HBV DNA was observed for experienced patients in the combination and monotherapy arms, respectively, and a -1.9 log 10 reduction was observed among na\u00efve patients, regardless of treatment arm. Among experienced patients, 86% given FTC\u03e9CLV versus 63% given FTC had HBV DNA \u03fd250 cp/mL at W24, and among na\u00efve patients, the proportions were 69% and 67%, respectively. The W24 prevalence of FTC associated mutations was 7% and 0% among experienced and na\u00efve patients, respectively. Conclusion: In this HBeAg-population, both emtricitabine plus clevudine and emtricitabine monotherapy produced a favorable antiviral response at week 24 as demonstrated by the median change from baseline in HBV DNA and by the proportion of patients with HBV DNA below the limit of detection. At week 24 no na\u00efve patient presented with FTC resistance mutations whereas the rate was 7% among FTC experienced patients.",

            "text": "Background/Aim: The treatment of chronic hepatitis B by antiviral agents has lead to the selection of polymerase (pol) reverse transcriptase (rt) mutations with concomitant mutations in the overlapping S gene encoding for HBsAg. For diagnostic and monitoring purposes it is important to detect both wild type and any mutant HBsAg that might result during antiviral treatment. Immunoassays use various combinations of monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal antibodies for HBsAg detection, the impact of the drug-selected mutants in FDA approved HBsAg diagnostic assays is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of antiviral selected mutations on the antigenicity, detection, and structure of HBsAg. Methods: A number of lamivudine (LMV) and entecavir (ETV) resistant pol/S gene mutations described previously were synthesized by site-directed mutagensis in an HBV genotype D infectious clone. These include various combinations of the pol mutations at rtI169T (sF161L), rtV173L (sE164D), rtL180M, rtM204V (sI195M) and rtM250V. The wild type clone and the vaccine escape mutant sG145R were included as controls. All clones were transfection into Huh7 cells. Epitope mapping of HBsAg was performed by solid phase enzyme immunoassay using four distinct anti-HBs monoclonal antibodies directed against the \"a\" determinant and western blot analysis was also performed. Results: For all pol mutant clones tested, the \"a\" determinant immunoreactivity of these downstream mutations was similar to the wild type virus, indicating no alteration in major epitope reactivity for the anti-HBs monoclonal antibodies studied. A LMV resistant HBV mutant rtV173L \u03e9 rtL180M \u03e9 rtM204V (sE164D \u03e9 sI195M) that was previously reported to be associated with reduced HBsAg antigenicity was able to be detected by all four \"a\" determinant mAb's. The level of HBsAg secretion was lower for the ETV resistant antiviral mutant rtI169T \u03e9 rtV173L \u03e9 rtL180M \u03e9 rtM204V \u03e9 rtM250V. The ETV mutant encodes the HBsAg mutations at sF161L\u03e9sE164D\u03e9sI195M. The effect of the ETV mutant on HBsAg intracellular retention is under investigation. In contrast to the pol mutants, the sG145R HBV mutant did show a reduction in mAb reactivity to the \"a\" determinant. Conclusions: Importantly, the \"a\" determinant immunoreactivity of the described pol mutants is preserved, suggesting that commercially available HBsAg immunoassays should readily detect these mutants. The ETV resistant mutant which encodes HBsAg mutations at sF161L\u03e9sE164D\u03e9sI195M was detected in low levels in the supernatant. The effect of antiviral selected HBsAg mutations on other HBV functions such as HBsAg/virion secretion and on pathogenicity is yet to be determined.",

The aim of this study was to document the efficacy and development of resistance to ADV in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection treated with ADV. Patients and Methods: 116 patients with chronic hepatitis B and lamivudine resistance were treated with ADV 10mg/day. Following introduction of ADV, lamivudine was continued in 81 patients and stopped in 35. HBeAg was positive in 74 cases and negative in 42. Five patients had had liver transplantation (OLT) prior to starting ADV, and 8 underwent OLT after starting ADV. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months (mean \u03ed 22 months). The presence of mutations of the HBV-polymerase gene conferring resistance to lamivudine and/or adefovir was examined using a new INNO-LiPA test (HBV DR v2, Innogenetics) . The HBV-DNA polymerase was also sequenced to analyze nucleotide changes. Serum HBV-DNA was measured by the Bayer b-DNA or the Roche PCR assay. Results: After one year of treatment with ADV, 61% of patients had HBV-DNA viral load below 100,000 copies/ml. This percentage increased to 77% after 2 years. Five patients developed phenotypic resistance to adefovir as evidenced by a 1 log increase in serum HBV-DNA during treatment (two OLT patients and 3 non-OLT). Resistance occurred after 1 year of treatment in 4 cases and after 3 years in the fifth case. The N236T mutation in domain D of the polymerase was detected in 4 of 5 cases. In one additional patient, the N236T mutation was detected after one year of treatment without evidence of phenotypic resistance. Among the cases with phenotypic resistance, 2 were receiving both adefovir and lamivudine (1 OLT, 1 non-OLT) and 3 were receiving adefovir only (1 OLT, 2 non-OLT). Conclusion: Patients with lamivudineresistant HBV infection exhibit a slow, but sustained response to adefovir in all but 2.9% of non-OLT patients after 1 year of treatment. The occurrence of resistance to ADV was more frequent in OLT patients (2 of 13 cases). esized that the efficacy of TA1 in treatment of HBV chronic infection could be ascribed to both the increase of the Th1 response and the decrease of the Th2 response, associated with persistence of viraemia.",

We therefore embarked on a rational drug design campaign to produce inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4 protease. Two lead compounds (ITMN A and ITMN B) emerged from our discovery paradigm with EC 50 potencies in biochemical and replicon assays of \u03fd2 nM (genotype 1b), liver levels in multiple species predictive of efficacious exposure in humans, and acceptable tolerability. Both of these com-pounds have been designated preclinical candidates and are currently undergoing IND-enabling toxicological assessment. The activity of both compounds on forms of the NS3/4 protease resistant to two other NS3/4 protease inhibitors, VX-950 and BILN-2016, was examined. Mutation of an alanine at position 156 to a serine (A156S) is a dominant resistance mutation to VX-950. ITMN A and ITMN B showed IC 50 s against the A156S NS3/4 protease of 4.5 nM and 2.4 nM, respectively; roughly 1,000-fold more potent than VX-950.

Murzenok, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Ottawa; Grayson Lipford, Tess K. Schmalbach, Art M. Krieg, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Wellesley, MA; Heather L. Davis, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Ottawa, CanadaIntroduction: CPG 10101 is one of a novel class of drugs, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, which target Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) found on human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). It is being developed as an antiviral and Th1 immune enhancer for treatment of chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). In two Phase I trials, CPG 10101 was shown to induce/upregulate certain cytokines and chemokines. Dose-dependent effects were demonstrated in both healthy volunteers and HCV infected subjects. Laboratory evaluations in those trials have been extended to immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to ascertain maturation and stimulatory effects of CPG 10101. Methods: In the Phase Ia trial, forty healthy volunteers were enrolled and assigned to 5 sequentially higher dose cohorts (0.25, 1, 4, 10 or 20 mg); randomized to drug (n\u03ed6) or placebo (n\u03ed2); given as 2 subcutaneous (SC) single doses, 14 days apart. A 6 th cohort received 4 mg twice weekly for 4 weeks. Subjects were evaluated to Day 29 for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunophenotyping. In a subsequent Phase Ib trial, HCV positive patients were randomized to CPG 10101 (n\u03ed6 or 7) or control (n\u03ed2) over the same range of doses administered twice weekly SC for 4 weeks, or at 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. Antiviral response (HCV RNA change from baseline) was correlated with the immune effects of CPG 10101. Results: In healthy volunteers, CPG 10101 caused up-regulation of several immunophenotypic markers during the first week after dosing. These included increased CD86 and CD38 on B lymphocytes and increased number of pDC with up-regulation of CD86, all predicted by the mechanism of CpG ODN. Subjects also showed a dose-dependent up-regulation of CD69 and CD25 activation markers on NK (CD3-, CD16\u03e9CD56\u03e9) and NK-T (CD3\u03e9,CD16\u03e9CD56\u03e9) cells. CD14\u03e9 cells (monocytes/neutrophils) showed a slight and transient decrease one day post-dosing followed by an increase by 2 days. Most of the cellular markers returned to baseline levels within two weeks after the first dose. Effects were similar after first and second administrations for a given subject. Analysis of immunophenotyping profiles in HCV subjects is underway.Summary: CPG 10101 activates and matures several types of immune cells in healthy individuals. These effects will be compared with those in HCV infected subjects, and both will be correlated with soluble pharmacodynamic markers of function of these cells, including serum levels of IFN-\u2423, IP-10, 2'5'A-synthetase and TNF-\u2423, which were detected by ELISA assay.Disclosures: John McHutchinson -Consultant for: Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Other Relationships: Investigator on Coley Pharmaceutical Group's trial., Discussion will include off-label / investigative use of medicine(s), medical devices or procedure(s) Bruce Bacon -Consultant for: Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Other Relationships: Investigator for Coley Pharmaceutical Group's trial.

We aimed to assess the number and function of the regulatory T cells CD3\u03e9/CD4\u03e9/CD25\u03e9 (Tregs) during the acute phase of HCV and HAV infections in relation to chronic disease evolution. Methods: Thirty four subjects, including 12 patients with acute hepatitis C (AHC; Group A 12 genotype 1), 12 patients with acute hepatitis A (AHA; Group B) and 10 healthy individuals (Group C) were studied. Diagnosis of acute hepatitis C was made according to Nomura et al; (Hepatology 2004; 39:1213-9). Tregs were enumerated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using monoclonal antibodies anti-CD3-APC, anti-CD4-PE, anti-CD25-FITC (Beckman Coulter). Immunomagnetically purified Tregs (\u03fe 95%) (Dynal Treg cell separation and expansion kit) were tested in five patients in each group for their ability to inhibit proliferation of CD4\u03e9/CD25-T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (1:2, 1:20 and 1:200 ratio). Results: A significant elevation of Treg percent (13% \u03ee3%), absolute number (124 \u03ee 38 cells) and inhibitory activity (ratio 1:2\u03ed100%; 1:20 \u03ed99%) was present in 10/12 patients with acute hepatitis C in comparison with both HAV acute hepatitis patients (6.3% \u03ee 1.5 %; 38 \u03ee 26; ratio 1:2\u03ed80%; 1:20 \u03ed70%) (U Mann-Whitney test z \u03ed 2.45; p \u03fd 0.001; z \u03ed 3.28; p \u03ed 0.001; z \u03ed 2.59; p \u03fd 0.01) and normal donors (6% \u03ee 1%; 46 \u03ee 13; ratio 1:2\u03ed79%; 1:20 \u03ed55%) (z \u03ed 2.60; p \u03fd 0.001; z \u03ed 3.50; p \u03fd 0.001; z \u03ed 2.72; p \u03fd 0.01)(Figure;sample from 3 patients), in whom Tregs number and function were similar. In the 10 HCV with elevated Tregs number and function during acute phase, Tregs number remained elevated 6 months later (11%\u03ee 2%; 112 \u03ee 32 cells ) together with positivity for HCV-RNA and transaminase levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal six months later. The two patients with lower regulatory T cells at diagnosis (8%; 96 cells) also had a lower level after six months (7%; 82 cells) and resolved the infection having negative HCV-RNA and normal transaminases, as did all the HAV patients. Conclusion: Increased Tregs number and function at the time of acute hepatitis in the HCV patients who developed chronic hepatitis suggests that these cells may predispose to chronic evolution. An early Treg assessment in acute HCV infection may predict patients destined to chronic evolution, making them candidates for antiviral treatment.Disclosures:The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Alessandro Perrella, Luigi Atripaldi, Luigi Racioppi, Pio Conti, Oreste Perrella",

            "text": "-alpha), either alone or in combination with the nucleoside analog, ribavirin. Only a fraction of patients treated with IFN-alpha respond favorably by viral clearance. The Alb-UPA/SCID mouse is capable of proliferating and sustaining transplanted human hepatocytes, subsequently supporting HCV infection within the human portion of its chimeric liver. The Alb-UPA/SCID mouse model for HCV (HCV) infection was used as a platform for microarray analysis in which biological variables such as donor hepatocytes and HCV infection were tightly controlled. Within the chimeric mouse model, HCV genotype 1A (HCV-1A) infections have an attenuated response to IFN therapy relative to genotype 3A viral infections. Our primary mandate was to catalog the human hepatic genes whose expression levels change in response to infection with HCV-1A and in the absence of an active immune system. Secondly, we wanted to utilize this unique microarray platform to explore the mechanism by which HCV-1A evades interferon therapy. Thus, mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes, infected with HCV-1A, and treated with IFN-alpha. Human hepatocytes were recovered from the chimeric mice livers by collegenase perfusion followed by FACS analysis with monoclonal anti-human HLA class I antigen conjugated to FITC. Isolation of total RNA, synthesis of cRNA, and fragmentation of cRNA were performed according to Affymetrix protocols and quality control metrics were obtained using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior to hybridization to Human Genome U133A Plus 2.0 GeneChip Arrays (Affymetrix). The significantly changed genes between treatment subgroups were selected by a permutation t test using Significance Analysis of Microarays software (SAM v 2.1). Infection of transplanted mice with HCV-1A and treatment of non-infected mice with IFN-alpha induced significant changes in the hepatic transcriptome (having false discovery rates of 0% and 2-fold change values or greater). Our results also provide evidence that pre-infection with HCV-1A alters the hepatic transcriptome induced by the IFN-alpha monotherapy used in this study.Backgrounds and Aims:HCV infection is linked to increased insulin resistance. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1/2 are central molecules for insulin signaling and down-regulation of IRS1/2 is a causative factor for increased insulin resistance in patients with HCV infection(Kawaguchi et al. Hepatology 2004). Since HCV has various biological effects, HCV itself is a candidate for the development of insulin resistance. However, the effect of clearance of HCV on glucose metabolism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of clearance of HCV on insulin resistance, beta cell function and hepatic IRS1/2 expressions. Methods: We analyzed 89 biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C patients. All patients were received interferon-alpha therapy for 6 month. At the end of follow-up (6 month after the conclusion of antiviral therapy), all patients were classified as nonresponders (n \u03ed 48), relapsers (n \u03ed 12), sustained responders (n \u03ed 29). Insulin resistance and beta cell function were assessed by homeostasis model evaluation (HOMA-IR and HOMA %B, respectively). In 14 sustained responders, liver biopsy was performed before and after conclusion of antiviral therapy. Hepatic IRS1/2 expressions were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunostaining. All parameters at the end of follow-up were compared to those before antiviral therapy in each group. Results: In nonresponder, BMI significantly decreased to 21.0 \u03ee 1.9 kg/m 2 from 22.7 \u03ee 2.3 kg/m 2 (p \u03fd 0.05) after antiviral therapy, however, there were no significant changes in HOMA-IR and HOMA %B values at the end of follow-up compared to those before antiviral therapy (HOMA-IR: 4.2 \u03ee 1.6 vs. 3.8 \u03ee 2.0, HOMA %B: 114.2 \u03ee 10.8 vs. 106.9 \u03ee 16.8). In relapsers, no significant differences were seen in BMI, HOMA-IR and HOMA %B values at the end of follow-up compared to those before antiviral therapy (BMI: 21.9 \u03ee 2.1 kg/m 2 vs. 22.6 \u03ee 3.3 kg/m 2 , HOMA-IR: 3.7 \u03ee 1.2 vs. 3.9 \u03ee 1.5, HOMA %B: 121.6 \u03ee 12.5 vs. 110.1 \u03ee 14.2). In sustained responders, there was no significant difference in BMI at the end of follow-up (22.7 \u03ee 2.5 kg/m 2 vs. 20.8 \u03ee 2.9 kg/m 2 ). On the other hand, at the end of follow-up, HOMA-IR value significantly decreased to 1.7 \u03ee 0.8 from 3.1 \u03ee 1.1 (p \u03fd 0.05). Similarly, HOMA %B value significantly decreased to 90.6 \u03ee 10.0 from 113.7 \u03ee 15.3 (p \u03fd 0.05). Immunoblotting showed 3-fold increase in IRS1/2 expressions by clearance of HCV.

The aim of this study was to determine whether iron overload contributes to the development of liver cancer in transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein. Methods: Male C57BL/6 transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein (FL-N35 lineage, Gastroenterology 2002;122:352) and their normal C57BL/6 littermates were allocated to be fed iron overloaded diet (Fe diet, carbonyl iron 225 mg/kg diet) or control diet (carbonyl iron 45 mg/kg diet) at age of 8 weeks (FL-N35 fed Fe diet, FL-N35 fed control diet, nontransgenic mice fed Fe diet, nontransgenic mice fed control diet). 10 to 12 mice of each group were assessed for liver histology and development of liver tumor at 6 and 12 months after commencement of feeding. Results: There were no differences in the diet consumption and body weight gain between groups. At 6 months after commencement of feeding, hepatic iron concentrations were significantly higher in FL-N35 fed Fe diet (179.0 \u03ee 38.8 g/g liver weight) and nontransgenic mice fed Fe diet (216.4 \u03ee 66.3 g/g) than in mice in other 2 groups. Hepatic iron concentrations in mice fed Fe diet were comparable to those of patients with chronic hepatitis C (223.3 g/g). Hepatic iron was predominantly accumulated in the hepatocytes. There was no inflammation in transgenic livers. Compared with mice in other 3 groups, FL-N35 fed Fe diet showed marked hepatic steatosis including microvesicular one in zone 3, significantly increased triglyceride levels in liver (P\u03fd0.01), ultrastructural alterations of the mitochondria (swelling, disorganized cristae, bulging) and decrease in \u2424-oxidation activity (P\u03fd0.05). At 12 months after commencement of feeding, intrahepatic lipid peroxides (4-HNE and 4-HHE) (P\u03fd0.01) levels and 8-OHdG (P\u03fd0.01) content were significantly higher in FL-N35 fed Fe diet than in mice in other 3 groups. The number of cells positively stained for proliferation cell nuclear antigen in liver was significantly higher in FL-N35 fed Fe diet and nontransgenic mice fed Fe diet than in mice in other 2 groups. Hepatic tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma were present at necropsy in 5 of 11 (45%) FL-N35 fed Fe diet, but not present in mice in other 3 groups. Conclusions: Iron overload enhances mitochondrial injury and increases the risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein.Disclosures:The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Takakazu Furutani, Keisuke Hino, Sohji Nishina, Isao Hidaka, Yuki Yamaguchi, Masaaki Korenaga, Toshikazu Gondo, Shu-Yuan Xiao, Stanley Lemon, Kiwamu Okita, Michiari Okuda",

Similarly, the transfection of a plamid expressing HCV NS3 through NS5B proteins significantly inhibited the dsRNA-IFN responses. Taken together, it is indicated that expression of HCV proteins inhibit dsRNA-mediated IFN responses that was partly mediated by RIG-I and that these effects are universally observed in hepatocyte and nonhepatocyte cell lines.

We generated monocyte-derived DC in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 with or without IFN-\u2423 (IFN-DC or GM/4-DC) and compared their phenotypes, cytokine production, and DC-primed CD4 T-cell response between the patients and normal donors. In some experiments, we used both IFN-\u2423 and ribavirin for DC generation and examined their functions as described above. Results: In normal donors, IFN-DC stimulated CD4 T cells to produce more IFN-\u2425 than GM/4-DC (p\u03fd0.05). IFN-\u2423 up-regulated CD86 expression on DC (p\u03fd0.01). IFN-DC produced lesser amount of IL-10 than GM/4-DCs (p\u03fd0.01). Furthermore, the reduced IL-10 production by IFN-DC was inversely correlated with the increased IFN-\u2425 production by DC-primed T cells. There was a significant correlation between the increment of CD86 expression and that of IFN-\u2425 production. By contrast, in CHC patients, IFN-DC failed to enhance IFN-\u2425 secretion from DC-primed T cells. Although similar tendencies were observed in CD86 and IL-10 in IFN-DC in the patients, the fold increase of CD86 and the reduction of IL-10 in them were much less than those in normal donors (p\u03fd0.05). In addition, no correlation was found among any of these parameters in CHC patients. Of particular interest, the Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide. Treatment options are still limited to combination therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN) and ribavirin. Although more than 50 % of the patients with HCV genotype 1 show only a limited response to this therapy, the factors determining viral resistance to interferon are largely unknown. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM-1) has been implicated in several important cellular functions such as cell-cell adhesion, proliferation and angiogenesis. In addition this type I transmembrane glycoprotein serve as a receptor for different microbiological agents. Preliminary data suggest that CEACAM-1 may be involved in the cellular response of human hepatocytes to alpha interferon. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine function of CEACAM-1 during the IFN response in HCV infected individuals in vivo and in hepatic cells. Methods and Results: 21 patients with HCV infection were subjected to mono therapy with pegylated IFN (1.5 g/kg/weekly). 12 h prior and after the first dose the RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was isolated and analyzed for induction of known and unknown IFN sensitive genes using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. With both methods, CEACAM-1 RNA was found to be significantly upregulated 12 h after of IFN stimulation in vivo. This increase was positively correlated with the extent of decline of the viral RNA within the first 36 h after initiation of IFN therapy. These results led to analysis of IFN-induced CEACAM-1 expression in liver cells with or without two different HCV replicons. In primary human hepatocytes and different strains of HCV-negative HuH-7 human hepatoma cells, both CEACAM-1 RNA and protein (determined by immunoblot) were significantly upregulated with a maximum increase 12-24 h after IFN stimulation in vitro. In HuH-7 cells containing a highly adapted subgenomic HCV replicon (con1, genotype 1b), the level of CEACAM-1 RNA expression was significantly lower than in the corresponding parental cell line. In contrast, HuH-7 cells harbouring a different replicon that contained the NS3/NS4 and NS5a regions of two interferon resistant HCV strains (AD4 and AD78), CEACAM-1 RNA showed both increased spontaneous expression levels and a sustained response to IFN in comparison with naive cells. Conclusions: Our results show a differential function for CEACAM-1 in the systemic and the intrahepatic response of HCV to IFN and suggest involvement of this molecule in the signaling process conferring resistance of HCV infected liver cells to IFN.Disclosures:The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Philip Hilgard, Guido Gerken, Ruth Broering, Martin Trippler, J\u00f6 rg Schlaak, Sergei Viazov, Marc aus dem Siepen",

Caroline Martin, Soren U. Nielsen, Margaret F. Bassendine, Geoffrey L. Toms, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom (Great Britain)Background: Hepatitis C virus RNA recovered from infected human serum and liver macerates is found in low density complexes termed lipo-viro-particles (LVP) containing both virus structural proteins and host apolipoprotein B-100. It has been suggested that HCV-LVP may enter hepatocytes in a virus envelope glycoprotein independent manner via its association with host lipoprotein. Candidate receptors include the scavenger receptor protein, SR-B1 and the LDL receptor (LDL-r). Here we have studied the capacity of HCV-LVP to bind to and enter human hepatocytes. Methods: HCV-LVPs, free of antibody, were recovered by iodixanol gradient centrifugation of liver macerates from the explant of a patient with high viral load as previously described (1). LVP were allowed to attach to HepG2 cells or primary human liver hepatocytes treated with insulin to enhance LDL-r expression and cell-bound viral RNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR.Results: Approximately 2% of the HCV RNA in LVP preparations bound to HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Prior heparinase treatment of HepG2 cells reduced binding by 30%.A post-attachment suramine wash to remove virus bound to cell surface glycosaminoglycans reduced binding by only 12%, suggesting internalisation of virus. Suramine resistant LVP binding occurred in a dose dependent manner reaching a maximum by 3h post infection at 37\u00b0C and by 24h post infection at 4\u00b0C. Binding to hydroxyl-cholesterol treated cells was 2.5-fold lower than that to insulin treated cells, correlating with a 2.2-fold reduction in the expression of LDL-r as assessed by DiI labelled low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL) binding. Prior exposure of cells to excess LDL blocked HCV-LVP and DiI-labelled LDL binding to similar extents, providing some evidence that the LDL-r participates in binding of HCV-LVP. Prior exposure to oxidised LDL also blocked uptake of HCV-LVP, supporting SR-B1 as another candidate receptor. However binding was unaffected by treatment with antibodies to apoB-100, which completely abrogated binding of DiI-LDL. Conclusions: We conclude that liver derived HCV-LVP binding to human hepatocytes can be increased with insulin treatment and decreased with hydroxycholesterol treatment, in parallel with the uptake of LDL. HCV-LVP binding can be blocked by heparinase, purified LDL and oxidised LDL supporting the concept that HCV-LVP may utilise VLDL/LDL pathways for binding and entry into hepatocytes.1.

Ribeiro, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM; Alan S. Perelson, Los Alamos national Laboratory, Los Alamos, NMBackground: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health concern worldwide. State-of-the-art therapy (peg-interferon and ribavirin) elicits long-term responses in only about 50% of patients treated, with no effective alternative treatment for non-responder. Recently, cell-based HCV replicon systems were developed and they have become the benchmark for testing new antiviral agents against HCV.Methods:We developed a mathematical model of subgenomic HCV replication assuming that its strategy of replication involves single-stranded RNA templates. The model describes the amplification of subgenomic HCV in Huh-7 cells from transfection to steady state. Following the establishment of a steady state, we simulated the effects of antiviral agents with different modes of action and efficacies on replicon copy number, and compared the results with published data. We tested the sensitivity of our model by simulating one thousand random combinations of parameter values. Results: After initiation of IFN-\u2423 treatment of Huh-7 cells harboring replicons, an immediate biphasic decline of HCV plus-strand RNA has been observed. According to our model only blocking of RNA transcription leads to an immediate biphasic decline of total plus-strand RNA. The observed biphasic plus-strand RNA decline with the introduction of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is in agreement with our model results when enhanced degradation of free plus-strand RNA is assumed as the mode of action of siRNA. Interestingly, we predict a transient plus-strand RNA decline (that last for about 14 days of treatment) when partial blocking of the formation of the intermediate transcription complexes occurs. Conclusions: Modeling HCV plus-stranded RNA viral kinetics during treatment in cell culture can shed light on the molecular mode of action of a given drug. According to our model, monitoring intermediate components of HCV replication (e.g. plusstrand RNA not attached to host ribosomes, and minus-stranded RNA) with frequent data sampling during the first hours of therapy will allow a better definition of different antiviral modes of action. In addition, the predicted transient decline of plus-strand RNA is reminiscent of the transient HCV RNA decline observed in patients treated with ribavirin monotherapy. In summary, our model can serve as an important tool in designing and evaluating new antivirals against HCV.",

This region is the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and its activity depends on associated cellular proteins. In the literature, a lymphotropic HCV mutant (G107A, G204A, G243A) has been repeatdly tested at a functional level (Lerat, J Virol 2000; Laporte; J Virol, 2002; Forton, J Virol 2004) showing differences of translational activity according to cell types analyzed. Our aim was to evaluate the extend of such isolated observations. Patients and Methods: The almost complete HCV IRES (17-371) could be amplified in 15 na\u00efve monoinfected subjects in plasma, in blood mononuclear cells (BMC)and in liver (n\u03ed3). Sequences were compared by SSCP and by line probe assay (InoLipa II). The IRES was subcloned in the pIRF vector between the F and the R luciferase reporter genes, transfected in HuH7 and were analyzed by classical dual luciferase assay. The ratio between R and F luciferase was calculated.Results: The IRES were different (more than 4 mutations) between PBMC and plasma in 7/15 tested patients. Nucleotidic sequence analysis of cloned IRES showed a genotypic compartmentalization in 2/7 patients (genotype 3 in plasma and 1 in BMC or genotype 1 in plasma and 3 in BMC) while the same genotypes was observed in both compartments in the 5 others. Plasma and liver strains were almost identical and distinct from PBMC strains in all 3 cases analyzed. Northern blot eliminated the existence of internal promoter in cloned IRES. In all 7 cases, the R/F established in triplicate in HuH7 was significantly higher (at least twice)for hepatocyte-specific IRES than for BMC-specific IRES. Abovecited set of mutations were identified in only one of these 7 patients. In conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that the cellular tropism of HCV is frequently regulated at a translational level and that mutations observed in the IRES of lymphotrope or hepatotrope strains correspond to a cell-type adaptation. However, compartmentalization of HCV IRES is not constant suggesting that other mechanisms than IRES adaptation are involved in the cellular tropism of HCV Disclosures: Cyrille Feray -Discussion will include off-label / investigative use of medicine(s), medical devices or procedure(s) Gaetana Di Liberto -No relationships to disclose Guillaume Fallot -No relationships to disclose Patrick Marcellin -No relationships to disclose Annie Cahour -No relationships to disclose Anne-Marie Roque-Afonso -No relationships to disclose",

B7-H1 (PD-L1) is a B7-family molecule that binds to programmed death-1 (PD-1). Recently, PD-L1 expression was reported on murine non-parenchymal liver cells, and accumulation of CD8\u03e9 T-cells and accelerated experimental autoimmune hepatitis were observed in PD-L1 deficient mice. Absence of PD-1 induced proliferation of T cells in adenovirus-infected livers and resulted in a rapid clearance of the virus. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression and function of PD-L1 in hepatocytes.Methods: Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were isolated from healthy human liver specimens obtained during resection of liver metastasis from surrounding non-tumorous tissue. In addition, 3 different hepatoma cell lines(HepG2, Hep3B and PLC)and Jurkat lymphocytes were analyzed. For coincubation experiments hepatoma cells were stimulated with Interferon (IFN)-alpha or -gamma for 24h and carefully washed before the addition of Jurkat cells. PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by real time PCR and FACS. Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by Trypan blue exclusion and FACS. Results: PHH as well as hepatoma cells expressed PDL1-mRNA and protein. Stimulation by activated lymphocytes, IFN-alpha or -gamma enhanced PDL-1 expression dose-and time-dependently (up to 50fold, 9h after stimulation w/10e5 U/ml IFN-alpha).

Petersen, U. of Florida). Finally, the effect of IL-15 on Hep and OV viability was assessed with the CCK-8 assay kit (Dojindo, MD). Results: Hepatic IL-15 mRNA levels increased comparably (about 1.8-fold) in acute and chronic liver injury. Treating healthy mice with IL-15 did not effect hepatocyte apoptosis (apoptotic index \u03fd 1/10 hpf in both groups) but increased hepatocyte mitosis almost 4-fold (3.8 versus 0 mitoses/10 hpf) and also increased OV by about 50% (P \u03fd 0.03 for control vs. IL-15). In vitro, both Hep and OV expressed IL-15 and all three IL-15 receptor subunits at the mRNA and protein levels. OV expressed 2.5 times more IL-15 than Hep. The cell lines expressed similar levels of IL-15R\u2423, but IL-15R\u2424 (OV \u03fe Hep) and IL-15R\u2425 (Hep \u03fe OV) were differentially expressed. Under our culture conditions, IL-15 did not influence viability of either Hep or OV. Conclusion: Healthy livers express IL-15 and induce IL-15 during liver injury. Local sources of IL-15 include hepatocytes and their progenitors. Although these cells express IL-15 receptors, IL-15 does not directly enhance their viability in culture. Nevertheless, IL-15 treatment significantly increases hepatic regenerative activity in healthy mice. Thus, IL-15 is hepatotrophic, and its induction in injured livers might promote liver repair.

Several studies have tried to determine how these mutations cause disease. Using cDNA constructs of wild type and mutant versions of ABCB11, these studies have concluded that these mutations cause abnormal trafficking of the BSEP protein.

Schena, Nefrologia Universita' Bari, Bari, Italy; Antonio Francavilla, Gastroenterologia Universita' Bari, Bari, ItalyHepatis C virus (HCV) infection is very common among patients on haemodialysis and in some transplant Centres this conditionrepresents a contraindication to kidney transplant. As it is well known, IFN therapy is not recommended after renal transplant due to the increased incidence of chronic rejection and graft failure. Furthermore, Ribavirin use is contraindicated for the increased risk of haemolytic anemia and renal impairment. The beneficial effect of the IFN\u03e9Riba therapy in liver transplanted pts with HCV recurrence, demonstrated that the combined antiviral therapy doesn't modify the immunobiologic state of transplanted pts achieving viral eradication in about 50% of pts when all the genotype are considered. Aim of the Study: Aim of the study is to determine 1) the efficacious dose of Ribavirin which doesn't adversely affect the anemic state of the patients and 2) to test the clinical efficacy of the IFN\u03e9Riba therapy accordingly to the haemathologic state of the patients Patients and Methods: Twentyfive na\u00efve HCV pts on chronic dialysis and in waiting list for renal transplant were enrolled. In all cases transaminases were mild elevated. All were positive for HCV-RNA and the mean viral load was 310327\u03ee257147 IU/ml. HCV genotype 1b was detected in 50% of pts. Liver histology revealed a mild disease in all pts (grade1, stage1-2).The time that pts were on dialysis ranged from 2 to 16 years. All were in treatment with Epo at the beginning of therapy. The antiviral schedule consisted of Peg-IFN alpha-2a, 135 g/week and Riba 200 mg/day for 48 weeks. Results: Twentyone/25 pts completed study treatment. Four pts were discontinued for non compliance in 2 cases and for inefficacy at week 12 in the other cases. Therapy was clinically well tolerated. The main expected biochemical drawbacks was mild to severe anaemia which was controlled in all cases with reduction in Ribavirin dose (200mg on every other day) and by increasing EPO. A 1st virological analysis made at week 12, showed: 19 pts (90%) was HCV-RNA Neg. This results has been maintained until the end of the study. AST returned normal in all patients. Post-treatment F-Up is ongoing. Conclusion: Combined therapy with Peg-IFN\u03e9Riba seems a feasible option in the particular setting of haemodialysis patients waiting for renal transplant. A careful pt monitoring is recommended as regards the anemic state. Surprisingly, up to 90% of pts avhieved a viral negativization thus suggesting that in these pts the sensibility of the virus to antiviral therapy is quite different in respect to non haemodialyzed pts.No  relationships to disclose Francesco Losito -No relationships to disclose Antonio Schena -No relationships to disclose Giovanni Stallone -No relationships to disclose Francesco Schena -No relationships to disclose Antonio Francavilla -No relationships to disclose 853 FIBROSIS STAGE IS NOT A PREDETERMINANT OF SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS IN PREVIOUS INTERFERON (IFN)-RIBAVIRIN (RIBA) TREATMENT FAILURES RECEIVING PEG-INTERFERON-ALFA 2B/RIBA WEIGHT BASED DOSING: RESULTS FROM THE EPIC3 PROGRAM Ruben Terg, Hospital Municap de Gastroenterologia Dr. Bonorino Udaondo, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Eugene Schiff, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL; Ricardo Moreno, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain; Fernando Goncales, Hospital das Clinicas da Unicamp, Campinas, Brazil; Steven Flamm, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL; Moises Diago, Hospital Gernal Universitario de Valencia, Valencia, Spain; Juerg Reichen, Institut fuer klinische Pharmakologie, Bern, Switzerland; Jenny Heathcote, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada; Thomas McGarrity, Milton S.

We have previously reported an SVR of 21% for these patients. Aim: To compare the safety of administering PEG-IFN-\u24232b and RIBA in subjects with moderate and advanced fibrosis. Methods: Subjects received PEG-IFN-\u24232b 1.5 g/kg subcutaneously once weekly plus RIBA 800-1400 mg/day WBD for up to 48 weeks. All patients had pre-treatment liver biopsies scored by a single reviewer using METAVIR criteria. Adverse events (AE) and safety laboratories (hematology, chemistries) were assessed at screeningand treatment weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42and 48. Results: 1964 subjects have initiated treatment; 568 F2, 580 F3 and806 F4. Subjects have completed a median of 133 days of treatment; 33% have completed 48 weeks of treatment. No new or unexpected AE have been reported in this population with moderate-severe fibrosis. The slight increase in dose modifications (MOD) for F4 subjects represented minimal increases in a variety of indications, primarily an increase in the frequency of MOD for thrombocytopenia forF4 subjects (5%) compared to F2 or 3 subjects (1% and 2%, respectively). Hematologic and chemical parameters were similar between the groups except platelet values; F4 subjects (58;7%) were more likely than F2/3 (14;1%) subjects to decrease to \u03fd50x10 3 /L. \u03fd1%) regardless of METAVIR score. Similar patterns of events and laboratory findings were observed for subjects discontinuing on or before week 18. Conclusions: Overall, F2, F3 and F4 subjects have similar rates of discontinuation, MOD and AE including serious adverse events, with the exception that cirrhotic subjects were more likely to experience MOD due to thrombocytopenia due to the lower baseline values in these subjects. Retreatment with PEG-IFN-\u24232b plus WBD RIBA is safe for subjects with advanced disease.Disclosures: Ruben Terg -Other Relationships: Investigator, Discussion will include off-label / investigative use of medicine(s), medical devices or procedure(s) Eugene Schiff -Speakers Bureau(s):Schering Plough ResearchInstitute, Consultant for: Schering Plough Research Institute, Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Moises Diago -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Fernando Goncales -Other Relationships: Investigator-Schering Plough Research Institute Steven Flamm -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Ricardo Moreno -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Juerg Reichen -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Jenny Heathcote -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Thomas McGarrity -Other Relationships: Investigator, Schering Plough Research Institute Thomas Berg -Other Relationships: Schering Plough Research Institute-Investigator Hugo Tanno -Other Relationships: Schering Plough Research Institute-Investigator Angelo Mattos -Other Relationships: Schering Plough Research Institute-Investigator John McHutchison -Consultant for: Schering Plough Research Institute, Other Relationships: Schering Plough Research Institute-Investigator Thierry Poynard -Consultant for: Schering Plough Research Institute, Other Relationships: Schering Plough Research Institute-Investigator Pierre Bedossa -Consultant for: Schering Plough Research Institute Louis Griffel -Employee of: Schering Plough Research Institute, Stock Holder of: Schering Plough Margaret Burroughs -Employee of: Schering Plough Research Institute, Stock Holder of: Schering Plough Clifford Brass -Employee of: Schering Plough Research Institute, Stock Holder of: Schering Ploug Janice Albrecht -Employee of: Schering Plough Research Institute, Stock Holder of: Schering Plough Peter Savino -Employee of: Schering Plough Research InstituteIntroduction:The EPIC 3 program includes a large, prospective, controlled trial designed to understand the safety and efficacy of re-treatment of subjects who have significant fibrosis (Metavir F2-F4) with PEG-IFN \u24232b and ribavirin weight based dosing for 48 weeks in previous treatment failures to any IFN-\u2423 and ribavirin therapy.

We report on the 1964 (568 F2, 580 F3, 806 F4) patients who have been treated to date. Results: Most patients (94%) had decreases in their platelet count with only 3% having drops greater than 60%. The median decrease was 30%. Less than 5% of subjects experienced platelet count decreases of more than 60%. There were no differences in the percentage drop of any level between F2, F3 or F4 patients. While the median time to nadir platelet count was treatment week 18, 23% of patients reached their nadir at treatment week 36 or later; with 7% reaching their nadir at week 48.Of patients with a baseline platelet count of \u03fe150x10 3 /L, only 4 (\u03fd1%) had a decrease to \u03fd 50 x10 3 /L; all were F4. Of those with a baseline count of 100-149 x10 3 /L, 37 (8%) had decreases to \u03fd 50 x10 3 /L; 1 F2, 5 F3 and 31 F4. Of those with a baseline level of \u03fd99 x10 3 /L 31 (28%) had decreases to \u03fd50 x10 3 /L; 3 F2, 5 F3 and 23 F4. Conclusions: Thrombocytopenia occurs at a similar rate in patients in patients with CHC undergoing treatment with PEG-IFN \u24232b and ribavirin independent of their level of baseline fibrosis. In total, 58/806 (7%) F4 patients reached dose reduction criteria of platelets \u03fd50 x10 3 /L, while only 10/580 (2%) F3 patients and 4/568 (\u03fd1%) F2 patients reached this level. These differences are due to the lower baseline values in the F4 subjects, who were more likely to require dose reductions.Disclosures:Louis Griffel -Employee of: Schering-Plough Research Institute, Stock Holder of: Schering-Plough,Discussion will include off-label / investigative use of medicine(s), medical devices or procedure(s)855 MINIMAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MID) IN VITALITYSCORE; A NEW OUTCOME MEASURE IN HCV TREATMENT TRIALS.

Mice with HCV titres104-107 copies/ml received 1350 IU/gram body INFalpha,(n\u03ed18 X 2 wk; n\u03ed4 X 4 wk) or saline (n\u03ed16 X 2 wk; n\u03ed4 X 4 wk) by IM daily. Nine mice received 10mg/kg bid orally of the protease inhibitor BILN2061for 4 (n\u03ed3) or 7(n\u03ed6) days. Mice with increasing titre (after initial drop) despite ongoing treatment with BILN2061 had RT-PCR products from plasma/liver sequenced to evaluate development of viral escape mutations as previously reported in the replicon system during BILN 2061 administration. Results: INF resulted in a consistent decrease in viral titre of 0.7, 1.1, and 2.0 log after 1, 2 and 4 wk (P\u03fd0.01 at all time points vs control). Therapy with BILN2061 resulted in viral titres dropping mean 2 log after 4 and 1.2 log after 7 days (P\u03fd0.0001 BILN2061 vs. vehicle, P\u03fd0.03 /BILN vs. INF). The D168V mutation previously reported to be associated with resistance to BILN2061 in replicon cultures (J. Virol. (2003) 77:3669) was not found in the sera or liver. Pre-existing mutants (Q80K) with partial resistance to BILN2061 were identified.Conclusions: Results with INF and BILN2061 therapy of HCV infection in the KMT mouse model of HCV infection parallel reported outcomes in clinical application(Nature 426:186, 2003), validating the KMT model for evaluation of potential anti-HCV therapeutics. HCV escape mutations previously reported during BILN2061 treatment of HCV replicons in vitro were not seen in this in vivo system. This system should help advance into human trials, lead compounds with an increased likelihood of clinical success while broadening the tools available for study of the biology of HCV infection.

Oral doses of isatoribine are poorly absorbed in multiple species. The prodrug ANA975 was developed to improve oral delivery of isatoribine to systemic circulation.Methods: Toxicology studies, including GLP oral multiple-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys, were performed to enable clinical studies. An open label, rising dose level, single-dose study in healthy volunteers was performed in the United Kingdom according to institutional and local regulatory requirements. Thirty-six subjects each received a single oral dose of ANA975 administered as a 5mg/mL solution in the fasted state at doses of 400mg (n\u03ed6), 800mg (n\u03ed18), or 1200mg (n\u03ed12). Results: Oral administration of ANA975 to monkeys resulted in efficient systemic delivery of isatoribine; the highest tolerated dose in monkey achieved plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC) values 6-13x higher than achieved with the 800mg IV dose in the clinical POC study. Monkeys showed a dose-related OAS induction in blood that persisted with once daily dosing for treatment periods up to at least 28 days. Single oral doses of ANA975 were well tolerated by healthy volunteers. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) and no withdrawals from the study. A total of 15 AEs were reported by 13 of 36 subjects. All reported AEs were mild (13 events) or moderate (2 events) in severity. The Investigator considered 1 AE (mild transient increase in CPK at 800mg) to be possibly related to ANA975 and all other AEs to be unlikely related or not related to ANA975. There were no reports of gastrointestinal AEs or flu-like syndrome. ANA975 was rapidly and extensively converted to isatoribine, with isatoribine Cmax typically occurring within 1 hour post-dose. At the highest tested dose, which has an isatoribine dose content of 988mg, plasma isatoribine AUC values (range 23-40, median 27mg*h/L) were similar to those observed in the clinical POC study with daily 1-hour IV infusions of isatoribine 800mg (first dose AUC range 19-38, median 24mg*h/L). The similarity of AUC values at comparable molar doses of oral ANA975 and IV isatoribine indicates that fractional oral absorption and conversion of ANA975 to isatoribine was very high. Conclusion: ANA975 is an efficient oral prodrug that achieves plasma isatoribine exposures comparable to those previously shown to reduce plasma HCV RNA in chronically infected patients",

Aim: Assess persistence of HCV among patients successfully treated with PEG-IFN \u03e9 RBV. Methods: 25 randomly selected CHC patients with sustained virological response (SVR) after full PEG-IFN \u03e9 RBV treatment were included. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected 6 to 56 months (mean, 22 months) after end of therapy (EOT). 13/25 patients underwent a second collection at 13 to 49 months after therapy (mean, 28 months). PBMC were cultured for 48 hours under mi-togen and cytokine stimulation. Presence of HCV RNA was determined by sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction of the 5'UTR. Institutional Review Board approved study. All patients provided written informed consent. Statistical analysis: Student's t test was used to compare means between groups; Chi square or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical data. Results: Demographics: 14 female, 11 male; mean age -52 years (range, 30-73); genotype 1-14 patients (56%). All patients underwent full course of antiviral treatment: 48 weeks for genotype 1 and 24 weeks for genotypes 2 or 3 and fulfilled SVR criteria. None of the 25 patients had detectable HCV RNA in sera by commercial qualitative PCR assay or by in-house RT-PCR of similar sensitivity and specificity at all time-points studied after EOT. HCV RNA was detected in PBMC cultures from 5 patients (20%); 3/25 during the first PBMC collection and 2/13 patients during second PBMC collection. No patient was positive on both PBMC collections. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in CHC patients, HCV RNA may persist in PBMC for 35 months after fulfilling SVR criteria following therapy with PEG-IFN\u03e9 RBV. RNA persistence in PBMC and sera was lower among our patients than reported among those treated with standard IFN \u03e9 RBV. At present the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. It is possible that viral persistence, and specifically presence of PBMC HCV RNA may lead to HCV reactivation. Conversely, it may also provide a low level of antigen exposure to keep immune status that would prevent reactivation phenomenon (This work was supported by grant provided by Roche Inc.)Disclosures:Vijayan Balan -Grant / Research Support by: Roche, Schering, Human Genome Sciences, Intermune, Sciclone, Idun, Idenix, Discussion will include off-label / investigative use of medicine(s), medical devices or procedure(s)Juan Gallegos -No relationships to disclose Marianne Rosati -No relationships to disclose Hugo Vargas -No relationships to disclose Jorge Rakela -Grant / Research Support by: Roche941 HCV UP-REGULATES TGF\u24241 AND AFFECTS ITS PATHWAY MEMBERS IN HCV-INFECTED HUMAN LIVERS AND MODEL SYSTEMS Jose L.

Branch, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NYBackground/Aims: During chronic HCV infection, some pathogenic effects are specific to HCV infection, while others reflect general liver injury. To identify gene expression changes that are specific to HCV infection, we cross-filtered mRNA profiles obtained through microarray analysis of human livers with parallel data from model systems of HCV replication and gene expression. This approach allows the direct and indirect consequences of HCV infection to be distinguished and enhances understanding of HCV pathogenesis. Methods: Using transcriptional profiling by single-color microarray (30-mer, Human CodeLink 10K), mRNA expression patterns were determined in HCV-infected human livers, in Huh-7 cell lines (stably expressing T7 polymerase) transfected with pH77, a full length infectious genotype 1b HCV construct that is under the control of the T7 promoter, and in HepG2 cells stably transfected with an HCV-1b core gene. Patterns were compared with those of appropriate controls (normal human liver, and Huh-7 and HepG2 cells transfected with empty vectors). Expression of selected genes that were up-or down-regulated by 1.8-fold or more in HCV materials versus controls was confirmed by real-time PCR. Results: Of the 10,000 genes profiled, 22 were up-regulated and 51 were down-regulated by at least 1.8-fold in HCV-infected human livers and in the pH77 transfected Huh7 cells. Microarray results were highly reproducible. The correlation coefficient among five human liver specimens was 0.92. The 73 differentially-expressed genes included TGF-\u24241, which was up-regulated, and a number of genes whose expression is known to be co-coordinately regulated with TGF-\u24241, such as SIP1/ZEB-2, integrin \u00a3]4, p42/p44 MAPK, and ILGFBP1, which were up-regulated; and cyclin b, which was down-regulated. ILGFBP1 was also up-regulated in HepG2 cells expressing the HCV core protein. Because of the predominance of the TGF-\u24241 pathway among the differentially regulated genes, realtime PCR analysis was conducted on mRNA from pH77 and control cells; this method confirmed the microarray results.Conclusions: HCV expression significantly stimulates TGF-\u24241 gene expression. TGF-\u24241 exerts biologically relevant effects in human livers and in model systems, altering downstream genes in a relevant manner. These coordinate changes in gene expression may play an important role fibrosis and may also contribute to chronic infection by modulating immune responses.

Recently, it was shown that autophagosome-likedouble membrane vesicle is required for viral RNA replication and double membrane vesicles formation significantly enhances the efficiency of replication in coronavirus and poliovirus. Here, we investigate the role of autophagy in HCV RNA replication. Methods: A cell line transfected with HCV replicon expressing selectable chimeric reporter protein of neomycin phosphotransferase and firefly luciferase were cultured in D-MEM media containing 10% FCS (Huh7/Rep-Feo; Tanabe, J Infect Dis 2004, grateful gifted from Naoya Sakamoto and Nobuyuki Enomoto). 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, or mixture of E64d and pepstatin A, which inhibit lysosomal proteases, was added into medium of Huh7/Rep-Feo, and levels of HCV replication was analyzed by luciferase assay. To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of 3-methyladenine, E64d and pepstatin A, MTS assays were performed. Double membrane vesicle of Huh7 and Huh7/Rep-Feo were identified and counted by using transmittion electron microscope. Results: Replication level of HCV replicon was increased to about two-fold after 18 hours, however, incubation with 10mM 3-methyladenine blunted increases in replication of HCV replicon completely. Moreover, 10mg/ml of E64d and 10mg/ml of pepstatin A decreased replication of HCV replicon to about 66% of control. MTS assays of the cells treated with 3-methyladenine or E64d and pepstatin A showed no significant effect of on cell viability. On the other hand, double membrane vesicle was identified 0.16 vacuoles/cells in Huh-7 cells, however, transfection of HCV replicon increased the number of vacuole to about 2.5-fold over untransfected Huh-7 cells. Conclusion: HCV replicon increases in autophagosome-like double membrane vesicles formation. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal proteases decreased replication of HCV replicon. It is thus posturated that the replication of HCV replicon utilized a machinery involving cellular autophagy.increase hepatic inflammation and hepatic cytokines in this model. FACS analysis of infiltrating hepatic immune cells in TFA-S100-immunized BALB/c mice demonstrated CD45\u03e9 GR-1\u03e9 surface markers, suggesting neutrophils. Moreover, MIP-2 measured in liver supernatants by ELISA was significantly increased (p\u03fd0.001) in these mice when compared to IL-4 KO mice, suggesting that IL-4 increases increases MIP-2 expression and significant neutrophilic inflammation following immunization in BALB/c mice. Serum analysis for anti-hapten antibodies demonstrated significantly increased IgG1 (p \u03fd 0.001), but not IgG2a subclass antibbodies in BALB/c mice, when compared to IL-4 KO mice, further suggesting that IL-4 increases serum TFA IgG1 antibodies that correlate with hepatic inflammation. In conclusion, these studies suggest a critical role for IL-4 and MIP-2 in the development of immune-mediated injury in IDDIH.Supported by AARDADisclosures:The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Dolores Njoku, Jennelle Mellerson, Noel Rose946 LIVER DAMAGE AND LETHALITY DURING GROUP-A-STREPTOCOCCUS INDUCED SEPTIC SHOCK IS REDUCED BY DELETING IL-6/GP130 SIGNALING IN HEPATOCYTESChristian Klein, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Oliver Goldmann, E Medina, GBF, Braunschweig, Germany; Michael P.

The negative APR is characterized by the suppression of hepatic genes involved in many Retinoid X receptor \u2423 (RXR\u2423)-regulated critical hepatic functions including bile formation and endobiotic/xenobiotic metabolism.LPS-mediated negative APR is a key component in the pathophysiological progression of inflammation-based liver diseases, yet no effective therapeutics exist. Recent evidence suggests that Rosiglitazone (Rosi), a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u2425 (PPAR\u2425) agonist, has anti-inflammatory activities, yet any effects on LPS-mediated suppression of RXR\u2423-regulated hepatocyte genes remains unknown. We hypothesize that Rosi attenuates the suppression of RXR\u2423-regulated hepatic genes by LPS. Methods:Male C57BL/6 mice were gavage-fed 50 mg/kg of Rosi or corn oil (Veh) daily for 3 days prior to LPS (2 g/g) injection. Livers were harvested 1-16 hours thereafter, and RNA for several RXR\u2423-regulated genes was analyzed by real-time PCR, and RXR\u2423 heterodimer binding activities and nuclear quantities were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and immunoblotting. Using the in vitro model of the negative APR (IL-1\u2424 treatment of HepG2 cells), pre-treatment with Rosi (10 M) for 30 minutes was followed by IL-1\u2424, and harvested 15-360 minutes later for nuclear evaluation of RXR\u2423 by EMSA and immunoblots.

We previously have shown that RAGE blockade suppresses failure of regeneration after massive hepatectomy. In the liver, RAGE is principally expressed in mononuclear phagocyte-derived dendritic cells (MPDDC). Here, we explored the role of ligand-RAGE interaction on the properties of MPDDC. Methods: We isolated primary murine MPDDC, Kupffer cells (KC) and hepatocytes from mice to test RAGE expression in key parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Results: Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that RAGE was expressed to the highest degree in MP-DDC, and to a lesser extent in KC and was not detected in hepatocytes. We tested the hypothesis that RAGE mediated inflammatory signals in injured liver derived largely from MPDDC. MPDDC were isolated from WT and RAGE null mice and incubated with prototypic RAGE ligand, S100b (20 g/ml) for 4 and 10 hrs. In WT cells, an 4.7 and 10.4-fold increase in TNF-alpha transcripts, respectively, was noted vs incubation with PBS. In contrast, in MPDDC isolated from RAGE null mice, no increase in TNF-alpha transcripts was noted in the presence of S100b. LPS (10 ng/ml) was incubated with WT and RAGE null MPDDC for 10 hrs. Although WT MPDDC revealed a significant increase in TNFalpha and IL-6 transcripts, significantly decreased transcripts were noted in LPS RAGE null MPDDC. As LPS is not a ligand for RAGE, we tested the premise that LPS triggered generation/ release of RAGE ligand HMGB1. After 6 hrs incubation of MP-DDC with LPS (100 ng/ml), a 2-fold increase in HMGB1 antigen in supernatant was noted vs PBS-treatment. Consistent with the premise that RAGE stimulated proinflammatory signals in MP-DDC in vivo, six hours after massive hepatectomy, transcripts for TNF-alpha and IL-6 were increased in MPDDC, but not from MPDDC isolated from sham-treated WT or RAGE null mice (3.0 vs 1.0 and 3.3 vs 0.48 fold, respectively, p\u03fd0.05). Conclusion: These data suggest that liver MPDDC play a prominent role in RAGEdependent mechanisms that exacerbate inflammation in liver injury. The ligand-RAGE axis is a prominent pathway linked to autocrine/paracrine induction of inflammatory signals by MP-DDC.

Since many of the obese patients are prone to develop NASH, it would be of obvious importance to determine whether in these subjects MCT aggravates the hepatic pathology and, in the affirmative, at what level of intake and through which mechanism. Conclusion: Contrary to expectations, given as iscaloric replacement for corn oil, MCT exacerbated liver injury in a rat model of NASH, contrasting with many reports of its hepatoprotective effect against alcoholic liver injury. Accordingly, the practice of dispensing MCT to NASH patients should be reassessed.[Supported by a Merit Review Grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs]Disclosures:The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Charles Lieber, Maria Leo, Qi Cao, Ki Mak, Chaoling Ren, Anatoly Ponomarenko, Xiaolei Wang, Leonore DeCarli953 DIETARY CURCUMIN PREVENTS DOWNREGULATION OF HEPATIC TRANSPORTER GENE EXPRESSION BY LPS Astrid Kosters, Ajay Gulati, Sundararajah Thevananther, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; Jaap Mulder, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Richard Von Furstenburg, Tracy Zimmerman, Romi Ghose, Saul Karpen, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TXBackground: Inflammation caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to the downregulation of hepatic transporter gene expression which results in cholestasis. In vivo studies from multiple groups have shown that the main contributor to LPS-mediated reduction of transporter gene expression is diminished activity of key transcriptional regulators, many of which are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. Previous studies indicated that curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice turmeric, inhibited cytokine-activated suppression of NR-regulated gene expression in vitro. In this study, we sought to determine if the downregulation of hepatic transporter gene expression by LPS could be prevented in mice fed a curcumin-containing diet. Methods: Male C57Bl/6 mice (n\u03ed5 per group) were fed either a 4% w/w curcumin diet or normal chow for 10 days, after which mice were IP-injected with LPS (2 g/g BW) or vehicle (0.9% saline). Livers were isolated 16 hrs after injection and RNA levels were analyzed by Real-time PCR. DNA-binding activity of nuclear extracts to NR binding sites was assessed by gel shift assays. Results: In chow-fed mice LPS-treatment for 16 hours significantly reduced hepatic expression of the sinusoidal bile acid importer (Ntcp) and the canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep) to 15\u03ee4% and 14\u03ee7% of control mice respectively. LPS-treatment also significantly decreased hepatic expression of the multidrug-resistance (associated) proteins Mrp2 (26\u03ee14%), Mrp3 (45\u03ee14%) and Mdr2 (66\u03ee7%) and of Oatp2 (27\u03ee21%). RNA levels of Abcg5, Mdr1b and PXR were not affected by LPS. Expression of CAR was reduced to 52\u03ee33%, while Cyp3a11, primarily involved in the metabolism of numerous toxins including retained hydrophobic bile salts, was reduced to 18\u03ee4% after LPS treatment. In mice fed the curcumin-diet prior to the LPS treatment, expression of all 8 genes that were significantly suppressed by LPS treatment was at, or near, control levels. Notably, Ntcp and Bsep RNA levels were maintained at 78\u03ee50% and 60\u03ee46% of control levels, respectively.",

At MVA female sex, younger age, absent-mild steatosis, absence of cirrhosis and LTR to IFN were significantly and independently associated with a better outcome. In baseline cirrhotic pts, at MVA LTR was significantly associated with the absence of ESC except HCC. Conclusions: In HBeAg negative CHB standard IFN therapy warrants an overall LTR of 20%; a correct identification of SR requires a long term follow-up as relapse may occur late.

            "text": "Introduction: In HCV 1a/b-infected patients, foci of amino acid mutations in NS5A associated with response to interferon-based treatment were identified around V3 region. In HCV 1-infected patients receiving Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin amino acid sequence of carboxyterminal part of NS5A including V3 region was now investigated the correlation of local accumulation of amino acid variations with virologic response and viral dynamics. Methods: 78 patients (HCV 1a n\u03ed21; HCV 1b n\u03ed57) were enrolled. All patients participated in the DITTO international multicenter trial and received Peginterferon alfa-2a (180g) plus ribavirin (1000-1200mg/day) for at least 24 weeks. HCV-RNA was frequently quantified during the first 4 weeks of treatment and patients were classified as rapid, slow, flat, or null responders according to their viral kinetic pattern. Local accumulations of differences to consensus sequence were analyzed on the basis of a nonparametric binomial regression model, assuming independent amino acid exchanges. For comparison of the total number of variations of all or specific sequences, Kruskal Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test were applied. A specific testing procedure based on smoothed mutational frequencies was applied in order to determine if there are local or global differences between groups and to determine if differences are due to local differences between the groups in addition to possible global differences in mutational frequency, respectively. Results: Summarizing over the whole NS5A region as well as summarizing over predicted exposed amino acids, revealed a higher heterogeneity in patients with sustained virologic response (SVR) compared to patients without SVR (mean variations from the consensus sequence: .13 vs. .08 and .15 vs. .09; p\u03ed.02 and p\u03ed.01, respectively). Significant higher smoothed mutational frequencies indicating also local accumulations were found in HCV 1-a infected patients with SVR compared to patients without SVR and in patients with rapid, slow or flat response compared to patients with null response (p\u03fd.001 in each case). In HCV genotype 1a-infected patients, main focus of accumulation of mutations was observed around aa 2320, in HCV 1b-sequences between aa 2350 and 2370. Conclusion: In the present study, sustained virologic response to Peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy was significantly associated with a higher mutational frequency in the carboxy terminal part of NS5A. Two different mutational foci have been found in genotype 1a and 1b isolates upstream the V3 region. The functional role of these mutational foci on viral replication should be evaluated in the replicon system. Background: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by an accumulation of CD4 (\u03e9) T cells that are critical for the development of liver injury. Chemokines upregulated during liver inflammation have been implicated in the activation, recruitment, and retention of immune cells, including CD4 (\u03e9) T cells, within the liver in AIH. Specifically, the chemokines IP-10 and MIG recruit activated immune cells expressing their cognate receptor CXCR3 to inflammatory sites. Accordingly, we employed an experimental model of AIH resulting from Concanavalin A (ConA) administration to test our hypothesis that IP-10 and MIG play important, non-redundant roles in hepatic immune cell recruitment during experimental T cell mediated hepatitis. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were given ConA (or PBS vehicle) (13.0mg/kg IV) and sacrificed 1.5, 8, 24, and 48 hours after treatment. Plasma ALT levels were used to biochemically confirm hepatitis (maximal at 8-24 hours) and this was supported by histology. Levels of chemokine mRNA (RPA) and protein levels (ELISA) were analyzed. Hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed using FACS to identify hepatic CD4 (\u03e9) T cell populations. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against IP-10 or MIG were administered (50ug/mouse IV) 2 hours prior to ConA treatment. Results: Our results demonstrate that hepatic expression of IP-10 and MIG differ temporally; hepatic IP-10 levels increase 3-fold (p\u05450.001) above baseline by 90 minutes, and peak 8 hours after ConA treatment (3-fold increase; p\u05450.001). In contrast, hepatic MIG levels increase 32-fold above baseline at 8 hours (p\u05450.001), and remain elevated 7-fold (p\u05450.001) at 24 hours post-ConA. Interestingly, significant hepatic infiltration of CXCR3 expressing CD4 (\u03e9) T cells occurred only after 24 hrs post-ConA and correlated with increased total hepatic CXCR3 mRNA expression. Treatment with neutralizing IP-10 or MIG antibodies resulted in striking 25-fold (p\u05450.01) and 85-fold (p\u05450.01) reductions in ALT levels 24 hours post-ConA respectively and were associated with marked improvements in liver histology. Our findings support essential and non-redundant roles for IP-10 and MIG in the development of ConA hepatitis. Moreover, given that CXCR3 expressing CD4 (\u03e9) T cells are recruited \u03fe24 hrs post-ConA, our results suggest that IP-10 and MIG exert their proinflammatory effects in ConA hepatitis independent of recruitment of CXCR3 expressing CD4 (\u03e9) T cells. Background: During endotoxemia, hepatocellular transport and biliary secretion are markedly decreased, in large part due to proinflammatory cytokine mediated decrease in hepatic transporter levels. The Retinoid X Receptor \u2423, RXR\u2423, along with its heterodimer partners, are centrally involved in the transcriptional regulation of many hepatic transporters, as well as genes involved in detoxification. We have recently modeled this pathway in HepG2 cells, where IL-1\u2424 treatments lead to the rapid nuclear export of RXR\u2423 and subsequent decreased DNA binding of RXR\u2423containing heterodimers-however the fate of RXR\u2423 in response to IL-1\u2424 signaling has not yet been determined. We hypothesize that IL-1\u2424 induced cell signaling leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of RXR\u2423. Methods: HepG2 cells were cultured for 48 hours and serum starved for 16 hours prior to a 1 hour pretreatment with either DMSO (vehicle) or 10 M MG132 (proteasomal inhibitor) and then subjected to 10 ng/ml IL-1\u2424 or saline for 3 or 6 hours before nuclear, cytosolic or whole cell protein extracts were prepared. Extracts were then subject to western blot analysis for RXR\u2423. For ubiquitination analyses, HepG2 cells were transfected with GFP tagged RXR\u2423 (RXR\u2423-GFP) and a HA epitope tagged expression construct of either wild type ubiquitin (HA-UBQ) or a nonfunctioning ubiquitin (HA-mUBQ). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cultures were pretreated with either DMSO or MG132, and exposed to saline or IL-1\u2424 as noted, before harvest of protein extracts from 0.5 to 5 hours later. Immunoprecipitation of HA-UBQ-tagged proteins using an anti-HA antibody, was followed by western blotting for both native RXR\u2423 and transfected RXR\u2423-GFP. Results: Pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 completely blocked the reduction in whole cell levels of RXR\u2423 seen in response to IL-1\u2424. Similar results were noted in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Cell extracts obtained after MG132 pretreatment before exposure to IL-1\u2424 treatment showed a 4-fold increase in HA-UBQ-tagged RXR\u2423 compared to saline treatment. HA-UBQtagged RXR\u2423-GFP was increased 2-fold over saline by 30 minutes and remained high through 5 hours. No ubiquitinated RXR\u2423 or RXR\u2423-GFP bands were seen in either the DMSO pretreated cells or the cells expressing HA-mUBQ. Summary: Taken together, these data show a rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RXR\u2423 in response to IL-1\u2424 induced cell signaling providing a possible mechanism for the broad and sustained down-regulation of RXR\u2423-regulated gene targets in the inflamed liver.",

Studies suggest that IDDIH has immune and autoimmune features. Cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of organ-specific autoimmune diseases. While roles for chemokines in organ injury have also been demonstrated, few studies have investigated potential interactions between cytokines and chemokines in organ-specific autoimmune disease. Moreover, no studies have investigated the roles of these two components in the development of immune-mediated injury in IDDIH. We developed a novel murine model of immune-mediated hepatitis consisting of neutrophils and eosinophils with features resembling IDDIH using covalently modified hepatic proteins linked to a trifluoroacetyl (TFA) chloride hapten (TFA-S100) formed from CYP2E1 oxidative metabolism of halogenated volatile anesthetics or similar drugs. We found that hepatitis directly correlated with serum anti-hapten IgG1 antibodies. We postulate that in our model, significant neutrophilic inflammation is induced by IL-4-dependent expression of neutrophil chemoattractants, KC or macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2). Moreover, the formation of significant serum levels of anti-hapten antibodies is also IL-4-dependent. To test these hypotheses, we immunized IL-4 knockout (IL-4 KO) and wild-type (BALB/c) mice with TFA-S100 after institutional review board approval.

Methods: Virologic rebounds (confirmed \u05461 log increase from nadir by PCR) observed in patients from studies AI463-022 & AI463-027 (nucleoside na\u00efve), AI463-014 & AI463-026 (LVD refractory), and AI463-901 (extended treatment) were analyzed for emerging ETVr. Genotypic analysis compared patient HBV RT sequences with those at study entry and with WT HBV. Phenotypes of emerging substitutions were determined using antiviral assays measuring HBV DNA yields from HepG2 cells transfected with plasmids expressing patient RT sequences. Results: Among \u03fe650 nucleoside na\u00efve, HBeAg pos & HBeAg neg patients completing at least 24 wk of ETV therapy, 93% achieved HBV DNA reductions to \u03fd300 copies/ml.

Genotypic analysis of the 18 observed virologic rebounds (2 year treatment period) failed to show any evidence of emerging ETVr substitutions, with population pheno-Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV) is effective for both wild type (WT) and YMDD variant (YMDDv) HBV which is resistant to Lamivudine (LAM). While the majority of LAM resistant patients respond well to ADV, some patients show slow/poor antiviral responses and even have an increase in HBV DNA levels while on ADV therapy. We investigated if this poor/worsening response was the result of ADV resistance. Materials and Methods: 133 patients after LAM resistance, were treated with ADV for varying periods. Good responses to ADV were seen in 87/133 patients while 46 showed slow /poor virologic responses although biochemical improvement was noted. Pre-ADV and on-ADV therapy serum samples were available from 13/46 patients. For the remaining 33, Pre-ADV and on-ADV specimens were unavailable since HBV DNA levels were measured elsewhere. To understand the nature of slow/poor responses, HBV polymerase genotypes were investigated using an YMDD PCR-RFLP assay and sequencing of the HBV pol gene. The PCR-RFLP assay examined the presence of mutations at 2 sites (rtL180 and rtM204)). The sequencing assay assessed mutations at codons, rt180, rt181, rt204, and rt236. Analytes of the sequencing assay included genotype and PMUL and PMUA, polymerase mutants for LAM and for ADV respectively. These 13 patients were Asian Americans, aged 19-67 years, 9 males and 4 females. Treatment with LAM lasted 12-60 months until viral breakthroughs were noted. Median pre-ADV HBV DNA levels were 5 x 10 6 copies/mL (range 1.2 x 10 6 -2.5 x 10 8 ) while median on-ADV HBV DNA levels were 9 x 10 6 (range 1.7x 10 4 -8 x 10 6 ). The median duration of ADV therapy for 13 patients was 13 months (range 6-30). Results: Polymerase genotypes were examined on 10 pre-ADV and 13 on-ADV samples, all of HBV genotype C. Among 10 pre-ADV samples, 8 contained YMDDv HBV and 5/8 also contained a small portion of mixed population; surprisingly 2/10 had mostly WT-HBV although they had viral breakthrough. Following ADV therapy (6-30 months), 10/13 patients had a return of WT-HBV; 3 of these10 contained a small portion of YMDD and 3/13 had YMDDv-HBV. One patient with 18months on ADV, showed WT-HBV return mixed with ADV resistant HBV (N236T). It appeared that YMDDv-HBV were suppressed by ADV but in some WT-HBV was strong enough to return even under ADV effect. Conclusion: These results suggest that in patients with LAM resistance who did not respond well to ADV, the majority of poor responses were due to the return of WT HBV and not due to ADV resistance. Continuation of LAM in combination with ADV, at least for a period of time, may therefore be the preferred management in patients with LAM resistance.",

At present sequential monotherapy is standard of care, however combination therapy with at least two HBV-polymerase inhibitors is considered a promising alternative approach. It is unknown to date whether combination therapy with lamivudine plus tenofovir could be superior to sequential therapy with tenofovir after the occurrence of lamivudine resistance for chronic hepatitis B treatment in coinfected patients. We conducted a multicenter, 1:2 matched pair analysis comparing patients with HBV/HIV-coinfection starting an antiretroviral regimen including tenofovir plus lamivudine with patients who had highly replicative, lamivudine resistant hepatitis B (\u03fe 100,000 copies/mL) and started therapy with tenofovir as the only active HBV-polymerase inhibitor. Resistance to lamivudine was demonstrated by HBV-genotyping. The lower limit of detection of HBV-DNA was 1000 copies/mL. At baseline patients starting with tenofovir plus lamivudine (n\u03ed23) had a median HBV-DNA of 59,000,000 copies/mL compared to 120,000,000 copies/mL in the tenofovir arm (n\u03ed46) (p\u03ed0.75).

After 12 months and 24 months median HBV-DNA was \u03fd1000 copies/mL in patients taking either tenofovir plus lamivudine or tenofovir alone (p\u03ed0.46, p\u03ed0.24). A sustained undetectable HBV-DNA \u03fd1000 copies/mL was achieved in 19/23 (83%) patients on tenofovir plus lamivudine and in 38/46 (83%) patients on tenofovir (p \u03ed 1.00). A loss of HBe-antigen was observed in 7/22 HBe-antigen positive patients on tenofovir plus lamivudine and in 11/44 patients on tenofovir (p\u03ed0.57). HBs-antigen loss was found in 1/23 and 2/46 patients, respectively.In conclusion in this cohort of HBV/HIV-coinfected individuals, full virologic HBV-DNA suppression was achieved in the majority of patients independent of treatment allocation. In addition loss of HBe-and HBs-antigen was not different in both arms. Over a median observational period of 24 months tenofovir alone was as effective as tenofovir plus lamivudine in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients with highly replicative chronic hepatitis B.",

Besides rtM204V/I mutation, rtL80V/I and rtL180M mutations have been reported to be associated commonly in patients with LAM resistance. In this study, we intended to examine the effects of a certain type of mutations at polymerase domain of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) on the antiviral efficacy following adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) therapy in patients with LAMresistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: One hundred and nineteen patients with LAM-resistant CHB were treated with ADV at a dose of 10mg daily for \u03fe12 weeks. The entire polymerase domain of HBV in the sera obtained just before ADV therapy was sequenced using direct sequencing method. Genotypes of HBV were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) following polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum HBV-DNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR method. The antiviral responses, which were evaluated by the change of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV-DNA levels at 12 weeks following ADV therapy, were compared in relation to the preexisting mutations at HBV polymerase domain. Results: All of 119 subjects revealed to have HBV of genotype C. Out of them, 105 patients (88%) had YMDD mutations; 70 (67%) rtM204I, 28 (27%) rtM204V variant and 7 (6%) both. In addition to mutations at YMDD motif, rtL80V/I mutation was found in 70 (59%) and rtL180M in 72 (61%). The rtM204I variant was accompanied by rtL80V/I (p\u03fd0.001) and rtM204V was associated with rtL180M mutation more frequently (p\u03fd0.005). Median serum HBV DNA level at baseline was 7.82 log(10) copies/mL and the median change of serum HBV DNA levels from baseline were -2.40 log(10) copies/mL at week 12. The rate of serum ALT normalization was 42% following 12 weeks of ADV therapy. The rate of serum ALT normalization (45% vs. 35%; p\u03fd0.05) and the changes of serum HBV DNA level (median, -2.43 vs. -2.93 log(10) copies/mL; p\u03fd0.05) at 12 weeks following ADV therapy were not significantly differ-ent between patients with rtM204I and those with rtM204V variant. Very interestingly, the change of serum HBV-DNA levels was significantly greater in patients with rtL80V/I mutation compared with those without it. (Median, -2.10 vs. -2.83 log(10) copies/mL; p\u03fd0.05) However, the presence of rtL180M mutation did not affect the change of serum HBV-DNA level following ADV therapy. (Median, -2.53 vs. -2.20 log(10) copies/mL; p\u03fd0.05) Conclusions: It is suggested that rtL80V/I variants of HBV may associate with poor antiviral response to ADV therapy. Little is known about the patterns of HBV-DNA decline and their relation to response for chronic hepatitis B patients treated with alpha-interferon. To investigate different patterns in viral decline during treatment and follow-up, we analyzed 254 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PEG-IFN) 100 g/week for 52 weeks with or without lamivudine 100 mg/day. PEG-IFN dose was reduced to 50 g/ week after 32 weeks of treatment. Endpoints were HBeAg-negativity, HBV-DNA \u03fd 400 copies/ml and HBsAg negativity 26 weeks after therapy. The total trial population consisted of 266 patients. From 12 patients, insufficient HBV-DNA measurements were available to assess HBV-DNA patterns. In the patients treated with PEG-IFN monotherapy (n\u03ed124), 5 different patterns of viral decline could be recognized: a. early decline of at least 1 log during week 0-4 of therapy; b. delayed decline of at least 2 log from baseline HBV-DNA during week 4-32; c. late decline of at least 2 log between week 32 and 52; d. posttreatment decline of 2 log from baseline HBV-DNA after week 52; e. no substantial decline at any time point. Endpoints for these different patterns are shown in the table. A delayed rather than early viral decline was associated with highest response rates at the end of follow-up (HBeAg response 63% vs. 52%, respectively). Patients with a late or post treatment decline pattern had lower response rates (HBeAg response 31% and 27%, respectively). Interestingly, 7 out of 8 patients (88%) with HBsAg loss and all patients with HBV-DNA \u03fd400 copies/ml at the end of follow-up exhibited a delayed HBV-DNA decline. In the patients treated with combination therapy (n\u03ed130), a similar biphasic pattern of decline in HBV-DNA was seen in nearly all patients with a fast decline in the first four weeks and a slower decline thereafter. In conclusion, different patterns in HBV-DNA decline were found during PEG-IFN monotherapy. A delayed rather than early viral decline was associated with the highest response rate. This underlines the important immunomodulatory effect of PEG-IFN and the limited predictive value of early viral kinetics in PEG-IFN therapy for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Results: Most patients were of Asian origin (87%) and infected with HBV genotype C (59%) or B (28%). Response in Asian patients closely reflected overall results. Among Caucasians (n\u03ed79), the highest response rates were seen with peginterferon alfa-2a alone (50% 12 \u204424). Response rates were also high in patients with genotype A receiving peginterferon alfa-2a alone (52% 12 \u204423). Patients infected with genotype C or B had the same response to peginterferon alfa-2a alone (31% vs 30%). Response rates were higher in females than males in all treatment arms; 35% vs 31%, 37% vs 25%, and 26% vs 17% with peginterferon alfa-2a alone, combination therapy, and lamivudine alone. There was no clear relationship between patient age and response, regardless of treatment. In the two peginterferon alfa-2a arms, response rates were comparable in patients weighing \u054565 kg and \u03fe65 kg. Response rates in lamivudine-treated patients weighing \u054565 kg were slightly higher than in those \u03fe65 kg (22% vs16%). In MV analyses across all treatment arms, ethnicity, genotype, age and bodyweight were not significant predictors of response (P\u03ed0.757, \u05460.21, 0.716 and 0.790); gender was of borderline significance (P\u03ed0.077). Conclusion: Genotype was not a significant predictor of response by MV analysis. The rate of response was the same for patients with genotype B or C, the predominant genotypes in the study. This contrasts with previous studies of interferon-based therapy. Genotype A patients, who represented a minority of patients in our study, treated with peginterferon alfa-2a alone had the highest rate of HBeAg seroconversion at week 72. Gender had a marginal effect on response and this was mostly seen with combination therapy and lamivudine alone. Patient bodyweight had no effect on response to peginterferon alfa-2a.",

A single 3.0 mg/kg dose resulted in a 2.0 log 10 reduction in serum titers. Specific siRNA-mediated reduction of HBV RNA was observed in the liver. Furthermore, prolonged reductions were seen in serum HBV DNA with weekly siRNA dosing. Administration of the formulated siRNA did not induce cytokines (IFN\u2423, IFN\u2425, TNF\u2423, IL6), therefore indicating that the observed anti-HBV activity is siRNA-mediated. The potent activity was also correlated with improvements in delivery compared to unencapsulated siRNA.

It has been reported that a cumulative incidence for ADV resistance is 2% after 96 weeks of treatment in na?e patients. In this study, we analyzed the emergence rate of rtA181V and rtN236T and the effects of those mutants on antiviral response after 48 weeks of ADV therapy in patients with LAMresistant CHB. Methods: Fifty patients with LAM-resistant CHB were treated with ADV at a dose of 10mg daily and followed for over 48 weeks. The baseline and 48-week samples were analyzed for the presence of mutations at rt181 and rt236 of HBV polymerase by restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP) assay. The antiviral responses to therapy were evaluated by changes of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity, and, HBV-DNA levels at 48 weeks after ADV therapy. Serum HBV-DNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR method. Results: Of the fifty patients, YMDD mutations were identified in 44 patients (88%). Besides YMDD mutations, 3 patients had rtA181T before ADV therapy. After 48 weeks of ADV therapy, rtA181V/T and/or rtN236T mutations emerged in 9 (19%) out of the other 47 patients without mutations at rt181 or rt236 (rtA181V in 1 patients, rtA181T in 2, rtN236T in 3, rtA181V\u03e9rtN236T in 1, rtA181T\u03e9rtN236T in 2). There were no differences in age, gender, pre-ADV serum ALT, HBeAg positivity, and HBV DNA levels between patients with and without the mutants. The rates of normalization of serum ALT (67% vs. 47%) and loss of HBeAg positivity (10% vs. 12%) were not significantly different between two groups of patients (P\u03fd0.05). However, reduction of serum HBV-DNA levels was significantly less in patients with rtA181V/T or rtN236T than in those without the mutants (mean, -0.43 vs. -2.36 log(10)copies/mL) (P\u03fd0.001).",

            "text": "Background: Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates were originally developed to assess survival rates using death as the measured outcome. Recently, this statistical method has been used to assess the long-term efficacy of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A basic assumption of the KM approach is that a patient who achieves an outcome (eg death) will always have that outcome whether they remain in the study or not. Since relapse occurs in CHB, we discuss the appropriateness of the KM approach in determining response to anti-HBV therapy. Objective: To compare HBeAg response rates obtained using the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, which assumes that patients with missing data do not have a response, with rates obtained by KM estimation in patients enrolled in a large, randomized clinical trial. Methods: HBeAg-positive patients were treated for 48 weeks with 180 g peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (PEGASYS \u00ae ) once-weekly (qw) \u03e9 oral placebo once-daily (qd), 180 g peginterferon alfa-2a qw \u03e9 100 mg lamivudine qd, or 100 mg lamivudine qd. HBeAg seroconversion rates during treatment and up to 24 weeks posttreatment (week 72) were reanalyzed using the KM method.Results: HBeAg seroconversion rates at the end of treatment (week 48) in the ITT population were 27% 72 \u2044271 with peginterferon alfa-2a alone, 24% 64 \u2044271 with peginterferon alfa-2a \u03e9 lamivudine and 20% 55 \u2044272 with lamivudine alone. Corresponding KM estimates of HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 (day 337) were 36% with peginterferon alfa-2a (\u03e99% over ITT), 29% with combination therapy (\u03e95% over ITT) and 24% with lamivudine (\u03e94% over ITT). In the ITT population, HBeAg seroconversion rates 24 weeks post-treatment (week 72) were significantly higher with peginterferon alfa-2a alone (32% 87 \u2044271; P\u03fd0.001) and peginterferon alfa-2a \u03e9 lamivudine (27% 74 \u2044271; P\u03ed0.023) than with lamivudine alone (19% 52 \u2044272). KM estimates of HBeAg seroconversion rates at week 72 (day 504) were 43% with peginterferon alfa-2a (\u03e911% over ITT), 38% with the combination therapy (\u03e911% over ITT) and 30% with lamivudine (\u03e911% over ITT). Conclusions: Using data from this large, randomized study, estimated rates of HBeAg seroconversion generated using the KM method were substantially higher than the HBeAg seroconversion rates generated using an ITT analysis. These findings suggest that KM estimation is not an appropriate statistical method for measuring long-term efficacy of antiviral therapy in patients with CHB as it biases the data. Results generated using KM estimates should be interpreted with caution especially when the associated rates of relapse are not also analyzed. Although, CPT score did not significantly changed in total group, an important decrease was detected in patients without virological breakthrough. On the contrary virologic breakthrough was associated with a statistically significant increase in CPT scores (from 6.08\u03ee1.2 to 7.2\u03ee2.3, p\u03fd0.02). Also the frequency of complications of cirrhosis decreased with LMV treatment in comparison to pretreatment period. There was no significant difference in rate of complications between patients with and without virologic breakthrough. Thirteen patients (3 virologic breakthrough) developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mean 29\u03ee19 months (Cumulative HCC incidence 5.6%). Seven patients (2 virologic breakthrough) died within 41\u03ee21 months (5 HCC, 1 AML-M4, 1 hepatic encephalopathy and spontanoeus bacterial peritonitis). Three patients underwent liver transplantation. Conclusion: Long-term LMV therapy results in significant improvement in laboratory and clinical parameters of cirrhosis. Virologic breakthrough is not associated with clinical deterioration in compensated and mildly decompensated cirrhotics.",

In contrast, all FR significantly up-regulated TLR-2 at weeks 16 and 24. This increase was sustained to week 36, but by week 48 had returned to baseline. There was no change in TLR-4 expression in the FR group. The trend in TLR-2 protein expression was not seen at the mRNA level, reflecting the heterogenous PBMC population used for RT-PCR. Up to 12 weeks of therapy, the HBeAg titre declined in parallel with the viral load in FR but not SR. By week 12 the HBeAg titre of all FR was \u03fd300 PE IU/ml whilst in 6/8 SR it remained \u03fe300 PE IU/ml (P\u03fd0.05). In FR this represented a \u03fe90% reduction of mean HBeAg titre compared to \u03fd20% in SR (P\u03fd 0.05). No cases of HBeAg seroconversion were observed in either FR or SR. Discussion: We hypothesize that a critical level of TLR-2 expression is required for HBV clearance. Up-regulation of TLR-2 was seen in FR who achieved both a reduction of viral load to \u03fd 300 copies/ml and 90% reduction of HBeAg to \u03fd 300 PE IU/ml by 12 weeks of treatment. The reason for the decline in TLR2 expression after 36 weeks is unknown but may be consistent with the observed failure of HBeAg seroconversion. The effect of HBeAg on TLR-2 expression and antiviral escape provides a framework by which future treatments for CH-B may be optimized. Results: Of 144 patients who had a virologic response (\u03fd20,000 copies/ml) to peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy at the end of treatment, 89 had available data 48 weeks post-treatment. Of these patients, 49 (55%) sustained HBV DNA levels \u03fd100,000 cp/mL during the 48 week follow-up period [among these, 22 (25%) had HBV DNA levels between 20,000 and 100,000 copies/ml; and 27 (30%) had HBV DNA \u03fd20,000 cp/mL]. Patients with sustained virologic response had higher mean ALT levels at baseline (94.7 IU/L) compared with patients with relapse (77.6 IU/L). Mean baseline HBV DNA levels were 7.18 and 6.99 log for sustained responders and relapsers, respectively. HBV DNA level at the end of treatment was not different in patients with sustained response and those with relapse (2.5 and 2.6 log, respectively). The rate of sustained virologic response according to HBV genotype was 60% 3 \u20445, 43% 12 \u204428, 64% 27 \u204442 and 50% 5 \u204410 for genotypes A, B, C and D, respectively (P\u03ed0.08 for comparison of genotype B vs C). Conclusions: In patients with HBeAg-negative CHB, a finite 48week course of peginterferon alfa-2a was able to induce virologic response that was sustained 48 weeks post-treatment in more than half of the patients. There was no clear predictor of sustained response to peginterferon alfa-2a. However, there was a trend toward better response in patients with high ALT at baseline or who were infected with HBV genotype C. Baseline or end-oftreatment HBV DNA levels were not indicative of sustained virologic response. ",

Anyhow, there is still a lack of data about the efficacy of TDF against HBV in HIV/HBV coinfected patients. In our center we treated 37 HIV/HBV coinfected patients with TDF containing antiretroviral therapies since January 2002. 21 of those had a viral load of hepatitis B of more than 100000 IE/ml bevor the start of TDF. 10 of these patients had previously shown a clinically diagnosed resistance of HBV against Lamivudine (LAM). Methods: Retrospective analysis of the virological effectiveness of TDF against HBV in 21 HIV patients with highly replicative HBV coinfection, who were treated with a TDF containing antiretroviral therapy. Previous LAM resistance of HBV was defined as an increase of HBV of 2 log or more under treatment with LAM. Results: The 21 patients were all male and were in average 41 years old (range: 37-49). The average time on TDF was 27 month (range: 12-39) and the average viral load of HBV (VL) at baseline was 1.7x10log12 IE/ml (range: 2x10log5-1x10log13; N\u03ed21). At month 6 after start of treatment, the average VL was 743042 IE/ml(n\u03ed19), at month 12 it was 3769 IE/ml (n\u03ed17) and at month 24 the average VL was 230 IE/ml (n\u03ed15).

In the reported patients we did not see any viral break through of HBV of more than 1 log under therapy with TDF so fare. Conclusion: According to our experience TDF is a long-term effective drug against HBV in HIV/HBV coinfeted patients with or without HBV resistance against LAM.",

            "text": "Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype has been reported to correlate with response to interferon (IFN) treatment in several studies. The relationship between HBV genotype and thymosin\u24231 (T\u24231) treatment is unknown. We retrospectively examine HBV genotypes, precore and core promoter mutations in patients treated by T\u24231 and analyze the correlation between complete response (CR; ALT normalization plus seroclearance of HBeAg and HBV-DNA by solution hybridization) of T\u24231 therapy and HBV genotype. Patients and Methods: 98 patients with clinicopathologically proven chronic hepatitis B were randomized allocated to three groups: 1) T6 group (n\u03ed32) received a 26-week course of T\u24231 with a 1.6 mg subcutaneous injection two times a week; 2) T12 group (n\u03ed34) received the same regimen as T6 group, but T\u24231 therapy extended for 52 weeks; 3) T0 group (n\u03ed32) served as a control and was followed up for 18 months without specific treatment. Retrospectively analyze the HBV genotype, precore and core promoter mutation using stored serum and correlated with CR. Results: There were 90 stored serum available for HBV genotyping from patients completing the treatment and follow-up study (29 in T6 group; 31 in T12 group and 30 in T0 group). Of them, 49 (54%) were genotype B and 41 (46%) were genotype C. Genotype C had a higher frequency of core promoter mutation.Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that genotype (odds ratio [OR], 3.747; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.066-13.170; P\u03ed0.039), precore mutation (OR, 6.285; 95% CI, 1.874-21.086; P\u03ed0.003) and T\u2423-1 treatment (OR, 12.045; 95% CI, 2.220-65.354; P\u03ed0.004) as independent factors associated with CR. The CR of T\u2423-1 was higher in patients with genotype B compared to patients with genotype C (52% of genotype B vs 24% of genotype C; P\u03ed0.036) and in patients with precore mutation (14/22 or 64% in responder vs 6/31 or 19% in non-responder; P\u03ed0.002). Conclusion: Genotype, presence of precore mutation and T\u2423-1 therapy were independent predictors to CR. Genotype B, compared to genotype C, is associated with a higher response rate to T\u24231 therapy.",

            "text": "In this follow-up study, all patients who presented residual HBV replication by PCR between year 4 and 5 of treatment were studied for the presence of HBV polymerase resistance mutations on serum samples. The HBV-RT was sequenced and compared to the sequences obtained before ADV introduction. Among the 35 patients included in the initial cohort, 29 were still followed at year 4 and 14 had an undetectable viral load by PCR (\u03fd200 copies/mL). 15 had available samples with a viral load high enough to perform sequencing analysis. Median duration of add-on ADV of these 15 patients was 235 weeks and the median HBVDNA was 3.55 log10 cop./mL. 14/15 patients had constant fluctuating low viral loads between 2.3 (LLD) and 5 log10 cop./mL with no evidence of viral breakthrough. 10/15 patients had the same LAM-resistant pattern as their baseline sequence rtV173L/ L180M/M204V (n\u03ed2); rtL180M/M204V (n\u03ed8) and no noticeable change was observed in their RT sequences along time. 2/10 of them had ADV replaced by tenofovir (TDF) when the background HIV treatment required adjustment. 4/15 patients lost their LAM-R mutations. For 2 of them failure of compliance was documented. For the 2 remaining, analysis of their HIV and HBV viral load kinetics clearly suggested lack of compliance. 1/15 patient had a viral breakthrough with a HBVDNA rise over 1 log10 on two consecutive samples. At that time, LAM-R mutations rtV173L/ L180M/M204V were still present but no ADV mutation (rtA181V/T or rtN236T) or new conserved site mutations were identified; ADV was replaced by tenofovir and HBV DNA started to decline. Sequential monotherapy, after LAM-R breakthrough, could potentially increase the risk of subsequent HBV resistance selection. A strategy based on ADV add-on therapy seems very effective and is very unlikely to select for double ADV and LAM resistant variants, even in difficult to treat patients such those with HIV coinfection. The persistence of initially present LAM-R mutations, the low variability of the RT sequence and the absence of selection of further compensatory mutation indicate a strong pressure on a replication impaired virus. Results: 18 out of 55 (33%) were HBcAb\u03e9; 15 were HCV-RNA\u03e9 (27%) and 6 HBsAg\u03e9 (10%). HBsAg\u03e9 patients were treated with pre-emptive lamivudine therapy. Five (15%) HBcAb\u03e9 patients experienced HBV related hepatitis reactivation and they were found positive for c and s genes on liver tissue (occult B virus) but not on serum samples. These subjects were compared to a historical group of HBsAg\u03e9 patients (n.9) who also had a disease reactivation under the same circumstances (pre lamivudine era). In both groups lamivudine promptly dominated the pathological process and all the patients recovered. HBV-DNA titration on liver tisssue was significantly higher in HBsAG\u03e9 (10 4 -10 5 copies/ml) and occult B virus patients (10 3 -10 4 copies/ml)compared to HBcAB\u03e9 subjects in whom the occult virus was not identified (\u03fd10 3 copies/ml). Levels of serum HBV-DNA (RT-PCR) were not useful to discriminate between \"occult\" HBcAB\u03e9 and \"non-occult\" HBcAB\u03e9 patients. Conclusions: In NHL the prevalence of HBcAB\u03e9 is higher than HBsAG\u03e9 and occult infection plays a major role in HBV reactivation as well as overt HBV infection. However, its onset is not as frequent as in HBsAg\u03e9 patients. At the moment routinely used blood test to identify occult B virus does not exist. Lamivudine pre-emptive treatment should be also considered in HBcAb\u03e9 subjects undergone chemotherapy for NHL.",

We investigated the frequency of relapse after Peg-interferon alpha-2b therapy alone or in combination with lamivudine in chronic hepatitis B. A total of 266 chronic HBeAg-positive patients were treated with 100g Peg-IFN weekly for 52 weeks combined with lamivudine (n \u03ed 130) 100 mg/day or placebo (n \u03ed 136). After week 32 the Peg-IFN dose was reduced to 50g. The post-treatment follow-up lasted 26 weeks. At the end of treatment, HBeAg loss was seen in 44% in the combination group and 29% in the monotherapy group (p \u03ed 0.01). Overall, post-treatment HBeAg recurrence was seen in 27 patients (10%), but was strongly associated with treatment allocation. Twenty-two patients (17%) receiving the combination with lamivudine and 5 (4%: p \u03fd 0.0001) receiving Peg-IFN alone relapsed for HBeAg after treatment discontinuation. Except for treatment allocation, no other baseline variables could be identified as predictive factor for relapse.

In vitro data suggest that the N236T mutant exhibits only a 4.5 fold decrease in sensitivity to tenofovir. We therefore examined the efficacy of tenofovir in patients with adefovir resistance. We also explored the usefulness of tenofovir in patients with suboptimal response to adefovir, but without genotypic resistance. Methods: Two patients who were receiving adefovir because of lamivudine resistance developed resistance to adefovir, after 36 and 12 months of treatment respectively. The first case was receiving lamivudine \u03e9 adefovir and the second case adefovir monotherapy. The N236T mutation of the HBV-polymerase was demonstrated by the INNO-LiPA test (HBV DR v2, Innogenetics). They were treated with tenofovir 300mg id plus lamivudine 100mg id and adefovir was stopped. Four additional patients without genotypic resistance, but with sub-optimal response to adefovir were also switched to tenofovir 300mg id. They were also receiving adefovir \u03e9 lamivudine because of lamivudine resistance. These 4 cases had HBV-DNA viral loads of 97 x 10 6 , 42 x 10 6 , 14 x 10 6 and 3.6 x 10 6 millions copies/ml after 13, 23, 29 and 25 months of treatment with adefovir respectively. HBV-DNA viral loads were measured by the Bayer b-DNA assay (lower limit of detection \u03ed 2000 copies/ml). Results: The two patients with resistance to adefovir showed a good response to tenofovir. In the first case, serum HBV-DNA decreased from 93 x 10 6 copies/ml at baseline to 9,300 copies/ml after 6 months of treatment with tenofovir. In the second patient, serum HBV-DNA decreased from \u03fe 100 x 10 6 copies/ml at baseline to 23,000 copies/ml after 7 months of treatment. In the 4 patients with sub-optimal response to adefovir, tenofovir treatment produced a \u03fe 1 log drop in viral load after 1 month and a \u03fe 2 log drop after 3 months of therapy.

A study of 67 HBeAg-ve patients reported that ADV-resistant HBV mutants were detected in 0%, 3%, 11% and 18% after 1, 2, 3 and 4 years treatment, respectively. Aims: To characterize the virologic response to ADV, to determine the rate of ADV resistance, and to explore risk factors associated with suboptimal response and ADV resistance in patients referred to our Liver Clinic from 5/00 to 3/05. Methods: All patients who had received ADV for \u03fe 6 months and had virologic breakthrough (BT) or failed to achieve an initial virologic response (IVR) were tested for ADV resistance. LAM-and ADVresistant mutations were detected by a line probe assay (InnoLipa, DR2) and confirmed by direct sequencing. HBV DNA was quantified using the Roche Cobas Amplicor assay (LLOD 200 copies/ ml). BT was defined as \u03fe 1 log c/ml increase in HBV DNA after initial suppression; IVR was defined as serum HBV DNA \u03fd4 log c/ml after 6 months of ADV. The rate of ADV resistance was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: 39 CHB patients (36M, 26 Caucasians and 11 Asians, mean age 48 years, 26 HBeAg\u03e9ve) were included and mean duration of treatment was 20 months (range 7-57). 30 (77%) patients had prior LAM (mean duration 25 months) of whom 14 were switched to ADV monotherapy and 16 received combination of LAM\u03e9ADV; 9 (23%) were started on ADV as de novo therapy. 25 (64%) patients had LAM breakthrough or confirmed resistance. IVR was observed in only 44% patients. Factors associated with an IVR included lower HBV DNA (p\u03ed0.03) and the absence of HBeAg (p\u03ed0.02) at the onset of ADV treatment. 16 patients had BT or lack of IVR on ADV and 5 were found to have ADV-resistant mutations (3 rtA181V, 2 rtN236T). All 5 patients with ADV resistance had prior LAM therapy. At the time ADV resistance was detected, 4 had viral rebound \u03fe5 logs and ALT flares \u03fe2XULN. The rate of ADV resistance at months 6, 12, 18, and 24 was 0%, 0%, 9%, and 19%, respectively.

Conclusions: Half of our patients failed to achieve IVR on ADV. Lack of IVR was associated with high baseline HBV DNA and presence of HBeAg. The high rate of ADV resistance (19% at yr 2) in our clinic population may be related to referral bias and predominance of patients with LAM resistance. ADV resistance was associated with HBV genotype D and switch to ADV monotherapy. Combination therapy in patients with LAM resistance may prevent the development of ADV resistance. ",

The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and clinical consequence of ADV-resistant rtA181V/T and rtN236T mutation in lamivudine (LMV)-resistant CHB patients who were treated with ADV. Methods: A prospective randomized study was conducted, recruiting 73 consecutive HCC patients undergoing TAC using combined epirubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m 2 at monthly intervals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamivudine 100 mg daily before TAC (preemptive group) or not (control group). Hepatitis due to HBV reactivation was defined as a 3-fold or greater increase of serum ALT in patients with HBV reactivation (a 10-fold increase of viral load).

Resistance to ADV has been associated with three clusters of mutations, (i) D and A domains of the HBV polymerase (pol) which includes the mutation at rtN236T (ii) the B domain mutations at rtA181T/V and (iii) the C-D interdomain mutations rtV214A, rtQ215S which are distal to the active site. Resistance to TDF is associated with a mutation at rtA194T in the B-C interdomain region. The aim of this study was to determine the cross-resistance profiles of these mutations in vitro and analyse the molecular basis for resistance using molecular modelling. Methods: The ADV and TDF resistance HBV mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis in an HBV infectious clone. In vitro phenotypic analysis of the HBV clones was performed by transient transfection in the presence of ADV, or TDF or LMV using standard techniques and the IC50 determined from doseresponse curves using Table Curve 2D Results: In vitro antiviral testing of the C-D interdomain HBV mutants demonstrated a 4 to 10 fold increase in IC50 to ADV consistent with drug resistance and also a 10 fold increase in IC50 to LMV. HBV encoding the TDF resistance mutation at rtA194T showed a 7 fold increase in IC50. Molecular modelling of the two groups of B-C and C-D interdomain mutations revealed that these mutations are in loop regions at the opposite ends of the beta sheets that encompass the YMDD loop region. These two interdomain regions appear to be involved in structural integrity of the polymerase active site even though they are not located within the nucleotide binding pocket, nor directly interacting with the DNA. Mutations in these regions can result in conformational changes within the active site, affecting the cross-sensitivity profile to a number of antiviral agents including LMV. Conclusion: We have identified two distal regions in the HBV polymerase within the HBV polymerase that are associated with potential multidrug resistance to the class of acyclic phosphonate nucleoside analogues such as TDF and L-nucleoside analogues such as LMV. Molecular modelling in association with in vitro testing can aid in determining the significance of mutations in the context of chemical class resistance and thus may aid in the choice of the next therapeutic agent.",

Moreover, expression of PPAR\u2425 in vivo during liver injury appears to inhibit stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis. Here, we have hypothesized that depletion of PPAR\u2425 would exaggerate the fibrogenic response to liver injury in vivo. Methods: Wild type (WT) and PPAR\u2425 mutant mice (loxP sites were add to either side of exons 1 and 2 of the PPAR\u2425 gene) were subjected to bile-duct ligation or sham operation; adenovirus expressing cre-recombinase was injected through the portal vein. PPAR\u2425 was measured by immunoblot. Collagen I \u24231, TNF\u2423, and smooth muscle \u2423 \u2423actin expression were detected by realtime PCR and/or by immunohistochmistry of liver sections. Collagen content was assessed morphometrically and by hydroxyproline assay. The lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), was detected by immunohistochmistry. Results: Infection of PPAR\u2425 mutant mice with adenovirus expressing crerecombinase led to reduction in PPAR\u2425 expression, as expected. Bile duct ligation-induced elevations in aminotransferases were similar in WT and PPAR\u2425 deficient mice. Ten days after bile duct ligation, PPAR\u2425 deficient mice had histologic evidence of inflammatory cell infiltration and severe septal fibrosis. In contrast, WT mice had minor fibrotic lesions, mainly in peribiliary areas. Collagen accumulation, assessed histomorphometrically and by measuring hepatic hydroxyproline content, was markedly lower in WT mice compared to PPAR\u2425 depleted mice (1.28\u03ee0.14 versus 1.89\u03ee0.21, P\u03fd0.03). TGF\u2424 protein and TNF\u2423 mRNA levels were increased in PPAR\u2425 deficient mice compared to WT mice, as assessed by ELISA and Realtime PCR, respectively. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased smooth muscle \u2423-actin expression in PPAR\u2425 deficient mice. Finally, lipid peroxidation products were increased in PPAR\u2425 deficient mice compared to WT mice. Conclusions: PPAR\u2425 deficient mice exhibited enhanced oxidative injury, histological inflammation, and fibrosis after bile duct ligation induced liver injury.

However, it is not clear whether HGF has a direct inhibitory effect on collagen gene expression in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC). In the present study, we examined the effects of HGF on alpha 2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) transcription from the viewpoint of a signal cross talk between Smad3 and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). Methods: Effects of HGF and specific MAPK inhibitors on COL1A2 transcription were examined in an activated HSC clone transfected with COL1A2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs. MAPK phosphorylation and intracellular localization of Smad3 were analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence study, respectively. To study the inhibitory actions of HGF on COL1A2 promoter activation in vivo, we generated double transgenic mice harboring albumin promoter/HGF and COL1A2 promoter/luciferase fusion con-structs. Results: HGF counter-suppressed TGF-beta-stimulated COL1A2 transcription in activated HSC. This inhibitory action was mediated through the -313 to -185 COL1A2 promoter sequence, where a Smad-binding element also existed. HGF administration caused a rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and decreased the amount of Smad3 in the nuclei of activated HSC. Specific ERK1/2 signal inhibitors significantly increased COL1A2 transcription and enhanced nuclear localization of Smad3, whereas a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor markedly decreased gene transcription and suppressed intranuclear accumulation of Smad3. In the HGF-overexpressing transgenic mice, COL1A2 promoter activity, as well as endogenous COL1A2 mRNA levels, elevated following a single carbon tetrachloride injection was significantly suppressed as compared with the wild type littermates. Conclusion: COL1A2 transcription in activated HSC is under control of a reciprocal balance between ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signals. HGF directly suppresses COL1A2 transcription, and this inhibitory action is exerted, at least in part, through a signal cross talk between Smad3 and MAPK.",

Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are up-regulated in the cholestatic livers and believed to play a role of regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. MMP-13 is one of interstitial collagenases (ICs) and is a key enzyme for degrading fibrillar collagen. Recent studies have shown the function of ICs for reducing liver fibrosis. In these studies, genes coding ICs were administrated to fibrotic liver after the removal of fibrotic stimuli, resulting in the regression of liver fibrosis. However, the function of MMP-13 in the initial phase of liver fibrosis is still unclear. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MMP-13 during the development of cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis by using MMP-13-deficient mice. Methods: The wild-type (WT) and MMP-13-deficient mice were of a mixed 129/C57BL6 genetic background. Cholestasis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured on day 5 after BDL. Neutrophil accumulation in the liver was evaluated by chloroacetate esterase staining. Transcripts of MMP-13, inflammatory mediators, and fibrogenic markers in the 5-day BDL liver were quantified by TaqMan RT-PCR. Collagen accumulation in 3-week BDL liver were evaluated by Sirius Red staining and hydroxyproline content. Activation and proliferation of HSCs were detected by immunohisotochemistory using anti-alpha smooth muscle actin and anti-desmin antibody, respectively. Results: The expression of MMP-13 mRNA increased significantly in BDL liver of WT mice. Liver fibrosis was suppressed in MMP-13 deficient mice versus WT animals after BDL for 3 weeks. Activation and proliferation of HSCs were also suppressed in the liver of MMP-13 deficient mice after BDL. To clarify the mechanism of this suppression, samples from 5-day BDL mice were used for evaluating liver injury. Compared with WT animals, the levels of serum ALT and the number of hepatic neutrophils were reduced in MMP-13-deficient mice. The increase in mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly suppressed in the liver of MMP-13-deficient mice. Up-regulation of fibrogenic markers was also significantly suppressed in the liver of MMP-13-deficient mice versus WT mice. Conclusion: In distinct from the known function of ICs to reduce liver fibrosis via degrading ECM, the present study demonstrated that MMP-13 contributes to accelerating the fibrogenesis in the cholestatic livers by mediating the inflammation of the liver for ",

In addition, day 5 HSCs were incubated with LT-\u2424 (1ng/mL -316ng/mL), serum free, for 1-24 hrs. Whole cell protein was subjected to Western blot. RNA was subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) using SYBR green technology. LT-\u2424R knockout (KO) and wild-type C57BL/6 mice (WT) were fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for up to 14 days to induce liver damage, before livers were subjected to immunohistochemistry for \u2423SMA expression. Results: qPCR and Western analysis of HSC activation demonstrated that LT-\u2424R was highly expressed in day 1 HSC and expression remained constant up to day 6. Day 5 HSCs incubated with LT-\u2424 for 3 hrs demonstrated significantly increased gene expression of ICAM1 and IB\u2423 (up to 12-and 8-fold vs controls, resp.), however no changes in \u2423SMA or Collagen \u24231 (I) gene expression were observed. Following 7 days on the CDE diet (mild damage) the median \u2423SMA immunohistological grading for both WT and LT-\u2424R KO mice was 1\u03e9. On day 14 of the diet (peak damage) the median \u2423SMA grade for WT mice was 3\u03e9 (Fig 1A) where as LT-\u2424R KO demonstrated significantly reduced \u2423SMA expression with a grade of 1\u03e9 (Fig 1 B) .",

We have developed an animal model of fibrosing steatohepatitis elicited by the transgenic protein without any complications. It was based on the conditional transgenic mouse in which expression of HCV core protein is regulated by the tetracycline-off system and liver-specific promoter. Matings were carried out with mice on doxycycline (dox)-containing chow, which fully suppresses core expression. HCV core protein was detectable in the liver of all lines but with variable expressing levels. Microvesicular steatosis was present and highly associated with core expression. Inflammation was minimal in the lines with extremely high and low expressing levels. In the lines with moderate core expression, however, marked inflammation and perisinusoidal deposition of extracellular matrix were detected accompanied by the activation of hepatic stellate cells as shown by staining fibronectin, collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) in the liver. Furthermore, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta level in the liver correlated with both the core densities and inflammation degree. CD8 lymphocytes had been proved to be the predominant infiltrating inflammatory cells. By means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining and caspase bioassay, the apoptotic rates of the liver were found to increase significantly higher than that in the non-transgenic littermates. Oxidative stress evaluated by labeling the liver in situ with 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and thioredoxin were also significantly higher and most positive stained-hepatocytes were nearby the inflammatory areas. It was found that the number of hepatocytes positive for HCV core decreased progressively over 2-8 months, so did the inflammation and fibrosis. Anyhow, by applying a cyclic induction-deinduction protocol of (dox)-containing chow administration, liver fibrosis re-occurred within a few cycles and progressed further when cyclic induction was continued. Conclusions: We have developed mice that are conditionally transgenic for HCV core protein. In addition to hepatic steatosis, the lines with moderate transgene expression revealed significant hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, which associated with predominant CD8 infiltration, marked apoptosis and oxidative stress elicited by the core protein. The diminution of both core protein and inflammation as time passing by could be reverted by applying the cyclic induction-deinduction of HCV core expression.",

Montgomery Bissell Liver fibrosis is causally related to the activation of fibrogenic cells into myofibroblasts. This process is regulated by many biological molecules. Thrombin is the key enzyme of blood coagulation since it converts fibrinogen into fibrin. In addition, thrombin signalling via protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 is profibrogenic in cultured myofibroblasts, whereas in vivo antagonism of thrombin or of PAR-1 is protective against liver fibrosis. Activated Protein C (APC) is generated from inactive Protein C (PC) when bound to the Endothelial Protein C receptor (EPCR) in the presence of thrombin bound to thrombomodulin. APC is the physiologic inhibitor of thrombin generation and could thus be considered as anti-fibrogenic agent. However, its overall effect can not be predicted since EPCR-bound APC also signalizes via PAR-1. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of APC on fibrogenic events in human liver myofibroblasts. Immunohistochemistry performed on fibrotic liver tissue showed that EPCR mainly localized to endothelial cells, as expected. However, a fraction of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts also expressed EPCR. EPCR expression was confirmed on cultured human liver myofibroblasts by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Myofibroblasts also express PAR-1 and thus provide an adequate interface for APC signalling. The EPCR-PAR-1 complex was functional as evidenced by increased MAPK p42/p44 phosphorylation in response to APC; the effect of APC was maximal after 10 minutes of treatment and for a 100 nM concentration, reaching 311.3 \u03ee 47.2% of control values (p \u03fd 0.001). This was similar to the induction by 18 nM thrombin (406.1 \u03ee 88.1%). In contrast PC had no effect (106.2 \u03ee 17.8%) and induction by APC was not significantly modified by the addition of hirudin, a specific thrombin antagonist (269.8 \u03ee 40.1% stimulation vs 301.3 \u03ee 48.8%). Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1) is a major actor of liver fibrogenesis as it inhibits extracellular matrix degradation. TIMP-1 is secreted by myofibroblasts, and up-regulated during liver fibrosis. We show that APC increased TIMP-1 secretion in conditioned medium by 2.4 \u03ee 0.4 fold (p \u03ed 0.04), similarly to thrombin (2.3 \u03ee 0.4 fold, p \u03ed 0.05). Finally, using flow cytometry, we demonstrate that myofibroblasts also express membrane thrombomodulin and are able to generate low levels of APC from PC in the presence of thrombin. These data show that liver myofibroblasts are able to generate APC, and that APC has profibrogenic effects in cultured myofibroblasts. Ongoing work will indicate the precise in vivo function of APC in liver fibrogenesis.",

            "text": "Background and Aim: In all types of liver injury, there is a complex balance between hepatocyte cell death, regenerative and fibrogenic responses. Activation of the IGF-1R signaling pathway contributes to the proliferation of hepatocytes during posthepatectomy liver regeneration. The aim of this study was to examine the role of IGF signaling on other aspects of liver tissue repair, i.e. hepatocyte cell death and fibrogenesis, using a conditional knockout mouse in which IGF-1R is deleted in hepatocytes. Methods: To specifically invalidate the IGF-1R in hepatocytes, mice homozygously floxed on IGF-1R alleles were bred with mice that expressed the Cre recombinase under the control of albumin promoter and \u2423-fetoprotein enhancer (LIGFREKO mice). LIG-FREKO mice and control littermates underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) and were investigated 3 days later. Serum concentrations of transaminases (ALAT/ASAT) and of bile acids were measured. Histological analysis was performed on paraffine embedded, hematoxykin-eosin-stained liver sections and hepatocyte necrotic areas was measured by morphometric analysis. mRNA expression of \u2423-smooth muscle actine (\u2423-SMA), collagen I and TGF-\u24241 was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using Light Cycler technique. Results: No difference in ALAT/ASAT nor in bile acid concentrations was found in comparing LIGFREKO mice with controls. However, the LIGFREKO mice exhibited significantly less extensive parenchymal bile infarct and hepatocyte necrosis as compared to control mice. The expression of \u2423-SMA, collagen I and TGF\u24241 were also reduced by 40-50% in 3 days-BDL LIGFREKO compared with control mice. Conclusion: Our results show that the invalidation of IGF-1R in hepatocytes attenuates hepatic injury and the fibrogenic response induced by biliary obstruction.",

The relationship between the expression of eNOS and fibrogenesis in the liver remains unclear. This study aimed to establish a possible pathway by which L-Arginine attenuates chronic liver fibrosis presumably via eNOS expression. Male ICR mice administered carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 8 weeks together with 5-methylisothiourea hemisulfate (SMT), an iNOS inhibitor, or L-Arginine, a NOS substrate were used to study the effect of NO inhibition and increased substrate provision on liver fibrosis. Blood and liver tissue were analyzed. RT-PCR, Western Blotting, EMSA, serum ALT and total 8-isoprostane measurements were performed. Sirius Red staining for fibrosis was quantified using image analysis. CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress were shown by high levels of serum ALT, serum total 8-isoprostane and nitrotyrosine. Extensive accumulation of collagen in the liver tissue was confirmed by Sirius Red staining. The mRNA and protein levels of iNOS in the liver after CCl4 treatment were increased (p \u03fd 0.01) but eNOS was decreased (p \u03fd 0.05). Both SMT and L-Arginine effectively reduced CCl4 induced oxidative stress but L-Arginine showed a greater suppression of collagen formation (p \u03fd 0.001; TGF-B1, procollagen-I and Sirius Red staining) and of iNOS expression. Administration of L-Arginine restored the level of eNOS. NF-kB which regulates iNOS was upregulated (p \u03fd 0.05) in CCl4 treated mice. AP-1 which regulates eNOS was, in contrast, downregulated (p \u03fd 0.01) and both effects were reversed after treatment with L-Arginine. Our results showed that the administration of L-Arginine was more effective than SMT in the suppression of liver fibrosis although both drugs reduced the level of oxidative stress to the same extent. It is possible that L-Arginine, by improving production of NO, facilitates hepatic blood flow and thus retards the progression of liver fibrosis. This is supported by our observation that reduced eNOS expression in CCl4-treated mice was reversed by L-Arginine. Furthermore, L-Arginine also reversed the downregulation of AP-1, an eNOS promoter.",
