One of a number of challenges this strategy faces is that contact tracing is extremely labor intensive. Deployed in sexuallytransmitted infections such as HIV, a recent study from New York reported costs of over $500 per contact interviewed with 85% of state-level costs attributable to personnel [1] . For Coronavirus these efforts are simpler but the volume of contacts-an average of 36 per positive case [2] pose substantial logistic challenges. Digital applications and other technological supports may help, though it appears inevitable that a large labor force will be needed. Already, Massachusetts has begun hiring to fill their state's projected need for 1,000 contact tracing workers [3] . Health Canada has an open call for a volunteer workforce to do contact tracing and other related tasks [4] . South Korea employed a massive workforce of public health workers at the peak of the epidemic [5] .",

Using this model, we can take this opportunity to scale-up testing for infectious diseases as well as noncommunicable diseases and by doing so improve community health.

We excluded contact tracing because of the relatively limited experimental evidence supporting its effectiveness in HIV and the uncertainty regarding the potential scale this type of effort could actually reach.
