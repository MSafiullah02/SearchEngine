However, current approaches are highly selective, restricted to medical care, and methodologically imprecise (Ozegowski and Sundmacher 2012; SVR Gesundheit 2014). Underlying theoretical assumptions usually refer to the normative dimension within the concept of (healthcare) needs. It represents an objectively (by experts, professionals, and scientists) justified need for a certain intervention due to a certain condition (e.g., Bradshaw 1972; Daniels 1981). This approach is criticized by some authors, as it forces unidirectional needs assessment by professional judgements (e.g., Bradshaw 1972; Godfrey and Callaghan 2000) and neglects subjective (felt) needs dimensions that also determine service demand and utilization (Bradshaw 1972) based on experience, expectations, knowledge, or preferences (Godfrey and Callaghan 2000). As a result, current approaches may reinforce a silo mentality and negate the multidimensionality of healthcare needs. This is particularly challenging with vulnerable patient populations, which often feature particular needs for continuing complex healthcare in differing settings and from varying professions (e.g., WHO 2015).",

However, these patients in Germany are typically cared for in settings not prepared or suitable for these requirements, such as private homes, shared apartments, or, infrequently, nursing homes. Meanwhile, increasing political attention and research activities reveal issues concerning inappropriateness, fragmentation, and regional variation of specialized services, market-driven service development, inadequate professional qualification, and poor outcomes of specialized healthcare (Lehmann et al. 2016; Stark et al. 2016).",

This was achieved using the interventional indicator of \u201clong-term invasive ventilation\u201d (identifier). Consequently, according to the current German guideline (DGP 2017) and recommendations on home invasive ventilation (Randerath et al. 2011), the patient group in need was defined as adult patients with continuing dependency on invasive ventilation due to chronic respiratory insufficiency. Continuing dependency exists if the individual requires intermittent or continuous invasive ventilator support (\u201cunsuccessful weaning\u201d; Sch\u00f6nhofer et al. 2014) in the private home, shared apartments, or nursing home settings. The particular vulnerability of these patients results from a significant severity of underlying diseases with dependency on continuing specialized care due to the likelihood of life-threatening incidents and the loss of self-governance (Randerath et al. 2011). Consequently, patients are usually entitled to specialized nursing care services in community settings (home or shared apartment) or nursing homes according to \u00a737(2) German Code of Social Law V (Sozialgesetzbuch V, SGB V). Patients not meeting this vulnerability criterion were excluded. This also applies to children and adolescents due to significantly differing morbidity (DGP 2017).",

Supplementary basic characteristics (type of assessment and inventory, spatial reference, periodicity, availability, access) of eligible data sources were reported.

However, and despite these inherent advantages, insurance data feature three considerable access disadvantages. (1) Claims data are not publicly available. Any analysis requires previous application requests regarding access and processing conditions. (2) They exclusively represent the population of a given insurance with the risk of associated methodological challenges and bias (Schubert et al. 2014; Swart et al. 2015). An existing cross-insurance metadata pool, according to \u00a7303d SGB V (information system healthcare data [Informationssystem Versorgungsdaten]) (DIMDI 2014), does not currently contain information that enables the identification of LTIV patients. Therefore, assessing the healthcare needs of the specific patient group on a broader than single insurer level would entail considerable effort and resources. (3) In addition to the general validity problems of insurance data (Schubert et al. 2014), the potential and reliability of analyses on the specific patient group are questionable overall. Individual data requests for available information on LTIV from single insurers showed a substantial informational variability: whether the ventilation mode (noninvasive/invasive), condition, place of residence, and (comprehensive) healthcare utilization of LTIV patients is known depends on coding principles that vary between insurers (Stark et al. 2016).",

Rather, such approaches should incorporate a cross-sectoral perspective that addresses the multisectoral and interprofessional healthcare needs of LTIV patients. Thus, it is recommended to develop and harmonize specific indicators related to LTIV that enable the identification, characterization (e.g., morbidity, demographics), and classification (e.g., stratified by severity, vulnerability) of the patient group and their differing healthcare needs. This basic information should be supplemented by cross-sectoral data on medical, therapeutic, and nursing health interventions utilization and the provision of medical supplies.

Thus, future research should answer fundamental questions based on the knowledge required about the healthcare needs of LTIV patients, but also comparable patient groups. It should be made clear how appropriate healthcare in the right place at the right time should be shaped. Additionally, current anecdotal evidence on unmet needs in terms of access, appropriateness, continuity, and quality of healthcare should be evaluated for its impact on outcomes and patient safety, as well as at the systems level. For their part, these findings should guide the planning, regulation, and provision of needs-based healthcare for LTIV patients.",

Only the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics provide hospital-specific data as of 2017, enabling OPS-based identification and description of the initial setup or control of cases of LTIV at home. Thus, valid information on the current and prospective patient population and their need for specific healthcare is currently lacking. These results imply that future improvements of the date availability and differentiation have to be undertaken to provide the basis for evidence-based approaches to needs-oriented specialized healthcare. Eligible approaches to needs assessment should consider the very heterogeneity, severity, and complexity of the healthcare needs of the patient group, including subjective dimensions on a life course perspective, as well as quantitative and qualitative service performance characteristics across multiple sectors and professions.",
