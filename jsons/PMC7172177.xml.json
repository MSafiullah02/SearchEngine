            "text": "Bats (Chiroptera) are classified into suborders that separate frugivorous from insectivorous and hematophagous bats (with some overlap in the two groups, reviewed in Jones and Teeling, 2006). Species from both groups are implicated as reservoirs for a diverse spectrum of zoonotic pathogens (reviewed in Calisher et al., 2006). Wide distribution and genetic diversity of some of the viruses including lyssaviruses (Arguin et al., 2002, Badrane and Tordo, 2001, Messenger et al., 2002, Van der Poel et al., 2005) and coronaviruses (Chu et al., 2006, Li et al., 2005) suggest a long history of endemic presence in bat populations. For Nipah and Hendra viruses bats appear to function as both reservoir and vector (Chua et al., 2002, Halpin et al., 2000, Hayman et al., 2008, Reynes et al., 2005, Yob et al., 2001). Bats are furthermore investigated as reservoir to filoviruses as animals positive for RNA sequences from or antibodies against filoviruses have been found in regions where outbreak of Marburg or Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been recorded (Leroy et al., 2005, Swanepoel et al., 2007, Towner et al., 2007). However, live filoviruses have not yet been isolated from wild bats, possibly because bats are not a primary reservoir, or because the window of active shedding of filoviruses is brief and may require activation by physiological stimuli such as endocrine responses to stress (Strong et al., 2008).",

Fluctuations in body temperature and metabolic rates to conserve energy for self-powered flight may help viruses to establish subclinical persistence. Self-powered flight also allows for wide dissemination of pathogens. Finally, bats comprise a very old order of the mammalia class, branching into the various bat species 89 million years ago in the late Cretaceous period (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007). Their innate and adaptive immune system may react to certain pathogens very differently compared to the immune system of most extant mammalia, and some zoonotic agents may have decreased pathogenicity towards bats due to co-evolution with the flying mammals as reservoir (Badrane and Tordo, 2001).",

A total of five pregnant animals were identified by palpation and deeply anaesthesized with isofluran. The uteri were surgically removed and the animals were euthanized by debleeding. The uteri were approximately 2 cm in diameter; they were placed into PBS immediately after removal for transport at ambient temperature to the cell culture laboratory. Six hours after sample removal, the fetuses were excised from the uteri. Amniotic fluid, cells from brain, liver, and the vertebrate column were carefully aspirated under sterile conditions with 18G syringes and transferred (separately, not as pool) into culture medium. Body segments without further attempt at obtaining specific tissues were briefly treated with TrypLE (Gibco) prior to tituration into culture medium. Culture medium is DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% gamma-irradiated fetal calf serum (Biochrom AG); only for the initial five passages the medium was also supplemented with antibiotic and antimycotic (Gibco/Invitrogen), long-EGF (SAFC) to 20 ng/ml and long-R3IGF-I (SAFC) to 10 ng/ml. Cells from a total of 14 preparations were seeded into 6-well culture plates and transfected using effectene (Qiagen) within 7\u20139 days after plating.

Transfection efficiency was satisfactory (see parallel GFP control in Fig. 1A) and first foci of clonal cells with less pleomorphic appearance than primary cells were visible within 2 weeks of transfection. Primary cells died from senescence with repeated passaging of the cultures. Senescence describes a cellular state with decreased proliferation rates until complete stasis or cell death due to telomere erosion of the chromosomes and accumulation of signal proteins important in cell cycle control. Senescent cells usually are large and pleomorphic with striated cytoplasm of low phase contrast. Fig. 1A shows three of the final cell lines after 40 weeks (low passage) and after 80 weeks (high passage cell lines) of continuous culture. Surprisingly, even after 35 weeks of continuous culture morphologies of the immortalized cells at subconfluency highly resemble morphology of the source culture (cell lines R05T was derived from the head of the fetus from animal #15, R06E from the body of the fetus from animal #12 and R05R from the vertebrate column of the fetus from animal #12). Doubling time of R06E and R05T is approximately 50 h, of R05R approximately 6 days. Because proliferation of the R05R cells is so slow most experiments described here were performed with R06E and R05T.",

As controls, HEK 293 cells (a human cell line known to be highly permissive for adenovirus) and duck CR cells (not permissive for adenovirus) were infected in parallel. Common to all cell lines examined here is expression of human adenovirus serotype 5 E1-region so that the E1-deleted vector is trans-complemented in all hosts.

However, if infected Rousettus cells within four passages are co-cultivated with HEK 293 cells the sentinel cells become infected, amplify AdGFP and allow fulminant infection (Fig. 2B). For this experiment, R06E cells were infected with AdGFP and passaged at least three times to remove any lingering input virus. After the third and fourth passage the infected R06E cells were mixed with an equal number of HEK 293 cells. The two cell lines can be differentiated by size and morphology: HEK 293 are smaller than R06E, more compact with more distinctive phase contrast and better discernible nuclei.",

For example, active henipaviruses have been isolated from wild fruit bats with low efficiencies (Chua et al., 2002, Reynes et al., 2005) confirming that transmission may also depend on intricate host-virus processes (Halpin et al., 2000, Middleton et al., 2007). Regarding properties of the viral strain, most lyssavirus genotypes are considered to be highly pathogenic (Badrane et al., 2001). Live virus has been isolated from sick rabid bats (Field et al., 1999, Johnson et al., 2003) but asymptomatic endemic persistence of a wild lyssavirus strain related to genotype 1 has also been detected (in Serengeti spotted hyenas, East et al., 2001).",

However, E1A also interferes with other transcriptional co-activators and by doing so induces apoptosis via several pathways (Frisch and Mymryk, 2002, Putzer et al., 2000). The adenoviral E1B gene encodes two open reading frames on a bicistronic mRNA, the 21K and 55K proteins, that protect the cells against apoptosis induced by E1A (Putzer et al., 2000, Yew et al., 1994).",

During the process a number of mutations and deletions in the viral genome accumulated resulting in severe host restriction (Meyer et al., 1991). MVA is a highly promising tool for therapeutic and protective vaccine applications (Sutter and Moss, 1992, Weyer et al., 2007): it can be made to express recombinant vaccine antigens in cells not permissive for a full infectious cycle and combines highest level of safety even for immunocompromized human patients with induction of a robust and broad immune response in the organism. Among mammalian cells only the BHK-21 line (from Syrian hamster kidney) has been shown to be fully permissive for MVA (Carroll and Moss, 1997, Drexler et al., 1998). In the R06E line MVA replicates to levels beyond 108\n pfu/ml (Fig. 3) that rival avian cells, exceeding the published and our parallel values in the range of 106\n pfu/ml for replication in BHK (Drexler et al., 1998). The R05T cell line is less efficient than R06E but with 3.3 \u00d7 107\n pfu/ml in the expected range for a fully permissive host cell.

In all of these cell lines strong E1 expression is maintained without selection, in the venerable HEK 293 cell line in many laboratories since 1977, in the avian CR cell lines for more than 260 passages that include several cloning steps and adaptation to proliferation in suspension in chemically defined medium. In the Rousettus cell lines E1A and E1B expression is extremely weak especially in R06E. Transfection with expression plasmids for the GFP reporter gene under control of the same promoters used to drive E1A and E1B expression yields low GFP signal intensity in Rousettus cells but not in the avian reference cells. E1 expression close to the detection limit in the R06E cell line possibly was insufficient for a complete immortalization explaining a long lag phase for 30 weeks, during which a subpopulation of R06E evolved into a different lineage with very short doubling times. Serendipitously weak expression of E1A in all Rousettus cell lines may explain the low level of differentiation into epithelial phenotype that is expected in an E1A-positive cell line (Frisch, 1994). Sudden proliferation after a long lag phase in R06E (Fig. 1B) is fully compatible with the model that immortalization occurs in consecutive steps (Hahn and Weinberg, 2002, Ye et al., 2008). If the biochemical pathways for cell cycle progression are not clearly defined the cell population will eventually shunt into alternative routes. Even for stem cell lines with potential for unlimited proliferation culture conditions exert selective pressure such as overexpression of NANOG to relieve dependence on feeder layers (Darr et al., 2006). In R05T E1 expression is stronger and this cell line displayed only a short lag phase (probably adaptation of the nascent cell line to culture conditions ex vivo) after which proliferation rates remain stable also at high passages. R06E is an impressive example for the kinetic with which E1 expression is lost if it is not required by a cell line.",

The importance of the interferon response feeding into recognition of viral RNA as a pathogen-associated pattern has recently been demonstrated in persistent infection of Ebola virus (Strong et al., 2008). It is possible that the anti-antiviral effects of E1A in the Rousettus cell lines lower the defenses of the producer cell for MVA leading to faster replication. We should be careful in extrapolating from replication of MVA in Rousettus cell lines to other systems. However, in the light of the results by Strong et al. (2008) we speculate that an E1A-positive R05T cell line would be preferred over the late-passage R06E for pathogen isolation as the R05T cell line may be less prone to cryptic infection. To examine field samples for pathogens it may also be helpful to add low levels of mitogens such as phorbol esters to obtain higher levels of virus or better detectable CPE.",

Low levels of gene expression may affect virus replication or expression of genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity. The Rousettus cell lines appear not to be notably resistant to viruses: they are partially permissive for a human adenovirus vector and fully permissive for MVA, a highly attenuated virus that does not replicate in most mammalian cells. Permissivity for such a selective virus suggests that the Rousettus cell lines may allow isolation of pathogens where suitable host cells have previously not been available. Also, if MVA can be shown to replicate and spread in bats without causing significant disease this virus has the potential to provide a vaccine vector that should remain confined to the treated colonies and yet induces herd immunity.",
