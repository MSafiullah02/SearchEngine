As with most infectious syndromes outlined in this text, the increased risk of respiratory tract disease encountered in transplant recipients relates in part to defects in innate and adaptive immunity. Within this population, however, the incidence and microbiological etiology of respiratory infections are quite variable. This is due in part to the use of heterogeneous immunosuppressive regimens and differing prophylactic antibiotic strategies. In addition to diminished host immunity, anatomic breaches in upper and lower respiratory tract defenses may increase the susceptibility of immunocompromised hosts to a variety of common and opportunistic pathogens. Such anatomical considerations are especially important in patients who have undergone thoracic surgery for lung and heart transplantation and individuals who have required prolonged mechanical ventilation. Medical devices such as nasogastric and endotracheal tubes hinder coordinated glottic movement and mucociliary function and act as conduits for the introduction of pathogenic organisms to the respiratory tract [2].",

In most cases, cultures of nasal discharge are not helpful; a nasal wash for bacterial cultures and a PCR panel that assesses a number of common and uncommon respiratory viruses may considerably improve diagnostic yeild. When imaging is obtained, fluid levels are found in 86% of cases [6]. Although a wide variety of organisms can cause acute sinusitis, the vast majority of infections are due to viral pathogens. These include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and even CMV [14\u201316]. Viral infections\ncan be short-lived but viral shedding can be prolonged among immunocompromised patients. Bacterial sinus infections\nare much less common and rarely occur with less than 7 days of symptoms [17]. Common bacterial causes of acute bacterial sinusitis include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. aureus, and anaerobes. Pseudomonas can be a prominent sinus pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients both before and after lung transplantation [18, 19]. While most cases of acute bacterial sinusitis are caused by one predominant organism, up to one quarter have two distinct pathogens present in high concentration [20]. It is important to note, however, that in routine clinical practice, the majority of patients with acute sinusitis do not have a bacterial pathogen isolated.",

Complications of acute sinusitis include facial cellulitis, preseptal periorbital cellulitis, brain abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and orbital invasion that may result in sight and life threatening orbital (post-septal) cellulitis [21]. Intracraneal extension should be suspected if mental status changes occur or if there are focal neurological signs [22]. CT imaging or MRI scan should be urgently obtained, and otolaryngology evaluation with endoscopy should be sought for both diagnosis (cultures and histology) and therapeutic drainage.

As opposed to pneumonia, the lower airways are not involved, and chest imaging is generally normal. Patients typically present with a cough lasting more than 5 days, an important factor distinguishing it from mild upper respiratory infection (URI) [36]. Symptoms usually persist for 10\u201320 days but may extend for more than 4 weeks. Most patients report purulent sputum, indicating sloughing of tracheobronchial epithelium and inflammation. As opposed to bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis\ndoes not usually present with progressive cough, wheezing, tachypnea, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, entails continuing symptoms on most days of the month for at least 3 months of the year during two consecutive years.",

Despite similar epidemiology, immunocompromised patients often suffer from prolonged periods viral shedding and progress to pneumonia more frequently [50]. Higher rates of airflow obstruction and increased mortality are also key differences [50, 51]. Respiratory viral infections immediately prior to bone marrow transplant are associated with decreased survival [52]. Among lung transplant recipients, respiratory viral infection, particularly RSV, can be associated with progression of chronic rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) on histopathologic examination [41, 47, 48, 53]. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopietic stem cell transplantation similarly are at risk for BOS that potentially may have been triggered after an episode of respiratory viral infection [54].",

These opportunistic pathogens are most frequently associated with chronic, indolent pneumonias. In the United States, the rapidly growing mycobacteria particularly M. abscessus and M. fortuitum have emerged as another important, albeit less frequent cause of NTM lung disease. The diagnosis of pulmonary NTM infections remains a challenge as identification of these organisms in respiratory cultures may result from colonization of the respiratory tract or environmental contamination. Causality is suggested by identification of NTM\nin sterile lower respiratory tract specimens coupled with corresponding clinical manifestations such as chronic nonproductive cough and exertional dyspnea and a NTM lung disease compatible radiographic presentation. Fever, night sweats, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural effusions are also possible but less frequent in the absence of systemic disseminated infection.",

Similarly, a marked increase in pulmonary invasive fungal infections due to non-Aspergillus molds including Fusarium, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Scedosporium spp. and the dematiaceous (black) molds has also been noted, making the selection of an effective empiric regimen more challenging. The increased incidence of pulmonary mucormycosis may be related to changes in antifungal utilization with a shift away from amphotericin B compounds in favor of mold-active triazole drugs like voriconazole [102]. The effects of newer triazole agents like posaconazole and isavuconazonium on the overall feasibility, efficacy and safety in magagement of fungal pneumonia in transplant recipients is evolving and appears encouraging.

Despite this, in most cases of pulmonary mycosis, the only radiographic findings at the time of presentation are peripheral, pleural-based lung nodules, sometimes with thick-walled regular or irregular cavities [103]. The definitive diagnosis of pulmonary invasive fungal infection requires demonstration of fungal hyphae within the involved lung tissue. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis is often made by inference as high prevalence of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies in transplant recipients render lung biopsies unsafe. It is important to note that isolation of fungi in respiratory samples may misrepresent the etiology of underlying pulmonary infiltrates as they may reflect environmental contamination or respiratory tract colonization.",

The spectrum of hMPV disease may range from mild upper respiratory tract infection to serious disseminated infection leading to respiratory failure and encephalitis.

As invasive CMV disease often affects the transplanted allograft, lung transplant recipients are at particularly high risk of CMV pneumonitis [104].

In patients with extensive lung involvement, dyspnea may appear early in the course of infection. Viral nucleic acids in nasal washes, tracheal aspirates, and bronchial specimens are most frequently used in diagnosing viral respiratory infections through multiplex PCR platforms. Despite that, the isolation of CMV especially by PCR amplification from lower respiratory tract secretions may not necessarily indicate CMV lung infection as even in transplant recipients with severe cellular immune defects; intermittent low-level viral replication and shed virus without developing viral lung disease has been well established. Hosts\u2019 risk assessment and CMV disease susceptibility evaluation along with radiographic imaging such as non-iv-contrast chest CT scan prove helpful in discerning active viral lung disease versus non-disease associated CMV respiratory tract viral shedding. Of note, chest CT scans may show ground glass opacities even when conventional chest radiographs are unremarkable, improving the sensitivity of diagnosis. Ganciclovir or foscarnet are commonly prescribed for systemic CMV infections. In transplant recipients with CMV pneumonitis, IVIG immune modulation along with effective antiviral drug if recommended.
