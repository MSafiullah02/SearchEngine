One critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person-to-person or environment-to-person is its ability to survive on environmental surfaces. Survival studies have been carried out on both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Mbithi et al20 evaluated the viability of hepatitis A virus (HAV) on human hands and were able to recover 16% to 30% of the applied virus from hands after 1 hour of drying. In another study, survival of nonenveloped enteric viruses was found to vary according to the surface tested.21 Of the viruses tested, HAV and rotaviruses were more stable than polio-1 and adenoviruses on paper, cotton cloth, aluminium, china, glazed tiles, and latex gloves.",

However, the rate of 90% virus reduction was different on these 2 fomites. The level of FCV declined faster on receivers (4-8 hours) than on buttons (12-24 hours), indicating that the nature of the surface will have an impact on the survival of the virus. These results are in agreement with those of Abad et al,21 who found that survivability of HAV, rotavirus, poliovirus, and adenoviruses was variable on various porous and nonporous surfaces. The results of this and past studies indicate that both nonenveloped and enveloped viruses can survive on environmental fomites for a few hours to days,20, 21, 22 which may be sufficient time for the virus to be acquired by a susceptible individual. These results emphasize the need to evaluate effective means to disinfect such surfaces in case of possible contamination in addition to following standard hygienic practices such as frequent handwashing.",
