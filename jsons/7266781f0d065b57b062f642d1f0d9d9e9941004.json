            "text": "Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a recently recognized category of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies manifesting as symmetric proximal limb muscle weakness and high serum creatine kinase (CK) level, along with specific histopathological findings. IMNM is divided into 3 groups: anti-signal-recognition particle (anti-SRP); anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR); and autoantibody-negative IMNM. 1 Thus far, most reported patients with IMNM have been adults. 2 Some pediatric patients were identified in 3 previous studies with limited information. [4] [5] [6] Rouster-Stevens and Pachman described 3 juvenile polymyositis patients with anti-SRP antibody. 7 Suzuki et al. reported 2 Japanese girls with anti-SRP myopathy. 8 Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies were detected in a total of 13 children with inflammatory myopathy in 2017. 9, 10 We describe a boy with a diagnosis of antibody-negative IMNM who improved after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).",

He lost 3 pounds, without changes in bowel or bladder habits or control, and had no diurnal variation in his weakness. His family denied any trauma, preceding febrile illness, rash, numbness, dysphagia, ptosis, diplopia, or dysarthria. The family also denied use of herbal medicines, or other toxic exposures.

There were approximately 5 necrotic myofibers per low-power (100\u00d7 magnification) field, which is considered to be a moderate degree of active myofiber necrosis, and at least twice that number of regenerating myofibers, all with a random distribution throughout the sample. Moderate nonspecific myofiber atrophy, some attributable to the regenerating myofibers, was present. There was no perifascicular patterning of the atrophy, necrosis, or regeneration, as would be characteristic of dermatomyositis. There were only a few isolated perimysial foci of scant lymphocytic inflammation. Features of polymyositis, such as endomysial inflammation and an attack by autoaggressive lymphocytes on non-necrotic myofibers, were absent. The (HLA) class I (or class ABC) immunohistochemistry study was strongly positive, demonstrating surface labeling and sarcoplasmic staining of all myofibers in the sample. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated no upregulation of utrophin, which is normal, and normal patterns of expression of dystrophin N-terminal, C-terminal, and rod domain epitopes, for \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-sarcoglycan, and for laminin-2-\u03b1, \u03b2-dystroglycan, dysferlin, and emerin. Electron microscopy demonstrated no specific ultrastructural abnormalities within myofibers; there were only nonspecific pathological findings in a few necrotic myofibers.",

Still, the rapid onset of symptoms and clinical response to IVIg would be highly unlikely in a muscular dystrophy, so this type of testing was not pursued. A paraneoplastic syndrome is possible, 12 but this would be unlikely in an individual of this age and clinical presentation.

(B) Detail of a region included in the previous image (A). White arrows indicate 2 necrotic myofibers. There is moderately severe myofiber atrophy. Some of the atrophic myofibers in this area are regenerating, as identified by their basophilic (slightly blue) cytoplasm and large nuclei. (C) This region of a paraffin H&E section has a focus of very mild perimysial lymphocytic inflammation. Multiple regenerating myofibers are present in this area, some identified by the black arrows. (D) The human leukocyte antigen class I immunohistochemistry study demonstrates labeling of the surfaces of myofibers and staining of sarcoplasm; this study is considered strongly positive, which provides evidence of an immune-mediated process.
