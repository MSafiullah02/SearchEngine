Pandemics are usually characterized by a sense of panic and uncertainties. Even though, global preparedness and emergency procedures have been enacted [2] , the uncertainties surrounding this pandemic raise considerable questions to their adherence. Widespread restrictions of varying degrees have been placed on individuals, groups, communities, cities or even whole regions. These restrictions ab initio are in contradiction to civil and human rights. These measures which are now widely implemented in many regions and countries of the globe have thrown up fresh ethical questions. Between human health and human rights, which takes primacy?",

Given that humans are the vectors as well as the victims, minimizing human interaction through social distancing, quarantine and isolation is the most appropriate action to take [9] . The use of these methods though old fashioned [10] , in dealing with pandemics appear to be the most immediate and feasible solution now. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, these same measures were useful in curbing the disease [11] . Hence, an increasing number of nations are restricting travels in and out of their territories, cancelling public gatherings, enforcing quarantine and isolation on individuals as well as declaring partial or total lockdown of socio-economic activities. [9] . It is expected that emergency preparedness will impact on not only human health but civil and human rights as well [12] .

Paternalism involves restrictions on freedom for the sake of protecting or promoting that individual's best interest; giving priority to wider societal implications than individual rights. The right of individuals to health includes protecting and preventing them from contacting diseases. This helps to ensure that long term interests take precedence over short term interests. Public health policies, which focus primarily on population-level health outcomes, may therefore subordinate the interests and rights of individuals to the common good [14, 15] . Going by this, there seem to be an unofficial consensus that human health takes primacy over human rights.",
