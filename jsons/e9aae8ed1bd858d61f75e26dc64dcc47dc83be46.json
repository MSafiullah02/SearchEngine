Naked DNA was also inhaled as a control. Luciferase activity was determined at 24 h post-administration in the nasal cavity and lung ( Figure 5 ). In the nasal cavity, the naked DNA and their lipid formulation complexes followed a dose-dependent expression. At 40 \u00b5g of DNA, LE3 yielded more than 1000 times higher luciferase activity than naked DNA. In lungs of mice administered with 40 \u00b5g of DNA, the expression level of LE4/DNA increased more than 500-fold than that of the corresponding naked DNA controls, which showed higher expression levels than the LP3/DNA complex. No signs of toxicity were noticed when the DNA dose was below 40 \u00b5g per mouse. One of the main obstacles to the development of gene therapy for the airway is the inability of current viral vectors to direct sustained expression of a therapeutic transgene [14] . Thus, the duration of protein expression after intranasal emulsion-mediated transfection using the luciferase system was also evaluated. In all transfected groups, the highest level of expression was observed at day 1 in both the nasal cavity and lung. Luciferase expression persisted 24 days after transfection with DNA/emulsion complexes, although the degree of decline was steeper in lung than in the nasal cavity. About 1% of expression level by LE3/DNA and LE4/DNA complexes at day 1 remained in both tissues after 24 days (Figures 6A and 6C ).

There, however, may be a potential concern of mucosal gene transfer using a cationic emulsion, induction of an immune response against the carrier/DNA complex resulting in lack of persistent transgene expression. To check this potential adversity, we re-transfected respiratory tracts intranasally 14 days after the first transfection with DNA and the complexes ( Figures 6B and 6D ).

The enhanced in vivo transfection activity with the emulsion in the nasal cavity and lung could be explained by a number of possibilities. One of these may be the difference of DNA degradation in lipid carrier/DNA complexes by mucosal secretions. The DNA in the complex must survive and deliver intact DNA to the target cells in the nasal mucosa. In mucosal secretions, there are many anionic materials that can compete with and substitute DNA in the complex. The released DNA is vulnerable to nuclease attack [15] . Such a substitution has been assumed to be a major destabilization mechanism for the lipid/DNA complex [12, 15, 16] . In addition to mucosal secretions, a recent report revealed that lung surfactants markedly inhibited cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer [17, 18] . The stability of the DNA/emulsion complexes was investigated by observing the competitive exchange between heparin or Newfectan and DNA in the complexes in the presence of DNase. For the counterpart liposome/DNA complex, the plasmid began to dissociate as the equivalency of heparin increased above unity. A similar pattern was observed with the commercialized liposome, Lipofectamine (data not shown). In distinct contrast, the emulsion did not release its plasmid in the presence of destabilizers. Thus, the complex between DNA and the emulsion is extremely stable and is resistant to the competitive exchange by an anionic proteoglycan. As a consequence, DNA complexed with emulsion could be protected from a DNase attack. From these observations, we conclude that the stable emulsion/DNA complex provided a necessary protection against inactivation by mucosal secretions and a higher accessibility of the active DNA to airway epithelia than the liposome/DNA complex. It has not been reported clearly that the stability of complexes is relevant to transfection activity under in vivo conditions. Sternberg et al. have investigated the morphology and transfection activity both in vitro and in vivo [29] . In that report, they were able to obtain stable complexes by substituting cholesterol for DOPE as a helper lipid, by adding PEG 2000 PE as steric stabilizer after the complex formation, and by pre-condensing DNA with spermidine. These stability-increased complexes showed a high expression of transgene in the lung after intravenous administration. We also have investigated the relationship between structural stability and in vivo transfection activity of complexes with stability-modulated emulsions by changing the oil component in the emulsion [24] . In that study, the most stable emulsion with squalene as the oil phase gave the most potent transfection activity after intravenous administration. These observations demonstrated that in vivo transfection activity was primarily associated with the stability of the complexes [30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 762, "end": 766, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 771, "end": 774, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2135, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2687, "end": 2691, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2970, "end": 2974, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We further investigated the morphology of the emulsion/DNA complex using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

In this experiment, the emulsion and DNA appeared to be fully combined at C/D = 4 and formed a chromatin-like structure. It has been reported that a liposome loses its structural integrity during the formation of liposome/DNA complexes in which DNA is sandwiched between lamellar lipid sheets or forms a hexagonal phase [31, 32] . Unlike liposomal carriers, however, the cationic emulsion even retains its structural integrity during the formation of emulsion/DNA complexes.
