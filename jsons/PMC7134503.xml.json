To decide if a person requires transmission-based precautions, there has to be an infection risk assessment at every patient admission. This infection risk assessment is, therefore, a critical standard precautions action. This assessment is where patients with diarrhoea, vomiting, infected wounds, symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis or at high-risk of carrying a multi-drug-resistant organism are identified as presenting an infection risk to others; as a consequence, transmission-based precautions commence in addition to standard precautions.",

Any procedure that involves an invasive device or access to a sterile body area presents a high risk of infection and should be avoided wherever possible. Where the procedures cannot be avoided, they should be practised in such a way as to minimize risks. Such procedures include safe invasive device procedures (including endoscopy) and safe injection practices (including intravenous drug preparation and lumbar puncture).\n",
