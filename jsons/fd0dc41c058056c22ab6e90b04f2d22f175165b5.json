Some viruses produce proteins that are directly toxic to the cell. These proteins may be structural proteins or replication enzymes, but have lethal effects on the cell. In most cases, however, the death of the cell results from the virus ''take over'' of the cellular machinery for virus replication. Interference with cellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis may occur. The structures of the cell, including cell membrane and cytoskeleton, may be perturbed. Many viruses induce cell lysis for release from the cell, whereas others induce apoptosis. At a minimum, the function of the cell may be altered, and at most, the cell is destroyed. Lastly, cell death or injury may result from the host's immune response to the virus. This is due to destruction of infected cells and to so-called ''bystander killing'' of adjacent cells. Significant tissue damage can result in persistent infections where the antigen persists. Lesions may be due to production of immune complexes, cell-mediated destruction, and complement activation [5] .",

Examples of single-stranded RNA virus families include Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae. Double-stranded RNA virus families include Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Viruses replicate only in living cells and have no energy-yielding apparatus. Unlike bacteria, binary fission does not occur with viruses",
