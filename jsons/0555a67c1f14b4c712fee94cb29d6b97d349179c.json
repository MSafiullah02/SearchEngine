Additionally, political killings, which drone attacks often accomplish, are outlawed in the United States. 3 The crime is made more heinous when it is committed in foreign lands without the consent of the State concerned, and with callous disregard to the sovereignty of that State. The only exception to the use of drones in a foreign land (and this does not extend to arbitrary attacks that might involve non combatants) is in authorized armed conflict such as in instances where the international community, through the United Nations Security Council, authorizes such use in battle zones.",

This limb of law is also known as the law of war, the laws and customs of war or the law of armed conflict. Basically, international humanitarian law encompasses four limbs, the first being that persons who are not, or are no longer, taking part in hostilities shall be respected, protected and treated humanely. They should be given appropriate care, without any discrimination. Secondly, captured combatants and other persons whose freedom has been restricted are required to be treated humanely. They should be protected against all acts of violence, in particular against torture and if they are brought to trial they have the right to enjoy the fundamental guarantees of a regular judicial procedure. Thirdly, the right of parties to an armed conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. No superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering should be inflicted. Finally, in order to spare the civilian population, armed forces are required at all times to distinguish between the civilian population and civilian objects on the one hand, and military objectives on the other. Neither the civilian population as such nor individual civilians or civilian objects should be the target of military attacks.",

The leading aeronautical consultant Reg Austin reasons that UA is technically different than drone. 9 Another extension of UA is the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles [UCAV] which is armed and specifically assigned to attack each target. 10 However, since the term drone has been popularized in the mainstream media, for the purposes of this paper the term UA will be interchangeably used with drones.",

Richard Newman notes that \"Predator became an instant hit because it could transmit live video footage of enemy actions to commanders on the ground and aircrews above the battlefield. It illuminated targets for precision weapons fired from afar. It even, on occasion, fired its own weapons, a rarity for a UAV.\" 13 At present, Global Hawk is widely regarded to have taken over the Predator and has been flown over the Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Kosovo, Pakistan and Yemen. As one writer put it \"Global Hawk does much broader surveillance. It flies at elevations of 60,000 feet or more, like the U-2, and has higher resolution cameras than the Predator. Global Hawk can fly for nearly day and a half without being refueled, meaning it can take off from a base 1,200 miles away, loiter for 24 hours, then fly back.\" 14 Today, the sky is no longer the exclusive domain of the birds or jumbo jets as thousands of UA are hovering all over the skies.",

Less operating costs, low fuel and maintenance costs, cheaper insurance and low salaries for the ground based personnel all translate into a lucrative monetary benefits to pursue UA for commercial purposes. Due to financial benefits associated with the UA, it is likely that UA rental business will soon sell their services. 17 Manned helicopters have been used in South Africa and Australia to monitor herds during hot weather and difficult terrains but it may save time and money if UA are used to keep track of these herds. 18 UA could be in hands of news channels and broadcasting companies for covering emergency events, real-time sports events, monitoring traffic accidents and war zones. 19 For the first time, the United Nations has ordered surveillance drones from an Italian firm for its peacekeeping missions in Congo and diplomats hope that if successful the drones could be deployed for missions in Ivory Coast and South Sudan. 20 The advertisement line for drones is catchy, who wants to buy an expensive three million police helicopter when a much cheaper drone can do the same job more effectively.

The militaries of various nations are quickly learning to develop UA capable of delivering lethal blow to the enemy taking advantage of the loopholes in the current international legal framework on the legitimate use of drones. 22 In 2001, a Predator evolved into a UCAV from a reconnaissance UA when it fired a Hellfire-C laser guided missile at a tank. 23 Meanwhile, the Israeli Defence Forces [IDF] have been using the UA for multiple intelligence and data gathering programs from 1980s. 24 Japan has been developing the UA for dual purposes i.e. both civilian and military uses since World War II. 25 The South Korean government has developed a smart vertical take-off and landing UA and is on the verge of developing an upgraded version of the US Eagle Eye tiltrotor UA. 26 The Italian Air Force has its hands on a precision strike UA and Rome is negotiating a \"black\" medium-altitude, long-endurance [MALE] project that would 19 Ibid. 20 The U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that \"Unarmed UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) will allow our peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo to monitor the movements of armed groups and protect the civilian population more efficiently. The selected vendor is the Italian company Selex ES. The UAV is known as the Falco and is designed to be a medium altitude, medium endurance surveillance platform capable of carrying a range of payloads including several types of high resolution sensors.\" See Nichols (2013) . 21 Roberts (2013) . 22 Ibid. 23 Lazarski (2002) . 24 Bone and Bolkcom (2003) be flying in 2017-2018 told the Air Force Lt. Gen. Claudio Debertolis, Italy's secretary general of defence and national armaments director. 27 The Russian military has long collaborated with France's Dassault for manufacturing UAVs and is now acquiring the so-called mini-class of the drones. 28 Germany is in negotiations with Israel over the Heron UAV and with the U.S. for the Reaper UAV. \"A Government spokesman told AFP: 'The intention is that we acquire 16 such devices in future and that the armed forces have them at their disposal from 2016, three years from now.'\" 29 France made a $1.5 billion foreign military sales agreement with the US to buy 16 Reapers (UAVs) developed by General Atomics. 30 \"Britain bought US Predator drones and rented Israeli drones for use in Britain's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. . .the Watch keeper system for surveillance, and two separate BAE armed drones.\" 31 Besides conventional reconnaissance and surveillance the UCAVs can perform multiple offensive and defensive tasks such as \"suppression of enemy air defenses [SEAD] , close air support [CAS] , defensive counter air [DCA] , offensive counter air [OCA] , and air interdiction [AI] .\" 32 UA are increasingly used from reconnaissance to surveillance to security to border patrolling to law and order operations and every possible imaginable task. It is only a matter of time that drones will become a modern military necessity for each state. 33 One better pay heed to the words of General Petraeus, former head of the US Central Command, \"[w]e can't get enough drones\". 34 UA importance resonated with former CIA Director Leon Panetta affirming that the unmanned aerial vehicles are \"[t]he only game in town\" 35 when it comes to tackling Al-Qaeda. 27 Butler (2013). 28 Denis Fedutinov, a UAV expert described these new state of the art UAVs, \"These are the shortrange systems, with a range measuring from 5 kilometres to 25 kilometres, Denis Fedutinov says. These are small devices that are comparable to a model aero-plane. But they are very effective in ensuring the transmission of video-and photo-images in real time, and they can also reconnoitre over by the hill, in the close-in zone. These devices make it possible for the lowest-echelon units to quickly obtain intelligence and operational information and depend in no way on higher-echelon air-reconnaissance systems.\" See Nekhai (2013). 29 Evans (2013) . 30 Harthy (2013) . 31 Cole and Wright (2010a) . 32 Peterson (2005) , Published at 18. 33 See Friedman (2010), p. 33, Friedman notes, \"Militaries adopt revolutionary technology and tactics because they cannot go on the way they have been operating. In some cases, such as ours, circumstances make the existing way of war either literally impossible or unaffordable-or there are new requirements that existing forces cannot meet. In others the general adoption of some new technology makes it impossible to go on as before.\" 34 See Capaccio (2010) . \" [t] he new aviation plan projects spending for all aircraft to increase to $29 billion by 2020 from about $22 billion in fiscal 2011, an average of 3 percent annual growth adjusted for inflation.\" 35 Shachtman (2009). foreign UA the fear of repercussions of shooting down a drone would make them think twice. But recently in May 2013, the Al-Shabaab militants shot a US drone in Somalia and posted pictures on the Twitter. The US officials confirmed the incident but did not provide any specifications to drone model believed to be one of Schiebel UAVs. 42 In an another case, the Russians in collaborations with Iranians observed the US drone's routes and its surveillance of Iranian skies, hacked into the drone system and forced it to land in Iran on 4 December 2011. 43 The Russians helped decode American drone RQ170s intercepted by the Iranians in exchange for antidefense air system S300. 44 Despite the request by the US government to return it back, the Iranians have refused to comply and diplomatic tensions have escalated since then. Nonetheless, State reserves the right to regulate or prohibit the carriage in or above its territory in the interests of public order, safety, and above all its sovereignty.",

            "text": "What is the status of UA under international air law? The Chicago Convention, 49 the Magna Carta for aviation and the primary bedrock source of the public international air law-in Article 3 distinguishes between civil and state aircraft. A distinct anomaly is observed in the question as to \"how an international treaty, which on the one hand prescribes that it applies only to civil aircraft [Art. 3(a)], turns around and prescribes a rule for State aircraft [Art.3(c) ].\" 50 However, Article 3 does not provide a definition but at best gives a rebuttable presumption as those aircrafts utilized in furtherance of state activities such as search and rescue, natural disasters, governmental transport, and other state related services can be categorized as State aircraft. 51 This is far from a comprehensive definition and unreliable since the same Unmanned aircraft can transform into 'civil' or 'state' aircraft depending on the course of function. 52 Whether UA is a 'civil' or 'state' aircraft raises different set of obligations and liabilities. If UA is a state aircraft, then UA would not come within the purview of Chicago Convention. If UA is a civil aircraft, then it would fall under the jurisdiction of ICAO and national laws. Some distinguishable characteristic of the Unmanned Aircraft for the purposes of interception and regulation can be the i) design of UA, ii) registration marks, iii) ownership, and iv) type of operation. 48 Annex 2 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, \"Rules of the Air\", 2.1.1 Note. 49 Convention on International Civil Aviation also known as the Chicago Convention was signed at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. See ICAO doc 7300/9 Ninth Edition, 2006. 50 Abeyratne (2010), p. 168. 51 In the absence of any definition of 'military services' the interpretation must be done in accordance with the Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties that \"ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" 52 See, Accident Investigation Board Report, August 1996, at 4 when USAF CT-43 A, a military equivalent of B-737 -200 carrying VIP Croatian officials crashed at Dubrovnik on 3 April 1996; the investigation report deemed the aircraft as civil aircraft per Article 3 of the Convention. See also, Resolution 1562 (2007) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe titled \"Secret detention and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member States\" which was critical of countries involved with US authorities in transporting suspected terrorists in Gulfstream civilian aircrafts online at http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?Link\u00bc/documents/ adoptedtext/ta07/eres1562.htm. In the aftermath of 911, special rendition flights were performed to transport high-value terrorists for questioning in countries where they would not enjoy immunity against torture. The aircrafts identified were civilian B-737 and had US nationality marks but were used in a secret operative manner that would categorize them as State aircrafts. See also Milde (2008), pp. 477-486. i) Design: In 2010, CIA deployed micro UA in Pakistan, approximately the size of a pizza platter specially designed to survey targets with more precision in order to minimize civilian causalities. 53 The drone operators also changed tactics by targeting terrorists in vehicles rather than residences to reduce collateral damage. However, the difficulty to distinguish UA lies in the fact when they can be easily re-modified for other purposes. ii) Registration: The registration bearings can also distinguish an aircraft. However, the nationality and registration itself are insufficient proof that an aircraft is used solely for state or civil purpose. In a well-documented case of civil airplane B-737 MisrAir flight 2843 from Cairo to Tunis, suspected of carrying terrorists under Military Police escort was intercepted by US fighter planes and forced to land in Italy. The US explained its action stating that \"it is our view that the aircraft was operating as a State aircraft at the time of interception. The relevant factors -including exclusive State purpose and function of the mission, the presence of armed military personnel on board and the secrecy under which the mission was attempted -compel this conclusion.\" 54 iii) Ownership: The ownership may indicate that whether the aircraft is owned by the State or by a private entity. However, the problem arises where a state contracts out its military duties to private security contractors. For instance, the US State Department is operating surveillance drones to protect the US embassy in Iraq and is accepting bids from private security contractors to manage the drones program. 55 This has outraged the Iraqi officials who believe this program is an affront to Iraqi sovereignty. 56 Thus, ownership itself does not prove that the UA is used in state or a civil operation rather it further complicates the matter when the UA are contracted to private military security companies in the event liability arises. 57 53 Warrick and Finn (2010) . 54 ICAO document LC/29-WP/2-1 (1994) at pp. 11-12. 55 As Schmitt and Schmidt reported, \"American contractors say they have been told that the State Department is considering to field unarmed surveillance drones in the future in a handful of other potentially high-threat countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan, and in Afghanistan after the bulk of American troops leave in the next two years. . .The drones are the latest example of the State Department's efforts to take over functions in Iraq that the military used to perform. Some 5,000 private security contractors now protect the embassy's 11,000-person staff, for example, and typically drive around in heavily armored military vehicles.\" See Schmitt and Schmidt (2012 In an another case, the Elbit Systems which is a defense electronics manufacturer, trades on NASDAQ and sells Unmanned Aircraft systems to many countries around the world. Although, 45 % shares are owned by Micheal Federmann, due to its close connections with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Elbit Systems has been a target of the pro-Palestinian BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement due to the use of its Hermes 450 drone in West Bank and Gaza. 58 iv) Type of Operation: The type of operation can prove the nature of either the UA flight for civil or secret state purpose. The drone operations in Yemen planned to go after Al-Qaeda in a way that they cannot escape, qualifies these drones as state aircrafts. For example, the CIA drone operation killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born leader of a Yemen Al-Qaeda network without affording him an opportunity for a trial. Besides, these drone strikes have increased resentment both against the Yemeni and the US government. 59",

Post modernist thinking was geared to accepting that human culture, as we knew it from a social and economic perspective, was reaching an end. This school of thought associated itself with the momentum of industrial society, drawing on an image of pluralism of cultures and a multitude of groups. The interaction between political modernism, which brought to bear the globalization of nations and deconstruction of separatism of human society, while at the same time ascribing to the individual certain rights at international law that transcended natural legislation parameters, has been symbiotic and essentially economic.

The principle of humanity law was immutably established with no room for doubt in 1986 when the ICJ in the Nicaragua Case evolved \"elementary considerations of humanity\" which essentially devolved responsibility of ensuring the safety and security of humanity on the State even outside treaty law, such as the provisions contained in the 1949 Geneva Conventions on International Humanitarian Law. 72 The future of UA will largely depend on how technology, regulators, and states can work in tandem. As already discussed, the status of an unmanned aircraft can be ascertained by the actual function it is performing at the given moment. Any UA on a particular journey would be considered military if it is surveying for a combat mission, other time the same UA can be considered civil if it is surveying for a humanitarian relief. Hence, the status of each flight must be pre-approved by the approved flight plan accepted by the States to be flown above and should beforehand specify the nature of the flight. As history unfolds and technology advances the future of UAVs will largely rely on the governmental funding of its research and development. The advances in technology will not only decrease the costs as the demand increases but their easy availability may raise the problems of UA getting in wrong hands.

More than 12 years have passed since the outrageous and catastrophic events of 11 September 2001. Yet, none of us can get over the outrage we felt at the dastardly terrorist acts which killed nearly 3,000 people in a day. Most of the world that day felt an amalgam of concern, fear, and anger that motivated us to take precautions. Overnight, we converted ourselves from a society that was both laid back and reactive to a society that took pre-emptive and preventive action to make sure such things never happened again. For purposes of definition, Preemption is when an act, which is potentially harmful to a State and is imminent, is effectively precluded by military or other action. Prevention is when an act, which is potentially harmful to a State and is inevitable, is effectively precluded by military or other action. 71 Corfu Channel Case, (United Kingdom v.

These practices, however well meant from a strategic context, inevitably give rise to the law of outrage. Referring to the Holocaust during World War II President Roosevelt said on October 7, 1942: \"It is our intention that just and sure punishment shall be meted out to the ringleaders responsible for the organized murder of thousands of innocent persons in the commission of atrocities which have violated every tenet of the Christian faith.\" The next year Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill vowed, through the Moscow Declaration, to bring the perpetrators to justice. On 26 October 1943 the United Nations War Crimes commission composed of 15 allied nations met for the first time in London. On March 24, 1944 President Roosevelt again issued the warning: \"None who participate in these acts of savagery will go unpunished. All who share in the guilt shall share the punishment\". The last sentence was reiterated in a different way by Present George W. Bush in the aftermath of the events of 9/11: Every nation has a choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they will take that lonely path at their own peril. 74",

In instances of hooliganism and vandalism as in the London riots of 2011 the statement in Parliament of Prime Minister David Cameron during: \"We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets.

It then resolved, again inter alia, to encourage all Member States of ICAO to continue to promote the ideals and principles of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and compliance with its provisions; and acknowledged the critical need for continued ICAO efforts aimed at identifying the challenges posed by increases in global air transport demand and capacity, as well as the opportunities offered by new and emerging technologies, and to address those challenges and take advantage of those opportunities in order to achieve the safe, secure and sustainable growth of the international civil aviation system. The Resolution also invited all stakeholders, including Member States and relevant organizations of the global civil aviation community, to continue sharing and promoting best practices and working together through ICAO in support of a worldwide air transport system, which serves and benefits all nations and peoples of the world. Ironically, nowhere in this Resolution is mention that the Council was mindful of instances when aviation was used over the past 70 years to attack and destroy communities and societies.

At its 33rd session held in Montreal from 25 September to 5 October 2001, the ICAO Assembly adopted Resolution A33-1 77 which was a direct response to the terrorist acts of 9/11. The Resolution recognized that a new type of threat was posed to civil aviation which required new concerted efforts and policies of cooperation on the part of States. The Resolution also urges all ICAO member States to ensure, in accordance with Article 4 of the Chicago Convention, that civil aviation is not used for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the Convention, and to hold accountable and punish severely those who misuse civil aircraft as weapons of destruction, including those responsible for planning and organizing such acts or for aiding, supporting or harbouring perpetrators. It also called upon States to cooperate with each other in this endeavour and to ensure that ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) relating to aviation security are adhered to.

It also states that it is desirable to avoid friction and to promote co-operation between nations and peoples upon which the peace of the world depends. In pursuance of these objectives, governments signed the Convention that contains certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically.",

The ICAO rules apply on all international flights. For national flights, i.e. flights within one country, national civil aviation authorities apply national legislation. This is normally based on the ICAO 81 Wagner et al. (2006) . Bio surveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism). It is worthy of note that in addition to activity in this field in the United States, there is also work being done in Europe, where disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on a continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergencies. The system not only monitors infected persons, but also attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak. 82 Guidance on Regulation for the Transport of Infectious Substances, World Health Organization, September 2005, WHO/CDS/CSR/ LYO/2005.22. 83 For the purposes of transport, infectious substances are defined as substances which are known or are reasonably expected to contain pathogens. Pathogens are defined as microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) and other agents such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or animals. The definition is applied to all specimens except those explicitly excluded in the WHO Guidance Material. 84 The international regulations for the transport of infectious substances by any mode of transport are based upon the Recommendations made by the Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UNCETDG), a committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Recommendations are presented in the form of Model Regulations. The United Nations Model Regulations are reflected in international law through international modal agreements. 85 It is widely recognized that SARS is not a disease but a syndrome. See generally, Ruwantissa and Abeyratne (2002), pp. 53-80. provisions, but may incorporate variations. State and operator variations are published in the ICAO Technical Instructions and in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The WHO guidelines also contain detailed packing instructions regarding infectious substances. 86 Regionally, there is direct provision with regard to safety provisions that impact on protecting humanity at large. For instance, European Union Regulation EC 3922/1991 87 prescribes common standards for consistency and harmonization in the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of aircraft. The United Kingdom has focused regulations, such as the Air Navigation Order 2005 (CAP 393), Article 69 of which prohibits aircraft from carrying munitions of war 88 unless they are carried under a letter of authority of the Civil Aviation Administration and the commander of the aircraft is advised in writing of all details of the consignment carried in his aircraft, such details to be given to the commander prior to take off.",

Some of the aviation companies serving the Iran-Contra operations in Europe, the Middle East and Central America were also engaged at the same time in arms and military supply operations in Angola and DR Congo. . . One of the first documented flights occurred on April 9, 1983, when Southern Air Transport 61 \"Flight SJ1466 (carried out by an L-100), supposedly en route from Panama to Tegucigalpa, landed instead at Palmerola AFB, under secret instructions given to the pilot by SAT management. The plane transported 22 tons of small arms and ammunition picked up in Panama. Also in 1983, other companies, such as Summit Aviation, Investair and Westair Intl., provided the Contras with light planes, used for operations inside Nicaragua. In 1985 and 1986 , several other arms shipments reached the Contras, mainly\" own by Southern Air Transport (contracted by Richard Gadd's Eagle Aviation Service and Technology, EAST and AirMach), Arrow Air (subcontracted by SAT) and F. A. Conner Air. North's associates also organized large arms shipments from Portugal, through the shell companies ACE and Energy Resources as well as through arms dealers in Portugal and Canada. North's associates used forged Guatemalan Army end-user certi! cates and diverted the arms from their supposed destinations in Guatemala to Contra bases. The shipments included arms and ammunition worth about USD5.6 million altogether, with a volume that added up to some 800 tons. 91 a 2007 Regulation, based upon the ICAO's Standards and Recommended Practices and the European Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), transportation of munitions are generally forbidden. In India, India according to rule 8 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, arms, ammunition, munitions of war, implements of war, explosives etc. shall be carried to, from, within or over India only with the written permission of the Central Government and subject to the terms and conditions of such permission. 675 The power to issue permission is delegated to officers of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Under the Civil Aviation Rules (1994) of Pakistan, the country prohibits the carriage of weapons or parts thereof, or ammunition or constituents thereof, which are designed for use in warfare, or against a person. 678 Only the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority can authorize the carriage of such items. Article 41 paragraph 1 of the Air Navigation Order of Singapore prohibits the carriage of munitions of war on aircraft. Munitions of war are defined as \"such weapons and ammunition designed for use in warfare or against the person, including parts designed for such weapons and ammunition\". 90 See Danssaert and Finardi (2011) , at note 58 where the authors say: \"According to FBI investigators, Raul Arana, an agent for Contra leader Fernando Chamorro,\" flew \"several large arms shipments from Miami to Honduras in 1981\", see Walcott and Paztor (1987) . 91 Id.

State Sovereignty is all about control over a society. However, it is also about legitimacy, as the Montevideo principles enunciated. It has to be noted that, from a purely academic perspective, the concept goes back several centuries. The doctrine of sovereignty was introduced to the Western world by the French philosopher Bodin. At a time when political attitudes were in transition from the dominance of the universal church to a universal legal order, Bodin introduced sovereignty as a supreme power over citizens and subjects that was not itself bound by laws. Bodin elaborated that every independent community had to consider that while acknowledging the authority of the law, a State was above the law if it wished to govern successfully. Other jurists who supported the theory of exclusive sovereignty were Hugo Grotius, who maintained that sovereign States were independent of foreign control, and Thomas Hobbes, who said that sovereignty was absolute and its misuse was unthinkable. John Locke attempted to compromise the absolute quality of sovereignty by opining that sovereignty was not absolute and unquestionable in that it was an exchange of social trust between the government and the people. Accordingly, there was an inarticulate premise that a breach of the social trust between the two parties would erode the concept of sovereignty. This brings one to the inexorable conclusion that, in the ultimate analysis the sovereignty of a nation, and therefore its independence, lies in a stable population that subscribes to the aspirations of the people. This is the ultimate value of self determination, legitimacy and independence.",

Judge Sette-Camara quoted the International Law Commission and observed: The Court in this case has therefore clearly arranged legal priorities in such a manner that the United Nations Charter is paramount over any other moral or ethical argument on humanitarian assistance. Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport at Port -au-Prince had only one runway which is 9,900 ft. in length. There is only one parking area at which only 44 aircraft can be accommodated at any given time. Because only one aircraft can land or depart from this runway at the same time, and because aircraft must be separated by a certain time to avoid collisions, the airport has a finite capacity. Air traffic control can also be limiting, since there are only so many aircraft an air traffic control unit can safely handle. Additionally, staff shortages, radar maintenance or equipment faults can lower the capacity of a unit. This can affect both airport air traffic control as well as en-route air traffic control centers. 114 The fundamental principle with regard to the provision of air traffic services is contained in Annex 11 to the Chicago Convention which provides that the need for the provision of air traffic services is determined by the types of air traffic involved; the density of air traffic, 115 the meteorological conditions and such other factors as may be relevant. 116 The main objective of the air traffic control service is to prevent collisions between aircraft and between aircraft and obstructions in the maneuvering area and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. 117 The objective of airspace management is to maximize, within a given airspace structure the utilization of available airspace by dynamic time-sharing and, at times, segregation of airspace among various categories of users based on short term needs. 118 The objective of air traffic flow management is to ensure an optimum flow of air traffic to or through areas during times, when demand exceeds or is expected to exceed available capacity of the air traffic floor system. 113 Id. para. 199. 114 http://www.airtrafficmanagement.net/view_news.asp?ID\u00bc1435 A seven member team from the US FAA is working with the Haitian government and the US Department of Defense (DOD) to supply technical assistance for air traffic management. The US Air force has successfully used the one-slot system which rapidly brings in an aircraft when one leaves. 115 At the time of writing, the US Air Force was to open a second relief centre distribution point at Jacmel Airport in the south of Haiti to relieve the pressure on Toussaint Louverture International Airport at Port-au-Prince. Some 200 flights a day were proving a colossal strain at Port-au-Prince and Jacmel will immediately be able to receive C-130 Hercules deliveries initially supporting Canadian humanitarian assistance efforts. One of the considerations in the context of relief flights in Haiti is that there could be both civil and military aircraft operating into Haiti. 119 From an aeronautical perspective, Annex 11 to the Chicago Convention, which deals with the subject of air traffic services, lays down requirements for coordination of activities that are potentially hazardous to civil aircraft. The International Standards and Recommended Practices in the Annex, Chapter 2, (2.17 and 2.18 in particular) contain provisions for co-ordination between military authorities and air traffic services and co-ordination of activities potentially hazardous to civil aircraft. These provisions specify that air traffic services authorities shall establish and maintain close co-operation with military authorities responsible for activities that may affect flights of civil aircraft. The provisions also prescribe that the arrangements for activities potentially hazardous to civil aircraft shall be co-ordinated with the appropriate air traffic services authorities and that the objective of this co-ordination shall be to achieve the best arrangements which will avoid hazards to civil aircraft and minimize interference with the normal operations of such aircraft. Standard 2.17.1 stipulates that arrangements for activities potentially hazardous to civil aircraft, whether over the territory of a State or over the high seas, shall be coordinated with the appropriate air traffic services authorities, such coordination to be effected early enough to permit timely promulgation of information regarding the activities in accordance with the provisions of Annex 15 to the Chicago Convention. Standard 2.17.2 of Annex 11 explains that the objective of the coordination referred to in the earlier provision shall be to achieve the best arrangements that are calculated to avoid hazards to civil aircraft and minimize interference with the normal operations of aircraft.",

The Question would essentially be ground in a legal analysis of the principles of humanitarian law and State sovereignty. On the one hand, everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person 126 and the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care. 127 On the other, there is overall recognition of the fact that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. Except for the Paris Convention of 1956, 128 which provides for civil aircraft registered in a member State of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) to fly freely into member States for the purposes of discharging or taking on traffic where such aircraft are engaged inter alia in non-scheduled flights for the purpose of meeting humanitarian or emergency needs, 129 there is no multilateral or bilateral agreement that admits of unilateral intervention of a State in another for humanitarian purposes, where the intervening State does not obtain permission of the recipient State. In fact, Resolution 46/182 130 explicitly provides in the Annex to the Resolution that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of States must be fully respected in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and that in this context, humanitarian assistance should be provided with the consent of the affected country and in principle on the basis of an appeal by the affected country. These conflicting principles, although not bestowing legal authority on the United Nations to intervene in a State with relief flights, at least give some degree of justification to the United Nations' efforts to mediate with States concerned in the International Conference of the Red Cross, shall apply in situations of armed conflict, and all parties to a conflict should make every effort to facilitate this application. promotion of relief operations and to seek the support of other States, with the concurrence of affected States.",

Once a ground control team from the Air Force's first Special Operations Wing began landing aircraft on January 13, a team from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Haitian authorities began working to restore navigation and communication capabilities. A team of U.S. military and civilian aviation experts working with Haitian officials began sorting flights, allowing some to land immediately based on what was needed most. 137 As per Article 1 of the Convention. The Convention applies only to State aircraft and not to military aircraft. However, it states, in Article 3 that no aircraft used in military, customs or police services shall fly over the territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof.

In this context, humanitarian assistance should be provided with the consent of the affected country and in principle on the basis of an appeal by the affected country.

Therefore, it is probably more accurate today to say that the sovereignty of a State means the residuum of power which it possesses within the confines laid down by international law. It is of interest to note that this conception resembles the doctrine of early writers on international, law, who treated the State as subordinate to the law of nations, then identified as part of the wider \"law of nature\". 140 Oppenheim holds a similar view that the \"traditional\" law of humanity is incorporated into contemporary international law. He views this attitude as: recognition of the supremacy of the law of humanity over the law of the sovereign State when enacted or applied in violation of human rights in a manner that may justly be held to shock the conscience of mankind. 141 Some authorities in international law also believe that intervention should, if absolutely necessary, be effected when there is cogent evidence of a breakdown in the minimum guarantees of humanity. 142 Accordingly, it may be argued that any act of intervention aimed at saving the lives of human beings which are in danger, would be legally and morally justifiable. Fernando Teson 143 argues that since the ultimate justification for the existence of States is the protection and enforcement of the natural rights of the citizens, a government that engages in substantial violations of human rights betrays the very purpose for which it exists and so forfeits not only its domestic legitimacy, but also its international legitimacy as well. He goes on to say: I suggest that from an ethical standpoint, the rights of States under international law are properly derived from individual rights. I therefore reject the notion that States have any autonomous moral standing -that they hold international rights that are independent from the rights of individuals who populate the State. 144 Schwarzenberger analyses the concept somewhat clinically and concludes that in the absence of an international jus cogens which corresponds to municipal jus cogens of advanced communities, where the latter prevents the worst excesses of inequality of power, the supremacy of the rule of force would prevail. 145 There is also a contrasting view that humanitarian intervention is generally resorted to by States only in instances of serious abuses of human rights by one State upon its people or others. Dr Michael Akehurst argues that if a State intervenes forcibly on the territory of another in order to protect the local population from serious human violations, such an armed intervention could inevitably constitute a temporary violation de facto of the territorial integrity of the latter State, and to an extent of its political independence, if carried out against its wishes. 146 Dr. Akehurst goes on to assert: Any humanitarian intervention, however limited, constitutes a temporary violation of the target State's political independence and territorial integrity if it is carried out against the State's wishes. 147 The doctrine of humanitarian intervention is thought of by some commentators as an invention of strategy to circumvent the strong jus cogens nature of the principle of sovereignty and inviolability of States which Dr. Akehurst refers to. Professor Brownlie is of the view that States have generally invoked the doctrine to give support to their commercial and strategic considerations. 148 The United Kingdom legislature recently considered the view of the British Minister of State who was of the view:",

For instance, a study made in relation to admissions to a psychiatric hospital in England draws a distinct relationship between the disturbed mental state of the admitted inmates of the hospital and high intermittent noise levels from Heathrow Airport, to which they were exposed. 159 One writer states that airport and industrial noise are the causes of mental stress and maladjustment, increases in chronic fatigue and neurotic complaints in some cases, although different personalities may underlie individual differences in noise effects. 160 Aircraft noise is at best a nuisance and at worst a gross infringement of a fundamental right. The issue of aircraft noise becomes even more critical in the face of noise curfews imposed by certain jurisdictions that force some States to have their carriers depart at night in order to beat night-time curfews imposed by the State at which the aircraft arrives. Several African States have raised this issue in the Council of ICAO in the context of African carriers facing night curfews in Europe-an issue brought up also by States such as India in the Council.",

The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.\" (Principle 7). 4. \"To achieve sustainable development and a higher quality of life for all people, States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of production and consumption . . .\" (Principle 8). 5. \"States shall enact effective environmental legislation. Environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply. Standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries.\" (Principle 11). 6. \"Environmental measures addressing trans-boundary or global environmental problems should, as far as possible, be based on an international consensus.\" (Principle 12). 168 Only two aircraft that will meet standards beyond those prescribed in Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention will be in production after the year 2000, namely the Boeing 747-400 and the Airbus A321. It is expected that by the year 2007, more than 70 % of the world airline fleet would meet the most stringent of the proposals under consideration by CAEP.

The Assembly also noted that noise concerned the public and civil aviation and was becoming a matter for concern with the increase in air traffic and that the introduction of future aircraft types could increase and aggravate the problem further unless action was taken to alleviate the problem. Accordingly, the Assembly resolved to instruct the ICAO Council to call an international conference within the machinery of ICAO as soon as possible; establish international specifications and associated guidance material relating to aircraft noise; and, to include, in the appropriate Annexes and other relevant ICAO documents and possibly in a separate Annex on noise, such material as the description and methods of measurement of aircraft noise and suitable limitations on the noise caused by aircraft that was of concern to communities in the vicinity of airports.",

As for psychological effects of the boom, it was noted by the Committee that it caused a startle reaction in the human being, in addition to a slight increase in heart rate which returned to normalcy within a very short period. It was also the Committee's view that the startle effects of the Concorde and TU-144 aircraft did not give rise to any significant circulatory effects. With regard to the sociological effects of the sonic boom, the Committee considered a study of the Concorde aircraft over Australia in June 1972 and concluded that this aspect be best studied as both a public and private law issue by the Legal Committee of ICAO.",

It is caused by the mach waves that an aircraft inevitably generates aerodynamically when it flies at a speed greater than that of sound.

The Assembly also recognized that the noise standards in Annex 16 were not intended to introduce operating restrictions on aircraft and that operating restrictions on existing aircraft would increase the costs of airlines and would impose a heavy economic burden, particularly on those airlines which do not have the financial resources to re-equip their fleets. Therefore, considering that resolution of problems due to aircraft noise must be based on the mutual recognition of the difficulties encountered by States and a balance among their different concerns, the Assembly, by Resolution A 28-3, urged States not to introduce any new operating restrictions on aircraft which exceed the noise levels in Volume I, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 before considering: a) whether the normal attrition of existing fleets of such aircraft will provide the necessary protection of noise climates around their airports; b) whether the necessary protection can be achieved by regulations preventing their operators from adding such aircraft to their fleets through either purchase, or lease/ charter/interchange, or alternatively by incentives to accelerate fleet modernization; c) whether the necessary protection can be achieved through restrictions limited to airports and runways the use of which has been identified and declared by them as generating noise problems and limited to time periods when greater noise disturbance is caused; and, d) the implications of any restrictions for other States concerned, consulting these States and giving them reasonable notice of intention",

This ban would also be calculated to affect the importation of such aircraft into the region. Legislation passed by the Union in April 1999 was intended to bar Chapter 3 compliant aircraft from European registries from 4 May 2000 (originally 1 April 1999, which is 3 years before the date specified in Resolution A32-8, namely, 1 April 2002) and to prohibit their operation into the countries of the European Union after 1 April 2002. Such action has been reportedly criticized by the Air Transport Association which claims that the inflexibility of such a deadline \"will severely undercut, if not destroy entirely -ICAO's efforts to address environmental issues on a uniform international basis\". 175 The action of the European Union seeks justification on the basis that the exponential air traffic growth in Europe will increase noise around European airports, requiring stringent noise standards. A related fear is reportedly that hush-kitted aircraft, which are rare in Europe, will find a new home in the Continent. Unlike in Europe, airlines in the United States have been somewhat prolific in the use of hush-kits in aircraft 176 and many United States carriers operate Stage 175 Flint (1999), p. 29. 176 It was reported that American Airlines is installing the Raisbeck System on 52 B 727 aircraft and hush-kitting 20 more. United is installing hush-kits on 75 B 727 aircraft and 24 B 737-200s. Delta is hush-kitting 104 727s and 54 737-200s. Southwest, TWA, Alaska Airlines and US Airways are other carriers who plan to hush-kit their Chapter 2 aircraft. See Flint (1999) , Id. at p. 34. 2 hush-kitted aircraft into Europe and even have based equipment in the Continent. At the time of writing, although the U.S. State Department had reacted forcefully to the European Union's hush-kitted aircraft ban, the application of which was extended by the Union until May 2000, it was reported that both the United States and the European Union were working together on a possible new ICAO Standard (presumably to be called Chapter 4). 177 The issue is a \"double edged sword\" involving two distinct disciplines. As discussed earlier, the European contention is based on the strictly legal issue of noise pollution and overtones of the tort of nuisance committed by operators whose aircraft are not compliant with Chapter 3 standards to the satisfaction of the European Union. Others who oppose what they claim to be a premature enforcement of ICAO standards, as contained in Resolution A32-8, argue that the European hush-kit rule would cost the manufacturing industry significant losses. It is reported that the United States industry would lose $2 billion if the ban is enforced in Europe as scheduled. 178 The aircraft noise issue has entered a phase where trading and environmental issues are at a delicate balance. On the one hand, competition issues pertaining to the sale of hush-kits and other equipment calculated to reduce aircraft engine noise to levels prescribed by ICAO are quite significant from the perspective of international trade, and on the other hand, environmental issues that have been addressed by the ICAO Council through CAEP and also by the Assembly should also be given careful consideration. As discussed earlier, ICAO Assembly Resolution A32-8 urges States to give consideration to the economic difficulties that some States may have to face in phasing out Chapter 2 aircraft by the year 2002. However, the Resolution does not leave room for States to claim that pure economic factors would effectively preclude them from phasing out Chapter 2 aircraft by the date stipulated in the Resolution.",

Contracting States are urged to adopt appropriate mechanisms in implementing this balanced approach, notably: in establishing a transparent process based on objective, measurable criteria for the assessment of the noise problem; in evaluating likely costs and benefits of various measures with a view to achieving maximum environmental benefit; and in providing for dissemination of the evaluation results that may be used in consultation with stakeholders and dispute resolutions.",

Before phasing out subsonic aircraft that may exceed the above mentioned noise levels, the Resolution also calls upon Contracting States to give careful thought to whether alternatively effective noise management can be achieved by applying regulations preventing operations of such aircraft through restrictions limited to airports and runways, the use of which has been identified and declared by these States as generating noise problems and limited to time periods when greater noise disturbance is caused. Finally, Contracting States are called upon to consider implications of any restrictions for other States concerned, through consultation and reasonable notification of the application of restrictions.",

This compromise recommends that such States frame any restrictions so that Chapter 2 compliant aircraft of an individual operator which are operating at present to their territories may be withdrawn from such operations gradually, over a period of not less than 7 years. The Resolution also requests Contracting States not to restrict before the end of the above period the operations of any aircraft less than 25 years after the date of issue of its first individual certificates of airworthiness, and, not to restrict before the end of the period the operations of any presently existing wide-body aircraft or of any fitted with engines that have a by-pass ratio higher than 2 to 1.

            "text": "The only Common Law cause of action which merits detailed discussion in this chapter is nuisance. The word \"nuisance\" remains the most uncertain word in legal terminology even though it has been put to diverse use by the judiciary. Its tentacles lie spread-eagled on a multitude of wrongs ranging from the noises made by animals to obnoxious smells. Perhaps the reason for this is due to the spontaneous human response of identifying any interference, obstruction or damage caused to an individual as a nuisance. In attempting to interpret the word \"nuisance\" the judiciary has been in a quandary. The meaning of the word \"nuisance\" has been stretched from \"a potential source of annoyance\" 181 to \"liability for any act of obstruction of the enjoyment of a legal right\". 182 Though the very concept of nuisance originated to retaliate against offences of a public nature, it has since been categorized into public and private nuisance. English common law rigidly classifies a public nuisance as a crime and a private nuisance as a civil wrong. 183 It is submitted that in the environmental law area it is the concept of private nuisance which is most relevant. The concept of private nuisance can be divided into a wrongful disturbance of land and a wrongful interjection of deleterious matter into land belonging to another. Therefore, private nuisance is particularly appropriate to claims founded upon excessive noise because it is directed at the interference with a person's interest in the peaceful use and enjoyment of his property. The basis of this branch of the law is the necessity of maintaining a balance between the right of an occupier to use and enjoy his property and the right of an occupier to be protected from interference or injury. 184 Therefore, courts when adjudicating on environmental disputes and determining whether the tort of private nuisance is present, have to balance the equities between the parties. This chapter will attempt to trace the manner in which the Anglo Australian judiciary has dealt with nuisance in noise pollution disputes.",

In this instance, a New South Wales court examined a resolution of a council which ordered the occupiers of premises to cause \"no noise\" in the use of such premises, between specified hours. In the context of the phrase \"no noise\" it was extremely difficult for Judge Betts, who delivered judgment, to examine whether the sound caused by machinery was noise which would amount to a breach of such by-law. The court cautiously observed that a liberal meaning should be attributed to \"noise\" as a strict interpretation of the term would hinder anyone in carrying out a business or industry. 186 Therefore, \"noise\" was identified as that which would carry beyond the confines of the premises it emanated from to such a degree or of such a nature in quality or volume as to interfere with the life of the residents of normal temperament in the neighbourhood. The interference referred to was further elaborated to be worry, inconvenience, annoyance, discomfort ir loss of sleep during the prohibited hours.",

Eventually, His Honour introduced an effective compromise by stating that any sound does not necessarily become noise unless it causes the discomfort specified above, and if it does, the person who suffers the annoyance is entitled to seek redress in order that the noise be abated by the person who causes it. Although the judgment seems fair and just for the time it was delivered, it does not suffice that such a general observation be applied in the present day when industry and population grow simultaneously and the consideration of sustainable development has become a pre-eminent factor in human development.",

The same criteria were used in different terminology to state that noise should be modulated so as not to inconvenience others and cause discomfort 188 and that noise caused by such things as hammers, building implements and loud speakers should not hinder the comfortable enjoyment of life by neighbours. 189 The judgment was followed verbatim by Manning J. in Bankstown Municipal Council v. Berzins 190 in which His Honour stated that noise is distinguishable from sound, in that noise, unlike sound, materially interferes with the ordinary comfort and convenience of residents of the neighbourhood. 191 The early attitude towards noise as environmental pollution does not differ in any way to that which was taken by the courts. The courts too were faced with the problem of being confronted by inadequately framed by-laws and the paucity of precedent which adequately defined noise. In Leslie v. City of Essendon, 192 a case decided in Victoria, Australia in 1902, Sholl J. dealt casually with noise by calling it \"loud sound\" 193 whereas Copell A.J., quoting from them Oxford English Dictionary preferred to expand the definition to a \"loud or harsh sound of any kinda din\". 194 It is not unreasonable to assume that in the light of the few cases decided, noise was always considered subjectively which made it difficult for courts to ascertain whether in any given instance a person aggrieved had a cause of action. What was lacking was a definite idea of what the basic human tolerance level was. At that time courts did not even mention the possibility of excessive noise causing injury to the human ear. However, as was mentioned earlier, the above cases were decided between 1936 and 1957 during which time medical science, though not totally unaware of the detrimental effects of noise on the human ear, had not published sufficient material on the subject.",

The principle of inverse condemnation has been identified as: the popular description of a cause against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by taking the agency. 207 and was brought to light by the seminal decision in the case of United States v. Causby, 208 decided in 1946, which involved repeated flights over the plaintiff's property by military aircraft, held that there had been a compensable interference with property and consequent taking down of its value which was at variance with the Fifth Amendment of the United States' Constitution. 209 The 1962 case of Thornburg v. Port of Portland 210 made a significant deviation from the usual principle that compensation for a nuisance caused by noise produced by aircraft could only be awarded if the aircraft was directly above the property concerned and ruled that a trespass resulting in nuisance could occur even if the noise was coming from an aircraft flying beside the property. The Thornburg principle was followed some years later in Martin v. Port of Seattle 211 which rejected the rigidity of the principle that, in the words of the court, insisted upon \"the wingtip of the aircraft passing through some fraction of an inch of the airspace directly above the plaintiff's land\". 212 The early English case of Walter v.

In determining what is a reasonable noise and what are plain, sober and simple notions the courts have had to consider the general nature of the neighbourhood, the nature of the location at which the alleged nuisance took place, the character, duration of time of occurrence of the noise and the effects of the noise. 216 In an early case 217 decided by the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, the ringing of a church bell in the early morning hours of Sunday and public holidays in such a manner as to disturb persons residing in the neighbourhood was considered a nuisance. The court took into account, among other things, the degree of the disturbance caused. This case could be contrasted with a South Australian case decided a few years later. 218 The plaintiff who lived 17 ft. away from the defendant's premises claimed an injunction and \u00a3500 in damages for depreciation of the value of his house by reason of the noises made by the defendant who conducted religious services on Sundays, commencing at 7 a.m. The noises the plaintiff complained of were singing, band playing, hand clapping and walking about the hall. It was held that singing in a place of religious worship is a sound considered to be ordinarily proceeding from such a place. Although the noises complained of in the two cases are similar, the judges in the South Australian case distinguished that case from the Victorian case on the basis that the necessary inference that can be drawn from the Victorian case is that the ringing of a church bell is not considered part of the service, whereas singing is a necessary part of religious worship. Whether such a distinction is logical is a moot point. Therefore, on similar facts the judges in the two cases came to different conclusions.",

Despite the protests of the company no effort had been made by the defendants to conduct their operations during hours when the plaintiff's business would not be affected.

Reed although it was held by Richards J. that \"the defendant had done very much to make the manner of carrying on his business unobjectionable\" 227 this was not considered enough to have abated the nuisance. In Aldridge v. Clough, Burt C.J. found that \"[E]ach step taken no doubt had some beneficial effect\" but His Honour too came to the same conclusion as Richards J.

The court using Pollock on Torts as an authority came to the conclusion that the use of a dwelling house in an ordinary and accustomed manner, is not a nuisance though it may produce more or less noise and inconvenience to a neighbour. 237 In Munro v. Southern Dairies Ltd. 238 the plaintiff complained of the noise and smell from the defendant's dairy. The court in determining whether the noise and the smell amounted to a nuisance took into consideration inter alia, the particular sensitivity if any, of the plaintiff. Sholl J. held that although a man is not entitled to relief merely because he may happen to be unduly sensitive to noise, yet a man who lives next door to premises from which the noise emanates may get relief when another man some distance away will fail to obtain it. 239 The American case of Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Company 240 is an example of a case in which the court was swayed by the economic position of the defendant company. 241 Here the plaintiff alleged property damage caused by the dirt and vibrations resulting from the defendant's industrial complex. The court recognized a substantial interference of the plaintiff's rights. Although the court cites the law in New York, which is to the effect that a nuisance will be found to exist even though there is marked disparity in economic consequence between the effect of the injunction and the effect of the nuisance, yet it strangely decided to ignore it on the basis that the rule should not be followed too \"literally\". 242 The court granted damages to the plaintiff instead of an injunction obviously because they were favourably impressed by the vast wealth of the defendant company and knew that a permanent injunction would have caused a significant loss to the company. The court may have been influenced in its decision by the loss of employment to the 300 workers of the defendant company if the court granted an injunction. However, the ability of the common law in protecting the ordinary citizen is illustrated in the English case of Halsey v. Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. 243 The plaintiff in this case lived in an area zoned for residential purposes. The defendant, who was a mammoth oil company, used a land on the opposite side as an oil storage depot. The plaintiff alleged nuisance resulting from the noise and smell of the defendant's operations. In this case the court refused to be awed by the economic position of the defendant and seemed to base the judgment on the principle that the standards binding on both parties are those of the ordinary reasonable man. Although the defendant company had taken a number of steps to abate the nuisance, the court found that an actionable nuisance existed and granted an injunction restraining the defendant from carrying 237 Id. 176. 238 [1955] V.L.R. 332. 239 Id. 335. 240 257 N.E. 2d. 870. 241 The defendant's investment in the plant was in excess of $45,000,000. 242 Boomer, supra, note 240 (this chapter) at pp. 872-873. 243 [1961] 1 W.L.R. 683. on the activities which caused the nuisance. Although in both cases the court held that a nuisance existed, in the English case the court by granting an injunction prevented the recurrence of the nuisance. These two cases illustrate the subjective approach adopted by the judiciary in nuisance disputes. A general principle cannot be culled from these decisions.",

Burt C.J. in the course of his judgment referred to the Noise Abatement Act of 1972 which attempts to prescribe noise levels which if exceeded, constitutes an offence, and held that on the evidence of the plaintiffs the latter had made good the claim in nuisance. 246 Although the judgment is clearly based on the rationale in Walter v.

For instance, in Painter v. Reed, 248 in determining whether the noises caused in the early morning by the movement and stamping of horses which disturbed the sleep of the plaintiff constituted an actionable nuisance and should be restrained by injunction, Richards J. considered carefully the locality in which the alleged nuisance occurred. His Honour was of the opinion that although the defendant's business was situated in a very suitable place in the city, yet the noise complained of was not as reasonable as the law would require. In Dunstan v. King, 249 in coming to the conclusion that the noise amounted to an actionable nuisance, the court considered the type of locality in question. Although it was adduced in evidence that there were other sawmills in the district, the court held that there was no other industrial undertaking within reasonable distance of the particular locality, which had the character of a quiet countryside. 250 considering whether the noise complained of was characteristic of the particular neighbourhood, Sholl J. held that it was not so. 252 In another case 253 the defendant was a haulage contractor and the noise and the dust caused by his business constituted a substantial nuisance to the plaintiff. The court cited a great deal of judicial authority in this area of the law. After considering the pecuniary loss resulting to the defendant if the court granted a permanent injunction, the fact that no one else living in the neighbourhood supported the plaintiff and the fact that the plaintiff had a motive for complaining about the noise (there was ill-feeling between the two families) the court came to the conclusion that in a residential suburb a man is not at liberty habitually to start a noisy motor vehicle at very early hours of the morning when his neighbours are usually asleep. Upon the defendant undertaking to abate the nuisance, the action was dismissed. This case underscores the preoccupation of judges in considering the locality of the alleged nuisance important, even in circumstances where there is evidence in favour of the defendant.",

Peacock held that instances of special circumstances would be extreme hardship, where the effect of granting an injunction would be to order someone to perform an impossibility or to abstain from doing something which is impossible for him not to do. The Supreme Court overruled the decision of the lower court which failed to grant an injunction to restrain the defendant's drunken behaviour which prevented the plaintiffs from the reasonable enjoyment of their home. The lower court seemed to have considered the facts that the offensive behaviour occurred only when the defendant was drunk and the admission of the defendant that he was an alcoholic sufficed as special circumstances for an injunction not to be granted. 281 The reasoning of the lower court was based on the premise that it was futile to issue an injunction against an offender who cannot control the commission of the offence, being in a perpetual state of intoxication. It is apparent that these were not special circumstances within the rule mentioned above. Special circumstances could be interpreted by different judges in different ways as the above case illustrates.",

Love 282 determined by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia. Disapproving of the expression \"moral certainty\" used in an earlier case 283 to describe what the plaintiff must prove, as suggesting a criminal onus of proof, the court held that there is no third onus of proof required in quia timet injunctions, lying between the civil and criminal onus. It was held by the Full Court that the plaintiff must prove that there is a real probability that the defendants' activities would cause a nuisance. 284 Citing academic authority in support of their view, 285 the judges held that in determining the real probability of the alleged nuisance, the relevant circumstances of the case should be taken into account, to determine whether the issuance of the injunction would be unfair to either party to the action. 286 For example, in Grasso v. Love on an appeal against the granting of an injunction against the construction of a drive-in cinema, the appellants argued mainly on the grounds that evidential facts were insufficiently considered in the court of first instance which resulted in a permanent injunction against them. held on appeal that although the issuance of the injunction was justified to the extent that substantial damage would have been caused to the respondents who resided in a portion of the land had the injunction not been issued, it need not have applied to the entire land as there was insufficient evidence to show that the proposed drive-in cinema would have caused a nuisance to the respondents had it been erected on a portion of the land a considerable distance away from the respondents' home. Therefore, the Supreme Court considered the rights of both parties in reaching their decision. However it could be argued that \"relevant circumstances\" is a purely subjective phrase and is dependent on the interpretation given to it by courts.",

Although it could be stated that diversity in judicial opinion leads to independence in judicial thinking and that judges should not be hampered by a comprehensive definition, yet a strong argument against this type of attitude is that the law would be ambivalent when there is a multitude of judicial opinions on one point, out of which no general principle could be culled.

WMA states further that the stress caused by noise on humans places, an increased burden on the body leading to higher energy consumption and greater wear. WMA suspects that noise can primarily favour diseases in which stress plays a contributory role, such as cardiovascular diseases, which can then be manifested in the form of hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or even apoplexy, not to mention in the psychosocial aspects of human life.

Sen further states that this misconception can be rejected on two counts, the first being that the value of the environment does not lie in its existing state but in the opportunities it offers humankind, and the second being that it is not sufficient to ensure that the environment is passively preserved by us but there needs to be active initiatives in educating the populace of the world on the environment and the benefits that would accrue to it by our actions such as reducing the population of the world and creating employment opportunities. In this context, education is a paramount factor that would make us more environmentally conscious. I would add a third factor to Sen's au fait treatise, that economic instruments which are brought to bear with a view to reducing pollution, particularly in the context of global warming, would be essential to meet the reality that, no matter what we might do to avoid interference with the environment by our enforced inactivity, the growth of world trade would force us to impose economic measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

The Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s international review carried out in 2001 and its Third Assessment Report (TAR) which followed did not alter this benchmark, although the TAR indicated increased expected realized warming by the year 2100. Policy was established on the issue of climate change and global warming at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit when 150 States Parties agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Although the UNFCC did not set hard targets for emissions, there were two following implementing conferences in Berlin and Kyoto in 1995 and 1997 respectively. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol set quantitative emissions ceilings for developed nations while abstaining from setting such ceilings for developing nations. By March 2001, 84 nations had signed the Kyoto Protocol (with the notable exception of the United States) and by November 2003, 120 states had ratified the Protocol. The United States policy in refusing to accede to the Protocol, conveyed by President Bush's refusal to sign the Protocol in 2001, has been based on the argument that scientific reasoning that led to the Kyoto Protocol was uncertain and implementation of the Protocol's policy would be too expensive. Another reason was that the United States strongly believes that there must be commitments by developing countries towards achieving emissions ceilings. In early December 2003, Russian President Putin also indicated that he did not intend to make Russia a party to the Protocol. The policy of the European Union toward the Kyoto Protocol was initially enthusiastic, where the EU stated in October 1990 that it would control and constrain emissions in 2000 to be consistent with 1990 levels. However, in 1992 the EU indicated that its carbon tax policy will be enforced toward the above end only if all OECD States (including United States and Japan) ratified the Protocol.",

The underlying recognition by the global community is that comparably expensive measures may have to be taken at the present time to ensure sustainability of a stable climate in the future. A known factor in this equation is that it takes at least three decades for the impact of emissions to be felt, due to ocean thermal lag and, perhaps more importantly, due to the fact that emissions are recurrent annually over a span of centuries owing to the pervasive residues of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for long periods of time.",

This philosophy is fundamentally flawed if one were to take into consideration the increasing gaseous emission levels from the developing countries which could seriously endanger global abatement. Another perceived inadequacy of the Kyoto Protocol is its inability to sustain consistency between its provisions on emissions trading which violates the least-cost solution of cutting emissions aimed at equating the marginal cost of cutbacks across all countries.",

Therefore, no one would doubt that mitigating the adverse effects of climate change is a costly business. It is here that the deficit of judgment occurs, where the main focus seems to be on the generation of revenue as compensation for pollution. Any such revenue collected should be based firstly on external factors such as trading on the quantity of emissions rather than internally on the quantity of consumables such as fossil fuels. Secondly, the revenue collected should be used on modernizing technology rather than on buttressing national coffers. Greener machines and engines should be developed that would lesson global engine emissions, and resources should be pumped into developing the necessary technology for the manufacture of such equipment. More sophistication is needed in the design of industry components towards this goal.",

However, one must take in to consideration the fact that a multilateral treaty at public international law would entail State responsibility. Would such a treaty enforce penalties on States after their obligations are breached? This would be counter-productive from an environmental sense. What solution would there be after a species or ecosystem is lost? Could State responsibility be enforced in complex situations affecting global warming? Would restitution or compensation work in instances of environmental damage? How would States be held responsible for emissions of private entities? Perhaps Professor Ian Brownlie, who takes the example of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 offers some food for thought: \"Chernobyl and its aftermath casts doubts on the efficacy of the approach to environmental disasters by way of State responsibility. States clearly did not regard the legal approach as being especially relevant. The State responsibility, or liability approach is about allocation of losses and reparation. It is thus retrospective. In the case of the protection of the environment it is prospective and prevention action is called for\". 300 Have we got the whole equation upside down?",

An Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change Report, on Aviation and Climate Change (IPCC) released in 1999 states that aircraft emissions were calculated to have increased NO x at cruise altitudes in northern mid-latitudes by approximately 20 %. The uncertainty in this calculation is primarily related to uncertainties in the NO x chemical lifetime and in the relative magnitude of the aircraft source compared to lightning, rapid vertical convection of surface NO x , and other sources of upper tropospheric NO x . The calculated increase was substantially smaller than the observed variability in NO x . NO x emissions from aircraft were calculated to have increased ozone by about 6 % in the region 30-60 N latitude and 9-13 km altitude. Calculated total ozone column changes in this latitude range are approximately 0.4 %. Calculated effects are substantially smaller outside this region. Some of the uncertainty in these calculations is captured by the range of model results. However, the models were notably deficient in coupling representations of stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry and in describing exhaust plume processes, HO x sources, and non-methane chemistry in the upper troposphere. In addition, there was high uncertainty associated with the model description of vertical and horizontal transport in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere.
