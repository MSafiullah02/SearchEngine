Studies have indicated that continuous amino acid substitutions occur during the circulation of the H7N9 virus.6 The gene tuning may create opportunities for further adaptation and its potential to cause a pandemic.6 Biological features showed that the virus can bind to both avian-type (a2,3-linked sialic acid) and human-type (a2,6-linked sialic acid) receptors.7 A ferret model showed that the virus was efficiently transmitted through direct contact, but less efficiently by airborne exposure.8 However, an individual study showed that an individual virus isolated from humans was highly transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplet,9 and a mouse model indicated that only the human H7N9 isolates were highly pathogenic in mice.9 Hence, investigation of clusters of human H7N9 infection is critically important to understanding potential person-to-person transmission and monitoring for any changes in the fitness of viruses to infect humans.",

In this report, we identified a hospital cluster of H7N9 avian influenza infection in the fifth wave epidemic in the Anhui Province of China. In the cluster, a woman (case A) with COPD was infected by H7N9 virus when she shared a hospital room with an H7N9-infected patient (index case). Her hospital bed was close to the index case's bed in around 2 m without any PPE. The woman had no exposure history to poultry at least 2 weeks before illness onset. Epidemiology investigation suggested no H7N9 circulation in poultry close to her living place, and she had no direct contact with the index case. The genomic sequence showed that the virus isolated from sputum of the infected woman shared 100% identity with the virus isolated from throat swab of the index case. So it is the most possible that case A was infected by H7N9 virus through airborne transmission. During 2013\u20132017, total 14 H7N9 sary infections were reported with probable human-to-human transmission while were linked 4 to household exposures and 10 to exposures in healthcare settings.12 However, there is no report of a confirmed hospital cluster of H7N9 infection except a possible or controversial hospital cluster in 2016.13, 14, 15 This report confirmed that the virus infected case A through airborne transmission possibly in a shared hospital room. It suggested that early diagnosis as well as clinical isolation treatment is necessary for H7N9 patients, and rigorous use of PPE is necessary for close contacts as well.",

The rapid deterioration of the disease may be due to her coexisting COPD because coexisting medical condition was the only independent risk factor for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.10 Delayed antiviral therapy may be associated with a long duration of illness (35 days) in the index case as suggested in published documents.25, 26\n",

According to the surveillance guidelines of pneumonia with unknown reasons, respiratory specimens were collected and sent to the local laboratories of the surveillance network to identify the possible causative pathogens.
