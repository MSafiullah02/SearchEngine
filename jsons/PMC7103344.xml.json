The disease is characterized by an atypical severe pulmonary disease with high lethality rate (Chan-Yeung, 2004, Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003, Chan-Yeung et al., 2003, Ho et al., 2003). Within few months after the first outbreak reported in the Guangdong province of China, the SARS-CoV rapidly spread out via international travelers and became a serious problem of public health worldwide. To date several isolated SARS-CoV infections are still occurring mainly in Asia (Peiris et al., 2004) although the major outbreak has been contained since 2003. This indicates that the SARS-CoV infection still represents a threat for the public health. In the absence of an effective therapy against SARS, the development of an effective vaccine is still needed.",

The spike S protein binds to members of the DC-SIGN family and to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Jeffers et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2004), thereby mediating the entry of the virus into the target cells.

Cellular components of the exosomes such as heat shock proteins were reported to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of exosome-based cancer vaccines (Chen et al., 2006). We therefore analyzed, whether the exosomal vaccine approach could also be exploited for the development of vaccines against enveloped viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus. To incorporate the S protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-S) into exosomes the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SARS-S were replaced by those of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. This chimeric protein (SGTM) was efficiently expressed on the cell surface, allowed entry of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, and was incorporated into exosomes. SGTM-containing exosomes were tested for their immunogenicity in mouse models as a novel protein vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Given the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G (Marsac et al., 2002, Kuate et al., 2006), we also explored the immunogenicity of exosomes generated from cells coexpressing SARS-S and VSV-G.",

The results of immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2A) of transfected 293T cells with a SARS-convalescent serum indeed suggest such a localization for Swt and SGTM. To further confirm cell surface expression, 293T cells transfected with S expression plasmids were stained with a SARS-convalescent serum without disrupting the cellular membrane. As shown in Fig. 2B the wild type as well as the hybrid S proteins were expressed on the cell surface. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells expressing SGTM was higher compared to that of cells expressing Swt (Fig. 2B). To further compare expression levels of SGTM and Swt on the surface of the cell, surface proteins of transfected cells were biotinylated, lysed and precipitated by avidin-coupled beads. Western blot analysis of the precipitates revealed efficient expression of SGTM but not Swt on the surface of the cell (Fig. 2C, right panel). Both proteins could be detected in total cell lysates (Fig. 2C, left panel). These results indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VSV-G mediate more efficient transport of the S protein ectodomain to the cell membrane than the homologous domains.",

In addition, it could be beneficial if receptor induced conformational changes of the hybrid S protein also mimic those of the parental S protein. To test whether the SGTM protein is functionally active, SIV, HIV, and MLV-based vectors were pseudotyped with either the wild-type or the hybrid S protein. Vector titers were determined on ACE2-transfected 293T cells, which were more susceptible for vector transduction than VeroE6 cells (data not shown). Infectious SIV, HIV and MLV vectors were obtained using the hybrid S protein (SGTM). Titers in the absence of a viral surface protein were below 5 GFU/ml. Incorporation of SGTM into vector particles (Fig. 3A) seemed to correlate with the titers obtained for SIV, HIV-1, or MLV vectors (Fig. 3B), while similar titers were obtained for all three vectors after pseudotyping with VSV-G. Vector titers of SGTM pseudotypes were only 1.5- to 2.7-fold higher than those obtained by pseudotyping with Swt, although the latter could hardly be detected in the particle preparations.",

In addition to these expected proteins, the Western blot analysis with the anti-CD82 antibody revealed incorporation of an unknown protein with a molecular weight of about 85 kDa. In contrast, HSP90, CD82, and the CD82 related protein were not detectable in blots of samples from pSwt- or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A).

The serum-free conditioned media were harvested and the exosomes were partially purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. Since we previously observed that incorporation of VSV-G into immunodeficiency virus-like particles enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag (Kuate et al., 2006), we also coexpressed VSV-G and SGTM in 293T cells and purified the released exosomes by ultracentrifugation. Both exosome preparations contained similar amounts of SGTM (Fig. 4C, left panel). The preparation of exosomes from cells coexpressing VSV-G and SARS-S (G + SGTM) contained both proteins (Fig 4C, right panel). In this Western blot analysis, both proteins were detected using an antibody recognizing the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G. The ratio of the band intensities of the SGTM and VSV-G proteins therefore indicates that in the vaccine preparation VSV-G is present at molar excess (Fig. 4C, right panel). These exosome-based vaccines were compared to an adenoviral vector expressing SGTM, since adenoviral vector vaccines were shown to induce strong immune responses to a broad spectrum of antigens encoded by the adenoviral vector. The adenoviral SGTM vector was constructed using a modified pAd-Easy system (He et al., 1998, Kuate et al., 2004). The adenoviral vector was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and expression of SGTM was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We also explored a prime\u2013boost regimen of priming with the exosomal vaccine and boosting with the adenoviral vector vaccine.",

Fusing heterologous proteins to membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of VSV-G targeted the heterologous protein to the cell surface and allowed efficient incorporation into viral vector particles (Owens and Rose, 1993, Jin and Wright, 2003). This was now also observed for the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-S. The SGTM fusion protein was expressed at higher levels at the cell surface compared to the wild-type protein. In comparison to SGTM, incorporation of wild-type S into viral particles was severely reduced. SGTM was not only incorporated into viral particles but was also functionally active as it allowed transduction of ACE2-expressing cells with pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors. This indicates that SARS-S-mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane is not disturbed by the heterologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and suggests that neutralizing epitopes of SARS-S are maintained in SGTM.",

Although exosomes are constitutively secreted from several cell types as a consequence of fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane (Schartz et al., 2002), the lack of detection of these proteins in Swt or mock-derived vesicles suggests that SGTM either induces exosome formation or enhances incorporation of HSP90 and CD82 into the exosomes.

In this respect, they mirror virosomal vaccines that are made by reconstitution of purified viral membrane proteins into liposomes. They differ from virosomal vaccines by the fact that exosomes do not only contain the viral protein, but also a wide array of cellular proteins, some of which have been shown to support induction of immune responses. Although exosomal vaccines have been primarily raised interest due to the fact that they allow cross presentation leading to the induction of CD8+ T cell responses, the multimeric presentation of viral surface proteins in their natural confirmation might also efficiently trigger viral surface protein-specific B cell receptors, particularly if cellular components of the exosome provide additional stimulatory signals. Since this could also favor the induction of neutralizing antibodies, we explored the potential of SGTM-containing exosomes as a novel vaccine approach against SARS coronavirus infections. Two injections of SGTM-containing xenogenic exosomes without adjuvants were sufficient to induce neutralizing antibody titers. After priming with the SARS-S exosomal vaccine and boosting with an adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those of a SARS-convalescent patient serum (Fig. 5C). In previous immunization studies using soluble S proteins, several immunizations in the presence of adjuvant were necessary to generate reasonable neutralizing antibody titers (Keng et al., 2005).",

This indicates that the fusion activity of VSV-G is required for its immunostimulatory properties and suggests that VSV-G-mediated shuttling of VLP-associated antigens into particular cellular compartments can dramatically enhance humoral immune responses. However, incorporation of VSV-G into SGTM-containing exosomes did not lead to a significant increase in binding or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-S. Since SGTM itself is fusion-competent, the enhancing effect of fusion-competent VSV-G might be masked. Alternatively, the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G might differ depending on the type of co-administered antigen. After fusion of the exosomal membrane with the endosomal membrane, the large ectodomain of the membrane anchored SGTM should be in the lumen of the endosome, while HIV-1 capsid proteins localized within the VLP should reach the cytoplasm. Although VSV-G and SGTM contain the same cytoplasmic domain directing intracellular trafficking we cannot formally exclude the possibility that VSV-G and SGTM are localized on different exosomes, which might also explain the poor enhancing effect of VSV-G on SARS-S antibody titers.",

A single injection of the SGTM-expressing adenoviral vector induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the growth of SARS-S-expressing tumor cells confirming the immunogenicity of adenoviral vector vaccines. Whether the release of SGTM-containing exosomes in vivo contributes to the strong immune responses observed remains to be determined. Immune responses to the adenoviral vector particle limit repeated application of adenoviral vector vaccines (Bangari and Mittal, 2006, Barouch et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2003). We therefore used a prime\u2013boost regimen consisting of SGTM-containing exosomes followed by the adenoviral vector boost.
