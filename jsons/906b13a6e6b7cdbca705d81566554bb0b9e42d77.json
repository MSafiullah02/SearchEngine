Despite strenuous efforts to contain the virus, it quickly turned into a pandemic that has swept through all continents except Antarctica. With an exponentially increasing number of patients being diagnosed, COVID-19 heavily strains our health care system and resources. In response to the escalating pandemic of the COVID-19, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that all nonessential planned surgeries and procedures be postponed until further notice.",

Inpatients with suspected COVID-19 should be treated as a confirmed case for neurosurgical bedside procedures. Each patient should be placed separately in a negative-pressure isolation room. Only essential health care personnel should be allowed to treat patients with COVID-19 to minimize medical trainees or students' exposure to the virus. A properly fitted N95 or higher respirator must be used. All health care personnel should undergo respirator fit testing before participating in the patient's care.

The preoperative holding area and the postanesthesia care unit should be bypassed if an isolation room is not available in these areas to limit potential contamination of these units. When obtaining consent, telecommunication is strongly recommended. If the patient is to return to the designated intensive care unit or medical ward directly, extubation and postoperative recovery should be allowed in the OR to further minimize the number of staff members directly exposed to the patient's airway. The patient care team should be prepared with enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for possible immediate medical intervention and avoid procedures performed with inadequate protection. Wearing a minimum of 2 sets of gloves is recommended during perioperative care and patient transit.",

Hand washing is performed with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds. Shoe covers and nonsterile inner gloves are obtained. A gown is worn that covers the entirety of arms, legs, head, and trunk (coverall gown). Then, a properly fitting N95 or higher respirator is used.

A nasopharyngeal swab sample was sent for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction Q6 testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus. CT angiography of the head (Figure 2B and C) and thoracic CT were obtained, with all health care personnel in enhanced PPE. CT angiography of the head revealed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Thoracic CT showed bilateral lower lobe inflammatory changes and suspected right upperlobe exudative change ( Figure 3A) . Definitive aneurysm repair procedure was deemed necessary and urgent by the neurosurgery team; the COVID-19 emergency surgery protocol was then activated. A negative-pressure OR was requested, and the anesthesiology team was informed of the situation and the planned surgical treatment. An isolation room was reserved for the patient for immediate postoperative care. The patient was transitioned to the OR through the designated route. All participating health care personnel was wearing enhanced PPE, as mentioned previously (Figure 4) . The patient underwent a modified pterional craniotomy for hematoma evacuation with anterior communicating artery aneurysm clipping, and placement of intracranial pressure monitor.",

However, due to the high false-negative rate (30%) of the testing and the patient's symptoms and CT findings, a decision was made by the COVID-19 task force to treat the patient as a patient under investigation for 14 days. The patient did well and eventually was discharged home at 14 days postoperatively with intact neurologic function. Two-month postoperative CT of the head ( Figure 2D ) was obtained, which showed resolved hematoma, stable aneurysm clip, and no hydrocephalus. A thoracic CT also was obtained and showed improvement from previous hospital admission images ( Figure 3B ).",
