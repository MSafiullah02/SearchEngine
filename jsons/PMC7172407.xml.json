Despite the popularity and economic importance of poultry as a food source, relatively little is known about the viral component of their gut microbiome and its source. Because the bacterial microbiota and the phage/DNA viral component of the microbiome are interdependent (Qu et al., 2008), the application of \u2018viral metagenomics\u2019 approaches that address DNA viruses has been the next step in assessing gut microbial communities (Breitbart et al., 2003, Cheval et al., 2011). But, in addition to DNA viruses, the poultry gut also harbors a complex consortium of eukaryotic or RNA viruses (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008) which have been associated with a host of enteric disease syndromes (Jindal et al., 2010). Enteric disease in poultry species often involves diarrhea and more progressive forms, such as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), poult enteritis complex (PEC), runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS) and several unclassified enteric diseases (Guy, 1998, Day and Zsak, 2013) result in high mortality. Not only do severe forms result in economic loss, but mild cases of enteritis and those that only affect a few birds in a flock do as well (Skinner et al., 2010). Although a number of different RNA viruses such as avian reoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses and coronaviruses, have been isolated from the intestinal contents of clinically ill birds (Reynolds et al., 1987b), the precise causative agent(s) of enteric disease are not known because knowledge of the composition of the eukaryotic or RNA viral community of the healthy poultry gut is rather limited making it difficult to distinguish between the \u2018core\u2019 and the \u2018transient\u2019 members and to thus identify causes of enteritis.",

In this study, our strategy was to examine the intestinal RNA viral flora of a clinically normal turkey, in order to aid in identifying RNA viral enteric pathogens accurately. However, eukaryotic viruses are a small component of the whole gut microbiome and sequencing RNA viruses from any niche has its own set of hurdles to overcome including the overabundance of the contaminating non-viral nucleic acids, lack of a universal phylogenetic marker and labor intensive viral purification methods involving \u2018density gradients\u2019. There have been several viral metagenomic studies reported to date, characterizing DNA (Breitbart et al., 2003, Angly et al., 2006, Thurber et al., 2009, Minot et al., 2013) or RNA viruses (Culley et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2006, Day et al., 2010) from various parts of the gastrointestinal system and environmental niches. Based on the sample type, these studies have used different protocols to recover viral particles and different sequencing platforms. Variations in the (a) methods to concentrate and purify viral particles, (b) library preparation protocols, and (c) sequencing platforms, have been reported to impact the DNA viral metagenome results (Hurwitz et al., 2013, Solonenko and Sullivan, 2013). We used the conceptual frameworks of these studies to design and test three different modified protocols with the potential to be used with large sample numbers for processing intestinal tissue and its contents to recover viral particles, while keeping the other parameters such as RNA extraction, library preparation and the sequencing platform exactly the same. In the first part of this study, the same sample was used to compare three tissue processing protocols for viral recovery and viral species richness as determined with an Illumina Miseq sequencing platform. The second part of this study explores modified bioinformatics approaches to analyze the resultant sequence data and gives a snapshot of the viral species richness and diversity present in a clinically normal turkey gut.",

            "text": "A modified approach was used to blast the sequences and reconcile the outputs from the paired ends for the re-sequenced dataset (Turkey_reseq) including the removal of duplicate fragments. To do this, paired reads were concatenated and one copy of each fragment was retained. The joined fragments were split to regenerate the forward (split R1) and reverse (split R2) reads. The paired reads were blasted independently against the NT database using the program's default parameters. The blast hits with bit scores below 35 were removed. For the remaining blast hits, the NCBI taxonomic ID associated with the sequence was determined and hits without taxonomy IDs were excluded. In order to keep the most robust hits, the blast results were independently grouped by their query IDs for each paired end and the hits with bit scores less than 90% of the highest bit score for the group were discarded. Lastly, all non-viral hits were filtered from the blast results. To reconcile the information from the paired ends F was defined as a sequenced DNA fragment, A as the non-unique set of taxon IDs associated with F's R1 read and B as the non-unique set of taxon IDs associated with F's R2 read. Using these definitions, the taxon IDs for the paired ends were reconciled into a single non-unique set of taxon IDs, O, for the F fragment according to the following rules: (a) if A = \u00d8 or B = \u00d8 then O = A \u222a B and (b) A \u2260 \u00d8 and B \u2260 \u00d8 then O = A \u2229 B. Our set notation is non-standard in that all sets are non-unique, allowing multiple occurrences of the same taxon ID. As a result, the union and intersection operators are additive with respect to the number of occurrences of a given taxon ID. This reconciled output was used for additional processing i.e. distribution of weight to leaf nodes and pruning the leaf nodes with weight lower than cutoff as described in Section 2.5.1 before MEGAN was used to visualize the taxonomic weights.",

However, most sequences had multiple taxon IDs that mapped to different levels of the tree. To impose a degree of order to the tree weightings, all sequences were forced to map to leaf taxons rather than nodes farther up the tree. If each sequence fragment is considered to provide evidence of a weight of 1, the weight of non-leaf nodes was divided among multiple leaf nodes in a two-step process. First, the weight was divided evenly to all taxonomic nodes associated with a fragment. Secondly, that weight was distributed evenly among all leaf nodes below it. The taxonomic diversity and distinctness indices were calculated as described by Clarke and Warwick (Pienkowski et al., 1998, Warwick and Clarke, 1995) with the modification that \u2018N\u2019, the number of nodes, was fixed to the number of leaf nodes in the viral domain (213,392) rather than the number of leaf nodes with weight. To provide a consistent sequencing depth for comparison between samples, five subsets of 100,000 reconciled fragments were selected by random sampling. These subsets (roughly 10% of the full dataset) were used to evaluate the effect of even weight distribution on diversity.",

Results revealed that approximately 85% of the sequences had hits to RNA viruses and approximately 15% of the sequences had hits to DNA and other viruses (Fig. 5\n). Among the RNA viruses, the dsRNA viruses and the ssRNA positive-strand viruses were found in abundance (81% together) compared with ssRNA negative-strand viruses and Retro-transcribing viruses (4% together). When summarized to the family level, the dsRNA viruses, ssRNA positive strand viruses and Retroviruses had a dominant single family, Reoviridae (99.6%), Astroviridae (90.9%) and Retroviridae family (92.7%) respectively. Additional families detected in low abundance from the dsRNA viruses, Retroviruses and ssRNA positive strand viruses are shown in Fig. 6a, b and Table 5\nrespectively. Hits to ssRNA negative-strand viruses showed greater richness with viruses from the Bunyaviridae (34.0%), Paramyxoviridae (26.0%), Rhabdoviridae (17.3%) and Arenaviridae (10.3%) families being well represented. The additional families detected in low abundance are shown in Fig. 6c. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. These results were in agreement with the preliminary results of the second processing method in which viruses of the genera Astrovirus (Astroviridae family) and Rotavirus (Reoviridae family) were detected in abundance (Fig. 3b).",

This was likely due to the fact that DNase treatment was not incorporated before RNA extraction. Of the 85% of the reads with hits to RNA viruses, approximately 76% had hits to viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae. Of these families, viruses of genera Rotavirus and Astrovirus were present in abundance. Viruses belonging to these genera have been associated with enteric disease syndromes in many host species including turkeys (Koo et al., 2013, Reynolds et al., 1987a). In addition, recent studies have shown the widespread prevalence of these viruses in poultry flocks across various geographical locations with or without the clinical manifestations of disease (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008, Roussan et al., 2012). It is very likely that specific viruses from these genera are very closely related and minute differences in the genetic content alter their virulence or changes their ability to infect the host. It is also plausible that some of the species detected in this study are opportunistic pathogens and their population increases significantly in the gut in response to some perturbation, and for this reason, they are routinely isolated from the intestinal contents of birds with enteric disease. It is also possible that the turkey from which the tissue was collected would have developed enteric disease or had recently recovered from enteritis and because data from this study is a snapshot from one bird, it cannot be established if the viruses detected were core or transient members of the gut microbiota. Finally, one major limitation in assigning roles to these viruses is that the identification of the viruses from enteric disease samples has been traditionally done with molecular methods which do not have the species specific resolution. So, although the results from this study, are consistent with previous studies (Day et al., 2010) which showed the presence of viruses from Reoviridae, Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae in the turkey gut, for all of the stated reasons, the results do not clarify what these viruses are doing in the turkey gut and what role, if any, they play in causing disease.",
