This study aimed to describe the parameters of coagulation function of patients with COVID-19 and reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease. This study retrospectively analyzed 113patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taizhou Public Health Center. Clinical characteristics and indexes of coagulation function were collected. A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, a Nomogram was built and the predictive accuracy was evaluated through the calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated to assess the clinical value. The data showed that Fibrinogen, FAR, and D-dimer were higher in the severe patients, while PLTcount, Alb were much lower. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for disease progression. The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*10 9 /L, respectively. The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610-0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that potential risk decreased in patients with FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*10 9 /L.The model showed a good negative predictive value ].This study revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for severe illness and the severity of COVID-19 might be excluded when FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*10 9 /L.",

The mortality rate of COVID-19 in China is about 2.7%, higher than that of ordinary influenza [2] . Most of the patients were mild, but some patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and dysfunction of blood coagulation [3] . As it has indicated that activation of the coagulation system might be associated with a sustained inflammatory response in COVID-19 [4, 5] . Many studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had suggested that hyper coagulation and fibrinolysis can increase the risk of microthrombus formation and furthermore aggravate the risk of organ failure inflammation [6] . Despite the prevailing study, information on the early prediction of severe cases is still limited and more studies are needed. In this study, we compared the differences in the indexes of coagulation function and dynamic changes in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease.",

Clinical diagnosis and classifications were made according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0) [7] . According to the guideline, COVID-19 patients are classified into four categories: 1) Mild, mild symptoms and no pneumonia manifestation; 2) Typical, fever, or respiratory symptoms and imaging manifestation of pneumonia; 3) Severe, having any of the three conditions: respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u226530 beats/min; means oxygen saturation \u226493% in a resting state; arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration \u2264300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa); 4) Critical, having one of the three conditions: shock incidence; respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; admission to ICU with other organ function failure. The endpoint of this study was the occurrence of severe illness. The clinical outcomes were monitored until February 15, 2020. All patients were classified into either the severe or non-severe group, the severe group contained severe and critically severe patients, while the non-severe group included mild and moderate patients. On admission, all patients were classified as non-severe. We collected a total of 28 COVID-19 patients from February 5 to February 20 as an external validation group. The endpoint of follow-up was March 1, 2020.",

Considering the total number of severe cases (n = 22) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, four variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Cutoff points were identified following Youden's index of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the results of multivariate analysis, a Nomogram was established. The C-index, calibration, decision curve, and the clinical impact curve were used to verify the Nomogram. Kaplan-Meier analysis was drawn, and risk stratification was compared by the log-rank test. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) of hazard ratio(HR) were used as common measures to assess relative risk.

To our knowledge, the sample size was largest outside the Wuhan region and composite indexes of coagulation function were surveyed in our study. The most important finding was that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors to predict the development of severe illness in COVID-19. Patients with FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*10 9 /L were unlikely to develop into severe disease. The results of this study showed that numerous differences of indexes of coagulation function were detected between severe and non-severe patients. Severe patients suffered a higher level of Fibrinogen and D-dimer at the earliest stage and became more remarkable as the disease progressed. Previous studies had uncovered that markedly elevated D-dimer levels were common in death patients with COVID-19 [8, 9] . Similar to their results, we presumed that severe patients with COVID-19 had increased coagulation and fibrinolysis activity, marked by elevated D-dimer concentrations [10, 11] . Notably, one severe patients in our study was developed into critical disease 7 day after admission with a D-dimer level of 13.61 mg/L, which further validated our speculation.",

As the illness recovered, FAR returned to normal levels gradually. FAR has been widely used as an effective marker of inflammation and tend to elevated extremely among various conditions such as severe infection and malignant disorders [12] . We speculated that the increased level of FAR may be related to cytokine storms induced by virus invasion [4] .In this study, compared with non-severe cases, thrombocytopenia was detected in severe patients. As severe disease occurred, a rapid decrease of PLT count appeared simultaneously. Lippi, G [13] had revealed that low platelet count was associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Hyper activity of Fibrinolysis often lead to the increase of platelets consumption. Corticosteriods may further cause thrombocytopenia when they had been widely used in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients [14] . This two reasons mentioned above may explain the similar phenomenon we had observed.",
