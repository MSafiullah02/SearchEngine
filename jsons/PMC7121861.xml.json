In 1882, Robert Koch first isolated , stained with alkaline methylene blue and vesuvin and established its etiologic relationship with tuberculosis. Koch described that the same human or bovine type Mycobacterium may cause avian tuberculosis. Strauss and Gamaleia (1891) and Maffucci (1892) cited in Cobbett (1917) illustrated that the etiological Mycobacterium of avian tuberculosis was different from human or bovine type. Hinshaw (1933) and Ackermann et al. (1974) reported occurrence of tuberculosis in Amazon parrot (Amazona farinosa). Coyle et al. (1992) proposed a new Mycobacterial species (Mycobacterium genavense) isolated from human patients with AIDS. Simultaneously in 1993, Mycobacterium genavense was reported from pet birds in Europe (Hoop et al. 1993).",

Some are pathogenic for man and animals which grow slowly in artificial media in laboratory (slow growers) than the fast growers (M. smegmatis). Previously, slow growing was sub divided into three types based on their host specificity i.e. human type, bovine type and avian type. Recent classification reveals that slow growing Mycobacterium is composed of several species. The most common species are Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is comprised of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. caprae, M. microrti, M. africanum and M. canettii. MAC is composed of two major species\u2014M. avium and M. intracellulare. M. avium is subdivided into four subspecies (ssp.) i.e. ssp. avium (Maa), ssp. paratuberculosis (Map), ssp. silvaticum and recently added ssp. hominissuis. MAC is considered as \u2018atypical mycobacteria\u2019 and members of this group are highly resistant against environmental changes such as high and low temperatures, dryness, extreme pH and common disinfectants. There are total 28 serotypes of MAC and the serotypes 1\u20136, 8\u201311 and 21 belonged to M. avium ssp. avium.\n",

Fluorescent acid fast stain may be used for better detection. In post mortem specimens, cytoplasm of infected cells is laden with acid-fast organisms.\n\nGross and histopathology: Enlarged liver, thickened intestinal loop, increased opacity in endosteal bone in the humerus, tibia, ulna, femur in advanced cases is suggestive for tuberculosis. Presence of visible granuloma is not a constant feature although may be detected in lungs. In decomposed carcasses bone marrow is the best specimen. Histopathogical findings such as presence of acid-fast bacilli in inflammatory cells can also tentatively diagnose mycobacteriosis.\nIsolation of organism: This is considered as gold standard method for confirmatory diagnosis of . To isolate the organism, the tissue sample must be processed in proper way. Tissue samples are homogenized in pestle and mortar after keeping in the solution of hypochlorite (1:1000) for 4\u201316 h. It is decontaminated by the addition of acid (5% oxalic acid), alkali (2\u20134% sodium hydroxide) or detergent (0.375\u20130.75% hexadecylpyridiniumchloride, HPC). The acid or alkali mixture is neutralized, centrifuged and the sediment is used for culture. M. avium subsp. avium can be isolated in Dorset egg medium, Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ), Herrold\u2019s and Middlebrook\u2019s (7H10,7H11) medium containing pyruvate. Glycerol and \u2018 mycobactin\u2019 is also added as growth enhancer. Mycobactin extracted from the environmental Mycobacteria, acts as siderophore helping in acquisition of iron. Mycobactin is produced by all cultivable Mycobacteria except M. avium subsp. avium and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Incubation period is 8 week at 40 \u00b0C. Even it can grow at 42\u201343 \u00b0C. It produces smooth or rough type of colonies. In liquid culture a radiometric method using 14C labelled substrate can be used for rapid detection (BACTEC system).\nM. genavense isolation is difficult although can be done on special media with prolonged incubation for 2\u20139 months. Conventionally, after decontamination of the samples with 2(N) NaOH, the samples can be inoculated in Herrold\u2019s egg yolk medium with and without mycobactin J and Sula\u2019s liquid medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. The growth is periodically checked in every two weeks. The successful isolation of M. genavense from blue headed parrot (Pionus menstruus) was observed in Herrold\u2019s egg yolk medium without mycobactin J after 270 days of incubation. In specialized laboratories, newly developed liquid culture systems [manual mycobacteria growth indicator tube (M-MGIT), BACTEC system) are used for confirmatory isolation of M. genavense.\nImmunological/serological tests: Use of tuberculin test with purified protein derivative of M. avium subsp. avium correlates poorly with clinical disease in psittacine birds. ELISA was experimentally developed with M. fortuitum, M. vaccae, and M. avium antigens for detection of antibodies against M. avium subsp. avium in birds. However ELISA produces variable results in different species of birds. Immunological or serological tests for detection of mycobacteriosis in pet birds are not routinely followed.\nMolecular biology: Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) can detect from fresh samples, faeces and paraffin-blocked tissues. The species-specific PCR targets IS901 and hsp65 genes for detection of M. avium subsp. avium and M. genavense, respectively. Differentiation of both the species can be done by sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene. A nested polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) from the consensus sequences of the hsp65 gene, followed by analysis with restriction enzymes can also differentiate M. avium and M. genavense. Real-time TaqMan PCR assay is developed to detect hsp65 gene of M. genavense and MAC subsp. Other recent technologies such as GenoType assay and DNA microarrays can be used for diagnosis of avian tuberculosis. For detection of genetic diversity among the strains of M. avium subsp. avium, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units\u2014variable-number tandem-repeat markers (MIRU-VNTR) typing can be successfully used.\n",

The interaction between the T3SS proteins (SipA, SipC) with the actin cytoskeleton of the enterocytes causes cytoskeletal rearrangements to generate an uneven surface (membrane ruffle). The organisms are trapped within the ruffled membrane and are internalized by the enterocytes. Within the enterocytes, the bacteria reside in a membrane bound vacuole i.e. Salmonella containing vacuoles (SCV). As the SCV matures, it migrates from the luminal border of the enterocyte to the basal membrane. In the basal membrane, the SCV enter the macrophages associated with peyer\u2019s patches in the sub mucosal space. The SCV never fuses with lysosome within macrophages and thus avoid phago-lysosome fusion which is necessary to kill the bacteria. Additional factors such as SP-2-T3SS (SipC protein), SP-3 associated proteins also help in intracellular survival. The formation of induced fibrils (SIF) help in bacterial replication in an unknown way. It is evident that major portion of the infection is cleared by the macrophages, only certain part can survive leading to chronic infection or carrier state with persistent faecal shedding. Sometimes, invasion of Salmonella takes place beyond the intestine which causes bacterimia, survival and replication of the bacteria in reticulo-endothelial cells of liver and spleen.

Giemsa stain is more useful in the smears prepared from conjunctival scrapings. The inclusion bodies appear purple/blue with Giemsa, Castaneda and methylene blue stain and red with Macchiavello, Gim\u00e9nez, Stamp, and modified Z-N stains.\nIsolation of Chlamydia from clinical samples: Isolation of Chlamydia can be done in the yolk sacs of embryonated hen eggs, laboratory animals and cell culture. Fertile chicken eggs (6\u20138 days old) are inoculated through the yolk sac route. The embryo dying three or more days after incubation is examined for chlamydial inclusions. Mice are ideal laboratory animal for isolation of Chlamydia. The mice usually die within ten days of intranasal, intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation and the EBs can be isolated from viscera and peritoneal exudates. Cell lines treated with a metabolic inhibitor (cycloheximide at 2 \u03bcg/ml) can be used for isolation of Chlamydiae. McCoy, HeLa, monkey kidney cells, L-929, Buffalo Green Monkey (BGM) cells, mouse fibroblast cells, fish and lizard cells are used. The inoculated cells should be incubated at 35\u201337 \u00b0C for 48\u201372 h and the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are detected by staining ( Giemsa) or fluorescein conjugated monoclonal antibody. Isolation by cell culture is still considered as gold standard method for detection of Chlamydia. However, it requires biosafety level-3 (BSL3) laboratory with expertise.The clinical samples should be decontaminated by antibiotics like gentamicin (50 \u03bcg/ml), vancomycin (75 \u03bcg/ml) and nystatin (500 unit/ml) before inoculation into eggs, animals or cell lines. Transport medium (2SP) can be used as buffer.\nDetection of C. psittaci antigen: ELISA based antigen detection kits are available for detection of C. trachomatis infection in human. The same kit can be used for detection of C. psittaci because the two species share common antigen. However, minimum 600 elementary bodies are needed in the samples for detection.\nSerological tests: Serological tests can be used as supplementary diagnostic tests along with detection of antigen or isolation. Presence of antibodies in the host cannot confirm active infection. Sometimes, false negative results are produced if the samples are collected before development of antibody or during treatment with antibiotics. The serological methods such as micro immunofluorescence ( MIF) test, ELISA, CFT, elementary body agglutination (EBA) tests are used for detection of anti-Chlamydia antibodies. MIF is more sensitive and can detect all types of immunoglobulins in the sera. ELISA based tests using whole organism, LPS, lipoglycoprotein of Chlamydia as antigen are sensitive but less specific for detection of C. psittaci. Whereas, ELISA with recombinant major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C. psittaci as antigen, can more specifically detect C. psittaci. CFT can detect anti-Chlamydia Ig G only, not Ig M. Further, CFT is tedious, time consuming, less sensitive test and the antigens (complement fixing) are not commercially available. The EBA test can detect anti-Chlamydia Ig M only, and as a consequence, infection in early stage can only be diagnosed.\nMolecular biology: PCR is a specific, sensitive, and rapid technique to detect C. psittaci. Successful application of PCR depends on quality of extracted DNA from the clinical samples. Guanidine-detergent lysing solution should be used for lysis of eukaryotic host cells and Chlamydia for extraction of DNA. The 16S rRNA gene is conserved in the genus Chlamydia and is a suitable target gene for detection of Chlamydia up to species level. Major outer membrane protein (ompA) is used as a target gene in nested PCR, although, variations exist in the MOMP gene sequence among C. psittaci strains. SYBR green-based real time PCR targeting ompA, 23S rRNA gene, inclusion membrane protein A gene (incA), molecular cysteine-rich protein gene (envB) of C. psittaci and microarray-based detection assays are also developed for detection of Chlamydia.\n",

The bacteria can also be demonstrated by wet mounts of collected droppings by phase contrast or dark field microscopy. Darting motility of the organisms is suggestive for Campylobacter spp.\nIsolation of bacteria from clinical samples: The selective media for Campylobacter isolation is broadly categorized into two types: charcoal based and blood based. Charcoal and blood components remove toxic derivatives of oxygen from the media. Examples of selective media are: modified charcoal, cefoperazone, deoxycholate agar (mCCDA), Karmali agar or CSM (charcoal-selective medium), Preston agar, Skirrow agar, Butzler agar and Campy-cefex agar. Commonly used non-selective media for isolation of Campylobacter spp. are blood agar with or without 0.1% sodium thioglycolate and antimicrobials (cephalosporins, trimethoprim, polymyxin, vancomycin, bacitracin, actidione, colistin, nystatin). Optimum growth condition for thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni, C. coli) are 42 \u00b0C temperature for 24\u201348 h, pH 6.8, and 3\u20135% CO2 with 3\u201315% O2.\nC. jejuni produces non-haemolytic, finely granular, irregular margin, flat, greyish colonies.

During attachment of adult tick with large mammalian hosts, the multiplication of spirochete restarts and the number is increased. The expression of B. burgdorferi outer surface protein (osp) is also changed from ospA to ospC. The ospC helps in transmission of Borrelia from the mid gut to the salivary glands of ticks. Thus, B. burgdorferi is transmitted transstadially from larva to nymph and from nymph to adult. Rarely, within the tick population, B. burgdorferi is transmitted transovarially. When the adult ticks bite a new host, the spirochetes are transmitted from the salivary glands.

However, studies in animals (dogs), indicated that results of serological tests are inconclusive. The antibodies may be produced due to earlier exposure specially in those areas where infected tick bite is a common phenomenon. Such kind of serological studies are not conducted in birds probably due to this uncertainty.\nMolecular biology: The whole blood samples collected from the birds can be used for DNA extraction.

M. gallisepticum can be isolated in specialized medium supplemented with 10\u201315% heat-inactivated avian, swine or horse serum. Change in broth colour indicates positive growth after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 days. Serum plate agglutination test is the rapid serological test for detection of M. gallisepticum antibodies in birds, although, sometimes it produces false positive result due to cross reaction. PCR targeting 16SrRNA gene and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay based on a gene within the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdhA) are developed for rapid detection of M. gallisepticum.",

The viral genome is linear, negative sense single stranded RNA and it contains eight numbers of segments.

The kits are mostly intended for use in poultry, yet not validated in other species of birds.\nMolecular biology: Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), light upon extension PCR (LUX-PCR) and conventional reverse-transcriptase-PCR can be used for detection of H5 or H7 subtype of AIV. Although false negative results are obtained in cloacal swabs and faecal samples due to presence of PCR inhibitors. To avoid the high cost and expertise needed in PCR based techniques, isothermal techniques such as rapid isothermal nucleic acid detection assay (RIDA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) are used for detection of AIV. Further development in the diagnostic approach used proximity ligation assay (PLA) for detection of AIV in chicken, and DNA-microarray based technique for characterization of AIV in wild and domestic birds. In future, rapid isothermal nucleic acid detection assay-lateral flow (RIDA-LF) and immunoassay-based biosensors will be a better choice due to less dependence on instrumentation and rapid process of a good numbers of samples in less time, respectively.\n",

Sudden death without any symptom or mild symptom (feather dystrophy) occurs in per acute and acute forms, respectively. These forms are common in juvenile birds. In chronic form of the infection, weight loss, lethargy, anaemia, diarrhoea, shedding of developing feathers, abnormal development of new feathers is observed (Figs. 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16). Mostly, contour, tail and down feathers are lost symmetrically and they are replaced with dystrophic feathers that fail to grow. Deformities of beak and claws are not a constant feature. It depends on species of the bird and other predisposing factors. Cockatoos are more susceptible to beak and claw deformities than other psittacine birds. Beak elongation, transverse or longitudinal fractures, palatine necrosis are possible beak deformities observed (Fig. 2.17). Chronic infection is not always fatal, the birds may survive for several years. Sometimes death occurs due to secondary infection.\n\n\n\n",

The virus is confirmed by electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry.\nSerology: Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and blocking ELISA are developed for detection of Avian Circovirus antibodies. The serological tests cannot confirm the active BFDV infection as the antibodies might be present due to latent infection. Agglutination of red blood cells by BFDV varies with the source.

Conventional PCR targeting ORF C1 or ORF V1 section of the viral genome, nested-PCR, duplex shuttle PCR, and real-time PCR are developed for detection of BFDV.

Unlike mammals where immunity has a direct relation with occurrence of giardiasis, avian immunity rarely shows such association.

The oocysts are non-refractile, spherical (5\u20136 \u00b5m in diameter) in shape and are often confused with yeast cells. Gram\u2019s stain, Kinyoun acid-fast stains are used in light microscopy.

Phase contrast microscopy provides better resolution and the oocysts appear as bright bodies with 1\u20134 dark granules (granules are absent in yeast cells).Faecal samples can be concentrated by centrifugal flotation in high specific-gravity salt or sugar solutions (Sheather\u2019s sugar flotation technique, discontinuous density sucrose gradient) for detection of oocysts.

The enlarged liver, spleen and dilated intestinal loops can be palpated in few cases. During the period of parasitaemia, the protozoa A serini undergoes scizogony in the polymorphomononuclear cells (PMNs) and spread throughout the body circulation. Thereafter, the parasites reach out to their site of predilection reticuloendothelial cells (RE cells) of vital internal organs like liver, spleen, pancreas and intestinal epithelial cells. During this process of multiplication and propagation, the parasite causes heavy damage to these organs resulting in hepatospleenomegaly and enteritis in young birds.",

In birdseed agar the colonies appear as brown coloured in the center of the plate due to the production of melanin by the action of phenyl oxidase. The optimum capsule production is detected in chocolate agar after incubation at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 tension. The isolates are confirmed by API system or different biochemical tests such as urea hydrolysis, assimilation of inositol and creatinine, non-fermentation of carbohydrates, and melanin production. The L-Canavanine glycine bromothymol blue media can differentiate C. neoformans and C. gattii by the formation of distinctive blue coloration with the growth of C. gattii.\nDetection of Cryptococcal antigen: Detection of Cryptococcal antigen in clinical specimens can be performed by latex particles coated with polyclonal serum and antigen-capture ELISA. The detection of antigen is possible from both live and dead organisms. During initial phase of therapy, disintegration of the yeast cells releases the capsule which produces high titer. So, the tests should not be done within 6\u20138 weeks after initiation of the therapy. The titer can be observed even after successful treatment as the dead organisms also have the intact capsule.\nMolecular biology: Multiplex PCR and mating type-PCR are used for determination of molecular and mating types of C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. gattii isolates.\n",

Histopathological staining can be performed with periodic acid Schiff (PAS), Grocott\u2019s silver or methenamine silver stain for detection of tissue invasion. In the tissue section, hyphae are narrow and septate which are not easily distinguishable from other fungi (Fig. 2.53). Different species of Aspergillus has characteristic fruiting body structures which can be identified by an expert. Confirmation of aspergillosis is also possible by immunohistochemistry.\n\nIsolation of Aspergillus from clinical specimens: Aspergillus can be isolated in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) with or without chloramphenicol (0.05 gm/l) and other common bacteriological media such as blood agar. The cycloheximide can inhibit the growth. The plates are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4\u20135 days. A. fumigatus is thermophilic which is able to grow at 55 \u00b0C and can survive at more than 75 \u00b0C. However, repeated isolation from the clinical specimen is required, along with correlation with history, clinical signs, histopathological observations for proper diagnosis of clinical aspergillosis.\nBlood biochemical tests and radiography: Haematological parameters such as leukocytosis (20,000\u2013100,000), heterophilia with a left shift (degenerative shift), monocytosis, lymphopenia, and change in \u03b2-globulin concentration indicate about occurrence of infection such as aspergillosis. Radiographic changes of pneumonia and airsacculitis (lateral and ventrodorsal views) also suggests respiratory tract infection such as aspergillosis. Both these biochemical tests and radiogrpahy cannot confirm the infection.\nDetection of\nantigen: Detection of Aspergillus antigen is useful in acute infection. Galactomannan (GM) is the predominant antigen released by A. fumigatus in the circulation during angioinvasion which can be detected by latex agglutination test, sandwich ELISA in blood samples. The detection limit of both the tests is 15 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively. However, GM detection assay is not specific for Aspergillus as it is cross-reacting with other fungi such as Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Histoplasma. Similarly, \u03b2-D-glucan (BDG) can be detected for identification of Aspergillus. It is also produced by a lot of other fungi such as , Fusarium, Pneumocystis etc. So the test can predict the general fungal infection rather than specifically aspergillosis.\nSerological tests: Serological tests such as counter-immunoelectrophoresis, agar gel immunodiffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) can be employed as supportive diagnostic assays to detect the antibodies in chronic infection. In immunosuppressed birds production of antibody is undetectable.\nMolecular biology: Confirmation of spp. can be done by conventional PCR and real-time PCR from clinical samples. A. fumigatus isolates can be characterized by PCR-RFLP using BccI, MspI and Sau3AI restriction enzymes.\n",

Among the pet birds, clinical candidiasis is reported from peach-faced lovebirds, Fisher\u2019s lovebirds, pigeons, cockatiels, Amazon parakeets, budgerigars and peacocks. In Eclectus parrot, concomitant infection of histoplasmosis and candidiasis is detected. Healthy cockatiels and some other psittacines are also detected to act as carrier of Candida spp. Infected birds show whitish, pseudomembranous lesions in oral cavity, crop and esophagus. Crop is the most suitable organ for fungal growth due to its pouch like structure and availability of nutrients. General symptoms such as anorexia, depression, delayed crop emptying, and regurgitation is sometimes observed. Presence of thickened mucosa (pseudomembranes) and ulcers in oral cavity, esophagus and crop is the major necropsy findings. The smear prepared from the clinical specimens can be observed under microscope either by 10% KOH preparation or by staining with Gram\u2019s stain method. In the tissue section can be observed by PAS-haematoxylin or methenamine silver stain. They appear as unicellular budding yeast or hyphae and pseudohyphae (Fig. 2.54).

The infection is reported from captive-bred budgerigars (Melopsitticus undulatus), parrotlets (Forpus spp.), canaries (Serinus canaria), pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and gray partridges (Perdix perdix) as primary pathogen or concomitant with other infections. Faecal-oral route is the probable transmission route of Macrorhabdus infection in birds. The yeast prefers to colonize isthmus of proventriculus or ventriculus in birds. The infection is chronic and it produces certain non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, continuous loss of body weight, depression, plumage disorder, regurgitation, diarrhoea and dehydration (Fig. 2.55). Sudden death due to rupture of proventriculus is observed in budgerigars and parrots. Swollen and hyperemic proventriculus, covering of isthmus with thick, transparent-to-white mucus, and mucosal erosions in gizzard are specific necropsy findings. Fresh faecal samples from live birds and tissues from vital organs (esophagus, crop, proventriculus, gizzard, pancreas, liver etc.) can be collected in 10% buffered formalin after post-mortem. Smears prepared from faecal samples can be stained by Gram\u2019s method. The tissue sections are stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver nitrate (GMS) and Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin and eosin. Detection of typical gram-positive, large rod shaped organisms (20\u201360 \u00b5m long and 2\u20133 \u00b5m wide) suggests Macrorhabdus infection (Fig. 2.56). Isolation of is difficult because it does not grow in commonly used solid media. It can be isolated only in liquid medium (minimum essential media) with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% sucrose and more than two weeks incubation. Antifungals for instance nystatin and amphotericin-B can be used for the treatment (Figs. 2.57, 2.58 and 2.59).\n\n\n\n\n\n",
