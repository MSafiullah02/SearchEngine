Recipient outcome was compared with 1423 electively listed transplant recipients. Not surprisingly, death at any time after listing, including post-transplant death, was higher among urgently listed patients. These patients were younger (53 \u00b1 13 vs 55 \u00b1 12 years), had more ventilator and extracorporeal support (25% vs 2%), had more restrictive lung disease (73% vs 51%), and had a higher Lung Allocation Score (82 \u00b1 13 vs 47 \u00b1 17). Of note, at 1 month after listing, mortality was 26% in urgently listed patients and 58% received transplants versus only 2.1% and 20%, respectively, in the electively listed patients. However, in-hospital morbidity and mortality, survival up to 7 years, and allograft function were similar in a matched comparison of both groups with 76 patients each using weighted balancing\u2013score methodology.4\n",

A limitation of the study acknowledged by the authors is the unknown proportion of patients who were not referred or were not listed for LTx at all. Therefore, the results presented in this paper represent only a portion of well-selected patients believed to be still able to undergo transplantation with a reasonable outcome. Series on successful LTx in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, for example, after a serious viral infection, are rarely reported.5\n,\n6\n",

Young patients who survive the critical period in the intensive care unit and who can be rehabilitated may still be considered for elective transplantation in case their pulmonary function and exercise capacity remain limited without any other medical or surgical options for further improvement. As discussed in the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus document,2 these patients will need careful reevaluation to determine candidacy for LTx taking into account not only physiologic findings but also psychosocial factors, family support, and fully informed patient consent that cannot always be obtained upon referral when critically ill.",
