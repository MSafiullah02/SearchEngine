Even if effective countermeasures are available, a failure to completely contain a contagious disease may give rise to a far-reaching epidemic with considerable social disruption and economic impact. Both civilian and military homeland biodefense planners are thus faced with a broad spectrum of contagious disease threats and a sound conceptual framework is necessary to shape and plan threat responses. Arguably, well-designed epidemic modeling studies can contribute significantly to such a conceptual framework.",

First, modern pharmaceuticals could neither prevent SARS infections nor abort the natural course of SARS cases. Each affected country controlled the spread of SARS in traditional ways: (a) case identification and contact tracing, (b) case-patient isolation (hospital infection control), and (c) exposure management (quarantine). Second, disease surveillance shortcomings and public health capacity limitations constrained SARS responses of Asian governments. Asian public health systems were clearly under stress and international assistance may have been critical in avoiding much larger outbreaks. Third and last, a great deal of SARS epidemiological information has already been published and more SARS data is likely to appear in the scientific literature.",

Assuming an unstructured population and the standard incidence, disease transmission occurs by means of homogeneous mixing, where each contagious individual is free to contact and infect any susceptible individual. But if the population is structured according to cultural, socio-economic, demographic or geographic factors, there is a mixing matrix that constrains opportunities for disease-causing contacts. Proportionate and preferred mixing matrices have enhanced the explanatory and predictive powers of epidemic models since the late 1980s [6]. It is also true that sufficient data is seldom accessible to quantitatively define key mixing matrix elements for a large and highly structured population.",

This power law is associable with network evolution or growth. More specifically, in contrast to classical random graphs, a scale-free network is a growing open system that accommodates a new node by attaching it to certain preexisting network nodes. The growth process for a scale-free network gives rise to another distinguishing feature, correlated degrees of connected nodes [9].

They have mathematically defined important properties of scale-free networks and examined epidemiological implications of these properties using susceptible-infectious (SI), susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and SIR models. In their network-based SI, SIS and SIR analyses, Barthelemy and coauthors routinely assumed an unbounded total population and employed a uniform initial condition (forcing all node degree or connectivity classes to be initially infected at the same level); additionally, they concentrated on an epidemic\u2019s exponential growth phase. The principal finding of these analyses is that, once high connectivity classes become infected, a cascade of infection occurs and affects lower and lower connectivity classes over time. Lastly, with regard to a non-uniform initial condition, the investigators found that confining all initially infected individuals to a single high-connectivity class would lead to an outbreak involving a faster rise and a faster invasion of the network.",

Small and Tse [18] discuss their simulation of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and they make the following observations: (a) a small world network with long distance links can exhibit scale-free behavior and (b) further work must be done to ascertain whether their simulation results reveal that type of behavior.

Zoonotic infections and ordinary human activities in Asia may again be responsible for major SARS outbreaks, but it is also conceivable that a bioterrorist attack (for example, human vectors and intentional person-to-person SARS transmission) would cause even more human suffering and deaths.

In their study of SARS transmission and control in China, Zhou, Ma and Brauer assumed an inexhaustible supply of susceptible individuals, formulated a system of linear difference equations, and followed a process of trial and error in obtaining a time-varying transmission rate that enabled the model to closely match data on diagnosed cases per day [26]. A more complex model of the SARS outbreak in China was later put forward by Zhang, Lou, Ma and Wu [27]. These authors first quantified their \u2018basic adequate contact rate\u2019 using about three weeks of data on diagnosed SARS cases and then they obtained model results for the daily number of SARS patients (in good agreement with epidemiological data). Lastly, Gumel and co-authors studied a system of ordinary DEs with constant parameters and the chosen values of the two free parameters (transmission rates for contacts involving contagious individuals within and without hospital isolation) provided the \u2018best\u2019 agreement between calculated and reported cumulative SARS fatalities over time. After obtaining values of the two free parameters for four SARS outbreaks (Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing), calculations of cumulative probable cases over time generally conformed to reported data for each outbreak [28].",

If the size of the seeded connectivity class is relatively small, then the magnitude of the early spike is relatively large. Regarding the lower four graphs and a fixed location (j\nSEED\n = 3) of the initial infection, previously-considered values of \u03b5 engender four time histories of the new infection rate in each connectivity class. In the 3rd (100th) connectivity class, lower (higher) values of the combinative mixing parameter produce higher (lower) peak values of the new infection rate. These influences of the combinative mixing parameter are consistent with curves in the lower graph of Fig. 4.",

Alternatively, variations of parameters in Table 2 could be explored by utilizing either model with the appropriate previously-derived rate of disease transmission.

Fig. 7 thus implies that individuals in very high connectivity classes can become infected well before those individuals in somewhat lower connectivity classes. But the upper four graphs in Fig. 6 suggest that the first generation of follow-on infections emerges by D\n + 25.

After the first generation of follow-on infections, the upper half of Fig. 6 reveals remarkably similar exponential phases and general wave shapes for all four locations of the initial infection. And lastly, keeping the initial infection in the 3rd connectivity class, the lower half of Fig. 6 shows that different values of the combinative mixing parameter primarily affect magnitudes (rather than exponential phases) of new infection rates.

Whereas the basic epidemic model is efficient in assessing the general dynamical impacts of disease progression and outbreak control parameter variations, the network-based model provides insights into disease transmission within and between connectivity classes. Both models were designed to support the development and/or evaluation of biodefense scenarios, requirements and investment alternatives. It\u2019s also worth emphasizing that biodefense investment decisions must often be made years before the formulation and implementation of new outbreak control strategies.",

Perhaps more importantly, in establishing biodefense requirements and making biodefense investment decisions, retrospective questions (\u2018what would have happened if\u2026\u2019) deserve as much attention as questions about possible future events (\u2018what will happen if\u2026\u2019). Historical outbreaks are obviously tied to particular settings and epidemiological circumstances that may or may not appear again in future outbreaks. Nevertheless, sound analyses and interpretations of historical outbreak dynamics could play a stronger supporting role in the biodefense planning process.",

In reconstructing a primary pneumonic plague outbreak, for instance, log normal PDFs should be good choices for characterizing the progression of primary pneumonic plague infections and the insertion of these PDFs in the above models is an easy first step. On the other hand, determining a suitable scale-free contact network for primary pneumonic plague and getting enough data to evaluate the key parameters (Table 1, Table 2) could be more challenging tasks. It is interesting to note that the projection of respiratory droplets within a radius of 2 m or so is the main mechanism for transmitting both SARS and primary pneumonic plague from person to person. If the scale-free network in this paper is a reasonable vehicle for analyzing SARS transmission, then this same network might also be helpful in understanding primary pneumonic plague transmission.",
