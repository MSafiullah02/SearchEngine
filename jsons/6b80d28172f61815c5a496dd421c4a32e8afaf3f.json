In my view LIP is a lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas in this case there are the added components of histiocytic inflammation around alveoli, neutrophils in bronchioles, and a few small aggregates of histiocytes. These features all suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, even though eosinophils and distinct granulomatous inflammation are lacking. The clinical history is also consistent with either of the two proposed clinical interpretations, but more in keeping with the history of intermittent seasonal disease. Lymphocytic hyperplasia or inflammation (Giemsa stain) also can occur with autoimmune and collagen-vascular diseases, and I cannot exclude that interpretation, but the histiocytes favor hypersensitivity reaction. I generally do not use the term NSIP as an entity but rather as the process which has many attributes of UIP but is not diagnostic of same. The absence of significant scarring in this case excludes a firm diagnosis of UIP, and I would not make a diagnosis of NSIP in this case.",

Extrinsic allergic alveolitis including that associated with aspergillus is one form of hypersensitivity reaction. Other cases remain enigmatic and idiopathic.

However, an LIP-like change with edema has been seen in patients with hypersensitivity reaction. Another possibility is a slowly resolving unusual infection such as virus or mycoplasma or chlamydia. These agents might be further investigated by serologic or cultural studies. Collagen-vascular disease also can be considered because of the lymphoid hyperplasia and foci of chronic organizing pneumonia. I doubt toxic exposure. I am not sure whether or not the blood in the alveoli is real. Because of the extensive edema, some of it may represent leakage of capillaries.

Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis can be a condition which causes interstitial infiltrates on X-ray and pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale, it can be an incidental finding, or it can be a disease. To further substantiate the degree of capillary proliferation, I performed recut sections on a block of tissue in paraffin which you kindly provided and stained the recut sections with periodic-Schiff, elastic tissue, trichrome and Giemsa as well as prussian blue for iron. The periodic acid-Schiff stain, particularly, shows the excess number of capillaries. I then reviewed the chest radiograph which you provided.

Although some may be operative, blood in terminal bronchioles suggests active flow and consequently real hemorrhage. There are collections of neutrophils with fibrin in a few alveoli and in interstitium of the type sufficient for me to suspect that there are now and have been episodes of capillaritis. I cannot make that diagnosis unequivocally because the neutrophils are spotty, not particularly associated with the fresh hemorrhage, and not associated with detectable fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels or with fibrin thrombosis of capillaries. If one cannot prove capillaritis, the remaining diagnosis in this case would be IPH, but I believe the evidence for capillaritis is strong enough so that I suspect the bleeding is due to lupus erythematosis, WG, or one of the other less frequent causes of capillaritis.

Secondary arterial hypertension often develops in patients with veno-occlusive disease, but in this case there is only mild medial thickening of some arteries.

Very little elastica stains on your elastic tissue stains, although wavy refractile elastic-like fibers are present in arteries and pleura. I am not sure whether this stain is technically in error or whether the apparent elastic tissue is chemically abnormal. However, degenerate clumped elastic fibers are visible due to their iron encrustation on the iron stain. Abnormal elastic fibers are present on one side of an artery, and elastic fibers are absent on the opposite side of the artery. The focal areas of hemorrhage with punctate acute necrosis, some regions of organizing hemorrhage a few days old, and extensive hemosiderin (iron stain) and fibrosis indicative of hemorrhage weeks or months old suggest that the bleeding has been due to repetitive arterial destruction and rupture rather than nonspecific hemorrhage from a ruptured bulla. These changes have been described previously in pseudoxanthoma elasticum and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Various other clinical findings might substantiate or refute these diagnoses. Elastic tissue diseases have many subcategories. Therefore, I do not know whether this patient fits into any clearly described entity.

Multiple and enlarged nucleoli in some of the nuclei make one seriously consider carcinoma. However, the highly atypical cells are few in number when considering the totality of the case, and the nuclei preserve a relative regularity in size. The biopsy shows a focal ulceration which has been present for many days because there is fibrosis and capillary proliferation beneath it. Adjacent to this ulceration is squamous metaplasia with regeneration and highly atypical nuclei. The cytological features in the bronchial epithelium resemble those in the cytological preparation. Although I do not know that this particular site is the source of the highly atypical cells seen on the cytological preparations, the atypical cells in the washings are consistent with reactive epithelial cells such as might occur with ulceration.

The follicular lymphoid hyperplasia oriented around bronchioles can be described as follicular bronchiolitis. The lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate extending into alveolar septa can be described as resembling LIP. Because some of the lymphoid proliferations form nodules with invasion by lymphocytes of connective tissue planes, we considered the possibility of a low grade malignant lymphoma such as a malignant lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALToma). However, the infiltrate is not as extensive as generally seen with MALTomas, and the centroblast-like cells characteristic of that disease are not evident (Giemsa stain). We also considered lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, but periodic acid-Schiff stain shows no intranuclear Dutcher bodies. We performed immunopathological evaluation for B cells and light chains to demonstrate restriction. The follicles contain both T cells and B cells. The B cells express both kappa and lamda light chains. Thus, this histology does not satisfy criteria for a malignant lymphoma. I performed additional stains (elastic tissue, trichrome, Giemsa) to further evaluate the slides. The connective tissue stains accentuate the vascular pattern of follicular centers and suggest that they are normal and not neoplastic I understand that the patient has mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, densities on chest radiograph with air bronchograms, splenomegaly, shortness of breath, and fever. Although these clinical features raise the possibility of malignant lymphoma, the biopsy does not substantiate that impression. Collagen-vascular disease, Sjogren's syndrome, and immunosuppressed states are conditions that can produce lymphoproliferative reactions as are present here.",

Like you, I considered low grade lymphoma of lymphomatoid granulomatosis type because of the combination of lymphocytes and sclerosis, but I agree that the quantity of the infiltrate and the absence of atypia indicate that this is not a malignant lymphoma. It is always possible that malignant lymphoma will later develop in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome. This degree of lymphoid proliferation may be seen in Sjogren's syndrome, which is the interpretation I prefer. Some of the scarring is focal. Focal scarring and inflamed arteries are in part unaccompanied by bronchioles. Therefore, I believe there has been an obliteration of bronchioles, probably of the constrictive rather than intraluminal obliterative type. This is an unusual manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome, but follicular bronchiolitis is common.",

I would not make a diagnosis of malignancy in this case, firstly because I do not know what the lesion specifically is, secondly because there is no clinical evidence to support a malignant interpretation, and thirdly because there is no obvious treatment modality if this unusual process were called malignant. I considered an infectious etiology and, in particular, Whipple's disease and Mycobacterium avium/intracellulare. The acid-fast stain is negative. The PAS stain is markedly positive but without discernible organisms.

These raise a possibility of hypersensitivity reaction, but the bronchiolitis commonly seen with hypersensitivity reaction is not present. There is emphysema with free-floating fragments of alveolar walls near the pleura, mucus plugging of terminal bronchioles, and pigment-laden histiocytes in alveolar ducts. These are all sequelae of the smoking of cigarettes. Finally, there is the presence of hemosiderin indicative of prior focal hemorrhage, the cause of which is uncertain.I cannot determine which of these processes is the most important disease clinically. I cannot exclude sarcoidosis, but I doubt it. RB can produce small nodules, but the degree of filling of alveolar ducts by pigmented histiocytes is not sufficient for a morphologic diagnosis of RB. I cannot be sure whether or not a nodule has been sampled. I am generally reluctant to involve emphysema as a cause of respiratory embarrassment based on open lung biopsy, but the emphysema and mucus plugs are quite prominent in this case.Thank you for referring this case in consultation.

The epithelial elements include prominent papillarity, and the cells include both ciliated and nonciliated columnar epithelial cells. The mesenchyme is spindled and possibly smooth muscle in areas. The multifaceted low power appearance with cysts of varying size and a corrugated epithelium in regions indicates a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. The focal squamous metaplasia and hyperplasia are unusual. Occasionally cystic adenomatoid malformations arise in sequestrations. Rarely malignancies arise in cystic adenomatoid malformation, but there is no malignancy in this specimen. The outline of the nodule is like that of a bronchial hamartoma, and possibly this one has arisen in a hamartoma, which would be a new concept but not unlike that of origin in a sequestration. Papillary adenomas have a more monotonous and uniform appearance at low power magnification.Thank you for referring this case in consultation. This is a confirmation of my telephone call. Please keep me informed of any follow-up. With best wishes, Sincerely yours, Eugene J. Mark, M.D.",

            "text": "Patient: 13-d-old male Diagnosis: Mass (periadrenal): Extralobar sequestration of the lung with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.Histologically one sees relatively uniform bronchiolar structures lined by ciliated columnar epithelium associated with a primitive mesenchymal stroma and some more distal airspaces lined by flattened epithelium corresponding to alveolar ducts. The well structured composition is not what one expects in an extralobar sequestration, but it is in keeping with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. On the other hand, a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung generally is not completely separated from the lung; nor does it lie beneath the diaphragm. So, a diagnosis of extralobar sequestration is appropriate as well. The large and relatively well-formed bronchus simulating a hilus is what one expects with sequestration and is very similar to the recent Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. This is all very much in keeping with your interpretation. This is a very beautiful case. Thank you for sharing it with us.I hope you have fond memories of your brief stay at the Massachusetts General Hospital. With best wishes, Sincerely yours, Eugene J. Mark, M.D.",
