            "text": "Inflammation is a natural host-defensive process in the innate immune response. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proven to be significantly efficacious in the treatment of various disorders with an inflammatory component. NSAIDs function by binding to the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes to inhibit the production of prostaglandins from the substrate arachidonic acid. The prostaglandins that are otherwise normally produced by COXs have been implicated in a wide array of physiological events, including progression of inflammation, immunomodulation, and transmission of pain signals (Vane and Botting, 1998). COX-1 is known to be constitutively expressed in mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, while COX-2 is overtly induced upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pre-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (Mitchell et al., 1994, Guastadisegni et al., 2002, Simmons et al., 2004). Induced inhibition of COX-1 in humans and animal models has resulted in undesirable side-effects, whereas COX-2 inhibition has generated therapeutic effects in management of pain, inflammation, cancer and neuropathologic conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Loren, 2002, Jachak, 2006, Blobaum and Marnett, 2007).",

NSAIDs, non-selective non-aspirin NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors are currently used to treat a wide array of inflammatory disorders and for cancer prevention (Shan et al., 2004, Jack et al., 2009, Thun and Blackard, 2009). Selective inhibitors of COX-2, however, have been associated with a small but definite risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The associated gastric damage of conventional NSAIDs and the recent withdrawal of selective COX-2 inhibitors from the market due to their adverse cardiovascular side-effects have generated a considerable impetus to develop alternative anti-inflammatory agents (Debabrata, 2002, Ortiz, 2004, Coruzzi et al., 2007). Plant-derived natural agents may be useful in this regard.",

Although several other cells are often present in the harvested peritoneal macrophage population, the undesired cells can be easily removed during subsequent washing steps since macrophages stick to the plate. In addition, in mouse peritoneal macrophages a sufficient amount of PGE2 is produced by LPS through the COX-1 or COX-2 pathway (Simmons et al., 2004).

As shown in Fig. 1C, NS398 significantly inhibited endogenous PGE2 production and release in mouse peritoneal macrophages exposed to LPS, similar to that observed in response to HC treatment.
