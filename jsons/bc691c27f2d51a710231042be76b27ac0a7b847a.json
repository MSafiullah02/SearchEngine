This delay was associated with an increase in DNA strand breaks in the arterial wall. When the same mouse model was fed a high-cholesterol diet and ovarioectomized there was an increase in atherogenesis. 10 Aromatase knockout mice, both males and females, suffer from a variety of abnormalities including loss of fertility and libido, bone loss, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular problems, and development of metabolic syndrome. 11 Treating arteries from male estrogen receptor-a knockout (ERKO) mice with specific aromatase short-interfering RNA for 72 h knocked down the aromatase mRNA and protein associated with elimination of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) mediation of flowinduced dilation. This indicates that flow-induced dilation in male ERKO mice arteries is maintained by an EDHF/EET-mediated mechanism compensating for reduced NO because of reduced estrogen aromatized from testosterone. 12 We were able to demonstrate the important role of estrogen receptor-a in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. 13 Nuclear ER-a \u2212/\u2212 (ERKO) mice were used to show that ER-a target genes involved in energy substrate oxidation, ATP synthesis, and phosphate transfer are downregulated at baseline and following pressure overload.",

            "text": "The results indicate that ER-a is required for the adaptive bioenergetic response to pressure overload heart failure. 14 During acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses ER-a mediates NO synthesis and the vascular responses to NO involving soluble guanylate cyclase. 15 ER-b \u2212/\u2212 (BERKO) mice were used to show that ER-b -mediated mechanisms protect against left ventricular hypertrophy. 16 E2 (estrogen) mitigates Angio-II signaling that produces hypertrophy and fibrosis in female BERKO mice. 17 BERKO mice are protected against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. The protection involves augmented PPAR-g signaling in adipose tissue and overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2. 18 ER-b also plays a role in the cardioprotective effects of estrogen following global, warm ischemia-reperfusion injury. 19 Myocardial infarction-induced heart failure in female BERKO mice resulted in increased mortality, increased levels of clinical and biochemical markers of heart failure, and impaired expression of Ca 2+ -handling proteins. 20 Estrogenic effects on Ca 2+ currents in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from WT, ERKO, and BERKO mice show that the inhibition of Ca 2+ currents and decreased contractility are not dependent upon ER-a or b . 21 ERKO and BERKO mice were used to reveal that ER-a -and ER-b -dependent pathways regulate distinct, and mostly nonoverlapping, sets of genes that function as an estrogen-regulatory transcriptional network in the vasculature. 22 ER-b seems to modify adrenergic control of small artery tone in males but not in females. This is demonstrated by a gender-specific (male) enhanced response to phenylephrine 23 and reduced endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated relaxation via gap junction communication. 24 NO appears to contribute to the vasodilation response to E2 in femoral arteries from BERKO but not WT mice. 25 ERs play a sex-specific role in small mesenteric arterial estrogen-mediated flow responses and distensibility. Deletion of ER-b affects arterial structure only in male BERKO. 26 In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) human-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription is positively regulated by ER-b and negatively regulated by ER-a . 27 Knocking out the gene encoding the catabolic enzyme CYP7B1 decreased estrogen-dependent expression of NOS and repressed carotid artery reendothelialization following endothelial injury. 28 Female follitropin-receptor knockout (FORKO) mice have an impaired natriuretic peptide system. This could contribute to the susceptibility to develop age-related hypertension in female FORKO mice. This model shows a relationship between estrogen, adipose tissue, and ANP, and it is used as a model for menopause. 29 Aged FORKO mice developed higher levels of Angio-II-induced hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis than age-matched WT controls. The Angio-IIinduced ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis are associated with downregulation of the endogenous antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx) and upregulation of apoptosis-signal-regulated kinase-1 (ASK-1)/caspase signaling in the FORKO mice. 30 ",

            "text": "Transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac-specific Lats2, a serine/threonine kinase, have significantly reduced left and right ventricular mass whereas transgenic mice overexpressing dominant-negative Lats2 demonstrate biventricular hypertrophy. 31 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK-2) is also a serine/threonine kinase. It phosphorylates and desensitizes agonist-bound GPCRs. GRK-2 levels in VSMC are increased in animal models of hypertension. In GRK-2 knockout mice b -adrenergic receptor-mediated dilation was increased while a -adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction was also increased. 32 Confocal studies of cardiac tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing GRK-2 show a clear increase in relative fluorescence intensity of GRK-2 in the arrhythmia-prone subepicardial border zone following coronary artery ligation. 33 Myocardial thrombin signaling, as assessed by p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, was significantly attenuated in transgenic mice with cardiac specific overexpression of GRK-3. 34 Transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac-specific dominant-negative glycogen synthase kinase-b (GSK-3-b DN) were produced. Persistent inhibition of GSK-3-b induced compensatory hypertrophy, inhibited apoptosis and fibrosis, and increased cardiac contractility. The antiapoptosis effects of GSK-3-b inhibition are mediated by myeloid cell leukemia-1. 35 When GSK-3-b was used to create a double-transgenic mouse by breeding with a mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) the male animals had reduced contractility, reduced sarcoplasmic (endo) reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase expression, elevated ANF expression, and premature death. Female HCM/GSK-3-b doubletransgenic mice demonstrated cardiac histology, function, and survival the same as their female HCM littermates. 36 Hypertension was induced using uninephrectomy and DOCA-salt in Axl (a receptor tyrosine kinase) knockout (Axl \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. The results indicate a likely mechanism for Axl-dependent effects on hypertension. 37 Studies conducted in serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 knockout mice (SGK-1 \u2212/\u2212 ) indicate that this kinase may play a decisive role in fetal programming of hypertension induced by prenatal protein restriction. 38 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ischemic preconditioning could be responsible for altering mitochondrial metabolism by oxidizing key mitochondrial enzymes in the hearts of protein kinase C-delta knockout (PKC-delta \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. Metabolic adaptation to preconditioning is also impaired in this animal model. 39 In transgenic mice that overexpress specific cardiomyocyte Ca 2+ /calmodulindependent myosin light chain kinase-increased regulatory light chain phosphorylation was not responsible for cardiac hypertrophy. It apparently inhibits hypertrophy by contributing to enhanced contractility and myocardial efficiency. 40 The hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing the regulatory g -subunit of AMPactivated protein kinase (PPKAG2) resist low-flow ischemic injury better than controls. This resistance was associated with increased consumption of glycogen but this was unrelated to AMP-activated protein kinase activation. 41 The intimal thicknessrelated receptor (ITR) is expressed in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells following injury. The sequence contains a motif common to the Rhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily. ITR seems to be a novel receptor that could play a role in vascular remodeling. 42 Cardiac-specific transgenic mice with increased or decreased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity were crossed with a transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Exercise training and increased PI3K activity prolonged survival in the DCM model by 15-20%. Reduced PI3K activity shortened survival by about 50%. 43",

Systemic oxidative stress was not reduced in gp91phox \u2212/\u2212 mice since there was a significant increase in lipid peroxides probably mediated by the observed increase of the NADPH subunit nox-1 in gp91phox \u2212/\u2212 mice. 46 Heme oxygenase is a cytoprotective enzyme that degrades heme to generate carbon monoxide, bilirubin, and iron. Two rodent models, Gunn rats (hyperbilirubinemic) and heme oxygenase-1 knock out (HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice, were used to evaluate DOCA-salt hypertension. Uninephrectomized WT rats treated with DOCA-salt had significantly increased arterial pressures but the response was attenuated in Gunn rats.

Using HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice Wiesel et al. 47 reported that chronic deficiency of HO-1 does not alter basal blood pressure, but when the HO-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were exposed to 1K1C there was more severe renovascular hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, an increase in ischemic damage, and higher mortality rates.

            "text": "Adenosine receptors belong to a large family of GPCRs containing four receptor subtypes. In keeping with the physiological model of yin and yang (accelerator and brake), receptor subtypes designated A1R and A3R mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and subtypes A2aR and A2bR mediate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. All of the identified receptor subtypes have now been used to create knockout mouse models and some have been used in overexpression models. Various activities related to normal cardiovascular function and to CNS regulation of CV function have been identified using these transgenic models. Some responses are reduced and others enhanced depending upon the specific receptor that has been deleted or overexpressed. 49 Some examples are as follows: in the mouse heart, A1R inhibits b -adrenergic-induced myocardial contractility whereas A2aR opposes the action of A1R and enhances myocardial contractility. During low-flow myocardial ischemia A2aR supports myocardial contractility. 50 Mice with deletion of adenylyl cyclase type V (AC-V \u2212/\u2212 ) demonstrate enhanced basal left ventricular function than WT controls, but there is a reduced response to b -adrenergic stimulation. 51 In the subcommissural bed nucleus of the stria terminalis norepinephrine (NE)induced decreases in synaptic transmission are markedly reduced in a 2-adrenergic receptor knockout ( a 2-AR \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. 52 a 2-ARs directly regulate the release of NE, but not dopamine, at the terminal level in the nucleus accumbens in mice. a 2-AR \u2212/\u2212 mice have been used to show that these receptors regulate dopamine indirectly via their effects on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. The mechanism(s) for this indirect regulation were yet to be described in 2004. 53 In WT mice rilmenidine, moxonidine, and clonidine all produce dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. In D79N a 2-AR \u2212/\u2212 mice there were no responses to these agents indicating that a 2-ARs are responsible for the cardiovascular effects of these drugs. 54 a 2c-AR overexpression increased the development of behavioral despair and associated cardiovascular responses associated with increased corticosterone levels following stress. a -2c \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated attenuated corticosterone levels and cardiovascular responses when exposed to equal levels of stress. 55 The effects of alterations in the level of myocardial b -adrenergic receptor kinase ( b -ARK-1) were studied in b -ARK-1 +/\u2212 (heterozygous) mice and a mouse model heterozygous for b -ARK-1 and transgenic for cardiac-specific overexpression of b -ARK-1 COOH-terminal inhibitor peptide ( b -ARK-1 +/\u2212 / b -ARK-1ct). These studies suggest that the level of b -ARK-1 activity can modulate contractile function. Even partial inhibition of b -ARK-1 activity enhances b -adrenergic receptor signaling and results in improved catecholamine responsiveness. 56 Dopamine (D2)-receptor knockout (D2R \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were used to demonstrate that pituitary vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is under dopaminergic control and may be critical for pituitary angiogenesis via paracrine actions in female D2R \u2212/\u2212 mice. 57 \"Beta-less\" mice are triple adrenoreceptor knockouts ( b -1/ b -2/ b -3 AR \u2212/\u2212 ). In these animals the lipolytic response to NE and b -AR agonists is blunted, but a residual low-affinity lipolytic effect is observed in the presence of catecholamines and b -3-AR agonists but not b -1-or b -2-AR agonists. The residual lipolytic effect is attributed to an unknown GPCR with low affinity for catecholamines. 58",

Adipose tissue is an important regulator of energy homeostasis. It functions as an endocrine organ secreting adipokines including adiponectin (APN). Studies using adiponectin transgenic (overexpression) and knockout mice demonstrate that adiponectin is an insulinsensitizing adipokine and that obesity can result in insulin resistance and diabetes. At least two different adiponectin receptors have been cloned (AdipoR1 and ApipoR2) comprising a novel cell-surface receptor family acting as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin. These receptors mediate increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase, and PPAR-a , as well as glucose uptake and fattyacid oxidation by adiponectin. 66 , 67 Intraglomerular macrophage infiltration and mRNA levels of VCAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-a , TGF-b , collagen type I/III, and NADPH oxidase are all increased in adiponectin knockout (APN \u2212/\u2212 ) mice than in WT, when subjected to subtotal nephrectomy and the resulting hypertension. Changes in the APN \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury from increased inflammation and oxidative stress. 68 Studies conducted on transgenic mice overexpressing native full-length APN, targeted to white adipose tissue, revealed that adipose mass and adipocyte size were reduced while caloric intake was maintained constant. APN \u2212/\u2212 mice also show decreases in preadipocyte factor-1 mRNA and increased CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-a in white adipose tissue. 69 Shinmura et al. 70 compared adiponectin antisense transgenic mice with WT to demonstrate that the cardioprotective effects of short-term caloric restriction are mediated by increased production of adiponectin and the resulting activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.",

Mice overexpressing epithelial FABP in adipose tissue have the exact opposite phenotype. These observations suggest that the balance between adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis is remodeled in animal models that reprogram adipokine expression in fat cells and plasma adipokine homeostasis. 73 Transgenic mice that overexpress protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) glycogentargeting subunit (PTG), driven by the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein promoter (PTG-TG), were found to have exogenous PTG in gonadal, perirenal, and brown fat depots, but not in any of the other tissues studied. PTG overexpression was associated with a modest redistribution of PP-1 to glycogen particles. The results of these experiments suggest that in vivo mechanisms may exist to maintain adipocyte glycogen storage at physiological set points. 74 Regucalcin is a multifunctional regulatory protein in intracellular signaling pathways. Female regucalcin transgenic (RC-TG) rats were compared at 7 and 50 weeks of age. As these animals age disorders of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and liver are observed and levels of gene expression of leptin and adiponectin are reduced. 75 Hemochromatosis gene knockout (Hfe \u2212/\u2212 ) mice have increased plasma adiponectin levels and increased activation of AMP-dependent kinase. Following glucose challenge these animals have decreased glucose excursions compared with WT controls. The decreased glucose excursions are mediated by insulin-independent increased glucose disposal. 76 Feeding a high-fat diet to low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDL-R \u2212/\u2212 ) mice results in obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and upregulation of serum TNF-a . Mice with augmented vascular TNF-a , produced by a transgene (SM22-TNF-a -TG) driven by the SM22 promoter, had upregulated aortic Msx2, Wnt3a, and Wnt7a transcription proteins that contribute to the aortic calcification seen in type-II diabetic mouse models. 77 Infusion of a large number of CD4+ helper T (Th) cells overcomes ovalbumin (OVA)-specific immune tolerance in transgenic rat insulin promoter (RIP)-mOVA mice. This results in CD+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet cells and diabetes. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene knockout (MHC-II \u2212/\u2212 ) mice lack CD4+ T cells. When CD4+ Th cells are injected into MHC-II \u2212/\u2212 mice the OVA-specific CD8+ T-cell response is stimulated. These findings could have significant implications in autoimmunity, antitumor immunity, and regulatory T-celldependent immune suppression, important in xenotransplantation studies. 78",

Expression of human a , 2-fucosyltransferase (HT) in pigs modifies the cell-surface carbohydrate phenotype and results in reduced G-a -1, 3-Gal expression and decreased antibody binding. Hearts from transgenic pigs that coexpress hCD59 and HT were perfused with human blood. These hearts demonstrated increased resistance to human serummediated lysis. 79 Targeting xenograft rejection using single genetic modifications has proven to be ineffective. This led to development of pigs that express human decay accelerating factor (hDAF). Hearts from hDAF transgenic pigs seem to be protected during perfusion with human blood or blood components. They are metabolically stable and maintain acceptable hemodynamic function longer than previous models. 80 -83 Expression of human complement regulating factor (hCRF) in pig organs seems to prevent hyperacute rejection of these organs after xenotransplantation to nonhuman primates. Arteries from pigs transgenic for human CD46 expression demonstrate augmented endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to bradykinin mediated by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors other than NO. 84 Pigs transgenic for human membrane cofactor protein (hMCP) were crossed with pigs heterozygous for hDAF. Endothelial cells from this cross were exposed to complement-mediated damage. Cells expressing both hMCP and hDAF were not better protected than cells expressing only hDAF. 85 Transgenic CMy-mOVA mice were subjected to adoptive transfer of OVA-specific CD8+ effector T cells expressing OVA in cardiac myocytes. The studies conducted on these animals indicate that granulocytic inflammation sustains CD8+ T-cell-mediated myocarditis. This is important knowledge related to allograft rejection. 86 Hearts from transgenic mice expressing viral interleukin (vIL-10), encoded in the Epstein-Barr virus genome, were transplanted as vascularized allografts into unmodified MHC full-mismatched or MHC class II-disparate mice. Results from these studies indicate that a high level of expression of vIL-10 in grafts can exacerbate immunological rejection. 87 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are capable of selectively suppressing the expansion of IFN-g -producing cells but are also capable of promoting the outgrowth of IL-4-expression in T helper (Th) cells thus creating an immune suppressive milieu in the liver. 88 Donor hearts from B6.C-H2 mice were transplanted into WT and IL-10 transgenic recipients. In IL-10 TG recipients murine IL-10 is produced under control of the human IL-2 promoter. IL-10 expression inhibited the development of allograft vasculopathy. 89 Hearts from IL-4 transgenic mice, under the control of a cardiac a -myosin heavy chain promoter, were transferred into unmodified recipients. Although the investigators were able to establish that Th-2 bias may contribute to allograft acceptance in this model, probably by inducing the down-regulation of Th-1-cytokine mRNAs, they were not able to conclude that those reactions were able to confer long-term graft survival. 90 Two lines of transgenic mice express b -galactosidase ( b -gal) exclusively in endothelial cells (EC). TIE2-lacZ mice express b -gal in all EC and VWF-lacZ mice express b -gal only in the microvascular EC of the heart and brain. Using these animal models Rothermel et al. 91 found that EC express intracellular \"self\" proteins to the immune system but this antigen expression does not delete or stimulate a large population of specific lymphocytes that respond to the same protein following conventional immunization with protein or expression vector DNA. The results of these experiments indicate that context sensitivity in the immune recognition of EC exists and that this phenomena needs to be considered in the context of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Studies on transgenic mice overexpressing canine cardiac Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (cNCX) indicate that this exchanger could be an important Ca 2+ transport mechanism in myocardial dysfunction. During ischemia-reperfusion injury increased [Ca 2+ ] in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the result of increased Na + /Ca 2+ exchange activity, can compromise contractile performance and result in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. 92 The NCX gene contains at least three promoters, H1, K1, and Br1, resulting in multiple tissue-specific variants of the NCX. The H1 promoter directs cardiacspecific expression of NCX in both the embryo and adult and is probably responsible for upregulation of cNCX in response to pressure overload. 93 Postrest potentiation was compared in transgenic mice overexpressing cNCX and mice with a deletion mutant of cNCX (Delta680-685). The Delta680-685 mice are devoid of intracellular Na + -and Ca 2+ -dependent regulatory properties. Postrest potentiation was greater in Delta680-685 mice than in the cNCX animals indicating that ionic regulation of sodium/calcium exchange plays a significant functional role in myocardial contractility. 94 Other studies using isolated myocytes from the same models suggest that beat-to-beat changes in cNCX function can occur in vivo. 95 Overexpression of cNCX in isolated myocytes from transgenic mice appears to accelerate the decline of [Ca 2+ ]i during relaxation. Increased Ca 2+ influx also appears to occur. 96 Null mutation of the cNCX gene is lethal resulting in embryonic death (9.0-9.5 days). When transgenic mice expressing canine cNCX were bred to cNCX +/\u2212 mice this did not prevent the lethal results. 97 Isolated thoracic aortic rings from transgenic mice that specifically overexpress NCX in smooth muscle were used to show that NCX was involved in the forskolin-induced reduction of tension resulting from decreased [Ca 2+ ]i. 98 The reverse NCX current was measured in isolated ventricular myocytes from WT and transgenic mice overexpressing NCX. Currents were significantly higher (>twofold) in the transgenic myocytes. 99 Transgenic mice that overexpress the human sarcolemmal Na + /H + exchanger (hNHX), with high cardiac activity, develop hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, and heart failure. These changes are mainly the result of activation of calmodulindependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II)-dependent phorphorylation of phospholamban (PLB ). 100",

Increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in male TNF-a transgenic mice might regulate activation of MMP-9/gelatinase initiating the progression of cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure. 103 Sustained proinflammatory signaling in the hearts of adult transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-b is associated with a profibrotic phenotype that activates Smad 2/3 leading to increased myocardial fibrosis and loss of compliance in the left ventricle. 107 Transgenic mice with murine IL-10 under the control of the human IL-2 promoter fed a high-fat diet demonstrate decreased atherosclerotic lesions compared with WT controls. 108 Overexpression of IL-10 by T cells inhibits atherogenesis in LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet. 109 Willuweit et al. 110 generated transgenic mice expressing a noncleavable transmembrane form of TNF under control of the endothelial-specific tie2 promoter. These mice develop chronic inflammatory disease in kidney and liver but were protected from immune-mediated liver injury following Con A-induced acute hepatitis. Interferon-g transgenic mice constitutively express IFN-g in their livers and therefore have high circulating serum levels and develop chronic active myocarditis. 111 LPS-induced toxicosis is characterized by hypermetabolism and anorexia in mice. TNF-a \u2212/\u2212 mice show a reduction in the amount of LPS-induced hypermetabolism but no change in anorexia. Lymphotoxin-a \u2212/\u2212 mice show the same responses to LPS as the TNF-a \u2212/\u2212 mice. Results from experiments using soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 fusion protein (TNFR1-IgG \u2212/\u2212 ) transgenic mice indicate that the hypermetabolic and anorexic responses are independently regulated. Interferon-g receptor knockout mice showed the strongest anorexic response following LPS exposure. 112 TNF-a \u2212/\u2212 mice show a reduction in reactive stenosis following endothelial injury. 113 Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 knockout (ICAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion at 2 h, 1 week, and 3 weeks. The absence of ICAM-1 expression was associated with less myocardial damage following early reperfusion but the size of the infarction or scar formation was not changed. 114 b -1integrin knockout ( b -1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury demonstrated reduced neutrophil infiltration in the ischemic regions but there was no effect on the severity of myocardial damage. 115",

ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice developed less of an increase in aortic wall area than that seen early in the WT controls but the aortic lumen area was increased to a similar magnitude in both 2K1C models. 130 The effects of 1K1C and 2K1C renovascular hypertension were compared in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. 2K1C animals developed significantly more atherosclerotic lesion area and enhanced accumulation of macrophages, accompanied by a parallel increase in scavenger receptor-A expression in the macrophages, in the aortic sinus than did the 1K1C mice. This suggests that increased generation of Angio-II in the 2K1C model may initiate and promote atherosclerosis via activation of VSMC. 131 When ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice were fed a high-fat diet and subjected to 2K1C renovascular hypertension they were unable to increase renin secretion and blood pressure in response to diminished renal perfusion compared with ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice fed a regular diet. 132 ABCG1 is a member of the G subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Overexpression of ABCG1 alone can induce cholesterol efflux to HDL. When bone marrow from ABCG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice is transplanted into ApoE \u2212/\u2212 or LDL \u2212/\u2212 mice the amount of atherosclerotic lesion developed is reduced. ABCG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were crossed with LDL \u2212/\u2212 mice and the offspring (ABCG1/LDL \u2212/\u2212 ) were compared with LDL \u2212/\u2212 mice after both were placed on a high-fat diet. No major differences were observed in total plasma lipids but IDL-LDL cholesterol was significantly increased in the double-knockout mice as was the amount of atherosclerotic lesions. Plasma levels of MCP-1 and TNF-a were also increased in the double-knockout mice. 133 BACH-1 is a nuclear protein that directly interacts with the highly conserved C-terminal BRCT repeats of the tumor suppressor BRCA-1. BACH-1/ApoE \u2212/\u2212 (double knockout) mice were generated by crossing BACH-1 \u2212/\u2212 and ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. The double-knockout mice had significantly less atherosclerotic lesion formation, a result of upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 in the endothelium and, to a lesser extent, in the vascular smooth muscle. 134 Mice transgenic for lysozyme (LZ-TG) are resistant to both acute and chronic oxidative stress. They display decreased circulating levels of pro-oxidant advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The degree of atherosclerosis was evaluated in LZ-TG mice crossed with ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice (LZ/ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ). Serum levels of LZ were increased, levels of AGE and 8-isoprostanes were decreased, but hyperlipidemia was similar to ApoE \u2212/\u2212 controls. The LZ/ApoE \u2212/\u2212 transgenic mice had significantly less atherosclerotic plaque, neointimal lesions, and inflammatory infiltrates than the controls, and femoral arterial lesions following injury were also reduced. 135",

Three specific fiber-type TnT genetic isoforms encoding cardiac, slow-and fasttwitch skeletal muscle have been identified. Intact cardiac muscle strips from transgenic mice overexpressing fast-twitch skeletal muscle TnT show decreased contractility at acidic pH than the same preparations from WT control mice. 154 Transgenic mice that overexpress cardiac troponin-I (TnI) have serine residues normally targeted by protein kinase A (PKA) that are mutated to aspartic acid and mimic constitutive phorphorylation. These animals have slightly enhanced basal systolic and diastolic left ventricular function but display a marked increase in frequency-dependent inotropy and relaxation compared with control mice. 155 Hemodynamic studies were conducted in mice that express normal levels of PLB and express either cardiac troponin-I (PBL/cTnI) or the slow skeletal isoform of TnI (PBL/ssTnI). The latter cannot be phosphorylated by PKA. Another construct of mice that do not express PBL and express either cTnI (PBL \u2212/\u2212 /cTnI) or ssTnI (PBL \u2212/\u2212 /ssTnI) was also studied. PBL/ssTnI hearts demonstrated a significant reduction in -dP/dt compared with PLB/cTnI hearts. b -adrenergic stimulation increased HR similarly in both groups but at the highest levels of stimulation -dP/ dt was significantly less in PLB/ssTnI than in PLB/cTnI hearts. The authors concluded that phosphorylation of cTnI significantly contributes to the enhanced rate of left ventricular relaxation during b -adrenergic stimulation. 156",

Angio-II-induced hypertension, but not NE-induced hypertension, was attenuated in LOX-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. This indicates that LOX-1 is a key modulator of Angio-IIinduced hypertension and cardiac remodeling. 159 LOX-5 \u2212/\u2212 mice were used to demonstrate that the loss of this receptor has no effect on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, but neutrophil infiltration and TNF-a expression were greater in the LOX-5 \u2212/\u2212 animals. 160 Junctin Junctin (JCN) is a transmembrane protein located in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It binds to the ryanodine receptor [calsequestrin (CSQ)] and to triadin-1. Atria from 3-week-old transgenic mice that overexpress junctin (JCN-TG) demonstrate reduced expression of triadin-1. This results in a higher SR Ca 2+ load but no changes in contractility or HR. Atria from 6-week-old JCN-TG show a compensatory downregulation of the ryanodine receptor that seems to offset the effects of junctin overexpression. In 18-week-old JCN-TG the progressive decrease in ryanodine receptor density seems to contribute to decreases in atrial contractility and HR during stress. 161 JCN-TG mice demonstrate impaired myocardial relaxation possibly as a result of reduced NCX expression and/or increased leak of SR Ca 2+ . Altered shortening-frequency excitation-contraction coupling in these animals may be a consequence of impaired excitation-contraction coupling with depressed SR Ca 2+ release at higher stimulation rates. 162 Transgenic mice overexpressing canine junctin also show changes in the packing of CSQ in the junctional SR and a facilitation of the association of SR and T tubules. 163 Crossbreeding of mice with heart-specific overexpression of both triadin and junctin resulted in offspring (JxT-TG) with a stable threefold expression of total triadin but normal levels of junctin. These animals display cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged basal relaxation, depressed responses to b -adrenergic stimulation, and altered Ca 2+ transients. 164 ",

When identical connexin isotypes form both Connexins of a gap junction a homomeric gap junction channel is formed. When different connexin isotypes combine a heteromeric channel is produced. In the mammalian heart seven connexins have been identified: Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, Cx45, Cx46, Cx50, and Cx57. The Cx40 \u2212/\u2212 mouse has been used to study mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. 165 , 166 Aside from being components of gap junctions, connexins can also comprise large, nonselective pores known as hemi channels. The Cx30.3/lacZ transgenic approach was used to identify Cx30.3 in the renal medulla in mice, rats, and rabbits. 167 Cx45 expression has been found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), as well as in the heart. Transgenic mice that express lacZ coding DNA under the control of the Cx45 promoter were used to discover that Cx45 is involved in the propagation of JGA vascular signals and thus in the regulation of renin release and the control of blood pressure. 168 Cx40 \u2212/\u2212 mice have a misdirection of renin-expressing cells from the medial layer of afferent arterioles to the perivascular tissue, extraglomerular mesangium, and periglomerulular and peritubular interstitium. The aberrant renin-producing cells in these animals also express significant amounts of COX-2 mRNA and this, apparently, contributes to the renin secretion. 169 Cx40 \u2212/\u2212 mice were also used to show that renin-secreting cells are coupled to each other and to endothelial cells by Cx40containing channels. 170 Transgenic mice were produced in which the coding region for Cx43 was replaced by Cx26. Both neonatal and adult Cx43 knock-in Cx26 mice demonstrated slowed ventricular conduction patterns, and both males and females were infertile from impaired gametogenesis. 171 Calrectin is a Ca 2+ -binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and plays an essential role in cardiac development. Cre-loxP transgenic mice with spatiotemporal overexpression of calrectin were created. Protein levels of Cx40, Cx43, and myocyte-enhancer factor-2C were lower than the level of these proteins in control hearts. 172 The overexpression of calrectin and decreased levels of Cx were associated with arrhythmias, ventricular dilatation, and sudden death in 6-10-week-old offspring, and marked edema at 7 weeks of age. The expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel-1, an essential component for cardiac pacemaker activity, was also decreased in the hearts of these mice.",

PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-4 have been implicated in vascular development via studies using transgenic mice and synthetically tethered ligand domains. 179 PAR-4 \u2212/\u2212 mice have prolonged bleeding times because of the lack of PAR-4 function in platelets and are thereby protected against thrombosis. 180 Male PAR-2 \u2212/\u2212 mice have a moderate elevation of systolic arterial and pulse pressures, but no change in diastolic pressures along with a lack of hypertensive response to high-salt diet. This model displays only a subtle difference in the time course of hypertension in response to Angio-II infusion. 181 Extravascular inflammation was induced by injection of recombinant soluble murine tissue factor (TF) in the hind paw of PAR-1 \u2212/\u2212 , PAR-2 \u2212/\u2212 , PAR-3 \u2212/\u2212 , and PAR-4 \u2212/\u2212 mice. There was no effect on the inflammatory response in PAR-1 \u2212/\u2212 , PAR-2 \u2212/\u2212 , or PAR-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice but the PAR-4 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated significantly less soluble TF (sTF)-induced swelling of the injected paw. These results indicate that sTF induces inflammation via a thrombin-dependent pathway, and both fibrin deposition and platelet activation are essential steps with the activation of PAR-4 essential to the process. 182 Corin is a transmembrane serine protease that has been isolated from the heart. It is responsible for converting proatrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) to active ANP. Corin \u2212/\u2212 mice do not convert pro-ANP to ANP resulting in salt-sensitive hypertension. Interestingly the hypertension is exacerbated in pregnant corin \u2212/\u2212 mice. 183 Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are enzymes that regulate matrix remodeling in response to hypertension. Transgenic mice that overexpress cardiac MMP-1 and matched WT were subjected to hypertension induced by suprarenal banding of the aorta. Overexpression of MMP-1 attenuated the development of myocardial fibrosis, prevented left ventricular dilatation, and preserved myocardial function. 184 Transgenic rabbits that overexpress human matrix metalloproteinase-12 (hMMP-12-TG) were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 6 weeks. They developed larger atherosclerotic plaques, more significant degradation of the aortic internal elastic layer, and increased numbers of infiltrating macrophages and smooth muscle cells into the atherosclerotic lesions than WT control rabbits. 185 Tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-3 (TIMP-3) inhibits MMP and regulates angiogenesis. TIMP-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate enhanced MMP activity in the retinal choroids and develop abnormal vessels with dilated capillaries. 186 Strain differences are demonstrated between FVB and B6 mice where disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17) mRNA expression is higher in the liver, macrophages, and aorta in FVB.LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice than in B6.LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Macrophages from FVB.LDLR \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate fivefold increases in PMAinduced shedding of TNF-a and 32% increases in release of TNF-receptor-I than B6.LDLR \u2212/\u2212 animals. 187 The copper transporter Menkes ATPase (MNK) is overexpressed in MNKmutant mice. This model was used to demonstrate that MNK plays an important role in modulating Angio-II-induced hypertension and endothelial function by regulating extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD-3) activity and vascular superoxide production. 188",
