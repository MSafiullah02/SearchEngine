As such, the shift work system was changed from an 8-hour one to a 12-hour rotating one for all staff with immediate effect. The shifts were staggered to provide maximum cover during the expected peak periods. The roster was also made flexible such that with any major incidents, the departmental action plan could be activated without too much disruption. There were also a few reserved staff members who could be recalled at any time. All leave and off-duty days were put on hold temporarily.",

As the epidemic situation apparently worsened, and as a cluster of SARS cases among health care workers was disclosed, the public became more reluctant to visit hospitals. This change in trend was immediately responded to and the shift system was changed to the usual 8-hour one, with the department staff being distributed into 4 groups. The staff were now working based on a team concept and there was minimal or no interaction between the groups. This was to minimize intergroup contact as much as possible and thus, reduce any possibility of the spread of infection between groups as well.",

These duties included resuscitation, intubation, extubation, insertion of a nasogastric tube, suctioning of respiratory secretions and obtaining laryngeal or throat swabs, because there was risk of transmission of infection during these procedures. The PAPR is a powered respirator system, which protects against the inhalation of harmful materials. Filtered air from a blower is generated at greater than 120 L/min and delivered via a hose to the face hood. Air exits through the exhalation valve. The PAPR is used over the N95 mask, eye goggles, and head cover. Relevant instructions on donning, removal, cleaning, and maintenance of the PAPR were also taught to all staff.",

The first was in the ambulatory consultation area, in a corner room, where the air-conditioning system had been turned off and the windows opened for better ventilation. Fans were used to cool and ventilate the room. The other area consisted of 2 cubicles in the critical care area (CCA). These were more suitable for nonambulatory patients. The heavy sliding doors between these cubicles and the other cubicles were kept closed at all times. Staff entering these areas and treating patients with suspected SARS changed their gowns, masks, and gloves upon exit. Two medical officers per shift were scheduled to provide consult for these suspected cases. This was done to minimize contact of such cases with staff members. As the number of patients with fever, cough, dyspnea, and a history of SARS exposure increased, more consultation rooms were required. As such, rapid retrofitting and redesign was performed in the ED to create and partition separate areas for these patients to be seen and treated. An entirely new \u201cfever wing\u201d was created in this way. This concept made it less likely for those with fever to mingle with the rest of the ED patients and personnel. These areas were also installed with a separate ventilation system.",

Nurses performing triage had the same dress code as everyone else in the department.

Guidelines from the WHO,7 Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA,8 the Ministry of Health, Singapore and the SARS Taskforce of Singapore General Hospital were taken into account.9 A questionnaire to assess risk factors was constructed for use at triage on all patients and accompanying relatives (Table 1). On identification of a high-risk or suspected SARS patient, doctors were alerted and the patient was then sent to the respective designated areas for complete consultation and examination. The appropriate investigations were also done. Several suspected cases were identified by the use of this questionnaire. All patients in the department had to use the surgical mask immediately at triage. Educational information and pamphlets were also distributed to enhance awareness.",

Despite this increase of about 30%, the department was able to improve waiting times for all categories of patients. The reason for this was the rapid implementation of the 12-hour rotating shift system once the outbreak was declared. The attendance at the ED now consisted of (1) the usual group of patients seeking emergency treatment, (2) an increase in emergency ambulance case workload, and (3) an increase in the number of public seeking treatment for respiratory tract symptoms. The number of patients arriving via the emergency ambulance service was higher during this period as one of the public hospitals in Singapore, had been designated as the hospital for treatment and hospitalization of SARS patients only. As such, this hospital did not take in any of the emergency ambulance cases. These were then diverted to other public hospitals and Singapore General Hospital, being one of the major public hospitals, received a bigger share of these patients. For the period March 20 to April 10, inclusive (ie, 21 days), the department received a total of 1,518 emergency ambulance cases.
