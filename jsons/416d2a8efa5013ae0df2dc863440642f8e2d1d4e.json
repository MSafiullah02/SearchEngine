In addition, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane-interacting peptides from the HCV core protein, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. Our results show that the HCV core protein region comprising the C-terminus of domain 1 and the N-terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein-protein interaction cannot be excluded. Significantly, the secondary structure of nearly all the assayed peptides changes in the presence of model membranes. These sequences most probably play a relevant part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction. Furthermore, these membranotropic regions could be envisaged as new possible targets, as inhibition of its interaction with the membrane could potentially lead to new vaccine strategies.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive singlestranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae, and is the leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease in humans, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] [2] [3] . There exists no vaccine to prevent HCV infection and current therapeutic agents have limited success against HCV [4] . The HCV genome consists of one translational open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor, including structural and non-structural proteins, that is cleaved by host and viral proteases (Fig. 1a) . The structural proteins consist of the core protein, which forms the viral nucleocapsid, and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, both of them transmem-brane proteins. The HCV cell entry is achieved by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and the morphogenesis and virion budding has been suggested to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum [5] . HCV proteins are very sensitive to folding, assembly, mutations or deletions. Besides, the HCV genome is widely heterogeneous; the errors during its replication cause a high rate of mutations. Therefore, the region implicated in fusion and/or budding must interact with the membranes and should be a conservative sequence. Finding protein-membrane and protein-protein interaction inhibitors could be a good strategy against HCV infection as they might prove to be potential therapeutic agents.",

These results have permitted us to suggest the possible location of different segments in these proteins which might be implicated in protein-lipid and proteinprotein interactions, helping us to understand the processes which give rise to the interaction between the protein and the membrane. Additionally, HCV membrane assembly and budding is an attractive target for anti-HCV therapy, as it has been proposed that the core protein has an important role in viral assembly. To investigate the structural basis of the protein core interaction with the membrane and identify new targets for searching viral assembly inhibitors, we have analysed and identified different membrane-active regions of the HCV core protein by observing the effect of 18-mer corederived peptide libraries from two HCV strains, namely, HCV 1AH77 and HCV 1B4J, on the integrity of different membrane model systems. Furthermore, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane-interacting peptides, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems, to understand the molecular mechanism of viral budding as well as making possible the future development of HCV assembly inhibitors which may lead to new vaccine strategies.",

Membrane rupture (leakage) of intraliposomal CF was assayed by treating the probe-loaded liposomes (final lipid concentration, 0.125 mm) with the appropriate amounts of peptide on microtitre plates using a microplate reader (FLUOstar; BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany), stabilized at 25\u00b0C with the appropriate amounts of peptide, each well containing a final volume of 170 lL. The medium in the microtitre plates was continuously stirred to allow the rapid mixing of peptide and vesicles. Leakage was assayed until no more change in fluorescence was obtained. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 492 and 517 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. One hundred per cent release was achieved by adding Triton X-100 to the microtiter plate to a final concentration of 0.5% (wt / wt). Fluorescence measurements were made initially with probeloaded liposomes, afterwards by adding peptide solution and finally by adding Triton X-100 to obtain 100% leakage. Leakage was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation,",

This assay is based on the decrease in resonance energy transfer between two probes (NBD-PE and RhB-PE) when the lipids of the probecontaining vesicles are allowed to mix with lipids from vesicles lacking the probes. The concentration of each of the fluorescent probes within the liposome membrane was 0.6 mol%. For assays of lipid mixing, 1 mL of buffer (10 HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was added to the dry phospholipid mixture (containing either 0.6 mol % NBD-PE and N-RhBPE or 0.12 mol% NBD-PE and N-RhB-PE, or no probes), and MLV were obtained by vortexing at room temperature. LUV were prepared from MLV by the extrusion method as above, using polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.2 lm (Nuclepore Corp). The use of 0.2 lm pore-size filters gives place to larger liposomes and henceforth greater fluorescence intensity per surface unit. Labelled and unlabelled vesicles in a proportion 1:4 were placed in a 5 mm \u00b7 5mm fluorescence cuvette at a final lipid concentration of 100 lm in a final volume of 400 lL, stabilized at 25\u00b0C under constant stirring. The fluorescence was measured using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer using 467 nm and 530 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm. As labelled and unlabelled vesicles were mixed in a proportion of 1 to 4 respectively, 100% phospholipid mixing was estimated with a liposome preparation in which the membrane concentration of each probe was 0.12%.

The analysis of the hydrophobicity and interfaciality distribution along the core sequence of HCV 1B4J strain (the data obtained for the HCV 1AH77 strain is nearly identical) without any assumption about secondary structure is shown in Fig. 1b [13, 22, 23] . Although the three dimensional structure of the core protein is not known, these data give us a depiction of the potential surface zones that could be possibly implicated in either the modulation of membrane binding or protein-protein interaction or both. As it is observed in Fig. 1b , it is evident about the existence of different regions with large hydrophobic and interfacial values along the core sequence; these surfaces should be biologically functional in their roles as these patches of positive hydrophobicity and interfaciality along the surface of the core protein could favour the interaction with other similar patches along other core proteins, different proteins or with the surface of the membrane.",

For enveloped viruses, the assembly of the virions takes place in the host cell membrane and in the case of HCV it has been suggested that the virus particles assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes [26] where the core protein might play a central role in viral particle formation as well as it might drive the budding process [27] . Significantly, the HCV core protein is very well conserved among different HCV strains [6] and has important regulatory roles on different cell functions. Interestingly, the HCV core protein has been reported to be associated with raft sub-domains in the absence of other viral non-structural proteins [28] . Rafts, rigid membrane sub-domains located predominantly in the plasma membrane are described to be important in the HCV replication cycle, assembly of virions and budding from the host cell. For this reason, we have chosen membrane model systems composed not only of a liver lipid extract but also of EPC, SM and Chol [29, 30] , as mimetic of model membranes containing raft domains. As the biological roles of the HCV core protein can be modulated by membranes, we have identified the membrane-active regions of the HCV core protein by studying the effect of two core-derived peptide libraries from HCV on the integrity of membrane model systems. Furthermore, to obtain information on the structural basis of the interaction of the protein with model membranes, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane-interacting peptides both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. In this way, it would be possible to identify important regions which might be implicated in the budding molecular mechanism, and therefore could be used as new targets for searching viral assembly inhibitors as well as making possible the future development of HCV assembly inhibitors which may lead to new vaccine strategies.",

            "text": "As it can be observed in Figs 4a,b, we have been able to discern different zones along the core sequence displaying different membranotropic properties. When leakage was assayed, and all the values were taken into account for all membrane compositions assayed, two zones displayed significant membrane rupture activity, i.e. regions defined by amino acids 85-102 and 106-123. The first region displayed a high interfacial value along its sequence; however, the second one did not show significant hydrophobic and interfacial values. In this context, it is interesting to note that the region comprising residues 85-123 has been described to be important in homotypic interactions which might be a prerequisite for assembly and budding of HCV-like viral particles [27, 31] . Significantly, mutant core proteins without the 80-118 amino acid residues reduced, but did not abolish the association with lipid droplets [32, 33] . Interestingly, the interaction of a region composed of amino acids 72-91 with the E1 glycoprotein [34] has been described; this region might be also important for association with the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial outer membranes [35] . Notably, region 85-102 coincides with a hydrophobic cluster located in domain 1 of the core protein and region 106-123 partially overlaps with another one located in domain 2 [36] . By infrared spectroscopy, it was possible to observe that the 85-102 region displayed different types of secondary structure, as random structure was the major one in aqueous solution but an increase in b-sheet in the presence of model membranes was observed. Although these regions present high levels of membrane rupture, hemifusion and fusion in the whole protein context, this region might be implicated in protein homodimerization but not in protein-membrane interactions. Sequences 85-102 and 106-123, apart from being the ones which elicited the most leakage effect, displayed also significant hemifusion and fusion activities but region 29-46 displayed the highest hemifusion and fusion values together with low-leakage values (Fig. 4) . As observed in Fig. 1b , this region displays high hydrophobicity and interfaciality values along its sequence. By infrared spectroscopy, it was determined that in aqueous solution, the predominant secondary structure was b-turn but b-sheet in the presence of model membranes composed of either raft or liver extract lipids. This region has two sequential glycines which might confer a high flexibility to the peptide and might act as a hinge around which the conformation could change. Moreover, this region is part of the HCV major antigenic domain sequence [37] , being probably exposed and implicated in protein-membrane interactions. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that uniformly packed virus particles are generated only by segment composed by amino acid residues 1-82, whereas region 29-46 is the only one in the N-terminal half of the core protein found to interact with lipids [38] . For this reason, this region might be an important one for the HCV assembly. Another interesting core sequences pertain to the 57-74 and 155-172 regions, as they displayed low but constant membrane rupture, hemifusion and fusion activities (Fig. 4a ). It has been described that the ability of the core protein to associate with lipid droplets is lost when the 153-172 region containing the YATG motif is deleted [27] . These regions, having low but significant membrane-active activities, might be implicated in the interaction with membranes.",

As shown in this work, nearly all the peptides we have assayed display a major random coil or turn structure in solution; however, their structure changes in the presence of model membranes.

            "text": "Gathering related results in the literature, it is clear that a domain 1 vs domain 2 reasoning is not appropriate to unravel the foundations of HCV core-protein interaction with lipids. The region comprising the C-terminus of domain 1 and N-terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein-protein interaction cannot be excluded. There is a sequence in domain 1 of maximal fusion and hemifusion (sequence f in Fig. 4c ) that belongs to the major antigenic sequence of HCV. This sequence most probably plays a part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction whether during assembly, or fusion, or both. A more exhaustive study of these lipid-peptide interactions might help in the understanding of the HCV budding molecular mechanism as well as making possible the future development of anti-HCV drugs targeted to budding. These membranotropic regions could be envisaged as new possible targets, as inhibition of its interaction with the membrane could potentially lead to new vaccine strategies.",
