In many Western nations there is the expectation that citizens will have the autonomy to decide whether or not to install a COVID-related app. Yet, the more users who install a COVID app, the greater the impact on public health. As explained by Chan et al. [3] , the value of a contact-tracing app grows quadratically with the number of users who use the app. How can we get users to install COVID apps? By understanding and mitigating user concerns and tradeoffs.",

We break down which tradeoffs are relevant for which contact tracing implementations (centralized vs. decentralized, location-vs. proximity-based). Additionally, we compare contact tracing to an alternative technology-facilitated COVID solution: narrowcasts. Narrowcasts are location-personalized broadcasts about COVID hotspots in your vicinity.",
