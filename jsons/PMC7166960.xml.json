It does, however, raise the question regarding the clinical significance and burden of disease associated with those presenting with single\u2010pathogen detection versus co\u2010infection. With the advent of increasing respiratory viral therapeutics and vaccines in pre\u2010clinical and clinical development, our ability to understand the potential roles of many of these viruses is likely to deepen, from both clinical trials and post\u2010licensure data.",

However, old challenges remain and the high sensitivity of these tests raises new issues. The old challenge of whether a positive test regularly changes the clinical management of the patient tested remains under debate. The ability of the newer assays to detect non\u2010viable viral RNA or DNA adds to the complexity of interpreting positive results, and may help explain some of the co\u2010infections. Nevertheless, they continue to improve our ability to understand not only infectious diseases epidemiology but also the complex interaction of potential respiratory pathogens with adult and child hosts.",
