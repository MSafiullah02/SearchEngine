An infectious etiology has been suggested for CFS, although the evidence is not compelling [2] . Many patients report the sudden onset of a flulike illness that presaged their fatiguing illness, and a number of infectious agents are known to cause postinfection fatigue. Reports that viral antibody titers are elevated in CFS cases has led to the speculation that latent viruses may be reactivated in this illness as a result of an underlying perturbation of immune function, and that elevated titers of antibody to common agents may be a reflection of this disturbance.",

Thus, in the group of patients from Atlanta, enteroviral infection was not more common in CFS cases. We were unable to detect evidence of infection with any known human retrovirus, and our inability to detect reverse transcriptase activity in cocultures suggests that there is no common, unknown retrovirus in these patients. This is consistent with other studies that have been unable to detect retroviruses in CFS [26, 27] . We found no evidence of infection withB. burgdorferi, the causative agent ofLyme disease. Infection with B. burgdorferi can lead to a CFS-like illness, and in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, it can contribute to CFSrelated estimates [28] .

In PBL cocultivation experiments designed to detect retroviral activity, no reverse transcriptase was detected at any of the four time points tested. Controls were also seronegative for these agents, with the exception of one control who had a 1:10 titer against St. Louis encephalitis virus. We detected six (23.1%) or fewer CFS cases seropositive for a number of agents. These included C. burnetii, the causative agent for Q fever (3.9%); E. chaffeensis (3.9%); Chlamydia species (23.1%); herpes simplex virus type 2 (15.4%); B. quintana (3.9%); and B. elizabethae (19.4%).
