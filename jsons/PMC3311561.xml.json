Sus scrofa, commonly known as wild boar, feral pig, wild hog and wild pig (herein referred to as wild pig) is an important international wildlife species found on every continent except Antarctica [20]. Considerable research has been conducted internationally on wild pig ecology [21-25], and this research can be harnessed to construct detailed process models to study disease epidemiology in this species. Wild pigs have been involved in the transmission or maintenance of many agriculturally important infectious trans-boundary diseases such as African swine fever [26], pseudorabies [27] and foot-and-mouth disease [28], as well as the spread of important endemic zoonoses such as Brucella suis [29]. Classical swine fever (CSF) is another important trans-boundary agricultural disease of domestic and wild pigs [30]. Outbreaks of CSF in Europe have cost many billions of dollars to eradicate [31], and cause ongoing costs in areas where it is endemic. CSF also has a wide geographic distribution, being found in Asia, Europe, parts of Africa and central and South America [30], but not Australia. Wild pigs are frequently important in the epidemiology of CSF [32], but the issue is complex as demonstrated by Boklund et al. [33] who investigated the potential role of wild boar in CSF epidemics in Denmark.",

Hone and Yip [34] estimated model parameters with field data and used a mathematical modelling approach to study CSF in wild pig populations. They found that CSF will establish in a small population of wild pigs. Milne et al. [35], using a process modelling approach found that seasonality is important in dispersal of CSF during epidemics but made some significant logical errors in formulating their model (for example, that wild pigs will be attracted to water only every 4-8 days in the extremely hot Australian sub-tropics). Kramer-Schadt et al. [36] conducted a review and used a conceptual model to putatively identify the reasons that CSF can persist in some populations. They found virulence of CSF and the size and structure of a wild pig population to be important. They used spatial modelling to show that individual level variation in infection persistence and production of new susceptible individuals was important for disease persistence [37]. Boklund et al. [33] found a complex epidemiology for CSF outbreaks where wild boar and domestic herds co-exist.",

It simulated the introduction of a virulent CSF virus into the population to explore epidemic behaviour, disease ecology and various epidemic control options. Three simulation models were developed. Model 1 was a non-spatial within-herd model in which the unit of interest was individual wild pigs (this model is summarised in Additional file 1; results are presented in Table 1). This model was simply used to estimate herd-based epidemiological parameters (i.e. convert individual parameters such as individual infectious period to a herd based parameter). These herd based parameters were then used in a between-herd model (Model 2) which was the main focus of the paper. Model 2 simulated the spread of CSF across a population of wild pig herds in time and space. In Model 2, herds ranged from individual boars to a group of co-mingling wild pigs occupying a territory or home range. The logic of Model 2 was structured on the recommendations of Cowled and Garner [38] who stated that a number of factors should be accounted for during disease modelling in wild pigs, including distribution and habitat connectivity, density, movements, social and group structure and age structure. Model 3 was a non-spatial herd model designed to replicate model 2, except that model 3 assumed no spatial relationships between wild pig herds. Comparison between model 2 and 3 allowed consideration of the importance of spatial relationships during simulated epidemics. See Additional file 1 for a method summary of model 3.",

The Kimberley region is a large (approximately 300 000 km2), remote and sparsely populated pastoral (cattle) region. Pigs were introduced by European settlers during the late 19th century and subsequently became wild [39]. Questionnaire surveys were conducted across the Kimberley region to estimate wild pig distributions and densities and have been previously reported [40,41]. Wild pigs are currently found across approximately 26 000 km2 of the Kimberley region. The population chosen for disease introduction was located in the Fitzroy River area (see study area and introduction site in Figure 1). Other researchers have investigated the biology of wild pigs in the region [42] and the population structure was typical of other wild pig populations, for example with groups comprised mostly of solitary boars or herds containing adult females and juveniles [42,43]. Average group sizes were generally small (mostly herds of 12 or less, but up to 30 pigs). In high density habitat, wild pigs may be present at approximately 3-8 pigs per km2 (the range in density depending on whether an edge effect is taken into account) [42].",

These polygons represented the core habitat of wild pigs in the study area. Thus, a 16 701 km2 area of \"core\" habitat was identified in the overall distribution of wild pigs (of 26 000 km2). This method was chosen to refine the distribution of wild pigs because the Kimberley region is a tropical ecosystem, is very hot (November mean maximum and minimum daily temperature are 41.0 and 25.6\u00b0C respectively [44]), and in accordance with field observations it is recognised that wild pigs in these conditions require at least daily access to water for survival [24]. Saunders and Kay [45] demonstrated daily home range lengths of approximately 2 km, and it was therefore assumed that wild pig home ranges must be located within 2 km of permanent water for survival (that is, a large wild pig home range must contain some of this high quality water habitat). Permanent water was identified using a spatial dataset from Geoscience Australia [46], with additional data layers of artificial water sources (stock water) supplied from the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (unpublished data).",

Thus the 16 701 km2 area was divided into three polygons of 7563 km2 (low density), 469 km2 (medium density) and 8639 km2 (high density). Relative densities were then quantified using published estimates. Choquenot et al. [24] reviewed wild pig densities in various habitats in northern Australia. These ranged from 1-20 pigs km-2. Twigg et al. [42] estimated 3 pigs km-2 within a high density region of this study site. Given our study site was in a semi-arid region it was assumed that densities would be at the lower end of the range listed in Choquenot et al. [24]. Thus, estimates used for population densities were 1, 2 and 3 pigs per km2 in low, medium and high density pig habitat, respectively. Our upper estimate is thus consistent with an edge effect modified estimate from prior work in our study area [42] and consistent with the lower estimate of Choquenot et al. [24].",

The remaining population was divided into social groups (female groups) with simulation using a B pert distribution of group sizes (minimum group size = 5, most likely = 7, maximum = 45) based on prior research on group sizes [24,42] and allowing for a slightly greater range due to the limited size of the study in Twigg et al.

The time spent in each state is stochastically determined using probability distributions. The time step used in the model is one day. To represent disease transmission between herds it is necessary to consider the spatial distribution of the wild pig population (see sections below). Local herds have the chance of coming into contact where their daily home ranges overlap, and if one of these herds is infected then there is a probability of virus transmission between an infected and un-infected herd. In the absence of good field information, this probability was arbitrarily set at 0.75, with a thorough sensitivity analysis undertaken to determine how the model outcomes change in response to changes in this parameter. Figure 2 shows diagrammatically how disease transmission between a single infected herd and neighbouring susceptible herd occurs. In this way, CSF can spread through a wild pig population comprising contiguous herds. However, CSF (particularly virulent strains) frequently produces severe clinical disease [59] that could be expected to affect the activity of feral pigs [60]. To allow for this, when wild pig herds are in the infected state, their mobility is assumed to decline to just 10% of their normal daily movement and home range (but sensitivity analyses occurred) (see Figure 2). This limits the probability of overlapping home ranges and thereby reduces the chance of transmitting virus to nearby uninfected herds.",

Ninety-five percent of pig herds were constrained to movements within their own home range. It was assumed that since pig herds usually consist of females and offspring then published daily movements of females will represent the movements of groups, whilst the published daily movements of males will represent the movements of solitary pigs. Daily movement distances were estimated from the daily home ranges described by Caley [47]. After their daily movement, a daily home range of approximately 1 km2 was structured around the herd's final location for the day [45,47].

A six week time to detection was arbitrarily chosen for simulations -- this is similar to other published estimates of potential time to first detection of FMD in Australian wild pigs [66] and detection of The Netherlands domestic outbreak [67]. Surveillance was assumed to begin three days after detection of the index case to allow organisation of surveillance resources. Surveillance was then structured around a user defined grid (a 10 \u00d7 10 km grid structured across the wild pig distribution in the Kimberley region was used). Surveillance was assumed to be conducted by aerial shooting from helicopters. Aerial shooting from helicopters is a well researched, effective and humane wild pig control and surveillance tool used in Australia [64]. The number of helicopters to be used (3), how many individual pigs that could be sampled by one helicopter team each day (70) and the area a helicopter can search each day (200 km2) were selected (based on author experience). Assuming 4-5 pigs are selected from each sampled herd (to give 95% confidence of detecting disease, where prevalence is assumed 50% [68]), the number of pig herds that can be sampled each day was determined. A sampling intensity was thus calculated, based on the number of herds that can be sampled each day and the average population of herds within a grid. Whether any given herd within a grid cell was actually sampled was probabilistically determined from the sampling intensity using Monte Carlo methods. A sampled herd was probabilistically categorised as infected based on defined test sensitivity (95%).",

For example, assuming 99% cull at a buffer width of 10 km culling was successful but a 99% vaccination proportion with a 10 km vaccination zone was not.

In contrast, epidemics in non-spatial populations progressed much more quickly (~61 herds per day). This occurred because epidemics were not confined to that proportion of the population in the immediate vicinity of infected herds during non-spatial simulations, but instead could infect herds randomly throughout the entire population.

Despite typical epidemics infecting thousands of wild pig herds, across thousands of square kilometres and lasting several years, the spatial structure of the population meant the number of currently infected herds was just a handful each day and new infections were limited to those herds directly adjacent to the narrow epidemic front. This highlights potential difficulties in attempting to detect active infection in wild populations using agent identification techniques (such as culture or PCR) in which no carrier state exists and immunity to an infectious agent is long lived (e.g. FMD and CSF in wild pigs). This is in accordance with prior research [73]. In addition, given the rapid turnover of individuals in many wild populations (especially wild pigs [74]) the decline in herd immunity may be rapid, leaving a relatively narrow window to conduct even serological investigations. Taken together this suggests that surveillance based on detection and investigation of clinical events is likely to be an efficient approach to finding short lived infections. Alternatively, in situations in which passive detection and reporting cannot be relied upon (e.g. little or limited opportunity to observe the population) then a more structured surveillance approach would benefit from a very good understanding of risk to allow targeted and therefore efficient sampling.",

Populations in Australia are also predictably associated with riverine habitat [40,75]. Our findings indicate that epidemics would only spread relatively slowly across the landscape (~9 km2 each day) and are containable with some relatively simple and well researched control methods such as aerial shooting [64]. An adequate design in our modelling was a control zone width of approximately 30 km around the infected area, in which 60% of herds could be culled (although other combinations of control zone width and proportions able to be culled were also adequate). Indeed, following simulated introductions of disease into the largest and highest density sub-population of wild pigs in the Kimberley region (Fitzroy River populations), disease could be eradicated by culling just a median of 419 herds per outbreak (representing approximately 11% of herds in the sub-population of interest - the Fitzroy River population).",

This was because culling was not targeted to the immediate vicinity of the epidemic but was randomly implemented across the wild pig population. This is likely the reason that our findings differ from those of earlier mathematical modelling studies in wild pigs indicating that very high culling levels (e.g. 95%) may be required over short time periods or that relatively high culling rates may be required for a number of years (e.g. 49% per annum) to eradicate a disease such as FMD in wild pigs [8]. However, our modelling results are in agreement with other simulation modelling studies informed by empirical field trials in other species. For example, in the Ethiopian wolf only small vaccination corridors were required to reduce disease transmission in spatially structured wildlife populations [76].",

Specifically, in every culling or vaccination combination (width of control zone and proportion of herds culled or vaccinated), culling lead to smaller epidemics than vaccination (see Figure 6) (although slight differences in program implementation should be noted: namely vaccination occurred from the outside in, culling from the inside out). Additionally, infection was routinely contained at lower combinations of control zone width and probability in the culling scenarios than the vaccination scenarios (Table 6 c.f. Table 7). The reasons for this could include the time taken for immunisation to become effective, resulting in pig herds continuing to become infected and continuing to transmit disease during vaccination programs compared to culling (in which a proportion of pig herds are immediately removed from the population). The effectiveness of culling provides countries like Australia, where wild pigs are a damaging, introduced invasive species and where control is mandated, a great advantage for controlling disease in wild pig populations. In other continents such as Europe where wild boar are a valued endemic species and effective aerial culling may not be as acceptable, there is greater reliance on less effective tools such as vaccination. This may be equally true during outbreaks in domestic pigs, in which ethical concerns force consideration of vaccination over culling [77].",

They found that attenuation of CSF viruses to moderate virulence, as well as the size and structure of wild boar populations may affect persistence, and recommended further spatially explicit modelling. Our modelling supports their hypothesis, with epidemics induced under assumptions of lower virulence resulting in longer and larger epidemics with higher cumulative incidences. However, in both low virulence and high virulence scenarios, without further introductions infection always died out after several years because as an epidemic front reached the end of a contiguous wild pig population there were insufficient susceptible hosts to maintain the infection. Infection could not spread back along the previous route of the epidemic because these herds had either died from CSF or were immune. These results concur with the majority of published studies investigating the nature of CSF outbreaks in European wild boar populations, in which CSF outbreaks generally fade out after several years [32,50].",

            "text": "This research may assist in the elucidation or confirmation of some important factors that influence the size, scale and behaviour of epidemics. Our results suggest density, the daily linear distance a herd can move, the probability of herd death from CSF and the probability of transmission between herds can have a large influence on the size and scale of an epidemic. Addressing each of these in turn, it appears that density and daily movements are highly correlated. This indicates that at higher densities, or with greater daily movements, larger epidemics occur because infectious herds are more likely to come into contact with other susceptible herds. Arbitrarily increasing the probability of transmission also increased the size of epidemics for similar reasons. In contrast to this, as the probability that a herd will die following infection increased, epidemics declined in size. This was likely because herds were eliminated before they had a chance to transmit infection to nearby herds. However, having a small proportion of the population that are unrestrained by assumptions of home range fidelity or varying the size of a herd's annual home range made little difference to the overall scale of the epidemic. Several authors have found that Australian wild pigs have a high home range fidelity [61,62,78], but have also found that a small proportion of pigs can move much greater distances and are unrestrained to home ranges [61,62]. Based on these modelling results it appears that these individuals would have little influence on disease spread, potentially because the probability that one of these individuals is incubating disease is low, and because clinical impacts of CSF reduce long range, aberrant movements anyway.",

One of our main assumptions was that there are no artificial, human derived movements of infected wild pigs or contaminated fomites in the study area. Given that the Kimberley region is one of the least densely human populated regions in the world, and that there is no commercial pig production, we believe this assumption to be valid. However, were human mediated movements found to be important for transmitting infection, it is likely that control and surveillance programs would be made considerably more difficult. Although there is no field or published evidence of wild pigs chronically infected with CSF [37], Kramer-Schadt et al. [37] supposed that this may have been missed and assumed chronically infected pigs for the purposes of modelling. They used modelling to demonstrate that the existence of chronically infected wild boar may be a plausible mechanism to explain persistence of infection in a region. Other evidence [79] suggests that persistently infected piglets are critical in sustaining infection. Our modelling assumed chronically infected wild pigs, but only allowed for the longest recorded wild boar piglet infectious periods of 39 days, [80] which is shorter than has been recorded in domestic pigs [50].",
