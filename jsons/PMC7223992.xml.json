Bloodstream infections (BSI) represent 40% of cases of community-acquired (CA) and hospital-acquired (HA) sepsis and septic shock and approximately 20% of the ICU-acquired cases (Table 1). It is invariably associated with poor outcomes especially when adequate antimicrobial therapy and source control are delayed [1\u20133]. This expert statement proposes key elements for early diagnosis and adequate therapy of both primary and secondary BSI (Table 2).",

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae account for more than 70% of all CA-BSI though pathogen distribution varies substantially depending on infection foci and patient characteristics [4, 5]. Of note, Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes up to 5% of community-onset BSI, essentially in patients with severe underlying conditions (e.g., immunosuppression) and/or recent healthcare exposure and suffering from urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia\u2014yet, causative strains remain usually susceptible to first-line antipseudomonal agents, with a restricted prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates [5, 6]. After a spectacular rise in the early 2000\u2019s, the incidence of CA-BSI due to community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) now trends to plateau in the United States and most of other endemic regions [7]. Meanwhile, the global burden of CA-BSI due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) is amplifying steadily due to massive spread of these pathogens in the community [4, 8]. Nowadays, the prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates commonly exceeds 5% in E. coli and K. pneumoniae CA-BSI secondary to UTI or intra-abdominal infection and may reach 20% in certain geographical areas, thereby equalling the proportion reported in HA-BSI [9, 10].",

Defective asepsis, a jugular or femoral insertion (versus the subclavian site) and the duration of catheterisation remain the leading risk factors for CVC-related BSI [18\u201320]. The hazard of arterial catheter-related BSI appears similar to what is observed with CVCs (that is, around 1 episode per 1000 catheter-days), with a nearly two-fold risk increase with femoral accesses when compared to the radial site [21]. Lastly, patients under extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are at major risk for ICU-acquired BSI with an incidence density reaching 20 episodes per 1000 ECMO-days [22]. Most of BSIs in this particular population with extended mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are related to ventilator-associated pneumonia or other infectious foci rather than cannula infection [23].",

Furthermore, these tests only seek for a limited number of antibiotic resistance genes so that the probabilistic regimen can only be adapted according to the bacterial species.

The multiplex PCR (mPCR) tests applied on positive blood culture have excellent performances and have been showed to decrease the time to an optimized antibiotic regimen (spectrum narrowing or broadening or even cessation when a contaminant was identified) but not the mortality or the length of stay [29]. One major limitation of these genotypic methods is the limitation of the number of PCR probes. A negative PCR should be interpreted in view of the overall findings, possible source of infection and other available bacteriological results. Consequently, a solid expertise and strong collaboration between microbiologists and clinicians are needed [30]. Besides PCR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) can also be used to identify bacteria directly from positive BC after a purification protocol (not automatized yet), with good performances for Gram-negative bacteria (> 90% concordance with subsequent culture) but not for Gram-positive bacteria (~ 80% concordance) [31]. MALDI-TOF can also be used for antibiotic susceptibility testing, with the possibility to compare spectrum after a short incubation (1\u20134 h) with or without antibiotics, or to directly detect peaks matching the resistance mechanisms [31]. While the proof of concept has been established, direct AST from BC using MALDI-TOF still needs standardization to enter the routine workflow.",

Clinical metagenomics (CMg) refers to the sequencing of the nucleic acids present in a clinical sample to identify pathogens and to infer their susceptibility to antimicrobials [32]. A variant of CMg is cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing, i.e. the sequencing of extracellular cell-free DNA in clinical samples. It has been showed that the absolute concentrations of plasmatic cfDNA in patients with sepsis were elevated when compared to healthy volunteers and that the cfDNA sequences could identify potential bacterial pathogens missed by conventional, culture-based methods [33]. A recent work including 348 patients reported a 93% sensitivity but only a 63% specificity for cfDNA sequencing [34]. Indeed, metagenomic sequencing identified much more bacteria than culture, with 62/166 samples negative with conventional methods but with microorganisms found in cfDNA sequencing. Of note, cfDNA sequencing results were delivered the day after the sample arrival. Another work based on metagenomic sequencing of plasma from immunosuppressed patients found similar results, with a 95% negative predictive value [35].",

In this scenario, there is certainly a need for a balanced use of recently approved agents active against MDR organisms, in order not to delay the administration of an effective therapy and, on the other hand, not to accelerate the selection of further resistance using them indiscriminately [48, 49]. In addition, the availability of novel beta-lactams/beta-lactamases inhibitor (BL-BLI) combinations, which express selected activity against MDR Gram-negative bacteria expressing different determinants of resistance, has already started to change clinical reasoning at the bedside of septic patients. For example, the type of locally prevalent carbapenemases should now be taken into account when prompting empirical therapies [50]. Trying to balance all the above-reported factors, possible choices for treating BSI in critically ill patients, together with their activity against MDR pathogens and dosage recommendations, are detailed in Table 6.",

However, albeit imperfect, some practical and immediately available proxies exist that may help optimizing dosages. First, higher loading dosages of hydrophilic antimicrobials are required in critically ill patients with a positive fluid balance indicating a high volume of distribution (Vd) [51\u201353]. Second, the facts that most antimicrobials used in ICUs are excreted by the kidneys, that either augmented renal clearance (ARC) or acute kidney injury (AKI) can be present in critically ill patients with BSI, and that renal replacement therapies (RRT) are not infrequently used in these patients imply that careful attention should be devoted to the adjustment of maintenance dosages according to the fluctuations in renal function during the course of treatment [25, 52, 54\u201356]. With regard to pharmacodynamics (PD), knowledge of the different PD index of choice (T > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), Cmax/MIC, or area under the curve(AUC)/MIC) pertaining to the different antimicrobial classes is crucial both for selecting the most appropriate type of infusion (e.g., continuous vs. intermittent) and for measuring the impact of suspected/measured pathogens MIC on the probability of target attainment, taking into account possible variability in MIC measurements [25, 52, 57].",

Practically, TDM appears beneficial for minimizing toxicity and/or improving clinical responses in patients treated with vancomycin or aminoglycosides [60, 61], while further evidence and standardization are needed to clearly delineate and maximize any possible clinical impact of TDM on the use of beta-lactams [25, 62, 63]. For some antimicrobial classes with inherent variable serum concentrations, technical difficulties and its frequent unavailability outside research laboratories prevent a widespread use of TDM (e.g., polymyxins, for which nonetheless TDM remains desirable whenever feasible) [58]. Detailed discussion on possible PK/PD targets (either for improving bacterial killing/clinical outcome or reducing toxicity) and sampling times for different antibiotic classes in critically ill patients undergoing TDM are available elsewhere [64, 65].",

However, clinical data are lacking to appraise the relevance of these findings and whether combination therapy effectively protects from the emergence of resistance at the infection site is still unsettled. Interestingly, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 551 patients with sepsis, receiving a meropenem\u2013moxifloxacin combination was associated with a lower risk of persistent or subsequent infection with meropenem-resistant pathogens than meropenem alone (1.3% versus 9.1%, respectively, P = 0.04) [67]. This endpoint was unfortunately not addressed in the gut microbiota\u2014that is, the main reservoir of MDR Gram-negative bacteria in ICU patients.

Besides, adding an aminoglycoside to a beta-lactam-based regimen has been consistently linked with an increased hazard of acute renal failure at the acute phase of infection [68, 69, 71]. On a pathogen-specific approach, there is currently no evidence that a double-active regimen impacts the outcome of patients with BSI due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (except in those with implanted devices) or Enterobacterales, including AmpC-hyperproducers and ESBL-PE [72\u201375]. Along this line, the benefit of a polymyxin-based combination has not been convincingly proven in patients infected with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii though this strategy may perform better than polymyxin alone in patients with BSI and/or when high-dose colistin regimen are administered (i.e., \u2265 6 MUI per day) [76\u201379]. Controversies equally persist about the prognostic effect of combination therapy in P. aeruginosa BSI [73, 80, 81]; yet, no survival improvement was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone versus beta-lactam alone in patients with this condition [82]. It should be emphasized, however, that most of available studies are relatively ancient, include a limited number of ICU patients, and display substantial heterogeneity in terms of antimicrobial administration schemes, sepsis definition, and severity indexes at BSI onset.",

This potential benefit does not exist for ICU patients, and those regimens are likely to cause additional emergence of resistance.Caution is important for sources that are frequently polymicrobial such as intra-abdominal infections. A positive BC may yield a single pathogen, while specimens from the source may identify multiple pathogens. Furthermore, there may be other important pathogens that were not cultured and require the broad-spectrum antimicrobial that was initially started.In silico PK/PD modeling has warned that with conventional dosing strategies narrower spectrum beta-lactams may have higher risks of non-target attainment than their broad-spectrum alternatives [105].Some narrower spectrum alternatives are more effective than broad-spectrum regimens. For instance, oxacillin or cephazolin are superior to piperacillin/tazobactam in S. aureus BSI [106].Risk exists that ADE may cause an increase in the total duration of antimicrobial therapy [107]. Multiple studies on different sources of infection lead to recommend shorter rather than longer duration of antimicrobial therapy and this may be a more important target than changing molecules within a treatment [108, 109].In ADE, it is particularly important to not increase the duration of treatment because of days where treatments overlap. We recommend that a stop date and time is calculated from the time of effective treatment and that this is maintained for the treatment after ADE.",

The decision of escalation/de-escalation/no change or dose adjustments should be taken after 2\u20133 days when microbiological specimens became available [98]. The effectiveness of therapy should be judged after 1 week of treatment on clinical and microbiological resolution of the infection. This will include defervescence and resolution of organ failures and shock, negative follow-up cultures, the absence of endocarditis or metastatic sites of infection and no implanted prosthesis which are all required to define an uncomplicated infection [110]. Problems with source control and/or superinfections at the source will also uncover around that time point. If those are resolved and the pathogen or the source is not specifically requiring extended treatments antibiotic regimen can be safely stopped.",

Some particular source of infections where the pathogen is quiescent or living in biofilms, the presence of an untreatable source, septic metastasis or micro-abscesses also require prolonged therapy. Trans-thoracic/transoesophagal echocardiograph and funduscopy should be performed before deciding the duration of therapy. Indeed, short-term therapy (15 days) was shown to be effective only in selected cases of uncomplicated S. aureus right-sided infectious endocarditis or left-sided native valve infectious endocarditis due to highly susceptible streptococci. Most current recommendations emphasize prolonged antibiotic administration (4\u20136 weeks or even 8 weeks) for S. aureus prosthetic valve endocarditis. Valve cultures should be taken into account to decide how long to continue antimicrobial therapy after valve replacement [118]. Longer therapies are also needed for bone and joint infections (4\u20138 weeks), brain abscesses (8 weeks), empyema (4\u20136 weeks) or, in general, when the source control is impossible or incomplete. It is especially the case when infected devices or prosthesis are left in place.",

Often combined, interconnected and leading to diagnostic dilemma with a very high risk of death. Failure of treatment at the source, superinfection with a different or the same pathogen that has become resistant to the ongoing antimicrobial therapy, residual infected tissues or material at the source or at other sites via hematogenous dissemination will all require new specimens, possibly new percutaneous or surgical control, optimization and sometimes escalation of antibiotics. The duration will need to be recalculated from that point in time. Furthermore, it is always important to suspect infections related to the high intensity of care, such as VAP, CLABSI, or a CAUTI. Peripheral blood cultures, specimens of each clinically suspected source and changing the CVC, arterial line and any indwelling material with sending catheter tips for microbiology are most often necessary as part of the treatment and diagnostic workup. While in patients without shock, there are hints to a benefit for waiting for results of such investigations [122]. In cases with high severity, worsening shock and the risk of an untreated infection, it is often required to escalate the antimicrobial regimen in the meantime. The new regimen should take in account colonization and the most frequent pathogens and resistance patterns according to the source and patient category and always be preceded by new blood cultures and specimens of any potential source.",

The prevalence of MDR pathogens is high or even increasing in healthcare-associated BSI, thereby strengthening the need for prospective clinical evaluation of novel diagnostic tools that enable earlier identification of resistance markers. Pending for such data, the choice of empirical regimen depends on a variety of clinical parameters, with the patient\u2019s individual risk of MDR pathogen being the leading one. Double-active regimen might improve survival in the most severely ill patients yet further studies should be focused on this essential issue. Antimicrobial de-escalation should be considered once culture results become available and the source of BSI is identified and controlled. Treatment duration longer than 5\u20138 days may be indicated only in certain clinical scenarios and/or in BSI due to particular pathogens such as S. aureus.",
