In the common clinical practice, dedicated nurses are usually involved in performing nasopharyngeal swabs due to easily organization, and reduced costs. A simple study design can indeed compare nurses usually involved in sample collection, and ENT specialists under endoscopic vision, in performing the nasopharyngeal swab in the same patients cohort. A higher detection rate in the second group will demonstrate how the collection of inappropriate or inadequate material represent a leading cause of the high false negative rate. Although it seems clear that further evidences are needed to ameliorate nasopharyngeal swab sensitivity, several issue are encountered during studies design. Health-care providers involved in Covid-19 assistance are directly subjected to infective risks, particularly if invasive procedures are performed. In particular, routine endoscopic examinations including nasal endoscopy are considered aerosol generating procedures with high risk for transmission[7]. Other than the ethical issues related to the risk of contagion, other logistical problems are inevitably encountered. A tailored room with endoscopic technology should be prepared in a dedicated environment inside the area at risk, with the consequent costs for instruments, and dedicated staff.",

While there are limited data on the self-administrated tests sensitivity, the risk of a potentially higher false negative rate is not to be neglected. From this perspective, an important assumption should be made for the clinical context. In an effort to reduce the risk of transmission, many professional societies have recommended screening for COVID-19 prior to patients hospitalization, as emerging data suggests that patients can be asymptomatic carriers[9]. Moreover, a health-care providers screening is still encouraged in order to limit the infection widespread into the hospitals when the elective activity will start again. In this setting, a low sensitivity test can be dangerous, and a large number of undiagnosed cases could in fact lead to a second wave of infections. The partial reopening of activities has indeed drawn attention to SARS-CoV-2 tests such as the serologic testing. Although promising results of studies assessing the kinetics of antibody formation after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the WHO does not currently recommend utilizing serologic testing to guide decision making[10].",
