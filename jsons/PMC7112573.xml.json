AstVs can infect humans and a variety of animals, and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route by ingestion or fomites [1]. The genome is single-stranded RNA with positive sense with 6.3\u20137.9 kb in length. It includes three open reading frames (ORFs) designated as ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 [2]. ORF1 encodes a protease and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and has a frameshift structure between ORF1a and ORF1b [3]. ORF2 encodes the viral structural capsid protein that is expressed from a subgenomic mRNA [4]. Within each genus, AstVs are classified into genotype species, based on both genetic analyses of the ORF 2 encoded amino-acid sequence and the host species [5].",

This would be the case of some bat AstVs that can infect more than one bat species [7,8], and AstV species that can infect either cheetahs and cats [9]. Recently, neurotropic astrovirus associated with encephalitis was identified in a sheep. Interestingly, the similarity found among this strain and a astrovirus described in neurologically diseased cattle, indicates that astroviruses of the same genotype may cause encephalitis in different species [10]. So far, AstVs have been detected in over than 80 avian and mammalian host species [11]. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp region suggests that the long-term evolution of AstVs is determined by cross-species transmission events, which occur among distinct ecological scenarios [6].",

The crab-eating fox\u2019s nocturnal scavenger habits bring it in close proximity with domestic animals. This is a negative factor for their conservation, since it increases the possibility of pathogen spillover from domestic dogs to wild canids [6]. It is known that the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) may be a source and reservoir of virulent pathogens for wildlife, including the rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine parvovirus (CPV2) [13], also many wildlife species are reservoir of pathogens that threatens domestic animals [14,15].",

Unfortunately, the samples that were tested by IHQ were not available to be tested by RT-PCR. The recognized effects of CDV on nervous tissue include acute, subacute to chronic forms of encephalopathy, and rare distinct chronic variant encephalomyelitis of mature dogs, termed old dog encephalitis (ODE) [41]. The clinicopathologic features of progressive cortical neurologic signs along with multifocal severe perivascular and parenchymal lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis involving mainly the cerebrum and brain stem are characteristic lesions of ODE that was confirmed at the histopathology description [42]. A number of different hypotheses have been postulated to explain the occurrence and pathogenesis of ODE [43,44]. For instance, ODE may represent the cumulative effects of end stage chronic subclinical CDV encephalitis. In dogs, ODE has almost exclusive predilection for seropositive adults, often with complete vaccination histories. External reinfection of immune dogs by wild-type CDV with subsequent rapid immune-mediated suppression of the extracellular virus production within the CNS could explain the development of ODE [42]. Our results sustains the hypothesis that the Pampa Fox was infected by CDV, possibly when juvenile, it was able to clear the infection and survive, but the virus persisted in the CNS, leading to a late onset of neurological symptoms compatible to what is seen in ODE cases [45]. This hypothesis could explain why the virus was only detected in CNS tissues. In addition to the CDV infection, the parasitic granulomatous pneumonia contributed to the immune depression and made it possible to MAsTV5 strain crab-eating fox/2016/BRA spread to the extra-intestinal tissues.",
