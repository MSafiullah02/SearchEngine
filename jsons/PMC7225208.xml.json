Dr William Wilde, now best known as father of the playwright, Oscar, was a prominent surgeon and author of numerous works on medicine, archaeology and folklore (Wilson, 1942; Coakley, 2016). Wilde was knighted in 1864 owing in large part to his work on the census (Froggatt, 1965; Froggatt, 2016; Geary, 2016).",

From an examination of this epitome of the most remarkable epidemic pestilences, as well as of the famines, epizootics, cosmical phenomena, and other circumstances, influencing, or supposed to influence mortality, we perceive that so far as the annals and records of the country afford information, Ireland has from the earliest period of its colonization to the present time been subjected to a series of dire calamities, affecting human life, arising either from causes originating within itself, or from its connexion with Great Britain and other parts of Europe (p.2).\n",

Exaggerations, rumours, myths and falsehoods also abounded during the Spanish flu pandemic, causing confusion, distress and a great deal of panic (Foley, 2011). Today, social media are especially prone to such issues (Lanier, 2018). In February 2020, the WHO took specific steps to counter the inaccuracies and conspiracy theories that were spreading in both social and conventional media (Lancet, 2020a; Zarocostas, 2020). Various medical journals made reliable information available for healthcare professionals (Lancet, 2020b; Razai et al.\n2020). These steps are important. The experience of the Spanish flu clearly demonstrates the power of myths to persist and the urgent requirement for calm, factual information to counteract unhelpful panic.",
