As the largest known RNA viruses, CoVs are further divided into four genera: alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015) . To date, there have been six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) identified, including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2020) , and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012) . New coronaviruses appear to emerge periodically in humans, mainly due to the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, and the increase of human-animal interface activities (Cui et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019) .",

The case fatality rate of the currently reported cases in China is less than 4%, which implies that so far, this novel coronavirus does not seem to cause the high fatality rates previously observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 10% and 37%, respectively (Chaolin et al., 2020) . According to the latest data, a total of 36167 cases were reported in Hubei, China, which gives a cumulative attack rate (CAA) of 0.11% (the permanent resident population of Hubei is about 59, 170,000). However, when compared to the influenza virus of pH1N1, which shared the same transmission route but had a 50 times higher CAA, these data showed the importance of the intense quarantine and social distancing measures the Hubei government has taken.",

Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, but it requires further confirmation of whether pneumonia infection by the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or through an intermediate host (Another Decade, 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Recent research has found that the virus is 96% identical at the wholegenome level to a bat coronavirus, which means bats are the most possible host of the SARS-CoV-2 (Another Decade, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Also, Ji and colleagues (Ji et al., 2020) (Lam et al., 2020) . For many viruses, one of the key steps in the emergence process is the jump from animals to humans.

Health officials have identified evidence of transmission along a chain of 4 \"generations\" (a person who originally contracted the virus from a nonhuman source infected someone else, who infected another individual, who then infected another individual), suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission (Phelan and RebeccaKatz, 2020; WHO, 2020) . Up to the present, the main infection source was the patients with pneumonia infected by SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, and it can also be transmitted through aerial droplets and contact (Jin et al., 2020) . However, we also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases, which may play a critical role in the transmission process (Shen et al., 2020) . Recently, new coronavirus was detected in the feces of confirmed patients in Wuhan, Shenzhen and even the first case in the United States, indicating that the virus can exist and replicate in the digestive tract, suggesting the possibility of fecaloral transmission (Holshue et al., 2020) , but it is not certain that eating virus-contaminated food causes infection and transmission. There were also views that viruses in feces may be re-transmitted by aerosol formation of virus-containing droplets, requiring further investigation. At present, there is no evidence for aerosol transmission of CoVID-19. WHO also believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission (WHO, 2020). In addition, it has been reported that a mother was diagnosed with the new type of coronavirus pneumonia, and her newborn was positive for viral nucleic acid in pharynx swabs after 30 hours of birth (CCTV.COM, 2020), suggesting that the new type of coronavirus may cause neonatal infection through mother-tochild transmission, which of course needs to be confirmed by more scientific studies .",

(2020a) analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and found the R0 to be 2.2, without specifying their modelling method. Jonathan Read and his colleagues (Cheng and Shan, 2019) from Lancaster University used a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model to determine the R0 to be around 3.1. Majumder and colleagues (Maimuna, 2020) used the Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model to estimate the R0 to be 2.0-3.3 (the study did not publish yet, available at SSRN). Recently, a large group of researchers from multiple institutes led by Jianhong Wu from York University (Tang et al., 2020) proposed a more general deterministic SEIR compartmental model using more parameters, and arrived at a much higher R0 number of 6.47. Recent research on the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, at a looser intervention and quarantine condition, showed the R0 was 2.28, and if the R 0 were reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated cumulative cases would be reduced from 1514 to 1081 and 758, also proving that intense quarantine and social distancing measures should be taken to control the outbreak.",

About half of the patients had dyspnea (the median from onset to dyspnea was 8 days). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 63% of patients. All patients had pneumonia. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), acute heart injury (12%), and secondary infections (10%); 32% of patients required treatment in the ICU. An analysis of 1099 confirmed cases (up to 29 January) conducted by NanShan Zhong's team (Weijie et al., 2020) found that the most common symptoms were fever (87.9%), cough (67.7%), diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%). 25.2% of the patients had at least one underlying disease (such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. On admission, 50% of the patients presented ground-glass shadow on chest CT. A retrospective study of 138 hospitalized patients from January 1 to 28 found that patients receiving treatment in the ICU were older, more likely to have underlying diseases, and more likely to have dyspnea, and the median length of stay was 10 days . Recent studies indicate that patients60 years of age are at higher risk than children who might be less likely to become infected or, if so, may show milder symptoms or even asymptomatic infection (Li et al., 2020a) . Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic Response of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Working, 2020) , with a total of 72,314 patients, reported that there were 44,672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%) among the total number of patients.

What is the source of the virus? And how can it spread around the world in such a short time? At the moment, we know relatively little about CoVID-19, except that it is a highly pathogenic human pathogen, possibly a zoonotic agent. Now that a pandemic has occurred, it is critical that countries around the world take steps to stop transmission and save lives. In addition, we should actively study its origin, tropism, and pathogenesis with the aim of providing some guidance in dealing with this rapidly spreading epidemic. Challenges remain in several key areas, including the recent cases of people who have tested positive for the virus. Can these cured patients still transmit to others? All of these suggest that we should develop more detailed criteria for the prevention and control of the virus, and more stringent criteria for discharge of patients after treatment.",
