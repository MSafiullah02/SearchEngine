Changes in routine activities (sleep, physiological habits and nutrition, etc.) as well as fatigue and anxiety resulting from traveling and performing pilgrimage ceremonies makes the pilgrims susceptible to diseases (1). In addition, high density of population causes transmission of resistant respiratory organisms among pilgrims from different countries (2-3). Consequently, respiratory diseases are very prevalent during Hajj ceremony. They lead to high morbidity, impose high costs on the health system, and are among the major obstacles for pilgrims to perform Hajj duties (4-7). Approximately, 100,000 Iranian pilgrims have participated in hajj rituals each year in recent years (8).\n",
