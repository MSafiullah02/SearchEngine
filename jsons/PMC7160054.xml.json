Despite data collection largely taking place online (before COVID-19, participants had the option to complete the survey in our offices), there were questions about continuing data collection in the context of COVID-19. For instance, among our predictors of interest were participants\u2019 sexual behaviors and mental health/substance use. Yet, participants\u2019 sexual behaviors and mental health/substance may have shifted in response to COVID-19 preventive measures such as physical distancing, isolation, and quarantine, along with other changes such as loss of income, new caretaking roles, and stress about potential health impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, our goal was to understand how predictors identified from our qualitative work related to uptake of HIV-prevention and behavioral health services. Yet, clinics across MDC have been announcing that in-person HIV-prevention or behavioral health services were to be discontinued or limited in many cases, creating new barriers to accessing this type of care. Beyond this, even for clinics that continued to be open for in-person services, it is unclear if engaging would currently be an optimal health behavior, given the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and local \u201cstay at home\u201d orders.",

Through correspondence initiated by the CLaRO PI (Behar-Zusman), we began discussing whether and how to continue our health disparities research and if continuing, how to account for behavior changes and stressors participants may be experiencing related to COVID-19. From these conversations, as well as collaboration between the D\u00cdMELO PI (Harkness) and mentor (Safren), we decided to continue with online data collection, but to develop a measure to systematically assess these impacts.",

Following the development of the initial measure, we distributed and received feedback from over 20 colleagues representing diverse academic training, scientific areas of study, and professional affiliations, including clinical health psychology, nursing studies, public health sciences, prevention science, education and human development, and cognitive/behavioral neuroscience. Contributors to the measure included experts in health disparities and underserved populations (e.g., sexual and gender minorities, Latinx populations, Haitian populations, justice-involved individuals), HIV treatment and prevention, mental health, and substance abuse. Feedback from colleagues was iteratively incorporated, with the goal of capturing a broad range of behavior changes and psychosocial impacts, while at the same time being inclusive of population-specific factors.",

We have begun to learn how COVID-19 is impacting this group of LSMM living in the Miami area, an HIV hot spot in the US. All are practicing social distancing (average of 13 days), and most reported that it was to protect someone else in their household. Participants also reported being worried about local family, friends, and partners, with three indicating they were caring for an elderly person. Although none had been diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly all feared acquiring it or transmitting it to others. More than half reported being laid off or personal financial loss due to COVID-19, perhaps unsurprising given the hospitality industry, which has been hard-hit by COVID-19, is a primary employer in Miami. Half reported a decrease in sexual activity, which we will further explore in terms of changes to likelihood of acquiring HIV and need for preventive services during COVID-19 as more data are collected. Despite substantial changes in mental health/substance use (e.g., anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep changes, increased alcohol/substance use), only two endorsed receiving emotional or social support from family, friends, partners, a counselor, or someone else, highlighting the sense of isolation that this group of individuals may be experiencing.",

Additionally, we hope to share access to this measure to facilitate research and the aggregation or comparison of results on a broader scale, identifying common and unique impacts across different populations disproportionately impacted by HIV.
