In order to verify that these inhibitors exhibit similar effects in both non\u2010infected and HCMV (AD169)\u2010infected MRC5 human embryo fibroblasts, preliminary experiments were performed (Fig. 1). Total RNA was extracted from both uninfected and infected cells at 2 h 30 min and 4 h 30 min time points post\u2010infection (p.i.), following their incubation in the presence and absence of each of the two inhibitors. The extracted RNAs were reverse transcribed and subjected to a semi\u2010quantitative PCR amplification (RT\u2010PCR) in order to reveal a 293 bp rRNA fragment, corresponding to the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) (Fig. 1A,A\u2032), and a 242 bp sequence from the third intron of \u03b2\u2010actin pre\u2010mRNA (Fig. 1B,B\u2032).

Already at 2 h 30 min p.i., an accumulation of IE proteins within the nuclei of untreated cells was clearly visible, while in the nucleoplasm of treated cells only a few, discrete, bright spots were detected (Fig. 2, panels a,c,e). Similar patterns were observed at 4 h 30 min p.i. (Fig. 2, panels b,d,f), although in some cases the fluorescence signal was slightly increased in act\u2010D\u2010treated cells (arrows in panel d). These results suggest that the suppression of nucleolar gene transcription somehow blocks the development of HCMV infection. Importantly, this short\u2010term inhibition of rRNA transcription does not result in the depletion of ribosomes within the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by a comparison of quantities of rRNA present in equivalent aliquots (see the GAPDH signal) of RNA extracted from uninfected and HCMV\u2010infected control cells versus cells treated with rRNA transcription inhibitors (Fig. 3). The RNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, and the intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis; then, data obtained in four independent experiments were submitted to statistical analysis (two\u2010way ANOVA) (not shown), demonstrating that there are no significant differences in the amount of 18S and 28S rRNA under the experimental conditions used to suppress rRNA transcription.",

In cells treated with act\u2010D, although a significant level of nucleoplasmic redistribution of nucleolar proteins was observed, the nucleoli were still detectable even at 2 h 30 min p.i. (i.e., after 4 h treatment with act\u2010D, since the cells had been pre\u2010treated with the drug for 1 h 30 min before infection [see Materials and Methods Section for details]) (Fig. 4, panel f). Different kinetics was observed for viral pp65: in cells treated with act\u2010D, the viral protein was already fully displaced from the nucleolar compartment at 45 min p.i. (i.e., 2 h 15 min after the start of act\u2010D treatment). In cells pre\u2010treated for 7 h with cis\u2010DDP, most of the nucleolar proteins were already distributed throughout the entire nuclear space or otherwise displaced to the perinucleolar compartment at 45 min p.i. (Fig. 4, panel g). Viral pp65 was similarly distributed at 45 min p.i. (Fig. 4, panel g\u2032).",

The nucleolar matrix was still detectable in cells pre\u2010treated with act\u2010D or cis\u2010DDP before the beginning of virus infection (Fig. 5, panels d,g), although significant redistribution of nucleolar proteins into nucleoplasm was quite evident (compare panels a,d,g in Fig. 5). A similar pattern of nucleolar proteins staining was observed at 30 min p.i. (Fig. 5, panels e,h). At this time point, pp65 colocalized with remnant nucleoli only in some of the infected and treated cells (white arrows, in panels e,e\u2032; h,h\u2032). At 45 min p.i. remnant nucleoli were practically absent in nuclear matrices of treated cells (Fig. 5, panels f,i). Nevertheless, in several cases, a perinucleolar ring was still detectable; a similar pattern was observed for pp65 (Fig. 5, panels f\u2032,i\u2032). Based on these results, we concluded that the existence of the nucleolar matrix drastically depends on the ongoing transcription of ribosomal genes. Furthermore, our results show that pp65 is initially targeted to and then released from the nucleolar matrix, before its complete disassembly.",

One of the best characterized nuclear compartments is the nucleolus, which is presently considered not only as \u201cthe ribosome factory,\u201d but also as a multifunctional area that is involved in several cellular processes, including mRNA maturation and shuttling to cytoplasmic sites, control of the cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis [Pederson, 1998; Verdun, 2006]. It is also worth mentioning that some important nucleolar proteins with known DNA and/or RNA binding properties and regulatory functions in rRNA synthesis and cell cycle control, like nucleophosmin (B23) and nucleolin (C23) [Grinstein et al., 2006; Ugrinova et al., 2007], have also been found to associate with the nuclear matrix; thus, they might be able to affect the whole system of nuclear compartmentalization [Mittnacht and Weinberg, 1991; Dickinson and Kohwi\u2010Shigematsu, 1995; Yun et al., 2003].",

            "text": "In this article, we show that early nucleolar compartmentalization of the major tegument protein ppUL83 (pp65) of the infecting HCMV [as previously described by Arcangeletti et al., 2003] is rapidly lost, or does not even become established, following the blockade of rRNA synthesis and delocalization of nucleolar proteins. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that rRNA synthesis blockade interferes with the development of HCMV lytic infection and that the latter is likely to stop at a very early stage, when the new formed IEp72 immediate\u2010early protein is targeted to PML\u2010bodies [Ahn and Hayward, 1997; Ishov et al., 1997; Arcangeletti et al., 2003]. Indeed, in cells treated with inhibitors of rRNA transcription, IE proteins are visible in a few speckles, possibly concomitant to colocalization with PML\u2010bodies (Fig. 2), but further accumulation of this virus\u2010specific protein is blocked. It is important to note that a similar effect was observed when act\u2010D or cis\u2010DDP, that is, agents affecting nucleolar gene transcription by different mechanisms were used (act\u2010D preferentially intercalates with GC\u2010rich DNA sequences; cis\u2010DDP directly interferes with the Upstream\u2010Binding Factor). Taking into account the different nature of these drugs, it is highly unlikely that the observed inhibitory effects are due to their direct action on HCMV. It is also worth mentioning that the lack of IE proteins accumulation cannot be due to the shortage of ribosomes necessary for the synthesis of virus\u2010specific proteins as the effect is observed after a relatively brief time of cell cultivation under conditions of rRNA transcription suppression. Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that this short\u2010time inhibition of rRNA transcription does not result in an overall decrease of mature rRNA present in the cells (Fig. 3). Thus, it appears evident that a regulatory pathway exists that blocks the progression of HCMV infection following the inhibition of rRNA synthesis. To this end, it is worth mentioning that many viruses are able to affect the activity of nucleolar genes through different mechanisms. For example, it has been reported that the HIV Tat protein localizes to nucleoli and interacts with fibrillarin, leading to an impairment of rRNA maturation, as well as a significant decrease in the number of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and directs the cell toward apoptosis [Ponti et al., 2008]. In addition, poliovirus induces rRNA synthesis shut\u2010off [Banerjee et al., 2005], whereas adenovirus infection leads to nucleolar dysfunction and disruption of rRNA processing and transport to the cytoplasm [Lawrence et al., 2006]. As for herpesviruses, infection by Herpes simplex virus type 1 was shown to induce an early cellular protein synthesis shut\u2010off, while the synthesis of rRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as ribosome assembly, proceeded until late time points after infection. Nevertheless, ribosomes show several virus\u2010induced modifications, including unusual patterns of phosphorylation and association between cellular and viral proteins [Simonin et al., 1997; Diaz et al., 2002].",

Therefore, it is likely that the presence of HCMV components within the nucleolar compartment is important for the virus in order to redirect some nucleolar functions for its own benefit. Although the function(s) of pp65 remain(s) to be fully understood, there are many observations suggesting that this protein is involved in the regulation of the initial events of viral replication. First of all, this hypothesis is supported by the previous observations made by ourselves and other groups regarding the nucleolar and nuclear matrix localization of the incoming and the de novo synthesized pp65 [Sanchez et al., 1998; Arcangeletti et al., 2003]. Furthermore, it has been reported that pp65 has a kinase activity [Britt and Auger, 1986; Somogyi et al., 1990] and interacts with other viral and/or cellular kinases [Gallina et al., 1999; Kamil and Coen, 2007]. Finally, Dal Monte and collaborators found that HCMV replication in vitro is suppressed in the absence of a functional pp65 [Dal Monte et al., 1996].",

In this respect it might be important that control of the cell cycle of mammalian cells is connected to the biogenesis of ribosomes at the nucleolar level [Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003; Pliss et al., 2005]. During G1, an increase in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly are necessary to satisfy an increased need of newly synthesized proteins at the beginning of the S phase. On the other hand, it is known that HCMV is able to modify the normal progression of the cell cycle to its own benefit, by blocking cycling cells in G1 and G1/S [Bain and Sinclair, 2007]. Nucleolar components control the above\u2010mentioned phases, mostly by modulating phosphorylation levels of transcription factors that can influence their interaction with and activation of polymerase I transcription machinery [Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005]. Thus, it is likely that the targeting to the nucleolus of the incoming pp65, possessing a kinase activity, represents a crucial strategy adopted by HCMV to take over the regulatory systems controlling the cell cycle progression in order to ensure the correct development of the lytic program.",
