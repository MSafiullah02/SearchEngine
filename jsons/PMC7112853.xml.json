            "text": "Adenoviruses (HAdV) are common infectious agents that cause sporadic or epidemic respiratory infections (Mitchell et al., 2003). To date, 51 different HAdV serotypes divided into six species (A to F) have been identified (Benk\u00f6, 1999, De Jong et al., 1999, Xu et al., 2000). Adenovirus serotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6 from species C, Ad serotypes 3 and 7 from species B1, and Ad serotype 4 from species E are most frequently isolated from patients with respiratory tract diseases (Benk\u00f6, 1999, Vabret et al., 2004). According to a WHO (World Health Organization) study, \u223c20% of HAdV respiratory infections are caused by HAdV7 (Erdman et al., 2002). Immunofluorescence assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and viral isolation techniques are used routinely to detect HAdV associated with respiratory infections. However, HAdV can take several days to grow in cell culture, are susceptible to specimen toxicity, and can be out-competed by bacteria or fungi. Diagnosis by virus isolation is not rapid enough, while direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence lacks sensitivity. In contrast, molecular identification by PCR can be both rapid and sensitive. Most PCR assays detect sequences in the hexon gene (Allard et al., 1990, Hierholzer et al., 1993, Morris et al., 1996, Raty et al., 1999), whereas other PCR assays use sequences in the VA RNA gene (Kidd et al., 1996, Vabret et al., 2004).",

The incidence of HBoV detection in the patients with respiratory tract infections varies from 1% to 19%, depending on the study design (Allander, 2008, Arden et al., 2006, Arnold et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2006, Manning et al., 2006, Qu et al., 2007, Sloots et al., 2006, Smuts and Hardie, 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006). Because HAdV and HBoV are both DNA viruses which are associated with respiratory infections, it would be convenient to have an assay to detect both viruses in the same DNA sample. Towards this end, a duplex real-time PCR assay was developed and validated for rapid screening of HAdV and HBoV in respiratory samples.",

However, the differences were not significant statistically. Moreover, 7 of the 16 patients in the HAdV-positive group suffering from lower respiratory tract infections were co-infected with other respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus in 3 cases, HBoV in 2 cases, hMPV in 1 case, and rhinovirus in 1 case. Similarly, 10 of the 15 patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections in the HBoV-positive group were co-infected with other viruses: RSV in 4 cases, hMPV in 2 cases, PIV3 in 1 case, rhinovirus in 1 case, and HAdV in 2 cases. Fever was reported more frequently in the HAdV group than in the HBoV group: 82% versus 40% (P\n < 0.001). Some patients had gastroenteritis, and these patients were more frequently HAdV-positive than HBoV-positive: 27.5% versus 16.6% (NS). Detection of rotavirus in stools was reported in 1 patient in the HAdV-positive group and in 4 patients in the HBoV-positive group (data not shown). Evidence of nosocomial acquisition was found in 1 HAdV-positive, 5-month old girl who had been hospitalized in the pediatric department for malnutrition. The nasal aspirate and stool samples taken 33 days after her admission were HAdV-positive, even though she had not left the hospital.",

The second objective was to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HAdV- and HBoV-infected patients in our sampled population. There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory agents associated with respiratory infections, and the analytical sensitivity was good, i.e. 10 copies/mL for these two viruses.

Using these methods, the prevalence of HBoV-positive samples from patients with respiratory symptoms is usually about 2\u201318%; using the AB PCR, the prevalence of HBoV infection in our patients was 3.8%. The differences in detection frequency of HBoV DNA in different studies may be explained by patient characteristics or by seasonal and geographical variations. Moreover, the PCR methods would have to be standardized to be compared directly. In the present study, the sensitivity of the duplex AB PCR was greater than that of the conventional PCR for detecting HBoV, with the AB PCR detecting 15 more HBoV-positive nasal samples than the conventional PCR.",

In the first study, a second round of DNA extraction was carried out using 10 nasal aspirate samples that had sufficient volume remaining. All 10 samples were confirmed as positive using a second real-time PCR method carried out in a different laboratory of virology (St. Vincent de Paul Hospital, Paris). In the second study, the AB PCR and the conventional PCR were used to test serial dilutions of two DNA samples extracted from positive nasal aspirates. The AB PCR had 10\u00d7 greater sensitivity, i.e. it was able to detect virus in a reaction using 10-fold less DNA than was needed for a positive result using conventional PCR. Thus, differences in results using the AB PCR versus the conventional PCR are likely due to samples with low viral loads. In addition, the results of tests by the conventional PCR are not followed by nested PCR or probe hybridization, which also can explain the lower sensitivity of the conventional PCR.",

Gu et al. described a real-time PCR method using six different primer sets to detect all HAdV species. Heim et al.

That is, the severity of the disease did not appear to be linked to HAdV viral load. Conversely, the amounts of HBoV in the 30 positive nasal samples were related to the severity of the symptoms. The difference between the two HBoV groups, severe and non-severe, was statistically significant when the comparison was based on the viral load (P\n = 0.006) or after adjustment of the viral load to the number of cells in the samples (P\n = 0.02). Nevertheless, the isolated case of the patient that was sampled twice suggested that the HBoV viral load was linked to the stage of the infection. In this study, the quantitative results were standardized according to the number of cells in the nasal samples.

Other studies on nasal aspiration samples show a very low percentage of inhibitors.

Dingle et al created a stable internal control based on a modified RNA fragment of hepatitis Delta (Dingle et al., 2004). Among the 324 respiratory samples tested, only two cases of inhibition were detected.
