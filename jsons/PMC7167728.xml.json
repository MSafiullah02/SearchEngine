He had been hospitalized for bronchiolitis at 3 months of age. Physical examination showed tachypnea (respiratory rate, 48 breaths/min), nasal flaring, and normal body temperature (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure (110 mmHg/pulse) and pulse rate (128 beats/min). Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 94%. There were subcutaneous crepitations on the right side of the neck and left hemithorax region. On auscultation, respiratory and heart sounds were absent on the left side, and rhonchi were heard on the right side of the hemithorax. Laboratory results were as follows: high white blood count (23 300/mm3) and platelet count (623 000/mm3), and normal hemoglobin (12.3 g/dL). Acute phase reactants were mildly elevated (C\u2010reactive protein [CRP], 63.1 mg/dL [normal: <10 mg/dL]; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 46 mm/h; procalcitonin, 0.29 mg/dL). On chest X\u2010ray, there was radiolucency around the heart, subcutaneous emphysema on the left axillary and right neck region and bilateral paracardiac infiltration. On thorax computed tomography (CT), these findings were seen more easily (Figs 1, 2).",
