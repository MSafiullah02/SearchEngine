Denominators for HIV and age strata were derived by applying age-specific HIV prevalence estimates to census figures for Blantyre District's population aged 0\u201314 years [18]. The former were obtained by apportioning the total HIV prevalence among Malawian children aged <15 years [14] according to the age distribution of pediatric HIV infections in Mozambique, which borders Malawi and has a similarly severe HIV epidemic [19, 20]. Estimates of age-specific HIV prevalence were unavailable for Malawi for the study period. The incidence was obtained by dividing numerators by denominators and multiplying by 10 000; HIV-associated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing the incidence in HIV-infected strata by the incidence in HIV-uninfected strata; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incidence and HIV-associated IRRs were generated with 1000 bootstrap samples.",

We developed 2 logistic regression models with a binary outcome factor for the child's clinical status. The first outcome represented SARI with warning signs (ie, clinical markers of very severe illness) versus SARI without warning signs. The second outcome represented influenza virus\u2013positive SARI versus influenza virus\u2013negative SARI. Autoregressive correlation of residuals was removed by introducing a patient-level kernel weighted moving average of the prior probability of case status. Parsimonious models were developed by stepwise logistic regression, retaining age, sex a priori, and explanatory factors with a 2-sided P value of <.05. Adjusted relative risk ratios for factors associated with the outcomes were derived from these models.",

Conventional statistical techniques (eg, regression models, covariance matrices, and temporal plots) have limited capacity to quantify, characterize or identify factors associated with viral carriage groupings. To assess multiple virus carriage clusters in our setting, we performed nearest-neighbor discrete hierarchical cluster analysis in patients with viral codetection, using the Gower distance [21]. Distance was based on similarity of viral pathogens detected in the nasopharynx of patients with SARI; each patient was a member of only 1 cluster. We defined clusters as those that increased the R2 value by \u22650.05 (using the Ward method); to improve precision, 10% of observations with the lowest densities were discarded. Using univariate logistic regression, we identified factors associated with cluster membership.",

Although viral codetection per se was not associated with clinical severity or season, we found 1 viral cluster, characterized by a high proportion of RSV and A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, which was significantly associated with clinical warning signs and rainy season recruitment. Cluster members coinfected with RSV and A(H1N1)pdm09 had a higher rate of warning signs, but the number of coinfected individuals (within the cluster and the entire sample) was too small to formally test for interaction. It is unclear therefore whether clinical severity in this cluster resulted from biological interaction of pathogens, additive risks from each pathogen, or other underlying factors. Clusters clearly mapped to peaks and troughs in individual pathogen activity. We suggest that this viral clustering, which was associated temporal dynamics of pathogen activity, may have arisen from complex virus-virus and host-virus pathogen interactions.",

RSV was detected in 40% of SARI cases with warning signs recruited during the rainy season, compared with 6% recruited at other times of the year. Thus, RSV may drive rainy season increases in clinical severity in pediatric SARI in our setting, consistent with studies elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa [28, 29]. Nevertheless, the rainy season remained independently associated with an increased risk of warning signs in SARI in multivariable analysis controlling for RSV, HIV, and other viral pathogens. Therefore, the observed rainy season excess of clinical severity in SARI is in part attributable to unmeasured factors. We speculate that these factors include other intervening illnesses and seasonal malnutrition (in Malawi, the rainy season coincides with the so-called lean season after harvest [30]). However, we cannot exclude seasonal differences in healthcare utilization.",

We were unable to determine the role of bacterial pathogens in SARI, as we lacked laboratory data and systematic radiological data to identify probable infection in the context of a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage. Our estimates of SARI incidence by HIV strata were based on Mozambican pediatric HIV prevalence rates because we lacked data from Malawi. Nevertheless, Malawi and Mozambique have similar rates of antenatal HIV prevalence [12, 32, 33] and similarly high rates of HIV-infected pregnant women accessing antiretroviral treatment [34]. We did not assess the impact of HIV exposure on SARI risk in HIV-uninfected children. HIV exposure was associated with higher SARI incidence and greater SARI severity in HIV-uninfected South African children [35].",

            "text": "In conclusion, SARI is common in this setting of high HIV prevalence, where influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and RSV were the most prevalent viruses detected. HIV greatly increased the risk of influenza virus\u2013associated SARI in children, and therefore yearly influenza vaccination should be considered in routine pediatric HIV clinical care. Influenza vaccination in HIV-infected children is safe, but it has low efficacy (<20%) and may only be immunogenic in older children and adolescents with virological suppression [36\u201338]. Viral coinfection was common, with 1 coviral cluster associated with clinical severity in SARI cases. In this context, there is considerable potential for the use of multiplex respiratory virus assays in tandem with cluster analysis to reveal multiple-pathogen\u2013associated outbreaks and disease burden. This approach may expose the potential for synergistic effects of vaccine strategies that disrupt viral clusters. Vaccine probe studies to assess the impact of viral coinfection on clinical severity could clarify complex pathogen and host interrelationships and reveal the true burden of disease.",
