The metabolite [3 H]tyrosine was separated from nonmetabolized enkephalin by chromatography on a Porapack Q 100-120 mesh polystyrene bead column (Waters, Milford, Mass).

Porcine aminopeptidase M (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, Mo) was used as a standard for confirming assay conditions and inhibitor activities.

Leu-Ap levels from the first hour after allergen (70 to 120 minutes) were significantly higher than levels from saline (10 to 60 minutes) and the second (130 to 180 minutes) lavage fluids (P < .05, analysis of variance for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction). There were no significant differences between individual time points because of the wide variances in leu-Ap values. Leu-Ap release between 0 and 120 minutes correlated with lactoferrin (r = 0.58, P < .01), IgG (r = 0.50, P < .01) and total protein (r = 0.46, P < .01) (Fig 9).\nThese experiments indicate that leu-Ap secretion was increased during the immediate phase of an allergic reaction.",

Cell surface aminopeptidase acts as a binding site for coronaviruses.26 It is conceivable that mucus aminopeptidase may bind to these virions to prevent epithelial cell binding, uptake, and infection. Virion destruction could be mediated by plasma proteins because aminopeptidases generate bradykinin from one of its precursors, lysyl-bradykinin (kallidin).5, 27, 28 Bradykinin potently stimulates vascular permeability that causes flooding of the airway lumen by immunoglobulin-containing, complement-containing, and fibrin-containing plasma. Vasodilation, nociceptive sensory nerve activation that conveys sensations of burning pain, and arachidonic acid metabolism that promotes additional glandular exocytosis, also occur.29 Bradykinin is elevated in secretions during the common cold5 and after allergen provocation.27 However, bradykinin antagonists have had little effect in the common cold, and inhibition of aminopeptidase with bestatin does not accentuate the vascular permeability induced by tobacco in the hamster cheek pouch model.30 These findings suggest an alternative hypothesis: Secretion of glandular aminopeptidase along with kininogens of vascular and glandular origin into the airway mucus leads to bradykinin production that is only the consequence and marker of their parallel secretion rather than the primary cause of mucosal inflammation. These competing hypotheses require additional testing that should include human nasal provocations with aminopeptidase inhibitors such as bestatin.",
