For this reason, determining the etiological agents of these infections is important. With decades of research and epidemiological studies, we have been able to establish the importance of known viral pathogens like human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. However, despite these studies, a substantial proportion of respiratory tract infections still cannot be attributed to any known pathogen.",

Whole genome analysis has shown that hMPV exists as two genotypes, A and B. Based upon the sequence variability of the attachment (G) and fusion (F) surface glycoproteins, these two genotypes are further divided into subgroups A1, A2, B1, and B2. Subgroup A2 is again subdivided into A2a and A2b.10, 11 One study has described a strain that is under major subgroup A, but does not fall into subgroups A1 or A2, and hence there may be a new subgroup evolving in the A major subgroup.12 Study of the molecular biology of hMPV advanced significantly with the establishment of reverse genetics platforms, but we still lack a reliable vaccine to control hMPV infection.

            "text": "The hMPV virion is pleomorphic in nature and its size varies from 150 nm to 600 nm.5 The genomic orientation of hMPV resembles other members of the Paramyxoviridae family (Figure 1\n). The genome organization of hMPV is quite similar to that of avian pneumovirus (aMPV), particularly type C. The genomes of hMPV and hRSV closely resemble each other, excluding a few differences in the order of the genes and the absence of the non-structural genes from the hMPV genome (Figure 2\n). For hRSV, the two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2) have been identified as potent multifunctional antagonists of the interferon (IFN) signalling pathways.13 The absence of these proteins may be the reason for the difference in level of host innate immune response observed during hRSV and hMPV infections.14 The hMPV genome is comprised of negative-sense single-stranded RNA and contains eight genes that code for nine proteins. The order of the genes in the genome (from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 end) is N\u2013P\u2013M\u2013F\u2013M2\u2013SH\u2013G\u2013L. The proteins are: the nucleoprotein (N protein), the phosphoprotein (P protein), the matrix protein (M protein), the fusion glycoprotein (F protein), the putative transcription factor (M2-1 protein), the RNA synthesis regulatory factor (the M2-2 protein), the small hydrophobic glycoprotein (SH protein), the attachment glycoprotein (G protein), and the viral polymerase (L protein).15 The RNA core is surrounded by M protein and covered by a lipid envelope. This envelope contains the three surface glycoproteins (F, SH, and G), in the form of spikes of approximately 13\u201317 nm. The core nucleic acids are associated with the P, N, L, M2-1, and M2-2 proteins and form a nucleocapsid 17 nm in diameter. With the help of the G and F proteins, hMPV attaches and fuses to heparan sulphate receptors on the cell surface. After the fusion process, the viral nucleocapsid enters into the cytoplasm of the host cell and undergoes replication. The newly synthesized viral genome assembles with the viral P, N, L, and M2 proteins, and moves towards the host cell membrane. The virion now buds out of the cell, with the F, SH, and G proteins exposed on the outer side of the membrane.16, 17 The P protein acts as a co-factor to stabilize the L protein, allowing the formation of the virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex during virus replication. The M protein plays a crucial role in virus assembly and budding by interacting with the RNP complex. The N protein encapsidates the viral genome and protects it from nuclease activity. In addition to regulating viral transcription and replication, the M2-2 protein plays a major role in virulence by decreasing the host's innate immunity.18, 19 Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae family, hMPV interferes with the host's innate immune system using specific mechanisms. The virus antagonizes cellular responses by regulating pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptor and retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors and other signalling molecules.20 Infection interferes with dendritic cell activity and reduces antigen-specific T cell activation.21 Thus, virus clearance remains incomplete and the chances of re-infection occurring increase.",

Vicente et al. reported that genotype A may be more virulent that genotype B,36 while Papenburg et al. indicated that it was genotype B that was associated with severe hMPV infection.37 Compared to hMPV-negative children, hMPV-infected children were found to be more likely to require supplemental oxygen, to have a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and more likely to have undergone chest radiography. About 40% of children hospitalized with hMPV infection were found to have underlying high risk conditions, like asthma and chronic lung disease.38 The average annual rate of hospitalization was about three times more in children less than 6 months old (3/1000) compared to children 6 months to 5 years old (1/1000). Nosocomial infection has been reported in several studies as a mode of transmission.39, 40 The annual rate of hospitalization due to hMPV infection is equal to that of influenza and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 combined,38 and a recent analysis of an hMPV outbreak in two skilled nursing facilities showed an 11% mortality rate.41 The severity of disease caused by this recently discovered virus and the importance of hMPV pathogenesis and vaccine research is now becoming clear.",

However, in the case of elderly patients, re-infection can lead to severe symptoms (such as pneumonitis) and even to death.30 One study reported that 50% of children with hMPV infection were diagnosed with otitis media56 and another study reported that hMPV infection was found in about 8% of children who came to the hospital with wheezing.57 Wheezing is a common clinical symptom observed in multiple studies of children with hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract infections.58 hMPV infections can lead to asthma exacerbations in small children and adults.31 hMPV acts as an enhancer of COPD59 and patients with COPD are more prone to hMPV infection.60, 61 A few reports have also suggested that hMPV infection in children may be associated with a spectrum of central nervous system diseases ranging from febrile seizures to severe encephalitis.62\n",

            "text": "Persistent infection by hMPV may be attributed to a minimal and late immune response, as well as delayed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity with impaired virus clearance during primary infection.70 hMPV interferes with superantigen-induced T cell activation by infecting dendritic cells. Thus, the proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is restricted and the production of long-term immunity is impaired.21 Respiratory viruses are known to modulate cytokine responses. Compared to RSV and influenza, hMPV is a less effective inducer of different cytokines like interleukin (IL)-12, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-10.71 hMPV infection induces pulmonary inflammatory changes in BALB/c mice and cotton rats and leads to an increase in the levels of interleukins (IL-2, IL-8, IL-4), interferon (IFN-\u03b1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in the lungs. These changes further lead to perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration and inflammation.31, 72 The formation of intra-alveolar foamy and haemosiderin-laden macrophages, smudge cells, alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane disease are seen in immunological and histopathological investigations.67 It is known that hMPV infection induces toll-like receptor-dependent cellular signalling. However, the role of toll-like receptor-mediated signalling in the host's defence against pulmonary hMPV infection and pathogenesis is unknown. In a recent study, MyD88-deficient mice were shown to have significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation and associated disease compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice after intranasal infection with hMPV.73 The molecular events in the pathogenesis of hMPV are shown in Figure 4\n. To date, there is no clear evidence to determine if hMPV remains limited to the respiratory tract during infection or if the virus can cause a systemic infection. There is some evidence that the latter is possible \u2013 one study showed the presence of hMPV in middle ear fluid56 and another showed the presence of hMPV RNA in the brain tissue of a patient who died of encephalitis,74 but further investigation is needed.",

Murine animals immunized with an hMPV cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope vaccine produced less Th1 and Th2 type cytokines compared to non-immunized mice following hMPV challenge.93 A few studies have also evaluated immunization by chimeric vaccines against hMPV infection. When tested in hamsters and African green monkeys, chimeric vaccines for hMPV were shown to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies and confer immunity against a challenge with the wild-type.94 A subunit vaccine, using the fusion protein of hMPV, has been shown to induce cross-protective immunity against hMPV challenge in the hamster.95 Several hMPV F subunit vaccines have given strong levels of protection when tested in rodents, hamsters, and non-human primates.96, 97, 98 In a recent study, hMPV virus-like particles (VLPs) mimicking the properties of the viral surface of both subgroups A and B were tested as a vaccine candidate. When tested in mice, these VLPs were able to induce a strong humoral immune response against both heterologous and homologous strains.99 Although an hMPV-VLP vaccine seems to be a promising approach, more research is still warranted to develop a vaccine that will be effective against all of the subgroups of hMPV.",

This vaccine was found to give complete protection against homologous virus challenge and some protection against heterologous viral challenge, even with a challenge at 56 days post-inoculation.102 All these findings suggest that before an effective vaccine against hMPV can be developed, more detailed knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of hMPV is required.",
