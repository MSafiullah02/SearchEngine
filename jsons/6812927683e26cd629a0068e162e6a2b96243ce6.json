In the first stage, a multicriteria model is developed for each of the conflicting parties, taken as decision makers (DMs) facing evaluations of a set of alternatives according to proper criteria. In the second stage, the composition of probabilistic preferences (CPP) methodology is applied to identify the best alternative for each of the conflicting parties. In the third stage, negotiation is carried out to remove alternatives and to focus on the subset of best alternatives for the group of DMs. The fourth stage consists of applying CPP again to choose one among the remaining alternatives. The model is illustrated by means of applying it to a real-world conflict in Brazil, related to implementation of the New Recife Project. The main features of the model are that it allows the DMs (i) to understand differences and proximities among the positions of each of them, (ii) to strategically reduce the initial set of alternatives, (iii) to advance in their positions towards a common goal, and (iv) to construct a unique final solution quickly.",

The solution can be defined by mutual agreement to determine an alternative that maximizes the joint preference. This may become difficult if there is disagreement among negotiators as to the positive or negative sense to be assigned to evaluations by one or more criteria. If this occurs, initially, guidelines to simplify positions are generated by applying CPP.

By treating the evaluations as observations of random variables, it generates rules based on probabilities of choice to rank alternatives which are evaluated by different criteria or different experts. The first stage of applying CPP consists of associating a probability distribution to each evaluation of each alternative according to each criterion. The key idea is that each evaluation assessment determines a value around which it may vary. Instead of exact values, the evaluations are treated as location parameters of the probability distributions of possible values that would be assigned to the same alternative in other preference assessments under similar circumstances. Thus, the exact values of the decision matrix are turned into parameters of random variables.",

In the first choice, the progressive DM wants to decide on the basis of probabilities of maximizing the preference according to the criteria, while the conservative DM prefers to consider the probabilities of not minimizing it. The progressive DM pays attention to distances to the extremes of excellence, while the conservative one pays attention to distances to the extremes of worst performance.

Alternatively, from the pessimistic point of view, the global preference is measured by the probability of maximizing the preference according to all the criteria or not minimizing it with respect to any of them.

Whatever the form of the multiple criteria used, the transformation of the initial evaluations into probabilities of being the most preferred increases the importance of those criteria that are most able to highlight a preferred option. The second characteristic stems from the attention that CPP gives to the set of alternatives that are being compared in order to determine the context of the decision problem to be solved. As DMs who are also the negotiators reach agreement on which criteria adequately represent the opposing points of view, CPP can be used to help each negotiator eliminate the least preferred alternatives. By limiting the set of alternatives to those most preferred by at least one of the negotiators, the positions in conflict can be more clearly shown. Thus, it becomes easier for each negotiator to associate himself/herself with one or more of the others negotiators to reach a final decision in a space of simpler alternatives.",

The project is part of a plan to renew and revitalize the area. Revitalization plans for the area include the objective of attracting people to live in the area, most of which has had few residents for many years due to earlier redevelopments which, for a variety of reasons, drew the population of all social levels away. Over the last 20 years, one of the largest software development hubs in Brazil has been created in the historic downtown and even more recently the old port has been modernized both for sea-going trade and as an area of leisure and for cultural events. However, there is little residential housing, and so the conversion of the Dock area is seen as an opportunity for residential development.",

First, the balance between low-cost housing and homes for professionals is regarded by some as excessively favoring professionals and the interests of the developers. Secondly, some environmentalists claim that erecting residential towers will form a curtain that will cause the temperature of downtown to rise as the prevailing wind will no longer cool the area. Thirdly, some urbanists consider that residential towers will block landscape views of and from the city and that this would be a severe loss of an intangible asset that is central to the image of the sea-front of Recife.",
