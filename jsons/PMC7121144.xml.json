This can be achieved by use of inactivated vaccines (conventional) and vector vaccines (recombinant). The viral subtype similar to the field virus is contained in the conventional vaccine enabling field exposure detection when regular testing of the unvaccinated sentinels is done. Even though the system is applicable in the field but rather impracticable especially to identify sentinel birds in premises (containing birds raised in floors). On the basis of the detection of anti-NS1 antibodies a more encouraging system has been developed and has found its use in all vaccines provided they possess haemagglutinin (HA) subtype similar to field virus (Tumpey et al. 2005). The NS1 protein synthesis occurs only during active process of replication of the virus and this forms the basis of such system. It is therefore rarely present in inactivated vaccines. Only after field exposure, birds vaccinated with such vaccines will develop anti-NS1 antibodies (Tumpey et al. 2005; Dundon et al. 2006).",

Routine vaccination can then be continuously used with proper employment of suitable contingency plan in place dealing with possible re-emergence of the disease. In recent years, in several occasions, vaccination against AI infections due to H5 and H7 subtypes of AI viruses has been used with the objective to control and to eradicate the disease up to certain extent. It is important to note that in order to contain AI infections effectively vaccination should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of control including biosecurity and quarantine, surveillance and eradication along with elimination of infected poultry and poultry at risk. Potent vaccination can lead to increase in the resistance to infection, reduction in virus replication as well as shedding and reduction in transmission of virus. Under experimental conditions, even though a wide variety of vaccines against AI have been developed and tested, only whole AI virus vaccines (inactivated) and recombinant H5-AI have been licensed and used widely in various countries. In local conditions, adaptation of AI vaccination programmes is required in order to guarantee efficacy and sustainability. In diverse situations, modulation of the vaccination programmes is required according to the strain of the virus involved, poultry producing sector and its characteristics and capacity of the infrastructure of the veterinary services along with available adequate resources (Ellis et al. 2005; Marangon et al. 2008).",

It was estimated that the average national vaccination coverage rate was 41.9 % and the global AI vaccine coverage rate was 10.9 % for all poultry with the assumption that vaccines were used at two to three doses per bird in these 15 vaccinating countries. Hong Kong had the highest (~100 %) national coverage rate for poultry, while Israel and the Netherlands had lowest national coverage (<0.01 %) for poultry. During this period, the proportion of the inactivated AI vaccines and live recombinant virus vaccines against AI was found to be 95.5 and 4.5 %, respectively. Four countries (People\u2019s Republic of China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam) employed 99 % of these vaccines; majority of these vaccines were used in the H5N1 HPAI panzootic. The World Organisation for Animal Health in 2006 made it mandatory to report LPNAI due to the potential of some H5 and H7 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses to mutate to HPAI viruses. The number of outbreaks reported for LPNAI has been fewer than of HPAI, and only six countries used vaccine in control programmes, accounting for 8.1 % of the total H5/H7 AI vaccine usage, as compared to 91.9 % of the vaccine used against HPAI.

Until this event, culling was considered to be a preferred control measure by the policy makers, than vaccination. The main reason against vaccination was that vaccination does not prevent infection, or viral shedding, but will often mitigate clinical signs. Vaccinal protection is subtype specific and therefore, the vaccine will protect against that particular HA type(s) and not against the other HA types. Therefore, vaccination could allow a highly pathogenic form of the virus to infect and to replicate within a flock without being detected, and allow it to potentially spread to other susceptible birds. The differentiation between infected and uninfected vaccinated animals was not possible until couple of years back. Therefore, trade barriers were imposed even on the vaccinated animals since these were showing the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies. In spite of the threat of trade bans, poultry was vaccinated in certain countries, because it helped in bringing the outbreaks under control as the vaccination led to reduced severity of clinical signs, less shedding of the virus resulting in reduced viral load in the environment and more amount of virus needed to infect a bird.",

However, interference of vaccine-induced antibody with any serosurveillance and epidemiological programme is a major limitation of the use of these vaccines. DIVA strategy can be employed that easily differentiates the birds that were naturally infected with influenza from those that were vaccinated. The whole killed vaccine has been used in a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated) strategy to vaccinate birds in and around the movement control zone of an infected area. Italian officials implemented this strategy following a series of consecutive AI outbreaks in their poultry population. They attribute the eradication of AI from their domestic poultry, in large, to the use of vaccine in addition to stamping out, biosecurity and surveillance.",

The serological surveillance will not be impeded by such recombinant or purified HA vaccines as the recipient sera will not react in the double immunodiffusion test, because antibodies against the NP or M antigens that are common to all AI viruses and react in this test, will not be produced. However, these vaccines replicate poorly in birds that were naturally exposed to, or were vaccinated with the vector virus (Swayne et al. 2000b). It has been found that chickens receiving even a single dose of plasmids expressing H5 and H7 HAs were protected from infection by either subtype (Kodihalli et al. 1997, 2000). The promoters and cytokines can influence the development of immunity following influenza DNA vaccination (Swayne 2003; Chen 2004). The reverse genetics techniques have been exploited to develop candidate vaccine viruses against the HPAI viruses including H5N1 subtype virus (Liu et al. 2003; Neumann et al. 2003; Webby et al. 2004; Nicolson et al. 2005; Tian et al. 2005). The reassortant viruses generated using this technology, containing the same H5 and H7 HA gene as the challenge virus, but a heterologous NA gene, can help in differentiating the infected and vaccinated birds (DIVA strategy) (Lee et al. 2004). The gene-deleted mutants may be the probable candidates of future live AIV vaccines (Swayne 2004) however; the inherent risk of generation of pathogenic disease-causing strains by reassortment of such vaccine virus with field viruses in nature should always be kept in mind. In order to differentiate infected from vaccinated flocks, a different NA is used in the vaccine to allow differentiation with the field virus infection by detection of specific antibodies against the NA of prevailing field virus in the vaccinated birds. DIVA strategy using these kinds of \u2018marker vaccines\u2019, with a heterologous strain differing in NA from the circulating field virus has been successfully used in Italy during the outbreaks of H7N1 (Marangon et al. 2003). The combination of a \u2018DIVA\u2019 strategy and efficient disease monitoring system should prove to be quite effective measure for the control of AIV infections in poultry (Capua and Marangon 2003; Bano et al. 2003; Capua et al. 2004). This strategy can help countries to escape from trade restrictions. In one vaccine used in one type of DIVA strategy, the haemmagglutinin subtype of both the vaccine strain and the field strain circulating in the population was same, but their NA subtype was different. Such a DIVA strategy was used to control the H7N1 bird flu outbreak that occurred in Italy in the year 2000\u20132001 with a vaccine containing H7N3 strain. Both vaccinated birds as well as infected birds developed antibodies to H7 proteins. However, anti-N1 antibodies could be detected only in the birds infected with the circulating H7N1 strain and not in the vaccinated birds which developed antibodies to N3 instead of N1. The validation and approval by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), and the EU of this DIVA strategy was instrumental in putting up a new recommendation. Consequently, for the first time trade bans were lifted and the products from vaccinated, uninfected animals could be traded in the EU.",

The H5N1 or H7N8 subtype AI viruses have not been identified in poultry in the US. The absence of these heterologous NAs (N1 or N8) was used in DIVA. The technique of reverse genetics was employed to create influenza virus reassortants (rH5N1 and rH7N8), that were used as vaccine strains. The protective immunity induced in specific pathogen-free chickens by reassortant influenza vaccines (rH5N1 and rH7N8) was comparable to homologous H5N2 and H7N2 vaccines. The NA inhibition or indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests were able to differentiate infected and vaccinated birds due to the induction and presence of different anti-neuraminidase antibodies in the sera of the birds. The differentiation of infected from vaccinated poultry is not always based on structural proteins. The assays based on the detection of antibodies to nonstructural (NS1) protein of influenza A virus have been reported (Tumpey et al. 2005). The experimental studies on the \u2018DIVA\u2019 vaccines generated using reverse genetics system has also proved to be efficient in giving protection to the flocks against challenge viruses (Lee et al. 2004). The subunit and killed whole-virus vaccines have also been included in DIVA strategy. This type of DIVA strategy may fail in two situations: (i) emergence of a field virus with a different N antigen than the existing field virus (ii) or simultaneous circulation of subtypes with different N antigens was already occurring in the field conditions.",

It is easier to carry out vaccination of commercial poultry farms, whereas significant logistical and technical problems may be faced while vaccinating backyard and non-confined poultry. Reaction of domestic ducks is different from that of terrestrial poultry to HPAI vaccination on the basis of the fact that virus may be shed on challenge and therefore remain infective potentially. For monitoring vaccinated domestic flocks of duck it is essential to undertake serological monitoring by DIVA strategy along with the use of sentinel domestic ducks. To control domestic duck-borne HPAI infective reservoirs, a major step would be the successful use of HPAI vaccination that may be a major source of re-infection of terrestrial poultry. However, a different course in domestic ducks is seen during HPAI disease syndrome unique in comparison to other poultry. Virus shedding in ducks is constant but morbidity and mortality are low. Currently, the efficacy of OIE approved vaccines has not been clearly recognised in domestic ducks, thereby requiring further epidemiological as well as field studies. In domestic ducks some vaccines may be effective as per pilot studies in China but requires further investigation. The effectiveness of poultry vaccine (H5 based) in domestic ducks has to be evaluated by coordinated efforts of FAO, OIE and their partners. Its outcome in domestic ducks will have a great bearing to formulate future strategies to control shedding of virus in reservoir host (Guan 2005).",

The responses of various countries to AI outbreaks, the subsequent situations and circumstances, are quite variable. The economic status, capacity of diagnostic services of the countries and other factors influence these responses. Work has been carried out to determine how the HPAI control programme is affected by a country\u2019s poultry density, the performance of its Veterinary Services and its economic indicators (gross domestic product (GDP), agricultural gross domestic product (AGDP), gross national income (GNI), human development index (HDI) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) status). It has been found that as poultry density increases for least developed countries, there is an increase in the number and duration of HPAI outbreaks and in the time taken for eradication of the disease. Member OECD Countries, i.e. those with high-income economies, transparency and good governance, had shorter and significantly fewer HPAI outbreaks, quicker eradication times, lower mortality rates and higher culling rates than non-OECD countries. Direct economic indicators such as GDP, AGDP, % AGDP, GDP per capita, GNI and HDI do not show a significant association with HPAI control data. The assessment of various countries with \u2018OIE Tool for the Evaluation of Performance of Veterinary Services\u2019 revealed that HPAI control measures were much better in countries that had effective and efficient Veterinary Services (Pavade et al. 2011). In this context, especially the pro-poor disease control programmes are important. Many poor people of the world depend on small-scale or backyard poultry for the sake of their occupation without having access to veterinary services. At village level, these low-income groups can be maintained by this strategy via recovery of animal health services by means of organising early warning networks that are community based. Utilisation of the existing pool of para-veterinary workers at village, increment in the general awareness of the farmers through simple guidelines of biosecurity on AI control by use of local language publications, provision of access to credit or microfinance as a tool for remedy as an alternative to reward (direct) that is not affordable by some countries, are some of the other approaches to maintain the strategy. Developing groups and/or associations of farmers help in progressing alertness as well as for broadcasting of information. However, it is important not to forget indirect costs accounted usually for in the assessment of benefits and results from abridged levels or values of production due to temporary or permanent changes to management systems/markets. Certain expenditures such as transfer costs are excluded from the total cost of an HPAI control strategy as they do not represent additional resource utilisation but only symbolises transfer of loss between the stakeholders. For estimation of the impact of an HPAI control strategy on stakeholders individually, some of them such as reimbursement and subsidies are important. Particularly important in such situation of HPAI is compensation/reimbursement. Urging for providing compensation is either: to persuade acquiescence with culling regulations and to avoid a crisis in livelihood. Heavy financial losses may be incurred upon by farmers whose birds have been culled thereby making them unable to finance the restocking cost. A decision is required while estimating the compensation cost only for the birds\u2019 market value or to include the lost production value. Receipt of full compensation for losses including \u2018down time\u2019 in the system of production is rare for any country or for any disease. The market value is more commonly received for the lost animal or bird or a certain portion of the value. Provision of minimum credit on no interest ground is an alternative to compensation (Vannasouk 2004).",

Restructuring must be regularised which will affect several segments of the sector in various ways and rates. These variations have resulted in undertaking general principles only (www.saarc.org; http://www.ecosecretariat.org/Directorates/dem.htm) which are listed below:Rationale for restructuring must be based on a concrete analysis of socio-economic impact considering the stakeholders\u2019 interest.Government commitment with full-fledged support from stakeholders is important and should abide by a long-term strategy.Livelihoods of small-scale poultry farmers, who stand for greater proportion of poultry in several HPAI-affected countries must be taken into consideration.Market forces should prepare the reconstructing strategy taking into consideration commercial as well as small-scale poultry producers.Public and private sectors should collaborate and show transparency to execute restructuring strategies.Restructuring should be an integral part of an overall disease control strategy including biosecurity and vaccination, zoning and/or compartmentalisation following the guidelines of OIE and FAO and to take into account human and food safety issues.Public awareness must be promoted for gaining support from producers and consumers, government agencies and private sector institutions, and other stakeholders.\n",

Application of advanced diagnostics, stockpiling of drugs like Tamiflu along with novel vaccine development via utilisation of advanced tools and techniques and finally judicious vaccination strategies have got paramount importance in order to prevent the disease. The epidemic potential is limited by such measures which ultimately prevent the occurrence of a human pandemic (Pawaiya et al. 2009; Mak et al. 2012). Potential pathways for introducing and spreading disease must be identified by developing a swine influenza biosecurity plan. Prevention of the occurrence and spread of the disease is the best way to deal with the disease as influenza viruses can be transmitted crossing species barrier between humans and pigs (VanReeth and Ma 2012). Human\u2013pig interactions must be considered under biosecurity plan especially when pigs are exposed to persons with illness similar to influenza. Supportive therapy is the primary treatment and a dry, clean and dust-free environment are required by infected pigs. Proper rest must be provided to people suffering from swine flu without their free roaming in public places where there is gathering of numerous people (Dhama et al. 2012). Any secondary bacterial infection must be treated and controlled by antibiotics. Herd treatment involves use of expectorants administered in the water for drinking. In Europe and North America, vaccines are available commercially against H1 and H3 (Kothalawala et al. 2006). Nasal shedding and lung tissue infection along with lung pathology have been reduced markedly by vaccination of animals having exposure to the virus as evident from results of several studies. Pigs aged 5 weeks having clinical disease with infection of the lungs are protected by maternal antibodies from vaccinated sows but nasal shedding of the virus is not prevented. Even though vaccines are available to prevent swine influenza, 100 % efficacy is not proven. Either whole or split virus vaccines are commercially available and adjuvenation and inactivation along with preparation of whole-virus vaccine are done in embryonated egg of hen or in cell lines. Major drawback of such vaccines is that they do not bestow every time cross-protection against emerging subtypes. Autogenous multivalent inactivated vaccines may be prepared in individual farms specifically against the strain of the virus circulating in swine population.",

The newly infected animal can shed the virus till 21 days and OIE has suggested isolation of the infected animals for 28 days and such animals need to be placed 100 m away (minimum) from healthy animals. Personal care must be followed during handling animals. The water and feeds should not get mingled between non-infected and infected animals. Quick diagnosis of respiratory diseases of equines by examining nasal swabs as well as serum samples is necessary for instant control of the disease. However, after quick detection and restriction of the disease in a limited area, it is required to achieve containment followed by eradication by quarantine as well as movement restriction without requirement of vaccination (Wood 2009). Most of the licensed equine influenza virus vaccines available internationally consist of inactivated whole virus of subtypes H7N7 and H3N8, or subunit vaccines (Park et al. 2003) which are given intramuscularly. The duration of protection provided by current vaccines is limited and they have less ability to control infection (Nelson et al. 1998) but if booster vaccinations are given then the disease occurrence and severity can be minimised. Vaccinated dams gives protective immunity to the ponies for the initial period but by 1\u20132 months it declines, so it is essential to protect the young ones using vaccines developed from strains similar to those circulating in the region (Townsend et al. 1999, 2001). The vaccination strategies will vary among horses of different classes and age groups such as foals, breeding mares and stallions, performance horses and recreational horses. Crouch et al. (2004) carried out vaccination of the young horses intramuscularly with the immuno-stimulating complex (ISCOM) vaccine involving the American lineage H3N8 and the challenge studies were done using the reference strain (A/eq/Newmarket/1/93). The vaccinated ponies were significantly protected as there were no evidence on clinical signs and virus excretion on challenge studies.",

However, its efficacy is not always high which may not be due to the vaccine itself, rather because of the frequent antigenic changes in the virus (Horimoto et al. 2008). Commercial licensed, inactivated vaccines for humans against influenza A and B viruses are available, which consists of three influenza viruses: two influenza type A subtypes H3N2, and H1N1 (seasonal) virus strain, plus a strain of influenza type B virus. As per WHO, use of tetravaccine consisting of antigens of influenza virus serotypes H3N2, H1N1, B and H5 is the most promising method to control influenza pandemic (Onishchenko et al. 2007). In March 2012, US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved quadrivalent flu vaccine administered as nasal mist (Traynor 2012), which was reported to be more beneficial than trivalent vaccines as it includes one more influenza B strain (Campos-Outcalt 2012; Barr and Jelley 2012; Block et al. 2012; Ambrose and Levin 2012; Reed et al. 2012). Seasonal influenza (SI) vaccines in immunologically naive hosts may sometimes lead to a different kind of situation in which the generation of heterosubtypic immunity against potentially pandemic strains is actively inhibited (Bodewes et al. 2009). The operational challenges, in rapid production, procurement and deployment, and delayed and non-uniform access to vaccines and their implications during the A (H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009, H5N1 and H7N9, have been described (Jorgensen et al. 2013; Mei et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Live attenuated vaccines to influenza viruses are also commercially available in the market (Belshe et al. 1998; Nichol et al. 1999; Yin et al. 2012) and are found to be more effective due to the induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses (Boyce et al. 1999; Piedra et al. 2005a, b). Different vaccines and different vaccination schedules may be required for populations of different age groups such as paediatric, young adult, adult, elderly adult and pregnant women (Grohskopf et al. 2013). Other approaches to human influenza virus vaccines include cold adapted (ca), temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant or reassortants derived from them or avirulent parents having HA and NA genes from other parents and recombinant vector vaccines (Belshe et al. 1998; Maassab and Bryant 1999), virus-like particles (Galarza et al. 2005; Pushko et al. 2005, 2007; Bright et al. 2007; Quan et al. 2007; Matassov et al. 2007; Bright et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2014a), viral vectors, DNA-based vaccines and universal vaccines (Lambert and Fauci 2010; Shaw 2012). In 2010, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved high dose (4x) influenza vaccine for people aged 65 years and over, who have weak immune response (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010). A number of different approaches have been used for the development of influenza virus vaccines (Kemble and Greenberg 2003; Subbarao and Katz 2004; Wood and Robertson 2004; Neumann et al. 2005; Matassov et al. 2007; Cox 2008; Du et al. 2008; Murakami et al. 2008; Mayrhofer et al. 2009; Friesen et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2014; Huber 2014; Keitel and Piedra 2014; van der Velden et al. 2014). A subunit vaccines against H5 or H9 subtype AIV and infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) using viral protein 2 (VP2) of IBDV as cargo protein to display a 12-amino-acid (aa) immunodominant epitope derived from N-terminal M2 extracelluar domain (nM2e) of H5 or H9 subtype AIV was developed (Tang et al. 2012). An avian live attenuated master strain that may be used for the development of vaccines for epidemics and pandemics caused by influenza viruses has been reported (Hickman et al. 2008). Researchers are putting in efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine that need not be reformulated each year (Du et al. 2010; Shaw 2012; Jang and Seong 2013). The extracellular portion of the influenza matrix 2 (M2) protein and conserved epitopes from the influenza NP, matrix 1 (M1) and HA proteins are being developed as candidate-inactivated \u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018common type\u2019 influenza A vaccine (Fan et al. 2004; Neirynck et al. 1999; Lambert and Fauci 2010). The route of inoculation and delivery system can also affect the outcome of influenza virus immunisation/vaccination (Belshe et al. 1998, 2007; Holland et al. 2008; Wee et al. 2008; van Damme et al. 2009). Safe and effective immunity was reported to be induced by the low-dose influenza vaccines delivered intradermally using microneedles strain that compared well with the full-dose intramuscular vaccination. The microneedle injection device was found to be effective, safe, and reliable (van Damme et al. 2009; Widera et al. 2006; Gorse et al. 2013; Marra et al. 2013). The M2 cytoplasmic tail mutants have been used as vaccines against H5N1 influenza A virus (Watanabe et al. 2008).\n",

It usually takes about 6 months from the time composition for the next season\u2019s influenza vaccine is decided and to produce, manufacture, release and distribute a vaccine that antigenically matches with the new influenza virus strain. The prediction and forecasting of a subtype or strain that may cause the next pandemic is quite difficult or rather not possible as the influenza A viruses display huge genetic diversity of in nature. Therefore, the control of the first wave of a pandemic by existing annual vaccines will not be possible. On the contrary, the administration of the universal vaccine, being \u2018off-the-shelf vaccine\u2019, could provide immediate protection against a newly emerging influenza virus or pandemic strain. A universal vaccine would reduce the severity of disease, enable the host to rapidly clear itself of the virus and decrease the case fatality rate until a specific vaccine against that virus is available. For mass-scale use of these vaccines, highly efficient microbial expression system will be required for the production of universal influenza vaccines in order to reduce the cost. As there are no time constraints for universal influenza vaccines, these can be produced, distributed, dispensed and given to the targets much ahead of the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic strains. In order to generate long-lasting effective protective immunity, universal vaccines development strategy should be such that these mimic the native conformation of target antigens. Current inactivated and live attenuated influenza virus vaccines are effective and induce protective immunity only when the vaccine strains and those causing epidemics are antigenically similar. However, these will not be effective enough and are bound to fail in preventing the emergence and spread of new pandemic or highly virulent viruses containing a substantially different HA protein. Current vaccines tend to induce strain-specific humoral immunity as the antibodies are elicited against dominant epitopes on the globular head of the HA the influenza virus which themselves are under immune selection pressure to mutate by antigenic drift. Universal influenza virus vaccines containing the relatively conserved ectodomain of M2 (M2e) (Kim et al. 2013), M1 (El Bakkouri et al. 2011; Atsmon et al. 2012; Quan et al. 2012; Zheng et al. 2013), HA fusion peptide and stalk domains, NA (Gravel et al. 2010; Johansson and Cox 2011; Quan et al. 2012; Schneemann et al. 2012, Margine et al. 2013; Eggink et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2014a), NP alone or in combination, as recombinants, VLPs or synthetic peptides have been developed which have been shown to induce cross-protection (Kang et al. 2011, 2012; Song et al. 2011a, b; Wu et al. 2012; He et al. 2013; Ma et al. 2013; Girard et al. 2013; Pica and Palese 2013; Vitelli et al. 2013). Various approaches have been used to develop effective universal vaccines against influenza viruses (Fig. 11.1).\n\n",

However, prior influenza immunity may have its effect on the induction of such broadly protective antibodies. It was speculated that the pre-existing immunity produced in response to previous exposure to influenza virus or vaccine may impede the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies; and therefore can only be used in very young children having restricted exposure to influenza viruses or vaccines. However, mice and ferrets having pre-existing immunity to influenza virus produced broadly neutralising influenza antibodies when a prime-boost vaccine formulation, consisting of a DNA vaccine for priming and an inactivated seasonal vaccine as booster, were used. The source of pre-existing immunity whether due to natural exposure to a flu virus or in response to vaccination was inconsequential. These influenza-immune ferrets that had received the prime-boost vaccine preparation, developed broadly neutralising antibodies against the conserved stem region of HA, and showed protection to challenge with heterotypic influenza viruses. It, therefore, opens up the prospects of developing universal influenza vaccines for humans using the conserved stem region of HA despite previous influenza exposure (Wei et al. 2012).",

However, the rapid replication of influenza viruses in the host resulting in the development of clinical signs prior to development of effective cell-mediated immune response that restricts viral replication is a challenge to the design of such vaccines. Therefore, the vaccination with these set of vaccines must induce and maintain T cells in a high effector state without causing immunopathology (Subbarao et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2013). Because CD8+ T cell epitopes are often derived from highly conserved regions of influenza viruses, such vaccines need not be reformulated annually and, unlike current antibody-inducing vaccines, could provide cross-protective immunity against newly emerging pandemic viruses. A single vaccine which contains a combination of several viral immunogens that involves and stimulates different parts of the immune system would be much better than a single immunogen vaccine (Goodman et al. 2011). Identification of an immune correlate of protection and the methods to measure it is another important area that must be looked into for the T-cell-based universal vaccines (Sridhar et al. 2013; Subbarao and Matsuoka 2013).",

The influenza virus haemagglutinin molecule possesses two structurally distinct domains: (i) a globular head domain and (ii) a stalk domain at the membrane-proximal region. The globular head is composed of part of HA1, and the stalk structure is made up of portions of HA1 and all of HA2 (Wilson et al. 1981). The sialic acid binding pocket present in the globular head domain helps the virus to attach to the host cell, whereas the, HA2 fusion peptide present in the stalk domain, causes the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane of the cell. These functions allow the virus to enter the host cell and production of progeny virions subsequent to replication, transcription and translation of the viral genome. Majority of the antibodies produced after influenza virus infection are directed against specific immunodominant regions located in the globular head domain of the HA and are strain specific. However, generation of broadly neutralising antibodies against various epitopes located on the HA stalk domain of the influenza virus have been reported (Corti et al. 2011; Ekiert et al. 2011; Sui et al. 2011; Wrammert et al. 2011).\n",

Identification of broadly neutralising antibodies against influenza A viruses has paved the way for the prevention and control of influenza through development of monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy and universal vaccines. However, two co-circulating, antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses are largely responsible for the annual flu losses. Mice given three human monoclonal antibodies (CR8033, CR8071 and CR9114), were found to be protected against lethal challenge with both of these lineages. However, the nature of these monoclonals was different. The CR8033 and CR8071 antibodies identified distinct conserved epitopes in the head region of HA of the influenza B and prevented the exit of virus particles from infected cells. On the other hand, the CR9114 monoclonal was observed to bind with a conserved epitope in the HA stem and conferred protection against lethal challenge with influenza A and B viruses by preventing pH-triggered conformational change in the HA and subsequent fusion of the virus with the outer membrane of a host cell that is required for virus replication. The protection given by these antibodies against broad range of influenza virus strains indicated that they are directed against relatively conserved epitopes from one flu virus strain to the next. The information derived from these antibodies may help in building strategies for long-term protection against a variety of flu viruses prevailing over a long period of time, based on the development of monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy and universal flu vaccines (Dreyfus et al. 2012).",

An all-inclusive library of billions of flu antibodies, from the internationally and locally collected bone marrow from patients, who during their lifetime, got infected with some important strains of flu, was generated.

Except for the small size of RBS relative to an antibody\u2019s usual grip area, it makes up an ideal target for antibodies. The binding of the targets by the antibodies is done with the help of two arm-like structures, each of which is made up of six protein fingers or loops. Both the RBS and some of the adjoining areas in the head, which differ among various flu strains, have to be captured by a usual antibody. The firm grip obtained by an antibody on this region for one flu strain generally will be lost due to mutation in the virus strain. This is the reason for the shift of focus more on the haemagglutinin stalk than on the head for the development of universal flu vaccine.",

The important function of the RBS does not allow it to change much from strain to strain; and thus variety of different harmful influenza A viruses can be neutralised by C05. Therefore, the C05 and other similar more potent antibodies may be used for protection from severe influenza infections. A universal flu vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies in people should be significantly more effective. Detailed studies on the mechanisms of action of such a broadly neutralising antibody has revealed that the replication of flu virus is inhibited by prevention of the membrane fusion during viral entry by insertion of the heavy chain of these antibodies into a conserved pocket in the stem region of virus HA (Ekiert et al. 2009; Sui et al. 2009).",

            "text": "There are two classes of antiviral drugs: NA inhibitors (Zanamivir and Oseltamivir) and adamantanes (Amantadine and Rimantadine), which inhibit a viral protein called Matrix-2 (M2). These commercial antiviral drugs for treatment of the human flu are available only on the prescription of a medical doctor (Monto 2003; Das 2012; Nguyen et al. 2012). Adamantanes were used initially in the outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997 (Yuen et al. 1998). Amantadine and Rimantadine are effective against many subtypes of human influenza A viruses but not against H5N1 (Li et al. 2004), H1N1 (Parmar et al. 2011), or influenza B or C viruses (Vargese et al. 1983). These two drugs exert their antiviral effect by two mechanisms. First, the release of transcriptionally active ribonucleoprotein complex for transport to nucleus is prevented by blocking the influx of the H+ ions into the core of the virion from the acidified endosome due to its effect on viral M2 protein. Second, the HA maturation during transport from the ER to the plasma membrane is blocked (Hay 1992). However, resistance of these two drugs to influenza viruses has increased to a very large extent and is widespread (Anonymous 2006; Weinstock and Zuccotti 2006; Ilyushina et al. 2007; Lan et al. 2010; Nguyen et al. 2012); and it is due to L26I or S31 N mutations of the M2 protein. The binding of the drug is decreased by S31 N mutation (Pielak et al. 2009). The other two drugs Zanamivir and Oseltamivir exert their antiviral action against all influenza A virus subtypes (including H5N1) and influenza B viruses by inhibition of the viral NA (Tumpey et al. 2002; Moscona 2005a, b; Parmar et al. 2011; Hsu et al. 2012; Vijayan et al. 2012). Oseltamivir can be taken orally, but the optimal effect of zanamivir can be achieved after inhalation or intranasal administration only (Hsu et al. 2012). Various other NA inhibitors viz., peramivir and CS-8958 are also active against the H5N1 virus (Boltz et al. 2008; Kiso et al. 2010a). NA inhibitors can be used to combat pandemic influenza (Democratis et al. 2006). However, the resistance of influenza A viruses (Gupta et al. 2006; Monto et al. 2006; Alexander et al. 2007; Sheu, et al. 2008; Stittelaar et al. 2008; Fleming et al. 2009; Hauge et al. 2009; Burch et al. 2009; Naughtin et al. 2011; Nguyen et al. 2012), and influenza B viruses (Hatakeyama et al. 2007; Sheu et al. 2008) to NA inhibitors has been reported. Oseltamivir resistance can emerge and leads to treatment failure more commonly due to H274Y and N294S (N2 numbering) and less frequently due to V116A, I222L, K150  N and S246  N substitutions within the NA (de Jong et al. 2005; Renaud et al. 2011; Nguyen et al. 2012; Jarhult 2012). Oseltamivir resistance was observed in majority of the human influenza A (H1N1) viruses during the 2008\u20132009 influenza seasons in the United States (Anonymous 2009a) and Australia (Hurt et al. 2012). The S-OIV is susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant to the adamantanes (Anonymous 2009b). Pyrosequencing is used to determine the molecular markers of antiviral resistance in influenza A (H5N1) viruses (Deyde et al. 2009). Therefore, it becomes crucial to monitor the antiviral resistance among the field influenza viruses (Hurt et al. 2012; Nguyen et al. 2012; Jarhult 2012) to inform public health strategies for the control of influenza infections. Studies have been conducted to determine the effects of combination therapy for highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection in mice and cell cultures (Ilyushina et al. 2008; Smee et al. 2009). The antiviral activity of Carbocyclic Cytosine nucleosides against H5N1 has been demonstrated (Chu et al. 2008; Rao et al. 2009). Corticosteroids, when given for a long period of time or at higher doses can cause serious adverse reactions in influenza A (H5N1) virus-infected patients. Antibiotic may be given for suspected bacterial co-infection in patients with A(H5N1) virus infection. Oxygen may be given for correction of hypoxemia (WHO 2007). Apart from these, rest, good plan of nutrition, quitting smoking and adequate exercise will help the body to fight against influenza viruses.",

            "text": "The use of viral M2 inhibitor, adamantanes has been discontinued. The NA inhibitors are facing increased resistance, and the number of such mutants is feared to increase rapidly due to their indiscriminate and continuous use, putting the population at risk to a drug-resistant epidemic (Baranovich et al. 2011; Sheu et al. 2011). The development of increased resistance to FDA-approved antiviral drugs against influenza virus has encouraged a paradigm shift in the strategies for the development of antiviral drugs for influenza virus (Barik 2012; Eyer and Hruska 2013; Hayden 2013; Motohashi et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2014b). Various approaches have been used to develop antivirals against influenza viruses (Fig. 11.3). The inhibitors of cellular factors and host signalling cascades that directly or indirectly interact with virus replication are potential new development candidates (Karlas et al. 2010; Ludwig 2011; Shaw 2011; Muller et al. 2012; Lee and Yen 2012; Loveday et al. 2012; Beyleveld et al. 2013; Edinger et al. 2014; Terrier et al. 2013, Zhao et al. 2013). The cellular miRNAs have been shown to inhibit influenza viral replication by degradation of the viral PB1 gene (Song et al. 2010). The siRNA have been observed to inhibit influenza virus replication targeting the M and NP genes, and thus can be used as potential antiviral therapeutic agent against influenza virus (Ge et al. 2004; Barik 2010; Raza et al. 2011). A cocktail of multiple drugs against influenza virus, which may target two viral functions or one viral and one cellular function, can be developed (Nguyen et al. 2010). New compounds have been screened against various viral targets, such as NA (Kiso et al. 2010b; Ikematsu and Kawai 2011; Ivanenkov et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014), HA (Prasad et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013a), the NP (Kao et al. 2010; Chenavas et al. 2013), M2 ion channel (Balannik et al. 2009), and NS1 (Jablonski et al. 2012). Nucleozin was found to trigger the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation that is required for influenza virus replication (Kao et al. 2010). A mathematical model has been developed for building an antiviral strategy against influenza A infection (Hur et al. 2013).\n",

Defensins and cathelicidins, the naturally occurring innate immune peptides, have been tried as antivirals against influenza virus, though their mechanism of action has been observed to be different (Salvatore et al. 2007; Barlow et al. 2011; Tripathi et al. 2013). The antiviral activity of serum amyloid P against influenza A viruses has recently been demonstrated (Job et al. 2013). A different approach in the form of immunomodulatory therapy against severe influenza has been reported (Fedson 2006, 2013; Marsolais et al. 2009; Darwish et al. 2011; Viasus et al. 2011; Walsh et al. 2011) in which statins or sphingosine mimics have been used with the assumption and hypothesis that the cytokine-storm induced mortality and morbidity will be reduced. Broad subtype-specific DNA aptamers that bind with high affinity to influenza A viruses have recently been described (Shiratori et al. 2014). Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ge et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2013b; Lu et al. 2014b) and plant-based compounds (Song et al. 2005; Hsu et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2013), have also been tried for the treatment of influenza virus. Indian traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda, promotes the immunity of the host and involves the intake of herbs basil (Ocimum basilicum), Ginger (Zingiber officinalis), garlic (Allium sativum), gooseberry (Embelica officinalis), aloevera, camphor and eucalyptus oil (Parmar et al. 2011), Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (Haruyama and Nagata 2012), Red Sea grass (Thallasodendron ciliatum) (Ibrahim et al. 2013), flavanoids of various plants (Costa et al. 2012) and acidic polysaccharides from Coccomyxa gloeobotrydiformi, a green alga (Komatsu et al. 2013). The intake of these herbs may have beneficial effects during influenza infection.",

Rough guidelines for the responses that may be undertaken during a pandemic cycle have been documented (Fig. 11.5). Influenza is classified as a C category agent in potential bioterrorist agent (Rotz et al. 2002). Although the past pandemics of influenza were events naturally occurring but an influenza strain deliberately altered can lead to initiation of pandemic. With the increase in transportation facilities, urbanisation and introduction of new influenza virus subtypes (Starbuck et al. 2012), WHO and health authorities have recognised that the world is under threat of influenza pandemic worldwide, which could potentially have serious impact on health of human as well as animal population (Patriarca and Cox 1997). During pandemics of influenza in the twentieth century, death toll was millions and enormous social as well as economic losses were incurred globally. The forecasting of pandemic influenza virus, its pathogenicity and the extent of susceptible population is very difficult. So, the pandemic preparedness for influenza may help in reduction of virus transmission, and thus reduce the clinical cases and deaths. The preparedness varies from country to country and requires the commitment and input facilities. Planning healthcare for influenza pandemic is quiet tough and is not be possible within days or a month but require multicentric approach involving government, experts from various departments viz., policymakers, legislative persons, human and animal health professionals, pathology laboratories, extension workers and volunteers. On healthcare resource capacities, the AsiaFluCap Simulator can provide evidence-based and illustrative information during future pandemics and help to generally understand dynamics in resource capacities (Stein et al. 2012).\n\n",

The proper coordination among these persons requires appropriate command and control structure. For carrying out essential functions, there is a need to develop standard operational procedures and role. Individual and group responsibilities during a pandemic should be known to all. In order to fill the gaps in knowledge about the influenza pandemic and especially vaccine in poorer nations, extension works should be done where considerable differences in education and access to media are evident (Kouassi et al. 2012; Cantey et al. 2013; Sims 2013).",

Thus, there is a seasonal aspect to influenza virus induced disease in temperate regions. The seasonality of influenza and its effects and impact in the tropical regions is less obvious (Cox and Subbarao 2000). The understanding of the seasonality of influenza may provide greater knowledge about the maintenance, spread and transmission of the disease (Naumova 2006) that in turn will help in putting in place better preventive and control measures. Although many theories based on influenza virus biology, host immunity at individual and population level that are influenced by factors such as photoperiod, nutritional status, crowding, ambient temperature, indoor heating, air travel, bioaerosols and paths of global wind streams (Dowell 2001; Hammond et al. 1989) and many mathematical models such as seasonal forcing, dynamical resonance, bifurcation phenomenon (Dushoff et al. 2004; Smith 2003, 2006) have been described, yet none of them have been able to completely address the mystery of seasonality of influenza (Lofgren et al. 2007).",

The main clinical signs and symptoms of SI are abrupt onset of pyrexia, dry cough, sore throat, rhinitis, headache, myalgia and severe malaise. Except for the high-risk groups where severe complications, pneumonia and death may occur, most other healthy infected adults do not need medical care and natural recovery occurs within 7 days.

The inactivated influenza vaccines can be trivalent (IIV3) or quadrivalent (IIV4). Similarly quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV4) are available for the 2013\u20132014 season (Grohskopf et al. 2013). The antigenically distinct Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B provide only limited cross-protection. Unpredictability of the predominance of B virus lineage during a given season and limited cross-protection led to the inclusion of one strain from each of the two influenza B virus lineage in SI vaccines (Ambrose and Levin 2012; Block et al. 2012; Reed et al. 2012). Also, for the first time, an approved and licensed trivalent recombinant HA influenza vaccine (RIV3) containing purified HA proteins is available in U.S. for use against SI in persons aged between 18 and 49 years (Protein Sciences 2013). It can safely be used in persons who are allergic to eggs.\n",

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is presently evaluating the quadrivalent LAIV.
