In addition, several variants may occur in 5\u201310% of breast cancer cases; these variants are found in less than 1% of the general population [1]. Specific populations, such as those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, have an increased incidence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants.

Men with BRCA1/2 variants are also at an increased risk of developing breast cancer [4], [5]. Thousands of variants have been discovered in BRCA1 and BRCA2, yet only a minority have a known deleterious effect [6]. Genetic testing therefore has the possibility of finding a variant of unknown effect, for which the functional significance is unclear. One recent study found that 10% of women undergoing BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing receive an ambiguous test result because of the detection of a variant of unknown significance [7]. Thus although deleterious variants are known to increase the risk of developing breast cancer approximately fivefold, deciding how to react to variants of unknown effect can be challenging for all involved including both clinicians and patients [8].\n",

Over 300 million individuals of all ages have asthma worldwide [15]. Prevalence estimates can vary greatly by ethnicity; however, from 2% to 33% [16]. In the United States, prevalence ranges from approximately 8% in European Americans to 12% in African Americans and 7% in Hispanic Americans [17]. Within admixed populations, such as Hispanic Americans, even greater variation can be seen when populations are further substratified, with Mexican American populations around 6%, whereas Puerto Rican populations are closer to 19% [17]. Genetic studies have shown that at least some of this variation is caused by differences in genetic variants, with 35\u201380% of the variation in asthma heritability explained by genetic factors [18], [19]. For example, variants in ADAM33 have been seen in European, African American, and some Hispanic populations, but not in other European American, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Korean populations, all of which found different variants in ADAM33 associated with asthma [20] (Fig. 23.1\n).",

For example, the effect of air pollution on asthma case reports is modified by genetic factors as well, showing potential gene\u2013environment interactions. A key measure of air pollution is PM10, the concentration in parts per million of particulate matter 10 \u03bcm in diameter or less, which can penetrate and irritate small airways. PM10 has been shown in multiple epidemiological studies to be an independent risk factor for increased respiratory symptoms including asthma [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Similarly variants in over 100 genes have been associated with asthma in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [20], [26], [27]. Looking at the two risk factors together, however, reveals a potential gene\u2013environment interaction where variants in GSTP1, SOD2, and NFE2L2, all related to oxidative stress pathways, were also associated with increased hospital admissions for asthma-related symptoms during days with high PM10 levels [21].",
