            "text": "Any infectious diseases have been reported in sub-Saharan countries over the past decade due to the inefficiency of health structures to anticipate outbreaks. In a poorly-infrastructure country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with inadequate health staff and laboratories, it is difficult to respond rapidly to an epidemic, especially in rural areas. As the DRC's health system has three levels (peripheral, regional and national), from the production of health data at the peripheral level to the national level that makes the decision, meantime the disease can spread to many people. Lack of communication between health centres of the same health zone and Health zones of the same Health Provincial Division does not contribute to the regional response. This article, an extended version of [1], proposes a well elaborated solution track to deal with this problem by using an agent-centric approach to study by simulation how to improve the process. A new experiment is described by arranging twentyeight health zones of Kinshasa to show how their collaboration can provide unique health data source for all stakeholders and help reducing disease propagation. It concerns also 47 health centres, 1 medical laboratory, 1 Provincial Health Division and 4 Rapid Riposte Teams. The simulation data, provided by Provincial Health Division of Kinshasa, concerned cholera outbreak from January to December 2017. The interaction between these agents demonstrated that Health Zone Agent can automatically alert his neighbours whenever he encountered a confirmed case of an outbreak. This action can reduce disease propagation as population will be provided with prevention measures. These interactions between agents have provided models to propose to the current system in order to find out the best that can help reducing decision time.",

The approach will be based on the current DRC heath system processes to extract relevant actors' tasks. The identification of these actors and their tasks will provide the opportunity to simulate a new system that distributes the entire competences of the old heath system to those actors in order to improve their collaboration and eventually shorten the making-decision time response.

A reactive agent reacts to the stimuli of the environment. Cognitive agents have a more developed intelligence: they manage knowledge and make decisions according to their internal states and according to their perception of the environment. It is provided with autonomous behaviors and some objectives. Autonomy is the main concept in the agent issue: it is the ability of agents to control their actions and their internal states. The agents' autonomy implies no centralized control [14] . When a MAS integrates agents on the fly dynamically during the execution, the system is qualified as an opened one. Otherwise, it is a closed one. One of the advantages of MAS is to model systems where a global description is not possible at any given moment.

First case, MAS approaches are suitable to applications where a complete control is unreachable, the high number of entities or the complexity of entities' behavior make hard to represent the overall system. The second case is related to the monitoring of the epidemics. In a general way, the model of each agents going into action in the system is designed in microscopic level. The environment, the agents' interactions and the social organizations are defined at the macroscopic level. In MAS domain, there are numerous methods to approach the analysis and the design of the software application. The methods come from various domains such as object oriented design, knowledge engineering or reproduction of behavior or natural phenomena. The first methods were AAII [15] which uses an external view (roles services, organization) and internal view (agent design bases on Belief Desire Intention architecture). Cassiop\u00e9e [15] is a bottom-up approach based on natural behavior and DESIRE [16] is based on knowledge engineering. The method Vowels [17] allows obtaining modularity at the level of the multi-agents models by decomposing the problem into four elementary facets. Other method like Gaia [18] extends the concepts used in classical object engineering and provides a microscopic and a macroscopic view of the software system. There are also complete approaches for developing multi-agents systems from the analysis to the deployment by using MaSE [19] or Prometheus [20] . Moreover some models al-low the designer to develop the agent like AGR [19] based on Agent/Group/Role or BDI [21] based on Belief/Desir/Intention.",

At the stage of this research, the simulation's objective is to understand how the DRC's healthcare system reacts in Epidemic diseases. It is a preliminary work before (i) determining metrics to analyze process simulations and (ii) developing modules in embedded systems -phones or tablets-to assist the end-user in the data collection, coupled with the multiagent system. Multiagent-based-simulation (MABS) allows explicitly modeling the behavior of each individual and viewing the emergent system from the interactions between the individuals. Morvan in [37] proposes a survey on MABS and presents several multiagents platforms. In these existing platforms, we have not found solutions which can act as both a simulation system and a tool to end-users on embedded systems. DIAMOND method and its associated simulator MASH -MultiAgent Software Hardware simulation -developed in LCIS Laboratory provided the capacity of testing a method in a tool of simulation [23, 34] .",

To communicate with others, agent uses interaction protocols. We will there-fore express how this behavior will be realized by defining a more sophisticated interaction protocol than query/response.

We considered twenty-eight Health Zone Executive Team in yellow or red, forty seven Health Center in green or blue, RRT in grey one Provincial Health Division and one medical test laboratories (LaboAgent).

As they are autonomous they perform their own tasks like \"cumulate new cases\", \"conduct the investigation on Health Zone # 16\" and manage messages like \"realize analyzes from Health Center\", \"receive sample to_ analyze\" or \"report suspicious case detected\". HZET Agents (#16 and #13) are waiting for a suspicious case message from any HC. Whenever Health Zone Executive Team Agent receives such a message he computes cases and compare with the threshold of disease monitoring to decide the necessity of building a RRT Agent able to investigate in Health Centers around suspicious case in Health Area. The visited health center will turn from green to blue color. RRT Agent could send samples to LaboAgent while searching for new cases in Health Areas. The organization of outbreak riposte could depend on the results from LaboAgent and investigation report from RRT Agent. The agents operate independently: HCAgent transmits data to Health Zone Executive TeamAgent, RRTAgent completes a full investigation, LaboAgent conducts medical testing and transmits results to HZETAgent and PHDAgent which manages all information from Health Zone Executive Team under its supervision. Message synchronization between kinds of agent is done in the agent's decision loop. A protocol with two states is used and implements KQML-like performatives. The four numbers in the message are \"1\" for inform (give information), \"2\" for query information (ask for an information) and \"3\" for request (ask for a task to be done). The agents communicate and achieve their goal by reacting to messages from others or executing their inner task as response to a query.",
