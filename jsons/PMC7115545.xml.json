Page, Yeoman, Munro, Connell, and Walker (2006) pointed out that the recent disasters or crises including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina in the US, the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in the UK, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the Asian countries, and the devastation caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami had a huge adverse impact on international tourism. For example, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the number of international arrivals in Phuket, Thailand's second international gateway, dropped by 67.2% in the first half of 2005, and an estimated 500 tourism companies, employing more than 3000 people, collapsed during these months with predictions of further job losses (Henderson, 2007). Wilder-Smith (2006) noted that there was a drop of 12 million arrivals in Asian and Pacific countries following the outbreak of the Avian Flu epidemic. The World Travel and Tourism Council (2003) estimated that approximately 3 million people in the tourism industry lost their jobs following the outbreak of SARS in the most severely affected countries of China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, which resulted in losses of over $20 billion in terms of GDP.",

Since this Avian Flu is still in its relatively early stages, its impact on tourism has so far been relatively moderate. Nonetheless, it is in our interests to estimate its impact on the tourism sector and to compare it to other crisis/disaster level diseases, such as SARS, so that people can learn from these former outbreaks and be well prepared to limit such a deadly disease's potential damage.",

Faulkner defines a crisis as an event which disrupts an organization's (or destination's) functioning, and of which a large part of its effects can be prevented or reduced by human efforts. On the other hand, a \u201cdisaster\u201d has been used to refer to the situation where a destination is confronted with unpredictable catastrophic change over which it has little control. In this sense, the current Avian Flu epidemic is more of a crisis than a disaster. Meanwhile, the classification and analysis of crises highlights the importance of comparing the post-crisis analysis with the pre-crisis analysis (e.g., Beirman, 2003; Ritchie, 2004; Glae\u00dfer, 2005). Comparing the post-crisis analysis of SARS with the pre-crisis analysis of Avian Flu can form a strategic framework that will combat the transmissable diseases. Meanwhile, Page et al. (2006) pointed out the global spread of Avian Flu was taking place at such a speed that its geographical distribution was changing weekly and that the simulated data in their paper would certainly be overtaken. Thus, this paper follows the suggestion by Page et al. (2006) that updated data be used to analyze Avian Flu.",

Meanwhile, about 200 cases of humans who have been infected by Avian Flu have been confirmed, and the mortality rate of 59% (WHO, 2006) has been high. Avian Flu has a potential global reach in that it can spread through international travel, but a short- to medium-term slowdown could result in the shutdown of the tourism sector (Page et al., 2006). Thus, international tourism will be seriously affected or even restricted to prevent the spread of Avian Flu and pandemic influenza. Brahmbhatt (2005) estimates that the 2004 Avian Flu outbreak in Vietnam led to a 1.8% decline in GDP, where a 5% decline in tourist arrivals could lead to a 0.4% decline in GDP. Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that the global economic influence of an outbreak of Avian Flu could be US $800 billion, equal to 2% of world economic output (Brahmbhatt, 2005).",

            "text": "To estimate the impacts of two infectious diseases, SARS and Avian Flu, on tourism demand in Asia's most affected countries, two important methodologies are adopted in this study. First, we estimate the effects by implementing an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous variable (ARMAX) procedures involving a single dataset, which includes performing unit root tests for dependent and independent variables, constructing the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for dependent variables, and finally estimating the potential impacts by using the ARMAX models. An ARMAX model includes dynamic autoregressive and moving components in addition to theoretical explanatory variables to explain variations in endogenous variables. Bierens (1987) developed estimation and testing methodology for such a model. In the field of tourism, numerous studies have applied the models to estimate the impacts of terrorism on tourism and forecast tourism revenues. For example, Enders, Sandler, and Parise (1992) and Sloboda (2003) utilized ARMAX models to assess the effects of terrorism on tourism for various European nations and the USA. Akal (2004) found the cause\u2013effect relationship between international tourist arrivals and tourism revenues and forecasted the future values of revenues by using ARMAX models. In order to estimate the impacts of epidemic diseases including SARS and Avian Flu on tourism demand in most Asian affected countries, the methodology of the ARMAX model is adopted in our study.",

Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz and P\u00e9rez-Amaral (2000) indicated that international tourism demand is usually measured by proxies such as the volume of earnings generated by foreign visitors, the number of nights spent by visitors from abroad, and the number of foreign visitors. Because people face the potential danger of being infected by SARS and Avian Flu through international travel, travelers might limit nonessential travel to affected countries. Thus, we use the number of foreign visitors, namely the number of international tourist arrivals, to estimate the impacts of the two diseases on international tourism demand. The monthly data for international tourist arrivals are collected from statistical datasets for each country, and the probable numbers of SARS-infected patients and the confirmed human cases of Avian Flu are obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2006). The study period for the SARS case extends from January 2001 to December 2004, while the monthly data for the Avian Flu case covers the period from October 2002 to September 2006. The econometric software applied in this study is Eviews 5.0. Furthermore, the ARMA and ARMAX models are estimated by using nonlinear least squares estimators, while dynamic panel models are implemented by using the panel GMM technique.",

Lim and McAleer (2001) noted that the conventional and frequently-used technique for smoothing time series data is the moving average method. Hence, before estimating the effects of SARS and Avian Flu on tourism demand, the EViews software package is used to implement the process of seasonal adjustment for the tourist arrivals series in order to remove the seasonal effects by means of the multiplicative moving average method.

An ARMAX model includes dynamic autoregressive and moving average components in addition to theoretical explanatory variables to explain variations in endogenous variables. An ARMAX model is an ARMA model for an endogenous dependent variable with additional exogenous independent variables (X). Greene (2000, p. 764) pointed out that the ARMA model is a specific case of ARMAX without explanatory variables, while Harvey (1990) and Franses (1991) considered the ARMAX problems to be an extension of ARMA model because the disturbances are generated by an ARMA process. Therefore, the ARMA model needs to be identified before constructing the ARMAX model. Furthermore, Akal (2004) indicated that the ARMAX model corrects for the shortcomings of the econometric cause\u2013effect technique by using dynamic filters to explain the variations in dependent variables. An explanatory part is integral to the ARMA process in constructing the ARMAX model. The general ARMAX model (Bierens, 1987) can be written as:(1)(1-\u2211i=1p\u03b1iLi)yt=\u03bc+\u2211i=1r\u03b2i\u2032Lixt+1+(1+\u2211i=1q\u03b3iLi)\u03b5t,where L is the lag operator, defined as L\ni\nzt=zt\n\u2212\ni (thus, L\ni\nyt=yt\n\u2212\ni, L\ni\nxt=xt\n\u2212\ni, etc.), \u03b1i\u2208R, \u03bc\u2208R, \u03b2i\u2208Rk,\u03b3i\u2208R are unknown parameters, yt is a stationary-dependent variable, xt is a k-dimensional vector of independent variables, the \u03b5t's are white noise disturbances, p denotes the lag length of the autoregressive (AR) terms, and q represents the lag length of the moving average error (MA) terms.",

If the ARMAX model only consists of distributed lags, the \u03b2i are estimated parameters that represent the effects of the probable SARS-infected patients on tourism demand while S represents the number of the probable SARS-infected patients in Eq. (2). Similarly, the \u03b4i are estimated parameters that represent the effects of the Avian Flu patients on tourism demand while B refers to the number of confirmed cases of Avian Flu in Eq. (3). On the other hand, if both distributed lags and AR terms were to be included in the ARMAX models, the coefficient that determines the impacts in each period would be calculated on the basis of the quotient of the polynomials formed by the distributed lags and by the AR polynomial lags. The process of driving the lag coefficients of the ARMAX model is shown in Appendix A. In addition, all variables included in an ARMAX model must be stationary series. Therefore, if a series is an I(0) series, the variables will be included in the ARMAX model in the levels form. On the contrary, if a series is an I(1) series, the variables will be included in the first-difference form. A detailed account of the ARMAX estimation procedures is given as follows.",

As Franses (1991) mentioned, the ARMAX model concept requires that all dependent and independent variables be stationary series. Therefore, the first step is to implement the unit root tests for stationarity. In order to make sure that all dependent and independent variables in each country are stationary, the Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (henceforth ADF) test is employed to perform the unit root tests. The ADF auxiliary regressions may be expressed as follows:(4)\u0394yt=a0+ryt-1+\u2211i=1p\u03c6i\u0394yt-i+\u03b5t,\n(5)\u0394yt=a0+ryt-1+a2t+\u2211i=1p\u03c6i\u0394yt-i+\u03b5t,where yt is the variable to be tested, and t is the time trend. The first equation represents the no time effect model, while the second one has a fixed time effect. The lag length, i, is chosen using Akaike's information criterion. MacKinnon (1991) implemented a large set of simulations and estimated the response surface using the simulation results, thereby permitting the calculation of Dickey\u2013Fuller critical values for any sample size or for any number of right-hand variables. Therefore, MacKinnon critical values have been used to conduct the ADF test of the hypothesis of a unit root, r=0. In this study, the model for the tourism demand series is set with a time effect, but the ADF regression for the other two series, namely, the probable SARS-infected patients and the number of confirmed cases of Avian Flu, are modeled without a time effect.",

A suitable model is generally preferred since it fits the data without including unnecessary variables.

The estimated initial ARMAX model can be used to test the hypotheses by imposing restrictions on the estimated parameters, and to evaluate the simplified model again. In our study, the simplification of the initial model is based on two criteria, the Wald test statistic for the null hypothesis where some parameters equal zero simultaneously, and R\u00af2.

Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz (2006) indicated that the estimation of the influence of other relevant variables will be overestimated if the impact of previous tourism is neglected. Hence, including previous dependent variables in a dynamic model for studying tourism demand is one of the possible strategies for handling the dynamic structure of consumer preferences where changes in taste are regarded as endogenous (Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz, 2006; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz & P\u00e9rez-Amaral, 2000; Ledesma-Rodr\u00edguez, Navarro-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, & P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez, 2001). In our study, the lagged dependent variables of tourism demand, which are interpreted as being based on habit formation or as interdependent preferences, are included as regressors in considering the possibility of a change in consumer preferences. Two dynamic versions of the tourism demand models are expressed as follows:(6)yit=\u03b71+\u03b72yit-1+\u03b73Sit+uit,\n(7)yjt=\u03d51+\u03d52yjt-1+\u03d53Bjt+\u03d54DIjt+ujt,where yit and yjt represent tourism demand, i refers to SARS-infected countries, j refers to Avian Flu-infected countries, and t represents the time periods. In Eq. (6), uit=\u03b7i+\u03b5it is the fixed effects decomposition of the error term in which \u03b7i is the individual specific effect. The error component \u03b5it is assumed to be uncorrelated with zero and independently distributed across countries. Moreover, in the Avian Flu-infected panel model, i.e., Eq. (7), a dummy variable (DIjt) is included to capture the possible effects of terrorism in Indonesia in October 2005. The variable takes the value of 1 in the above-mentioned month for Indonesia and 0 otherwise.

The Taiwan government has now learned from its experiences of SARS and is setting aside at least a US $0.65 billion budget to protect the Taiwanese people against this Avian Flu and pandemic influenza. It is also expected that Taiwan will have less in terms of loss should such a transmissible disease strike because its preparedness for a single disease can benefit its preparedness for all diseases. However, such preparedness involves relying on knowing the reaction of international travelers to the Avian Flu as shown in this study.",

The estimation results provide useful insights into how epidemic and pandemic diseases affect international tourism. Song and Witt (2000) pointed out that the static regressions of tourism demand models might emerge numerous problems, such as structural instability, forecasting failures and spurious regression. In addition, Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz (2007) indicates if the impact of the previous tourism was neglected, the effect of the other variables considered will tend to be overestimated. So the dynamic structure of consumer preference must be deliberated in the tourism demand model (Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz, 2006). One way to handle the dynamic structure of preferences is to consider taste change as endogenous by including previous tourism demand (Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz, 2006; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz & P\u00e9rez-Amaral, 2000; Ledesma-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2001). Therefore, for a specific country, ARMAX model including dynamic autoregressive and moving components was appropriate as a technique to provide the assessment of the effects of infectious disease on international tourism. Furthermore, dynamic panel models were implemented to estimate the whole regional tourism impacts of SARS and Avian Flu on infected countries.",

Firstly, the significant damage on international tourism demand by using ARMAX procedures were found from single datasets in SARS-affected countries, but not in Avian Flu-infected countries. The negative impacts of SARS on country-specific international tourism range from 175 to 1742 as one more person infected by SARS. The different damage levels for these four SARS affected country might depend upon the government's suppression and reaction strategies. Secondly, Asian tourism demand was significantly reduced by about 403 arrivals for an additional person probably infected by SARS. The figure indicates that the average damage level of Asian SARS affected countries is around 403. However, the estimated results of dynamic panel data models shows that Asian tourism demand is not significantly affected by the infectious illness of Avian Flu.",
