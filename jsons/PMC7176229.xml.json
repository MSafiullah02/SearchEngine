No significant differences between SFV and VSV were seen at the lipid class level, but saturated and mono-unsaturated glycerophospholipids were enriched in SFV as compared to VSV and differences in fatty acid chain length were seen.

Raft association is intrinsically encoded in HA (Scheiffele et al., 1997), the most abundant envelope glycoprotein. The ability of viral envelope proteins to select a cognate lipid environment is uncovered in IFV mutants defective in raft association and budding. Thus, the envelope of a double mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tails of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (HAt-/NAt-) incorporated three times more triglycerides and proportionally less raft lipids, cholesterol and SM (Zhang et al., 2000). Membrane rafts and specifically cholesterol are also involved in IFV entry. Sun and Whittaker (2003) demonstrated that depleting IFV envelope cholesterol by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (m\u03b2CD) extraction specifically blocked the fusion of infectious virus with the PM of pH 5-treated host cells, a process mimicking virus infection by fusion with the endosomal membrane. Similarly, the requirement of cholesterol in the HIV envelope for infection (Campbell et al., 2002; Guyader et al., 2002) correlates with the integrity of viral envelope rafts (Campbell et al., 2004).",

The lipid compositions of HIV-1 and 2 vary with that of the plasma membrane raft domain of their host cells (Chan et al., 2008). For example, the content of DHSM in HIV-1 from a macrophage cell line (MDM) is twice that of the T cell line H9. Similar differences in lipid composition were observed between HIV budding from MT4 versus 293T cells and correlated to membrane order of the virus envelope reported by the dye laurdan (Lorizate et al., 2009).",

HIV accessory protein Nef enforces the raft character of the plasma membrane by significantly reducing polyunsaturated PC species and enriching SM (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2007). Although Nef also boosts cholesterol synthesis (Zheng et al., 2003), cholesterol levels of the PM and the virus envelope are not altered in HIV infection (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2007). Nef is a raft protein (Wang et al., 2000) but cholesterol binding by Nef itself (Zheng et al., 2003) has been contested (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2007).",

TSPO is involved in cholesterol transport to cytochrome P450 which catalyzes the first steroidogenic reaction (Papadopoulos et al., 2007) (see also 10.1007/978-90-481-8622-8_15). The cholesterol-binding groove in a hydrophobic \u03b1-helix near the cytosolic C-terminus was confirmed by mutational studies and modelled (Li and Papadopoulos, 1998, Li et al., 2001, Jamin et al., 2005). Contributions from other TSPO \u03b1-helices to the binding site were predicted (Jamin et al., 2005; Murail et al., 2008) and presented in a 3D homology model based on apolipophorin III, with the five TM \u03b1-helices surrounding one cholesterol molecule docked to the CRAC domain (Rone et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The crystal structure of a human \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), revealed a cholesterol binding site formed by amino acids of \u03b1-helices IV and II (Cherezov et al., 2007; Hanson et al., 2008). These define a cholesterol consensus motif, CCM, conserved among human class A GPCRs (Hanson et al., 2008). For the purpose of comparison to CRAC, CCM is written as R/K-(X)7-10-W/Y-(X)4-I/V/L on one \u03b1-helix, and F/Y on the other. The motifs CCM and CRAC are obviously related by inversion. In three dimensions both motifs may determine similar binding grooves, however, \u03b22AR in contrast to TSPO appears to bind two stacked molecules of cholesterol. Since CRAC and CCM are both quite degenerate, they occur frequently; not every occurrence will be a cholesterol recognition site. A common feature of CRAC and CCM is the \u03b1-helical secondary structure. It is reasonable to muster additional criteria for a cholesterol recognition site of this type, i.e. inclusion in or proximity to an \u03b1-helical amphiphilic or trans-membrane (TM) domain. Table 3.1 cites examples of CRAC motifs in viral proteins reviewed here, in comparison to CRAC motifs of cellular proteins. Also shown are CRAC motifs currently not implicated in cholesterol binding. For example, the influenza A M1 protein exhibits three such motifs, one of which is shown. It is part of the helix six domain which has affinity to membrane and to RNP (Ruigrok et al., 2000). Other short sequence motifs proposed in cholesterol binding (cf. Politowska et al., 2001; Yao and Papadopoulos, 2002) have not been analysed in virus proteins.\n\n\n\n",

A comprehensive discussion of such methods is the subject of 10.1007/978-90-481-8622-8_1 of this book (Gimpl, 2010). The upper half of Table 3.2 lists ways of analysing cholesterol bound to proteins or peptides, purified or in membrane fractions, the lower part addresses binding-site mapping. The \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, where X-ray crystallography revealed the cholesterol binding site belongs to the GPCR superfamily; previous studies on various GPCR have indicated a function of cholesterol in receptor activity (reviewed by Hanson et al., 2008; Paila et al., 2009). The natural variation of the cholesterol-binding site CCM in GPCRs will enable structure-function analysis. In Drosophila metabotropic glutamate receptor, ligand affinity increases with raft association; labelling with 3H-photocholesterol (Thiele et al., 2000) demonstrated the sterol affinity of this particular GPCR (Eroglu et al., 2003). Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) E1 fusion protein was also labelled with photocholesterol (Umashankar et al., 2008).",

Single mutants, where the signature residues Y and R of the CRAC motif were replaced by S and L abolished cholesterol uptake by bacteria expressing TSPO (Li and Papadopoulos, 1998). Transplantation of the CRAC motif into another protein, as done for TPSO and for HIV gp41, substantiated its assignment as a cholesterol-binding site. Photoaffinity labelling with 3H-promegestone of the TPSO CRAC motif transplanted onto Tat, a cell-permeating HIV protein, was competed 1000-times more efficiently by cold cholesterol than by promegestone. The triple mutant V149G, Y152S, R156L of this construct could not be photoaffinity labelled (Li et al., 2001), and the TSPO single mutant Y152S no longer bound 3H-cholesterol (Jamin et al., 2005). A cholesterol-protein binding blot assay enabled the delineation of a cholesterol-binding site in A\u03b2 (Yao and Papadopoulos, 2002). Independent studies by electron microscopy also point to specific cholesterol binding of \u03b2-amyloid (Harris and Milton, 2009; see also 10.1007/978-90-481-8622-8_2). The analysis of the chemical shift of cholesterol carbon atoms in complexes with short peptides containing cholesterol-binding motifs was pioneered by Epand et al. (2003) and applied to gp41 CRAC. These authors also studied a number of sequence variations in short CRAC-containing peptides, discussed in Section 3.2.3.",

The mutation did not interfere with translation, processing and cell surface expression of Env, or with its binding to CD4, but this mutant Env expressed from a plasmid was completely unable to trans-complement the single-cycle replication of an Env-deleted virus. Salzwedel et al. (1999) explored the function of the pre-TM through substitution, deletion and insertion, and constructed a number of CRAC mutants \u2013 prior to the recognition of its cholesterol-binding significance. They found that the pre-TM is dispensable for maturation, trafficking, cell surface expression and CD4 binding, but is required for cell\u2013cell fusion. The substitution WA within LWYIK was tolerated. In contrast, replacing K abrogated fusion. Deletion of LWYI inhibited incorporation of gp120 into virus particles, viral entry and syncytium formation (Salzwedel et al., 1999) while lipid mixing and small molecule transfer were only reduced by 50% (Mu\u00f1oz-Barroso et al., 1999). Analogously, inserting nine amino acids between Y and K inhibited entry (Salzwedel et al., 1999) and fusion, but reduced lipid and small content mixing only by about 50%. Thus, a dysfunctional LWYIK motif appeared to allow fusion pore formation, but arrest fusion pore expansion.",

(2009) shows that function of the LWYIK motif in virus infection is most sensitive to alteration of the CRAC consensus residues L, Y and K, confirming the earlier results of Salzwedel et al. (1999). \u0394LWYIK gp41 remains susceptible to peptides blocking the formation of the six-helix bundle fusion intermediate (Fig. 3.1), which proves a degree of functional independence of these subdomains. Thus, the effects of the mutations may be attributed to local interactions of the LWYIK motif with lipid membranes. Of interest, none of the mutations of the CRAC motif influenced raft association of gp41. In a dye transfer assay between Env-expressing effector and CD4-expressing target cells pre-TM \u0394LWYIK supported lipid mixing, tantamount to hemifusion, but inhibited small molecule content mixing (Chen et al. 2009). The Chen study confirms the conclusions of earlier studies (Mu\u00f1oz-Barroso et al., 1999; Salzwedel et al., 1999), showing that LWYIK is required for the formation and dilation of fusion pores.",

As further controls, calmodulin agarose bound the construct via the Env calmodulin binding site and ConA-sepharose B via gp120-linked mannose. Maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions of gp41 sequences overlapping the pentapeptide LWYIK, even the minimal construct MBP-LWYIK, also attached to cholesterol hemisuccinate agarose, whereas others like the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide, an immunodominant epitope or an endodomain fragment (aa752\u2013856) did not. This sequence spans two CRAC motifs (Table 3.2), which are thus discounted. MBP fusions with complete or incomplete gp41, with or without TM, bound equally, as did a construct containing LWYIR. The study of Vincent et al. (2002) presented compelling evidence of cholesterol binding by the gp41 pre-TM CRAC motif, however, Chen et al.

According to epitope mapping and hydropathy analyses pre-TM was subdivided into short defined sequence elements. N-terminally, pre-TM overlaps the epitope of the monoclonal antibody (Mab) 2F5. Residues 666\u2013673 constitute interfacial subdomain I, 670\u2013676 the epitope of Mab 4E10, and 677\u2013683 interfacial subdomain II (reviewed by Lorizate et al., 2008). Different from the TM segment, which is hydrophobic according to the classical Kyte-Doolittle (K-D) scale, the pre-TM exhibits interfacial hydrophobicity as defined by White and Wimley (1999) (W-W). The K-D scale is based on phase partitioning of hydrophobic side chains, while the W-W scale reflects whole residue partitioning of oligopeptides into the bilayer interface of POPC. For the N-terminal fusion peptide W-W and K-D hydropathy overlap. In contrast, for pre-TM of HIV-1, 2 and SIV the distance between the W-W peak and the transmembrane K-D peak is 15\u201320 residues. Pre-TM interfacial hydrophobicity analysed in a narrow window of 5 aa exhibits two peaks, and mutations eliminating this bifurcation also interfere most with fusion (S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n et al., 2003), e.g. \u0394LWYI, the CRAC deletion of Salzwedel et al.

The validity of these peptide assays with respect to the earlier virus-cell studies (Salzwedel et al., 1999) was underscored by the inactivity of pre-TMp mutant W(1\u20133)A and its inability to cooperate with FP (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2000a, b). Equimolar mixtures of wild-type pre-TMp and FP exhibited cooperativity and an increase in tryptophan fluorescence, indicative of physical interaction. Binary peptide mixtures exhibited higher reactivity to the Mab2F5 epitope of pre-TM (Fig. 3.1), and peptide hybrids exhibited even greater antibody affinity but less membrane destabilizing power. Their binary interaction was interpreted as a \u2018kinetic trap\u2019 stalling fusion, and it was inferred that in the metastable structure of gp120/gp41 the two membrane-active segments mutually mask their hydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 3.1A; Lorizate et al., 2006a, b).",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to monitor the enthalpy of acyl chain melting transition, which increases upon demixing of cholesterol (Epand et al., 2003). As a consequence of demixing, cholesterol crystallites form. Liposomes were prepared in the presence of peptide at high peptide-to-lipid ratio, 5 to 15 mol%. Introduction of LWYIK into multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of cholesterol admixed to SOPC or POPC increased the enthalpy of acyl chain melting transition and concomitantly induced cholesterol segregation into crystallites. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy indicated deeper penetration of the aromatic amino acids into the bilayer in the presence of cholesterol. This was corroborated by the increased quench of tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of cholesterol, of LWYIK (Epand et al., 2003) and LASWIK (Epand, 2004; Epand et al., 2005b), the analogous gp41 sequence of most HIV-2 strains. 13C Magic angle spinning NMR suggested stronger interactions with the cholesterol A ring than with the interior of the leaflet. The complete pre-TMp was actually less prone to sequester cholesterol into domains than LWYIK itself, with LASWIK intermediate (Epand et al., 2005b). Cholesterol sequestration in SOPC/Cholesterol and enhancement of Trp fluorescence in the presence of cholesterol generally were strongest for wild-type CRAC and were diminished most by consensus-violating substitutions (Epand et al., 2006).",

These three variants were also probed in the context of gp41 co-expressed with Tat from a plasmid. The mutation LI had similar effects as other single mutations of the CRAC motif (Table 3.3). A series of double mutants was made to alter the consensus or the intervening residues. Whereas GWGIK and LWGIG inhibited cell-cell fusion by > 60%, LGYGK inhibited only 25\u201330% (Vishwanathan et al., 2008a, b). Epand et al. (2006) also modelled a structure maximizing cholesterol-peptide interactions. All variants partitioned in the acyl chain-polar interface, but LWYIK was unique in that cholesterol OH was both H-bond acceptor to tyrosine OH, and H-bond donor to the lysine terminal CO.

            "text": "Influenza virus has a segmented RNA genome packed as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into a protein matrix, surrounded by an envelope carrying three transmembrane proteins, HA, NA and M2. The eight RNA segments are transcribed and replicated in the nucleus (reviewed by Whittaker et al., 2000). IFV invades the cell by adsorptive endocytosis (reviewed by Smith and Helenius, 2004), which delivers the virus to a perinuclear site (Lakadamyali et al., 2003). Here, the endosomal pH decreases to a threshold (pHtrans) triggering conformational transition of viral hemagglutinin and activation of the proton channel M2. The fusion peptide of HA is unburied and propelled into the endosomal membrane, launching fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane (reviewed by Cross et al., 2001). Concomitant proton influx through the M2 ion channel dissociates the dense matrix (\u2018uncoating\u2019) making RNP susceptible to primary transcription (cf. Whittaker et al., 2000). It is critical that all eight genome segments arrive in the nucleus. Likewise, at completion of the infectious cycle during virus assembly, the eight RNA segments must be sorted into the virus particle. The M2 protein plays a role both in packing and unpacking the genome.",

            "text": "Influenza A M2 protein is a unique, multifunctional protein critical for initiation and completion of the infectious cycle. M2 is a tetrameric class III, single-pass TM protein (Holsinger and Lamb, 1991; Sugrue and Hay, 1991). Figure 3.2 depicts the structural and functional domains of influenza A M2. The 25 amino-acid ectodomain is required for the incorporation of M2 into virus particles (Park et al., 1998) and forms the channel mouth. The \u03b1-helical 19 amino-acid TM segment (Lamb et al., 1985; Schnell and Chou, 2008; Stouffer et al., 2008) defines a minimal proton channel (Duff and Ashley, 1992). However, the following sequence up to at least residue 62 is also necessary for ion channel activity in vivo (Tobler et al., 1999). This amphipathic post-TM domain (D44\u2013K60) comprises a sharp turn and a second alpha-helix according to solid-state NMR of the monomer (Tian et al., 2003). The 3D structure of the tetramer M218-60 elucidated by NMR in solution (Schnell and Chou, 2008) shows the TM and the post-TM \u03b1-helices connected by a loop of residues 47\u201350 (Fig. 3.3). The post-TM includes the palmitoylation site and CRAC motifs overlapping a sequence with predicted affinity to PIP4,5P2 (Table 3.1). Most of the M2 endodomain is involved in virus assembly, required both for the incorporation of M1 and genome packing (McCown and Pekosz, 2005, 2006; Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008).\n\n\n",

            "text": "HA and NA are integral raft proteins (Skibbens et al., 1989, Kurzchalia et al., 1992; Scheiffele et al., 1997; Zhang et al. 2000; Nayak and Barman, 2002) and the budding of influenza virus particles is raft-dependent (Scheiffele et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 2000). Raft trans-membrane proteins typically possess a long TM segment, since raft membranes are thicker than bulk membrane (Coxey et al., 1993; Ren et al., 1997). M2 differs from the large spike proteins HA and NA by its short 19 residue TM segment vs. 25\u201330 for the latter. Compared to HA and NA only a small amount of M2 is extracted into detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) by cold TX-100 (Zhang et al., 2000, Schroeder et al., 2005). Clusters of HA can be visualized in contours of the cell surface by immuno-gold labelling, whereas non-raft mutant HA is distributed more uniformly; these clusters were identified as raft micro-domains and platforms of virus budding (Takeda et al., 2003), which also contain NA and the raft marker GM1 (Leser and Lamb, 2005). Low density of M2 staining did not allow for assessment of its surface distribution in PM contours. In planar plasma membrane sheets HA appears in large 2-dimensional clusters (Hess et al., 2005) and these enable analysis of HA, M1 and M2 co-clustering (Chen et al., 2008). M2 protein co-clustered with M1, however, an alanine-scanning mutant M271 SMR \u2192 AAA (cp. Fig. 3.2) did not. Statistical analysis of co-clustering with HA revealed that this mutant still displayed significant long-range (> 200 nm) association with HA, albeit less than wild-type M2. Moreover, M1 in the background of this M2 mutation also remains associated with HA. This analysis suggested that different sequence elements of M2 are responsible for the association with M1 on the one side and HA on the other, and that association of M2 with HA is not mediated by M1 (Chen et al., 2008). Indeed, M1-binding sites in the M2 sequence are spatially separated from the post-TM (Fig. 3.2). We hypothesized that M2 attaches peripherally to the HA-studded membrane raft (Schroeder et al., 2005). Its short TM domain should lock M2 into non-raft membrane while post-TM lipid-binding determinants form a bridge into raft domains (see Section 3.6).",

            "text": "Cholesterol depletion slows down apical transport via sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts and causes mis-sorting of HA to the basolateral membrane (Keller and Simons, 1998). Cholesterol is also required for the maturation and stability of M2. This was first observed in a heterologous expression system. Extreme cholesterol depletion of insect cells altered the ultrastructure of the Golgi and interfered with cytotoxicity of expressed M2 (Cleverley et al., 1997). We studied cholesterol requirements of the ion channel function on M2 expressed in insect cells in the presence of cholesterol. The proton channel activity of liposome-reconstituted M2 was found to be independent of cholesterol (Lin and Schroeder, 2001). We also expressed M2 protein in E. coli which is intrinsically cholesterol-free. Irrespective of cholesterol content, different M2 preparations exhibited nearly the same activity and susceptibility to the antiviral drug rimantadine (Schroeder et al., 2005). While cholesterol is not directly required for ion channel activity it promotes tetramerization, a prerequisite of ion channel activity (Sakaguchi et al., 1997). Synthetic lipid bilayers of Golgi thickness (C16-C18 phospholipids) support tetramerization of the TM peptide M219-46 better than shorter phospholipids. Inclusion of cholesterol into the bilayers enhanced membrane thickness as well as M2 tetramerization. Judged by Scatchard analysis cholesterol did not directly bind to the transmembrane peptide (Cristian et al., 2003). Full-length M2 expressed in the absence of cholesterol in E. coli exhibited a higher dimer content and lower stability than M2 expressed in insect cells in the presence of serum (Schroeder et al., 2005). The lack of M2 activity in cholesterol-free insect cells (Cleverley et al., 1997) may therefore be attributed to a thinning of the Golgi membranes resulting in the failure of M2 to tetramerize. This is all the more likely as insect cells are cholesterol auxotroph and grow at 27\u00b0C, and their membranes are composed of shorter phospholipids than membranes of cells grown at 37\u00b0C (Rietveld et al., 1999). Introduction of cholesterol also causes the incorporation of longer chain phospholipids into insect cell membranes (Gimpl et al., 1995; Marheineke et al., 1998).",

About 69% of the extracted material coincided with the cholesterol spot. The cholesterol content of purified Weybridge M2 was 0.9 mol per M2 subunit. Sequence-identical M2 protein expressed and purified from insect cells by immunoaffinity FPLC contained 0.5 mol cholesterol per subunit. By prolonged treatment of solid-phase bound M2 with 40 mM 1-octyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside, most but not all cholesterol could be removed (C.S., unpublished). This M2 preparation was captured by cholesteryl hemisuccinate agarose but not by unmodified agarose (Schroeder et al., 2005).

Schroeder et al., 2005) and covers three overlapping determinants of lipid raft binding, palmitoylation at C50, one or two CRAC motifs, and an XIP-like motif (Table 3.1). The M2 protein of influenza A/Udorn 307/1972 (H3N2) (Udorn) lacks R54, K56 and L55 and therefore does not possess a bona-fide CRAC motif, but basic residues are present further downstream of Y52 (Table 3.1). The M2 Weybridge post-TM sequence is most closely homologous to the XIP region of Na/Ca exchangers (Table 3.1) that has specific affinity to PIP4,5P2 (He et al., 2000), a lipid species enriched in the cytoplasmic leaflet of raft membranes (Liu et al., 1998). NAP-22 is another example of a protein predicted to interact with cholesterol via an N-terminal motif similar to CRAC with longer spacers between the L, Y, and K residues (Terashita et al., 2002; Epand et al., 2004, 2005a; Table 3.1). Similar to M2 post-TM, this motif also exhibits a close overlap of elements determining raft binding, myristoylation, affinity to PIP4,5P2, and predicted cholesterol affinity. Epand et al. (2005a) determined that replacing the Y residue of this motif in a 19 residue NAP-22 peptide abolishes its ability to induce a cholesterol-depleted domain in LUVs.",

The substitution R54F that restores a standard CRAC motif into Udorn M2 (see Table 3.1) neither influenced virus replication kinetics in vitro nor affected the formation of filamentous virus or the incorporation of matrix and envelope proteins into progeny virus. Likewise, alanine substitution of the key residues L46, Y52 and R54 eliminating the CRAC motif (WSN M2delCRAC) did not affect WSN replication in vitro, but caused attenuation of virulence. At a dose of 105 TCID50 infection by WSN was lethal, whereas 80% of mice infected with WSN delCRAC survived; mutant R54F had an intermediate phenotype.",

Judged by the behaviour of M2 C50S mutants, C50 palmitoylation was not required for the replication or filamentous budding of the Udorn and WSN strains in vitro, however, the WSN C50S virus mutant was attenuated in mice (Grantham et al., 2009). The robustness of IFV to mutations abolishing palmitoylation and the CRAC motif of the M2 post-TM implies functional redundancy and the need to disrupt more than one membrane-targeting determinant in the post-TM to see effects in vitro.",

Transmission electron microscopy of serially sectioned budding virus particles revealed seven RNP segments of different lengths surrounding the central eighth segment, projecting downwards from the top of the bud (Noda et al., 2006). Once the virus particle is pinched off the RNP segments become indistinguishable. An unknown packaging mechanism sorts the eight different RNP segments into each assembling virus (Fujii et al., 2003; Noda et al., 2006).

            "text": "M2 is implicated in influenza virus morphogenesis, since a specific monoclonal antibody to the M2 ectodomain (Mab 14C2) suppressed the production of filamentous virus; strains unable to generate filamentous particles were not susceptible (Zebedee and Lamb, 1989; Elleman and Barclay, 2004). The antibody clusters the M2 protein on the PM and reduces its surface expression. Moreover, this antibody labelled M2 in spherical but not in filamentous virus particles (Hughey et al., 1995). Resistance to 14C2 mapped to the M2 endodomain, or to the M1 (matrix) protein of A/Udorn (Fig. 3.2; Zebedee and Lamb, 1989), resulting in distinct morphological phenotypes. M1 A41V generates exclusively spherical particles (Roberts et al., 1998; Elleman and Barclay, 2004). This substitution also occurs in high producer H1N1 laboratory strains PR8/34 and WSN/33 that have lost the morphotype switch, which confers no selective advantage for propagation in vitro. Mutations in Udorn M2 (S71Y or K78Q, Fig. 3.2) render filamentous particles less susceptible to antibody restriction but these have a much lower yield of infectious virus and may be defective in pinching-off (Hughey et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 1998). This data implicated interactions between the M2 endodomain region 71\u201378 with M1 31-41 (Zebedee and Lamb, 1989). Physical interaction of M1 with the M2 cytoplasmic tail has since been proven by immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments (McCown and Pekosz, 2006; Chen et al., 2008). In the ensuing mutational studies of the M2 and M1 genes of filamentous Udorn and spherical WSN it turned out that mutations at these and other sites where the M1 s differ, or truncation of the M2 cytoplasmic tail, switch the morphotype (Bourmakina and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2003; Elleman and Barclay, 2004; Burleigh et al., 2005; McCown and Pekosz, 2006; Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008).",

A recent observation directly implicates membrane rafts in this process: Viperin is an interferon-induced protein that disperses lipid rafts (Wang et al., 2007) as evidenced by reduced copatching of HA with GM1, enhanced membrane fluidity, TX-100 extractability and lateral mobility of HA. Viperin binds and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase upstream the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Remarkably, viperin expression also elicits \u2018daisy chain\u2019-like IFV budding.",

The essential functions of M2 in virus uncoating (Kato and Eggers, 1969; Takeda et al., 2002) and genome packaging imply mechanisms specifically incorporating a few molecules of M2 into the envelope. As detailed in the previous sections: (1) The M2 endodomain at and beyond residue 71 physically interacts with matrix protein M1. (2) Although not an integral raft protein, M2 is associated specifically with raft-embedded HA, independent of M1 binding, apparently mediated by determinants for peripheral raft association in the pre-TM (Fig. 3.4). (3) M2 transits with HA through the trans-Golgi to the PM within the same transport vesicles. (4) M2 truncated at residue 70 still packages into virus particles (McCown and Pekosz, 2006), thus, the sequences responsible for M2 packaging include the post-TM. (5) The M2 post-TM is implicated as a factor in membrane fission (pinching-off) as are membrane rafts. We suggested that pinching-off occurs at the fault-line between raft and non-raft membrane at the budding pore (Schroeder et al., 2005; Schroeder and Lin, 2005), where M2 protein concentrates due to its affinity to the raft periphery. This gained further support from an experiment where transient cholesterol depletion, restricted to the process of pinching-off, actually increased the yield of spherical (WSN strain) particles (Barman and Nayak, 2007).",

We suggested that M2 cross-linking would accelerate pinching-off like a draw-string (Schroeder et al., 2005). The role of M2 in genome packaging (McCown and Pekosz, 2005, 2006) and the fact that the genome segments are coordinated to the top of the bud (Noda et al., 2006) suggests that M2 may also prime budding as an initial focus for RNP and M1 assembly.

Alphavirus is a genus of togaviridae, flavivirus a genus of flaviviridae. In cholesterol-depleted insect cells alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) growth is 1000-fold restricted (Phalen and Kielian, 1991), whereas a less cholesterol-dependent point mutant, P226S, is only restricted 40-fold (Vashishtha et al., 1998). This mutation has arisen independently and repeatedly during appropriate selection conditions (Chatterjee et al., 2002). Likewise, the Sindbis alphavirus (SIN) is cholesterol-dependent for entry and egress (Lu et al., 1999). Fusion and infection of insect cells by SFV and Sindbis virus are stimulated by cholesterol.

They have in common flexible domains which undergo conformational transition during the membrane restructuring processes and contain cholesterol binding sites. The type of studies performed and the amount of data available documenting cholesterol binding and its biological function vary greatly. For HIV gp41 cholesterol dependence of fusion is proven, a specific CRAC motif is shown to mediate cholesterol binding of gp41-derived peptides, and mutations to this motif arrest HIV infection at the hemifusion stage. The missing link in the chain of evidence is the demonstration at the virus-cell level that these gp41 mutations abrogate fusion due to impaired cholesterol binding. The influenza A virus M2 protein binds cholesterol which is, however, not required for its proton channel function. Mutation of a potential cholesterol binding CRAC motif attenuates virus virulence. This motif may be one of the lipid-binding determinants linking M2 peripherally to raft microdomains and predicted to play a role in virus budding and fission. Since this hypothesis was first published data has accrued consistent with peripheral raft targeting and supporting the role of the M2 cytoplasmic tail in morphogenesis. The specific role of cholesterol-binding in these processes requires further study. SFV is the first virus for which direct cholesterol binding by the fusion peptide was proven. A second-site locus modulating cholesterol affinity is related to host range and virulence in a number of alphavirus species.",
