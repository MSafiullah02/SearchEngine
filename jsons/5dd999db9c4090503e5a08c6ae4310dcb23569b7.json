The inability to effectively contain the virus indicates that our investment and attention in research, prevention, and treatment development for this type of deadly viruses is insufficient, considering it has been 17 years since the brother coronavirus, SARS-CoV outbreak. The biggest lesson learned from the acrimonious past experiences is that humans quickly lose memory and do not continue to support related research when a pandemic is gone. It is the very time for the government, industry, and private foundations to work together to respond to this wake-up call and to take extraordinary measures to sustain the research support and establish comprehensive research centers. Only this level response may give us a hope to prepare the future and adequately deal with the next potential pandemic caused by emerging devastating viral infections.",

This catastrophic disturbance may serve as a wake-up call for governments, policymakers, philanthropic organizations, healthcare systems, and industries to the reality of extraordinarily dangerous infections caused by emerging pathogens, especially viruses. Admittedly, the government, healthcare institutes, and hospitals as well as medical professionals in China have swiftly taken extraordinary steps and implemented well-coordinated measures to contain the disease by locking down Wuhan city, sharing research results, supplying all emergent materials and sending medical aids to the hospitals at ground zero in Hubei province, particularly Wuhan city. Similar approaches have been applied in Italy, USA, Spain, UK, India, etc. However, the measures taken to control this rapidly spreading disease were insufficient in most of these countries, even with intense efforts, resulting in quick dissemination throughout the world. This is a testament that our awareness and preparation of these types of diseases, even in relatively well-prepared countries such as the USA, Italy, the U.K., Spain, Germany and China, are extremely insufficient.",

When one emergency occurs, we have a knee-jerk response and quickly allocate emerging funding to reduce the potential spread, alleviate the disease suffering, support research on the pathogenesis and develop vaccines and drugs for the new pathogen. However, the dramatic urgency to respond to the pandemic each time has imposed humongous costs, damaged our economy, and disrupted routine life, including study, work, business, sports, and music events.",

There is no sustained funding available for continued research into the disease pathogenesis and development of tools for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. As a result, the number of researchers in the field quickly dwindles after the initial enthusiasm at the disease outburst due to funding shortages, and industries are reluctant to invest in the development of effective vaccines and drugs. As there is no way to predict when the next pandemic will occur accurately, hence financially, a weak business sector cannot help in keeping the profit-driven industries continuing the development of drugs and vaccines. Therefore, when a new infectious pathogen emerges, or an old pathogen evolves, such as the current SARS-CoV-2, we are not well prepared regarding the vaccines and drugs.",

Around 2007-2009, a series of clinical trials of vaccines against SARS showed somewhat efficacy, not convincing results but had to be abandoned because of a lack of continued funding. To avoid the sudden death of promising research towards diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for pandemic causing bugs, we have to do a lot more with an extraordinary, unconventional response from all levels to sustain interest and funding from all sectors, such as government, industry, and philanthropy.",

If we have only had a tiny fraction of this funding but sustainable, humans will have more weapons to combat this type of emerging diseases. SARS-CoV virus is a sister of the current SARS-CoV-2, meaning some drugs for SARS-CoV would be potentially effective for the SARS-CoV-2 and have been quickly used as compassionate treatments (1, 2). Due to the meager funding of research investment, many of the previous vaccines have been abandoned (3, 4) , and no effective vaccines for mass protection are available. Hence, after 18 years of the outbreak (2002), we are still crying for no countermeasures to this very horrible virus.",

Alarmingly, the trend of viral evolution, antibiotic resistance growing, social-political development, economic pattern transition, and human behavior change (much more frequent global travels, human interactions and intercontinental economy dependence than 20 years ago), this type of pandemic is highly likely to threaten and slaughter us sooner and/or more often.",

The international communities thoroughly rethink their policies and allocate sufficient funds even after the initial outbreak to continue at least for 20 years (preferably non-stopping) and sustain the research on these emerging pathogens and their diagnosis, prevention and treatment to better control future infections and avoid pandemics. A large scale of infrastructure, resources, and the task force is desperately needed at state, national.

Through the Biodefense & Emerging Infectious Diseases Program, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has played a vital role in supporting research involving Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens in recent years; however, the level of funding and extent of intention is far less than needed to combat these new pandemic diseases effectively.

We need to vigorously encourage young and established scientists to join these research frames to strengthen the efforts to combat these horrifying diseases.
