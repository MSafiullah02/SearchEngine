Since the first reported case in Shanghai, there have been a total of 131 confirmed avian influenza A (H7N9) infections in humans reported to the WHO, including 36 deaths from February 19 until May 17, 2013 (World Health Organization, 2013a). Most cases progressed rapidly, accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinal emphysema, and septic shock, resulting in disturbance of consciousness and acute kidney injury. H7N9 viruses have not been previously reported to infect humans. Infections with other pathogenic avian influenza viruses including H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2 have previously been reported in China and other parts of the world (Chan, 2009, Cheng et al., 2011, Fouchier et al., 2004, Ostrowsky et al., 2012, Tweed et al., 2004). Since the H7N9 virus is a novel, avian-origin reassortant influenza A (H7N9) virus (Gao et al., 2013) without an effective vaccine, antiviral drugs provide a valuable option for the early containment of highly virulent and/or novel strains.",

            "text": "Currently, two classes of drugs, adamantanes (M2 channel blockers) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as zanamivir and oseltamivir are available for the treatment of influenza infections (Nguyen et al., 2012). However, drug-resistant influenza viruses have been reported, such as the emergence and global spread of adamantine-resistant H3N2 viruses in 2003\u20132004 (Bright et al., 2005) and oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 viruses in 2007\u20132009 (Dharan et al., 2009). Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, all influenza viruses have been found to be generally resistant to adamantines (Nguyen et al., 2012). Fortunately, NAI resistance was rarely detected in H1N1pdm09 viruses (Graitcer et al., 2011). Oseltamivir-resistant mutants are more common due to the rapid development of resistance compared to zanamivir (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010). Recently, a Q136K mutation which reduced sensitivity to zanamivir, but not oseltamivir, was detected in H3N2 viruses isolated from patients not previously treated with NAIs (Dapat et al., 2010). Although several other classes of anti-influenza compounds exist, NAIs are currently the only option in most clinical settings (Moscona, 2008). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) have recommended that all confirmed or probable cases of H7N9 infection under investigation should be treated with NAIs (oseltamivir and zanamivir) as early as possible due to the potential severity of illness associated with H7N9 virus infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013). Among oseltamivir-resistant viruses, the most commonly detected substitutions (N2 numbering) are H274Y in N1 subtypes (Dharan et al., 2009, Graitcer et al., 2011), E119V and R292K in viruses of N2 subtypes (Ferraris and Lina, 2008, Hurt et al., 2009, Sheu et al., 2008), and D198N/F in type B viruses (Ferraris and Lina, 2008). Recently, one cultured virus isolate (A/shanghai/1/2013) was found to contain the R294K substitution (position 292 with N2 numbering; position 294 with N9 numbering) in the NA protein (Gao et al., 2013). Of 14 H7N9-infected patients treated with oseltamivir, the R294K mutation was subsequently detected in two patients (Hu et al., 2013), indicating that there may be a low barrier to the development of drug resistance in H7N9-infected patients treated with oseltamivir. However, increased surveillance of oseltamivir susceptibility is urgently required.",

Compared with conventional Sanger sequencing methods, pyrosequencing can identify established resistance-conferring substitutions much more rapidly. In addition, the assay can be used directly on clinical specimens (such as nasal or oropharyngeal swabs). In this study, we describe an assay using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled with a pyrosequencing procedure (RT-PCR-Pyroseq) to detect the NA residues E120, H276, and R294 (N9 numbering) of H7N9 viruses. Advantages of this assay include a rapid analysis, simplicity and ease of use, and it provides direct results for characterizing oseltamivir resistance in H7N9 viruses.",

Chest radiography showed pneumonia in an upper lobe of the left lung. On March 27 and March 31, a throat swab and sputum were sent to the laboratory of Jiangsu Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (JSCDC) for testing by RT-PCR and the results revealed the presence of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. Meanwhile laboratory tests for other pathogens, including influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2) virus, influenza B virus, and coronavirus, were all negative. Specimens in viral-transport medium were inoculated into Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for virus isolation on March 31, including two or three blind passages. Oral oseltamivir (75 mg) was administered twice daily beginning on March 24, 2013. On March 28th, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Unfortunately, the patient died of acute respiratory distress syndrome on April 24, 2013.",

As such, the amplicon generated from the primer set H7N9-NA-F215 and H7N9-NA-R386-biot (Table 1) was used as a DNA template to analyze changes at residue E120, which is known to confer resistance to oseltamivir. RT-PCR successfully amplified the targeted 172 bp NA gene fragment containing the E120 codon from all the H7N9-positive specimens. An E120V (position 119 with N2 numbering; position 120 with N9 numbering) substitution (GAA to GTA) in the NA gene of H3N2 viruses has been reported to confer resistance to oseltamivir (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010). In our study, the results of the pyrosequencing assay showed that only one viral isolate from the patient described above (which was propagated one generation in MDCK cells) had the sequence GT/AA (Fig. 2A). To further investigate this isolate, its RT-PCR products were tested by Sanger sequencing. The results revealed a mix of nucleotides with T/A coding for the amino acid at position 120 (Fig. 2B), indicating that glutamic acid (GAA) was partially replaced by valine (GTA). High-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing results also confirmed and differentiated the mixed population of GAA and GTA at position 120 from the NA gene, which showed a 54:46 Glu/Val ratio in the cultured virus population (data not shown). Interestingly, the heterogenic mutant E120V was not detected in the matching clinical specimen using either pyrosequencing (Fig. 2C) or Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2D). All of the other H7N9 clinical samples were detected as wild-type E120 (GAA), suggesting that this variant was present in very low proportions (<20%) in clinical specimens.",

            "text": "Monitoring the susceptibilities of influenza A (H7N9) viruses to anti-influenza drugs, especially NAIs, is critical, since these viruses are resistant to adamantanes (Gao et al., 2013). NAIs, most commonly oseltamivir, have been advocated by many countries for use during influenza season. The widespread use of NAIs has caused the emergence of drug-resistant viruses and has become a serious public health problem. For example, Hu et al. (2013) reported that an R294K mutation in the NA gene that conferred resistance to NAIs was identified in two patients infected with H7N9 viruses after antiviral treatment (Hu et al., 2013). In this study, we demonstrated that a rapid and high-throughput pyrosequencing method could be used for the reliable detection of sequences associated with antiviral susceptibility at positions E120, H276, and R294 of H7N9 viruses. Importantly, neither the H276Y nor the R294K mutations were detected in 26 clinical specimens. Previous studies have observed the emergence of two NAI-resistant variants of an influenza A (H3N2) virus, with either valine (E120V) or isoleucine (E120I) at position 120 (N9 numbering), in an oseltamivir-treated, immunocompromised child (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010, Simon et al., 2011). In our study, only one cultured virus isolate from the patient described above with the heterogenic E120V mutation was detected by our pyrosequencing method. The high-throughput sequencing data showed a 54:46 Glu/Val ratio in the virus population (unpublished data). Unfortunately, we did not receive the clinical sample prior to the commencement of oseltamivir therapy. The heterogenic mutation was detected in the isolate after 8 days of oseltamivir treatment. However, this mutation was not detected in the original clinical specimen using either Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Our study provides evidence that although the heterogenic E120V mutation has been shown to emerge following oseltamivir treatment, the detection could be limited to the virus isolate propagated in MDCK cells, where this virus variant may has an apparent growth advantage over wild-type viruses. This phenomenon, though not clearly understood, could be a consequence of different requirements in the NA activity when virus replication occurs in cell culture versus the human host (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010). The pyrosequencing method developed in this study has a detection limit of minor variants about 20%. If virus carried mutations in proportions below the level of detection, false negative result may be occurred by this assay. A more sensitive technique such as molecular cloning may needed to detect very minor virus variants in clinical specimens. Since virus isolation might lead to the selection of mutant viruses that might not fully represent the virus population in the clinical specimen, we should detect NAI resistance among clinical specimens of avian H7N9 influenza virus and avoid culture-induced heterogenic mutations.",

For example, the E120V mutation in the NA gene was detected in cultured viruses but not in matching clinical specimens of influenza A (H3N2) viruses (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010). However, it is not definitively clear whether the mutations arise during passaging, and would irrespective of cell culture, or whether mutations are selectively driven by the specific cell system used. The generation of quasispecies also occurs in infected individuals, suggesting that mutations arise as the virus replicates (Lauring and Andino, 2010). Therefore, the importance of performing molecular testing for influenza viruses on matching clinical and virus isolates obtained on the same sampling date is emphasized.",

When compared to Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing is less expensive and time-consuming for determining the sequences associated with NAI resistance in H7N9 viruses. In addition, the pyrosequencing system has built-in alignment capabilities, making sequence analysis simpler. This assay has a sensitivity of 100 copies of synthetic RNA for all three codons (Table 2). The sensitivity and specificity of the assay should be sufficient for the detected of positive clinical specimens.",
