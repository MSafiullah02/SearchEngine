There is therefore a 2 tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public 3 sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this research 4 article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets 5 and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the 6 progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using 7 descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide 8 a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context 9 of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. 10 We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Na\u00efve Bayes method. We 11 also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% 12 with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This 13 research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, 14 implications, limitations and opportunities.",

The rapid spread of Coronavirus and COVID-19 infections have created a strong need for discovering rapid analytics methods for understanding the flow of information and the development of mass sentiment in pandemic scenarios. While there are numerous initiatives analyzing healthcare, preventative, care and recovery, economic and network data, there has been relatively little emphasis on the analysis of aggregate personal level and social media communications. McKinsey [1] recently identified critical aspects for COVID-19 management and economic recovery scenarios. In their industry-oriented report, they emphasized data management, tracking and informational dashboards as critical components of managing a wide range of COVID-19 scenarios.",

            "text": "There has been an exponential growth in the use of textual analytics, natural language processing (NLP) and other artificial intelligence techniques in research and in the development of applications. In spite of rapid advances in NLP, issues surrounding the limitations of these methods in deciphering intrinsic meaning in text remain. Researchers at CSAIL, MIT 1 , have demonstrated how even the most recent NLP mechanisms can fall short and thus remain \"vulnerable to adversarial text\" [2] . It is therefore important to understand inherent limitations of text classification techniques and relevant machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it is important to explore if multiple exploratory, descriptive and classification techniques contain complimentary synergies which will allow us to leverage the \"whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" principle in our pursuit for artificial intelligence driven insights generation from human communications. Studies in electronic markets have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in modeling human behavior under complex informational conditions, highlighting the role of the nature of information in affecting human behavior [3] . The rise in emphasis on AI methods for textual analytics and NLP have followed the tremendous increase in public reliance on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogging, and LinkedIn) for information, rather than on the traditional news agencies [4] [5] [6] . People express their opinions, moods, and activities on social media about diverse social phenomena (e.g., health, natural hazards, cultural dynamics, and social trends) due to personal connectivity, network effects, limited costs and easy access. Many companies are using social media to promote their product and service to the end-users [7] . Correspondingly, users share their experiences and reviews, creating a rich reservoir of information stored as text. Consequently, social media and open communication platforms are becoming important sources of information for conducting research, in the contexts of rapid development of information and communication technology [8] . Researchers and practitioners mine massive textual and unstructured datasets to generate insights about mass behavior, thoughts and emotions on a wide variety of issues such as product reviews, political opinions and trends, motivational principles and stock market sentiment [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Textual data visualization is also used to identify the critical trend of change in fear-sentiment, using the \"Fear Curve\" in Fig. 1 , with the dotted Lowess line demonstrating the trend, and the bars indicating the day to day increase in fear Tweets count. The source data for all Tweets data analysis, tables 1 Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and every figure, including Fig. 1 , in this research consists of publicly available Tweets data, specifically downloaded for the purposes of this research and further described in the Data acquisition and preparation section 3.1.1 of this study. Tweets were first classified using sentiment analysis, and then the progression of the fear-sentiment was studied, as it was the most dominant emotion across the entire Tweets data. This exploratory analysis revealed the significant daily increase in fear-sentiment towards the end of March 2020, as shown in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "In this research article, we present textual analyses of Twitter data to identify public sentiment, specifically, tracking the progress of fear, which has been associated with the rapid spread of Coronavirus and COVID-19 infections. This research outlines a methodological approach to analyzing Twitter data specifically for identification of sentiment, key words associations and trends for crisis scenarios akin to the current COVID-19 phenomena. We initiate the discussion and search for insights with descriptive textual analytics and data visualization, such as exploratory Word Clouds in Figs. 2 and 4. Early stage exploratory analytics of Tweets revealed interesting aspects, such as the relatively higher number of Coronavirus Tweets coming from iPhone users, as compared to Android users, along with a proportionally higher use of word-associations with politics (mention of Republican and Democratic party leaders), URLs and humour, depicted by the word-association of beer with Coronavirus, as summarized in Table 1 below. We observed that such references to humour and beer was overtaken by \"Fear Sentiment\" as COVID-19 progressed and its seriousness became evident (Fig. 1 ). Tweets insights with textual analytics and NLP thus serve as a good reflector of shifts in public sentiment. iPhone  3281  495  2305  77  218  4238  171 336  111  Android 1180  149  1397  37  125  1050  67  140  41  iPad  75  6  96  4  12  85  4  8  2  Cities  30  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 One of the key contributions of this research is our discussion, demonstration and comparison of Na\u00efve Bayes and Logistic methods based textual classification mechanisms commonly used in AI applications for NLP, and specifically contextualized in this research using machine learning for Tweets classifications.

We observed that Na\u00efve Bayes is better for small to medium size tweets and can be used for classifying short Coronavirus Tweets sentiments with an accuracy of 91%, as compared to logistic regression with an accuracy of 74%. For longer Tweets, Na\u00efve Bayes provided an accuracy of 57% and logistic regression provided an accuracy of 52%, as summarized in Tables 6 & 7 .",

Machine learning and the need for strategic structuring of information characteristics is necessary to address evolving big data challenges [14] . Textual analytics deals with the analysis and evocation of characters, syntactics, semantics, sentiment and visual representations of text, its characteristics, and associated endogenous and exogenous features. Endogenous features refer to aspects of the text itself, such as the length of characters in a social media post, use of keywords, use of special characters and the presence or absence of URL links and hashtags, as illustrated for this study in Tables 2a and 2b . These tables summarize the appearances of \"mentions\" and \"hashtags\" in descending order, indicating the use of screen names and \"#\" symbol within the text of the Tweet, respectively. Exogenous variables, in contrast, are those aspects which are external but related to the text, such as the source device used for making a post on social media, location of Twitter user and source types, as illustrated for this study in Tables 3a and 3b (Table 3 summarizes \"source device\" and \"screen names\", indicating variables representing type of device used post the Tweet, and the screen name of the Twitter user, respectively, both external to the text of the Tweet). Such exploratory summaries describe the data succinctly, provide a better understanding of the data, and helps generate insights which inform subsequent classification analysis. Past studies have explored custom approaches to identifying constructs such as dominance behavior in electronic chat, indicating the tremendous potential for extending such analyses by using machine learning techniques to accelerate automated sentiment classification and the subsections that follow present key insights gained from literature review to support and inform the Textual Analytics processes used in this study [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

In another instance, a study analyzing customer feedback for a French Energy Company using more than 70000 tweets published over a year [23] , used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to retrieve interesting insights about the energy company, hidden due to data volume, by frequency-based filtering techniques. Poisson and negative binomial models have been used to explore Tweet popularity as well [24] . The same study also evaluated the relationship between topics using seven dissimilarity measures and found that Kullback-Leibler and the Euclidean distances performed better in identifying related topics useful for user-based interactive approach. Similarly, extant research applying Time Aware Knowledge Extraction (TAKE) methodology [25] demonstrated methods to discover valuable information from huge amounts of information posted on Facebook and Twitter. The study used topic based summarization of Twitter data to explore content of research interest. Similarly, they applied a framework which uses less detailed summary to produce good quality information. Past research has also investigated the usefulness of twitter data to assess personality of users, using DISC (Dominance, Influence, Compliance and Steadiness) assessment techniques [26] . Similar research has been used in information systems using textual analytics to develop designs for identification of human traits, including dominance in electronic communication [19] . DISC assessment is useful for information retrieval, content selection, product positioning and psychological assessment of users. So also, a combination of psychological and linguistic analysis was used in past research to extract emotions from multilingual text posted on social media [27] .",

            "text": "Extant research has evaluated the usefulness of social media data in revealing situational awareness during crisis scenarios, such as by analyzing wildfire-related Twitter activities in San Diego County, modeling with about 41,545 wildfire related tweets, from May of 2014, [11] . Analysis of such data showed that six of the nine wildfires occurred on May 14, associated with a sudden increase of wildfire tweets on May 14. Kernel density estimation showed the largest hotspots of tweets containing \"fire\" and \"wildfire\" were in the downtown area of San Diego, despite being far away from the fire locations. This shows a geographical disassociation between fact and Tweet. Analysis of Twitter data in the current research also showed some disassociation between Coronavirus Tweets sentiment and actual Coronavirus hotspots, as evidenced in Fig. 3 . Such disassociation can be explained to some extent by the fact that people in urban areas have better access to information and communication technologies, resulting in a higher number of tweets from urban areas. The same study on San Diego wildfires also found that a large number of people tweeted \"evacuation\", which presented a useful cue about the impact of the wildfire. Tweets also demonstrated emphasis on wildfire damage (e.g., containment percentage and burnt acres) and appreciation for firefighters. Tweets, in the wildfire scenario, enhanced situational awareness and accelerated disaster response activities. Social network analysis demonstrated that elite users (e.g., local authorities, traditional media reporters) play an important role in information dissemination and dominated the wildfire retweet network. Twitter data has also been extensively used for crisis situations analysis and tracking, including the analysis of pandemics [28] [29] [30] [31] . Nagar et al. [32] validated the temporal predictive strength of daily Twitter data for influenza-like illness for emergency department (ILI-ED) visits during the New York City 2012-2013 influenza season. Widener and Li (2014) [8] performed sentiment analysis to understand how geographically located tweets on healthy and unhealthy food are geographically distributed across the US. The spatial distribution of the tweets analyzed showed that people living in urban and suburban areas tweet more than people living in rural areas. Similarly, per capita food tweets were higher in large urban areas than in small urban areas. Logistic regression revealed that tweets in low-income areas were associated with unhealthy food related Tweet content. Twitter data has also been used in the context of healthcare sentiment analytics. De Choudhury et al. (2013) [10] investigated behavioral changes and moods of new mothers in the postnatal situation. Using Twitter posts this study evaluated postnatal changes (e.g., social engagement, emotion, social network, and linguistic style) to show that Twitter data can be very effective in identifying mothers at risk of postnatal depression. Novel analytical frameworks have also been used to analyze supply chain management (SCM) related twitter data about, providing important insights to improve SCM practices and research [33] . They conducted descriptive analytics, content analysis integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics on 22,399 SCM tweets. Carvaho et al. [34] presented an efficient platform named MISNIS (intelligent Mining of Public Social Networks' Influence in Society) to collect, store, manage, mine and visualize Twitter and Twitter user data. This platform allows non-technical users to mine data easily and has one of the highest success rates in capturing flowing Portuguese language tweets.",

The least squares algorithm is similar to maximum likelihood estimation when outcome variables are influenced by Gaussian noise [36] .

It has been used widely for document classification since the 1950s [39] . This classifier is theoretically based on the Bayes theorem [35, 37, 40] . A discussion on the mathematical formulation of NBC from a textual analytics perspective is provided under the methods section. NBC uses maximum a posteriori estimation to find out the class (i.e., features are assigned to a class based on the highest conditional probability). There are mainly two models of NBC: Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes (i.e., binary representation of the features) and Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes (i.e., features are represented with frequency) [35] . Many studies have used NBCs for text, documents and products classification. A comparative study showed that NBC has higher accuracy to classify documents than other common classifiers, such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines [41] . Collecting 7000 status updates (e.g. positive or negative) from 90 Facebook users, researchers found that NBC has a higher rate (77%) of accuracy to predict the sentimental status of users compared to the Rocchio Classifier (75%) [40] . Previous studies investigating different techniques of sentiment analysis [42] found that symbolic techniques (i.e., based on the force and direction of words) have accuracy lower than 80%. In contrast, machine learning techniques (SVM, NBC, and maximum Entropy) have a higher level of accuracy (above 80%) in classifying sentiment. NBCs can be used with limited size training data to estimate necessary parameters and are quite efficient to implement, as compared to other sophisticated methods with comparable accuracy [37] . However, NBCs are based on over-simplified assumptions of conditional probability and shape of data distribution [37, 39] .",

            "text": "Logistics regression (LR) is one of the popular and earlier methods for classification. LR was first developed by David Cox in 1958 [39] . In the LR model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function [37] . Using a logistic function, the probability of the outcomes are transformed into binary values (0 and 1). Maximum likelihood estimation methods are commonly used to minimize error in the model. A comparative study classifying product reviews reported that logistic regression multi-class classification method has the highest (min 32.43%, max 58.50%) accuracy compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines classification methods [43] . Using multinomial logistic regression [44] observed that this method can accurately predict the sentiment of Twitter users up to 74%. Past research using stepwise logistic discriminant analysis [45] correctly classified 96.2% cases. LR classifier is suitable for predicting categorical outcomes. However, this prediction needs each data point to be independent to each other [39] . Moreover, the stability of the logistic regression classifier is lower than the other classifiers due to the widespread distribution of the values of average classification accuracy [43] . LR classifiers have a fairly expensive training phase which includes parameter modeling with optimization techniques [35] . K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a popular non-parametric text classifier which uses instance-based learning (i.e., does not construct a general internal model but just stores an instance of the data) [37, 39] . KNN method classifies texts or documents based on similarity measurement [35] . The similarity between two data points is measured by estimating distance, proximity or closeness function [46] . KNN classifier computes classification based on a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each data point [37, 47] . The number of nearest neighbors (K) is determined by specification or by estimating the number of neighbors within a fixed radius of each point. KNN classifiers are simple, easy to implement and applicable for multi-class problems [39, 47, 48] .",

This part of the analysis also develops textual analytics specific data visualizations to gain and present quick insights into the use of key words associated with Coronavirus and COVID-19. The second part deals with machine learning techniques for classification of textual data into positive and negative sentiment categories. Implicit therefore, is that the first part of the analytics also includes sentiment analysis of the textual component of Twitter data. Tweets are assigned sentiment scores using R and R packages. The Tweets with their sentiment scores, are then split into train and test data, to apply machine learning classification methods using two prominent methods described below, and their results are discussed.",

A \"Word Cloud\" is a common and visually appealing early stage textual data visualization, consisting of the size and visual emphasis of words being weighted by their frequency of occurrence in the textual corpus, and is used to portray prominent words in a textual corpus graphically [49] . Early stage World Clouds used plain vanilla black and white graphics, such as in Fig. 2 , and current representations use diverse word configurations (such as all word being set to horizontal orientation), colors and outline shapes, such as in Fig. 4 , for increased aesthetic impact. This research used R along with Wordcloud and Wordcloud2 packages, while other packages in R and Python are also available with unique Wordcloud plotting capabilities.",

We downloaded Tweets using a Twitter API, the rTweet package in R, which was used to gather over nine hundred thousand tweets from February to March of 2020, applying the keyword \"Corona\" (case ignored). This ensured a textual corpus focused on the Coronavirus, COVID-19 and associated phenomena, and reflects an established process for topical data acquisition [23, 50] . The raw data with ninety variables was processed and prepared for analysis using the R programming language and related packages. The data was subset to focus on Tweets tagged by country as belonging to the United States. Multiple R packages were used in the cleaning process, to create a clean dataset for further analysis. Since the intent was to use the data for academic research, we replaced all identifiable abusive words with a unique alphanumeric tag word, which contained the text \"abuvs\", but was mixed with numbers to avoid using a set of characters that could have preexisted in the Tweets. Deleting abusive words completely would deprive the data of potential analyses opportunities, and hence a specifically coded algorithm was used to make a customized replacement. This customized replacement was in addition to the standard use of \"Stopwords\" and cleaning processes [51, 52] . The dataset was further evaluated to identify the most useful variables, and sixty two variables with incomplete, blank and irrelevant values were deleted to create a cleaned dataset with twenty eight variables. The dataset was also further processed based on the needs of each analytical segment of analysis, using \"tokenization\"which converts text to analysis relevant word tokens, \"part-of-speech\" tagging -which tags textual artifacts by grammatical category such as noun or verb, \"parsing\" -which identifies underlying structure between textual elements, \"stemming\" -which discards prefixes and suffixes using rules to create simple forms of base words and \"lemmatization\" -which like stemming, aims to transform words to simpler forms and uses dictionaries and more complex rules and processes than in stemming.",

This aspect, known as N-grams identification in a text corpus, has been developed and studied in computational linguistics and NLP. We transformed the \"Tweets\" variable, containing the text of the Tweets in the data, into a text corpus and identified the most frequent words, the most frequent Bigrams (two word sequences), the most frequent Trigrams (three word sequences) and the most frequent \"Quadgrams\" (four word sequences, also called Four-grams). Our research also explored longer sequences but the text corpus did not contain longer sequences with sufficient frequency threshold and relevance. While identification of N-grams is a straightforward process with the availability of numerous packages in R and Python, and other NLP tools, it is more nuanced to identify the most useful n-grams in a text corpus, and interpret the implications. In reference to Fig. 5 , it is seen that in some scenarios, such as with the popular use of words \"beer\", \"Trump\" and \"abuvs\" (the tag used to replace identifiable abusive words), and Bigrams and Trigrams such as \"corona beer\", \"stock market\", \"drink corona\", \"corona virus outbreak\" and \"confirmed cases (of) corona virus\" (Quadgram) indicate a mixed mass response to the Coronavirus in its early stages. Humor, politics, and concerns about the stock market and health risks words were all mixed in early Tweets based public discussions on Coronavirus. Additional key word and sentiment analysis factoring the timeline, showed an increase in seriousness, and fear in particular as shown in Fig. 1 , indicating that public sentiment changed as the consequences of the rapid spread of Coronavirus, and the damaging impact upon COVID-19 patients became more evident.",

Sentiment analysis is broadly described as the assignment of sentiment scores and categories, based on keyword and phrase match with sentiment score dictionaries, and customized lexicons. Prominent analytics software including R, and open-source option, have standardized sentiment scoring mechanisms. We used two R packages, Syuzhet and sentimentr, to classify and score the Tweets for sentiment classes such as fear, sadness and anger, and sentiment scores ranging from negative (around -1) to positive (around 1) with sentiR [54, 55] . We used two methods to assign sentiment scores and classifications: the first method assigned a positive to negative score as continuous value between 1 (maximum positive) and -1 (minimum positive).",

We created subsets of data based on the length of Tweets to examine classification accuracy based on length of Tweets, where the lengths of Tweets were calculated by a simple character count for each Tweet. We created two groups, where the first group consisted of Coronavirus Tweets which were less than 77 characters in length, consisting of about a quarter of all Tweets data, and the group consisted of Coronavirus Tweets which were less than 120 characters in length, consisting of about half of all Tweets data. These groups of data were further subset to ensure that the number of positive Tweets and Negative Tweets were balanced when being classified. We used R [59] and associated packages to run the analysis, train using a subset of the data, and test the accuracy of the classification method using about 70 randomized test values. The results of using Na\u00efve Bayes for Coronavirus Tweet Classification are presented in Table 6 . Interestingly, though we found strong classification accuracy for shorter Tweets with around nine out of every ten Tweets being classified correctly (91.43% accuracy). We observed an inverse relationship between the length of Tweets and classification accuracy, as the classification accuracy decreased to 57% with increase in the length of Tweets to below 120 characters.We calculated the Sensitivity of the classification test, which is given by the ratio of the number of correct positive predictions (30) in the output, to the total number of positives (35) , to be 0.86 for the short Tweets and 0.17 for the longer Tweets. We calculated the Specificity of the classification test, which is given by the ratio of the number of correct negative predictions (34) in the output, to the total number of negatives (35) , to be 0.97 for both the short and long Tweets classification.

As described in section 3.4, the purpose is to demonstrate application of exploratory sentiment classification, to compare the effectiveness of Na\u00efve Bayes and logistic regression, and to examine accuracy under varying lengths of Coronavirus Tweets. As with classification of Tweets using Na\u00efve Bayes, positive sentiment Tweets were assigned a value of 1, and negative sentiment Tweets were denoted by 0, allowing for a simple binary classification using logistic regression methodology. Subsets of data were created, based on the length of Tweets, in a similar process as for Na\u00efve Bayes classification and the same two groups of data containing Tweets with less than 77 characters (approximately 25% of the Tweets), and Tweets with less than 125 characters (approximately 50% of the data) respectively, were used. We used R [59] and associated packages for logistic regression modeling, and to train and test the data. The results of using logistic regression for Coronavirus Tweet Classification are presented in Table 7 . We observed on the test data with 70 items that, akin to the Na\u00efve Bayes classification accuracy, shorter Tweets were classified using logistic regression with a greater degree of accuracy of just above 74%, and the classification accuracy decreased to 52% with longer Tweets. We calculated the Sensitivity of the classification test, which is given by the ratio of the number of correct positive predictions (22) in the output, to the total number of positives (35) , to be 0.63 for the short Tweets, and 0.46 for the longer Tweets. We calculated the Specificity of the classification test, which is given by the ratio of the number of correct negative predictions (30) in the output, to the total number of negatives (35) , to be 0.86 for the short Tweets, and 0.60 for the longer Tweets classification. Logistic regression thus had better performance with a balanced classification of Tweets.",

Models thus developed with additional data and methods, and using Na\u00efve Bayes and logistic regression Tweet Classification methods can then be used as independent mechanisms for automated classification of Coronavirus sentiment. The model and the findings can also be further extended to similar local and global pandemic insights generation in the future. Textual analytics has gained significant attention over the past few years with the advent of big data analytics, unstructured data analysis and increased computational capabilities at decreasing costs, which enables the analysis of large textual datasets. Our research demonstrates the use of the NRC sentiment lexicon, using the Syuzhet and sentimentr packages in R ( [54, 55] ), and it will be a useful exercise to evaluate comparatively with other sentiment lexicons such as Bing and Afinn lexicons [54] . Furthermore, each type of text corpus will have its own features and peculiarities, such as Twitter data will tend to be different from LinkedIn data in syntatics and semantics. Past research has also indicated the usefulness of applying multiple lexicons, to generate either a manually weighted model or a statistically derived model based on a combination of multiple sentiment scores applied to the same text, and hybrid approaches [60, 61] , and a need to apply strategic modeling to address big data challenges [14] . We have demonstrated a structured approach which is necessary for successful generation of insights from textual data. When analyzing crisis situations, it is important to map sentiment against time, such as in the fear curve plot (Fig. 1) , and where relevant geographically, such as in Figs. 3a and 3b. Associating text and textual features with carefully selected and relevant non-textual features is another critical aspect of insights generation through textual analytics as has been demonstrated through Tables 1\u223c7.",

            "text": "The current study has focused on a textual corpus consisting of Tweets filtered by \"Coronavirus\" as the keyword. Therefore the analysis and the methods are specifically applied to data about a particular pandemic as a crisis situation, and hence it could be argued that the analytical structure outlined in this paper can only be weakly generalized. Future research could address this and explore \"alternative dimensionalities and perform sensitivity analysis\" to improve the validity of the insights gained [62] . Furthermore, the analysis used one sentiment lexicon to identify positive and negative sentiments, and one sentiment lexicon to classify the tweets into categories such as fear, sadness, anger and disgust [7, 54, 55] . Varying information categories have the potential to influence human beliefs and decision making [63] , and hence it is important to consider multiple social media platforms with differing information formats (such as short text, blogs, images and comments) to gain a holistic perspective. The present study intended to generate rapid insights for COVID-19 related public sentiment using Twitter data, which was successfully accomplished. This study also intended to explore the viability of machine learning classification methods, and we found sufficient directional support for the use of Na\u00efve Bayes and Logistic classification for short to medium length Tweets, but the accuracy decreased with the increase in the length of Tweets. We have not stated a formal model for Tweets sentiment classification, as that is not a goal of this research. While the absence of such a formal model may also be perceived as a limitation which we acknowledge, it must be noted that our research goal of evaluating the viability of using machine learning classification for Tweets of varying lengths was accomplished. Finally, we also acknowledge that Twitter data alone is not a reflection of general mass sentiment in a nation or even in a state or local area [8, 11, 32] . However, the current research provides a clear direction for more comprehensive analysis of multiple textual data sources including other social media platforms, news articles and personal communications data. The mismatch between Coronavirus negative sentiment map, fear sentiment map, and the factually known hotspots in New York, New Jersey and California, as shown in Fig. 3 could have been driven by the timing of tweets posted just before the magnitude of the problem was recognized, and could also be reflective of cultural attitudes. The sentiment map presents a fair degree of acceptable association with states such as West Virginia and North Dakota. Overall, though these limitations are acknowledged from a general perspective, they do not diminish the contributions made by this study, as the generic weaknesses are not associated with the primary goals of this study.",

Besides necessary healthcare and medical treatments, it is critical to protect people and societies from psychological shocks (e.g., distress, anxiety, fear, mental illness). In this context, automated machine learning driven sentiment analysis could help health professionals, policymakers, and state and federal governments to understand and identify rapidly changing psychological risks in the population. Consequently, timely responses and initiatives (e.g., counseling, internet-based psychological support mechanisms) taken by the agencies to mitigate and prevent adverse emotional and psychological consequences will significantly improve public health and well being during crisis phenomena. Sentiment analysis using social media data will thus provide valuable insights on attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors for critical decision making for business and political leaders, and societal representatives.",

We also demonstrated the use of exploratory and descriptive textual analytics and textual data visualization methods, to discover early stage insights, such as by grouping of words by levels of a specific non-text variable. Finally, we provided a comparison of textual classification mechanisms used in artificial intelligence applications, and demonstrated their usefulness for varying lengths of Tweets. Thus, the present study has presented methods with valuable informational and public sentiment insights generation potential, which can be used to develop much needed motivational solutions and strategies to counter the rapid spread of \"the trio of fear-panic-despair\" associated with Coronavirus and COVID-19 [13] . Given the easy availability of COVID-19 related big data, an extensive array of analytics and machine learning driven solutions needs to be developed to address the pandemic's global information complexities. While the current research stream contributes to the strategic process, a lot more needs to be done across multiple social media, news and public and personal communication platforms. Such solutions will also be critical in identifying a sustainable pathway to recovery post-COVID-19: for example, understanding public perspectives and sentiment using textual analytics and machine learning will enable policy makers to cater to public needs more specifically and also design sentiment specific communication strategies. Corporations and small businesses can also benefit through such analyses and machine learning models to better understand consumer sentiment and expectations. Our research is ongoing, and we are building on the foundations laid in this paper to analyze large new data which are expected to help build models to support the socioeconomic recovery process in the time ahead.
