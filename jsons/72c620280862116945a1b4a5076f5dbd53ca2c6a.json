This early period accounts for unawareness of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease in a new territory, sub-notification of the real numbers of infected people and the timely introduction of social distancing policies to flatten the spread of the disease. We use two variations of the SIR model and we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing measures. Short and Long terms forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected, suggesting that it is important to test the population.",

While the COVID-19 outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, we could only confirm the first case in Brazil on February 25, 2020. The first known patient in Brasil was a 61-year-old man from S\u00e3o Paulo who had returned from Lombardy (Italy) and tested positive for the virus. Since then, we may confirm 4579 cases and 159 deaths (March 30, 2020) in roughly the entire Brazilian territory. Like in the rest of the world (Adam, 2020) , the Brazilian government response to the pandemic has been the introduction of measures to ensure social distancing, such as schools closure, restricting commerce, banning public events and home office.",

The SIR model describes the spread of a disease in a population split into three non-intersecting classes: Susceptible (S) are individuals who are healthy but can contract the disease; Infected (I) are individuals who are sick; Recovered (I) are individuals who recovered from the disease. Due to the evolution of the disease, the size of each of these classes change over time and the total population size N is the sum of these classes",

However, our paper differs from these works in the following dimensions: (1) Data: Our work focuses in Brazilian data. This is an important characteristic since different countries may present different demographies and we know that the COVID-19 is riskier for older populations that appear with higher proportion in developed countries. Furthermore, the level of nutrition of the population of the country may affect the probability of contracting and developing the disease. The quality of data may vary from developed countries to underdeveloped ones and, in our paper, we do not use data from other countries to calibrate our models. (2) Model: We use variations of the SIR model mentioned above. One of the advantages of the SIR model is the simplicity and researchers have used this model in several successful attempts to model the spread of infectious diseases (Shaman et al., 2013; Berge et al., 2017; Osthus et al., 2017; Khaleque and Sen, 2017) .",

It is worth mentioning that it is hard to know exactly when social distance measures took effect, mostly because there is a variable incubation period of the virus (World Heath Organization, 2020c) (indicate a range from 2 to 10 days) and some initiatives of social distance measures (such as home office) started even before the official implementation of the social distancing policy. In fact, after March 22, 2020, we are able to see in the data two consecutive reductions in the taxes of transmission, depending on the final date that is used for the estimation of the SID model as shown in Figure 1 . So, we define March 23, 2020, as the initial date that we use to estimate the parameter \u03c8. In order to estimate the parameter \u03c8, we keep all model parameters as previously estimated and we also minimize the mean squared error using loss functions similar to the ones defined in Eqs. (5) and (6) depending on the case. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the social distancing policy, we estimate a new value of \u03c8 for each new point of the time series as shown in Table 2 , where the column 2 shows the estimations of \u03c8 for the SID model and column 4 shows estimations of the same parameter for the SIASD model. Although there is a small gap between the values of \u03c8 for different models (SID or SIASD), both columns suggest that the social distance factor \u03c8 is going down, meaning that more people are joining the government policy. According to the models, the transmission rate is reduced to approximately 64% of its original value. Table 2 also presents the impact of \u03c8 on the basic reproductive number.",

(6) using different conditions, we get different results, that is, different peak values for the symptomatic individuals. If the proportion of asymptomatic individuals is larger, then this may be good news since it may represent less pressure for the health care system. But since we do not have enough tests to map the whole population, we need to work with hypotheses. Figure 7 shows the effect of different initial conditions in the ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic and the peak value of symptomatic, that is, we impose the ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic on March 30, then calculate the peak value of symptomatic infected. So if we assume that the number of asymptomatic (symptomatic) individuals in data is larger (smaller) today, the number of asymptomatic (symptomatic) individuals will also be larger (smaller) in the time of the peak, leading to a smaller peak for the symptomatic.",

In these kinds of policies, the two fractions of the population, the one at risk and the other one, present very different behaviors. First, the dynamics of the population at risk behaves similarly to the case with social distancing measures, but with a higher death rate. Second, the dynamics of the population that is not at risk behaves similarly to the case without social distance measures but with a low death rate. Third, since the fraction of the population that is at risk is much smaller than the rest of the population, the number of infected of the total population behaves similarly to the case without control. In fact, the policy's effectiveness is not in reducing the number of infected, but in reducing the number of deaths by confining individuals at risk. It is worth mentioning that the effectiveness of these vertical containment polices depends strongly on the ability to separate the individuals at high risk from the individuals at low risk and on the number of vacancies in hospitals to treat the disease. We may extend our model to explore these type of scenarios and we leave for future work.

To minimize the impact of the initial point assumption and data incompleteness, we repeat the estimation procedure 100 times using random initial conditions. Since this is a difficult nonlinear problem we bound the parameters estimation region. In particular, we use the bounds presented in Table 4 . To be clear, the fact that \u03b2 S = \u03b2 and \u03b3 S = \u03b3 is a consequence of our hierarchical estimation procedure previously described in the \"Results\" section. Furthermore, \u03b2 A \u2208 [0, \u03b2 S ] means that \u03b2 A \u2264 \u03b2 S (Robinson and Stilianakis, 2013) , since the asymptomatic individuals do not have symptoms that may help the spread of the infection.",
