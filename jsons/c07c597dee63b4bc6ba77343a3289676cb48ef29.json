Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the betacoronaviruses, a genus of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. The symptom profile of COVID-19 infections vary, with a dry cough and fever most often reported 2 and resulting in a mild illness in most cases. However, severe illness has been reported as occurring in as many as 20% of laboratory-confirmed infections 3 , depending on population demographics and country-specific testing protocols, with symptoms including acute myocardial injury 4 and acute kidney injury 5 . Two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses are known 6 : SARS-CoV-1, responsible for the SARS outbreak in [2002] [2003] [2004] , and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, responsible for the MERS outbreak in 2012. Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, however, SARS-CoV-2 is widely reported to cause asymptomatic carriage 7 in some individuals, which has contributed to the rapid, global spread 8 , and subsequent radical, world-wide restrictions on daily life to control transmission. The disease now represents an unprecedented global health challenge.",

            "text": "Understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis is a piecemeal process. One process that is particularly well understood is the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, which occurs via two major methods: TMPRSS2-dependent entry and TMPRSS2-independent entry 9 . The first method relies on two human transmembrane proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which mediate coronavirus entry to human cells, have been shown to have strong affinity for the human protein ACE2, which is highly expressed on the surface of different cell types, including lung epithelial cells and type II alveolar cells 10 . Once the viral spike proteins have bound to ACE2, localised TMPRSS2 can activate the viral spike proteins and cleave the cytoplasm-facing domain of ACE2. This mechanism causes the virus' membrane to fuse with the human cell's membrane, allowing the viral genomic RNA to enter the cell, where it can replicate and facilitate the production of new virions.",

In this process, the viral spike proteins bind to ACE2 and the ACE2 receptor protein recruits clathrin, which initiates endocytosis of the virus. Usually, following endocytosis, proton pumps transport H + ions into endosomes, lowering the internal pH, allowing the endosome to begin the process of becoming an endolysosome and breaking down anything within. However, the pH-dependent enzyme cathepsin L present in endosomes are used by SARS-CoV-2 to activate the viral spike proteins, which allow the virus to fuse with the endosomal membrane and release its genomic RNA into the host cell in preparation for replication and production of more virions.",

Given the rapid onset of the pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify new drugs that are able to treat the disease and improve patient outcomes 11, 12 . Developing novel drugs and taking them to market typically takes many years, so the traditional pathways are unlikely to provide a timely treatment for the current pandemic. The time pressures for new treatments make drug repurposing particularly attractive. Drugs approved for one indication (disease) may also happen to be efficacious for another. If likely candidates for repurposing can be identified, the time to approval for a drug can be reduced to just a few months by drawing from the pool of the many thousands of drugs that have already been through the regulatory approval process, and are therefore well-characterised. Identifying high quality drug repurposing candidates is challenging. Many discoveries are serendipitous, for example from observations in clinics and trials 13 . However, with the advent of network approaches to studying biology at a systems level, new computational approaches have emerged that allow a more systematic approach to drug repurposing [14] [15] [16] . Networks are a convenient method to represent drugs, genes, proteins, diseases, etc., and the relationships between them. They support human investigation through visual exploration, while at the same time being amenable to computational analysis, enabling automated and systematic analysis.",

Computational drug repurposing prediction and human curation both require the availability of a variety of data sources that describe the molecular processes in a cell and their interaction with drugs. These data are typically distributed in a range of different data sources and databases and may be integrated after they have been represented as networks to form an integrated network or knowledge graph [17] [18] [19] . Repurposing algorithms that operate over the data can vary from simple pattern matching or network module analysis, through to the application of artificial intelligence [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The output of these algorithms are systematic computational predictions and therefore need human curation, with a range of expertise, to assess their value. Therefore, the computational prediction of repurposable drugs is usually applied in an iterative fashion, coupled with the input of a human expert who is able to verify and generate hypotheses about new repurposing opportunities.",

Antiviral drugs have been the most obvious target since some of these have been shown to be active against SARS. For example, drugs such as Elbasvir are under scrutiny to this effect 42 . Other antiviral drugs, such as Remdesivir, originally employed for the treatment of Ebola, have recently been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 43 . However, there is still a pressing need for more candidate drugs, especially those addressing the abnormal immune response seen in some patients 43, 44 . The wider search for repurposable drugs remains a field under active development. Most of these studies are computational in nature and have resulted in many potential new drug candidates. These studies have employed a variety of strategies including network based analyses. Some of these candidates are now undergoing clinical trials to test their effectiveness 34 .",

We aimed to highlight potential repurposing opportunities that are possibly novel in comparison to those published so far. We also introduce some newer features to our analytical process in an effort to improve accuracy by incorporating measures, which take data quality into account, and to speed up data verification by facilitating multiple curation. Many studies, for example that of Kumar 2020 41 , have employed protein interaction networks to study the relationships between COVID-19 proteins, the proteins they interact with, and the molecular interaction networks in the cell. However, data quality is an important factor in the assignment of protein interactions, and has received little attention in studies to-date. Instead of using a standard protein interaction graph, we developed a probabilistic functional interaction network for human proteins that uses highly curated interactions from BioGrid as a gold standard to produce a weighted protein interaction network, where the weight indicates the confidence of a functional interaction. We then mapped onto this human probabilistic function integrated network (PFIN) the interactions with COVID-19 proteins, discovered experimentally in Gordon et al., 2020 27 .",

The division of labour through network partitioning and crowdsourcing are promising approaches to more rapid verification of results 45, 46 . However, one of the challenges facing this approach is the assignment of appropriate sections of a complex network to each curator. Since we were working with PFINs that included weighted edges, we were able to employ a clustering algorithm to partition the probabilistic network into functionally related subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing COVID-19 protein interactors were then enriched with information from previously integrated networks to add relationships to drugs, diseases, genes, pathways and so on. Each subgraph then represents a unit of the network that was systematically assigned to a curator for analysis. In this fashion, a large scale task is broken down and becomes faster with more curators participating in the exercise. Here we present details of our approach to the development and partitioning of the knowledge network and the resulting predictions for potentially repurposable drugs.",

Indicated for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and asthma, theophylline exerts its activity through competitive inhibition of type III and IV phosphodiesterase 61 . Clustering of the PFIN revealed a cluster of genes, one of which, DNAJC11, encodes the DNA J homolog subfamily C member 11 protein (Q9NVH1), which Gordon et al. 27 reported as interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. SARS-Cov2 E encodes the envelope protein, E, which plays a role in the structure and maturation of the virus 62 . DNAJC11 is a mitochondrial protein which is required for mitochondrial inner membrane organization which associates with the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex 62, 63 . The PFIN suggests that DNAJC11 has a high likelihood of being functionally related to RIC3, which encodes the protein RIC3 (Q7Z5B4) --a protein target of theophylline 64 . RIC3 promotes functional expression of homomeric alpha-7 and alpha-8 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the cell surface and is found in endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus 65 . The relevance of the functional relationship between DNAJC11 and RIC3 is unclear, however the interaction was identified by Affinity Capture-Mass Spectroscopy, which implies a physical binding. It is possible, therefore, that RIC3 complexes with DNAJC11 (although current evidence has them expressed in different organelles) and theophylline could block the binding of DNAJC11 by SARS-CoV-2 E. Interestingly, DNAJC11 has well-conserved orthologues in other species, such as mouse, rat, and dog 66 . In this, the red node is Q9NVH1, the pink nodes are genes, and the blue node is Theophylline. Q9NVH1 is a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp4 protein.",

As described in the introduction, ACE transmembrane proteins have a distinct role in Covid-19 infection 9 . Calmodulin plays a crucial role in regulating ACE2 presence on the cell surface by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 68 . A potential target for decreasing infection and viral loading could, therefore, be the use of calmodulin inhibitors, acting to decrease the association of the two proteins. Without the binding of calmodulin to ACE2, the cells start to shed the ectodomain of ACE2, leading to decreased expression and catalytic activity 67 . Querying our knowledge graph for approved drugs that inhibit CALM1 (P0DP23), we identified 10 existing, approved drugs that are labelled as inhibitors of calmodulin, indicated for a range of conditions including hypertension, seasonal allergies, and antidepressants (full list in Appendix 1A).",

Via the action of renin, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I. In turn, angiotensin I, via the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is converted into angiotensin II. Critically, ACE2 converts angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), an effector of nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation which has been implicated in attenuating acute lung injury 70 . The role of drugs which inhibit the RAAS, such as commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) is controversial, with arguments proposed for both harmful and protective effects [71] [72] [73] . Given that angiotensin II is, itself, an approved drug, it may have a therapeutic use in COVID-19 via the actions of angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin II has already been suggested as a possible therapeutic agent, and is currently being investigated (NCT04332666).",

            "text": "Whilst inhibition of the ACE2 receptor may seem an ideal target for treating COVID-19, as it is required for both major mechanisms of viral entry into host cells, it has been shown that ACE2 is essential for repairing damage to lung tissues. Instead, it may be possible to inhibit TMPRSS2, which could lead to most virus particles entering the host cell via endosomes. If cathepsin L is also inhibited, the endosome-enclosed viruses will be unable to escape, allowing the endosomes to progress fully to endolysosomes and destroy the virus particles. In this way, it may be possible to not only prevent entry into the host cell and subsequent replication, but also reduce overall viral load by enabling the body to destroy SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have suggested that an already approved drug, camostat mesylate, could be used as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor 74 . In this study, through rational querying of the knowledge graph, drug candidates for putative cathepsin L inhibitors have been identified (Table 2) . These candidates are all approved drugs. Two of these drugs, telaprevir and boceprevir, have been used previously to help treat chronic hepatitis C infections; however, both have since been discontinued due to common side effects such as severe rashes, anemia, decreased neutrophils, and fatigue. Sodium aurothiomalate is a gold-containing compound approved for use treating rheumatoid arthritis. This drug is not currently commonly sold due to a difficulty in sourcing sodium aurothiomalate. The final potential cathepsin L inhibitor identified in this study is fostamatinib, which is approved for use against chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Other drug repurposing studies for COVID-19 have also identified this drug as a potential candidate, but as an ACE2 inhibitor 75 . These same studies, however, did not evaluate it as a cathepsin L inhibitor. Based on this and previous studies, it is therefore possible that a combined therapy of camostat mesylate and fostamatinib may aid in treating COVID-19.",

In one of the PFIN clusters (relevant subset shown in Figure 6 ), quercetin was identified as targeting the human protein casein kinase II subunit beta (CK2-beta) protein (P67870, localised throughout the cell), which Gordon et al. reported as being a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein 27 . Two CK2-beta molecules, together with a single alpha and alpha' subunit together form the tetramer casein kinases II (CK2). CK2 acts as a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase, involved in cell cycle regulation, and is implicated in disorders of cell proliferation (e.g. tumours) 88 . Interestingly, CK2 has been found to be stimulated in other viral infections 89 , and has various roles in the infection cycles of different viruses 90, 91 . Further, Gordon et al. suggested CK2 inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for COVID-19 60 , as CK2 downregulates stress granule formation 92 which is associated with enhanced viral replication in other coronavirus infections 93 . Thus, depending on the nature of the interaction between quercetin and CK2, it may be of benefit.",

As in other studies, an integrated dataset was developed, extending a drug repurposing framework developed by Mullen et al. 47 . We aimed to enhance the knowledge network approach through the use of PFINs to act as a framework to guide the hypothesis generation process. The use of PFINs allowed us to scale the data curation process in a systematic fashion, exploiting the combined effort of multiple curators. Our approach could act as a template for future studies, with richer knowledge graphs, the incorporation of algorithmic predictions for drug repurposing and a much larger set of curators. The drugs we identified for repurposing are illustrative of the value of our approach. Due to the rapidly developing nature of studies on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, it is difficult to identify which candidates are truly novel, however, even in instances where candidates have already been suggested by other studies, our approach can still provide additional supporting (or refuting) evidence.",

Further, ethically, there may be socioeconomic reasons for selecting one member of a drug class over another, such as supply and demand or the dependence of a subpopulation on a given drug. However, there are some noteworthy cases where focusing on specific drugs within a class is necessary. For example, fostamatinib has emerged as a drug candidate in a number of different contexts as an antiinflammatory agent, as an EGFR inhibitor, and as a cathepsin L inhibitor, establishing it as a promising candidate.",

Refinement of a large set of drug candidates often requires many person-hours of time to curate, particularly when including time taken to understand the mechanisms / pathways involved. By (1) leveraging a PFIN-based clustering approach and (2) focusing on clusters containing high-confidence interactors with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we were able to reduce the drug candidate search space significantly. Using a crowd-sourcing approach to analyse the clusters allowed individuals to curate sets of drug candidates that were likely to be mechanistically related, providing a logical partitioning of work. Curation allowed us to focus on drugs with additional context (e.g., pharmacological, biological) evidence to support or refute the drugs discussed, thus providing a balanced perspective on the drugs discussed. In future studies, it might be interesting to research systematic and computational approaches to integrating and ranking the findings of curators, perhaps building on larger systems for data sharing and integration such as FAIRDOMHub 95 .",

Firstly, the data sources contributing to our integrated semantic network are limited in scope and could be expanded. For example, the graph includes connections between drugs and their protein targets, but the nature (e.g. \"inhibitory\", \"stimulatory\", \"suppressor\") is not always recorded. Secondly, computational prediction can only ever generate suggestions or hypotheses based on the analysis of the limited data available. Thus, for any drug repurposing candidates suggested, it is critical that these are manually curated by experts in medicine, pharmacology, and human biology. Due to recent concerns over the potential for harm in COVID-19 preprints, we want to stress that this research should not be used to inform clinical practice, nor should people change their behaviour on the basis of it 96 .",
