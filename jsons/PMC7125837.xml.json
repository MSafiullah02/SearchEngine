The pathophysiology of pneumomediastinum was initially described by Macklin and Macklin17 based on animal experiments. Pneumomediastinum could result from the rupture of distal pulmonary alveoli due to the rapid increase in intra-alveolar pressure in the alveoli, allowing air bubbles to travel along the vascular sheaths and connective tissue planes to the mediastinum. Considering this proposed mechanism, we hypothesized that some changes associated with the interstitial lung diseases would exist in the lung parenchyma at the onset of pneumomediastinum.",

The diagnosis of IPF was based on the recent ATS/ERS consensus statement on IPF,18 or a clinicoradiographic presentation believed to be highly specific for IPF.19 Two patient with NSIP was histologically diagnosed.

            "text": "Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is thought to begin with a rapid increase in intra-alveolar pressure, air leaks from the ruptured alveoli and accumulates along the bronchovascular sheath.17 The basic requirement for alveolar rupture is the existence of a pressure gradient between the alveolus and its surrounding structure. The pressure within the adjacent alveoli is generally assumed to be equal, so the intra-alveolar wall should remain intact. However, when intra-alveolar pressure increases or perivascular interstitial pressure decreases, a gradient is created. In our study, the extent of ground-glass opacity and consolidation was decreased at the detection of pneumomediastinum in patients who had received corticosteroids or immunosuppresive therapy for exacerbation of interstitial lung disease. These patients showed various degrees of improvement following drug therapy. In patients with deterioration of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, ground-glass opacity has been shown to correspond pathologically with acute diffuse alveolar damage or active fibroblastic foci.22 In these circumstances, alveolar collapse occurs as a result of structural changes, reduced compliance, or obliteration of alveoli. Re-expansion of the alveolus as a result of reacting to drug treatment might increase intra-alveolus pressure. Thus, pneumomediastinum may occur under such circumstances in conjunction with the existence of a damaged alveolar wall. In addition, heterogeneous or partial fibrosis might produce an area of uneven alveolar expansion in which disproportionate alveolar pressure occurs between alveoli. It is assumed there is an increased risk of rupture in the hyperinflated alveolus.",

They assessed the presence and distribution of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities on CT images at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum, and found that parenchymal abnormalities such as ground-glass attenuation or honeycombing showed a subpleural predominance. In a study of 34 patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, Fujiwara1 identified pneumomediastinum on chest CT scans in 5 patients (14.7%). However, they did not assess parenchymal abnormalities at the onset of pneumomediastinum, and assumed that honeycombing and violent cough were predisposing factors for pneumomediastinum. In our patients, the mean score for honeycombing significantly increased at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum, however, there was no patients with prominent clinical symptoms such as violent cough. O\u2019Connor and Thomas.3 described a case of pneumomediastinum in a patient with fibrosing alveolitis. Fibrosing alveolitis produces area of uneven lung expansion, with hyperinflation and areas of atelectasis. This author assumed there was an increased risk of rupture in the hyperinflated areas of the lung. However, in these previous reports, the mechanism in which the pneumomediastinum arises in patients with interstitial pneumonia was not clarified. On the other hand, Ichikawa et al.9 reported a case of a patient in whom pneumomediastinum occurred in association with hypersensitive pneumonitis, and on lung biopsy, overdistention or disruption of alveoli with obliteration of the respiratory bronchioles was revealed. They speculated that increased intra-alveolar pressure occurring as a result of check valve bronchiolar obstruction induced pneumomediastinum.",

First, there were few pathological diagnoses of interstitial lung disease, because most patients showed comparatively typical CT findings and clinical courses of their respective interstitial lung disease, thus pathological examinations were not required. Second, there was unequable in the period between before and at the onset of pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum might occur before the time of detection on CT scan. Third, the present sample numbers were small for evaluation of differences among various histological types or between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and collagen vascular disease. Those differences might affect the results. Fourth, there is the possibility by except for interstitial pneumonia on cause of pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum is also generated by violent cough or pulmonary function test.30 However, our patients had not suffered from violent cough, and there was no case of pneumomediastinum generation for a few days after pulmonary function test.",

Most patients had no clinical symptom such as violent cough at the detection of pneumomediastinum, hence the changes of lung abnormalities probably causes an increase in intra-alveolar pressure. When pneumomediastinum occurs in patients receiving therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents for acute or subacute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, increasing opacities, which indicate disease activity, have been shown to decrease. Conversely, when pneumomediastinum occurs in patients who did not receive corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, the progress of interstitial fibrosis should be considered.",
