There are three possible causes for this pattern. Although there is substantial literature on immunosenescence in several species of animals (Papp et al.2012; Sidler et al.2013; Youngman et al.2011; Zerofsky et al.2005), the assertion that immunosenescence forms the foundation for infectious disease in elderly humans, according to Schneider (1983), \u2018\u2026lacks a firm scientific foundation\u2019. Although over the last four decades, substantial literature on the molecular and cellular aspects of immunosenescence has been added, many fundamental questions about the evolution of these mechanisms, its relevance to aging and health, even a precise definition of immunosenescence are under substantial haze and debate (Fulop et al.2018; Pawelec 2018). Alternatively, it is possible that a decline in the overall physiological capacity increases morbidity and mortality at the same level of infection. The third possible cause, largely overlooked by medicine, is that the opportunistic pathogens associated with the body evolve within the lifetime of an individual to overcome its resistance mechanisms. Evolutionary biologists have recognized this imbalance in the host\u2013parasite co-evolution. Pathogens have an upper hand in the host\u2013parasite co-evolution owing to their faster rate of evolution. Pathogen evolution within the lifetime of an individual is recognized to play a role in the evolution of sex (Hamilton 1980) and the evolution of host aging (Ulfat et al.2017).",

However, since there are alternative explanations for an increase in opportunistic infections (hypothesis (iii) stated below), they cannot be taken to support this hypothesis. A significant increase in the incidence of externally acquired infections is required to support this hypothesis. (ii) Age-related physiological deterioration is expected to increase the morbidity and mortality among the infected population. Alternatively, a significantly greater increase in the morbidity-mortality in comparison with the increase in incidence can be taken as a support to this hypothesis.

Known childhood infections, sexually transmitted infections, zoonotic and vector borne infections were excluded.

Incidence data were pooled only for looking at the quantitative trends (figure 1).

This normalization allowed comparison across pathogens with widely differing incidences. The significance of the trend in each of the individual datasets was tested using non-parametric correlations since the trends were typically nonlinear. Data on the same population but at different years were considered as different sets. If male/female incidence was reported separately, they were analysed separately. We avoided the childhood data (age <20) in analysing trends so as to avoid complications due to childhood immunity. The consistency in the age trend was analysed using Spearman\u2019s Rho correlation using Excel 2007 and Prism 5. In addition to considering the significance of individual Rho at the significance level of 0.05, we also looked at how many datasets had positive or negative Rho values to test consistency in the trends across datasets. This was particularly important since in some datasets: only two age classes were recognized, and so individual Rho calculations were meaningless. For example, in opportunistic E. coli infections the data by Flasche et al. (2011) had only two age groups but there were 5 such datasets and all of them had an increasing trend. Therefore, although we could not test individual trends for significance, the consistency across datasets was tested to be non-random by a chi square test. At the third level, we also looked at the total number of negative and positive trends in group 1 versus group 2 pathogens. This analysis, being non-parametric, does not give a quantitative idea of the fold increase in incidence with age. The fold change in incidence in the pooled data was represented in age trend diagram (figure 1) and calculated as the ratio of the incidence per 100,000 in the age class over 60 s to the incidence in the age class covering the age 20.",

In one, consisting of 10 species of pathogens and 14 pooled datasets, the incidence invariably increased with age. Between the age groups covering the 20s and over-60s, the increase was remarkable ranging from 2.28-fold to 28-fold. In the other pattern followed by 8 species and 12 pooled datasets, there was a significant negative trend in 6 with a 50% to 95% decrease in incidence between the 20 and over-60 age groups. The two patterns corresponded very closely with the two groups in table 1. All pathogens of group 1 showed a positive incidence trend with age. For two datasets, data on only two age groups relevant to our question was available.

Out of 58 datasets for group 2 pathogens, 46 trends were negative, 32 being individually significant. Out of the 12 positive trends, only 3 were individually significant. Out of 9 pathogens, 6 had significantly decreasing age incidence curves. Influenza had a mixed trend (8 negative and 7 positive Rho values), cholera had 1 significant negative and 4 non-significant positive Rho values, and coronavirus had 3 negative trends but none significant. Thus, collectively group 1 pathogens, having opportunity to evolve on the host body, had a predominantly increasing age incidence trend, and group 2 pathogens, not having such opportunity, had predominantly decreasing one. This can be best viewed collectively in the frequency distribution of all Rho values which lie on the positive extreme for group 1 pathogens and mostly on the negative side for group 2 (figure 2).",

For any pathogen for which we had multiple sources of data, the trends were very similar across populations, gender and years, with the only possible exception of influenza and cholera. The predominant trends of these 20 pathogen groups are consistent with the pathogen evolution hypothesis. As an alternative to evolution on individual host body, one can possibly argue that some of the opportunistic pathogens induce immunosenescence in the host (Aguilera et al.2018), and therefore their incidence increases with age. However, if they induce general immunosenescence, the host susceptibility to all kinds of infections should increase. The failure to increase the incidence of externally acquired pathogens makes this interpretation unlikely.",

Similarly, normalization of blood sugar failed to arrest complications of diabetes in many trials (NICE Trial 2008; ACCORD 2008).

We excluded sexually transmitted infections and vector-borne infections where a change in exposure with age is more likely. For airborne pathogens, the exposure is expected to be more homogeneous in a population but we do not see any consistent age-related increase in such infections. Quantitatively, we see a 10- to 30-fold rise in the incidence of 5 to 6 group 1 pathogens, for equal number of group 2 pathogens, there is a decline up to one-tenth in the incidence (figure 1). If the difference in exposure was to account for it, a 100- to 300-fold difference in exposure is required. In the absence of data on exposure level, this explanation remains weak although it might explain a small part of the trend. The epidemiological patterns do not falsify the immunosenescence hypothesis but show that immunosenescence is not strong enough to overpower the other age-related factors that might decrease the age-specific incidence.",

This imbalance in the host\u2013parasite co-evolution is thought to be a major selective force in the evolution of sex and that of aging (Hamilton 1980; Ulfat et al.2017). However, evolution of any member of the microbiota within the lifetime of an individual has not yet been demonstrated. We give epidemiological evidence in support of within host lifetime evolution for the first time. A corollary of increased incidence of opportunistic infections is that evolving opportunistic pathogens contribute to the aging process itself both in physiological time and in evolutionary time, and many mechanisms involved in aging are triggered by opportunistic infections (Aguilera et al.2018; Ulfat et al.2017). Thus, the cause\u2013effect relationship might actually be inverted. It may not be old age causing infections but the evolving pathogens causing aging. It may not be a coincidence that after the use of antibiotics, which can disturb the course of evolution of the opportunistic pathogens, human life expectancy started increasing dramatically. A more systematic exploration of the evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host has the potential not only to understand the mystery of aging but also to improve infection management at a global level.\n",
