Most observers consider colds to include symptoms of rhinitis with variable degrees of pharyngitis, but the major associated symptoms include nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough and hoarse voice. Patients frequently report chills, but significant high temperature is unusual. Colds are usually self-limiting to previously healthy individuals, but there are also recognised complications such as secondary bacterial infections, exacerbations of asthma [1], chronic obstructive airways disease [2] and cystic fibrosis [3], [4], [5] despite the benign nature of the illness in the majority of cases, it is still a significant economic burden on society. It leads to an increase in consultations with clinicians, increased absence from school and work and subsequently causes loss of earnings.",

Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are spread by direct hand contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces. This is followed by self-inoculation of virus into the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva [6]. Airborne transmission of rhinovirus is also possible, but this depends on the duration of exposure to infected individuals [7]. Transmission of parainfluenza virus (PIV) is by direct person-to-person contact or by large particle aerosol spread. The high rate of infection in childhood, coupled with the frequency of reinfection, suggests that they spread from person to person. There is evidence to suggest that the infectious dose of PIV is small, as two-thirds of volunteers developed flu-like symptoms following low-titre PIV intranasal challenge [8]. RSV is spread by infected respiratory secretions. The major route of transmission appears to be by large particle aerosol or direct contact with self-inoculation. Spread requires either close contact with the infected individual or contamination of the hands followed by introduction into conjunctiva. Influenza tends to spread by small-particle aerosols [9]. The relative efficacy of the various transmission routes under natural conditions for each virus is unknown.",

An important feature of coronavirus infection is the short-lived immunity, resulting in a high reinfection rate [21]. The mode of transmission of coronavirus is most likely due to aerosol inhalation. However, it does not grow well at all in cell culture, and therefore, its virology is not fully appreciated. Recently, a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been proposed as the cause for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [22]. The virus induces symptoms of atypical pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from similar syndromes. The severity is such that a 15% mortality rate has been reported. No treatment has yet been identified as reliably successful. Transmission is by droplet spread, requiring close contact. Stringent infection control precautions in health care institutions, broad isolation measures in affected communities and international surveillance with barrier restrictions to travel have led to termination of the epidemic. As of July 11, 2003, 8437 people in 32 countries had been affected, with 813 deaths reported [23].",

First, influenza viruses are able to produce new strains for which most of the population lack immunity, leading to worldwide outbreaks. The unique feature of antigenic variation is referred to as antigenic shift or drift. Second, a recent outbreak in humans of the lethal H5N1 influenza subtype suggested that direct transmission between humans and infected birds without an intermediate host is possible [26]. This avian influenza subtype caused high mortality, killing 70\u2013100% of chicken and also 6 humans [27].

Seroprevalence studies show that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years, that 25% of children by age 1 year have antibodies to the virus and that by age 5 years virtually all are seropositive [34]. Analysis of the amplified sequences showed two clusters of HMPV [35]. The clinical manifestation of HMPV can vary from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe infections requiring hospital admissions. This clinical picture is indistinguishable form that of other respiratory viruses. Coinfection of HMPV with other respiratory viruses is uncommon [36], and its role in human respiratory infections is still poorly understood.

To complicate matters, pharyngitis and sinusitis can also be caused by bacterial infections.

Determination of the aetiology of virus infections becomes increasingly essential with the introduction of new antivirals. The optional use of these new therapeutic options is problematic because all these drugs are virus specific. Some therapies are initiated on the basis of a presumptive diagnosis; a specific diagnosis may be important to confirm the initial impression and to determine the length of time for treatment. Conversely, viral detection is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

In contrast, the collection of a nasal swab is simple, painless and quick, and it does not require special equipment and skilled personnel.

IFA can be divided into direct and indirect methods. Direct immunofluorescence utilises a fluorochrome-labelled antibody that is specific to viral proteins or antigens. It involves fixing the specimens containing viral materials onto a slide so that virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with the fluorochrome can bind to the antigen. Following the addition of a substrate, a colour change with the fluorochrome can be induced, which in turn can be detected by a fluorescence microscope. Indirect immunofluoroscence uses an unlabelled monoclonal antibody that binds to the viral antigen. It is then washed away, and any bound monoclonal antibody is detected with a labelled anti-mouse antibody. The use of multiple antibodies can, in theory, improve the sensitivity of the detection because multiple conjugate molecules can attach to virus-specific antibodies. ELISA is very similar to IFA; however, instead of using a fluorescent label, an enzyme label is used. This assay utilises a double antibody sandwich. A \u2018capture\u2019 antibody specific for the viral antigen being sought is bound to a reaction surface. When the specimen or viral antigen is added, it binds to the capture antibody. Bound antigen is detected by a second antiviral antibody, the \u2018detector\u2019 antibody. This detector antibody carries an enzyme label and, once bound, this enzyme produces a colour change. This colour change can be detected by photometry. The disadvantages of ELISA are that it is usually less sensitive and the reagents are only available for a limited number of viruses. In addition, adults tend to have lower viral titres in nasopharyngeal aspirates, making the sensitivity of this test understandably lower.",

They are now even more important when it comes to determining the immune status of an individual or to evaluating the immune response to vaccination. Serum is the specimen of choice for serological diagnosis and paired serum specimens 4 weeks apart are required for the diagnosis of current or recent viral infections. Demonstration of a seroconversion from a negative to a positive IgG antibody response or detection of the presence of virus-specific IgM can be diagnostic of primary viral infection. A fourfold increase in IgG titres between acute and convalescent sera (usually 4 weeks apart) may indicate a recent infection due to reinfection or reactivation; yet, such testing is retrospective and has little impact on a patient's immediate care. In addition, the result of serological tests for viral-specific antibodies must be interpreted with care for a number of reasons. First, there may be a delay or lack of production of serum antibodies, especially in the immunocompromised. Second, in recurrent infections, a significant rise in antibodies may not be apparent. Third, antibody levels can remain elevated for a long period of time following infection. Therefore, the clinical status of the patient has to be taken into account.",

However, for RNA viruses, the genome is too unstable to be used in PCR, and RNA has to be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, a retroviral enzyme that makes a precise copy of the mRNA. PCR is then performed in the normal manner to amplify genomic material.

Recent vaccines contain antigens of two influenza A subtypes, strains of the currently circulating H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes and one influenza B virus. The waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time requires annual re-immunisation, even if the vaccine antigens are unchanged. The current recommendation for influenza vaccination in the UK is to offer it to those over the age of 65, those with chronic heart, respiratory or renal disease and those who are diabetic or immunosuppressed. The national policy also states that those living in long-stay residential and nursing homes should be prioritised for vaccination. Despite the wide availability of the vaccine against influenza A, it still causes 13,000\u201320,000 excess deaths per year in the UK [78].",

Nasal decongestants improve cold symptoms in adults and improve nasal patency in children; however, their side effects, such as rebound obstruction and nasal epithelial drying, have impeded their use [90]. First-generation antihistamines have shown favourable effects upon nasal symptoms in adult studies, probably because of their anticholinergic effects [91]. Topical application of ipratropium (an anticholinergic drug) at a moderate dose, which is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhoea and sneezing in colds [92]. The routine use of cough medications in healthy children and adults should pose no potential problem, but they should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce symptoms in rhinovirus infections [93] by reducing fever, headache, sore throat and cough. This may be because prostaglandins are amongst the inflammatory mediators responsible in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds. Intranasal interferon alone is not a practical treatment option for the common cold; however, when it is used in combination with ipratropium and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it can significantly reduce symptoms in experimental colds [94].",
