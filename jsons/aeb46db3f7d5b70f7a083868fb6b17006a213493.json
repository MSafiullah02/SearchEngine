Little information is available on Phlebovirus entry. Low pH has been shown to affect the biochemical properties of the UUKV glycoproteins and induces fusion of cells expressing the glycoproteins of RVFV (Filone et al., 2006; Overby et al., 2008) . This suggests that host cell entry of phleboviruses is dependent on low pH. To analyze the entry of UUKV into mammalian tissue culture cells, we developed sensitive, quantitative tools and assays that allowed us to determine general properties of the UUKV entry process including binding, internalization, membrane trafficking, and acid-activated penetration.",

In the radioactive virus, the 35 S label was present in N, G N , and G C , whereas G N and G C were the only fluorescently labeled proteins in the UUKV-RED preparation ( Figures S2A and S2B ). That the nucleoprotein N was not fluorescent indicated that the viral envelope was intact. The different labeled particles could be visualized as single spots by confocal fluorescence microscopy and as 132 nm particles by EM after negative staining ( Figures S2C-S2E ). We noticed no significant impact of labeling on UUKV infectivity; the titers were similar to those of nonlabeled particles ( Figure S2F ).",

Additional processing steps in the endosomal compartments were apparently not required to activate fusion or infection by this virus. The bypass involved fusion of the viral membrane, and the plasma membrane was shown by the diffusion of the fluorescently labeled glycoproteins G N and G C into the plasma membrane of BHK-21 cells after acidification ( Figure 5D ). In contrast, under neutral pH conditions the fluorescent glycoproteins remained focal spots at the cell surface. The high density of viruses bound to the plasma membrane observed was due to use of a relatively high moi ($2).",

To assess its role in UUKV infection, we infected cells expressing dominant-negative or constitutively active mutants (EGFP-Rab7a T22N or EGFP-Rab7a Q67L, respectively). In A549 and BSC40 cells, expression of EGFP-Rab7a T22N did not block UUKV infection but also did not block infection by influenza A virus ( Figures 7C and 7D) . In contrast to influenza A virus, EGFP-Rab7a Q67L, however, promoted UUKV infection, by up to 40%, in all lines ( Figure 7C ). In some cell types, the maturation of LE also depends on microtubule-mediated transport of endosomes to the perinuclear region of the cell (reviewed in Mercer et al., 2010) and on proteasome activity (Khor et al., 2003) . For UUKV and influenza A virus, colcemid treatment resulted in a 30%-40% decrease in infection (Figures 7E and 7F ). MG132, a proteasome inhibitor known to divert influenza A virus away from late endosomes (Khor et al., 2003) , reduced UUKV infection in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines ( Figure 7G ). Altogether, these data show that UUKV resembles influenza A virus in that its entry depends on a normal maturation of LE. It is transported from EE to LE, and its pH of fusion corresponds to that prevailing in LE. It cannot infect cells in which cargo transport into the degradative branch of endocytic pathway is blocked.",

By EM, we could observe some of the UUKV particles in CCP and CCV, but these were rare. The majority were located in noncoated indentations at the plasma membrane and after endocytosis in noncoated, small cytoplasmic vesicles. The vesicles could represent CCV that had lost their clathrin coat or primary vesicles in a clathrinindependent pathway. The marginal effect of CHC knockdown compared to SFV could reflect the diversity of endocytic pathways used by UUKV or also differences in the role of clathrin in other processes, such as receptor recycling. Together, the results suggested that the majority of UUKV particles use a clathrin-independent pathway for infectious entry. After endocytic uptake, viruses were observed in larger vesicles, with the morphology of EE, LE, and MVE indicating that after internalization the viruses were channeled into the classical endosome pathway.",

By forcing the glycoproteins of other bunyaviruses to the cell surface through overexpression, others have measured cell-cell fusion ''from within'' and found that formation of syncitia occurred at slightly higher pH values, namely 5.8-6.4 with a threshold of about 6.0 (Filone et al., 2006; Plassmeyer et al., 2007) . Exactly what happens to glycoproteins G N and G C upon acidification is unclear. It has been reported that their biochemical properties undergo a change (Overby et al., 2008; Ronka et al., 1995) .

Expression of Rab5a S34N, which inhibits maturation of EE and homotypic EE fusion, affected all three viruses. In contrast, Rab5a Q79L and wortmannin, which cause expansion of EE and prevent proper LE maturation, only affected the late-penetrating viruses influenza A virus and UUKV. Similar observations have been recently reported for parvoviruses and for human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2), which are late penetrating (Brabec et al., 2006; Harbison et al., 2009) . That Rab5a Q79L had no adverse effect on SFV infection suggested that the pH in the giant EE was low enough to mediate fusion of this early-penetrating virus. One can conclude that UUKV passes through Rab5a-positive EE, but to be infectious it must reach more acidic downstream organelles, most probably late endosomal compartments.",

It is a key regulator in LE maturation, endosome movement, and fusion with lysosomes. Expression of the constitutively active Rab7a construct increased UUKV infectivity significantly. However, given the many indications that UUKV entered LE and used them for penetration, it was surprising that the inactive mutant Rab7 T22N did not have a more dramatic effect on infection. However, expression of Rab7 T22N has also not been found to affect infection by other late-penetrating viruses such as LCMV (Quirin et al., 2008) . There could be many explanations for this, such as the presence of multiple isoforms of Rab7, the lack of dominant-negative effect of the mutant, mislocalization of the mutant Rabs, etc. (Bucci et al., 2000) . It is apparent that results using Rab7 perturbants need to be interpreted with caution, and that the perturbations of the endosomal pathway need to be carefully evaluated in various virus systems and cell lines.",

            "text": "Our results indicated that UUKV is a late-penetrating virus and as such a member of a group of viruses that seem to use LE and possibly endolysosomes for penetration or transit. They include influenza A virus, dengue virus serotype 2 strain 1, HRV2, LCMV, canine and feline parvoviruses, murine and simian 40 polyomaviruses, and human papillomavirus 16 (Brabec et al., 2006; Harbison et al., 2009; Mercer et al., 2010; Qian et al., 2009; Quirin et al., 2008; Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003; van der Schaar et al., 2008) . Although they use diverse cell surface receptors, signaling pathways, and primary endocytic mechanisms, most of them seem to pass through EE, from which they are sorted into the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway. Penetration is not activated in EE. Instead they move together with endocytosed cargo and intralumenal vesicles into maturing endosomes, LE, endolysosomes, and lysosomes deeper into the cell. Typically, penetration occurs in the maturing endosomes or LE, but even later compartments cannot be excluded for some of them. The main distinction between these viruses and early-penetrating viruses such as SFV and VSV is that they have a lower pH threshold (5.4-5.8) of activation and therefore a longer half-time of penetration (>10-15 min) (Mercer et al., 2010) . Viruses of the polyoma family are exceptions because they continue from late endosomal organelles to the endoplasmic reticulum where penetration occurs (Qian et al., 2009 ). Unlike early-penetrating viruses, late viruses are sensitive to treatments that inhibit the proper maturation of LE and cargo transport into the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway. With the results presented here, UUKV can be confidently classified as a member of this interesting group of viruses, the detailed cell biology of which remains a challenge for future work.",
