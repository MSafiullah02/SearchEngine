Physical segregation was artificial, and dedicating nursing teams to separate cohorts of patients was impossible. A transient attempt to improve interbed spacing by reducing the number of beds per cubicle was abruptly reversed by pressure from bed management and the high hospital occupancy rates. The cancellation of surgical electives to facilitate patient segregation movements affected costs and inconvenienced patients. To facilitate appropriate patient placement, long delays in admissions from the emergency department ensued. Similar bed \u201ccrunches\u201d limited ring-fencing of vulnerable patients to parent wards and forced discontinuation of the \u201cunknown\u201d category 2 weeks into the outbreak.

            "text": "Some lessons were learned. Centralized planning, coordination, and dissemination of information from a multidisciplinary task force with a strong mandate from senior management were important. The experience dealing with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 allowed us to respond quickly to this new threat. Coordinated outbreak control measures were introduced within hours of the first VRE Task Force meeting. Typing using PFGE provided insight into the outbreak and nonoutbreak strains but was limited in its turnaround time. Identifying the outbreak clone by a faster method could have prompted earlier focused strategies. The existence of a VRE clone specific to ESRF patients suggests the need for a coordinated national effort to study VRE prevalence in community dialysis centers. Given our high background MRSA endemicity, determining MRSA status before the creation of VRE cohorts was imperative, as evidenced by the fact that more than 1/3 of cases were co-colonized or co-infected with MRSA Although this and the indefinite tagging of VRE-positive status stretched our limited isolation facilities, it certainly highlighted the need to also control endemic MRSA. Educating staff unfamiliar with VRE was challenging, but at least half of the staff attended more than 20 lectures held throughout the outbreak. Although an audit showed a noncompliance rate of 23.4% of 260 vancomycin orders, it offered opportunities to further educate prescribers. The scale of the outbreak necessitated dissemination of information to the public through the media and other resources. Although this prompted several claims for compensation from affected patients, it made it easier for the public to understand the constrained processes within the hospital during the outbreak.",

The total cost of this strategy is still being computed. Eradicating VRE was hampered by our large hospital size, heterogenous patient mix with numerous inpatient movements, and communal wards. The 2006 VRE incidence in SGH was 0.04 per 1000 patient-days. Along with surveillance of risk groups including communal ward patients, the following measures are aimed at averting another outbreak:\u2022Screening for VRE for all interhospital and overseas hospital transfers\u2022Screening for VRE in all patients sharing the same cubicle as a newly diagnosed carrier\u2022Isolation with contact precautions for all carriers\u2022Vancomycin audit, as well as audits of other antibiotics\u2022Hand hygiene vigilance\n",
