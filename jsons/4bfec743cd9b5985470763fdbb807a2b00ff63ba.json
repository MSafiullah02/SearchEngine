Engagement of programmed death-1 (PD-1), expressed on activated T cells, by its ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2) suppresses T-cell responses. Enhanced CNS PD-1 and PD-L1 expression has been documented in inflammatory murine models; however, human CNS data are still incomplete. We determined that human primary cultures of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, or neurons expressed low or undetectable PD-L1 under basal conditions, but inflammatory cytokines significantly induced such expression, especially on astrocytes and microglia. Blocking PD-L1 expression in astrocytes using specific siRNA led to significantly increased CD8 T-cell responses (proliferation, cytokines, lytic enzyme). Thus, our results establish that inflamed human glial cells can express sufficient and functional PD-L1 to inhibit CD8 T cell responses. Extensive immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem brain tissues demonstrated a significantly greater PD-L1 expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions compared with control tissues, which colocalized with astrocyte or microglia/macrophage cell markers. However, more than half of infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions did not express PD-1, the cognate receptor. Thus, our results demonstrate that inflamed human CNS cells such as in MS lesions express significantly elevated PD-L1, providing a means to reduce CD8 T cell responses, but most of these infiltrating immune cells are devoid of PD-1 and thus insensitive to PD-L1/L2. Strategies aimed at inducing PD-1 on deleterious activated human CD8 T cells that are devoid of this receptor could provide therapeutic benefits since PD-L1 is already increased in the target organ.

Although CD4 T lymphocytes have been established as important players in MS pathogenesis, CD8 T lymphocytes are increasingly recognized as potential contributors to tissue damage (Friese and Fugger, 2009; Mars et al., 2010) . CD8 T lymphocytes are detected in MS lesions, preferentially in the parenchyma and in greater amount than their CD4 counterparts (Lassmann, 2004; Neumann et al., 2002) . Detection of oligoclonal expansion of CD8 T lymphocytes in the CNS of MS patients (Babbe et al., 2000; Jacobsen et al., 2002; Junker et al., 2007; Skulina et al., 2004) suggests their local activation. CD8 T lymphocytes with polarized cytolytic granules are observed in close apposition to oligodendrocytes and demyelinated axons (Neumann et al., 2002) . Finally, up-regulated expression of major histocompatibility complex Class I (MHC-I) on microglia/ macrophages, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons in MS lesions supports the concept that CNS cells could be recognized and targeted by CD8 T cells (Hoftberger et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 224, "text": "(Sospedra and Martin, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 406, "end": 431, "text": "(Friese and Fugger, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 432, "end": 450, "text": "Mars et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 582, "end": 598, "text": "(Lassmann, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 599, "end": 620, "text": "Neumann et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 705, "end": 725, "text": "(Babbe et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 726, "end": 748, "text": "Jacobsen et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 749, "end": 769, "text": "Junker et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 770, "end": 791, "text": "Skulina et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 953, "end": 975, "text": "(Neumann et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1255, "text": "(Hoftberger et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "T cell responses are triggered by the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of MHC-peptide complexes and modulated by an array of co-activating or co-inhibiting molecules. The B7-CD28 family members play key roles in T-cell responses by contributing both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals. Programmed death-1 (PD-1), also called CD279, belongs to this family and is a crucial co-inhibitory receptor expressed by activated immune cells (Keir et al., 2008) . Whilst only small numbers of na\u20ac \u0131ve or resting human T lymphocytes express detectable PD-1, a proportion of these cells up-regulate this receptor upon activation (Kinter et al., 2008) ; however, the mechanisms dictating PD-1 acquisition by a fraction of activated T lymphocytes are still poorly understood. PD-1 participates in immune dysfunction and anergy of human CD8 T lymphocytes during chronic viral infections (Day et al., 2006; Trautmann et al., 2006; Urbani et al., 2006) . The interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 inhibits the TCR-mediated antigen receptor signaling including T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity (Carter et al., 2002; Freeman et al., 2000; Rodig et al., 2003) . Moreover, this interaction provides essential inhibitory signals to the fine balance between appropriate versus detrimental T-cell activation as illustrated by the various autoimmune diseases spontaneously developed by PD-1-deficient mice (Nishimura et al. 1999 (Nishimura et al. , 2001 . PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1 or CD274) is widely expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and non-immune cells.

In contrast, we detected PD-11 cells that were not positive for CD8 in MS lesions illustrating the capacity of other PD-11 cells, some being CD4 T lymphocytes (see Fig. 8 ) to infiltrate the CNS of MS patients. Activated CD4 and CD8 T cells have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier under both pathological and normal conditions (Vrethem et al., 1998) albeit in much lower number in normal controls. Thus, the few and scattered CD8 T cells we detected in normal controls were most likely activated T cells expressing PD-1. PD-1 levels on CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were lower from relapsing compared to remitting MS patients in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients (Trabattoni et al., 2009) . These results suggest that during active MS, when an important number of T lymphocytes infiltrates the CNS due to an impaired blood-brain barrier (Sospedra and Martin, 2005) , a smaller proportion of these cells expresses PD-1. We can also speculate that CNS infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes devoid of PD-1 have a functional advantage over their PD-11 counterparts and can locally proliferate since their TCR signalling is not inhibited by local PD-L1. Alternatively, PD-11 T cells could have undergone apoptosis in the MS tissues and thus be less abundant than their PD-1 negative counterparts.

Raptopoulou et al. observed that T lymphocytes that have infiltrated the target organ (synovial tissue and fluid) of rheumatoid arthritis patients were enriched in PD-11 cells compared with healthy tissues (Raptopoulou et al., 2010) . Thus, PD-11 T lymphocytes could be detected in human CNS and other organs targeted by autoimmune diseases supporting the notion that our results demonstrating the absence of PD-1 on most infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions is novel and unique.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 385, "text": "(Sadagopal et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 569, "end": 593, "text": "(Blackburn et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 820, "end": 840, "text": "(Phares et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1076, "text": "(Raptopoulou et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, our novel observations revealed the presence of PD-L1 on CNS cells in an inflamed environment in vitro and in MS lesions. We also demonstrate that this molecule has the capacity to modulate CD8 T-cell responses by dampening proliferation and cytokine production. The local expression of PD-L1 by tissue cells has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting T-cell responses in different mouse models. Whilst PD-L1 expression by islet cells protects from detrimental autoimmune CD4 T cell attack in a diabetes model (Keir et al., 2006) , PD-L1 expression by nonhematogenous cells diminished viral clearance and organ immunopathology mediated by CD8 T lymphocytes in a chronic infection model (Mueller et al., 2010) . Thus, human CNS cells can achieve the same capacity of abrogating T-cell responses. Finally, the lack of PD-1 on numerous infiltrating CD8 T cells suggests that these cells will not receive an inhibitory signal from the PD-L1 expressing CNS cells, astrocytes, or microglia/macrophages. Strategies aimed at boosting PD-1 levels on activated autoreactive human T cells could be a new promising therapeutic approach since PD-L1 is already increased in the target organ.", "cite_spans":
