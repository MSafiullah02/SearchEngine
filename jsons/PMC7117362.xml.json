By contrast, another canine virus, minute virus of canines (MVC) (Binn et al., 1970) has been considered to be a \u201cnon-pathogenic orphan virus\u201d (Carmichael, 1999). MVC, also known as canine parvovirus type 1 (Carmichael, 1987) or canine bocavirus (Manteufel and Truyen, 2008), and CPV-2 are unrelated parvovirus species belonging to different genera of the Parvoviridae (Macartney et al., 1988, Mochizuki et al., 2002, Schwartz et al., 2002). However, subsequent experimental studies revealed that MVC is a perinatal pathogen of dogs (Carmichael, 1987, Macartney et al., 1988). Clinical discrimination of the etiology of contagious pneumoenteric diseases of dogs is generally difficult, and at present, diagnosis for MVC infection is available only from particular research laboratories.",

Thus, MVC is distributed worldwide among domestic dogs of all ages (Carmichael et al., 1994, Hashimoto et al., 2001, Jang et al., 2003, J\u00e4rplid et al., 1996, Mochizuki et al., 2002, Pratelli et al., 1999, Truyen et al., 1996). The virus is pathogenic for the fetus and infection of pregnant bitches results in abortion (Carmichael et al., 1991, Truyen et al., 1996). MVC infection of young pups, typically less than 1-month old, may be either asymptomatic or cause a milder illness than that caused by CPV-2 (Carmichael et al., 1994, Macartney et al., 1988), although more serious disease may occur under certain field conditions (Harrison et al., 1992, J\u00e4rplid et al., 1996, Pratelli et al., 1999). By contrast, the pathogenic potential of MVC for adult dogs has been considered to be minimal (Binn et al., 1970, Carmichael et al., 1991, Carmichael et al., 1994, Hashimoto et al., 2001, Mochizuki et al., 2002). Genetic analysis has shown that the genomic structure of MVC is similar to those of bovine parvoviruses (BPV) and human bocaviruses (HBoV), and the genome size of an American GA3 strain is 5402 nucleotides in length (Schwartz et al., 2002, Sun et al., 2009).",

On the third day of hospitalization, the dog had bloody diarrhea in addition to vomiting. CPV-2 was considered as a possible cause but since a fecal specimen was found to be negative by a commercial test kit for CPV-2, it was submitted to our diagnostic laboratory for further virological examination. The dog received symptomatic therapy and subsequently recovered. The older Chihuahua also had similar signs just before the present case; however, the cause could not be established because no specimen was available for examination. The younger Chihuahua did not show any clinical signs throughout the period. Serum samples were taken from all three dogs in December, 2008, about 1 month after the incident.",

In this context, MVC was strongly suspected of being associated with the clinical signs of gastroenteritis. In the household, the two older dogs recovered from the illness and in the youngest dog the infection may have taken a subclinical course. This outcome is, however, contrary to the current concept of canine MVC infection (Carmichael, 1987, Carmichael, 1999) and suggested that the present MVC isolate 08-017 might be a novel strain which is pathogenic for adult dogs. Subsequently this was not confirmed by the experimental infection of the adolescent SPF dogs. In simple terms, the present animal experiment results may reflect the most probable relationship that occurs between MVC and aged dogs in the field: MVC infection of aged dogs results in antibody production but is accompanied only rarely by virus shedding so that MVC has not been found in most field cases. If this is true, the present field case with disease signs and virus shedding is a peculiar clinical experience.",

In the present study, the genomes of five MVC strains were compared. All MVCs have diverged from the common ancestor of bocaviruses and have evolved uniquely in the dog population worldwide (Fig. 1). A Korean MVC is genetically distant from American and Japanese MVCs especially when the NP1 genes were compared. MVCs may have evolved further within each geographical region (Fig. 2), but the analysis of more MVC isolates would be necessary to confirm such a conclusion.",

However the MVC isolate was not pathogenic in aged dogs infected experimentally. It will be necessary to accumulate further field cases to elucidate the clinical significance of MVC as a canine pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of MVC strains including the present MVC isolate suggested a possibility of geographically dependent evolution pattern of MVC.",
