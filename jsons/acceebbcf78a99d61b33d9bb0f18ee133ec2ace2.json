            "text": "Antigenic subtypes. The first of these three workshops focused on a discussion of the antigenic subtypes of hepatitis B. Hepatitis B antigen (HAA, HB Ag,l or Australia antigen) was first detected in the serum of an Australian aborigine; later it was recognized that this antigen is associated with hepatitis B. It is now known that sera from patients with hepatitis B may manifest several immunologic specificities as demonstrated by the double-diffusion precipitin reacdon. At this meeting the participants agreed that an antigenic determinant known as a was common to all hepatitis B antigens thus far studied and may be regarded as the group-specific antigen. Either the d or the y determinant, but not both, is usually associated with the groupspecific antigen a. The D subtype, possessing both a and d determinants, accounts for 40%-50% of cases, while Y subtype, possessing both a and y determinants, also accounts for 40 %-50% of cases. In less than 1% of blood samples tested, only the a antigen is detected. This might be because the subtype antigens are too weak for detection, are blocked, are destroyed, or are not made; or it might be because a new, unidentified subtype is present. Further research is needed to resolve the existence and character of other antigenic determinants. Some of the evidence pre- 1 The abbreviation HB Ag for hepatitis B antigen has been accepted by the Committee on Viral Hepatitis of the Division of Medical Sciences, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. However, pending editorial decision, The Journal retains the old abbreviation, HAA. 112 sented suggests that the y determinant is more likely to occur in acute, self-limited hepatitis than is the d determinant. As a corollary, d is more likely to be found in chronic hepatitis and in the chronic asymptomatic carrier. This association between chronicity and the d subtypes suggests that persistent antigenemia relates at least in part to the infecting agent rather than being solely determined by response of the host.",

Past attempts to propagate hepatitis agents in tissue culture have been either unsuccessful or unsubstantiated. Recently, Carver and Seto [1] have exposed human WI-38 cells to human serum containing HAA; these cells are then rendered refractory to infection by Newcastle disease virus according to hemadsorption tests. This technique may represent one of the more promising approaches to growing the agent of hepatitis B in tissue culture. The use of nonhuman primates as animal models for hepatitis was discussed and analyzed as to its practicality. Participants in this workshop reported some success in infecting the chimpanzee and the rhesus monkey with hepatitis B. It was reported that general susceptibility of primates to hepatitis B, as recognized by development of antibody to the hepatitis B antigen, appears to parallel the phylogenetic scale, with those primates closest to man being the most susceptible. Studies on infection of primates with hepatitis A indicate that the marmoset can serve as a potential animal model for this type of hepatitis.",

The establishment of breeding colonies for such primates as Saguinus mystax and Macaca mulatta would be a great help in protecting the natural reservoir of these animals and in providing a source of good animals for research. As a consequence of the limited usefulness of certain nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, gibbons, etc.) in research on hepatitis, emphasis should be placed on development of tissue-culture techniques for growth of hepatitis agents and on development of potential materials for vaccines.",

Immunohistochemical study of liver biopsies, using fluorescein-conjugated human antiserum to HAA or by indirect immunofluorescence with guineapig antiserum to HAA, demonstrates various patterns of distribution of this virus-associated antigen. The antigen is usually observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in a focal distribution within the liver. It is less commonly found diffusely in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Granular deposition of the antigen in nonhepatocytes, including Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and infiltrating mononuclear cells, is also seen, particularly in latter stages or during persistent infection. Evidence that immunoglobulin and complement components are deposited together in the last group suggests intrahepatic localization of immune complexes of antibody to HAA.",

The Dane particle can be disrupted with Tween 80 treatment into these two components, but the inner component may be unstable. Antibody to HAA and antibody to the inner core of the Dane particle might be associated with hepatitis B, although the role of these two antibodies in immune-complex formation or in protective immunity to hepatitis B infection is yet to be determined. Cell-mediated immune responses may also be involved in the conferral of immunity to hepatitis B. Cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate and prostaglandins might also play a role in controlling the immune response to hepatitis B.",
