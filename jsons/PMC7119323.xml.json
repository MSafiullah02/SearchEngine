Given the underdeveloped health infrastructures in the 3 primary affected nations and the high transmission and mortality rate of the disease, domestic and international public health agencies called for aid and personnel to be rapidly deployed to the affected nations to treat infected patients and prevent further spread of the Ebola outbreak. Yet despite significant efforts from the international community, EVD continues to represent a significant challenge in the region. As of January 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the total case count stands at 21,689 with 8,626 deaths and continues to rise.1\n",

This fear was heightened after the initial missed diagnosis in a US emergency department of a patient with EVD who later died,2 the transmission of Ebola to 2 nurses who cared for this patient3 and a subsequent case of an emergency physician who traveled to West Africa to care for patients with EVD and required hospitalization after returning to the United States.4 These cases raised significant concerns that US emergency departments and hospitals were not adequately prepared to diagnose and treat patients with EVD. In addition, the infection of healthcare personnel created the specter of a more widespread outbreak in the general population due to poor infection control guidelines, inadequate training and management protocols in US medical centers and initially absent mechanisms to identify potentially infected individuals arriving through US ports of entry.5 A subsequent controversy surrounding a nurse who returned from West Africa without symptoms of EVD and was held in quarantine highlighted concerns about how personal liberty and public health should be appropriately balanced.6 In response, both emergency medicine and emergency nursing organizations and federal agencies have issued guidance on the nature of EVD, approaches to identification, isolation and treatment of potential patients and standards for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare providers.7, 8, 9\n",

Issues articulated in the medical literature and by the press include the following: how resources should be used in preparation for the likely rare event of an undiagnosed patient with EVD who presents to a US emergency department,10 whether there should be a different standard for care of Ebola-infected patients than for other patients with less contagious and lethal diseases11 and whether healthcare providers are obligated to place themselves at a significant degree of risk while caring for these patients due to their professional status.12 To address these concerns, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the Emergency Nurses Association (ENA), and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) developed this joint position paper to provide guidance to US emergency physicians, emergency nurses and other stakeholders in the healthcare system on how to approach the ethical issues posed by the outbreak of EVD. This paper will address areas of immediate and potential ethical concern to US emergency departments in how they approach preparation for and management of potential patients with EVD.",

            "text": "Since the outbreak of EVD, numerous articles have been published on the epidemiologic characteristics of this condition and the microbiological details of the causative organism.13, 14, 15, 16 However, particular characteristics of EVD are worth highlighting to provide the factual basis for addressing the ethical questions raised in this outbreak for US emergency departments. First, it is well recognized that individuals with EVD will often have relatively non-specific symptoms, common to many viral infections, in their initial stages of presentation (eg, fever, headache, myalgias).15, 17 Such non-specific presentations make unrecognized infection with Ebola a realistic concern. Lack of prompt identification of potential patients by emergency department staff can increase the risk of spread of the disease and mandates a heightened awareness of the risk factors for the disease. Second, the pathophysiology of contagion is related to contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected individual, with rising viremia in the late stages of disease presenting a particular risk for human-to-human transmission. However, even a low level of viral inoculation can lead to EVD.18 This recognized pathway of spread aids in evaluating the risk of transmission from patient to healthcare providers or the general public. At the same time, knowledge of how the Ebola virus is transmitted heightens the ethical concerns posed by the potential presentation of highly symptomatic and contagious patient(s) to an emergency department, especially if to a center without specialized experience in the care of EVD patients. Finally, the lack of specific effective treatment and the high mortality rate posed by EVD exacerbates public fears, may create irrational panic relative to the actual risk and lead to unexpected institutional consequences such as the avoidance of the use of healthcare facilities where EVD patients are being or have been treated.",

It is estimated that 50% of admissions to hospitals in the US are initially assessed and treated in emergency departments.20 The emergency department is also the only access point in the US acute healthcare system available to patients 24 hours per day-7 days per week. In the US there is a legal obligation under EMTALA to provide a medical screening exam for an emergency medical condition and treatment until the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized to the extent of that hospital\u2019s capability (until appropriate transfer) regardless of insurance status or other socioeconomic factors.21, 22 Finally, the emergency department is the primary location for the initial evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of the acutely ill undifferentiated patient. These facts together help define the ethical construct of emergency medical practice where access to quality emergency care is a right of all patients in the US.

The ACEP Code of Ethics notes the requirement of the adequacy of in-hospital and outpatient resources in the provision of emergency care.23 The American Medical Association Code of Ethics states that \u201cBecause of their commitment to care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters. This ethical obligation holds even in the face of greater than usual risks to their own safety, health or life. The physician workforce, however, is not an unlimited resource; therefore, when participating in disaster responses, physicians should balance immediate benefits to individual patients with ability to care for patients in the future.\u201d26 The American Nurses Association Code of Ethics specifically states, \u201cThe nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety.\u201d27 Within the larger ethics literature, explorations of whether there is a duty to treat on the part of healthcare providers at risk to themselves also indicates that codes of ethics, historical references and theoretical analysis do not mandate an absolute obligation. Rather, particular factors of disease process, availability of resources and training, countervailing responsibilities outside of the professional realm, personal viewpoints on the virtues of courage and resilience as well as relational ethics perspectives and obligations imposed by professional status have guided the evaluations of the obligations of healthcare providers in the face of outbreaks of infectious disease.28, 29, 30, 31 For emergency departments, emergency physicians and emergency nurses, there is a need to weigh all of these considerations against the special role played by emergency departments in the US healthcare system and the duties that accompany the professional status of emergency physicians and emergency nurses.",

If the current outbreak were to spread significantly within the US, the ethical evaluation of the appropriateness of supporting volunteerism overseas would likely change since this could result in the expertise on the management of EVD being shifted out of the country rather than being available domestically.

As has been reported in the press, hospitals have expressed concern that the potential costs and risks accrued in treating an Ebola patient along with the public fear generated by the disease may have an adverse impact on volumes and financial results for medical centers. The facility in Dallas that treated a recent case reported that afterward emergency department volumes dropped and still have not returned to their expected level.19 It is therefore imperative, in the face of a disease such as Ebola that has generated such public scrutiny and at times hysteria, for hospitals to be cognizant of their ethical responsibility to support the efforts of designated treatment centers as well as frontline facilities that might encounter Ebola patients and potentially be perceived adversely by the public. We affirm that the principle of reciprocity extends beyond physical means of support (equipment, personnel) to reputational support in the setting of an outbreak of EVD. Such support could, where appropriate, take the form of publicly confirming the safety and quality of other healthcare facilities with Ebola patients, educating other facilities on effective policies and procedures in caring for EVD patients and avoiding messages that implicitly suggest a competitive advantage from not treating patients with this highly infectious disease. Through such support, hospitals ensure that the public is aware and reassured of the unified response the medical system will take towards both the existing epidemic and the potential for worsening if the outbreak spreads from West Africa. Without such reputational support and cohesion in the healthcare system, should the epidemic worsen, it is conceivable that public doubt and panic may lead to untenable consequences such as facilities avoiding the care of at-risk patients and the public fearing certain hospitals as being sites of contagion rather than medical care.",

This social contract calls for a rational person to expect an emergency physician or nurse to apply their skills to aid an acutely ill patient but at the same time for those professionals to have the requisite training and equipment to provide such aid in an appropriate manner.68\n",

In the case of Ebola, where the evidence to date is that an overwhelming amount of critical care resources are required to effectively treat a late-stage patient, disaster triage protocols would need to weigh at what point in the treatment spectrum such resource expenditure would become untenable. Such protocols, to be ethically appropriate, would need to be transparent, proportionate and accountable to oversight along with having a legal imprimatur to be effective in the emergency department and acute care setting.69 To avoid such a crisis situation, the devotion of resources now to end the epidemic in the primary outbreak zone in Africa is vital.",

In some ways, Ebola is a unique test for US emergency departments, emergency physicians, emergency nurses and other stakeholders given its rarity in the US, high mortality rate, high risk of transmission to healthcare staff and non-specific presenting symptoms that can make initial diagnosis more difficult. However, as shown with other unanticipated infectious disease outbreaks (HIV, SARS, MERS), emergency departments will almost certainly be a key location for patient identification and treatment. The ethical concepts applied in this paper are relevant, especially reciprocity, duty to treat and grounding in the specific facts of the disease process in question, when considering how acute care facilities should prepare for likely future outbreaks of infectious disease. We propose that preparation for future emergency department responses to unanticipated infectious disease outbreaks should include ethical as well as logistical and medical factors.69 Given the multiple stakeholders represented in emergency department practice, the model shown here of multi-disciplinary and organizational consideration of the ethical issues involved would likely have application when considering the approach to future infectious disease challenges.",
