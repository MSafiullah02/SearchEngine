He reported that 2 to 3 weeks before his hospital presentation he had had subjective fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough, which he had treated with multiple doses of ibuprofen. These complaints resolved 1 week before this hospital presentation, but he subsequently developed worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia that persisted for the following week, leading to his hospital presentation. He described lightheadedness when rising from a recumbent position. He reported decreased urine output but denied gross hematuria, frothy urine, or flank pain. He denied any new lower extremity edema or orthopnea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in mentation, persistent respiratory infectious symptoms, recent travel, or sick contacts. Other than his recent use of ibuprofen, he denied any other medication, vitamin supplementation, or herbal remedy. His medical history included obesity and obstructive sleep apnea for which he used nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, 93 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ) on routine laboratory testing 16 months prior. He had no family history of kidney disease. He was born in Nigeria, worked as a nurse, lived with his wife and children in New York City, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs.",

Nevertheless, given the biopsy findings and his recent resolved respiratory illness, on hospital day 10, he was screened for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by nasal swab and was found to be positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Because he lacked respiratory symptoms, the infectious disease service deemed him not to be a candidate for clinical trial of remdesivir. A request for tocilizumab was initially declined because it was in short supply and reserved for life-threatening respiratory failure. As shown in Table 1 , despite an interim negative screen, he continued to screen positive for SARS-CoV-2 on hospital day 17. Although his lactate dehydrogenase down-trended and albumin up-trended toward the end of his hospitalization, he remained dialysis dependent. On hospital day 23, tocilizumab became available and he was dosed 400 mg. He was also started on prednisone 80 mg daily with a plan for 1 month of therapy with further taper to be determined based on change in residual renal function.

CG not associated with HIV/AIDS was first described in the mid-1980s in a small case series of African American patients with nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive irreversible kidney failure. 1 211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264   265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318 typified by hyperplastic and hypertrophic visceral epithelial cells overlying segmentally or globally collapsed glomerular capillaries that are narrowed or obliterated by wrinkling and retraction of glomerular basement membranes. At the ultrastructural level, podocytes show severe foot process effacement with focal podocyte detachment and parietal cell coverage. Cases associated with viral infection, such as HIV, may have endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions (interferon Q3 footprints). The tubulointerstitial compartment often contains an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, including monocytes, CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells, and variable plasma cells. Tubular epithelial cells typically display degenerative and regenerative changes and aberrant cellular proliferation and differentiation, leading to microcystic transformation. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are common; however, comparative studies have shown that these indices were numerically but not significantly more frequent in CG compared with noncollapsing FSGS. 2 A dysregulated podocyte phenotype has been identified in both HIV and non-HIV-associated CG. As podocytes are injured and depleted, the visceral epithelial cells show downregulation and loss of mature podocyte markers with de novo expression of markers associated with proliferation and activated parietal epithelial cells. 3, 4 CG not associated with HIV/AIDS may be idiopathic or associated with a variety of conditions, including other viral infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19) and nonviral infections (such as tuberculosis), autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), drug exposures (such as pamidronate and interferon), hemophagocytic syndrome, and acute glomerular ischemia, among others. 5 Many of these exposures are thought to mediate CG by podocyte cytotoxicity, such as via proinflammatory cytokine expression including type 1 interferons. 6 It is also well recognized that a large proportion of patients with CG carry 2 allelic risk variants of APOL1, namely G1 and G2, which are common in individuals of West African ancestry and also confer risk for hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease. 7 Indeed, the APOL1 high-risk genotype (either G1/G1, G1/G2, or G2/G2), which is found in approximately 10% to 15% of the African American population, is disproportionately represented in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy and non-HIVassociated CG. In general, patients with 2 high-risk APOL1 alleles have a higher likelihood of eventually reaching end-stage kidney disease, although their response to immunosuppression is not modified by their APOL1 high-risk status. 8 Evidence from animal models and cell culture systems suggests that the highrisk APOL1 genotype may mediate podocyte damage via upregulation of APOL1 through activation of a viral program in the podocyte, leading to dysregulated endosomal trafficking and autophagic flux, resulting in podocyte depletion and glomerular scarring. 6 With the exception of HIV-associated nephropathy and parvovirus B19-associated CG, in which virus has been identified in renal epithelial cells, other virally mediated forms of CG in patients with high-risk APOL1 genotype typically lack evidence of direct viral infection of the renal parenchyma, supporting potential interferon-mediated podocyte effects. In our case, in situ hybridization did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the renal tissue.",

Valeri and colleagues 2 reported a mean time from biopsy to end-stage kidney disease to be 13 months in the 43 cases of idiopathic CG (average creatinine at baseline, 4.2 mg/dl) compared with 62.5 months in the 50 age-matched controls with FSGS not otherwise specified (average creatinine at baseline, 2.0 mg/dl). Moreover, none of the patients with CG in this series achieved remission with glucocorticoid therapy, although 3 of 43 had a spontaneous remission and 2 of 5 patients treated with cyclosporine achieved a remission. 2 Another series compared outcomes between 61 patients with CG (average creatinine at baseline, 1.5 mg/dl) and 126 patients with FSGS not otherwise specified (average creatinine at baseline, 1.2 mg/dl) and found that, overall, 48% of patients with CG versus 26% of patients with FSGS not otherwise specified reached end-stage kidney disease at 69 months. However, the authors reported that among patients with CG who were immunosuppressed (with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or both), 70% achieved remission. 9 web 4C=FPO Generally, patients with idiopathic CG without severe glomerulosclerosis or interstitial fibrosis are offered immunosuppression with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors based on evidence that immunosuppression may improve remission rates and that high-risk APOL1 genotype status does not modify response to immunosuppression. 8, 9 It is less clear, however, whether patients who develop CG related to a viral illness (such as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus, among others) should also receive immunosuppression. There are reports of treating patients with CG related to cytomegalovirus viremia simultaneously with antiviral therapy and glucocorticoids with good effect. S1,S2",

S3 Severe disease is typified by a cytokine release syndrome with increased levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and interferon-gamma, as well as increased proliferation of the Th17 cell population. S4 A recent prospective cohort study S5 reviewed kidney disease among 701 patients who were treated for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Those patients with kidney disease had higher inhospital mortality; moreover, there was evidence of hematuria in 26.7% and proteinuria in 43.9% of patients in their cohort. Although kidney tissue was not examined, the authors postulated potential multifactorial renal injury, including direct cytopathic effects (via viral entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors expressed on tubular epithelium), as well as tubular injury from cytokine storm, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. S5 A recent publication of kidney findings at autopsy among 26 patients from China who died of severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease revealed that the predominant findings were acute tubular injury, erythrocyte aggregation in peritubular capillaries, and direct viral infection of tubular epithelium and podocytes; none had CG, although 2 had FSGS, but the morphologic variant of FSGS was not specified. S6 The heightened cytokine release associated with COVID-19 infection places patients with the APOL1 high-risk genotype particularly at risk for interferon-mediated podocyte injury, as can occur in other virally mediated forms of CG, interferon therapyinduced CG, and lupus-associated CG. Patients with COVID-19 may have a biphasic disease course whereby after an initial onset of symptoms there is a time lapse (w8 days) of worsening respiratory symptoms that corresponds with an exuberant inflammatory response. S3 In our patient with APOL1 high-risk genotype, it is plausible that an exuberant inflammatory response induced CG without the usual predominant pulmonary manifestations.",

Larsen and colleagues S7 reported another patient with CG associated with COVID-19 with more significant pulmonary manifestations. CG has not been reported in outbreaks in China and Europe, probably because APOL1 high-risk genotypes are present only in populations of African ancestry. High-risk genotypes have been reported in 10% to 15% of African American individuals and can also be detected in persons of Hispanic/Afro-Caribbean ancestry. Considering the projected 50% to 80% attack rates of COVID-19 in the general population, S8,S9 a significant fraction of the population with West African ancestry may be at risk of developing kidney injury from CG as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps through the Americas and the African continent. As we learn more about the renal manifestations of COVID-19, we should keep in mind the possibility of CG among patients with COVID-19 with proteinuria and acute kidney injury, even among those with mild respiratory disease. Future research will be needed to determine optimal management, and particularly whether there is a role for antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies, including nonspecific agents like glucocorticoids or targeted therapies against specific cytokines or leukocyte subsets (Table 2) .",
