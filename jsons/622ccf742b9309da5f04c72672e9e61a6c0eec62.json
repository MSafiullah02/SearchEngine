            "text": "Background: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first spread quickly in Wuhan, China, then globally. From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a \"cytokine storm,\" is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients. Methods: We investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature. Results: Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks. Conclusions: This study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.",

On March 11, 2020, with many infected people reported in numerous countries, COVID-19 was declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 . Two previous separate outbreaks of coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV) emerged in specific regions of the world before the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 2,3 . SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to SARS-CoV with a 76% amino acid sequence identity and the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Concomitantly, TMPRSS2, the serine protease for virus Spike (S) protein priming, also was considered indispensable for cell entry by SARS-CoV-2. In other words, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are proven key molecules for cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 4 .",

However, in seriously affected individuals, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe pulmonary complication that is triggered by a cytokine storm and results in a high mortality rate 5 . However, in addition to the central symptoms that affect the respiratory system, the possibility of COVID-19 damaging the digestive and urogenital tracts has been reported, possibly a result of high viral loads and the biological functions of ACE2 6 . Moreover, the amplified proinflammatory cytokines could spill over into the circulation and induce a \"cytokine storm,\" leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill patients 7 . Recent studies have reported damage to the urinary tract in patients infected with COVID-19. A retrospective study by Huang et al. reported the outcomes of 41 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and stated that three patients developed complicated acute kidney injury (AKI), and all three needed ICU care 8 . Another retrospective, multi-center cohort study demonstrated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 191 COVID-19 patients, of whom 27 individuals were reported to have AKI, and ten were treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) 9 . A brief review of existing papers that reported urology system impairment associated with COVID-19 infection is shown in Table 1 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

It is tempting to speculate that such complications might be mediated by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the kidney via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Up to now, little direct evidence has been demonstrated for injury to the testis by SARS-CoV-2. However, one study analyzed autopsy specimens of testis from six patients who died from SARS and reported that the SARS virus could induce orchitis, but no positive ISH staining was detected in the testis 35 . Another study reported that SARS-CoV-2 transmission through seminal fluid was hard to achieve and that almost no virus RNA was found in testis cells by qRT-PCR 16 . However, it must be noted that a low detection rate of COVID-19 using PCR was a limitation in these studies.

            "text": "Given the possible role of cytokines (especially IL6) in COVID-19 illness, we established a signature that included ACE2 and various cytokine receptors. By performing cell-specific analysis with our signature in the kidney, we found that ACE2 was remarkable higher in proximal tubule cells, and IL6ST (the main receptor for IL6) was significantly enriched in fenestrated and glomerular endothelial cells. From the results of the histopathological examinations conducted by Su et al. on 26 autopsy kidney samples from COVID-19 patients, diffuse injury was observed in proximal tubules and included the loss of the brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even marked necrosis 36 . Besides, nine samples showed increased serum creatinine and (or) the appearance of proteinuria. Our results might partially explain this phenomenon. First, with higher ACE2 expression in proximal tubule cells, the mutual interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 may promote virus entry into the cells. Following cell entry, the virus would cause tissue damage via direct injury due to the viral cytotoxicity 37 . Kidney proximal tubule cells with ACE2-positive expression showed some relevant biological events for the mechanisms of injury, including virus regulation, autophagy regulation, and immune and kidney water homeostasis pathways by GSEA. Secondly, the elevated cytokines in infected patients could result in aberrant immune responses and local damage via binding with cytokine receptors in fenestrated and glomerular endothelial cells 38 . This damage would impair the function of the renal glomerular filtration barrier and could feasibly account for the observed abnormalities in serum creatinine and proteinuria.",

            "text": "In the testis, ACE2 is predominantly expressed in gametocytes, Sertoli cells, and spermatogonial stem cells. While this finding suggested that the testis was a high-risk organ that was vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct entry of the virus into testis would be difficult due to the presence of the blood-testis barrier. One study stated that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was detected in the semen of male 19 . Despite this, orchitis was reported as a complication of SARS 35 . More importantly, scrotal discomfort in COVID-19 patients has been reported, indicating potential testis injury 16 . From our results, the high expression of multiple cytokine receptors was discovered in testis macrophages, which may disturb their normal functional status, especially in the high cytokine environment of severe COVID-19 patients. The imbalance of macrophages and cytokines is instrumental in the inflammatory response, which could disrupt the functions of Leydig cells, damage the blood-testis barrier, and directly destroy the seminiferous epithelium 35, 39 . Meanwhile, the production of inflammatory factors may activate the autoimmune response and auto-antibody development within the tubules, further triggering a secondary autoimmune response 40 . Evidence from a rodent model of autoimmune orchitis demonstrated that increased IL6 and its receptor could result in testicular inflammation and germ cell apoptosis, and ultimately, was involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune orchitis 41 . Considering the high level of IL6 in severe COVID-19 patients and that IL6 receptor was enriched in various testicular cells, this might be a reason for the potential orchitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. As indicated by GSEA, ACE2-positive cells in the testis might tend to express the genes implicated in the biological process of the virus. Though the specific mechanism is not clear, this finding might provide insight into the testicular damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, we conducted an ACE2 sequence alignment in multiple species, which suggested that felidae and canids (cats, tigers, dogs, and raccoon dogs) shared high sequence similarity of ACE2 with humans. This might be a possible explanation for the fact that seven tigers in the Bronx zoo (New York, USA) were infected with COVID-19 by an asymptomatic zookeeper infected with COVID-19 (https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/us/tiger-coronavirus-new-york-trnd/index.html). Also, ACE2 is highly expressed in the kidneys among people with chronic kidney diseases, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as by airway epithelial cells among smokers and lung tissue among people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. These results suggest that the ACE2 expression increases in the corresponding organs of specific populations with underlying diseases, resulting in a higher risk of infection. Thus, particular attention should be given to related symptoms in specific populations.",
