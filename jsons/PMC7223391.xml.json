Around 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV and the annual mortality from HCV-related liver diseases reach up to 700,000 individual (Ministry of Health and 2015; World Health Organization 2016; Jefferies et al. 2018). In the past decade, interferon-based therapy was the gold standard for HCV treatment with a sustained virological response (SVR) rate hovering around 50%. The recent approval of oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), like HCV NS3 protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, for clinical use improved the SVR rates to more than 90% (Pawlotsky 2016; Falade-Nwulia et al. 2017). Nevertheless, cirrhosis patients remain at risk for severe complications. In addition, treatment with DAAs is not affordable for many patients and they are still not readily available around the globe. Therefore, uncovering novel HCV inhibitors is still a clinical priority.",

DENV is currently endemic in more than 100 countries with the highest prevalence in South-East Asia, Africa and the Americas (Mackenzie et al. 2004; Malavige et al. 2004; Deen et al. 2006; Bhatt et al. 2013). Each year, there are around 390 million DENV infections are recorded worldwide and among them 50 to 100 million patients are presented with the clinical manifestations of dengue fever (Bhatt et al. 2013). Dengue fever leads to 20,000 annual deaths, mainly in young children (Rui-feng et al. 2008). To date, four DENV serotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, have been identified and infections with one serotype does not offer protection from infection with the remaining three serotypes (Weaver and Vasilakis 2009; Messina et al. 2014; Mustafa et al. 2015). A major impediment to the development of vaccines is that vaccines should have a tetravalent effect, i.e. sufficient protective immune responses against all four DENV serotypes. Owing to the absence of specific treatments against DENV and the limitations of the available vaccine (Dengvaxia\u00ae or CYD-TDV), the global burden of DENV infection is becoming enormous (Behnam et al. 2016). Therefore, the development of new antiviral compounds against DENV infections is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Scorpion venom is a rich source for drug discovery and prototyping (Ortiz et al. 2015; Ghosh et al. 2019). Scorpion venoms are highly complex mixture of nucleotides, enzymes, mucoproteins, biogenic amines, nucleotides, salts, as well as peptides and proteins (Omran 2003; Rodriguez de la Vega and Possani 2005; Ozkan et al. 2006a, b, c; Feng et al. 2008; Kanoo and Deshpande 2008; Ortiz et al. 2015). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), isolated from several venomous animals, exhibit a wide range of antibacterial and antiviral activity with direct or indirect microbicide activity (Hv et al. 2006; Ortiz et al. 2015). Several studies demonstrated an antiviral effect for certain scorpion venom peptides (Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 2008; El-Bitar et al. 2015; Ortiz et al. 2015). In this study, we report the molecular and functional characterization of a new antiviral peptide (Smp76), a scorpion-like peptide derived from an Egyptian scorpion\u2019s venom, S. m. palmatus. Our findings will broaden the currently known antiviral peptides and open a new avenue for the development of novel HCV and DENV therapies.",

The sequence of scorpine carboxyl terminal region is similar to that of \u03b2-KTx family, with cysteine-stabilized \u03b1/\u03b2 fold, and three disulfide bridges. On the other hand, its amino-terminal region is identical to the cecropin family peptides (Conde et al. 2000). Scorpine has also amino acid sequences similar to AMPs and K+ channel blocking peptides (Luna-Ramirez et al. 2015). Scorpine homologs were thereafter identified from the venom of various scorpions such as Opistophthalmus carinatus (Zhu and Tytgat 2004), Heterometrus laoticus (Uawonggul et al. 2007), H. gertschi (Schwartz et al. 2007), S. m. palmatus (Abdel-Rahman et al. 2013), genus Vaejovis (Quintero-Hernandez et al. 2015) and Urodacus yaschenkoi (Luna-Ramirez et al. 2015). Importantly, all these peptides possess anti-malaria as well as antimicrobial activities (Conde et al. 2000; Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 2008) and act also as potassium channel blockers (Diego-Garcia et al. 2007). The present data clearly showed that smp76 inhibits the ability of HCV virus to infect the host cells. Indeed, our previous study demonstrated that the crude venom of S. m. palmatus venom prevents HCV infection with direct virocidal activity (El-Bitar et al. 2015). On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that, smp76 peptide might has an independent effect on the receptor complexes of host cell components or interacts with components that inactivate viral entry. This possibility will be further investigated by the incubation of smp76 with cells in a free-virus condition prior to HCV infection. However, it worth to mention that the incubation of S. m. palmatus crude venom with cells prior to the HCV infection of cells did not impair the viral infectivity (El-Bitar et al. 2015). Thus, the possible effect of smp76 on the host cell to abrogate HCV infection is unlikely. In the present study, Smp76 prevents the early stages of life cycle of HCV and DENV most probably through interacting with viral particles. The viral particle can be neutralized by targeting the envelope of the HCV or host factors related to the mature viral particle (Zeisel et al. 2013). Notably, it has been reported in various studies that the structure of biological membranes could be altered by AMPs (Zasloff 2002; Harrison et al. 2016).",

Currently dengue virus considered as one of the most important arthropod born viral disease worldwide (Botta et al. 2018). Despite the global efforts, there is no antiviral therapy against DENV infections clinically approved and only symptomatic treatment and hospital supportive care setting are available for infected people (Behnam et al. 2016). It was shown that recombinantly expressed scorpine (RScrp) inhibited DENV-2 replication in C6/36 mosquito cells. Also, it was suggested that the development of transgenic mosquitoes that overexpress and correctly secrete RScrp and could eventually break the dengue fever transmission (Carballar-Lejarazu et al. 2008). On the other hand, Smp76, as an infection inhibitor, has some advantages compared to antiviral drugs that target the viral replication stages inside the target cell. Smp76 can inhibit DENV infection before viral entry and is, therefore, helpful for treatment of DENV viraemia.",

However, Smp76 isolation from natural sources is ineffectual and time-consuming. Synthetic Smp76 without disulfide bonds showed no antiviral activities against HCV and DENV. One possibility is that the synthetic Smp76 peptide without disulfide bonds did not have the properly folded structure necessary for activity. Recently, recombinant scorpine with antimalarial and antibacterial activities was produced by different fusion technology using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) (Zhang et al. 2014) and maltose binding protein (MBP) (Zhang et al. 2016). These methods have improved efficiency and reduced the cost of producing scorpine and can contribute to the future production of active recombinant Smp76. Interestingly, the recombinant Smp76 was shown to inhibit DENV and ZIKV infections in cultured cell lines and primary mouse macrophages. However, rSmp76 did not inactivate the viral particles directly but suppressed the established viral infection by upregulating the expression of IFN-\u03b2 (Ji et al. 2018). This mechanism is significantly different from the virucidal effect of native Smp76 peptides. The exact mechanism by which Smp76 exerts its antiviral activity against HCV and DENV to inhibit infecting their target cells need further studies. In vivo studies should also assess the future role of Smp76 in managing HCV and DENV infections.",
