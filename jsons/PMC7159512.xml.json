To address the question of how the acute\u2010phase reaction in PIA is genetically regulated, serum was taken from 153 (E3 \u00d7 DA)F2 intercross rats on days 14, 35, 49, and 100 after pristane injection. The loci controlling arthritis in this intercross have previously been determined (30). Serum was analyzed for the acute\u2010phase proteins \u03b11\u2010acid glycoprotein, \u03b11\u2010inhibitor3, and IL\u20106; because serum instead of plasma was obtained for this experiment, fibrinogen could not be analyzed. The acute\u2010phase proteins were then used as quantitative traits in linkage analysis using the MapMaker software package (31). The QTLs identified are summarized in Table 2. In order to detect sex\u2010specific effects, the 83 male and 70 female rats were analyzed separately.",

Interestingly, PIA is MHC associated and the association is not primarily with susceptibility, but rather, with chronic severity (18), as has been suggested for the association of MHC in RA (3). However, there is no clear evidence in PIA for any immune response to cartilage proteins (Olofsson P, et al: unpublished observations). This is in contrast to RA, where antibodies specific for various cartilage proteins, such as type II collagen, are detectable in a substantial proportion of patients (36) and is correlated with HLA\u2010DR alleles (37).",

The function and mechanism of \u03b11\u2010acid glycoprotein regulation remain unclear.

The observation that the strongest linkage to the \u03b11\u2010acid glycoprotein levels was observed earlier (day 14) than the linkage to arthritis severity (day 35) suggests that it is involved in a primary mechanism in the pathogenic pathway.

In the mouse CIA model, IL\u20106 is expressed in the joints as one of the earliest markers of inflammation (45). It has been reported that IL\u20106\u2010deficient mice are either not susceptible to arthritis (46) or have a delayed onset, although with a similar incidence of CIA as in wild\u2010type control mice (11). Blockage of the IL\u20106 receptor with monoclonal antibodies was shown to reduce the severity of CIA in mice (47). Thus, it is clear that IL\u20106 is an important factor in the first acute phase of arthritis. This was also indicated in our PIA model by the elevated IL\u20106 levels in the susceptible rat strains. However, our findings also showed that there was a recurrence of IL\u20106 production associated with the relapsing phase of arthritis, which is of critical importance for comparison with RA. Interestingly, this recurrence is genetically determined, since only the DA strain, with a more pronounced relapsing arthritis, had elevated IL\u20106 levels, whereas the LEW.1F strain had elevated levels only during the acute phase.",
