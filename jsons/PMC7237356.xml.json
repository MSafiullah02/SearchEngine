            "text": "We suspect there are multiple potential causes for the increase in methanol poisoning. First, obtaining alcoholic drinks in Iran is far more difficult than in other countries in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is legal. This limited access to alcohol has been exacerbated by the emergence of COVID-19 in Iran where the disease has spread to more than 100,000 cases.2 Specifically, the large industrial use of ethanol for the manufacturing of hand sanitizers, which has been promoted for combating the spread of COVID-19, has created an unprecedented shortage in ethanol and has given way to individuals who were previously using ethanol for the manufacturing of alcohol beverages to shift to the use of methanol instead. As a result alcohol drinks are perhaps being spiked or, in other words, bootleg alcohol (using methanol) is being produced and used in some regions. Second, is the misconception among the public that drinking alcohol-based drinks may be protective against COVID-19 and thus causing an increase in the use of alcoholic drinks. Finally, Increased unstructured leisure time, decreased sports activity due to closure of gyms and the mass advertisement to the public to remain home, have all led to increased use of alcohol drinks3\n,\n4 and this has added more difficulty to the fight against the COVID-19 issue in our region.",
