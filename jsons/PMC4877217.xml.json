First, a SnaBI restriction site was inserted at the end of the open reading frame (ORF) encoding MBP in pKM596 [14] using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with primers PE-2852 and PE-2853 (Table 1\n) to generate the plasmid pSRK2704. In the next step, the C terminus of MBP in pSRK2704 was further extended to include an in-frame 3C protease recognition site followed by a His6 tag by PCR restriction cloning using PE-42, PE-2886, and PE-2887 primers (Table 1). The PE-42 primer was designed to anneal just proximal to the BglII site in the malE gene, whereas PE-2886 and PE-2887 were partially overlapping reverse primers that were employed to engineer the desired insertions (3C site and His6 tag) followed by a SnaBI restriction site. The PCR amplicon, consisting of a C-terminal portion of the MBP ORF from pKM596 joined in-frame to a sequence encoding GGGLEVLFQ/GPHHHHHHYV, was digested with BglII and SnaBI and then cloned between the same sites in pSRK2704 to yield the destination vector pSRK2721 (Table 2\n). The \u201cYV\u201d residues shown above are cloning artifacts derived from the SnaBI site. The rhinovirus 3C protease recognition site is underlined, and the cleavage site is marked by a forward slash (see above).",

            "text": "A kanamycin-resistant plasmid with a p15A origin of replication and an l-arabinose-inducible promoter was created as described previously with slight variations [18]. In the initial step, the desired insertion sequence (p15A ori) was PCR-amplified using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The forward and reverse primers for creating a \u201cp15A mega primer\u201d were pSAMRFFwd and pSAMRFRev, respectively (Table 1). The reaction setup, cycling method, and template DNA were the same as described previously [18]. This mega primer amplicon was used as complementary primers in a subsequent QuikChange Lightning reaction (Agilent Technologies) to bring about the desired change in the target plasmid. The QuikChange Lightning reaction mix consisted of the target DNA template (50 ng) and the mega primer amplicon (350 ng) along with other PCR components. The cycling method was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 30 s (segment 1); 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 52 \u00b0C for 1 min, 68 \u00b0C for 7 min (segment 2 for 5 cycles); 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, 68 \u00b0C for 7 min (segment 3 for 13 cycles). The target plasmid in the QuikChange reaction was pBLN200\u2013GFPmut2\u2013Car9 [13] in our reaction mix instead of pET-28a(+) in the earlier method [18]. The pBLN200\u2013GFPmut2\u2013Car9 is a derivative of pET-24a(+) and carries the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter and the araC gene instead of the T7 promoter. Thus, effectively the ColE1 replicon in pBLN200\u2013GFPmut2\u2013Car9 was replaced with the p15A replicon. The modified vector, pSRK2738 (Table 2), was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Induction of the vector with l-arabinose was confirmed by monitoring the fluorescence of the GFPmut2 protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies). Next, the 3C protease ORF, bracketed by NdeI and XhoI sites, was amplified by PCR, cleaved with these restriction enzymes, and inserted between the same sites in pSRK2738 to generate the l-arabinose-inducible, untagged 3C protease expression vector pSRK2751 (Table 2).",

The mixture of cell suspensions was lysed with an APV-1000 homogenizer (Invensys APV Products, Albertslund, Denmark) at 69 MPa and centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm polyethersulfone membrane and applied onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The column was washed to baseline with buffer A containing 25 mM imidazole and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole in buffer A to 250 mM. The column effluent contained the MBP and 3C protease. The eluted fractions containing the His6-tagged proteins were pooled and concentrated using a 10-kDa MWCO (molecular weight cutoff) membrane (Millipore). The concentrated protein was diluted with buffer A to reduce the imidazole concentration to approximately 25 mM and was digested overnight with His6-tagged TEV protease [19] at 4 \u00b0C. The digest was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap FF column to capture the cleaved His6 tag and the His6 TEV. The column effluent contained the pure protein of interest. The effluent was concentrated and incubated overnight with 10 mM dithiothreitol at 4 \u00b0C.

The purpose of the MBP tag is to enhance the solubility and promote the proper folding of the passenger protein [4], [11], [20]. The 3C protease site allows the MBP moiety to be separated from the His6-tagged passenger protein prior to IMAC. This has two benefits. First, it enables one to determine whether or not the passenger protein will precipitate when it is released from MBP before any chromatographic steps are performed. Second, it helps to alleviate the propensity of MBP to stick to and copurify with some passenger proteins, probably because such an interaction is less likely to persist once the two fusion partners are no longer covalently attached to one another. After IMAC purification of the His6-tagged passenger protein, the His6 tag is removed by His6-tagged TEV protease. In the final step, the cleaved His6 tag and the TEV protease are adsorbed by another IMAC step, leaving just the pure untagged passenger protein in the column effluent.",

            "text": "The extraordinary ability of MBP to enhance the yield and promote the solubility of its fusion partners is well documented [14], [20], [23], but it is not a particularly good affinity tag for protein purification. Therefore, we and others have employed a generic strategy for protein expression and purification that combines the solubility-enhancing benefit conferred by MBP with the powerful advantage of immobilized metal affinity chromatography by using a polyhistidine tag in a tandem configuration with MBP (His6\u2013MBP) [5], [6], [7]. Although frequently successful, this approach has two potential pitfalls. First, many aggregation-prone proteins that can be rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP subsequently precipitate after they are separated from the solubility enhancer. Second, MBP has a tendency to form noncovalent complexes with some passenger proteins, which complicates their downstream purification. The first problem occurs when passenger proteins are unable to fold properly, either spontaneously or with the assistance of endogenous chaperones, once the competing kinetic pathway of aggregation is blocked by fusing them to MBP [11]. Currently, there is no generally effective solution to this problem. However, the method reported here, in which MBP is cleaved from the passenger protein in the crude cell extract, enables many of these \u201cdead end\u201d cases to be spotted very early, prior to purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography. Still, occasionally a passenger protein may remain soluble but be biologically inactive after it is released from MBP, possibly because fusion to MBP enables certain proteins to evolve into kinetically trapped folding intermediates that are no longer susceptible to aggregation. Therefore, it is advisable to employ a biological assay, if possible, at an early stage to confirm that the passenger protein is properly folded. The second advantage of cleaving the MBP fusion protein prior to affinity purification is that this reduces the tendency of MBP to \u201cstick\u201d to the cleaved passenger protein during its purification. This characteristic of MBP may be related to the mechanism by which it promotes solubility and inhibits aggregation, which is thought to involve the formation of transient complexes between MBP and partially folded passenger proteins [11].",

The most likely explanation for this is that some of the fusions exist in the form of soluble aggregates, thereby masking the cleavage site. We have also observed cases in which a His6\u2013MBP fusion protein binds readily to IMAC (e.g., Ni-NTA) resin, whereas the corresponding His6 fusion protein generated after 3C cleavage does not. This could be due to obstruction of the His6 tag when it is present on the N terminus of the passenger protein as opposed to when it is attached to the N terminus of MBP. This is exemplified by DUSP14 (see Fig. S3A in supplementary material). Inefficient binding of a His6-tagged passenger during IMAC is not necessarily indicative of an unfolded protein, however, because at least some of the unbound His6 DUSP14 was enzymatically active (data not shown).",

However, the method presented here has two noteworthy advantages. First, 3C protease is used instead of TVMV protease to separate MBP from the His-tagged passenger protein. 3C protease is superior to TVMV protease because it is highly active at low temperature [21]. Consequently, the reaction proceeds efficiently on ice. Moreover, in Donnelly and coworkers' method the fusion protein is cleaved by TVMV protease inside intact cells. Yet expression of the TVMV protease is constitutive, resulting in the rapid cleavage of MBP fusion proteins following their translation. There is significant evidence to suggest that the longer a protein remains fused to MBP, the more likely it is to fold correctly [22]. Although delayed induction of the 3C protease gene on the plasmid pSRK2751 with arabinose was intended to solve this problem, unfortunately enough protease was produced in the absence of inducer to cleave a substantial portion of a well-expressed MBP\u2013sfGFP fusion protein in vivo (Fig. 4). Hence, we recommend employing the novel co-lysis method of 3C protease cleavage instead.",

For example, MBP fusion proteins expressed in insect cells or other hosts could be co-lysed with E. coli cells containing 3C protease if desired; it is not necessary to develop a means of coexpressing 3C protease in each different host. Moreover, although the attrition rate may seemingly appear higher than that associated with the use of a dual His6\u2013MBP tag and a single protease, proteins that cannot be purified using the dual protease approach very likely would also prove to be problematic when the more conventional approach is employed, only at a later stage and after a considerably greater expenditure of time and effort.",
