The role of nucleic acids and proteins has been the subject of intense research and development. The synthetic advances have fueled the emergence of several powerful tools for the identification of carbohydrate structure, function and interactions with other biomolecules. In turn, these tools, have allowed more discoveries. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology areas have seen several fundamental breakthroughs in genomics and proteomics. Detailed pictures of interactions of nucleic acids and proteins with each other or with themselves are starting to emerge (Fig. 1) . These insights have led to the identification of many therapeutic approaches and opportunities. Glycomics, however, has been less understood, which leaves important areas of research and many therapeutic opportunities untapped.",

If the understanding of the biological role of carbohydrates is to approach that of nucleic acids and proteins, access to well-defined pure oligosaccharide structures will have to be improved. Compared to the other two biopolymers, the availability of a wide range of pure and defined oligosaccharides has been lagging behind. Several facts are responsible. First, there is no amplification system analogous to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nucleic acids. Second, carbohydrates have been difficult to isolate from natural sources because of their often-heterogeneous nature. There is no recombinant DNA technique to produce them like for proteins. Third, the chemical synthesis of carbohydrates has been more challenging than that of peptides and oligonucleotides. Unlike amino acids and nucleotides, monosaccharides have several possible points of attachment and the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bonds has to be defined. The lack of information regarding the structure of oligosaccharides has aggravated this situation. While the sequencing of samples of oligonucleotides and proteins is routine and has been automated, carbohydrate sequencing has been particularly challenging. More breakthroughs will be needed in this field even though progress is being made [2] .",

The basic idea of automation has now attracted the attention of several groups and drastically different approaches are being pursued in this direction. The group of Takahashi focused on automated parallel solution-phase synthesis of oligosaccharides based on a one-pot procedure [6] . A reactivity-based onepot reaction has been pursued by Wong [7, 8] . Several groups are working on 292 B. Castagner \u00b7 P.H. Seeberger a fluorous linker-based strategy for carbohydrate synthesis that is potentially amenable to automation [9] [10] [11] . Nishimura's group developed the \"Golgi\" apparatus [12] based on enzymatic glycosylations. The basis of automation of oligonucleotides and peptides was the use of solid phase synthesis, where excess of reagents can be used to drive the coupling reactions to completion and no purification is necessary between the different steps. Solid phase oligosaccharide synthesis [13] has been performed since the early 1970s [14] , but was not automated until 2001 [15] . The general scheme is depicted in Fig. 2 . A linker is glycosylated followed by removal of excess reagent by washing. Then, a deprotection step reveals a new acceptor hydroxyl group. This cycle is repeated as many times as needed, after which, the resin-bound carbohydrate is cleaved from the solid support. Purification and deprotection yields an oligosaccharide that can be used in several different experiments. Several aspects of automated solid phase synthesis of oligosaccharides will be discussed here.",

A detailed statistical analysis (Seeberger, unpublished results) of the online database glycosciences.de [25] revealed that a far smaller number of building blocks would be necessary to construct a large fraction of the mammalian N-and O-linked oligosaccharides. In fact, a set of 25 building blocks would suffice to assemble 60% of the 3266 mammalian oligosaccharides contained in the database, and 65 building blocks would enable access to 90% of these oligosaccharides. A ranking of the most important monosaccharide units by abundance is depicted in Table 1 . Several building blocks giving access to these linkages have already been successfully used on solid support. A building block for automated solid phase synthesis needs to meet several criteria: it must contain a stable anomeric leaving group that can easily be activated. The temporary protecting group should easily be removed for the next glycosylation but needs to be stable to the glycosylation conditions. The glycosylation should be stereoselective, which usually implies an ester participating group on the C2 hydroxyl. The two types of anomeric leaving groups used for automated synthesis are glycosyl phosphates and glycosyl trichloroacetimidates.",

The Fmoc group [46, 51, 53] can be removed by treatment with weak amine bases such as piperidine or triethylamine, and is orthogonal to levulinoate esters that require stronger basic conditions. The Fmoc deprotection is very rapid and can be quantitated by UV analysis.
