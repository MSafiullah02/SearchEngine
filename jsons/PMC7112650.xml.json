Until an effective vaccine is developed, the best hope for the treatment of infection and the prevention and control of future outbreaks remains the development of passive immunotherapy with SARS-CoV-specific antibodies (Holmes, 2003). It has been suggested that protection might be afforded by passive immunotherapy with concentrated SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies (Li et al., 2003a), and reports have established that infected individuals can benefit from treatment with serum from recovered patients (Pearson et al., 2003). Recently, it was also reported that viral replication was inhibited in the lower respiratory tract of na\u00efve mice if they underwent passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies present in immune serum derived from infected mice (Subbarao et al., 2004). A monoclonal antibody developed from a human non-immune single chain variable region (scFv) library has also been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, strengthening the argument that passive immunotherapy with highly specific mAbs might be very effective in controlling SARS-CoV infection (Sui et al., 2004).",

Since the development of serum antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV can take 1\u20133 weeks (Li et al., 2003a), assays that can accurately detect the presence of viral nucleic acids or proteins may be preferred for rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. The profiles of antibody responses to SARS-CoV have been well established (Li et al., 2003a). Analyses have also identified viral proteins that might serve as the best markers for immunological detection of infection by SARS-CoV (Tan et al., 2004, Lu et al., 2004). Similarly, the characterization of immunogenic peptides derived from SARS-CoV structural proteins has also allowed for the identification of epitopes that are recognized by antibodies present in patient serum (Wang et al., 2003). With this knowledge, the development of mAbs that can be used for both diagnostic assays and clinical treatments should be an attainable goal.",

Numerous reports exist, which characterize antibodies raised against surrogate SARS-CoV immunogens. Examples include polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides and a recombinant SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (Chang et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2003), and monoclonal antibodies raised against a SARS-CoV-derived recombinant protein fragment (Zhou et al., 2004). Similarly, a neutralizing mAb specific for the spike protein, derived from na\u00efve human phage display libraries, has been developed and characterized (Sui et al., 2004). Little has been published on mAbs developed to the native viral particle. The relevant immunogenetic characteristics of a panel of nine murine mAbs raised to whole SARS-CoV, six of which can effectively neutralize the virus in vitro, are presented. This development provides a distinct advantage in the search for an effective passive immune therapy, because these mAbs were raised against the intact virus, rather than any individual viral protein or immunogenic peptide.",

(H37-Ra) from Difco (BD, Oakville, ON). Thirty days later, the mice received 50 \u03bcg of SARS-CoV S.C. in Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (F.I.A.) in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. The mice received 5 \u03bcg of the same antigen in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl S.C. with F.I.A. on days 48 and 63. The mice received a final booster inoculation intraperitoneal (I.P.) with 5 \u03bcg of highly purified SARS-CoV in 200 \u03bcl PBS 3 days before euthanization by anesthesia overdose, spleen removal, and subsequent hybridoma fusion. After hybridoma fusion and establishment of stable clones, the hybridoma supernatants were screened via ELISA using purified SARS-CoV as the target antigen, and isotyped with a commercial murine isotyping dipstick test (Roche), facilitating the selection of appropriate primers for subsequent RT-PCR. Monoclonal antibodies were produced in medium scale in 450 and 800 cm2 sterile disposable roller bottle flasks (Corning). Roller bottles containing 200 ml of complete hybridoma media [BD-Quantum yield (VWR, Canada), 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, Montreal), 10% Biogro-Hybridoma serum-free supplement (Biogro Technology, Winnipeg)] were inoculated with 50 ml of hybridoma cells such that a final concentration of more than 1 million viable cells/ml was achieved. The cultures were allowed to grow to extinction and were harvested at 7\u201310 days post-inoculation. Supernatants were clarified by removing cell mass by centrifugation, and concentrated on Amicon 8400 stirred cell Ultrafiltration-nitrogen concentrators (VWR, Canada) with a YM-30 (Millipore, USA) membrane. Individual membranes were used for the concentration of each mAb. The concentrated supernatants were mixed 1:1 with protein A-binding buffer (Pierce) and purified on a equilibrated 1 or 5 ml protein G-sepharose column (Amersham Biotech) as per the manufacturers instructions. Eluted antibody was dialyzed to remove salt using Centriprep YM-30 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore) with a 30 kDa cutoff. The mAb solutions were filter sterilized through low-protein-binding 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filters (VWR). Protein concentration was determined using the micro-bca assay (Pierce) and the IgG concentration was standardized to 1 mg/ml in sterile PBS (Gibco).",

Reactions were incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. RNA was removed from the reactions by incubating them with RNaseH (Invitrogen) at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and various 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primers specific for VH and VL genes and. The primers used are as follows (in 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 orientation), and are described in detail elsewhere (Berry, 1999, Barbas et al., 2001, Dattamajumdar et al., 1996).

The sequences, aligned via ClustalW as described above, were analyzed via neighbor joining analysis, bootstrapped using 1000 replicates. The na\u00efve human mAb 80R (Sui et al., 2004; VH GenBank accession no. AAS19425; VL GenBank accession no. AAS19432) was initially used as an outlier sequence. This mAb was chosen because it is specific for the SARS-CoV spike protein and neutralizes SARS infection in vitro, but it was developed from a non-immune human single chain variable fragment (scFv) library. A second outlier, also human in origin, was found as follows. The VL and VH amino acid sequences of F26G18 were compared against the human Ig sequences in the NCBI databases using IgBlast, as described above. F26G18 was chosen because it was the most potent SARS neutralizing murine mAb isolated, and it is specific for spike. Human antibodies were chosen to ensure that similarity would be minimal, considering that mouse, and indeed human, antibodies inherently share considerable homology regardless of their specificity. The sequences that showed the lowest homology to the VH and VL sequences of F26G18 were chosen as follows: VL: GenBank accession no. BAC01727, level of identity: 83/115 amino acids; VH: GenBank accession no. CAD19025, level of identity: 83/132 amino acids.

Examining the VH chains, only two Ig V-gene families are represented. Eight out of the nine mAbs share high sequence identity with the J558 V-gene family, with the remaining mAb, F26G1, sharing high sequence identity with the VOx-1 gene. Of the J558 V-gene family members, five of the eight mAbs are most closely related to the J558.50 V-gene, and this set of five mAbs neutralizes SARS-CoV in vitro. mAbs F26G6, F26G8 and F26G3 are most closely related to the J558.33 and J558.5 V-genes, respectively, which are themselves closely related to J558.50. A closer analysis of the VH chains of mAbs sharing significant homology with the J558.50 V-gene is presented in Fig. 1\nand Table 2\n. An alignment of the nucleotide sequences of these VH sequences reveals a very high level of identity (Fig. 1A). Similarly, at the amino acid level, these sequences share considerable identity both amongst themselves and with the J558.50 V-gene (Fig. 1B), with some mutation away from the germline sequence, which is typical of immunoglobulin V-gene cDNAs from T-dependant B cell responses (Fish and Manser, 1987). A quantification of the level of identity of these sequences is summarized in Table 2. An analysis of the J-genes shows that three JH genes are represented in the VH chains, at a relatively even distribution. There appears to be a slight bias towards JH4 (four mAbs) with JH1 (three mAbs) and JH2 (two mAbs) also represented (Table 1). Analysis of the CDR-3 sequences reveals that DH-regions are present in seven out of nine of the mAbs, with homology to numerous DH-gene sequences available in the databases. A detailed analysis of the DH-regions is presented in the following section.",

Both VH CDR-1 and CDR-2 exhibit high levels of identity, with all of the neutralizing mAbs showing remarkable sequence conservation, while VH CDR-3 shows a high level of sequence diversity. One neutralizing mAb F26G3 shares little identity with any of the other neutralizing mAbs because it is derived from a different germline VH allele (see the following section for a more detailed analysis of this mAb). The most closely related VL sequences are F26G7/F26G19 (98% identical), F26G9/F26G10 (96% identical), and F26G6/F26G8 (90% identical).

Across the full length of VH, it is evident that the average level of identity is highest amongst the neutralizing mAbs, albeit by a small margin (Fig. 3A). An examination of the VH CDRs reveals that CDR-1 and CDR-2 exhibit the highest level of sequence identity, whether subdivided into groups containing all mAbs, neutralizing mAbs, or non-neutralizing mAbs. However, this finding is most apparent when examining the neutralizing mAbs, whose CDR-1 and CDR-2 regions share 73% and 82% average sequence identity, respectively. On the other hand, CDR-3 exhibits the highest sequence variability, whether grouped into all mAbs, neutralizing mAbs, or non-neutralizing mAbs, with an average level of identity ranging from 24% to 47%. An extended CDR-3 domain is characteristic of the VH chains of the SARS-CoV neutralizing mAbs. This domain of the neutralizing mAbs contains, on an average, 12 amino acid residues, while the average amongst all of the mAbs is 10 residues (not including D-element negative clones F26G6 and G8). The CDR-3 regions of the non-neutralizing mAbs contain only five residues. The VL regions exhibit a lower average level of sequence identity, as outlined in Fig. 3B. As with the VH sequences, the highest average level of identity across the full length of the VL sequences is exhibited by the neutralizing mAbs. However, the average level of sequence identity is lower overall in the VL sequences than in the corresponding VH sequences (Fig. 2A and compare Fig. 3A and B). Unlike the VH sequences, there is no clear bias towards a higher level of identity in the CDRs, with all three CDRs sharing relatively low average sequence identity, regardless of the grouping of the mAbs into all, neutralizing, or non-neutralizing categories. This finding again suggests that the VL CDRs likely influence the neutralization ability of the mAbs to a lesser extent than the VH CDRs.",

As shown in this table, the neutralizing titre varies from a low of 0.075 nM (F26G18) to a high almost 350-fold greater, at 26 nM (F26G3). As a comparison, it was recently reported that a human mAb, 80R, developed from a na\u00efve human immune scFv library and specific for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding domain of spike, exhibited a neutralizing concentration as low as 0.37 nM (Sui et al., 2004). The relationship between F26G18 and the rest of the neutralizing mAbs was therefore examined as an attempt to identify any common theme or relationship that exists amongst them. Clearly, mAb F26G3 is least related to F26G18 or any of the other neutralizing mAbs, in both the VH and VL chains (Table 3). Examining the VH chains, the average level of identity (compared to F26G18) for all of the neutralizing mAbs is high across the entire sequence of the VH chain, and within CDR-1 and CDR-2. Conversely, CDR-3 is the least closely related region in all of the neutralizing mAbs. The same pattern is evident when the average level of sequence identity of the VH chains across all mAb sequences is examined (Fig. 3A). Examining the VL chains, the average level of identity between the rest of the neutralizing mAbs and F26G18 is relatively low (Table 3), which is similar to the relatively low average level of identity exhibited by all of the mAbs in the panel (Fig. 3B). The average level of identity in CDR-1 and CDR-2 of VL is lower, compared to F26G18, than the corresponding regions in VH, while CDR-3 exhibits a higher average level of identity. In the VL chains, a slightly lower average level of identity is evident in CDR-2, compared to CDR-1 and CDR-3; however, this is far less noticeable than the difference in relatedness between CDR-3 compared to CDR-1 and CDR-2 in the VH chains.",

Neutralization titres amongst the mAbs vary from the lowest, at 0.075 nM for F26G18, to a high of 26 nM, for F26G3. Interestingly, two of the mAbs that exhibit the highest neutralizing efficiency, F26G18 and F26G19, are specific for the spike protein (Berry et al., 2004). As has been established conclusively, spike is required for binding of SARS-CoV to its receptor, ACE2, and mAbs that block this interaction can neutralize SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003b, Sui et al., 2004). These results suggest that F26G18 and F26G19 likely neutralize SARS-CoV infection by directly targeting spike, although whether the interaction between spike and its receptor is targeted specifically remains to be determined, and ongoing work to answer this question is in progress. Although five of the mAbs are confirmed to be spike-specific, three of these (F26G1, F26G6, and F26G8) are unable to neutralize SARS-CoV infection in vitro. These results suggest that this panel of mAbs recognizes a diverse set of epitopes within the spike protein, some of which are in regions of spike that are not involved in viral adhesion or other steps in the infection process. Of the panel of six neutralizing mAbs, the targets of four have not yet been identified, and work is currently underway to determine them.",

Conversely, all three CDRs of the VL chains exhibit similar levels of sequence identity, which are, on average, lower than the levels of identity in the corresponding VH regions. The variability in CDR-3 of the VH chains is therefore likely a significant contributing factor to the target specificity of these mAbs, and the VL CDRs likely influence the neutralization ability of the mAbs to a lesser extent than the VH CDRs. The average length of CDR-3 also appears to influence neutralizing ability. The VH CDR-3 of the neutralizing mAbs contains more amino acids than the average number in the whole panel of mAbs, while the CDR-3 regions of the non-neutralizing mAbs contain fewer residues. Conversely, the average length of VL CDR-3 is constant.

The clustering of the sequences of the neutralizing mAbs based on their relatedness to F26G18 tends to correlate well with their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro. For both VH and VL, the mAb with the lowest neutralizing efficiency, F26G3, has the lowest overall sequence identity when compared to mAb F26G18, and when compared to the average sequence identity across the whole panel of neutralizing mAbs. This trend is more apparent for the VH sequences, since the percentage of identity of the VL chains relative to F26G18 is lower overall. This observation is consistent with the dominant role of VH compared to VL in previously identified neutralizing mAbs against a viral pathogen (Barbas et al., 1993). CDR-1 and CDR-2 of the VH chains of the neutralizing mAbs are most closely related to the same regions in F26G18, while CDR-3 is less conserved. From this analysis, one can infer that high homology in VH CDR-1 and CDR-2 (relative to F26G18) of the neutralizing mAbs appears to correlate with neutralizing ability. Interestingly, F26G7 exhibits a six-fold higher neutralizing titre than F26G19, even though their sequences are closely related both to each other and to F26G18, revealing that the trend for relatedness to F26G18 correlating with neutralizing ability does not follow for all of the mAbs in this panel. This observation also suggests that small changes in the amino acid composition of these mAbs can significantly alter neutralization efficiency. Overall, this analysis clearly demonstrates that the VH regions of the neutralizing mAbs are more highly related than the VL chains, and suggests that the sequence of the VL chains plays a smaller role in neutralizing ability than the VH chains.",

First, each pair might have originated from the same B cell progenitor and they are clonally related (Fish et al., 1989), with the few observed sequence variations resulting from somatic mutation. Second, identical CDR-3 rearrangements might have occurred in the B cell progenitors, and antigen selection may have produced several independently rearranged but closely related B cell clones. Third and alternatively, sequence changes might have occurred during reverse transcription or PCR amplification, and the mAbs originated from the same, independently picked hybridoma clone. While these analyses do not allow a differentiation between these potential causes of this high sequence similarity, we would speculate that the first explanation is most likely true.",

            "text": "The VH chains of eight of the mAbs belong to the J558 V-gene family, and six of these mAbs neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro. This result suggests that a small pool of B cells, expressing related Ig V-genes, was selected for in response to exposure to SARS-CoV. This is not entirely surprising, considering that the J558 V-gene family is estimated to contain several hundred members in the genome of the BALB/c mouse (Livant et al., 1986) and this family is highly selected in murine B cells (Haines et al., 2001). It is clear that a restricted pool of VH genes was selected to encode SARS-CoV neutralizing mAbs. A bias towards the selection of genes in the J558 V-gene family to generate autoantibodies in the tight-skin mouse has also been reported (Kasturi et al., 1994). JH gene usage is distributed relatively evenly in the mAbs generated during this work, which agrees well with the observation that JH gene usage in several murine innate antibodies belonging to the J558 V-gene family, is approximately evenly distributed (Seidl et al., 1999). These results suggest that a typical variety of joining (J) genes is selected during the generation of VH chains in these clones. Conversely, a bias was evident in the selection of J genes in the generation of the VL chains in these clones, which agrees with published reports of preferential selection of Jk1 and Jk2 genes in adult mouse splenic cells (Wood and Coleclough, 1984, Nishi et al., 1985). This observation suggests that the VL chains of these mAbs appear to be derived from a more diverse pool of V genes, and may be less critical for contributing contact residues, relative to VH, for binding to SARS-CoV proteins. A complete absence of DH-regions, and as a result a small CDR-3 in the V-domain, in two of the non-neutralizing, spike-specific mAbs, F26G6 and F26G8, suggests that this region contributes significantly to neutralization. The diversity of the length, sequences, and apparent order of assembly of the DH-regions present in these mAbs suggests that significant somatic alteration of sequences flanking the DH-regions occurred during junctional assembly, or that somatic mutations occurred during affinity maturation in a germinal center. The presence of identical DH elements in the CDR-3 regions of F26G7/F26G19 and F26G9/F26G10 supports the notion that these pairs are clonally related, and derived from the same parental V-gene rearrangement.",

The majority of the VH chains of the neutralizing mAbs share significant homology to the J558 Ig V-gene family, suggesting selection of a limited pool of V-genes occurred in mice exposed to highly purified SARS-CoV. High levels of sequence identity in CDR-1 and CDR-2 of the VH chains, compared to low levels of sequence identity in all of the VL chains, suggests that neutralization ability is imparted to these mAbs by contact residues within the VH chains. Chain shuffling experiments will be employed to determine the relative contributions of the VH and VL chains to SARS-CoV neutralization (Berry et al., 2003).",

The development of the mAbs reported here is an important first step in isolating mAbs generated against the intact SARS virus that could be used for passive immunotherapy. Humanization of murine mAbs is a viable method for the development of potential passive immunotherapeutics (Roguska et al., 1994, Rader et al., 1998), and these methods can be applied to the mAbs developed in this work. One caveat to this analysis is that it is not an exhaustive statistical analysis of the relationships between the mAbs described here. Due to the small numbers of mAbs examined, only trends and general relationships regarding the levels of sequence identity between any of the mAbs and their immunological properties can be inferred. Regardless, this analysis provides a useful summary of murine mAbs that possess the potential for development into viable immune therapies and diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV infection. The recurrent usage of particular murine V-gene elements to encode virus-neutralizing antibodies is becoming more evident and detailed molecular analyses become available (Kalinke et al., 1996). Studies with animal models are currently underway to determine the in vivo neutralization properties of the neutralizing mAbs summarized here.",
