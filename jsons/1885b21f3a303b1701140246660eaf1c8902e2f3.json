The autosomal dominantly inherited MC4R variants cause obesity by causing hyperphagia and decreased sense of satiety. Homozygous variants are rarely reported, and they cause earlier/severe obesity. Our objective is to determine the MC4R gene variant frequency in children and adolescents with familial early-onset obesity. One hundred thirty-nine children and adolescents (57 girls/82 boys) whose weight increase started before the age of 5 years and who had early-onset obesity in at least one of their first-degree relatives were included in the study. Obesity is defined as body mass index (BMI) of \u2265 95th percentile, and as extreme obesity is defined if the BMI \u2265 120% of the 95th percentile or \u2265 35 kg/m 2 . Children having genetic syndromes associated with obesity and mental retardation or taking drugs that promote changes in eating behavior or weight were excluded from the study. Coding region of the MC4R gene was sequenced by using the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencing System. The mean age of the patients was 7.3 \u00b1 3.7 years, and the mean BMI SDS was 3.7 \u00b1 0.7. While 118 patients (85%) were prepubertal, 21 patients (15%) were pubertal. Seven different variants were identified in 12 patients by giving a variant detection rate of 8.6%, of these five were previously identified missense variants p.N274S, p.S136F, p.V166I, p.R165W, and p.I291SfsX10. One homozygous variant p.I291SfsX10 (c.870delG) was detected in a severely obese 2-year-old boy, and other variants were heterozygous. Two novel variants were found: p.M200del and p.S188L. By using the in silico analysis software, these novel variants were predicted to be disease causing.",

Body weight, height, and BMI's SD scores were calculated using Turkish national anthropometric references [12] . Blood pressure values above 95th percentile according to age, sex, and height were accepted as hypertensive [13] . Blood glucose, insulin, and serum lipid levels measured at admission during morning fasting were recorded from the file data. Homeostasis model assessment that shows the insulin resistance is calculated by the following formula: insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) value = fasting blood glucose (mg/dl) \u00d7 0.055 \u00d7 fasting insulin (mIU/ ml)/22.5. In a systemic review including 8732 children and adolescents, the value of HOMA-IR associated with metabolic syndrome ranges from 2.30 to 3.54 [14] .

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MC4 gene are also related to obesity and its metabolic complications [28] . Previously, Demiralp D et al.

In their study, they showed that p.V103I polymorphism was 4.5% in complicated obese children and p.E42K polymorphism was 9% in familial obese children and 1.5% in complicated obese children. De Rosa et al. [30] study 312 African American and Latino children with severe nonsyndromic obesity, and their variant rate was 2.6%. In the recent study by Tun\u00e7 et al. [31] , MC4R gene variant was investigated in 47 morbid obese children. This study composed of the cases that have the same ethnic origin, and the variant rate was given as 8.5% that is very similar to the present study [28] . Ak\u0131nc\u0131 et al. [32] study 105 patients with severe (BMI > 3) early-onset obesity for 41 previously known obesity-related genes by targeted next-generation sequencing analysis, and they found monogenic obesity of 10.4% in Turkish population. In our study, nucleotide sequence of the coding region of MC4R was determined in 139 unrelated probands with familial early-onset obesity, and 8 (8.6%) probands with variants that alter the amino acid sequence of the receptor were found. Beckers S et al. [33] reported the frequency of polymorphism in a cohort including 123 obese children and adolescents as 3.25%, and they did not detect pathogenic MC4R variant in any case. However, in their study, the sample group consisted of only obese patients, and it did not discriminate any early-onset obesity. Farooqi et al. [10] examined the nucleotide sequence of the MC4R gene in 500 individuals with severe childhood-onset obesity. Of them 29 individuals (5.8%) had pathogenic variants in MC4R: 23 were heterozygous and 6 were homozygous. The reason of these frequency differences in the literature may be due to different inclusion criteria of studies or different ethnic origins.",

In the present study, it was found that 91.6% of the cases with MC4R variant had insulin resistance that was proven by the laboratory. HOMA-IR values were statistically higher in cases with variant compared with the cases without variants. Even though Tun\u00e7 et al. [31] reported that there was no insulin resistance in their study group, fasting insulin values were median 22.4 \u00b1 7.5 mIU/L, high for age references (0-17 mIU/L). Previous studies also reported the presence of insulin resistance in cases with MC4R variants [10, 35] . In 1362 Indian children, MC4R rs12970134 polymorphism is also related to increased insulin resistance [36] . Within the variant carrier cases in the present study, insulin resistance was determined as early as 2 years. For this reason, cases with MC4R variant should be monitored for insulin resistance and related complications from earlier age. There are a limited number of studies showing the correlation between MC4R and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. While serum free T4 levels were normal in all cases in the sample group, elevation of isolated TSH was observed in two cases, and TSH values were between 5.2 and 7.3 mIU/L in the follow-up of a case with normal autoantibody levels, thyroid ultrasonography, and urine iodine excretion. No decreased in free T4 or apparent hypothyroidism was observed. In the previous study by Farooqi S et al. [10] , isolated TSH elevation was reported in 1 of 29 patients with MC4R variant. In the study conducted by Huszar D et al. [37] on MC4R knockout mice, no correlation between the MC4R molecule and the thyroid axis was found. Vella KR et al. [38] showed in their study that mice with neuropeptide-Y and MC4R deficiency had impaired thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TSH, and thyroid hormone suppression in hypothalamo-hypophyseal areas and also neuropeptide-Y and MC4R were required for the hepatic metabolism of T4. Further studies are needed regarding the effect of the MC4R molecule on the hypothalamicpituitary-thyroid axis, which also has an effect on energy metabolism.",

This suggested that these two conditions might share common molecular pathways despite their heterogeneity. However, the pathogenesis of these correlations is not known clearly [39, 40] . Agranat-Meged A et al. [40] suggested that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was statistically significantly more frequent in the cases with C271R variant in the MC4R gene. In their study, Mergen et al. [41] showed a bipolar psychiatric disorder in a female patient who had p.N274S heterozygous variant. In the current series, a 8.5-year-old male patient had a history of 1-year follow-up for social isolation due to the diagnosis of depression by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. One patient with p.N274S variant and morbid obesity also had major depressive disorder, and he was hospitalized in an adolescent psychiatry clinic due to major depression. Whether these two conditions may be secondary to obesity, separate clinical entity, or secondary to variant in MC4R gene, it was not yet fully explained [42] [43] [44] . Further studies are required in this field.",
