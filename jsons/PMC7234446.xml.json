The virus was provisionally named novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2] to differentiate it from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4], responsible for two previous outbreaks, in 2002 and 2012, respectively [5]. Successively, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses defined it as SARS-CoV-2 [6] and the associated disease has been called 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread worldwide, forcing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March [7, 8].",

As described in a case report and a case series, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and colostrum samples collected from infected mothers were negative for COVID-19 [19, 20]. However, the question remains controversial, as IgM antibodies have been detected in newborns from mothers with COVID-19 [21], even though the probability of a false positivity should be taken in account. There is also growing evidence of cases of neonatal pneumonia which may be explained by SARS-CoV-2 infection [22, 23]. Currently in China, all newborns are separated from their infected mothers for at least 14 days [24], while the US CDC advise to consider a temporary separation between the infected mother and her infant on a case-by-case basis, using shared decision-making between the patient and the clinical team [25].",

In particular, some authors reported that up to one third of symptomatic children may have high fever [10, 77], but generally below 39 \u00b0C [38, 77]. Differently from adults, children are more likely to present with extra-respiratory symptoms [94]: diarrhea (9.4%) and vomiting (7.3%) are the most frequently reported ones. It has been showed that, when present, gastrointestinal symptoms usually anticipate the typical respiratory pattern [95]. Previous studies on SARS-CoV cases demonstrated the viral detection in gut biopsy specimens and stool of recovered patients, indicating a possible gastrointestinal tract tropism that may partially provide explanations for extra-respiratory symptoms and persistent viral shedding through fecal\u2013oral route [96]. There is growing evidence that this mechanism of excretion may be typical also for SARS-CoV-2 [2, 37]. As described in a case series of ten infected children, SARS-CoV-2 remained detectable in rectal swabs after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative [37]. However, the extra-pulmonary detection of viral RNA does not mean infectious virus is present, but two independent laboratories from China declared that they have successfully isolated live 2019-nCoV from the stool of patients (unpublished) [95]. Moreover, recent analysis revealed that ACE2 was expressed also in upper esophagus and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon [61].",

Moreover, nosocomial infection may also occur, and strict measures to reduce this risk should be always observed [24]. However, some authors hypothesized that 2019-nCoV infection and morbidity in newborns may be related to possible hypoxemia in the infected mother that increases the risk of perinatal adverse events such as birth asphyxia and premature birth [65, 98].

The sensitivity of chest X-ray is supposed to be inferior to that of CT-scan: in adults, nonspecific patchy peripheral and peri-bronchial opacities may be shown in all lung zones, according to the severity of the infection [104]. As children usually develop milder patterns of the disease, chest X-ray may fail to identify typical lesions, and it is mainly adopted in newborns and younger infants [23, 65, 69]. We identified 15% of asymptomatic children with abnormal radiological findings across all studies; however, both clinical and radiological patterns were specifically described only in a few case series, therefore this proportion of patients may be even higher. CT scan is frequently performed in children with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (up to 74% of all cases reported). The most frequently recognizable lesions are represented by GGO, with unilateral or bilateral distribution [33\u201335]. However, CT scan resulted completely normal in more than one third of asymptomatic patients who underwent this examination [10, 33\u201336, 44, 45, 55, 63]. The use of CT scan as a diagnostic screening tool in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients is supported by recent evidence showing that its sensitivity could be greater than that of real-time PCR in detecting the virus (98% vs. 71%, respectively) [105]. However, routine use of CT scan has several obvious implications, in particular in a pediatric setting where concern about unnecessary exposure to radiation source should be raised. Therefore, other possible diagnostic imaging tools may be used. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been successfully adopted in adult subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection [106]. A recently published Italian case series reported LUS findings in eight children with COVID-19 infection: subpleural consolidations and confluent B-lines were identified in all patients and results were confirmed by a chest radiography [107].",

Given the large amount of currently published papers on COVID-19, we have decided to base our research on a single but robust database. However, this strategy might implicate possible selection bias of the included studies. Moreover, our findings are essentially based on limited case series and case reports, therefore laboratory parameters of interest were not consistently reported and reference ranges were not always clearly defined. Similarly, radiological patterns were difficult to compare, as the description of the included cases was not standardized.",

This could be due either to the fact that children are less frequently exposed to the main sources of transmission (in particular, nosocomial), and that they tend to show milder symptoms, therefore may be less often tested. In symptomatic patients, laboratory and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific, but could help identifying those who are severely ill. Larger epidemiological and clinical cohort studies are needed to better understand possible implications of COVID-19 infection in children.",
