            "text": "With the current recommendations of social-distancing and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, the pandemic has significantly impacted medical practice. While most venous insufficiency cases are considered elective, delaying care may result in complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or stasis ulcer. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux results in faster wound healing 1. Consequently, it is crucial to weight the risk of delaying these cases in order to reduce viral transmission, with the benefit of reducing venous disease related complications. In accordance with state, federal and medical societies\u2019 recommendations, our institution has made drastic practice changes. This involved rescheduling all elective procedures including venous cases and postponing all venous insufficiency ultrasound studies. Patients with suspected venous stasis ulcers or DVT, are allowed to have appropriate testing, and in some instances seen in the clinic. All postponed office visits, vascular laboratory studies and procedures have been recorded in a database in order to be rescheduled once the COVID-19 related restrictions are over. Based on recent HIPAA rules modification to accommodate the COVID-19 related healthcare changes2, we have taken additional steps to accommodate non-urgent venous cases. First, patients are asked to email us photos showing their area of concern. Second, in a select group of patients with access to compatible social media services, we have allowed for video calls with providers. Third, we started incorporating secured video conference call services provided by EPIC, which has facilitated live evaluation of patients\u2019 concerns. All non-urgent patients are treated conservatively with compression, elevation, and exercise. Since the peak in Minnesota is projected to be in July 2020, our leadership has asked proceduralists to review all rescheduled and pending cases, and provide their insight regarding urgency. Cases with venous insufficiency related intractable stasis ulcers will be considered on case-by-case bases.",

Four patients with stasis ulcers have been monitored for progression, three of whom are approved for procedures. Although venous insufficiency is not an immediately limb-threatening disease, the COVID-related delay in care will certainly impact patients\u2019 quality of life. We believe that our measures will help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the care of patients with venous disease.",
