These effector T cells scan the surface of virus\u2010infected cells to detect MHC\u2010I bound peptides (pMHC\u2010I) and destroy the cells by either direct lysis or through secretion of cytokines and chemokines.1, 2 The highly polymorphic nature of the MHC\u2010I molecules allows them to present a large repertoire of peptides representing the concealed intracellular antigens of infected or transformed cells. Generating and loading these peptides into cognate MHC\u20101 binding grooves for antigen presentation defines the various steps of the MHC\u20101 antigen presentation pathway. To counter this process, viruses have evolved various strategies to circumvent what is usually a highly effective immune surveillance system in order to limit the endogenous processing and presentation of viral peptides.3, 4, 5 Indeed, members of several viral families including Herpesviridae and Retroviridae, use sophisticated mechanisms to interfere at key steps of the MHC\u2010I antigen presentation pathway in order to evade immune recognition and as a result establish lifelong persistence in their host.6 An alternative mechanism utilized by viruses to limit the supply of viral peptides for T cell recognition is the downregulation of viral protein synthesis.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Viruses that downregulate their protein synthesis at levels below the threshold required to initiate an immune response by host virus\u2010specific T cells may escape immune detection. While there has been steady progress over recent years in characterizing the successive steps underlying the antigen processing and presentation pathway, and in unraveling specialized functions of the components of the MHC\u20101 presentation pathway,2, 12 our knowledge of the impact of translational regulatory mechanisms on MHC\u20101 mediated antigen presentation remains limited.",

While the majority of EBV latent proteins elicit robust immune responses, EBV\u2010encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) a genome maintenance protein (GMP) expressed in all EBV\u2010associated malignancies, self\u2010regulates its synthesis at levels sufficient to maintain viral infection but below the level required to initiate an immune response by host virus\u2010specific T cells.8, 11, 31 The glycine\u2010alanine repeat domain (GAr) of EBNA1 was initially thought to be responsible for limiting MHC\u2010I\u2010restricted presentation of EBNA1 epitopes to CTLs due to the GAr inhibiting its own proteasomal degradation and therefore presentation of EBNA1 peptides.15, 32 Indeed, deleting the GAr was shown to alleviate the inhibitory constraint on antigen presentation.31, 33 More recent investigations have demonstrated that reduced EBNA1 MHC\u2010I peptide presentation is due to downregulated EBNA1 synthesis9, 11, 31 and questioned whether the GAr has an impact on EBNA1 turnover.34 Moreover, studies by several groups have demonstrated that EBNA1\u2010specific epitopes are derived from newly synthesized protein and have shown both in vitro and in vivo, that the GAr inhibits mRNA translation of EBNA1 in cis.\n31 These results support Yewdell's defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) hypothesis35 where DRiPs, a subset of rapidly degraded polypeptides (RDPs), supply peptides for MHC\u2010I molecules, thereby linking viral immune surveillance to translational control mechanisms and ensuring the immune system rapidly detects and eliminates virally infected cells. While the pendulum now seems to be swinging back in favor of mature functional proteins rather than DRiPs as the predominant source of MHC class I presented peptides,36, 37 recent investigations from the Khanna and Shastri group's demonstrated that EBNA1 peptide presentation is dependent on the proportion of generated DRiPs.8, 38\n",

They observed a similar \u2018stealth\u2019 strategy is exploited by EBNA1, which is uniquely expressed in the most basic form of EBV latency (latency I).40 It was proposed that the rightward transcribed (BKRF1) gene encoding EBNA1 has been under evolutionary pressure to accept mutations that increase the purine content of the top (mRNA\u2010synonymous) strand41 so that during latent infection EBNA1 evades recognition by CTLs by virtue of its purine\u2010biased GAr mRNA preventing interactions with host RNAs. Reduction of this purine\u2010bias within the GAr mRNA through codon\u2010modification dramatically reversed the inhibitory effect on EBNA1 self\u2010synthesis and antigen presentation.9 In addition, altering the peptide sequence of the native EBNA1 GAr using alternative reading frames did not alleviate the inhibition of both EBNA1 synthesis and epitope presentation,10 suggesting that regulatory structural elements within the EBNA1 GAr mRNA itself may regulate mRNA translation and antigen presentation. A subsequent analysis of the EBNA1 GAr encoding mRNA revealed that clustering of unusual RNA secondary structures, G\u2010quadruplexes, within the EBNA1 GAr encoding mRNA are involved in the cis\u2010acting translational regulation of the EBNA1 mRNA.7\n",

A second domain comprises an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that promotes translation.

In the absence of this protein, the virus replicates to similar levels in mouse lungs but shows decreased proliferation. Its expression, on the other hand, results in delayed clearance of the virus by the host immune system.64 PB1\u2010F2 was identified in the course of a systematic search for alternative reading\u2010frame peptides encoded by the IAV that are recognized by CD8+ T cells.63 A CTL peptide, (PB1\u2010F262\u201070), not corresponding to any of the known standard viral open reading frames was found. Further genomic analysis of the IAV genome revealed the PB1\u2010F262\u201070 peptide was derived from the conserved 87\u2010amino\u2010acid\u2010long PB1\u2010F2 protein encoded by the (+1) reading frame within the PB1 gene. PB1\u2010F2 and some truncation products resulting from a premature stop codon in the PB1\u2010F2 ORF can be detected in human, mouse, and avian cells infected by IAV.63 Studies involving Kozak and mutational analyses have shown that RNA structures within PB1 strongly favor translation at the (+1) reading frame's predicted PB1\u2010F2 start codon and are likely to be initiated by ribosomal scanning as opposed to internal ribosomal entry or other mechanisms.63 RNA secondary structure predictions revealed a conserved structured region at the start of the internal PB1\u2010F2 ORF for six influenza genomes comprising the human, avian and swine strains.65 This protein contributes to influenza viral pathogenicity through several mechanisms. One described mechanism is a pro\u2010apoptotic function in which PB1\u2010F2 was found to localize to Hela cell mitochondria. PB1\u2010F2 disturbs the mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in a fluctuation of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm triggering apoptosis in these cells.63 The induction of apoptosis by PB1\u2010F2 is proposed to occur specifically in immune cells in a strain dependent manner suggesting that the protein has a modulatory role in the host response to IAV by hastening the death of immune cells.63, 66 In addition to pro\u2010apoptotic activity, it has been reported that PB1\u2010F2 also has proinflammatory properties. It was observed that an asparagine (N) to serine (S) substitution at position 66 in the PB1\u2010F2 protein dramatically increased immunopathology and mortality by the 1918 pandemic strain and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.67 Also, transcriptional profiling of mice infected with a PB1\u2010F2 N66S\u2010expressing virus revealed an early suppression of interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs)68 and in vitro experiments demonstrated an anti\u2010interferon activity of PB1\u2010F2 in relation to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein.69 Of note, PB1\u2010F2 N66S inhibited IFN induction more efficiently than wild\u2010type PB1\u2010F2.69 The wild\u2010type PB1\u2010F2 protein was initially shown to be highly unstable and to undergo proteasomal dependent degradation,63 however, more recent experiments performed in murine and duck cells demonstrate that protein levels of the N66S mutant but not the wild\u2010type increase following exposure of the infected cells to the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin.70\n",

Within certain members of this viral family, G\u2010quadruplexes act as ribosomal roadblocks to prohibit a significant proportion of ribosomes from shuttling down the transcripts and in the process impede translation.7 Due to this decrease in translation, it was hypothesized that destabilization or stabilization of G\u2010quadruplex motifs may have a direct impact on the generation of antigen\u2010specific peptides. Reported observations that codon\u2010modification of the EBNA1 GAr mRNA destabilized G\u2010quadruplexes by inducing the formation of double\u2010stranded structures within the EBNA1 mRNA, prompted an assessment of the effect of potential exogenous factors such as antisense oligonucleotides to destabilize G\u2010quadruplex motifs. It was subsequently demonstrated that an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the G\u2010quadruplex motif and selected for its ability to unwind G\u2010quadruplexes in vitro, was able to increase EBNA1 mRNA translation and enhance immune recognition by antigen\u2010specific T cells in EBV\u2010infected cells (Figure 4(a)).7 This result highlighted the ability of ribosomes to process RNA double\u2010stranded structure more efficiently than G\u2010quadruplex structure. In contrast, the addition of a G\u2010quadruplex stabilizing ligand, pyridostatin (Figure 4(a)), to EBNA1 in vitro translation assays and an in vivo transfection system showed the opposite effect: a more pronounced inhibition of EBNA1 mRNA translation and a resultant decrease in virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell recognition of EBV\u2010infected cells treated with the small molecule. G\u2010quadruplex destabilization, using the antisense oligonucleotide, or stabilization, using the small molecule G\u2010quadruplex ligand, led to a 25% increase or 40% decrease, respectively, in the activation of EBNA1\u2010specific T\u2010cells in treated EBV\u2010expressing HEK293 cells. The multifunctional roles of EBNA1 in initiating EBV\u2010genome replication and episomal maintenance, while also contributing to immune evasion, suggest that this protein is a promising target for immunotherapy. Stimulation of the immune recognition of EBV\u2010infected cells through G\u2010quadruplex destabilization or inhibition of replication of the EBV genome through G\u2010quadruplex stabilization may lead to potential elimination of viral latency.",

The efficiency of frameshifting using morphilino, 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl phosphorothioate, locked nucleic acid (LNA) and RNA antisense oligonucleotides can be as high as 40% and depends on the stability of the secondary structure rather than the three\u2010dimensional structure formed.71, 72, 73 The targeted slippery sequences comprise the HIV gag\u2010pol, UUUUUUA, MMTV gag\u2010pro, AAAAAAC and RSV gag\u2010pol, AAAUUA frameshift sites. This in vitro research investigation highlights the potential of synthetic oligonucleotides to interfere with the translation of key mRNAs to insure infectivity and survival of RNA viruses. Unfortunately, at present no results for an effect on the in vivo synthesis of related MHC\u2010I restricted epitopes using this approach exist, however, one would expect that interfering with translation would ultimately affect the pool of antigenic peptides. This approach may also be used to stimulate translation at non\u2010AUG start codons by creating RNA secondary structures in close proximity of tRNA binding sites. The use of an antisense microwalk assay may allow the identification of sequences and structures controlling the synthesis of cryptic epitopes.",

In this review, we have described several mechanisms that link recently identified structural elements within viral mRNAs to protein translation and MHC\u2010I\u2010restricted antigen presentation. In particular, we have highlighted a novel function of RNA G\u2010quadruplexes within gammaherpesviral GMP transcripts through cis\u2010acting modulation of their mRNA translation and MHC\u2010I antigen presentation. Altering the translational regulatory effects of the G\u2010quadruplex motifs and their resultant impact on antigen presentation has the potential to enhance immune recognition of virally infected cells or inhibit replication of the viral genome, leading to elimination of viral latency. With no available vaccines to prevent EBV and other gammaherpesviral\u2010associated malignancies, the identification of new therapeutic targets based on RNA G\u2010quadruplex structures within viral GMP mRNAs will promote the advancement of RNA\u2010directed drug design to reduce the burden of associated viral malignancies. While recent demonstrations that an antisense oligonucleotide and a small molecule G\u2010quadruplex binding ligand can selectively target EBNA1 G\u2010quadruplexes to impact on EBNA1 synthesis, the next challenge will require rigorous assessment of the mechanistic impact and specificity of these exogenous agents in vivo.",
