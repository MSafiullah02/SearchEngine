The RBD (Receptor Binding Domain), 61 which confers binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, may be of particular interest 62 in this context. Yet, even antibodies that interfere with the fusion process (and which will not 63 directly interfere with binding) may also be of therapeutic interest and should therefore be 64 investigated.

Plasma therapy in small non-controlled series of patients with SARS-CoV-2 72 infections(Table 1)has recently also been reported, with suggested beneficial effects. conducted to date in COVID-19 patients and neither the timing of the infusions, nor the dose 75 of antibodies needed has as yet been established. Furthermore, as single donations are used 76 for a given patient, individual differences in the content of specific antibodies (titer and 77 neutralizing capacity). Thus, characterization of plasma neutralizing activity as well as the 78 number, volume and timing of plasma infusion should represent mandatory requirements in 79 the clinical trials design. A trial is currently ongoing in Italy, utilizing plasma from 80 convalescent patients with neutralizing titers > 1:160, and results will be available very soon. 81However, as of today, nobody can predict how long these titers can last. Thus, delays in 82 collecting sufficient amount of hyperimmune plasma doses might result in a shortage in the 83 unfortunate event of COVID-19 recrudescence. On the other hand, hyperimmune plasma 84 collection campaigns must rely on screening of large groups of recovered patients, something 85 that might be difficult to achieve. Finally, the presence of other plasma components may 86 theoretically affect the clinical outcome. Of particular concern is the presence of low levels or 87 low affinity antibodies that may be associated with augmentation of the infection due hyperimmune IgG preparations is another attractive form of therapy 91 both for critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and as prophylaxis in 92 immunocompromised patients. This would provide a standardized pharmaceutical product 93 that could be available within the near future, provided that a sufficient number of 94 convalescent donors could be rapidly collected. This necessitates large scale serological 95 screening by the collection centers (preferably using improved and standardized detection 96 kits) to identify suitable donors and pooling of resources and plasma by the major industrial 97 stakeholders to speed up the collection process.

In addition to a 101 higher titer of the specific antibodies, the hyperimmune IgG products, like the standard 102 preparation of normal gammaglobulin for intravenous use (IVIG), may also confer anti-103 inflammatory effects and could thus theoretically be of beneficial for COVID-19 patients in 104 order to mitigate or prevent the IL-6 associated cytokine released syndrome.

Some of the 112 monoclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-1 have shown cross-reactivity against 113 SARS-CoV-2 7 and novel monoclonal antibodies against the new virus have also been 114 generated with an astonishing speed.
