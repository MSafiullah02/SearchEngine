In these children the cough is associated with bacterial infection and/or colonisation of the conducting airways. This ranges from being transient (after a viral lower respiratory tract infection) through to the patient with severe bronchiectasis described previously. A common thread is the presence of bacteria suggesting that this is a spectrum of disease in which the manifestations can vary markedly between and within individuals over time. Prior to the \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of \u2018idiopathic bronchiectasis\u2019 being made on the basis of a HRCT scan, the patient (children and adults) may have been labelled as having recurrent viral infections, asthma, and/or chronic bronchitis.10, 11, 12 Yet it is likely the same disease process that caused them to be \u2018chesty\u2019 (with wet cough) from childhood. In two relatively large series (n = 103-150), most (60-80%) adults newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis (on HRCT) have had chronic wet cough or productive cough since childhood.13, 14\n",

The high case numbers of bronchiectasis described in the 1940 s and 1950 s2 with a seeming resurgence described from the 1990 s15, 16, 17 suggests two possibilities. Either it was under-recognised in the intervening years, when there was a co-existing strong focus on asthma, or that the widespread use of oral antibiotics in early childhood to treat \u2018viral respiratory tract infections\u2019 also treated developing persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and/or pneumonia. Eradicating bacteria prior to the formation of biofilms is theoretically easier than after the biofilms have become established and in the same way many pneumonias were probably inadvertently treated so many cases of bacterial bronchitis were probably inadvertently prevented. We speculate that the reappearance of an old disease may in part be the unintended consequence of an appropriate attempt to reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute viral respiratory tract infections. The terminology used is also confusing as it suggests that there are different diseases rather than a spectrum of clinical phenotypes with a common underlying problem. The use of some of the diagnostic terms is discussed in next section and has been summarised in a previous review.9\n",

Currently this is most commonly diagnosed by HRCT which has replaced bronchograms. The key features of bronchiectasis on HRCT scans are (a) one or more \u2018dilated\u2019 bronchi defined as the internal luminal diameters of the airways exceeding the diameter of the adjacent vessel, (b) non-tapering of the bronchi and (c) presence of visible bronchi adjacent to the mediastinal pleura or within the outer 1-2 cm of the lung fields. However, bronchiectasis (radiological diagnosis) may be reported by radiologists in patients with interstitial lung diseases (such as pulmonary fibrosis) where traction on the airways causes bronchial dilation. Traction bronchiectasis in the absence of chronic productive or wet cough will not be considered further in this paper. In children, cough is wet rather than productive, as young children usually do not expectorate,9 and following treatment the cough often temporarily resolves.4\n",

            "text": "The definitions of bronchiectasis, CSLD and PBB have limitations as their associated symptoms and signs overlap and lack specificity. Whether these conditions are different or reflect part of a spectrum of disease severity remains undetermined.9 However, we believe absolute reliance on a radiology-based definition is also unsatisfactory for the following reasons:1.It is unknown when the radiological changes consistent with bronchiectasis occur in the context of a patient with symptoms of CSLD/bronchiectasis. Adult-based studies have shown that bronchography (the previous gold standard for diagnosis of bronchiectasis) is superior to HRCT scans especially in mild disease.21, 22 Furthermore recent studies have shown that contiguous 1-mm slices are superior in diagnostic terms compared to conventional HRCT images (1 mm slice every 10 mm).23, 24 Hill et al reported that the contiguous 1-mm slices protocol (using multidetector CT scan) demonstrated 40 extra lobes with bronchiectasis not identified on conventional HRCT in 53 adults.23 False negative results are more likely to occur when the disease is mild and localised.21 As children are likely to have less severe bronchiectasis than adults, it is possible that the HRCT in a sub-group of children with clinical symptoms of bronchiectasis may still have insufficient sensitivity to detect early signs of this disorder. In addition it is more difficult to obtain appropriate full inspiratory scans in young children.2.A significant number of children have clinical characteristics of bronchiectasis but their HRCT scans do not meet the criteria for radiological bronchiectasis (Figure 1\n). HRCT findings of bronchiectasis were derived from adult studies and may not be applicable to children as airways and morphologic changes in the lung occur with maturation and aging.25, 26 One of the key HRCT signs of bronchiectasis is increased broncho-arterial ratio (defined as the diameter of the bronchial lumen divided by the diameter of its accompanying artery) of > 1-1.5. However this ratio is influenced by age 27 and we argue that a lower broncho-arterial ratio should be used in children to diagnose bronchiectasis. Extrapolation of this line suggests that the cut-off should be at 0.4-0.5 in infancy. Indeed the broncho-arterial ratio in young children (0-5 years) without CSLD symptoms was 0.49 to 0.58.28 A study based on multi-detector CT chest scans in 41 children (aged < 18 years) without pulmonary symptoms described that broncho-arterial ratio of \u2265 0.8 should be considered abnormal.29\n3.To fulfil the criteria of \u2018irreversible dilatation\u2019 at least two HRCT scans are required. Performing more than one HRCT scan purely for diagnostic reasons (as opposed to required for management reasons) in some settings is highly impractical and unnecessarily increases cancer risk from CTs in children and adolescents.30\n4.HRCT scans performed in different clinical states, such as during an acute pulmonary exacerbation, immediately following treatment or when clinically stable, may yield different results. While HRCT scans are ideally performed in a \u2018non-acute state\u2019, this is sometimes difficult to define. A \u2018non-exacerbation state\u2019 is not necessarily the same as post-treatment state. Clinicians have realised that this is a significant limitation. The Liverpool group described bronchial dilatation resolving completely in 6 of 21 children with radiologically defined bronchiectasis when HRCT scans were repeated immediately following intensive medical therapy.31 We and others have observed that radiological \u2018bronchiectasis\u2019 can resolve following appropriate treatment though this is unlikely in more advanced distortion of the conducting airways. Also, Field eluded to this pre-bronchiectatic state back in the 1940's.32\n\n",

In the mucosa of ears (which is arguably relevant to lower airways), the importance of biofilms in chronic otitis media has been described.39 In this paradigm, bronchiectasis is viewed as a radiological or pathological sign resulting from a long standing process in the same way that a myocardial infarction is an event in some patients with ischemic heart disease. As with ischaemic heart disease the paradigm of persistent bacterial bronchitis is a description of a process which can have a clinical expression from asymptomatic, minimal symptoms to life threatening severe impairment of function or premature death.40 Moreover with appropriate intervention progression can be arrested or even reversed.34, 41\n",

Two studies52, 53 have also described the high prevalence (29-50%) of bronchiectasis in adults with COPD.

From the same cohort, Svanes et al5 reported that early life disadvantage (maternal and paternal asthma, severe respiratory infections before aged 5-years, maternal smoking) were significantly associated with adult development of COPD. Longitudinal data from the Newcastle Thousand Families cohort likewise described that childhood respiratory infections contributed significantly to future adult lung function.56 Other important factors from this study56 were birth weight, breast feeding (for >4 weeks), asthma and smoking. A study from Scotland45 described that respiratory disease in early life was associated with a higher risk in adulthood of chronic productive cough, dyspnoea and doctor diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis or emphysema (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.40 to 6.95 for these outcomes). These recent epidemiological studies support older data showing that childhood pneumonia was related to poor lung function in adults with no history of wheeze.57 While recall bias is always an issue in the design of studies described here, the findings from several large studies are at least consistent and supported by animal work19 and bronchiectasis-specific literature.55\n",

Currently lobectomies or pneumonectomies for children with bronchiectasis are rarely appropriate in affluent countries37 but remain a common and important treatment option in less affluent countries.58 The fact that the natural history of bronchiectasis and mortality has altered with improvements in health and the environment suggests that with the implementation of other preventative factors, the progression of bronchiectasis could be ameliorated in the majority of children. Furthermore, there is evidence demonstrating:(a)The effect that exacerbations and/or delayed treatment is associated with lung function decline,(b)Children at risk of bronchiectasis can have normal lungs with early diagnosis and appropriate management, and(c)Appropriate treatment reduces exacerbations of bronchiectasis.\n(a)\nExacerbations and/or delayed treatment is associated with lung function decline,\n\n",

Thus, interventions that reduce exacerbations are likely to be important for later adult lung dysfunction. Furthermore, adult data has shown that recurrent exacerbations is one of the strongest predictors of poor QOL.61 Data on asthma exacerbations in child and adulthood mirrors these findings. O\u2019Byrne and colleagues described that exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or emergency treatment were associated with accelerated lung function (FEV1) decline in subjects not on preventative therapy.62 It could be argued that children with exacerbations were predestined to have lung function decline anyway, however what evidence there is suggests that children at risk of development of CSLD should receive appropriate therapies37 to improve immediate symptoms and minimise future lung dysfunction.(b)\nPeople at risk of bronchiectasis can have normal lung function with early appropriate management.\n",

A cohort study71 and one short term (6-mo) RCT72 described improvement in lung function and reduction in exacerbation frequency by 50-67% when regular azithromycin was given to adults with bronchiectasis. Whether this reduction is related to azithromycin's anti-microbial effect or the immune-modulatory influences remain to be defined.",

A Brisbane retrospective study found that 34% of exacerbations were preceded by an upper respiratory illness.4 However, a systematic study utilising modern, sensitive molecular techniques and inclusive of the more recently described viruses (eg human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (HCoV NL63 and HKU1), human bocaviruses and polyomaviruses, rhinovirus C) have not been undertaken.

Symptoms may be limited to a cough, typically a moist cough (protracted bacterial bronchitis), while in older children and those with significant damage to the conducting airways (bronchiectasis), expectoration of sputum and more persistent cough occurs. Absent or ineffective treatment regimes lead to progressive damage that can ultimately lead to severe pulmonary impairment.",
