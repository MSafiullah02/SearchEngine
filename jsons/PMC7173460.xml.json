            "text": "The WHO defines diarrhea as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. Diarrhea is the leading cause of mortality among children under 5 years of age accounting for one in ten child deaths worldwide annually. It disproportionally affects young children in low- and middle-income countries (Figure 1\n). In 2010, there were 1.731 billion episodes of diarrhea (36 million of which progressed to severe episodes) and in 2011, an estimated 700 000 deaths were due to diarrhea. Incidence and mortality from diarrhea and pneumonia vary by age (Figure 2\n) with the burden of disease mainly concentrated in the younger age groups. The epidemiology of childhood diarrhea and pneumonia overlap, likely because of shared risk factors, such as undernutrition, suboptimum breastfeeding, and zinc deficiency. Children are at the highest risk during the first 2 years of life, with 72% of deaths being secondary to diarrhea. Diarrheal mortality rates are declining by about 4% annually with disease incidence decreasing from an estimated 3.4 episodes/child-year in 1990 to 2.9 episodes/child-year in 2010. The highest burden of disease has remained consistent with respect to age in the 6\u201311-month-old age group having the highest incidence. The burden of mortality due to diarrhea in children less than 5 years of age in 2010 was highest in the WHO regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is estimated that a third of severe diarrhea episodes is preventable by vaccination (i.e., against rotavirus and cholera). Furthermore, under nutrition is a key underlying risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with both diarrhea and pneumonia. Diarrhea disease severity in children under-five is mostly mild (~ 65% cases for which no care was sought/no dehydration) lasting about 4 days or moderate (~ 35% cases for which care was sought/any dehydration on presentation) with only 0.5% of cases being severe (cases for which care was sought, with severe dehydration on presentation) and lasting 8 days. Older children and adults have predominantly mild episodes (95%) with 4.95% being moderate and 0.05% being severe. Among individuals 16 years or older, severe episodes typically last ~ 3 days and cause dehydration in ~ 93% of cases.",

Children suffering from diarrhea during the first 2 years of life might have on average an 8 cm growth shortfall and 10 IQ point decrement by the time they are 7\u20139 years old. The proposed link between enteric infections and child growth and development is a double burden of enteric infections and malnutrition, and the potential link of both of these factors to obesity later in life is an interrelated \u2018triple burden\u2019 (Figure 3\n). Important risk factors for diarrhea include lack of exclusive breastfeeding in infants younger than 6 months, undernutrition and zinc deficiency. While evidence suggests that vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of severe diarrhea, it is not an important risk factor for the incidence of diarrhea. Associations of specific water and sanitation risk factors (i.e., unwashed hands and poor water quality) with diarrhea morbidity and mortality have been shown. However, for some outcomes such as inappropriate excreta disposal, poor availability of evidence permits only rough estimates of risk. In a stratified subgroup of infants aged less than 6 months, acute lower-respiratory-tract infections are a risk factor for diarrhea. Measles is an established risk factor for diarrhea. A study from the 1980s showed that with moderate coverage of the measles vaccine (45\u201390%) in infants, the incidence of diarrhea could be reduced by 0.6\u20133.8%, and diarrhea mortality reduced by 6\u201326% in children younger than 5 years.

            "text": "Diarrhea can be classified based on duration as prolonged/acute (1\u201313 days) and persistent (14 days or more). Prolonged diarrhea can further be classified as prolonged/acute watery diarrhea which is loose or watery stools at least three times in a 24 h period or prolonged/acute invasive diarrhea which is gross blood (by history or inspection) in the stool of less than 14 days duration, typically accompanied by fever. Diarrhea can be secondary to one or more of the following pathophysiological processes: secretory, osmotic and inflammatory diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea occurs when there is a significant increase in the volume of intestinal fluid output which exceeds the reabsorptive ability of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Research initially done in patients with cholera revealed that while the secretory diarrhea in cholera does lead to significant fecal water and electrolytes loss, the gut still retains the ability to reabsorb water and electrolytes due to an intact Na-coupled solute cotransport mechanism. Chloride-mediated secretion is stimulated by second messengers in diarrheal infections secondary to Vibrio cholerae 01 and 139, Shigella, Salmonella, Escherichia coli strains and other bacterial pathogens who produce enterocyte receptor binding pathogens, causing chloride-mediated secretion stimulated by second messengers (e.g., cAMP, cGMP, and calcium). It is important to recognize that there may be a combination of osmotic and secretory diarrhea such as in the case of Rotavirus where there enterotoxin mediated secretory diarrhea along with osmotic diarrhea secondary to enterocyte damage. Phosphorylation-induced activation (by increase in cAMP, cGMP, or calcium) of these channels can be set off by exogenous or endogenous substances. Exogenous mediators include bacterial toxins such as cholera or shiga toxins, or parasites. Endogenous mediators can be endocrine, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide or serotonin, or released by the immune system, such as histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, or interleukin-1. Lastly, increased intestinal permeability due to loss of cellular tight junctions can lead to increased intestinal fluid loss (Figure 4\n).",

This can occur secondary to an absorptive defect or enzyme deficiency from pancreas or intestinal wall causing maldigestion and/or malabsorption. An osmotic gradient is created that can only be neutralized by maintaining excessive amounts of water within the intestine. Examples include, malabsorption with congenital or acquired lactase deficiency, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease) and maldigestion, as seen in pancreatic insufficiency (Figure 5\n).",

Immune cells after activation release inflammatory mediators and cytokines which stimulate secretion and activate enteric nerves. Subepithelial myofibroblasts destroy the basement membrane by metalloproteinases, damaged enterocytes are extruded, and villous atrophy develops followed by regenerative crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine and colon. These surfaces are covered with immature enterocytes that typically are deficient in the brush border enzymes and transporters necessary for absorption of nutrients and water.",

The most predominant cause of diarrhea in developing countries is infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic). A systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting etiological agents causing diarrhea in hospitalized children less than 5 years of age showed that rotavirus, calicivirus, enteropathogenic, and enterotoxigenic E. coli cause more than half of all diarrheal deaths in this age group globally. A recent 3-year prospective study in four sites in Africa (the Gambia, Mali, Mozambique, Kenya) and three in Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) showed the most attributable cases of moderate to severe diarrhea in children aged 0\u201359 months was secondary to infection with rotavirus, Shigella, ST-ETEC, cryptosporidium, and enteropathogenic E. coli. Table 3\nshows a comparison of viral, bacterial, and parasitic etiologic agents of diarrhea in developing countries and the United States. There is a seasonality in the transmission patterns of infectious agents in developing countries with bacterial diarrheas peaking in the hot months and viral diarrheas typically occurring throughout the year with some peaking in the cooler months. More than one pathogenic agent can exist with 11% (in community studies) and 12% (in hospital based studies) of diarrhea cases documented as having two or more enteric pathogens. Transmission of infectious agents causing diarrhea is primarily \u2018fecal\u2013oral\u2019 in the setting of poor hand washing hygiene, unsanitary water and dirty food preparation. The dose of infectious agent required to cause diarrhea also matters with low infectious dose (e.g., shigella, giardia, rotavirus, cryptosporidium) can be transmitted by person-to-person contact and high infectious dose (e.g., salmonella, E. coli, vibrios) usually transmitted by water or food.",

Oral rehydration solution (ORS), developed in the 1960s and 1970s by researchers in South Asia, is a simple cost-effective solution containing glucose and electrolytes that can be used to prevent and treat dehydration due to diarrhea of any cause across all ages. Development of the ORS took advantage of the glucose-coupled intestinal sodium transport mechanism discovered in the 1960s by Robert Crane. Absorption of sodium and glucose molecules across the luminal membrane is facilitated by the protein sodium glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1). Although nutrient-independent sodium absorption across the intestinal epithelial brush border membrane is impaired in diarrhea, cotransport of sodium and glucose is preserved. This allows absorption of sodium and thus water as provided by ORSs (Figure 7\n).",

There is evidence to recommend antibiotic use for reduction of morbidity and mortality due to cholera, Shigella spp. and cryptosporidium \u2013 Das et al. showed that in the developing country setting antibiotic management of cholera resulted in a 63% reduction in rates of clinical failure and a 75% reduction in rates of bacteriological failure. They also showed that antibiotic management of Shigella resulted in an 82% reduction in rates of clinical failure and a 96% reduction in rates of bacteriological failure. Antibiotics for treatment of cryptosporidiosis reduced mortality by 76%, rates of clinical failure by 52%, and rates of parasitological failure by 38%. The empiric antibiotic regimen should be determined by host factors, severity of illness, local resistance patterns, and history of travel to an area with increased resistance.",

They found that use of antiemetics significantly reduced the incidence of vomiting and hospitalization by 54% and reduced IV fluid requirements by 60%. A 2011 Cochrane Review on the use of antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents concluded that oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing IV rehydration and immediate hospital admission. IV ondansetron and metoclopramide reduced the number of episodes of vomiting and hospital admission, and dimenhydrinate as a suppository reduced the duration of vomiting. Antiemetics are effective for the management of gastroenteritis in children and have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality burden due to diarrhea.",

The series concluded that despite a large global burden childhood diarrhea and pneumonia deaths are avoidable and 15 interventions delivered at scale can prevent most of these deaths (Figures 8\nand 9\n). Estimates modeled with the Lives Saved Tool showed that if the interventions are scaled up by 80% in the 75 countdown countries, 95% of diarrheal, and 67% of pneumonia deaths in children younger than 5 years can be prevented by 2025. Scaling up of diarrheal and pneumonia interventions would cost US$ 6.715 billion, only $2.9 billion more than present levels of spending. Assessment is needed of the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in national health delivery frameworks.

Critical barriers included: absence of national coordination within ministries and other stakeholders to deliver interventions, insufficient financial resources, inadequate training and support for health workers, poor systems for monitoring and assessment of key programmatic indicators and sporadic availability of key commodities. The final list of recommendations included: (1) Improve coordination between various groups working on preventive and treatment interventions to control pneumonia and diarrhea. (2) Substantially increase resources for child survival programs, with an emphasis on pneumonia and diarrhea control efforts. (3) Enhance efforts to attract, train, and retain a competent work force of caregivers. (4) Invest in better systems for harmonization of the collection of essential programmatic indicators, and ensure that this information is shared throughout the system. (5) Strengthen supply systems that deliver essential commodities. In summary, the cost to achieve the end of preventable deaths from pneumonia and diarrhea by 2025 is estimated to be around US$ 6.715 billion. Despite large reductions in child mortality between 2000 and 2010 (both in all-cause mortality, and specifically diarrhea and pneumonia associated), these diseases remain causes for preventable deaths. The achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goal and the longer-term target of reduction of child mortality to 20 deaths or fewer per 1000 live births in all countries by 2035 requires significant decreases in mortality from both diarrhea and pneumonia. Our knowledge on diarrhea has drastically evolved over the past five decades and the present challenge is to implement these evidence-based strategies for reducing morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea.",
