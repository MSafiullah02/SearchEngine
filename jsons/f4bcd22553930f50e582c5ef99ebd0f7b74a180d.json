However, most radiologists and radiological technologists in radiology departments had less experience when facing COVID-19 patients. Examination with nonstandard prevention procedures will lead to high risks of hospital cross-infection in the radiology department. In order to effectively reduce the infection risk of radiologists and radiological technologists, a consensus on \"Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19\" was presented under the endeavors of many radiologists and radiological technologists led by the Chinese Society of Imaging Technology, Chinese Medical Association, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work in the radiology department.",
