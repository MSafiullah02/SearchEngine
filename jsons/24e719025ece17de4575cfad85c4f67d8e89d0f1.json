Mixed virus infection was observed in 36 patients (detection of RS antigen and serological response to adenovirus in eight patients; detection of RS antigen and serological response to influenza virus A/B in six patients; isolation of adenovirus and serological response to parainfluenza virus in five patients; other different mixtures with respiratory viruses and enteroviruses in 17 patients). Enteroviruses and Herpes simplex virus were isolated in 20 patients. Etiologic agents were not identified in 853 patients. We also demonstrated the number of positives for isolation of pathogens or detection of viral antigens. The rate of isolation of measles virus (100%) was the highest, while that of parainfluenza virus (9.9%) was the lowest.

            "text": "The role of virus infections in acute respiratory illnesses is common world-wide. Denny et al. 6 reported that infants usually had seven or eight respiratory illnesses each year, on average, and the frequency decreased by age in the day-care setting in the US. The incidence of infections peaked at 7-12 months of life and less than 10% of infections involved the lower respiratory tract. Viral pathogens were recovered in 31% of cases and the frequent isolates were RS virus, parainfluenza virus (particularly type 3), adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus and influenza virus with less frequency. The number of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections is limited and, thus, the results of the pathogens responsible may depend on the study design. Anderson et al. 19 reported that RS virus was isolated as yearly outbreaks; parainfluenza virus 1 and 2 infections 522 S Sonoda et al. Essentially the same seasonal pattern has been reported for the Northern hemisphere. As for the distribution of agents in different age groups, RS was mainly responsible for pathogenic agents in children under 5 years of age, parainfluenza was observed in infants 9-12 months of age, influenza virus and M. pneumonia were dominant agents in children over 5 years of age. As for the diagnostic methods, we confirmed that the serological response was poor in young infants, especially in those less than 1 year of age, as reported previously. 4 A serological response was demonstrated in 40 of 79 patients (50.6%) infected with RS virus under 1 year of age, none of four patients with influenza A and B viruses and eight of 20 patients (40%) with adenovirus, as shown in Table 3 . The rate of isolation of parainfluenza viruses was not sufficient in the present study, but we are uncertain for the reason for this. When virus isolation or detection of viral antigens was not used, etiological agents of the respiratory illness remained unidentified in approximately more than half the cases in children under 1 year of age.",
