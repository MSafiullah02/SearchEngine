            "text": "The range of recent disasters worldwide has led to change in disaster policies, raising the need to improve nurses' competencies in disaster response (Loke and Fung, 2014, Yamamoto, 2013). For example, the 9/11 terrorist attack in the U.S. triggered discussions on roles and situations for coping with mass disasters, and there has been recognition of the need to educate and train health care workers, including nurses, in preparation against mass attacks (Gebbie and Qureshi, 2002, Williams et al., 2008, Wisniewski et al., 2004). When a disaster occurs, nurses should be able to assess and meet patients' care needs and to utilize available resources in collaboration with other professionals. Accordingly, they should be equipped with knowledge and abilities to keep themselves safe from disasters, and they need to develop disaster nursing core competencies to carry out nursing activities during and after a disaster (Gebbie & Qureshi, 2002). With this urge to develop a set of core competencies for disaster nursing, the International Council of Nursing (ICN) launched a framework of disaster nursing competencies in 2009 World Health Organization and International Council of Nurses (WHO & ICN, 2009). The framework consists of four areas corresponding to the four stages of a disaster (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery states) and a total of 130 items by which nurses play numerous and multiple vital roles in disaster care and management (WHO & ICN, 2009).",

Moreover, belief that they are thoroughly prepared for disaster situations has been found to increases nurses' confidence in disaster response (Chapman & Arbon, 2008). To acquire disaster core competencies, nurses need knowledge and skills related to disasters and an attitude of disaster preparedness (Fatma, 2014). According to previous studies (Ahn and Kim, 2013, Baack and Alfred, 2013), nurses' disaster core competencies are significantly correlated with disaster-related experience, and knowledge.",

This suggests that education and training in disaster nursing remain insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to identify the factors that influence disaster nursing core competencies so that effective nurses' education and training programs about disaster may be developed and provided in more efficient ways to prepare nurses for disaster. In particular, as the ED is the first place where patients are admitted, examined, and treated in a disaster, factors affecting the core competencies of emergency nurses providing nursing services to such patients using their professional expertise to reduce the risk posed to life and health in this context may be informative (Hammond et al., 2011, Whetzel et al., 2013). Therefore, this study aimed to enhance understanding of emergency nurses' disaster core competencies.",

The contents of this dichotomous scale were verified by a nursing college professor, a professor in emergency medicine, and an emergency nurse practitioner with over 10 years' ED experience. The CVI was assessed by three experts; two items that scored 1 or 2 points in this assessment were revised, and the CVI of the final assessment was 0.85. One point was assigned for a correct answer, and 0 for an incorrect answer or an answer of \u201cdon't know.\u201d The total score ranged from 0 to 10 and was converted to a percentage correct (%). A high score indicates a high level of disaster-related knowledge. The KR 20 coefficient of the 10-item scale was 0.684 in a preliminary survey among 12 emergency nurses, and 0.765 in this study.",

In this study, the participants' mean score was 3.05 out of 5 on the measure of these competencies. In a previous study of Park and Lee (2015) that used the same tool, the reported mean was 3.45. This may be due to the timing of Park and Lee's study (2015), as they collected data at a hospital just after the tragic sinking of the Sewol Ferry in Korea. At that time, the Center for Disaster Relief Training and Research was opened in Korea, and began to conduct workshops on local hospitals' preparation for disasters, as well as simulation education on disaster medicine and procedures. Thus, the level of disaster nursing core competencies may have been temporarily increased at the time of the Park and Lee's study (2015). The present results suggest, however, that nurses need continuous education and training to maintain these competencies. No standardized tool exists by which to measure emergency nurses' core disaster-related competencies. Thus, the present research utilized tools developed within other Korean study. This highlights the need to develop such standardized tools in future research.",

This suggests that disaster nursing core competencies are not enhanced proportionally to work experience or position; rather, disaster-related experience and education are essential for disaster nursing core competencies. A number of academic societies have been established and nursing care provision systems developed for post-disaster response around the globe, especially as natural and man-made disasters have increased in recent times (Yamamoto, 2013). This has also encouraged the development of disaster nursing educational programs and curricula in public health (Loke & Fung, 2014). Nevertheless, recent studies (Baack and Alfred, 2013, Loke and Fung, 2014, Whetzel et al., 2013, Yan et al., 2015) have still reported inadequate disaster nursing competencies and insufficient disaster nursing training. With only two institutions specialized in disaster management education, Korea is relatively poor in terms of resources for training disaster nursing specialists. Accordingly, because most nurses may lack disaster-related experience, regular education and training on disasters is essential for them to accumulate such experience and to gain insight into the reality of disaster response.",

Since the ICN launched its Framework of Disaster Nursing Competencies in 2009, nurses' competencies in this area have been highlighted regarding disaster preparedness. For instance, a previous study (Baack & Alfred, 2013) on the preparedness and perceived competence in managing disasters comprising 620 nurses in Texas found that most nurses was not confident in their ability to respond to disasters. Korea has recently experienced a number of disasters, including not only the tragic sinking of the Sewol Ferry (a man-made disaster) but also natural disasters, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome that threatens the state and the people. Medical institutions play core roles in responding to casualties in the event of a disaster. Education and training regarding disasters helps nurses make practical estimations of how a disaster situation is progressing. It also provides them with opportunities to prepare for similar situations in the future (Hammond et al., 2011, Whetzel et al., 2013). Disaster nursing core competencies are essential for emergency nurses, who have to provide urgent nursing services to a large number of patients in the event of a disaster. However, although a range of disaster-related studies have been conducted among nurses, very little research exists regarding emergency nurses' disaster-related competencies. The findings of this study provide useful basic information showing the necessity of regular disaster-related education and training programs for emergency nurses so that they can cope with disaster situations effectively and carry out their roles confidently.",
