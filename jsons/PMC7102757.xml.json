In addition to the relative level of inexperience and work setting, conventional direct laryngoscopy is regarded as the most difficult procedure for EMS practitioners with insufficient training to perform. Inadequate training and poor equipment not only lead to malpositioning of the placed endotracheal tube but unnecessary trauma.1 The major obstacle of direct laryngoscopy is failure to visualize the larynx because of anatomical variation and/or manipulation errors.2, 3 In contrast, illumination on the tip of the tracheal tube with a lighted stylet (e.g., Lightwand) demonstrates a high rate of successful intubation (97.9\u2013100%).4, 5 However, poor illumination in association with obesity, skin pigmentation, and resistance to the advancement of the endotracheal tube all lead to intubation failure. Accordingly, a video-guided intubation system with a lighted stylet could facilitate endotracheal intubation and avoid many of the mishaps of \u201cblind\u201d intubation.6\n",

The other group consisted of six nonprofessional practitioners, specifically emergency medical technicians (EMT) who lacked endotracheal intubation training and could only perform noninvasive airway establishment such as placing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways and laryngeal mask airways (LMA).

Because the anatomic structure of a mannequin is fixed, there are some differences between the model and a real human body. Furthermore, repeated practice on a mannequin will certainly improve the success rate of intubation as familiarity with its structure increases, but not necessarily when performed on a real human. Based on the above considerations, this test was performed as follows: each participant performed the intubation procedure three times on a mannequin (for 5 minutes) after the airway anatomy tutorials and operational training sessions had been provided, and each time was recorded. The time expenditure on first trial was considered the first successful intubation and procedure record, and the other trials were considered improvement records. Based on the training backgrounds of the participants, only the professional practitioners had ever performed a laryngoscopy before, and the others had only inserted oral, nasal, or laryngeal mask airways.",

Appropriately curve the visual tube and endotracheal tube to an angle of 90\u2013120\u00b0.

Rotate the endotracheal tube 90\u00b0 perpendicular to the visual tube towards the vocal cords.Step 5. Once the vocal cords are visualized, advance slightly and point the visual tube toward the tip of the trachea.Step 6. Using the left hand to fix the tracheal tube and the right hand to hold the console, disconnect the tracheal tube from the visual tube.Step 7. Advance the endotracheal tube down into the trachea to an adequate depth.Step 8. Pull out the visual tube and connect the bag valve to the tracheal tube.

The second part, vocal cord exposure (steps 3\u20135), requires the interruption of CPR in order to start endotracheal intubation.

The major reason for this difference is that when the endotracheal tube is placed into patient's airway, the participant has to use his left hand to fix the endotracheal tube and his right hand to pull the Sunscope out. Although the front end of the visual tube is composed of a soft complex compound, it still needs to be pulled out with an appropriate force, some inappropriate bent angle on visual tube would increase the resistance between the visual tube and endotracheal tube.",

Odds ratio of the survival rate for the two groups was 2.31 (ETT/LMA). The statistical number determined by the Chi-square test was \u03c72 = 5.00, p < 0.05.

When facing an anticipated or unexpected difficult airway, the employment of Sunscope should still follow the current difficult airway-management algorithm.15 In addition, the real human oral cavity is filled with saliva, copious secretion, translucent tissues, and water vapors, and may be obstructed by dropped the tongue or relaxed mandible.
