Since 1883, the synthesis of antipyrine (1) by Knorr, numerous attention has caused by the analgesic and antipyretic activities of pyrazolone analogues [1]. The discovery of these features encouraged the researches to synthesize other pyrazolone derivatives with similar behavior but with a better therapeutic action. Nowadays, multiple FDA approved drugs containing pyrazolone nucleus have been explored (Fig. 2\n), for instances, edaravone (2) has been used as free radical scavenger for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [2], aminophenazone (3) with antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activities has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function evaluations [3], eltrombopag (4) has been used for the treatment of low blood platelet counts in adults with idiopathic chronic immune thrombocytopenia [4], dichloralphenazone (5) has been used for the relief of tension and vascular headaches [5], metamizole (6) has been used for perioperative pain, cancer pain, acute injury and other forms of pain and is considered as the strongest antipyretic [6]. Several investigational small molecules containing pyrazolone have been regarded as drug candidates including sulfamazone (7) [7], propyphenazone (8) [8] and nifenazone (9) [9].",

As for the pharmacology investigators, this review is a concise and critical account focusing on the properties of pyrazolones as antimicrobial, antitumor, CNS effect, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tubercular, antiviral, lipid-lowering, antihyperglycemic agents and protein inhibitors. We summarized advances of pyrazolone derivatives as well as their SAR (10\u2013189). Currently, the existing reviews [10,11] about pyrazolone derivatives are mainly concerning their catalytic asymmetric synthesis or coordination, the comprehensive review of the bioactivity and the SAR studies are still vacant. This review is in order to fill gaps of systematic summarization of biological activities and SAR that could be beneficial for researchers to design novel pyrazolone derivatives, in addition, docking analysis is used to explain interactions between some typical pyrazolone derivatives and potential targets to give a visual appreciation of the roles of pyrazolone group play in the bioactivity.",

Condensation of hydrazines with \u03b2-ketoester compounds is the classical method for the synthesis of pyrazolones (Scheme 1\n), the catalytic conditions are usually the use of organic base like piperidine or inorganic base like NaH in the system of the boiling ethanol or methanol solvent. The nucleus of pyrazolones has been widely used to ulteriorly synthesize broad range of derivatives including spiroheterocycles and acylation productions [13], which features multiple reactive sites. The electrophilic substitution at the C-4 position of pyrazolones is an effective synthetic route for the construction of pyrazolones linked with chiral groups and 4-disubstituted pyrazolones. In addition, as an important synthon, \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated pyrazolones (R1: C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC-R`/CN-R`/CO) can be transformed into diverse pyrazolones.

Metals are able to affect bacterial growth, vitality, and survival [36], and effectively removing metals using metal chelators makes bacterial cells more susceptible to a variety of antibacterial agents, causing cell lysis and loss of viability. Chelators, including EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and metal complexes of chalcone and flavonoids [37,38], have attracting attentions in this field. Recently, many research groups made unremitting efforts to the synthesis and characterization of transition metal chelates of pyrazolones. Pyrazolones were likely to form several types of coordination compounds due to the several electron-rich donor centers [39]. Coordination compounds containing pyrazolone-based ligands are reported to be superior reagents in antimicrobial agents. In 2011, a research about Mn(III) mixed-ligand complexes with bis-pyrazolones and ciprofloxacin drug was published [40], the antimicrobial outcome showed that when added into the strains of microorganisms (E. coli, Serratia marcescens, S. aureus and B. subtilis), the mixed-ligand complexes which contain the moiety of bis-pyrazolones and ciprofloxacin exhibited stronger inhibitory effect compared with bis-pyrazolones, in which compounds 53 and 54 (Fig. 5\n) were the potential active antimicrobial agents. SAR can be suspected as that the chelation decreased the polarity of the central atom due to partial sharing of its positive charge with the donor moieties and possible electron delocalization over the whole chelation ring. The complex molecule promoted the hydrophobic character of the metal chelate and the liposolubility, hence favoring its permeation through the lipoid layer of the cell membrane of microorganism.",

In 2012, according to the theory of Structure-Based Drug Design, Norman and co-workers [52] designed and synthesized a series of class II c-Met inhibitors, among which derivative 67 (Fig. 6) was confirmed to possess excellent potency against c-Met (Ki: 1.0 nM). This privilege compound was demonstrated to show binding affinity not only with c-Met (PDB ID: 3U6H) (Fig. 7\nA), but also with VEGFR-2 kinase (PDB ID: 3U6J) (Fig. 7B) with the help of X-ray analysis of cocrystals. Obviously, the pyrazolone moiety plays crucial roles in occupying active sites of binding pocket, forming the pi-alkyl with Val 1155 in c-Met and H-bond with Asp 1046 in VEGFR-2 kinase, suggesting the broad prospect of pyrazolones developing as antitumor agents in the future. This study provides a new strategy for designing more selective analogues. Therefore, Liu et al. [53] synthesized a cluster of pyrazolone-based analogues according to compound 67 and screened the most selective class II c-Met inhibitor. Among them, compound 68 (Fig. 6) was the representative active antitumor agent. SAR investigation revealed that the 6-methoxy group of quinoline in the region (A), the pyridine in the central ring (B) and 2-hydroxypropyl side chain at N-1 could promote the selectivity and activity. In addition, the polar functionality at C-5 position of the pyrazolone was important for selectivity.",

Among these products, compounds 70 and 71 (Fig. 6) showed the inhibitory activities against SIRT1 with IC50 values of 41 \u03bcM and 27 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, compound 70 displayed the most promising inhibitory effect against SIRT3 (IC50: 6 \u03bcM). According to the pharmacophore investigations, SAR can be sum up as the presence of pyrazolone ring was important to improve the inhibitory effect on SIRT1 and SIRT3 through maintaining the balance of H-bond donor and acceptor moieties, from the active analogue 71, the introduction of bulky hydrophobic benzene group at the C-6 position of naphthalene was helpful to increase the activity on SIRT3.

Pyrazolone derivatives were chronicled to show activity on this target as well [82], the most promising compound 114 (Fig. 9) inhibited GSK-3 with IC50 value of 34 nM. Further investigation demonstrated that this compound possessed good kinase selectivity, and protective effects in oxidative stress mode in neuronal cell and locomotor hyperactivity in C57BL/6J mice were observed. SAR investigation indicated that non-substitution on the A ring was advantageous for the activity because only compound 114 exhibited the pronounced inhibitory effect among the synthetic compounds. Interestingly, the known GSK-3 inhibitors i.e. bisindol-maleimides (115) [83] and hymenialdisine (116) [84] (Fig. 9) contain the moieties structurally similar to the pyrazolone scaffold, which indicated the reasonability of using pyrazolone for the design of the GSK-3 inhibitor.",

The structural similarity between pyrazolone and COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib also provides possibility to develop them into potential clinical candidates [[88], [89], [90], [91]]. The gastrointestinal side effects existing in the usage of COX-1 inhibitors and the cardiovascular side effects in COX-2 inhibitors suggest researchers to consider the inhibitory potency of anti-inflammatory agents on both COX-1 and COX-2, the story of the development of imrecoxib and the conception of moderate selectivity for COX-2 enzyme have been reported as references [19]. It can be seen from the binding affinity models of celecoxib and pyrazolone derivative 131 with COX-1 and COX-2 (Fig. 12) that pyrazolone group maintain the similar pi-alkyl effect with electron group of alkyl groups in the pocket residues compared to pyrrazole ring because of its property similar to aromatic ring. The carbonyl group in pyrrazole is a favorable hydrogen acceptor which is feasible to form potential H-bond with alkaline amino acids like arginine, lysine and histidine, meanwhile, the amino group is a hydrogen donor easy to form hydrogen bond with residues like glutamine (Fig. 12\nD).",

In particular, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has seriously endangered people\u2019s life and health [121]. However, due to the complex pathogenesis [122], it is often neglected in clinical practice. Pyrazolinone derivatives can reduce cholesterol and lipid accumulation in the body by regulating multiple indicators, such as AMPK and FXR. Therefore, it is of importance to improve the lipid-lowering activity by modifying the structure of pyrazolone. The pyrazolone derivatives are also reported to be the selective antagonists to the nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) [123], which maintains the bile acid homeostasis and plays crucial roles in the control of cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism [124,125]. Based on the screen of the known FXR modulators, the lead compound 169 (Fig. 17\n) (IC50: 69.01 \u03bcM) was identified with the help of homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. On the basis of 169, further modification was carried out accordingly. The most promising compound 170 (IC50: 8.96 \u03bcM) displayed antagonistic capability 10-fold and 8-fold higher than that of the control Z-guggulsterone and the original analogue 169, respectively. Compound 170 was further proved to interact with FXR\u03b1LBD with high binding affinity, and potent antagonistic activity against FXR in two cell testing platforms. In addition, compound 170 strongly inhibited the regulating activities of chenodeoxycholic acid on FXR target genes. Furthermore, compound 170 was proved to play a role in lowering the contents of triglyceride and cholesterol in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and in the cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mice. SAR can be interpreted that changes of substituents on the 1, 3, and 4-positions of pyrazolone group had crucial influence on antagonistic effect, and appropriate structural optimizations on the above regions can substantially strengthen activity.",

Pyrazolones have been disclosed to be antihyperglycemic through multiple targets including aldose reductase (AR), \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase. The antihyperglycemic activity of pyrazolone derivatives was explored by Kees et al. [130] The potent compound 173 (100 mg/kg) (Fig. 18\n) caused a 68% decrease in plasma glucose in db/db mice, moreover, it essentially normalized the level of glucose at 20 mg/kg (57% reduction) and maintained remarkable reduction at 2 mg/kg (30% decrease). SAR could be concluded that the substitution of 4-methylthio, methylsulfinyl, or ethyl to a benzyl group at C-4, in combination with trifluoromethyl at C-4 position of pyrazolone (hydroxy tautomer) formed potent antihyperglycemic agents in mice. In addition, the chemical \u201ctrapping\u201d of four of the seven possible tautomeric forms of the heterocycle by mono- and dialkylation at the acidic hydrogens gave several additional potent analogues.",

In regard to SAR, it was possible to note that the hydrophobic groups like benzene ring with pyrazolone adversely influenced AR inhibition, while the introduction of carbothioamide group increased inhibitory effect. Because of the simultaneous existing of arbothioamide moiety and 3-(4I-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole and 3-(4I-chlorophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole substituent group at first position of pyrazolone, compound 174 exerted the best activity. Docking analysis suggested that substituted groups of 174 gave the proper placement of hydrophobic groups in respective binding pockets of AR, avoiding the poor interactions because the size of substitutions was too small to occupy the binding pocket, and the pyrazolone moiety in compound 174 was considered to play a role in form H-bond with the residue Cys 298.",

In addition, significant bronchodilatory activity was observed. SAR study demonstrated that the presence of pyrazolopyridine 7-substituent can engender potency for the inhibition of PDE 4, and the isosteric imidazopyridine substitution made for the pyrazolopyridine subunit increases the well-balanced dual of PDE 3 and PDE 4. As a member of PDEs, Trypanosoma brucei PDB1 (TbrPDEB1) was described as a crucial target for the therapy of Human African trypanosomiasis [134,135], which was a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan pathogen T. brucei. Orrling and colleagues [136] explored catechol pyrazolinones as trypanocidals inspired from the structural motif rolipram. After the scaffold merging, the premier potent compound 180 (Fig. 19) was selected with the TbrPDEB1 IC50 value of 12 \u03bcM. Furthermore, with the help of homology modeling and docking studies to guide fragment growing into the parasite-specific P-pocket, which was a unique sub-pocket that extended from the invariant glutamine (Gln 874) through the protein to the solvent in the enzyme binding site, the fragment growing compound 181 (Fig. 19) was emerged with the outstanding activities for inhibiting T. brucei rhodesiense with IC50 value of 60 nM and TbrPDEB1 with IC50 value of 49 nM. SAR investigation elucidated that pyrazolone held a conjugated \u03c0-system and additional possibility to interact with aromatic residues in the binding pocket of TbrPDEB1. Moreover, the extended alkyl chain in the analogues of 181 enabled to reach and enter the P-pocket, which displaced water from the length of the P-pocket and placed the tetrazole at the solvent-exposed exit of the pore. The tetrazole in compound 181 formed a H-bond with Tyr 845, further stabilizing the conformation. Afterwards, according to the structure of 180 and 181, Amata and co-workers [137] designed and synthesized a cluster of derivatives, while poor inhibitory effect was detected, the most promising pyrazolone compound 182 (Fig. 19) only showed inhibition for 18% at the dose of 10 \u03bcM, indicating a better understanding of the subtle structural features was necessary for an optimal enzyme inhibition.",

The A ring was the area the authors paid attention to modify, and they found that when A ring was substituted as pyridine ring could elevate the activity because it contained a basic nitrogen in the 2-position to occupy the hydrophobic pocket.

According to the concept of generalized bioisosteres [142,143], as a typical synthetic rather than natural motif in medicinal chemistry, pyrazolone is potential to replace multiple moieties with similar chemical structure and bioactivities including parazole, imidazolin-5-one and 2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one, etc., providing an important scaffold for drug development. Being a versatile molecule with immense biological significance, pyrazolone derivatives are being developed for several pathological screening including antimicrobial, antitumor, CNS effect, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitubercular, antiviral and protein inhibitors activities since long.",

With the development of science, machine learning, virtual screening and combinatorial chemistry technologies shorten the time of filtrating the leading compounds and will play a more and more important role in drug design in the future [144,145]. Investigations for privileged scaffold from the perspective of SAR have been lasting several years [[146], [147], [148], [149], [150], [151]]. It is probable that pyrazolone scaffold has its position in the establishment of compound library due to its good drug-likeness and broad bioactive properties. Moreover, as we mentioned in this article, the pyrazolone group maintains properties like aromatic and it is feasible to form pi-alkyl effect with residues in the potential target, and the carbonyl group in pyrrazole is a favorable hydrogen acceptor which is feasible to form potential H-bond, which provide evidence for the importance of pyrazolone structural motif in medicinal chemistry.",
