Deleting LAT coding sequences or LAT promoter sequences reduce the efficiency of reactivation in latently infected rabbits and mice [1\u20133]. This complex locus expresses multiple transcripts, six micro-RNAs, and two small non-coding RNAs [6\u20138]. LAT protects neurons from cell death, partly by inhibiting apoptosis and viral gene expression [9\u201313]. The anti-apoptosis functions of LAT are dependent on an active serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) [14, 15]. LAT also interferes with granzyme B mediated apoptosis [16] and increases CD8+ T cell exhaustion during latency [17]. The anti-apoptosis functions of LAT are important in the context of the latency-reactivation cycle because inserting anti-apoptosis genes into the LAT locus of a LAT-/- mutant virus restores reactivation to WT like levels [18\u201321]. As LAT is generally considered to express non-coding RNAs, LAT may also influence expression of cellular factors that promote the establishment and maintenance of latency.",

            "text": "Cellular genes associated with the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway are differentially expressed during the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) latency-reactivation cycle [22\u201324]. For example, during latency signficantly more TG neurons express \u03b2-catenin relative to TG from uninfected calves or during reactivation from latency. When BoHV-1 reactivation from latency is induced by the synthetic corticostroid dexamethasone, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is turned off, in part because expression of several soluble Wnt antagonists are stimulated [37, 38]. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is comprised of 19 related Wnt receptors, 7 Wnt co-receptors, many downstream effectors of this pathway, and two distinct families of Wnt antagonists [37, 38]. In the absence of the Wnt ligand or in the presence of a Wnt antagonist, a multi-protein \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, which includes Axin, APC (adenomatous polyposis gene), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2), and casein kinase alpha (CKI\u03b1), hyper-phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin. This leads to poly-ubiquitination of \u03b2-catenin and degradation via the proteasome. Binding of Wnt to one of its receptor/co-receptor complexes disrupts the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, the transcription factor \u03b2-catenin levels increase, \u03b2-catenin enters the nucleus, and interacts with TCF (T cell factor) family members bound to DNA. \u03b2-catenin binding to a TCF family member displaces transcriptional co-repressors and recruits co-activators to activate Wnt target genes. This signaling pathway promotes neuronal development and maturation, axonal growth and targeting, and neuronal survival [25\u201330], functions crucial for maintaining latency. Since BoHV-1 is a neurotropic \u03b1-herpesvirinae subfamily member, it is reasonable to suggest the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway may also regulate certain aspects of the latency-reactivation in additional neurotropic herpesviruses.",

The mouse studies were approved and the animal use protocol is VM15-26. Female, 6\u20138 week-old Swiss-Webster mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were acclimated to standard laboratory conditions (12 hrs. light/dark cycles, 5 animals/cage) for 1 week prior to ocular infections. For infections, mice were anesthetized via standard isoflurane/oxygen vaporization and infected with ~2x105 PFU wt HSV-1 (n = 50) or the LAT-/- mutant (dLAT2903, n = 50) in 2\u03bcL MEM per eye without scarification as described previously [31]. Ocular infections can result in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) of approximately 50% of animals during the first 15 days after infection. Consequently, mice were monitored twice daily for the duration of the experiments and, if any HSE-related symptoms such tremors, swollen forehead, or weight loss were observed, animals were promptly and humanely euthanized via isoflurane overdose and subsequent cervical dislocation. Infected mice were not allowed to reach HSE-induced death as an endpoint. A subset of surviving animals commonly displayed symptoms of acute ocular herpes infections such as redness, discharge, and fur-loss at the site of inoculation and were therefore treated twice daily with Neomycin/polymyxin B/Bacitracin zinc triple antibiotic ophthalmic ointment (Bausch + Lomb, Tampa, FL) to prevent secondary bacterial infection and minimize pain and distress. Mice infected for at least 30 days were operationally defined as being latently infected.",

            "text": "The Wnt signaling pathway enhances HSV-1 productive infection in cultured cells [32] and Wnt-associated genes are differentially expressed during the BoHV-1 latency-reactivation cycle [23]. Specifically, the transcription factor \u03b2-catenin is expressed in more TG neurons of latently infected calves when compared to TG neurons of uninfected calves or calves treated with DEX to induce viral reactivation [22\u201324]. In humans, the Wnt pathway has 19 genes encoding ligands and 15 receptor- or coreceptor-encoding genes [33]. It is not known which ligand activates each receptor; nor is it known which Wnt ligands or receptors are expressed in TG neurons. When a Wnt ligand engages its receptor, \u03b2-catenin protein levels generally increase, which was the rational for examining \u03b2-catenin as a marker for active canonical Wnt signaling. For these studies, we examined the effect of a LAT-/- mutant (dLAT2903) relative to wild-type (wt) HSV-1. LAT is the only viral gene product abundantly expressed in latently infected neurons and thus was an important comparison to wt LAT+/+ HSV-1 [34]. The dLAT2903 mutant virus used for this study contains a deletion from -161 to +1667 relative to the start of the primary 8.3-kb LAT: consequently, dLAT2903 does not express detectable levels of LAT, and reactivation from latency in rabbits and mice is significantly reduced [34\u201337]. The LAT-/- mutant (dLAT2903) was marker repaired back to wt (dLAT2903R) and has identical properties as the parental wt McKrae strain of HSV-1 [34, 35]: therefore, dLAT2903R is referred to as wt HSV-1 throughout this study.",

For example, ocular infection of C57Bl/6 mice (no corneal scarification) with LAT+/+ McKrae establishes latency 3\u20134 times more efficiently relative to dLAT2903, as judged by viral DNA in TG [17]. Male Swiss Webster mice infected via ocular infection after corneal scarification with LAT+/+ 17syn+ HSV-1 virus strain (17-AHR1) establishes latency approximately 4 times more efficiently compared to a LAT deletion mutant that lacked 1,964 bp encompassing the LAT promoter and first 828 bp of the 5\u2019 end of LAT (17-AH) in [13]. Female Swiss Webster mice infected via the ocular cavity (no corneal scarification) with wt McKrae established latency approximately 2 times more efficiently than dLAT2903 (data not shown). In summary, the inability of dLAT2903 to establish latency as efficiently as wt McKrae (dLAT2903R) influenced the % of \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons during latency: however, LAT expression clearly correlated with high levels of \u03b2-catenin expression in TG neurons during latency.",

TG explants were incubated with MEM + 2% charcoal-stripped FBS in the presence or absence of DEX. FBS passed through a column containing \u201cactivated\u201d charcoal removes hormones, lipid-based molecules, certain growth factors, and cytokines yielding stripped FBS. However, this process does not remove salts, glucose, and most amino acids. FBS contains bio-active corticosteroids because nearly all Neuro-2A cells incubated with MEM + 10% FBS [38] contain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the nucleus. Conversely, nearly all Neuro-2A cells contain GR in the cytoplasm when incubated with 2% stripped FBS [38]. Furthermore, corticosterone levels were significantly higher in FBS compared to stripped FBS [31]. Recent studies demonstrated explant-induced reactivation from latency is stimulated by the synthetic corticosteroid DEX and expression of viral regulatory proteins were expressed earlier when TG explants were incubated with DEX [31]. At 4 or 8 hours after TG explant without DEX, \u03b2-catenin+ neurons were readily detected in mice latently infected with wt HSV-1 (Fig 3; panels denoted WT 4 or WT 8).

TG from mice latently infected with wt HSV-1 contained similar levels of \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons at 4 and 8 hours after TG explant (approximately 60% were \u03b2-catenin+; Fig 6A). When DEX was added to TG explants from mice latently infected with wt HSV-1, significantly fewer TG neurons were \u03b2-catenin+. At 4 hours post-explant (no DEX treatment), TG from mice latently infected with dLAT2903 contained significantly more \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons relative to latency (Fig 6B). Interestingly, mice latently infected with dLAT2903 had approximately 60% \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons when explants were treated with DEX for 4 hours, which was similar to TG from mice latently infected with wt HSV-1. At 8 hours post-explant, \u03b2-catenin expression decreased to levels similar to mice latently infected with dLAT2903 (~10%, Fig 6B); however, DEX treatment increased \u03b2-catenin expression 3-fold. Overall, TG from uninfected mice was more similar to TG from mice latently infected with dLAT2903 than wt HSV-1 (Fig 6C). While the intensity of \u03b2-catenin expression in uninfected mice (Fig 5) was clearly less than latently infected TG (Figs 3 and 4), approximately 80% of TG neurons were \u03b2-catenin+ at 4 hours after explant when incubated in MEM containing DEX (Fig 6C; 4 + DEX). At 8 hours after explant in the presence of DEX, the number of \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons was reduced to approximately 60%. In summary, these studies indicated explant-induced reactivation in the presence of DEX dramatically altered \u03b2-catenin expression in TG neurons. While these studies suggested LAT expression influenced \u03b2-catenin expression during explant-induced reactivation, published reports concluded RNA encoding ICP0, ICP4, and/or thymidine kinase can be detected in TG of mice latently infected with HSV-1 [41, 42]. If these lytic cycle proteins are expressed, they may have differential impacts on \u03b2-catenin expression, depending on whether LAT is expressed.",

To examine the effect the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway had on explant-induced reactivation from latency, two different Wnt-pathway antagonists were used: iCRT14 and KYA1797K. iCRT14 is a thiazolidinedione inhibitor that impairs \u03b2-catenin binding with a T-cell factor (TCF) family member and subsequent TCF binding to DNA: consequently, \u03b2-catenin dependent transcription is not induced [43]. KYA1797K enhances formation of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex through binding of Axin, which stimulates GSK3\u03b2 activation [44]. For each antagonist, cytotoxicity studies using both Vero cells and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a, ATCC CCL131) were performed, showing no effect with concentrations up to 50\u03bcM [32] and data not shown.",

It is assumed LAT does not encode a functional protein that regulates the latency-reactivation cycle [3]. Hence, the dogmatic belief is small non-coding RNAs mediate key events during the latency-reactivation cycle, including micro-RNAs located within the LAT locus [6, 7]. Certain LAT encoded miRNAs interfere with expression of viral transcripts that encode key regulatory proteins. For example, miR-H3 [6] interferes with expression of the key viral transcriptional regulator ICP4. ICP34.5, an important lytic neurovirulence factor, is targeted by two viral miRNAs, miR-H3 and miR-H4 [6]. A mutant virus that does not express the LAT-encoded miR-H2 has increased neurovirulence and reactivation [45], in part because this miRNA interferes with ICP0 expression [6, 46]. Two small non-coding RNAs, which are not micro-RNAs, are expressed in TG of mice latently infected with wt HSV-1; interestingly, sequences encoding these small non-coding RNAs are deleted from dLAT2903 [8]. These LAT small non-coding RNA interfere with apoptosis and ICP4 expression [47] suggesting they also play a role in the latency-reactivation cycle. Analysis of the known miRNAs encoded by the human herpesviruses are reported to preferentially target the Wnt signaling pathway [48], which supports the premise that stabilizing \u03b2-catenin expression in TG neurons during latency is important for maintaining a life-long latent infection in sensory neurons.",

A previous report concluded that approximately 30% of TG neurons in mice were latently infected with a virulent HSV-1 strain [49] suggesting a subset of \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons were not infected. LAT miRNAs (miR-H3, miR-H5, and mIR-H6) are present in exosomes that are transported from productively infected cells to uninfected cells [50]. Hence, it is tempting to suggest exosomes containing LAT gene products are transported to surrounding uninfected TG neurons or non-neuronal support cells: consequently, \u03b2-catenin expression is activated in \u201cbystander\u201d cells, including neurons. However, it should be pointed out there is no current published study showing exosomes frequently transport LAT non-coding RNAs to uninfected TG neurons during latency. Extracellular factors regulate (positively as well as negatively) the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway [33, 51] suggesting mice latently infected with wt HSV-1 produce a soluble factor that stimulates \u03b2-catenin expression or increases its \u00bd life in bystander cells. Strikingly, Wnt16, a soluble Wnt agonist, is expressed at 54 times higher levels in TG of calves latently infected with BoHV-1 when compared to TG from calves treated with DEX for 30 minutes to initiate reactivation from latency [23]. Regardless of how the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is activated in TG of mice latently infected with wt HSV-1, activation of this signaling pathway would promote neuronal survival and neurogenesis [26, 39, 52, 53], including TG neurons that do not contain viral genomes.",

            "text": "In general, increased corticosteroids, due to stress and depression, interfere with \u03b2-catenin in the nervous system [54]. Furthermore, stress induces expression of soluble Wnt antagonists that interfere with \u03b2-catenin expression, and induces neuronal death [51, 55]. While the findings with wt HSV-1 are in concordance with these findings, it was clear \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with dLAT2903 increased following explant. In particular, the number of \u03b2-catenin+ TG neurons in mice latently infected with dLAT2903 or uninfected mice increased when DEX was added. During explant-induced reactivation, the normal tropic support that TG receive in vivo is disrupted, which may impact how certain signaling pathways are regulated following explant. Additional evidence that explant-induced reactivation does not recapitulate all events during reactivation in vivo comes from a recent study that demonstrates apoptosis is induced in many TG neurons from latently infected mice within 4 hours after explant [31]. In contrast, TG neurons do not frequently undergo apoptosis during early stages of DEX induced reactivation in calves latently infected with BoHV-1 in vivo [56, 57]. It is also unlikely apoptosis occurs frequently in human TG neurons undergoing HSV-1 reactivation. While it seems clear that explant-induced reactivation in the mouse model has limitations, these studies indicated that LAT encoded products, directly or indirectly, influenced \u03b2-catenin expression in TG neurons during latency.",

            "text": "Since \u03b2-catenin was preferentially expressed during latency, it was surprising that inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway consistently reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. However, iCRT14 reduced HSV-1 virus yields in productively infected non-neuronal cells (human fetal lung and Vero cells) and a late protein, VP16, enhanced \u03b2-catenin dependent transcription as well as stabilized \u03b2-catenin steady state protein levels [32]. An independent study revealed infected cells can be divided into transcriptionally unique subsets: furthermore, cells abortively infected were identified where antiviral signaling blunted productive infection [58]. In certain \u201chighly infected cells\u201d transcriptional reprogramming occurred, in part because \u03b2-catenin is recruited to the nucleus and viral replication compartments: hence, \u03b2-catenin promotes late viral gene expression and progeny production [58]. While the potential dual role for \u03b2-catenin during the latency-reactivation cycle may appear to be implausible, it is well established that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway has different effects in a cell-type- and contextual-specific manner. For example, dysregulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is crucial for development of certain types of cancer [59]: conversely, the same pathway mediates neurogenesis and cell survival in the nervous system [28, 29]. Based on these observations, we suggest that during establishment and maintenance of latency following infection with wt virus, \u03b2-catenin expression in TG neurons promotes neuronal survival [53] and neurogenesis [28, 29]. During early phases of reactivation in mice latently infected with wt virus, \u03b2-catenin may be recruited to replication complexes in certain latently infected TG neurons. This could be one of many transcriptional reprogramming events that culminates in stimulating lytic cycle viral gene expression and virus shedding, hallmarks of successful reactivation from latency.",
