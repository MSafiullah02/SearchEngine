The presence of a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) surface glycoprotein in addition to the viral spike protein is a distinguishing characteristic of most group 2a coronaviruses. BCoV is ubiquitous in cattle worldwide and is an economically significant cause of calf diarrhea, winter dysentery of adult cattle, and respiratory disease in calves and feedlot cattle. We have developed and optimized laboratory diagnostic techniques, including virus isolation in HRT-18 cell cultures, antibody and antigen ELISA, and RT-PCR, for rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnosis of BCoV and related wild ruminant coronaviruses.",

Bovine coronavirus causes acute diarrhea in neonatal calves and winter dysentery in adult cattle causing large economic losses owing to diarrheal morbidity and mortality costs and decreased milk production (2, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The enteropathogenic coronaviruses were initially identified and isolated from neonatal calves with severe diarrhea (31). Subsequently, coronaviruses were revealed to be a cause of winter dysentery in adult cattle (2,32-35) as well as respiratory disease (shipping fever pneumonia) (29, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] , and antigenic, biologic, and genetic variation among these strains was demonstrated (28, 37, (41) (42) (43) . Repeated upper respiratory BCoV infections occur frequently in calves, and subclinically infected animals may be reservoirs for BCoV (28, 30 Detailed methods for cell culture propagation of the enteric BCoVs were described by Saif et al. in 1988 (48) . General procedures for the isolation of winter dysentery (49) and respiratory strains of BCoV in HRT-18 cell cultures (using cloned HRT-18 cells from the L. J. Saif laboratory) (37), antibody and antigen ELISA, and RT-PCR have been optimized and standardized in our laboratory (2,28,50,51) and are described in detail in the following sections. For the antigen (Ag) ELISA tests, monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were produced and characterized by our laboratory and standardized for routine use in ELISA, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (41,50-52).

            "text": "In summary, multiple diagnostic tests have been developed and standardized for the routine diagnosis of BCoV and the closely related ruminant Group 2a CoVs. These include antigen or antibody detection by ELISA, virus isolation in cell culture (HRT-18 cells), and, often the most sensitive method, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. These methods have provided evidence for the presence of CoVs closely related genetically or antigenically to BCoV, not only from wild ruminants, but also from dogs (21) and humans (53). These findings and experimental transmission studies (8,44,54) confirm a broad host range for bovine-like group 2a CoVs and support a need to monitor their presence in other host species, including humans, by applying the diagnostic assays outlined in this chapter and the sequencing of new isolates. . (4) was not optimal in RT-PCR with some CoV samples from wild ruminants. Thus, based on the consensus sequence (for all available RdRp sequences of coronaviruses from different groups) in all polymorphic positions, degenerative nucleotides were introduced. After these primers were tested with positive samples (validated in other assays), they demonstrated consistently positive results. 9. The coronavirus nucleoprotein gene was chosen for group-specific primer development because it has been shown to be variable in amino acid and nucleotide composition among the viruses that comprise the three coronavirus antigenic groups, but highly conserved within these groups. 10 The optimal melting temperature for group 2a-specific primers and nested-PCR is 56 \u2022 C; for pancorona-and BCoV-specific primers, the optimal melting temperature is 50 \u2022 C. 11. If RT-PCR sensitivity is low, a nested PCR method can increase PCR product yield. However, this will also increase the risk of cross-contamination. Standard precautions to avoid cross-contamination should be implemented. These include: use of gloves with frequent changing; employing of aerosol resistant pipettors and pipette tips; preparing of PCR master mixes in UV cabinets that should never be used for work with any sample materials or PCR DNA products; regular decontamination of work surfaces and all equipment with 10% chlorine or another commercially available disinfectant; separate working areas for each step of the PCR analysis as well as separate storage areas for PCR reagents and contaminated samples (47).",

(4), targeted to the conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is capable of universal detection of known coronaviruses (see Note 8). Group 2a-specific primers were designed based on the consensus sequence of the nucleoprotein gene for group 2a coronaviruses (see Note 9). The BCoV-specific primers are targeted to the nucleoprotein and can also amplify a specific fragment for BCoV and the related wild-ruminant CoVs, but not other group 2 coronaviruses (28). 2. Reaction conditions are optimized using RT-PCR reagents commercially available from Promega, but they are easily adapted to enable the use of alternative reagents.3. The typical PCR master mix should contain the following reagents in the 0.2-ml PCR tubes (RNAse/DNAse and Pyrogene safe): 10X thermophillic DNA polymerase buffer (2.5 l); magnesium chloride 2.5 mM; 0.2 M dNTPs mix; forward and reverse primers 50 pmol each; AMV reverse transcriptase 2.5 U; RNasin 10 U; Taq DNA polymerase 1.25 U; adjust volume with Milli-Q DEPC-treated water to 23 l. 2-l RNAs extracted from the samples is added to each tube. RNA extracted from mock-inoculated HRT-18 cell culture supernatants or negative fecal or nasal samples and water should be used as negative controls and BCoV-infected HRT-18 cell culture supernatants or BCoV-positive fecal or nasal samples as positive controls. 4.
