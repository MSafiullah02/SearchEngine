            "text": "The NIH Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network (MLSCN) is a subset of the Molecular Libraries Initiative (MLI) component of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research [1,2]. It consists of a consortium of 10 centers, each having expertise in assay development, high-throughput screening (HTS), chemistry and informatics. Using a centralized screening library of approximately 100,000 small molecules and assays from the research community, scientists at each center optimize assays, carry out high-throughput screens, and deposit the results into PubChem (vida infra). Based on the data from those assays, chemists at each center further optimize the initial hits in order to develop unique, small molecule probes of biological systems [3]. Informaticists contribute to data handling and analysis throughout this process. The chemical probes developed are available to researchers (both public and private sectors) via data deposition into PubChem, and in the future, via access to samples and synthetic protocols to prepare the probes. These efforts support the ultimate goals of the MLSCN and the MLI, which is to \u201cexpand the availability, flexibility, and use of small-molecule chemical probes for basic research\u201d[1].",

            "text": "A number of aspects of the MLSCN make this initiative unique from other academic screening centers [4], [5], as well as from screening and lead optimization activities being undertaken at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. First, all researchers (public and private sector) have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms [6]. Second, due to the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (a) \u201chigh risk\u201d targets, that is proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (b) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (c) novel or uncommon assay systems (e.g., zebrafish, high content screening); and (d) \u201cnon-druggable\u201d targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein\u2013protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Sources of these unique structures include natural products and novel compound libraries prepared by academic investigators through the Pilot Scale Libraries (PSL) granting mechanisms [7], compounds generated by the Centers for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development (CMLD) (vida infra) [8] and those obtained through solicitation by the NIH [9]. Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development. Therefore, chemical probes are not subject to the same constraints on physical properties, functional groups or metabolic profiles that are common in the pharmaceutical industry, and necessary for successful clinical candidates. An example of a compound that would fit the definition of a valuable chemical probe, but which would not adhere to the commonly prescribed criteria of \u201cdrug-like\u201d is a staurosporine-derived ruthenium complex, shown below, which is a selective, sub-nanomolar inhibitor of the kinase, Pim1\n[10]. Fifth, and particularly important for this review, is the inclusion of integral medicinal chemistry within each MLSCN Center, that allows the network to produce chemical probes with particular properties, rather than simply identifying apparent activities from the screening collection. Finally, unlike all other screening efforts in both industry and academia, all data are available in PubChem with no delay in publication. In addition to HTS protocols and primary screening results, secondary assay data, \u201cprofiling data\u201d (e.g., aggregation evaluation, Cytochrome P450 inhibition, spectroscopic profiling, solubility measurements), follow-up compound libraries and their associated biological data, and synthetic protocols are accessible. \n",

Using a process called quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS), chemical libraries are screened at multiple concentrations (typically seven) to generate a concentration\u2013response curve for each compound that covers a range of five orders of magnitude (typically 1 nM to 100 \u03bcM). qHTS comprehensively and efficiently characterizes biological activities of large chemical libraries to yield high-quality datasets for chemical probe development and compound profiling [12]. This process has been applied successfully to both cell-free and cell-based assays. The Kalypsys robotic system uses multimodal detectors, the ViewLux and Envision systems, and a plate-based laser cytometry system (Acumen Explorer) for high-capacity screening (100,000+wells/day) in the reagent-sparing 1536-well plate format. Assay detection capabilities include absorbance, luminescence, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET), fluorescence polarization (FP), fluorescence intensity (FI), and AlphaScreen\u2122, as well as cell-based imaging assays that employ fluorescent proteins such as GFP (green fluorescence protein). The NCGC also develops new paradigms for screening, informatics, and chemical probe development that extend the application of small molecule technology to new areas of the genome. Collaborations with academic investigators worldwide, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies produces public domain data, thereby allowing sharing of best practices to enable both chemical genomics and downstream drug development. The NCGC accepts chemical libraries for screening from academic and industrial investigators, and produces its own focused libraries for specific projects that are added to the screening collection. With its miniaturized qHTS process, as little as 0.1\u20130.5 mg of compound will support several years of screening against hundreds of diverse biological assays. The NCGC is part of the intramural NIH program of the National Human Genome Research Institute.",

The FDSS also supports ultra low-light detection for aequorin and other kinetic/flash luminescence formats. Additionally, the Vanderbilt Center supports high-content screening through the use of the BlueShift Isocyte, a laser scanning fluorimeter that generates two-dimensional anisotropy data. This combination of capabilities paired with robust automation provides tremendous flexibility for measuring the action of a test compound on a wide range of targets. The investment in infrastructure, the combination of basic and industrial research expertise, the dedication to translational and chemical biology, and the establishment and maintenance of a highly collaborative environment make the Vanderbilt Center well suited to support the MLSCN.",

This initial hit exhibited only modest potency (IC50=19.2 \u03bcM), however it appeared to display some selectivity against other phosphatases, and excellent selectivity against the 52 other targets tested [25]. A small library of compounds was designed and prepared in an effort to identify compounds with improved potency. Towards that end, several new uracil-based compounds, such as SID 14715524, exhibited improvements in potency. MKP-1 is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in a number of processes related to cell proliferation. The availability of potent, selective and cell permeable probes would help enable a thorough understanding of the role this enzyme plays in cell cycle, signal transduction, oncogenesis, and apoptosis. While small molecule inhibitors of MKP-1 have been previously reported [26], they have been hampered by low in vitro potency, lack of cellular activity, and poor selectivity. As such, these uracil quinolines from the PMLSC represent a novel structural class which, based on their promising physicochemical properties, may provide an improvement over those inhibitors previously reported. \n",

NMR-based screening of a library composed of 300 fragments followed by SAR optimization by interligand NOE led to the identification of two chemical fragments that bind on the surface of BID. Covalent linkage of the two fragments provided high-affinity bidentate derivatives such as BI\u201311A7\n[27,28]. In vitro and cellular assays showed that these compounds prevent tBID translocation to the mitochondrial membrane and the subsequent release of proapoptotic stimuli, and inhibit neuronal apoptosis in the low micromolar range.

PS (EC 6.3.2.1) is encoded by the panC gene and catalyzes the essential adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent condensation of D-pantoate and \u03b2-alanine to form pantothenate in bacteria, yeast, and plants. Pantothenate is a key precursor for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein (ACP). Because the enzyme is absent in mammals, and both CoA and ACP are essential cofactors for bacterial growth, PS is an attractive chemotherapeutic target. An automated high-throughput screen was developed to identify drugs that inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis PS. The activity of PS was measured spectrophotometrically through an enzymatic cascade involving myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of PS ATP utilization was quantitated by the reduction of absorbance due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by lactate dehydrogenase, which allowed for an internal control to detect interference from compounds that absorb at 340 nm. This coupled enzymatic reaction was used to screen 4080 compounds in a 96-well format.

However, it was recently shown that the GPR30 binds estrogen with high affinity and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways. To differentiate between the functions of ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2 and GPR30, the New Mexico MLSC team used a combination of virtual and biomolecular screening to isolate compounds that selectively bind to GPR30.
