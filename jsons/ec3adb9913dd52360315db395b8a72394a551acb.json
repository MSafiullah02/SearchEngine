The clinical trials are underway for Remdesivir, an investigational anti-viral drug from Gilead Sciences. Antimalarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives are being used in emergency cases; however, they are not suitable for patients with conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac issues. The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it. This paper evaluates the compound Andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) through in silico studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction. Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Computational approaches also predicts this molecule to have good solubility, pharmacodynamics property and target accuracy. This molecule also obeys Lipinski's rule, which makes it a promising compound to pursue further biochemical and cell based assays to explore its potential for use against COVID-19.",

Through analyzing the viral sequence and evolutionary analysis, bat was suspected to be the natural host of the virus. And the virus might have been transferred to humans as their intermediate host by binding to ACE-2 Receptor (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 Receptor) (Zhou et al., 2020) . The first lethal case was reported on 11 January 2020. The infection from patients to healthcare workers was first verified on 20 January 2020. It was further reported that during Chinese New Year people migrated from Wuhan to various countries of the world. New cases evolved to other countries especially to various patients with no travel history to China which notified scientific and medical communities that local human to human transmission were seen in those countries (Rothe et al., 2020) . Recently, the total number of cases around the world was recorded to be 1,203,959 confirmed cases with more than 64,788 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Various types of treatments have been proposed which are mainly antiviral drugs, SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov antibodies are being used by clinicians and recent recommended combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was studied and its results of open labelled non randomized clinical trial was published Gautret et al., 2020) .",

And upon certain in vitro and some clinical data chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulphate was advised to be the treatment for COVID-19 and enough randomized trials on these compounds to be provided and allowed the administration of the above drugs to be used for emergency (https://www.fda.gov/emergency-use-authori-zation#covidtherapeutics). Hydroxychloroquine may have inhibitory mechanism over the viral processes and metabolisms. They may be involved in other mechanisms as inhibition of ACE2 cellular receptor, acidification of the cell membrane preventing the entry of virus and modulation of immune response through respective cytokine release (COVID-19 Drug Therapy-Elsevier, 09 March 2020). But recent studies have shown that the hydroxychloroquine can also cause drug poisoning and severe or moderate adverse effects in individuals who are already taking treatments for diabetic and hypersensitive patients, the same patient group who are found to be affected severely by COVID-19. Administration of hydroxychloroquine has found to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines which finally leads to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Guastalegname & Vallone, 2020) . It has been found out that adverse neuropsychiatric condition was seen in post treatment of hydroxychloroquine which is hypothesized that it specifies the lysosomal dysfunction leading to psychiatric symptoms, which initiated the normal state of the patient who has been administered with the drug (Ali & Jones et al., 2018) . Lethal adverse effect of retinal toxicity was seen in patient with acute renal impairment when administered with hydroxychloroquine (Tailor et al., 2012) . A study of high doses of hydroxychloroquine along with atorvastatin in diabetic patients showed highest decline of blood glucose in patients (Wondafrash et al., 2020) . When Antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine when administered to patients with dermatomyosis, non-life threatening cutaneous reactions are seen most in dermatomyosis patients than cutaneous lupus erythrematosus (Pelle & Callen, 2002) and many side effects has been reported. And according to the website, (https://www. guidetopharmacology.org/coronavirus.jsp) many ligands which are synthetic in nature have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and are in clinical trials and are in process of peer review.",

A potential natural, non-synthetic drug compound has to be found with minimal side effects. The drugs which are necessary to act on the targets such as ACE-2 receptors, TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 and CD147 (https://www. guidetopharmacology.org/coronavirus.jsp) are in the process of being found in order to decrease the prognosis of the disease and life cycle of the virus. In silico studies of chemically synthetic drugs such as Paritaprevir and Raltegravir, Doultegravir and Bictegravir for the targets 3CLpro and 2 0 -OMTase (Khan, Jha, et al., 2020) , theophylline and pyrimidone derivatives as possible inhibitors of RNA bound N terminal domain (Sarma et al., 2020) and Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir also with two natural compounds, flavone and coumarine derivatives for the inhibition of 3CL pro (Khan, Zia, et al., 2020) have been published. Though there are many targets are found for the treatment of COVID-19, the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 was chosen due to interest of treating infected patients, to stop the multiplication of virus within the cells, through which M pro was involved in the release of polypeptides which are functional extensive proteolysis and cleavage of the enzyme itself from the sites of genome, pp1a and ppa1ab .",

This is known as the concept of repurposing the natural phytomolecules which will hasten the drug discovery process. During a search for such potent plant compounds we found a recent study on potential plant compounds which are able to inhibit the M pro is in a process of publication (Khaerunnisa et al., 2020) , while discussing the findings on the paper with group of Siddha and Ayurvedic doctors, they have advised us to examine the properties of the traditional available plant, several plant molecules obtained from medicinal plants were explored. The outcome was that Andrographis paniculata which was found to have anti-viral property and already reported in ancient texts could be investigated as a good bet. We examined the main compound in Andrographis paniculata and found that the main compound in the plant was Andrographolide. The plant compound has been evidenced to have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity and anti-diabetes (Dai et al., 2019) . Andrographolide was found to have antiviral properties over many types of viral infections (Gupta et al., 2017) and was found to have activity against Chikungunya (Wintachai et al., 2015) potential inhibitor of herpes simplex virus type-1 (Seubsasana et al., 2011) . Also, during the outbreak of dengue in India at 2006, aqueous extracts of Andgrographis paniculata were given through the advice of Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) department of India which led to decrease in cases and infection of the disease as a preventive measure even to normal people acting as a immune booster. The study of anti-dengue activity was found and published through quantification of dengue viral inhibition and showed most antiviral inhibitory effects when DENV 1-4 infected Vero cells with maximum nontoxic dose (Krishnasamy et al., 2018) . Due to these antiviral activities the compound Andrographolide was chosen.",

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin complex is being advised to be given for the affected in case of emergency, though it has been studied to increase the pH of the protease and is published as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread Heald-Sargent & Gallagher, 2012; Vincent et al., 2005) . The Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin complex mentioned above may be potent, but the adverse side effects they bring to the patients are very alarming as shared already, with these drastic side effects, the need to bring equally or more potent alternatives in the form of plant derived drug is very essential as they are much safe and have no known side effects. As we are interested only in finding pure potent plant compounds without adding any analogs or derivatives we found that the plant compound, Andrographolide intriguing due to its awesome properties. The drug compound, Andrographolide can be isolated and produced easily by extracting from the plant Andrographis paniculata. When the compound was analyzed by in silico computational docking tools it successfully docked against the inhibitor region of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 virus with docking score of -3.094357 Kcal/mol, the docking score showed great binding when compared to synthetic compounds when they are docked against M pro such as disulfiram, tideglusib and shikonin which are -46.16 Kcal/mol, \u00c061.79 Kcal/ mol and -17.35 Kcal/mol . And it also shows great binding score when compared against recently proposed combination of three drugs namely, lopinavir, ostelmivir and ritonavir whose binding scores are -4.1Kcal/mol,-4.65 Kcal/mol and -5.11 Kcal/mol (Muralidharan et al., 2020) . Even some plant molecules which are studied to inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 failed to prove their binding score when compared with the Andrographolide. They are compounds such as kaempferol -9.41 Kcal/mol, quercetin -8.58 Kcal/mol, demethoxycurcumin -8.17 Kcal/mol, curcumin -7.31 Kcal/mol, catechin -7.05 Kcal/mol, epichatechin gallate-7.24 Kcal/mol, zingerol -6.67 Kcal/mol and gingerol -5.40 Kcal/mol respectively (Khaerunnisa et al., 2020) . Even proposed inhibitor of M pro such as PRD_002214 has a docking score of -10.466 Kcal/mol (Bouchentof & Missoum, 2020) which proclaims that Andrographolide has better properties than other proposed inhibitors. The compound possesses excellent properties of druggability as well small biomolecule. The molar refractivity of the compound confirms that the drug compound is permeable through particular membranes and can remain constant even in the midst of strong or weak solute-solvent, solventsolvent interactions. And exemplary TPSA says that it has great transport properties. Through lipophilicity of the drug compound we can know that the compound has ideal property for oral and intestinal absorption and is able to be absorbed sub-lingual as well. Through water solubility properties predicted the drug is free soluble.",
