In the conventional setting, chronic inflammatory diseases are assessed by clinical activity indices that measure clinical symptoms or by radiologic or endoscopic indices that measure tissue inflammation. Disease subtypes are often defined on the basis of medical history, physical findings, imaging parameters, serum markers, as well as endoscopic and histopathological characteristics of the disease. Noninvasive or minimally invasive diagnostic procedures present less burden and risk to patients than, for example, invasive biopsy sampling. They may thus support clinical decision-making by providing information on disease status and prognosis. The requirements of these applications cannot always be met by a single biomarker class.",

CRP production is rapidly upregulated, in the presence of an acute-phase stimulus [4]. Within 24\u201348 h the increase may be 500 to 1000-fold higher than under basal circumstances. Inversely, to its increase, the reduction of CRP may be similarly rapid, as the acute-phase response subsides, with a fall from peak with a half-time of 48 h [1]. Once the stimulus disappears, CRP concentrations quickly decrease due to CRP\u2019s short half-life. Hence, this makes CRP a valuable marker to detect the activity of IBD [4]. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation correlating well with disease activity in CD. Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates, whereas normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials [2]. The same increasing trend can be observed in UC, although CRP levels are generally lower than in CD [4]. Several studies have identified increased levels of CRP in nearly 100% of patients with CD and approximately 50% of those with UC [7].",

The sensitivity of CRP in discriminating CD from irritable bowel syndrome ranges between 70 and 100% and the sensitivity in UC between 50 and 60% [1]. Hence, CRP is a valuable biomarker in sorting out active CD from functional bowel disorders [6]. Moreover, since CRP levels tend to be higher in CD than in UC, CRP might be used to differentiate both types of IBD [1]. However, the relatively low sensitivity of the CRP test in detection of UC prohibits the use of this marker alone to identify patients with symptoms compatible with IBD, without further evaluation [7].",

            "text": "CRP distinguishes between active and quiescent IBD and trends with mucosal healing [6]. Various studies have been conducted, regarding CRP levels and their correlation to different clinical courses [4]. A retrospective analysis of Mayo Clinic data has associated moderate to greater clinical disease severity, active disease on colonoscopy, and histological severe inflammation with an elevated CRP, while 51% of UC patients with active disease also had an elevated CRP. In a follow-up investigation, among patients with symptoms of active CD and an elevated CRP, 86% exhibited evidence of inflammation at colonoscopy\n[4, 6]. This suggests that CRP has the ability to predict active mucosal inflammation. Across studies, however, it has been showed that CRP (in both UC and CD patients), when compared to calprotectin and lactoferrin, is less sensitive and has a lower correlation with mucosal inflammation as shown by endoscopy [6]. Studies in patients with CD, with clinically inactive disease and elevated CRP, have demonstrated that the latter had higher chance of relapse in the following 2 years than those with normal CRP. In UC patients, CRP elevation was significantly correlated with severe clinical activity and active disease by means of colonoscopy but not with histological inflammation [4]. Yet, some patients have had persistent, normal levels of CRP despite active disease [7]. These patients often exhibit exclusive ileal disease and low body mass index [4]. For these patients, CRP will not be a useful marker for differentiation of quiescent from active disease [7]. Generally, the value of CRP as a predictor of relapse is controversial, with some studies considering it an accurate predictor and others not. A combination of CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has also been used to predict relapse in patients with CD [4].",

The ESR determination is a commonly performed laboratory test and reflects the changes in the various acute-phase proteins [1]. The test measures the distance that erythrocytes have fallen after 1 h in a vertical column of anticoagulated blood under the influence of gravity [1]. ESR is not rapidly responsive to changes in clinical status, as the concentrations of many serum proteins vary and some have long half-lives [4]. ESR determinations have been shown to be satisfactory monitors of acute-phase response to disease after the first 24 h [1]. Therefore, ESR is less suited to detect changes in disease activity, and it fails to exhibit the real clinical course, as it may take several days to decrease even when rapid clinical improvement occurs. Hence, ESR is an indirect, crude, but fairly rapid assessment of the general acute-phase response [1, 4, 6].",

Although it is still widely used, especially as a biomarker of IBD activity, its usefulness has decreased as new methods of evaluating disease have developed [1, 6]. In UC there is a good correlation between ESR and disease activity. In CD the ESR appears to be a less accurate measure of disease activity [4]. The increase of ESR in increasing disease activity correlates more with colonic disease and does not reflect the disease activity in the small bowel [4]. Compared with CRP, during the first 24 h of inflammation , ESR will peak less rapidly, and may take days to decrease, even if the inflammation has subsided. However, CRP tests are costly, frequently unavailable, and more time-consuming to perform than the ESR [1].",

Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the two main methods used for the detection of these antibodies [8]. Moreover, the titers of these antibodies do not seem to correlate with disease activity, and ASCA levels appear to be stable for long periods. In fact, patients with CD have been reported to have still high rates of ASCA, though their last outbreak of CD was 20 years ago and their markings on gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and histology were normal [9]. Interestingly, the results vary between different populations, as the sensitivity of ASCA IgA is lower in Japanese and Chinese CD patients when compared to Caucasian CD patients [1]. This observation suggests that several distinct genetic determinants and/or environmental risk factors may influence the ASCA response [1].",

Numerous studies have been performed; in one study, ASCA antibodies were detected in 20\u201325% of healthy first-degree relatives of patients with CD. Another study showed detectable levels of ASCA in 31% of patients long before they were diagnosed with CD. For them the maximum frequency of antibodies was recorded 36 months before diagnosis [9]. These studies indicate that ASCA growth happens before or during early stages of disease. Hence, we assume that ASCA are likely produced in the context of early development of the disease, rather than as genetic markers in childhood. Further study needs to be done in order to conclude whether ASCA antibodies serve as indicators of future disease. For now, the initial event leading to IFPE is still unclear, but it is of great interest [9].",

The most commonly employed method in use as a screening method for ANCAs is indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on normal peripheral blood neutrophils [8]. But for diagnostic purposes, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used in laboratories to detect ANCAs [8, 10]. According to IIF, there are two types of fluorescence pattern: cytoplasmic granular with central interlobular accentuation (cANCA) and fine homogenous, rim-like staining of the perinuclear cytoplasm (or rim-accentuated fluorescence of the nuclei) designated as the pANCA pattern. Various target antigens of atypical pANCA have been intensively studied in IBD patients, and so far results have been conflicting regarding their potential use in clinical practice as their sensitivity and specificity are less than 60% [8]. It is likely that the target antigen for UC-related atypical pANCA is a complex conformational epitope which comprises the nuclear proteins histone H1, HMG-1, and HMG-2. Nevertheless, since the target antigen for UC-associated pANCA is yet unrecognized, sensitive and specific solid-phase methods cannot be developed [8]. The sensitivity of the IIF assay for UC reaches the 87.2% [8].",

ASMA antibodies also seemed to be positive in 24% of patients with CD who were negative for ASCA and had a lower sensitivity but higher specificity when compared with ASCA. Moreover, ACCA and ALCA antibodies have similarly exhibited low sensitivity but relatively high specificity in CD patients, compared to patients with UC [6, 7].

This suggests that the microorganism expressing the I2 gene product might be related to CD pathogenesis. This sequence derives from Pseudomonas fluorescens [8]. Studies using ELISA assays have shown 30\u201350% IgA seroreactivity against I2 in CD , 10% in UC 36\u201342% in indeterminate colitis, 19% in patients with other inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, and 5% in healthy controls [1, 6, 8].

Serum levels of TNFa are usually increased in patients with active IBD, though they are not consistently elevated [4]. Hence, TNFa determination is of limited utility as a marker of disease activity in IBD patients [4]. Nowadays, biological therapies targeting TNF\u03b1 have significantly improved the management of IBD refractory to conventional therapies, thus, turning TNF\u03b1 into a crucial mediator of this abnormal immune response [11]. The most widely used anti-TNF\u03b1 agents are infliximab and adalimumab. Infliximab\nis the best studied anti-TNF\u03b1 agent and is currently approved in the European Union for adults and children with CD and adults with UC [11]. In CD and UC, infliximab has confirmed efficacy in adults with benefits observed in both clinical remission and mucosal healing. It has also shown similar effectiveness in children with CD [11]. Evidence suggests that early treatment with infliximab may improve the natural course of the disease [11]. Other cytokines except TNFalpha have been extensively studied, but drug development based on other cytokines is still under way.",

It has antimicrobial effects and is stable in feces for 1 week [7]. Calprotectin is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and its concentration is an indirect measure of neutrophil infiltrate in the bowel mucosa [6, 7]. It is released with cell death or activation, making it a sensitive marker of inflammation [6]. Various studies identify calprotectin as a sensitive marker of activity in CD, which also correlates well with endoscopic and histological activity in UC [4, 7]. Increased levels of fecal calprotectin had a positive predictive value of 81% and a negative-predictive value of 90% for relapse of UC. In patients with CD, the positive predictive value was 87%, and the negative-predictive value was 43% [6, 7]. Its sensitivity and specificity of relapse in both CD and UC ranges approximately at 90% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity for identification of IBD in adults were 93% and 96%, while, in children, the test confirmed 92% and only 76%, respectively [4, 6, 7]. Despite calprotectin\u2019s high sensitivity and specificity, it ought not to be considered as a specific marker of inflammation, since increased levels are also found in neoplasia, polyps, microscopic colitis, allergic colitis, active celiac disease, infections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory enteropathy, increasing age, etc. [1, 6]. Relatively high levels of calprotectin are noticed in the stools of normal individuals, and this data is compatible with the hypothesis that in normal individuals most circulating neutrophils migrate through the mucosal membrane of the gastrointestinal tract wall and thereby terminate their circulating life [1].",

Furthermore, the protein\u2019s concentration increases in active IBD, compared to inactive IBD with specificity between 85 and 90%.

Another test available for HCV is an immunoblot assay (RIBA-2). Both methods are of limited use, however, because a period of several weeks separates infection and seroconversion.

During the natural course of MS, \u03b22-MG was found to be stable over time, and although urinary excretion of neopterin was found to be higher during clinical relapses, neopterin blood levels were not found to correlate with clinical and MRI measurements. Furthermore, both neopterin and \u03b22-MG are unstable and rapidly eliminated by the kidneys, and thus these molecules can be easily detected in urine specimens [34]. Urine collection is a simple and noninvasive process; however, disabled multiple sclerosis patients often have chronic urinary tract infections or asymptomatic bacterial bladder colonization\u2014due to bladder instability\u2014which both can negatively affect the urine biomarker results. Currently, measurable urine biomarkers include neopterin, nitrate/nitrite, prostaglandin metabolites, b2-MG, immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains, interleukins (IL-1, IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8), and myelin basic protein (MBP)-like material [29].",

Currently, the main role of CSF examination in MS is to support the diagnosis of MS and to exclude other diagnoses. The most useful markers are currently the presence of two or more IgG oligoclonal bands (OCBs), as well as an elevated IgG index. However, numerous other CSF biomarkers are under investigation, including kappa free light chains (KFLC), anti-myelin antibodies, sVCAM-1 (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and 24S-hydroxycholestrol [36]. At present none of them, except for the OCBs, fulfills the criteria of applicability in clinical practice and should therefore be further investigated and validated in future studies [37]. As for CSF oligoclonal banding test, it is estimated to have sensitivities between 69 and 91% with specificities between 59 and 94% for the diagnosis of MS, and when combined with MRI studies, both sensitivity (56\u2013100%) and specificity (53\u201396%) are enhanced [38].

Seropositive RA (i.e., disease associated with a positive RF test) is often correlated with more aggressive joint disease and is more commonly complicated by extra-articular manifestations than seronegative RA [62]. Rheumatoid nodules and vasculitis occur almost exclusively in seropositive patients. A positive RF test at the initial evaluation is associated with more destructive joint pathology. It has also been proposed that the rate of formation of new erosions among seropositive patients correlates with the RF titer [62]. The presence of RF increases the likelihood of a clinically significant response to rituximab which is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B lymphocytes after failure of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor therapy. Finally, the presence of RF, particularly at high titers, may antedate the clinical development of RA [61, 63].",

The sensitivity of ACPA assays for RA varies from about 50 to 75%, depending upon the assay and study population, while specificity of ACPA for RA is relatively high, usually >90% (Table 4). ACPA-positive patients with early RA are at increased risk of progressive joint damage, while ACPA testing may predict erosive disease more effectively than RF. The presence of ACPA is also predictive of more rapid radiographic progression [62]. Positive ACPA testing also appears to predict an increased risk for radiographic progression in patients with early oligo- or polyarthritis who are IgM RF negative. A decrease in ACPA titers can be seen in patients treated effectively, particularly if treated early with nonbiologic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but is less frequent and of a lesser magnitude than the decrease in IgM RF. ACPA may be detectable months or even years before the development of RA, and the proportion of individuals who are seropositive for ACPA increases progressively until clinical onset of disease [61, 63]. Finally, this biomarker is useful in the differential diagnosis of early polyarthritis, because of the relatively high specificity for RA of these autoantibodies. The presence of ACPA is highly predictive of future development of RA with positive predictive values of >90% in most studies [61, 63].",

While NPSLE is a common manifestation, its diagnosis is extremely difficult due to lack of reliable biomarkers. Because autoantibodies are clearly involved in tissue damage in other organs, autoantibodies reactive to CNS antigens naturally become the focus of the investigation of NPSLE pathogenesis and the pursuit for reliable biomarkers. Stroke in patients with SLE is likely to reflect thrombosis due to antiphospholipid antibodies. In addition, recent studies provide convincing evidence that a subset of anti-dsDNA antibodies cross-react with a pentapeptide consensus sequence that is present in the extracellular domain of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)\nreceptor. NMDA receptors bind the neurotransmitter glutamate expressed by neurons throughout the forebrain and particularly at the hippocampus. If such cross-reacting autoantibodies enter the brain upon transient breach of the blood\u2013brain barrier, they may bind to antigens expressed in different regions of the brain and induce non-inflammatory neuronal injury resulting in various neurologic and psychological changes [67]. Antibodies to ribosomal P proteins (anti-P) were initially considered extremely promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of lupus psychosis and of mood disorders. Yet, it was demonstrated that anti-P antibody testing has negligible diagnostic utility for NPSLE overall or for these particular manifestations [70]. Testing for anti-P antibody is not useful in excluding disease-mediated psychosis or mood disorder with enough certainty, since more than 60% of cases are false negative. Also, a false-positive rate of \u223c20% militates against the dependence on this laboratory test for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in lupus patients [70].",

Renal involvement occurs in 70% of affected patients and is manifested as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; it results in either death or end-stage renal failure within 2 years in more than 40% of patients. MPA and GPA were once considered life-threatening ARDs, but immunosuppressive therapy has substantially improved the survival of affected patients [71, 72].",

It is based on non-hypothesis-driven scanning platforms for identifying biomarkers and profiling the patients. Thus, the fundamental rationale in metabolomics is that perturbations caused by a disease in a biological system will lead to correlated changes in concentrations of certain metabolites. This procedure has become feasible only recently with the advent of new high-throughput technologies, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Comparison of patients with active RA and those in remission provided different baseline metabolic profiles, suggesting that efficacious treatment may affect biological changes for improved metabolic profiles. In SLE, the disease influences the metabolite profile and particularly energy, amino acid, lipid, and purine metabolism [73].",

In particular, for studies of biomarkers for diagnosis, greater attention to potential confounders would help ensure accuracy. When examining biomarkers of disease activity, emphasis should be placed on evaluating these markers longitudinally. In research regarding biomarkers of prognosis, longitudinal design and the use of validated outcome measures would provide reliable results in order to enable use in clinical decision-making process of novel biomarkers that outperforms currently available tests.
