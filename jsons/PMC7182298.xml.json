            "text": "In humans, the CD1 family has five members, designated as CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d and CD1e proteins. Among these, it has been proposed that two or perhaps three distinct groups of CD1 proteins can be discerned, based on sequence homologies, sites of expression and function. Thus, CD1a, CD1b and CD1c are typically classified as group 1 CD1 proteins, while the more divergent CD1d protein comprises group 2 (3). The CD1e protein has not been extensively studied, but it is intermediate in terms of its homology to group 1 and group 2 CD1 proteins, and appears to be unique in that its expression may be confined exclusively to intracellular compartments of myeloid lineage cells (4). Thus, we currently support the classification of CD1e as group 3 CD1. Most species studied to date show the presence of genes for multiple homologs of the human group 1 CD1 proteins, the exception being mice and rats, which only have genes encoding CD1d\u2010like proteins. The group 2 CD1 proteins appear to be even more highly conserved, and have been found in all mammals for which CD1 genes or proteins have been characterized in detail, with the exception of the guinea pig (Table 1).",

The distribution of group 1 CD1 molecules is relatively restricted, with strong expression mostly limited to immature cortical thymocytes and a variety of specialized antigen\u2010presenting cells, most notably myeloid lineage dendritic cells and a subset of B lymphocytes (1). In contrast, human and murine CD1d molecules are widely expressed on hematopoietic cells (5, 6) and have also been detected on a variety of nonhematopoietic cell types, in particular epithelial cells (7, 8).",

They are absent from the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, but can be detected in the early/recycling endosomes (9). Analysis of CD1a trafficking in freshly extracted human LC suggests that CD1a molecules present at the cell surface spontaneously internalize via clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. Most likely, they are rapidly distributed to the early/sorting endosomes and delivered to early/recycling endosomes, and from this site they recycle back to the plasma membrane (10). It is still unclear which mechanisms drive the intracellular trafficking of CD1a, as its short intracytoplasmic tail does not contain any recognizable sorting motif, in contrast to most other CD1 molecules.",

After synthesis, CD1b molecules are transported rapidly to the cell surface via the secretory pathway, and from this site they are then internalized by clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. This internalization is dependent on a tyrosine\u2010based motif of the cytoplasmic tail (YXX\u03a6, where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and \u03a6 is a bulky hydrophobic residue), probably through its interaction with cytosolic adaptor protein complex AP\u20102 (11, 13). Subsequent sorting to the late endosomal compartment may be dependent on interaction of the CD1b tail with another adaptor protein AP\u20103 (13, 14). It should be noted that these features of trafficking and localization have been described for human CD1b, but may not apply in all cases to orthologues of this protein in other species. For example, the guinea pig expresses several proteins that appear to be closely related in structure to human CD1b, but one of these (gpCD1b3) shows a pattern of cellular localization that is similar to that of human CD1a (15).",

Despite the presence of a tyrosine\u2010based endosomal targeting motif very similar to the one present in CD1b, CD1c does not accumulate to any consistently appreciable extent in the MIIC compartment, probably because it cannot interact strongly with AP\u20103 (13, 14).",

            "text": "Jayawardena\u2010Wolf et al. demonstrated that a fraction of murine CD1d coprecipitates with Ii, implying that the two molecules associate in vivo. The role of Ii on CD1d trafficking is supported by the observation that, in cells expressing murine CD1d from which the cytoplasmic tyrosine\u2010based targeting signal has been deleted, transfection of Ii results in redistribution of the mutant CD1d from the cell surface to late endosomes and lysosomes (17). Interestingly, Kang and Cresswell identified a very similar role of MHC Class II molecules in the trafficking of human CD1d (18). Taken together, these studies suggest the coexistence of two pathways of intracellular trafficking for CD1d (Fig. 2). Thus, one pathway allows newly synthesized CD1d molecules to move directly to the cell surface where they subsequently internalize to reach endosomes and MIICs. A second alternative pathway is followed by CD1d molecules that associate with the Ii (mice) or Ii/MHC class II complexes (human) in the ER. These would be predicted to enter the MIIC compartments directly as a result of intracellular sorting at the Golgi, and then subsequently be released to the cell surface after degradation of Ii and apparently still in association with MHC class II molecules. In agreement with this model, mouse CD1d trafficking is impaired in cathepsin S deficient cells, that are unable to normally degrade Ii, with accumulation of CD1d molecules in endosomal compartments where they colocalize with MHC II and Ii (19). While the currently published studies have examined Ii association only for CD1d, preliminary studies indicate that this can also be demonstrated for human CD1b (M. Sugita, V. Briken and S. A. Porcelli, unpublished data). Thus, it is possible that a similar alternative trafficking pathway resulting in direct Golgi to MIIC transport exists for at least some group 1 CD1 proteins.",

            "text": "Human CD1e has been identified only recently as a protein expressed by myeloid lineage DC (4). Analysis of CD1e mRNA from monocyte\u2010derived DC identified more than 15 mRNA species generated by alternative splicing. Some of these encode apparently full\u2010length transmembrane proteins with three extracellular domains (\u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13) or membrane\u2010associated CD1e with only one (\u03b13 only) or two \u03b1 domains (\u03b12\u03b13, \u03b11\u03b13). Yet other transcripts lack transmembrane domain sequences and appear to encode putative soluble forms of the protein. Only the membrane\u2010associated isoforms with all three extracellular domains have been shown to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), probably after they associate with \u03b22\u2010microglobulin. These molecules are exported through the trans\u2010Golgi network to an acidic compartment, most likely the late endosomes or lysosomes, where they are cleaved into a soluble form and accumulate. This intracellular traffic is controlled by a short sequence in the C\u2010terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail containing two overlapping dilysine motifs (KKXK). In immature DC, CD1e molecules are found mainly in the Golgi compartments and trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN), whereas in LPS\u2010treated DC, CD1e molecules accumulate in late endosomes and lysosomes. Notably, CD1e molecules never seem to reach the cell surface, which appears to exclude their direct participation in antigen presentation. Homologues of human CD1e have been identified in guinea pigs and in several other mammals, but their expression and intracellular distributions have not been studied to date (Table 1). However, the marked conservation of many predicted structural features of CD1e in humans and other mammals suggests that the unusual intracellular localization may be conserved, and thus may be associated with some important function of this molecule.",

A critical step was made with the isolation of a CD1b\u2010restricted human T cell line that was specific for a foreign antigen contained in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The direct isolation and characterization of the mycobacterial substance presented to this T cell line led to the initial realization that CD1\u2010presented antigens are predominantly or exclusively lipid in nature (20).",

Additional studies revealed that other human group 1 CD1 molecules, CD1a and CD1c, could also mediate presentation of mycobacterial lipid antigens. While the identities of the foreign lipid antigens presented by CD1a are still not known, one prominent CD1c\u2010presented antigen from mycobacteria has been isolated and identified as a \u03b2l\u2010mannosyl\u2010phosphoisoprenoid (22). While these mycobacterial lipid antigens are in most cases structurally divergent from mammalian lipids, it has recently been demonstrated that a variety of mammalian glycosphingolipids are also presented by human group 1 CD1 molecules (Fig. 3) (23, 24). This fascinating finding suggests that CD1\u2010presented ligands are not solely, or even predominantly, molecular patterns expressed exclusively in microbial pathogens. This is important, because it indicates that in many situations the response to lipid antigens through CD1 presentation may represent a form of adaptive rather than innate immunity, requiring a fine distinction between self and foreign lipid antigens and a mechanism for maintaining tolerance to the former.",

The best described CD1d\u2010presented antigens are synthetic glycosylceramides, and in particular a form of \u03b1\u2010galactosylceramide containing a phytosphingosine base and a long chain (C26) fatty acid (\u03b1GalCer) (Fig. 3). This unusual glycolipid was initially identified as the active component of marine sponge extracts that possessed potent antitumor activity in mice. Subsequent studies showed that \u03b1GalCer was a potent ligand for human and murine CD1d\u2010restricted natural killer T cells (NK T cells) (25, 26). These NK T cells are a population of lymphocytes characterized by the coexpression of cell surface molecules usually observed in the natural killer lineage (NK1.1, Ly49, CD69 in mice; NKR\u2010P1A, CD94 and CD69 in human), and a TCR \u03b1\u03b2 with a limited and highly biased repertoire (27). In mice, the TCR of NK T cells are assembled from an invariant TCR\u03b1 chain (V\u03b114J\u03b118; formerly designated V\u03b114J\u03b1281) paired preferentially with TCR\u03b2 chains encoded by V\u03b28.2, V\u03b27 or V\u03b22 combined with various J\u03b2 segments. Human NK T cells express TCR chains that are homologous to the murine chains: an invariant V\u03b124J\u03b115 (formerly V\u03b124J\u03b1Q), paired predominantly with V\u03b211. Attempts thus far to identify a natural homolog of \u03b1GalCer in mammalian tissues or in relevant microbial pathogens have been unsuccessful. It thus seems unlikely that this compound represents a true antigen for natural CD1d\u2010restricted immune responses, and efforts are still being made to identify the natural microbial or self antigens that are presented by CD1d. While it is generally accepted that the frequent CD1d\u2010restricted autoreactivity observed among murine NK T cells is likely to be due to recognition of self\u2010antigens presented on CD1d, the precise identity of these putative natural self ligands remains unknown. Some initial clues toward the identification of such self ligands may be provided by reports that CD1d restricted NK T cells can be activated by natural and synthetic glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) (28) and other common phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (29).",

Together, these findings on the binding of endogenous lipids by CD1 have suggested a model in which some endogenous lipids might play a chaperon\u2010like role during the biosynthesis of CD1 molecules (Fig. 4). As recently described for GPI and PI in the case of CD1d molecules, the binding of these endogenous lipids is likely to occur in the ER, shortly after association of the CD1 heavy chain with \u03b22\u2010microglobulin, and would serve to stabilize the molecule and protect the binding site from inappropriate interactions until it reached the cell surface (31, 32). After internalization of CD1 molecules, the chaperon lipids would subsequently be exchanged for other endogenous glycolipids or exogenous lipids present in endocytic compartments.",

The molecular basis for TCR recognition of lipids in the context of CD1 presentation seems to parallel in many aspects the recognition of MHC/peptide complexes. Substantial insight in this area was provided by the crystal structure of the mouse CD1d protein (33). This revealed that CD1d molecules, like MHC class I proteins, possess an antigen\u2010binding groove formed by the \u03b1l and \u03b12 domains. However, the binding groove in CD1d is narrower at its opening and deeper than the peptide\u2010binding groove in MHC molecules. In addition, it is formed mostly from two relatively large pockets (referred to as A\u2032 and F\u2032) that have a hydrophobic surface. Thus, the ligand\u2010binding groove of CD1d appears ideally suited to bind hydrophobic molecules, such as the alkyl tails of lipids and glycolipids. The general features of the MHC class I\u2010like fold with a large hydrophobic binding groove is likely to be conserved in all CD1 proteins, a view which is supported by recent structural data from the X\u2010ray crystallography of human CD1b molecules (34).",

This predicts that the hydrophobic portion of the lipid ligand interacts with the A\u2032 and F\u2032 pockets, thus anchoring the lipid in the protein such that its polar head is positioned at or outside the opening of the groove, where it is available for direct contact with the TCR (35). This model is supported by several studies analyzing the structural requirements for glycolipid recognition by various CD1\u2010restricted T cells. For example, a CD1b\u2010restricted, GMM\u2010specific T cell line responds to several forms of GMM derived from different mycobacterial species that differ in mycolic acid composition, but do not respond to structural variants of the antigen that have even extremely subtle alterations in the hydrophilic head group (35). Similarly, \u03b1GalCer analogs with shortened acyl chains (as short as 2\u2010carbons) can stimulate murine and human CD1d\u2010restricted NK T cells, while analogs which lack hydroxyl groups on carbon 3 and 4 of the sphingosine base, are not antigenic (36). These studies suggest that while the nature of the hydrophobic tail certainly plays a role in the stability of the complex formed with CD1 molecules, it is unlikely to determine the specificity of the T cell response. In contrast, the fine structure of the hydrophilic head group is critical to TCR recognition, consistent with a model in which this portion of the antigen actually makes direct contact with the TCR.",

The TCR of these cells also showed extensive junctional diversity of CDR3\u2010encoded residues. Analysis of site\u2010specific mutants of human CD1b and a CD1b\u2010specific TCR support the view that the TCR interacts both with the \u03b1\u2010helices of the CD1 molecule and with the lipid antigen protruding from its ligand binding groove (38, 39). In addition, as described previously for TCR interactions with MHC class I, the TCR of CD1\u2010restricted T cells are probably oriented diagonally to the horizontal axes of the \u03b1l and \u03b12 helices of CD1.

However, whereas the presence of the invariant V\u03b114J\u03b118 TCR \u03b1 chain is generally required for \u03b1GalCer recognition, the observation that moderately diverse TCR\u03b2 chains containing several different V\u03b2 regions (mainly V\u03b28, V\u03b27 and V\u03b22) could be associated with \u03b1GalCer\u2010reactive NKT cells suggested that the TCR\u03b2 chains might not play a significant role in the recognition of the ligand (36). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the CDR3 length of the V\u03b2 chains of \u03b1GalCer\u2010reactive NKT cells seems to show little or no evidence for selection for particular CDR3\u03b2 amino acid residues (41). The lack of stringent selection for CDR3\u03b2 sequences suggests that the selection for V\u03b28, V\u03b27 and V\u03b22 probably involves the CDR1 and CDR2 regions of these V\u03b2 segments, most likely because of their ability to interact effectively with the \u03b1\u2010helical surface of CD1d rather than with the bound antigen.",

This observation suggests that mouse CD1 might be involved in the recognition of a limited number of ligands with a relatively fixed structure. Possibilities for these ligands include either microbial lipids that function as pathogen associated molecular patterns, or possibly normal self or modified self lipids that are induced under conditions of stress. The recognition of such intrinsically foreign or stress\u2010induced ligands with a fixed structure would be consistent with the view that the CD1d system is more oriented toward innate rather than adaptive immune recognition. However, it is important to note that nearly all of the TCR repertoire analyses summarized above have focused on populations of CD1\u2010restricted T cells that show autoreactivity to the CD1d molecule. It remains possible that other populations of nonautoreactive CD1d\u2010restricted T cells may exist that use a more extensive repertoire of TCR to recognize a more diverse array of potential antigens. This possibility is strongly implied by a recent study demonstrating nonautoreactive human CD1d\u2010restricted T cells with highly diverse TCR that can be expanded by in vitro stimulation with \u03b1GalCer (44)",

Analysis of the cellular trafficking and antigenic potency of different molecular variants of the GMM antigen revealed that GMM with short alkyl chains (C32 GMM; Fig. 3) could rapidly load onto CD1b at the cell surface of dendritic cells (DC), whereas presentation of GMM with long alkyl chains (C80 GMM) by DC was a slower process that required delivery of the antigen to endosomal compartments. Subcellular fractionation revealed that DC sort the different forms of GMM antigen based on alkyl chain length, preferentially concentrating the long\u2010chain antigen in lysosomal compartments. Disruption of endosomal trafficking of CD1b by mutation of the targeting motif in its cytoplasmic tail increased the surface expression of CD1b as expected, and increased the presentation of C32 GMM while inhibiting the presentation of C80 GMM. Interestingly, presentation of GMM by nonprofessional APC gave opposite results with a preferential presentation of C32 GMM. These data demonstrate the coexistence of endosomal and nonendosomal pathways for antigen presentation by CD1b. It is thus suggested that specialized APC like immature DC, which are capable of phagocytosis, sort the antigens based on alkyl chain length and preferentially concentrate the long chain antigens in lysosomal compartments where they can be loaded on CD1b. In contrast, nonphagocytic CD1b+ cells such as thymocytes might preferentially present short chain self glycolipids, loaded during CD1b trafficking through the intracellular compartments to the cell surface or at the plasma membrane. In this way, they could provide self\u2010ligands for thymic selection of CD1\u2010restricted T cells.",

In addition, in marked contrast to CD1b, the presentation of glycolipid antigen by CD1c is not significantly reduced by deletion of the cytoplasmic tail endosomal targeting motif of the protein, and is also relatively resistant to the effects of inhibitors of endosomal acidification (chloroquine and concanannycin B) (12).

However, Kronenberg and colleagues reported that immobilized recombinant murine and human CD1d molecules could be loaded at neutral pH with \u03b1GalCer for presentation to NKT cells (47). The study published by Gumperz et al. partially resolved this discrepancy by showing that while the binding and presentation of \u03b1GalCer was detectable at neutral pH, it was optimal at pH 4 with a 4\u2010fold increase in the NKT cell response (29).

Both of these mechanisms were originally suggested by studies of human CD1b (48). In addition, a recent study of the presentation of a disaccharide\u2010containing synthetic analog of \u03b1GalCer (Gal(\u03b1l\u21922)GalCer) revealed a clear requirement for removal of the terminal sugar by a lysosomal enzyme prior to effective presentation to CD1d\u2010restricted T cells (49). This provided a clear precedent for the requirement of enzymatic cleavage of the carbohydrate portion of a glycolipid antigen in a lysosomal compartment prior to its presentation to CD1\u2010restricted T cells. Based on these findings, it seems that enzymatic trimming of the carbohydrate portions of natural CD1\u2010presented antigens is likely to occur, although direct evidence for this is still lacking.

This observation suggests that a folding of the alkyl chain occurs during the binding to CD1b that brings these two distant hydrophilic components into close proximity to allow them to form a combinatorial epitope. Interestingly, the recent crystal structure data on CD1b supports the possibility that the groove of this molecule could potentially hold a very long chain mycolic acid in a folded configuration that might allow such positioning of the two hydrophilic components at the TCR binding interface (34).",

To date, this hypothesis has been examined in mycobacterial infections only, although limited data also suggest the capacity of CD1 molecules to present antigens derived from Gram negative bacteria. Perhaps the strongest evidence for an effective role of antigen\u2010specific CD1\u2010restricted T cells in host defense against mycobacteria is the discovery that CD1c\u2010restricted T cells specific for mycobacterial isoprenoid glycolipids are common in individuals previously infected with M. tuberculosis, but are not seen in naive control subjects (22).

The NK T cells begin to reappear in the liver and the spleen after two or three days but their numbers remain lower than in control mice for several weeks (57, 58). A striking observation is that the NK T cells that repopulate the spleen have a Th2 phenotype (59). Several hypotheses have been raised to explain this phenomenon. One possibility is that \u03b1GalCer could polarize existing Th0 NK T cells, or NK T precursors, towards a Th2 phenotype. Alternatively, distinct populations of mature NK T cells may produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and \u03b1GalCer could selectively induce cell death of the Th1 NK T cells. Yet another possibility relates to the recently demonstrated developmentally regulated switch in NK T cell cytokine production. Two groups identified a thymic precursor of NK T cells that binds \u03b1GalCer\u2010loaded CD1d tetramers but does not express NK1.1, and showed that these cells after undergoing proliferation give rise to CD4+ and CD4\u20138\u2013 NK1.1+ NK T cells in the periphery (60, 61). Interestingly, these NK1.1 negative precursors of mature NK T cells appear to emigrate from the thymus, and produce predominantly IL\u20104 upon stimulation with \u03b1GalCer. After one to several days in the extrathymic tissues, they appear to acquire NK1.1 expression, and then produce IFN\u03b3 almost exclusively upon stimulation (61). Thus, systemic injection of \u03b1 GalCer may induce cell death in the majority of mature extrathymic NK T cells, leading to a subsequent repopulation of the tissues with recent thymic emigrants that will produce exclusively or mainly Th2 cytokines upon restimulation. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the Th2 polarization of NK T cells following \u03b1 GalCer injection is relatively short lived, lasting no more than a few weeks (Dutronc Y, Porcelli SA, unpublished data).",

Activation of NK T cells by \u03b1GalCer inhibits the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBV\u2010transgenic mice. This effect is associated with the production of IFN\u03b3 and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and with activation of NK cells but not of conventional T cells (67). In a different model of hepatitis B infection, Baron et al. showed that a distinct population of CD1d\u2010restricted T cells that were not reactive to \u03b1GalCer was activated in response to hepatocytes expressing HBV antigens, and that this response produced hepatitis (68). Interestingly, a Th1\u2010biased CD1d\u2010restricted T cell population expressing diverse TCR was also identified recently in the livers of humans with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is not known yet if these cells play a protective role against the infection, or if they contribute to the development of tissue damage (69).",

These effects have generally been attributed to the induction of IFN\u03b3 secretion by \u03b1GalCer. Recently, it has also been reported that administration of \u03b1GalCer to mice with a suboptimal dose of irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites or suboptimal doses of recombinant viruses expressing malarial antigens enhances protective antimalarial immunity, thus indicating an adjuvant\u2010like property of this NK T cell activator (70).",

However, NK T cells are not believed to directly mediate the cytotoxicity against tumor cells that is induced by \u03b1 GalCer in most tumor models, which is actually mediated by the NK cells (58). The critical elements of this activity of \u03b1 GalCer are the production of IFN\u03b3 by NK T cells and of IL\u201012 by dendritic cells, which amplifies IFN\u03b3 production. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells that is induced by \u03b1GalCer appears to be perforin\u2010independent and FasL\u2010independent. NK T cells can also be activated to produce IFN\u03b3 directly by IL\u201012, and thus participate in the anti\u2010metastatic activities of this cytokine (71).",

Two different studies suggest that NK T could also have a suppressive role on tumor immunity. Terabe et al. observed, in a model where the tumor spontaneously regresses after initial growth and then recurs, that tumor recurrence was due to the incomplete elimination of tumor cells by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and that this is linked to a suppressive effect of NK T cells on CTL induction, mediated by the production of IL\u201013 (73). Apparently similar findings were reported by Moodycliffe et al. who showed, by adoptive transfer, that NK T cells from UV\u2010irradiated mice have a strong suppressive activity on immune responses to a UV\u2010induced regressor tumor (74).",

The observation that \u03b1GalCer administration in vivo can give rise to Th2 polarized NK T cells suggests that this compound could be used to influence the course of these diseases. This idea has been evaluated in two experimental models to date, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and type 1 diabetes of NOD mice, and has shown encouraging results in both cases. In EAE, \u03b1GalCer injection was able to suppress the development of EAE (76). No protection was observed in IL\u20104 KO and IL\u201010 KC mice, highlighting the critical role of Th2 cytokines in this protective effect.

As the missing pieces of information in our understanding of CD1 and the T cells that recognize it begin to be filled in, the appreciation of the potential role of lipid antigen recognition in the immune response continues to grow. Given the broad range of antigens in this chemical class, it seems likely that adaptive T cell mediated immune responses against foreign microbial lipids could represent important targets for generating resistance against certain pathogens. This may be particularly true for highly successful pathogens like M. tuberculosis or Plasmodium falciparum, which have clearly evolved multiple strategies to evade or subvert immune recognition. The same may be true for certain tumors, in which modified or aberrantly expressed glycolipids could represent a major basis for immune recognition. These aspects of the CD1\u2010restricted response are thus likely to have relevance to immunotherapies of infectious and neoplastic disease through novel approaches to vaccine development.",

After association with \u03b22\u2010microglobulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), CD1a molecules are transported to the plasma membrane (PM) through the secretory pathway. CD1a spontaneously internalizes via clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. It is not known whether this internalization requires association with other molecules. After internalization, CD1a recycles to the plasma membrane through early/sorting and early/recycling endosomes (EE/RE). Top right: CD1b and CD1d. The cellular distributions of CD1b and CD1d molecules are very similar. After expression at the cell surface, the interactions of the intracytoplasmic tails of CD1b and CD1d with the cytosolic adaptor complex AP\u20102 mediate their internalization into clathrin\u2010coated pits and delivery to early endosomes. From there, they access the late endosomes (LE), the lysosomes and the MHC Class II compartments (MIIC/Lys) through their interaction with another cytosolic adaptor, AP\u20103. CD1d molecules undergo several rounds of recycling to the cell surface (\u2018striped\u2019 arrows) and tend to accumulate in the LE and MIIC/Lys over time. CD1b and CD1d that have been loaded with lipid antigens within the endocytic system escape to the cell surface and presumably accumulate there for antigen presentation. Bottom left: CD1c. CD1c molecules transit to the cell surface through the secretory pathway and are internalized via clathrin\u2010coated vesicles through their interaction with AP\u20102. Most of the molecules recycle to the cell surface through the EE/RE, but a small fraction can be detected in the LE. Bottom right: CD1e. Alternative splicing potentially leads to the generation of various forms of CD1e in the ER (see text). Only CD1e molecules with three lumenal \u03b1 domains can associate with \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (\u03b22\u2010m) and leave the ER.

These most likely enter the MIIC compartment before being expressed at the cell surface as a result of sorting at the Golgi (pathway 2).

CD1b is known to present both free and glycosylated forms of these, including a wide variety of different mycolate structures distinguished by variations in their chain lengths, the presence or absence of double bonds or cyclopropyl groups, and the presence or absence of oxygen containing substitutions (R group) near the distal end of the longer meromycolate branch.

Two of the many potential forms of glucose monomycolate are illustrated, both of which are known to be presented by human CD1b. Center: glycosphingolipids.
