Due to a lack of awareness and an inaccessibility of information, frontline health workers in non-fever departments did not take any protective measures, which led to a greatly increased risk of medical infection. A large portion of health worker infections occurred through contact between health workers and asymptomatic patients or mildly symptomatic patients of COVID-19 during the early phase of the outbreak. Many infected medical personnel were located in departments that are considered low-risk, such as ophthalmology, neurology and gastroenterology and so on. This was due to insufficient cognition, inadequate protection and inaccessible information (3). There was an anaesthesiologist infected by an orthopaedic patient who was in the incubation period in the authors' hospital on 19 January 2020. The encounters of these Chinese health workers should warn health workers all over the world; COVID-19 is more contagious than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whether symptomatic or asymptomatic/latent (4, 5) . Differing from SARS, the viral load of asymptomatic and latent COVID-19 patients is high and comparable to that of symptomatic patients (6) . Some asymptomatic patients, mildly infectious and latent patients became very important sources of infection during this period of time (7, 8) .",

However, many people in Wuhan had not yet realised the severity of the outbreak and were continued to hold all kinds of gatherings. The situation was worsening, and along with a dramatic increase in cases of COVID-19, the number of health worker infections had also increased significantly. Due to the poor control of the epidemic in the early stage and a severely insufficient of the supply of nucleic acid test kits, patients were not detected in a timely manner. All of the wards in the hospital became intensive care units, accompanied with inadequate rescue ventilators, monitors and other instruments and equipment, as well as professional doctors and nurses. This overwhelmed the healthcare system and resulted in a serious run-up of medical resources. Cross infections occurred between COVID-19 patients and ordinary patients or normal people. Many health workers were unable to achieve comprehensive protection, and even needed downgraded protection. At this stage, health workers suffered from multiple infections due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical apparatus, inadequate or even degraded protection and an overload of work.",

Meanwhile, medical supplies from all over the world had also arrived. Medical device manufacturers in China had cancelled annual leave and resumed production. This alleviated the emergency situation with regard to medical supplies, and following this, the government constructed 16 Fang Cang makeshift hospitals with a capacity of more than 13,000 beds (10, 11) . During this period, the \"four categories of people\" included were confirmed cases, suspected cases, fever patients and close contacts, all of which had been screened, treated and isolated in different places according to infection control principles. The implementation of these series of measures slowed down the spread of the pandemic and achieved a phased victory. Now, all COVID-19 patients have been cured, lockdown has been lifted in Wuhan, normal work and production order are gradually recovering.",

Whereas, if the result is negative, an appointment should be made at an ordinary hospital for treatment. Upon admission to a general hospital, there should be strict buffering and isolation measures: the patient must first stay in a single room on a first-level buffer ward, after completing a second antibody and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 screening, they should be transferred to a secondary buffer ward, without symptoms. Surgery could be performed on patients who are asymptomatic for 7 days after admission and who had received two negative nucleic acid and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2, with no exposure to the environment outside of the hospital, according to standard protection procedures.",

Many countries may not receive timely and effective testing, and moreover, there is the potential for interpersonal transmission during the incubation period (5). This period of time could cause unconscious large-scale spread. Secondly, this relies on all patients being willing to wear masks, when wearing a mask effectively informs everyone that he/she is a patient, and some patients may be unwilling to wear a mask based on this. If they are not effectively isolated, these people would also become a huge source of infection, and cross-infection would happen between a patient and a normal person. Therefore, everyone should wear a mask to protect themselves and others.",

Controversially, some researchers found that universal masking in the community may mitigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and may be a necessary adjunctive public health measure in a densely populated city like Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) (22) . Masking is a continuous form of protection to stop the spreading of saliva and respiratory droplets to others or from others, and to the environment or from the environment to the susceptible by hands through touching of nose, mouth and eye. Therefore, it should be necessary for surgical masks to be worn at least in all medical staff. At the same time, we should not emphasize physical isolation and neglect behavioural isolation. Hand hygiene is a pivotal self-protection measure. According to the WHO, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people through close contact and droplets, not by airborne transmission (21) . Therefore, minimising contact with patients or suspected patients, maintaining distance and performing regular hand hygiene may be more effective than PPE in isolation. As such, we should try our best to complete works by telephone, video conference, WeChat and other applications. For example, we have opened online consultations, contactless medication and electronic medical records and prescriptions, including wireless remote monitoring of analgesia systems for postoperative analgesia management, etc. In addition to electronic and paperless technologies, artificial intelligence technology should be more fully utilized. On the one hand, it can reduce the contact between health workers and patients. On the other hand, it can decrease the heavy workload of health workers, thereby better protecting health workers. At the same time, society must be prepared to fight the virus for a long time, and even if a hospital location has been reduced to a low-risk area, doctors should still perform hand hygiene regularly and wear masks, as well as be prepared to co-exist with the virus.",

Similar to the flight attendants, medical personnel must protect themselves before they can protect others. In the early phase of the virus there was an insufficient awareness and inadequate medical supplies that led to too many health workers becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although the WHO recommended rational use PPE, Zhong's study found that one (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 as compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre. The study suggests that using Level 3 PPE is more likely to reduce the risk of anaesthetic staff acquiring COVID-19, even from patients with mild symptoms (23) . We know that PPE is still in short supply, and with the progress of the epidemic, there may be further shortages. With the gradual control of the epidemic, some countries may reduce the amount of PPE to medical personnel due considerations regarding medical costs. All of this will put medical personnel into situations where they are exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is not a responsible or humane action. In order to ensure the safety of health workers and patients, hospitals and governments must fully coordinate and make an effort to prevent health worker infections with COVID-19.",

In non-infectious departments, it is important to be extremely vigilant in terms of infection prevention and control strategies. Protective measures need to be strengthened for medical personnel in non-infectious departments. For countries and regions with severe epidemics, if conditions permit, universal testing should be carried out as soon as possible, and patients admitted to hospital should undergo strict screening and early diversion and isolation. In my opinion, all protection levels should be increased by one level according to the classification of protection principles to health workers, because of the existence of asymptomatic and latent patients.",

Furthermore, the timely and accurate disclosure of epidemic information from various countries, centre for disease control (CDC) and health departments are critical to contain the epidemic and protect health workers.
