Approximately 80\u201385% of all lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (2). Many efforts have been made to improve the discovery of lung cancer. However, due to the lack of typical early clinical symptoms and signs, the early diagnosis rate of lung cancer is low. Most patients have developed to the middle and advanced stage in diagnosis and, therefore, missed the best time for patients with surgical resection (3). Recently, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted drug therapy are the first choices for killing tumor cells and prolonging the survival time of the patients. The key signaling pathways contributed to the lung cancer cell growth and metastasis have been confirmed as we have made great progress in our understanding of tumor biology (4). The dominant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in the course of lung cancer have received continuous attention and their core roles and basic contributions to the behavior of tumor cells became clear (5).",

            "text": "Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24) belongs to the small GTPase family that can hydrolyze the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into inactive GDP and negatively regulate Rho family GTPases such as RhoA and Rac1 and, therefore, is strongly associated with the onset and progression of cancer (6\u20138). ARHGAP24 inactivates Rac1 in mouse podocytes, and a mutant form is associated with familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (9). DLC1, a new member of GAP family, has been found to possess RhoGAP activity and associates with the apoptosis and proliferation of breast cancer and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells (10,11). ARHGAP21 is highly expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (12), and ARHGAP21 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells (13). Downregulated ARHGAP24 was observed in renal cancer, and ARHGAP24 overexpression-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, along with restrained cell proliferation of renal cancer (14,15). ARHGAP24 overexpression significantly reduced growth of tumors from breast cancer HCC1954 and MDA-MB-231 cells implantation (16). In addition, ARHGAP24 promoted sorafenib-induced decrease of the viability, migration and invasion in breast cancer cells (17). Our previous study demonstrated that ARHGAP24 silencing promoted lung cancer cell migration and invasion through activating \u03b2-catenin signaling (18). However, it is rarely known about the functional role of ARHGAP24 in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis of lung cancer and the underlying mechanism involved except for its downregulation in lung adenocarcinoma (19).",

            "text": "STATs are a class of DNA-binding proteins that form part of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, including STAT1\u2013STAT6, which are of great importance in cellular immune response, cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation (20,21). STAT6 has been shown to act as a co-activator of transcription factors. Inhibition of interleukin 13-induced STAT6 activation resulted in decreased Lewis lung cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro and tumor formation in vivo (22). STAT6-specific small interfering RNA inhibited cell viability, colony formation and induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells by downregulating the Bcl-xL expression through binding to the Bcl-xL promoter (23). In contrast, STAT6 overexpression inhibited G1/S transition through increasing p27 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in breast cancer cells by binding to the p27 promoter (24). Moreover, bioinformatics analysis predicted that STAT6 can bind to the promoter of WWP2, which was a target of micro RNA 140 that downregulated in lung cancer and suppressed cell growth (25), suggesting that STAT6/WWP2 may participate in the development of lung cancer. There is a general view around that Rho GTPases involve in the tumorigenesis through mediating not only the Rho pathway (13) but also the STATs pathway (26,27). These researches prompted us to explore the functional role of ARHGAP24 in the regulation of the STAT6-WWP2 pathway in lung cancer.",

Here, the decreased RhoA and Rac1 activity in A549 and NCI-H460 cells were also observed with ARHGAP24 overexpression (Figure 3C). Rho family GTPases have been implicated in controlling cell proliferation and gene expression through regulating STATs transcriptional activity (26,27).

WWP2 was highly expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, and WWP2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and G0\u2013G1 cell cycle arrest in lung and live cancer cells (33,34) and, thereby, may be a useful therapeutic target. In the present study, WWP2 overexpression in lung cancer cells also increased cell proliferation and inhibited cell cycle arrest, along with decreased p27 expression, which were reversed by ARHGAP24 overexpression. So far, p27 has been identified to be a substrate of WWP1 (35) and we, therefore, assumed that WWP2 may also cause degradation of p27. Our Co-IP and ubiquitination analysis demonstrated that WWP2 interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression significantly promoted the ubiquitination of p27. These data suggested that the cell cycle transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase in lung cancer cells might be regulated by WWP2 through ubiquitination of P27. Meanwhile, other studies have previously showed that inhibiting WWP2-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor Oct4 promoted tumorigenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in NOD/SCID mice (36), and WWP2 serves as a tumor suppressor leading to cell cycle arrest through ubiquitination of the Notch3 signaling in ovarian cancer (37). Our bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that WWP2, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase interacting with ARHGAP24 and may induce ubiquitination of ARHGAP24, was predicted by the UbiBrowser database (data not shown), which was consistent with the findings that WWP2 overexpression significantly inhibited the ARHGAP24 expression, suggesting a feedback loop between ARHGAP24 and WWP2 existed in lung cancer. However, the interaction between ARHGAP24 and WWP2 and the degradation of ARHGAP24 induced by WWP2 need further investigation.",

These studies suggest that the STAT6-WWP2-P27 axis may represent a potential therapeutic target for treatment of human lung cancer.",
