Indeed these healthcare professionals are under excessive workload pressure and psychological distress during the pandemic, which can lead to caregiver burnout.10 Pediatricians, especially those who have children at home, not only have concerns about passing the infection to their children but also about not caring enough for their children during quarantine period, considering school closures and social distancing policies.8 Therefore, healthcare systems should be very careful to address the physical and mental health of healthcare professionals. Easy access to personal protective equipment, especially for those who are visiting patients with COVID-19, and psychological support for those who are losing their patients and colleagues, especially for those who cannot see their family members for long periods, are necessary.",
