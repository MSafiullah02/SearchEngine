            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection continues to cause economically important diseases in poultry while different geno-and serotypes continue to circulate globally. Two infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene revealed a close relation to the QX-like genotype which has not been detected in Sudan before. Whole genome analysis of IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate by next generation sequencing revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides harbouring 13 open reading frames: 5\u2032-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032. Highest nucleotide sequence identity of 93% for the whole genome was found with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906, the Italian IBV isolate ITA/90254/2005 and the 4/91 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate clustered together with viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis gave evidence for distinct patterns of origin of RNA in the Sudanese isolate in multiple genes. Several sites of recombination were scattered throughout the genome suggesting that the Sudan-QXlike strain emerged as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental viruses from 4/ 91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005 genotypes. The Sudanese QX-like isolate is plausibly genetically different from IBV strains previously reported in Africa and elsewhere.",

Globally distributed IBV induces an acute, highly contagious infectious disease affecting chickens and results in huge annual losses in the poultry industry. IBV was first reported in North Dakota, USA, by Schalk and Hawn 1931 (Schalk & Hawn, 1931 ) as a novel respiratory disease affecting chickens. Only chickens and pheasants act as the natural hosts for IBV (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) . IBV initially infects the respiratory tract; for some IBV strains further virus spread may involve kidneys and oviduct causing reduction of growth rate, decreased performance and reduction of egg quality and quantity (Cavanagh, 2003) . Also another shift of tissue tropism causing proventriculitis has been recorded (Yu et al., 2001a) . The infection spreads by aerosols, direct contact and indirectly through contaminated fomites (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) .",

The N protein is a major structural protein, which is highly conserved among different IBV serotypes. The spike (S) glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is another major structural protein of the IBV; it is post translationally cleaved into the S1 (N terminal part) and S2 fragments. In their matured forms the S1 constitutes trimers of the globular head while the S2 forms the trimerized stalk domain of the peplomer spikes in the viral lipid envelop (Cavanagh, 2007; Belouzard et al., 2012) . The S1 protein carries the receptors binding site and thus plays an important role in tissue tropism and induction of protective immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . Along the S1 gene three hypervariable regions (HVRs) are distinguishable that are targets of neutralizing and serotype specific antibodies (Moore et al., 1997; Cavanagh et al., 1988) . Variation in these epitopes has been Infection, Genetics and Evolution 46 (2016) 42-49 implicated in escape from vaccine-induced immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012) .",

New S1 genotypes of IBV that are often also showing antigenic variation and, hence, define new serotypes, appear to emerge frequently in different parts of the world (Jackwood, 2012) . Frequent mutations have been made accountable for the emergence and evolution of multiple S1 variants (Jackwood, 2012; Cavanagh et al., 1992) including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and also recombination between different strains (Adzhar et al., 1997; Hewson et al., 2014) .

The complete genome of the Ck/Sudan/ AR251-15/2014 strain as obtained by next generation sequencing was found to be 27,646 nucleotides (nt) in length, including both UTR 5\u2032 and the poly (A) tail. The complete genome sequence of the Ck/ Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate has been assigned into the GenBank sequence database in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number KX272465. The sequence obtained showed a classical IBV genome organization with 13 open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5\u2032-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032 (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Across the whole genome the highest identities were seen with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 (93%; accession KP036502), an Italian IBV isolate (ITA/90254/2005; 93%; accession FN430414), and the 4/91 vaccine strain (93%; accession KF377577). Overall nucleotide identities of 92% and 90% across the whole genome were obtained compared to the most commonly used IBV vaccine strains, H120 and M41, respectively. However, the S1 gene revealed identities of only 76.6 and 76.7% to these latter strains. Similarity searches using each ORF of the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/ 2014 separately produced variable rankings with other IBV reference and vaccine strains: IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 revealed higher sequence identities of the 1b, S, 3a, 3b, E, M, ORFs with QX and QX-like viruses. On the contrary, the 1a, 4c, 5a, 5b and N ORFs showed higher sequence identities with the H120, 4/91 and IBVUkr27-11 (4/91 like) strains (Table 2) . ORF 4b revealed overall low identities with all genotypes as shown in Table 2 . ORF 6b showed mixed identity values with either QX-like viruses or with 4/91. These findings suggested a possible recombination between different IBV genotypes shaping the genome of the Sudanese isolate. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full genome sequence revealed a close relation with the QX-like viruses from Italy, Sweden and South Africa (Fig. S1) . By phylogenetic analysis based on the whole S1-gene according to (Valastro et al., 2016) it appeared that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 is closely related to ITA/90254/ 2005 and the previously reported recombinant strains detected in South Africa (Ck/ZA/3665/11) and Sweden (Ck/SWE/0658946/10) which are clustered together within GI-19 lineage (Fig. 3) .",

The start of the ORF1a gene revealed a high frequency of recombination events with 4/91.
