However, surveillance is still typically targeted at a relatively limited number of specified diseases, and, maybe more importantly, there is a very significant global disparity in national disease detection systems and methodology. In particular, public health efforts and patient treatment are hampered by different obstacles: the use of different, specialized, expensive and difficult-to-compare detection techniques; a lack of collaboration between different microbiological fields; (inter)national politics on the disclosure of (patient) information and research data; intellectual property rights; and, a lack of sufficient diagnostic capacities particularly in developing countries. A more effective and rational approach to the prevention of microbial threats is essential at the global level. Efforts to mitigate the effects of infectious threats, focusing on improved surveillance and diagnostic capabilities, are crucial [11] . With recent technological advances and declining costs in the next generation sequencing field, these tools will play an increasingly important role in the surveillance and identification of new and previously unrecognized pathogens in both animals and humans but also for identification and characterization of traditional pathogens.

To complete the picture of the disease burden and economic cost of human disease related to animals a number of endemic human infections that are continuously transferred from animals (e.g. salmonellosis, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, rabies, cysticercosis) should also be considered. It is estimated that more than six out of every ten emerging infectious diseases in humans are the partial genome information, such as epidemiological markers, often is sufficient for patient management and basic surveillance objectives, from a public health perspective the increasing capacity for more extensive sequencing most likely will increase the depth of information gathered on pathogens and disease. Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes for instance may generate future threats; influenza A viruses for example are able to undergo reassortment if a single cell is concurrently infected with more than one virus [12] .

In September 2011 the first international GMI conference was organised in Brussels 1 to discuss the possibility to use WGS as a microbiological diagnostic tool on a global scale [27] . At this stage several preconditions for a successful initiation of an initiative of this sort seemed to have been met: (1) WGS had become mature and a potential serious alternative for other genotyping techniques, (2) the price of WGS had been falling dramatically and was now in some cases below the price of traditional methods, (3) vast amounts of IT resources and a fast internet had become available in most parts of the world, and (4) suggestions had been made that a One Health (human/animal) approach could enable improved control of infectious diseases [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Global Microbial Identifier (GMI) Initiative"}, {"text": "Currently, GMI organizes annual meetings to discuss progress and future development.

Commercial involvement may on the one hand put limitations on the development of the GMI database and the speed at which it will evolve.

Metadata relative to the sequence data of a clinical isolate in the database would for instance be patient demographics, geographical location and method of isolation etc. The more details there are in the metadata the more detailed the tracking and tracing of microorganism can be. However, a higher level of detail can also result in political and/or privacy/ethical complications, especially for the people publishing the data [29] . Without metadata, one would have a 'genotype' database only containing peta-to exabytes of WGS data. This would already be a giant step for mankind as we will discover many new genomes and microbial communities. However, to use genomes for infectious disease investigation and epidemiology, metadata are essential. The list and structure of metadata should be concise and include only what is defined as essential while excluding redundant or unethical information. For instance, making a distinction between men and women, children and the elderly would be very informative and may be essential for clinical data. However, it would be under discussion whether to include race in the list of metadata, even though there might be situations imaginable for which having such metadata would help solve scientific questions. Also, different fields of research or policy making may have use for different metadata. For instance, economists studying the economic cost of a certain disease will be interested in the number of outbreaks and relations between different economically important sectors e.g. specific food or food preparing sectors, while public health specialists and clinicians might be more interested in resistance phenotypes, treatment options etc. In general, it is thus essential to generate a list of metadata that can be considered essential for each sample. In addition, per discipline this list may be extended with field specific metadata which are essential for each individual field. Also, there should be a list of metadata to be avoided by GMI. Such thinking would bring us roughly three lists of metadata: the minimal essential, the field specific list, and the list of metadata to be excluded. To help the discussion on this one may categorize each of these three lists further into essential and optional data. Table 2 .2 gives a very basic and simplified example of how such lists might look like to help the discussions on what these lists should finally comprise. Generating the different field specific list in a collaborative manner as done in GMI will potentially be beneficial for the end results, since different sectors would be able to follow each other's progress and may minimize redundancy in the different lists. Furthermore, it should be decided which data should be collected but kept confidential and only accessible by the submitter and others with permission of the submitters. For instance, should it be open source information if a specific producer is linked to a specific microorganism and/or outbreak, or should such data be managed (and kept secret or open) by the relevant regulatory agencies? These are examples of metadata that different microbiological fields would like to collect and serves to illustrate the concept. Further discussion in GMI will be needed to generate agreed lists of metadata required for each microbiology field, and as the technology progress these list may have to be updated There are a number of technical questions adding to the complexity of the issue. Should reference strain data have a different set of metadata than the metadata required when submitting and/or comparing one's samples to the GMI database? And, where to best store all the metadata? The different types of metadata originating from different fields might be centrally stored which will have advantages for retrieving and working with them, and for ensuring the open source character of the database. However, this is not necessary and by using the right identifiers, different metadata databases may be generated that connect to a central WGS database. Central storage of all kinds of metadata may bring the advantage of having a one stop shop for everything, and it may help to find new cross links between data from different fields.

The GMI 2015 proficiency test was fully rolled out by December 15 (supported by the EU/COMPARE programme (www.compare-europe.eu) and the USFDA GenomeTrakr and Microbiologics \u00ae . This first global proficiency test in this area had a focus on Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and allowed for sign-up for each species separately (see www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org). 55 laboratories, from all continents, signed up for the test. The main objective of this proficiency test was to assess the feasibility of achieving reliable laboratory results of consistently good quality within the area of DNA preparation, sequencing, and analysis (e.g. for the use relative to phylogeny, MLST, resistance genes etc.). This will in time ensure or enable harmonization and standardization of whole genome sequencing and data analysis, with the final aim to produce comparable data for the GMI initiative, and thereby consistent data for the GMI database. A further objective is to assess and improve the data uploaded to databases such as NCBI, EBI and DDBJ. Therefore, the laboratory analysis work performed for this type of proficiency testing should be done employing the methods routinely used in the individual laboratories. The proficiency testing performed in this area has consisted of two wet-lab and one dry-lab components targeting Salmonella, E. coli and S. aureus. The wet-lab components assess the laboratories' ability to perform DNA preparation, sequencing procedures and analysis of epidemiological markers whereas the dry component assesses the ability to analyse a whole-genome-sequencing dataset and distinguish between clonally related and sporadic genomes. At present (September 2016) the GMI2016 proficiency testing is ongoing. The future vision of the proficiency testing is to target lower priority bacterial pathogens as well as to develop a parallel proficiency testing regime targeting viruses (http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/News-and-Events/Previous-meetings/7th-Meeting-on-GMI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality Assurance and Testing"}, {"text": "Other laboratory methods are being discussed and optimized for use in GMI, including consideration of how to include other types of microorganisms in proficiency tests and how to initiate parallel viral pilot proficiency test schemes including RNA methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality Assurance and Testing"}, {"text": "Next to quality assurance at the laboratory level it will be important to have a reliable source of analytical tools that cover the different tasks requested by the GMI users and are of sufficient quality to be used in different (sometimes more sensitive) settings than basic research, for instance in clinical settings. GMI aims to define the functional requirements for these tools from the perspective of end-users (clinical, public health, research) in terms of applications needed (identification, outbreak detection etc.) and priority microorganisms and diseases. To do so, GMI maps the currently available analytical software tools as well as developments in the field and benchmark them against the needs of GMI end-users in order to identify implementation gaps and projects that may fill those gaps. By this mapping effort and through software testing, GMI aims to construct a central portal of tools, to indicate a quality level, and state the usefulness and the user friendliness of the different tools for the different GMI end-users. Through this effort it will be possible to provide guidance for further development of (new) analytical tools.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality Assurance and Testing"}, {"text": "In addition to the development of these testing schemes, which will get a more permanent shape and place in the future GMI network, GMI plans to design in silico pilots using realistic scenarios based on and using data from a previous infectious disease outbreak or another event (http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/Newsand-Events/Previous-meetings/7th-Meeting-on-GMI). The goal of these pilots will be to help shape the process and the form that the GMI tools take, develop training skills and increase the participation level. In particular, this would be important to increase the participation level of members that currently lack the necessary laboratory capacity including members from many developing countries. These pilots will address several important issues and may help answer some important questions such as: How well does data transfer work? How well does data analysis, including species identification and outbreak clustering, work? What are the biggest challenges for coordinating an analysis that is highly dependent on metadata? What are the minimum standards required to run the system? And finally, what might be the gain in turn-around time?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality Assurance and Testing"}, {"text": "Several already existing internet-based genomic tools and databases have been presented and discussed at GMI global meetings-all of which are generally aimed at improving (inter)national detection and identification of different types of microorganisms. For instance, the global programme PulseNet compares the PFGE 'DNA fingerprints' of bacteria from patients to find clusters of disease that might represent unrecognized outbreaks (http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/). MLSTnet can be used to compare various bacteria on the basis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis (http://www.mlst.net/). EuPathDB (http://eupathdb.org/ eupathdb/) and ZoopNet [34] are portals for accessing genomic-scale and MLST datasets, respectively, which are associated with eukaryotic parasites. And NoroNet is a network of public health institutes and universities sharing virological, epidemiological and molecular data on norovirus and includes a tool for Norovirus identification and epidemiology on the basis of sequence comparison (http://www.rivm.nl/en/Topics/N/NoroNet). In contrast to GMI these earlier networks had to focus their effort on a single technique and often a limited group of microorganisms to make comparisons possible. With the arrival of cost-effective NGS and WGS this is no longer necessary; the different microbiological fields may now work together and different WGS analytical tools can be exchanged to maximize efficiency. Many of these earlier networks are now trying to make the move from traditional techniques to NGS. For example, PulseNet investigates how to use WGS and potentially metagenomics to replace PFGE and thus have a culture independent and faster technique (see: http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/nextgeneration.html). In such transitions it is important to implement new techniques in a way such that the old and new techniques are comparable and no data are lost.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Remarks"}, {"text": "GMI is an initiative open to anyone interested and many of the people associated with the networks summarized above have actually participated in the initiation and development of GMI.
