The superior performance of PCR for these 7 viruses is well known, with sensitivity of IF in symptomatic children of 63^70% (28) . IF for ADV is known to be insensitive (15^30% in symptomatic children [28] ), and 0 of 10 PCR-positive samples in the current study were detected by IF.

Seven episodes in HSCT recipients were fatal, with LRTI the principle cause of death in 5 episodes. All deaths from LRTI followed nosocomial RV infection.NTS collected during episodes of URTI were more likely to have RV detected by IF or PCR than those during LRTI episodes (41/117, 35%, and 46/194, 23.7%, respectively, P 5 0.03, OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.04^2.10). During episodes of LRTI, the proportion of samples with RVdetected was similar for NTS and BAL specimens (46/194, 23.7%, and 11/40, 27.5%, respectively, P 5 0.6). detection in nose and throat swabs collected from hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, strati\u00a2ed by clinical screening scores and presence of respiratory tract infection (RTI) (n 5 498)Following the introduction of the CS tool, collection of NTS from all hematology patients increased 4 -fold (293 in years 2002^2004, 1220 in years 2005^2007, Po0.0001).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical screening scores compared with combined viral immuno\u00a3uorescence and polymerase chain reaction results in nose and throat swab samples collected from all hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, and during admission HSCT was received", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Ferguson et al: Respiratory virus detection tool in HSCT", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Post-test probability of respiratory virus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients using the clinical screening score at di\u00a1erent prevalence rates, and number needed to test for a positive result", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Threshold score </td><td> 1 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Threshold score </td><td> 2\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td> 1 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td> 2 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0^1\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-test probability (prevalence)\nPost-test probability\n</td><td>Number needed to test for positive result\n</td><td>Post-test probability\n</td><td>Number needed to test for positive result\n</td><td>Post-test probability\n</td><td>Number needed to test for positive result\n</td><td>Post-test probability\n</td><td>Number needed to test for positive result\n</td></tr><tr><td>22% </td><td>26 (23^30) </td><td>3.8 (3.3^4.3) </td><td>11 (5^20) </td><td>9.1 (5^20) </td><td>29 (23^35) </td><td>3.4 (2.9^4.3) </td><td>15 (11^22) </td><td>6 (4.5^9.1)\n</td></tr><tr><td>10% </td><td>13 (12^14) </td><td>7.7 (7.1^8.3) </td><td>5 (3^7) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>20 (14.3^33.3) 14 (12^16) </td><td>7.1 (6.3^8.3) </td><td>7 (5^9) </td><td>14 (12^16)\n</td></tr><tr><td>35% </td><td>41 (39^43) </td><td>2.4 (2.3^2.6) </td><td>19 (15^23) </td><td>5.3 (4.3^6.7) </td><td>44 (41^47) </td><td>2.3 (2.1^2.4) </td><td>26 (23^29) </td><td>3.8 (3.4^4.3)\n</td></tr><tr><td>50% </td><td>57 (55^58) </td><td>1.8 (1.7^1.8) </td><td>30 (25^35) </td><td>3.3 (2.9^4) </td><td>59 (56^62) </td><td>1.7 (1.6^1.8) </td><td>40 (37^43) </td><td>2.5 (2.3^2.7)\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Ferguson et al: Respiratory virus detection tool in HSCT Diagnostic accuracy of immuno\u00a3uorescence (IF) testing compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by respiratory virus tested, those detectable by IF, and any positive result (all available samples, CI, con\u00a2dence interval; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; PIV, parain\u00a3uenza virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; NA, not applicable.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Ferguson et al: Respiratory virus detection tool in HSCT Transplant Infectious Disease 2011: 13: 448^455", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgements:"}]}
