            "text": "In a hypoglycaemic state, glucagon and adrenaline levels rise within minutes to facilitate a transient increase in glucose production (Cryer 2004). Hypoglycaemia causes the hypothalamus to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to release adrenaline from the adrenal glands. Adrenaline acts quickly to limit further secretion of insulin and increase secretion of glucagon. Glucagon, which is secreted from the \u03b1 cells of the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in increased glucose production from hepatic cells (Koenig 2015). Glucagon inhibits glucose uptake by peripheral tissues and stimulates the release of gluconeogenic precursors (Guyton & Hall 2006). However, the effects of glucagon are temporary and are quickly suppressed by increasing levels of insulin. Cortisol and growth hormone are released more slowly, typically a few hours following the onset of hypoglycaemia. Cortisol increases the rate of lipolysis and release of amino acids from muscle that also facilitate gluconeogenesis. Growth hormone works synergistically by decreasing utilisation of glucose by peripheral tissues as well as promoting lipolysis (Guyton & Hall 2006). A study examining these mechanisms in adrenalectomised dogs concluded that even when counter\u2010regulatory hormones are absent, the body can utilise glucose auto\u2010regulation and increased neural efferent signalling in order to stimulate hepatic production of glucose (Gregory et al. 2017). There is also evidence that central excitatory amino acids may also contribute to the maintenance of euglycaemia via activation of N\u2010methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartate receptors and subsequent stimulation of the sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary adrenal axis (Molina & Abumrad 2001). In addition to increases in concentrations in plasma concentrations of counter\u2010regulatory hormones, there is evidence of increases in concentrations of immunoreactive \u03b2\u2010endorphins, adrenocorticotropin and cortisol within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in response to hypoglycaemia. However, the significance of these alterations in CSF concentrations remains unknown (Radosevich et al. 1988).",

            "text": "Clinical signs of hypoglycaemia can manifest as cerebral dysfunction and include altered mental status, behavioural changes, weakness, ataxia, collapse, blindness or altered vision, seizures, stupor and coma. Clinical signs frequently reported in hypoglycaemic dogs and cats include anxiety, pacing, vocalisation, trembling, vomiting, tachypnoea and diarrhoea (Greene & Bright 2008, Koenig & Verlander 2015). Hypoglycaemia is typically defined as a glucose level of less than 3\u22193 mmol/L (Cryer 2012, Koenig & Verlander 2015). The severity of clinical signs typically depends on the duration of hypoglycaemic episode and the rate of decrease of glucose levels. In human patients with chronic hypoglycaemia, clinical signs may be minimal or absent until glucose levels are profoundly decreased, as a result of hypoglycaemic unawareness. The pathophysiology of hypoglycaemic unawareness is not fully understood but is thought to occur in patients whose brains have been conditioned to automatically upregulate cerebral glucose uptake as a result of prolonged, chronic or recurrent hypoglycaemia. This automatic mechanism of cerebral glucose uptake can actually lead to a decreased perception of peripheral hypoglycaemia and blunting of the body's counter\u2010regulatory responses (Weinstock et al. 2016). While there is little evidence that this occurs in companion animals, it is important to keep in mind when evaluating patients with conditions that may place them at risk for chronic hypoglycaemia, including chronic insulin overdose of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and insulinomas.",

            "text": "The brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of hypoglycaemia because it cannot manufacture its own glucose and is dependent on the constant availability of adequate amounts of glucose for energy (Boyle 1997). While it may briefly utilise ketones, the brain has a limited ability to utilise other forms of energy (Boyle 1997). In order to keep up with the brain's needs, glucose is continuously transported across the blood brain barrier from the peripheral bloodstream via facilitated transport. Glucosensors within the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, intestinal tract, carotid body and hepatoportal area act to control the amount of glucose that is transported through the blood brain barrier (Loose et al. 2008). If arterial glucose levels fall, the diffusion gradient cannot be adequately maintained and neuroglycopenia may transpire. Prolonged neuroglycopenia can lead to permanent brain injury and neurologic signs that may persist beyond resolution of the hypoglycaemia (Kraje 2003, Loose et al. 2008). While transient hypoglycaemic episodes do not typically cause damage or persistent neurologic deficits, severe or repeated hypoglycaemic states can result in neurologic deficits that may resemble other acute neurological disease processes. This syndrome is referred to as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy (Witsch et al. 2012). The prognosis for human patients is variable and ranges from reversible neurologic deficits (Aoki et al. 2004, Bottcher et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2007, Maruya et al. 2007) to persistent neurologic deficits, persistent vegetative state and death (Mori et al. 2006, Ma et al. 2009, Kang et al. 2010, Yaffe et al. 2013, Mehta et al. 2016). In veterinary literature, a case report of a dog with hypoglycaemia secondary to insulinoma and refractory epilpesy has been described in which brain lesions within the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were identified post mortem (Shimada et al. 2000).",

Bradycardia and circulatory collapse have also been documented in veterinary patients (Little 2005). The occurrence of these arrhythmias has led to concern that hypoglycaemic states may be pro\u2010arrhythmogenic (Sanon et al. 2014). While hypoglycaemia commonly will lead to the release of catecholamines and secondary tachyarrhythmias, the cause of bradyarrhythmias is unknown.",

Although the gold standard for the measurement of blood glucose is analysis by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, this is not available in a clinical setting (Tonyushkina & Nichols 2009). Therefore, most glucose levels are measured with handheld point\u2010of\u2010care glucometers (POCG). POCGs that are typically designed for humans can demonstrate inconsistencies regarding accuracy in veterinary species (Cohen et al. 2009). Other POCGs marketed to veterinarians utilise internal algorithms that attempt to quantify species differences between free and haemoglobin\u2010bound glucose (Zini et al. 2009). The accuracy of handheld glucometers can be vulnerable to delays in separation of the serum from the red blood cells longer that 30 minutes after collection, leading to pseudohypoglycaemia as a result of continued consumption of glucose by the red blood cells in vitro (Koenig & Verlander 2015). This effect can be prevented by collecting blood samples in sodium fluoride tubes if they cannot be processed via centrifugation within that time period. Haemodilution and haemoconcentration can also affect the accuracy of glucose readings (Solnica et al. 2012). The mechanism behind this is believed to be a result of a reduction of the volume of plasma due to the presence of increased erythrocytes in a haemoconcentrated sample. This causes the volume of plasma that is able to penetrate the reagent layer to be reduced, resulting in a falsely reduced glucose measurement (Tang et al. 2000). Conversely, a haemodiluted sample allows an abnormally large amount of plasma to contact the test strip reagent layer, which falsely elevates the glucose measurement (Tang et al. 2000). Lane et al. (2015) proposed a formula to correct the glucose level given a known packed cell volume, but additional algorithms would need to be developed and validated for other glucometer models.",

The sensor is comprised of a glucose diffusion limiting membrane which contains glucose oxidase. When the membrane is exposed to glucose in the presence of oxygen, it undergoes an oxidation reaction to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide creates a current that reflects the glucose level within the interstitium via a reaction with the platinum electrode (Reineke et al. 2010). Over the last 10 years, studies in experimental non\u2010diabetic dogs, stable diabetic dogs and cats and those with diabetic ketoacidosis have, for the most part, demonstrated accuracy and agreement between glucose values obtained via CGMS compared with those obtained via traditional glucometers (Davison et al. 2003, Ristic et al. 2005, Wiedmeyer et al. 2005, Reineke et al. 2010).",

Furthermore, obese animals and cats that regularly received more than 6 units of insulin per injection were at increased risk (Whitley et al. 1997). Diabetic animals that are experiencing gastrointestinal upset secondary to concurrent underlying illness were also reported to be at increased risk for experiencing hypoglycaemia secondary to concurrent administration of exogenous insulin (Whitley et al. 1997).

Abdominal ultrasound has low sensitivity to detect these tumours and, in some cases, CT or abdominal exploratory is recommended for definitive identification (Robben et al. 2005). Medical treatment options include stabilisation of refractory and life\u2010threatening hypoglycaemia via administration of glucagon continuous infusions if indicated, frequent feeding and oral administration of glucocorticoids as well as other adjunctive medications such as diazoxide and somatostatin therapy to help alleviate clinical signs and maintain normoglycaemia. Both diazoxide and somatostatin result in membrane hyperpolarisation and inhibition of normal insulin release (Dunne & Peterson 1991). Diazoxide may increase hepatic glucose production and reduce peripheral glucose uptake (Altszuler et al. 1977). Somatostatin has inhibitory effects on several other hormones including glucagon, secretin and vasoactive inhibitory peptide. Somatostatin analogues like octreotide are used more commonly due to their longer half\u2010life (Lamberts et al. 1996). Octreotide has been evaluated in healthy dogs and dogs with insulinomas (Robben et al. 2006): following administration, plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations decreased in healthy dogs but only insulin decreased in dogs with insulinomas. None of the dogs experienced significant adverse effects from the medication. Evaluation of somatostatin receptors in canine insulinomas revealed that dogs only express one type of somatostatin receptor, in contrast to humans who can express several types (Robben et al. 1997). This can make it difficult to extrapolate information from human studies of somatostatin use in insulinomas to canine patients. There have been rare reports of insulinomas diagnosed in cats (McMillan et al. 1985, Hawks et al. 1992, Elie & Zerbe 1995, Kraje 2003, Greene & Bright 2008), but there are no reports of using somatostatins or diazoxide in cats.

Ferrets can be treated in a similar way to dogs and glucocorticoids may aid in maintaining normoglycaemia. The recommended oral starting dose of 0\u221925 mg/kg prednisone is every 24 hours, which can then be titrated as needed (Melano & Peterson 2013). Diazoxide can also be prescribed, but this medication can be cost\u2010prohibitive.

Once ingested, peak plasma levels of xylitol in dogs are reached within 30 minutes. The majority of xylitol is metabolised in the liver and transformed to d\u2010xylulose, which then becomes d\u2010xylulose\u20105\u2010phosphate (Froesch & Jakob 1974, Piscitelli et al. 2010). Xylitol is then converted to glucose, glycogen or lactate via the pentose phosphate pathway (Piscitelli et al. 2010). Unlike humans, dogs experience a marked dose\u2010dependent insulin surge following xylitol ingestion, leading to hypoglycaemia (Xia et al. 2009). Hepatic failure in dogs secondary to xylitol has also been described (Dunayer & Gwaltney\u2010Brant 2006, Todd & Powell 2007). A recent retrospective article found the most common clinical signs associated with xylitol ingestion in dogs were vomiting and lethargy, and 15% of dogs became hypoglycaemic during hospitalisation (DuHadway et al. 2015). None of the dogs developed hepatic failure and all survived to discharge. Historically, 0\u22191 g/kg is the minimal dose believed to result in hypoglycaemia, while dogs ingesting 0\u22195 g/kg or greater are believed to be at increased risk of developing acute liver failure (Dunayer & Gwaltney\u2010Brant 2006). There is also evidence that the development of hypoglycaemia and, especially, acute liver failure may be idiosyncratic rather than strictly dose\u2010dependent, because previous cases series have documented dogs recovering after ingesting up to 16 g/kg of xylitol, while other dogs have died after ingesting far lower doses (Dunayer & Gwaltney\u2010Brant 2006).

The oxidation of ethanol raises levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH), which then inhibits enzymes that regulate gluconeogenesis, leading to a decreased ability to release glucose from the liver (Kandi et al. 2014). The most common types of alcohols encountered include methanol, ethanol and isopropanol (also known as rubbing alcohol). Previous case reports of poisoning from exposure to ethanol in veterinary medicine have included alcoholic beverages (Ratclife & Zuber 1977, Houston & Head 1993, Keno & Langston 2011), various types of uncooked dough (Thrall et al. 1984, Suter 1992, Means 2003) and uncooked apples (Kammerer et al. 2001).

It has been utilised in veterinary medicine by alternative medicine practitioners as a potential therapy for patients with DM and cognitive dysfunction in dogs (Means 2008). The reported therapeutic dose in cats is 1 to 5 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 25 mg/day, and up to 80 to 200 mg/day in dogs. However, due to limited information on safety, its use in veterinary medicine remains controversial. However, ALA has been reported to be a concerning potential toxicity in companion animals. There are three existing case reports of toxicity in dogs (Means 2008, Loftin & Herold 2009), and ALA has been noted to be 10 times more toxic in cats as compared to dogs, humans and rats (Hill et al. 2004). Cats with ALA toxicity have been noted to exhibit anorexia, ataxia, hypersalivation, vomiting and elevated hepatic enzymes with single doses of 60 mg/kg (Loftin & Herold 2009). Dogs can exhibit similar signs as well as hypoglycaemia, hepatic and renal failure (Loftin & Herold 2009). Proposed mechanisms for hypoglycaemia include increased uptake of glucose, increased number of glucose transport proteins and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, among others (Jacob et al. 1999, Loftin & Herold 2009).",

Other causes of hypoglycaemia were excluded and the patient recovered with supportive care (Page & Murtaugh 2015). Nerium oleander is a flowering shrub in the family Apocyanaceae, and all parts of the plant contain cardenolides, which are cardiac glycosides (Langford & Boor 1996). Proposed mechanisms of action regarding oleander's ability to cause hypoglycaemia include disruption of the sodium gradient necessary for the transport of glucose via disruption of the Na/K ATPase pump, or inhibition of \u03b1\u2010glucosidases within the small intestine responsible for hydrolysing saccharides to glucose (Mwafy & Yassin 2011, Page & Murtaugh 2015).",

Other factors that may predispose neonatal patients to the development of hypoglycaemia include decreased birth weight, premature birth and being born to a bitch with systemic illness or diabetes. There is some evidence to support neonatal hypoglycaemia as a predictor of higher mortality between 1 and 21 days of age (Mila et al. 2017). Once weaned, paediatric patients can experience hypoglycaemia secondary to concurrent infections, immune system stimulation, exercise, decreased quality of nutrition, hypothermia, ongoing gastrointestinal losses and fasting (McMichael 2015). Parvovirus is one of the most common causes of hypoglycaemia in young animals. A study by Castro et al. (2013) evaluating puppies with either coronavirus or parvovirus showed that both groups commonly experienced hypoglycaemia, although they did not evaluate whether hypoglycaemia was a prognostic factor. In cats with parvovirus (feline panleukopenia virus), hypoglycaemia was much less common and not associated with prognosis (Kruse et al. 2010). A 2017 article comparing inpatient versus outpatient treatment protocols found that 50% of the outpatient group required dextrose supplementation, while 80% of the inpatient group required dextrose supplementation (Venn et al. 2017).",

Despite beginning with 24% of resting energy requirement on day 1 of hospitalisation, it developed hypoglycaemia 12 hours after refeeding was initiated and required supplementation via a dextrose constant\u2010rate infusion. The cat went on to make a full recovery and theories regarding the cause of hypoglycaemia included reduced glycogen stores, depleted body fat secondary to starvation and exacerbation of inappropriate release of insulin secondary to dextrose supplementation (DeAvilla & Leech 2016).",

Increases in anaerobic glycolysis secondary to upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor and other cytokines may be exacerbated by hypotension or hypoxia, further driving excess glucose consumption. Although glucose can aid diagnosis of sepsis in patients with septic effusion, it may not be as helpful in those without effusion (Koenig & Verlander 2015). Other studies have found no significant difference in glucose between septic and non\u2010septic dogs and no difference when comparing glucose in survivors versus non\u2010survivors with sepsis (Hauptman et al. 1997). Interestingly, in a recent retrospective evaluating septic cats, hypoglycaemia was not commonly seen or associated with outcome (Brady et al. 2000).

            "text": "Babesia is an example of a specific infection in which 20% of infected patients are hypoglycaemic. Similar to sepsis, hypoglycaemia is associated with consumption of glucose by the parasite, depletion of hepatic stores or hepatic dysfunction, increased anaerobic glycolysis and hyperinsulinaemia (Rees & Schoeman 2010, Keller et al. 2004). A prospective study examining the pituitary\u2013adrenal and pituitary\u2010thyroid axes in dogs with babesiosis found elevations in basal and post ACTH serum cortisol concentrations as well as decreases in body temperature, serum thyroxine and free thyroxine in those patients with hypoglycaemia, suggesting that adrenal insufficiency was not responsible for the alterations in glucose levels and that adrenal and thyroidal hormones respond differently to hypoglycaemia (Schoeman & Herrtage 2007). Some studies have reported that hypoglycaemia may be associated with more pathologic strains of babesia and that hypoglycaemia at presentation is a poor prognostic indicator (Keller et al. 2004, Jacobson & Lobetti 2005, Ayoob et al. 2010). According to one study, risk factors associated with the development of hypoglycaemia in dogs with babesia included collapsed state, youth, severe anaemia, vomiting and icterus (Keller et al. 2004). Other parasitic infections also have the potential to cause hypoglycaemia in their hosts. A recent case report from France (Deschamps et al. 2016) details refractory hypoglycaemia in a 2\u2010year\u2010old female intact mixed breed dog infected with Trypanosoma congolense. The primary presenting complaint was seizure activity secondary to persistent hypoglycaemia. Trypanosomes were visible in a routine blood smear and infection was confirmed by PCR. The infection responded to therapy with intramuscular injections of pentamidine at 48\u2010hour intervals, the hypoglycaemia initially failed to improve despite aggressive therapy that included both intravenous supplementation of 30% glucose and administration of 70% sucrose via feeding tube. The authors speculated that glucose administration may have served as a food source for the trypanosomes as potential explanation for the persistent hypoglycaemia. A previous case report of a 6\u2010year\u2010old male intact dog with trypanosomiasis also documented a profound hypoglycaemia (Gunaseelan et al. 2009).",

Hepatic diseases such as hepatitis, hepatic lipidosis, hepatic neoplasia, cirrhosis, portosystemic shunt, glycogen storage disease and hepatotoxins can all induce hepatic dysfunction (Walton 2002). Even if there is hepatic dysfunction, hypoglycaemia does not occur until more than 70% of hepatic function is lost (Center et al. 1996). Once there is depletion of glycogen stores, the body utilises protein catabolism to supply amino acids from gluconeogenesis (Weingarten & Sande 2015). A study by Lester et al. (2016) evaluating dogs with acute liver failure from multiple aetiologies revealed that on presentation, 20% of these patients were hypoglycaemic. Studies evaluating feline hepatic failure are sparse but in an evaluation of seven cats with benzodiazepine\u2010associated liver failure, three were hypoglycaemic but the remaining four had blood glucose levels at the lower end of the reference interval (Hughes et al. 1996).",

The percentage of dogs that go on to develop symptomatic neuroglycopenia, including seizures, appears to be quite low (Levy 1994, Melian & Peterson 1996). Apart from hypoglycaemia, other clinicopathologic abnormalities that may be noted included azotaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, hypochloraemia and the absence of a stress leukogram (Syme & Scott\u2010Moncrieff 1998, Feldman & Nelson 2004). Clinical signs may include gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia in addition to polyuria, polydipsia, bradycardia and dehydration (Feldman & Nelson 2004). Animals may be asymptomatic until confronted with the stress of concurrent illness or other physical sources of stress, including anaesthetic episodes (Lane et al. 1999).

Complications of intravenous dextrose include phlebitis secondary to its hypertonicity and so placement of a central line is recommended for administration of dextrose solutions with concentrations greater than 5%. Additional complications of dextrose administration include rebound hypoglycaemia, as the influx of dextrose can cause pancreatic \u03b2 cells to release insulin in response to the acute hyperglycaemia and may induce recurrence of hypoglycaemia (Goutal et al. 2012). Rebound hypoglycaemia is particularly a risk during treatment of insulinomas, prompting recommendations to avoid aggressive dextrose bolusing in favour of small frequent meals and medical management, as discussed previously (Table 2).",

In cases of hypoglycaemia that are refractory to dextrose administration, glucagon is also utilised as a therapy in human and veterinary medicine. In a recent retrospective study of nine dogs with hypoglycaemia due to a variety of causes including insulinoma and atypical hypoadrenocorticism, all patients demonstrated a statistically significant increase in blood glucose with administration of glucagon infusions compared to levels at intake (Datte et al. 2016). The only adverse effect reported in this study attributable to glucagon was mild hyperglycaemia. A recent prospective study by Zeugswetter et al. (2012) investigated the potential for use of sc glucagon as part of an emergency kit intended for patients with DM that experience hypoglycaemic crises. The authors administered 1 mg synthetic glucagon intravenously in one group of healthy beagles and sc in another group. After treatment the levels of insulin\u2010like immunoreactivity (Insulin\u2010imr), glucose, ACTH and cortisol were compared between the two groups. The authors concluded that sc glucagon did increase the glucose and Insulin\u2010imr levels, with peak glucose concentrations reached in 20 minutes. Administration of sc glucagon did not increase cortisol or ACTH levels. Although the peak concentration in the sc glucagon group was lower than those reached in the intravenous group, the authors concluded that it could potentially be beneficial in the initial at\u2010home treatment of hypoglycaemic crises in dogs with DM, although it would not be useful in the treatment of animals with suspect hypocortisolism (Zeugswetter et al. 2012). Apart from mild sedation, no other potential adverse effects were observed (Graf et al. 1999, Fall et al. 2008).",

Advances in at\u2010home monitoring for patients with DM in the form of CGMS and potential future development of sc glucagon emergency kits may help owners to recognise hypoglycaemic events in the early stages and provide initial therapy before the episode becomes prolonged. Additional novel methods of early detection that may one day be extrapolated from human medicine include development of a method to analyse breath samples to detect the presence of volatile organic compounds which may signal hypoglycaemia in patients with DM (Siegel et al. 2017).",
