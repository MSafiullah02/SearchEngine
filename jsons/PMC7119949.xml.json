Its basic concept is to automatically divide the huge computing processing program into numerous smaller subroutines through the network, and then hand the processing results back to the user after searching, calculating and analyzing by a large system of multiple servers [4\u20136]. With this technology, web service providers can process tens of millions, if not billions, of information in a matter of seconds, reaching a network service as powerful as a supercomputer [7, 8]. Cloud computing is a resource delivery and usage model, it means get resource (Hardware, software) via network. The network of providing resource is called \u2018Cloud\u2019. The hardware resource in the \u2018Cloud\u2019 seems scalable infinitely and can be used whenever [9\u201311].",
