The genomic information thus obtained so far and two other technologies in particular, DNA microarray and mass spectrometry, have largely helped advancing the analyses of transcriptome and proteome. In contrast, biochemical analysis of proteins has been hampered mainly because the traditional protein analysis methods are low\u2010throughput in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a high\u2010throughput analytical tool, one analogous to the DNA microarray, for proteins. In the post\u2010genomic era, the protein microarray is particularly promising in elucidating the biochemical properties of a large number of gene products [2]. Since the proteins found in a genome will have a wide variety of biochemical properties, it would be very useful to have several methodologies for making protein arrays.",

However, this method is yet to become a commonly used biochemical tool for the analysis of proteins [4]. Certainly there are rooms for further improvement before this technology could become a routinely used laboratory tool. For example, one of the problems is the difficulty in immobilizing a variety of proteins in their functionally active forms. Many proteins needed to be appropriately oriented for proper functioning [2]. However, it is not easy to control the orientation of the protein during its mobilization on the surface of the microplate. Another problem is that the high\u2010throughput functional analysis requires freshly produced and purified proteins; however, unlike DNA, many purified proteins are not stable and thus, cannot be stored in active condition for long time. The development of functional protein microarrays for practical use, therefore, requires relatively easy methods for the functional immobilization and purification of freshly prepared proteins on the microplate. We recently developed a high\u2010throughput method for protein synthesis using the wheat germ cell\u2010free protein synthesis and an automatic protein synthesizer [5, 6, 7], and demonstrated that the automatic synthesizer is very useful for the production of freshly prepared proteins.",

For example, chemically synthesized or modified DNAs have been widely used in DNA sequencing, PCR amplification and DNA microarrays. This inspired us to apply the DNA technology to comprehensive protein analysis. Several types of conserved DNA\u2010binding domains have been found in transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors. One of them is the bZIP domain. As described previously, the Arabidopsis HY5 transcription factor having a bZIP domain was synthesized in good quality and quantity in the wheat germ cell\u2010free system [5]. We thus examined whether the synthesized HY5 protein could bind to a DNA\u2010conjugated column purchased from a commercial source. Interestingly, the HY5 protein bound to the column and was eluted at a high salt concentration (500 mM) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the eluted protein appeared as the major band on a SDS\u2013PAGE because most of the endogenous proteins in the mixture were washed out with a 200 mM salt solution. This suggested the possibility of using this DNA\u2010binding tag to purity recombinant proteins. We also found that, among 35 human nuclear hormone receptors tested, only HY5 bound to and was recovered from the DNA\u2010conjugated column (data not shown). Since the HY5 bound to a microsatellite sequence (CA or CAA repeat) that is the highest repeat sequence in eukaryotic genome, microsatellite\u2010binding protein may function as DNA\u2010binding tag.",

Among them, microarrays are especially powerful tools because they are economic, and also because of the speed by which they could be used to interpret gene functions [2]. In the process of developing a protein microarray, we designed a new microplate that carries a thin layer of agarose gel containing DNA (agarose/DNA microplate) to immobilize and purify the DBtagged proteins on the microplate (Fig. 2\nA). We hypothesized that a DBtag\u2010fusion protein would be immobilized on the agarose/DNA microplate and the other proteins would washed out. To test our hypothesis, we fused 6\u00d7 histidine, GST, streptavidin, and DBtag to the N\u2010terminal end of GFP to produce His\u2010GFP, GST\u2010GFP, STA\u2010GFP, and DBtag\u2010GFP, respectively. Those tagged GFPs were then spotted in an array on an agaraose/DNA microplate. Consistent with our hypothesis, subsequent washing of the plate removed all the spots except those of the DBtag\u2010GFP (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence from the red fluorescence protein (RFP), which was used as a marker endogenous protein, was found to be diffused, and was removed by washing (Fig. 2C). This result suggested that the endogenous proteins from the cell\u2010free system would most likely wash out. Also the DBtag can immobilize the GFP fusion even by treatment of high\u2010concentration detergent buffer (5% Tween\u201020 or 5% NP\u201040) (Fig. 2D). Quantification of the DBtag\u2010GFP spots after wash revealed that 25 \u00b1 8% (average \u00b1 S.D.) of spotted DBtag\u2010GFP remained immobilized on the microplate. This indicates that approximately 160 pg of DBtag\u2010GFP was immobilized, which compares favorably to existing method [2]. The concentration of the DBtag\u2010GFP in the spot was calculated as16 pg/nl (see Section 2.6). This result suggested that the DBtagged proteins could be immobilized and purified on the microplate.",

The activity of most of the protein kinases tested was inhibited by staurosporine at a high concentration (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels). MST2 was especially sensitive to the staurosporine treatment and its activity drastically decreased to less than 2% of the control value by treatment with 0.1 \u03bcM staurosporine (Fig. 3, middle panel). The activities of PAK3 and DAPK3 were inhibited by 70% and 80%, respectively, when treated with 0.1 \u03bcM staurosporine, and by 97% and 98%, respectively, when treated with 1 \u03bcM staurosporine. Eight out of the 11 human protein kinases were inhibited by staurosporine in this microarray assay. However, staurosporine did not inhibit the kinase activities of CK1g3, CK2a1, and TTK in our assay. Non\u2010inhibition of CK1 and CK2 was reasonable because inhibition of CK1 and CK2 by staurosporine was reported as 163.5 \u03bcM and 19.5 \u03bcM of IC50, respectively [25]. To our knowledge about inhibition of TTK by staurosporine, this is the first report. Our study suggested low sensitivity of TTK to staurosporine. Also staurosporine inhibition from non\u2010tag form proteins synthesized by the cell\u2010free system indicated the similar data (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that our newly designed protein microarray could not only immobilize proteins in active forms but could also be used as a platform for designing assays for inhibitor screening.",

For this assay, we used fluorescence\u2010labeled proteins as substrates, which had been immobilized on the microplate. A TEV protease recognition site was inserted between the DBtag and biotin ligation site (bls) of these test proteins. The substrate proteins were fluorescence\u2010labeled by co\u2010translationally biotinylating them in the cell\u2010free protein synthesis and then adding Alexa488\u2010STA to bind with the biotin (schematically shown in Fig. 4\nA). The labeled proteins and non\u2010biotinylated proteins (negative controls) were mixed with Alexa488\u2010STA and then the mixture was spotted in an array on a microplate. When the plate was washed, fluorescence of the non\u2010biotinylated proteins disappeared, which indicated that only biotinylated proteins were labeled with fluorescence (Fig. 4B, middle panel). When incubated with the TEV protease, the proteins having the TEV protease cleavage sites lost fluorescence, while the protein having other protease cleavage sites retained fluorescence (Fig. 4B, lower panel). We next used the approach for detection of caspase\u20103 (casp3) cleavage. The casp3, a key protease in apoptosis event, activates PAK2 protein kinase by cleavage [26]. Like above substrate proteins, the PAK2 was labeled with the DBtag and the biotin on bls in N and C\u2010terminals respectively (DBtag\u2010PAK2\u2010bls) and spotted with Alexa488\u2010STA on the microplate. The microplate was incubated with casp3 and washed. Like the assay of TEV protease above, fluorescence of DBtag\u2010PAK2\u2010bls lost (Fig. 4C, middle panel), while DBtag\u2010bls (negative control) or buffer without casp3 retained fluorescence (middle and lower panels). By Western blotting, the cleavage of DBtag\u2010PAK2\u2010bls by casp3 was confirmed (data not shown). Thus the lost of fluorescence indicated the cleavage of the PAK2. The data showed that the DBtag\u2010protein\u2010bls could function as a good material for substrate screening of protease. Thus these results suggested that this microarray system could also be used for screening substrate proteins that are specifically cleaved by proteases.",

High\u2010throughput protein production is a key issue for making the protein microarray. Although the existing methods using the microarray have mainly used the cell\u2010based method such as yeast or E. coli cells [2, 3, 4], a large number of protein productions by the cell\u2010based method will definitely be of substantial works. Recently, the cell\u2010free protein production system using extracts from the wheat germ or E. coli cells has been used for high\u2010throughput synthesis of proteins because of the simple and effective methodology (see the review [6]). Furthermore, a fully automated robot based on the wheat cell\u2010free system, shown in this paper, could operate a considerable number of protein productions. In addition, the biotin\u2010labeled protein was used for detection of the protein\u2013protein interaction and the cleavage of substrate proteins. Like the biotin labeling with the tag, the reconstruction of protein design allows wide range applications for the microarray\u2010based functional analysis. However, using the cell\u2010based methods, the time\u2010consuming steps such as new vector construction are needed with every redesign of protein. In contrast the cell\u2010free system accepts a linearly\u2010rearranged DNA template produced by the PCR method without the new vector construction, indicating no requirement of the time\u2010consuming steps. Thus, the cell\u2010free system seems to be especially suitable as a protein production method for the microarray\u2010based functional analysis.",

On the other hand, columns or beads traditionally used for protein purification have been widely used for functional assays like a pull\u2010down assay, because they could preserve a three\u2010dimensional space for proteins to react with molecules. Here, we explored a way to purify proteins on the microplate by mildly holding the freshly synthesized proteins in a three\u2010dimensional space. This led to a protein microarray design in which the agarose gel formed a scaffold housing the DNAs (DNA\u2013agarose matrix), which in turn were used for immobilizing the DBtagged proteins. This design was analogous to a flexible framework known as the nuclear matrix inside the nuclei [31]. The DNA framework in the agarose gel on a microplate was expected to keep a space around the immobilized proteins in the same way as the columns and beads do. Being a polymer, agarose could also insulate the freshly prepared proteins from the air, which we believe is important for the preservation of protein activity.",

Other proteins, having the cleavage site of SARS virus protease (SAcs), showed fluorescence (spots indicated in light blue) because they were not recognized by the TEV as substrates. (C) DBtag\u2010bls indicates DBtag\u2010TEVcs\u2010bls above. Two proteins including PAK2 (lower spot in each panel: DBtag\u2010PAK2\u2010bls labeled with Alexa488\u2010STA) lost the fluorescence after the caspase 3 (casp3) treatment (\u201cCasp3\u201d panel). DBtag\u2010bls proteins (upper spot in each panel: DBtag\u2010bls labeled with Alexa488\u2010STA) and buffer without the casp3 (\u201cbuffer\u201d panel) showed fluorescence because they were not recognized by the casp3 as substrates.",
