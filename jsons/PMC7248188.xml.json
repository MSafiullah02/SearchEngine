Infection is thought to occur primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the infected person speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity.

Small droplets forming an aerosol (less than ~ 10 \u03bcm) are much less prone to impaction and can remain airborne for an extended time and spread by air currents [9].

These include bronchoscopy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, and extubation but also include those using high speed devices most typically drills in orthopaedics and dentistry. The question arises as to whether vitrectomy, with blade rates up to 10,000 cycles per minute, are aerosol producing. There is no definition that we could find of high speed but it is typically used when referring to drills operating at over 50,000 CPM. Phacoemulsification or lens fragmentation is often combined with vitrectomy, where ultrasonic induced probe movement at > 50,000 Hz occurs. Again, this is typically carried out within fluid however and it is not known if either vitrectomy or ultrasonic lens disruption is associated with significant aerosol creation. Vapour is certainly visible to the naked eye when probes are tested in shallow saline outside the eye. Indeed, aerosols are only produced when an air current moves across the surface of a film of liquid. In vitrectomy, the cutter blade moves within the fluid filled vitreous cavity in an effectively closed system. Cutting is sometimes done at air/fluid interfaces; however, all fluid and air is aspirated to the machine cassette and collected in a reservoir in a closed system. If aerosol does generate in the vitreous cavity, the majority will be carried to the cassette of the vitrectomy machine. Certain make of vitrectomy machines, for example Constellation\u00ae, has integrated filters in the cassette, with aerosol filtration efficiencies of 0.2 \u03bcm, and should filter off any aerosol before it is vented into the environment (personal communication: Alcon Inc).",

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane bound protein that is the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is certainly present in the retina and has been detected in aqueous [18].
