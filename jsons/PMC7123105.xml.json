Indeed, it becomes apparent that very little exists in terms of biosecurity related education. Some exceptional existing cases could be considered as examples or models, but we are far from achieving the necessary levels of biosecurity related education for life sciences students to be able to generate a culture of responsibility (Mancini and Revill, 2008). Furthermore, there is also, in general, a lack of awareness of the risk of malevolent misuse of the biological sciences as demonstrated also by Dando and Rapper who conducted 90 interactive seminars with more than 2500 life scientists in 13 different countries (Dando and Rappert, 2005).",

Scientists often recognize the biorisks related to pathogens they are researching accidentally infecting people and animals or contaminating the environment outside the laboratories, rather than recognizing the risk of theft or intentional malicious use of bioagents for biocrime and terrorism (Gaudioso, 2006). Moreover, in her survey of Asian life scientists, Gaudioso described how the main means to manage biorisk management in laboratories are biosafety operations manual, institutional biosafety committee, biosafety training procedures, and laboratory management plan, while biosecurity issues do not figure as predominantly in most biorisk assessment, and simple biosecurity measures are utilized to protect laboratories containing pathogens or toxins (Gaudioso, 2006). Therefore, in this context, biosafety education for scientists working with highly pathogenic microorganism and toxins is based on WHO and CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) manuals and, in some cases, on national or institutional regulations. Biosafety training and dissemination of good practices are mostly responsibility of the institutes where the pathogens are used and, as it happens for biosecurity principles, they are very seldom integrated in future scientists education as topics discussed during university courses.",

The development of a sustainable knowledge was achieved by training, first, groups of local experts, i.e. National Experts (NEs), coming from the 22 participating countries, in the concepts of biosecurity, biosafety and biorisk management system and, then, by supporting the NEs, who successfully completed the training sessions and were qualified to become trainers in their own countries, in implementing the training locally addressed to second groups of local experts (hereafter referred to as \u201cNational Participants\u201d), so that NEs become trainers locally.",

This course was designed to help participants develop an in-depth understanding of facilitation techniques focused on adult training, concepts of active learning and active learning strategies for teaching bio-risk management. The training was designed to provide the attendants with the ability to distinguish among various approaches for adult training, to compare different methods for training in bio-risk management, to apply active learning methodologies in training and to distinguish among various types of assessment (Fig. 4).\n\nE-learning platform: this theoretical and practical course was aimed to make experts more familiar with the e-learning platform. It illustrated how to use the platform as a student (i.e. updating personal profile, downloading course presentations, filling and uploading assessment tests and communicating through chats and forums) and as a teacher (showing how to create new courses and profiles, upload files and grade assessment tests).\nBackground elements of Quantitative Microbial Risk and Assessment and presentation of toolkit focused on the biosafety and the biosecurity program in laboratories. To point out the synergy and potential conflicts between biosafety and biosecurity both programs were discussed in detail. The experts were provided with international guidelines (WHO, BMBL, CWA Laboratory Biorisk management) and tools like the biosecurity toolkit in order to think over biosecurity management in their own organization and to identify gaps in their biosecurity management system. The aim of this lecture was to show the importance of doing a risk assessment and how to create awareness. As an example of risk assessment, the basic steps of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) for food and water were explained: hazard identification, exposure assessment and risk characterization, including also variability and uncertainty.\n\nModule 2 \u201cLegal, ethical, environmental aspects\u201d\n\nLegal framework for Biosafety and Biosecurity was aimed to review the basic legal concepts and ideas relating to biosafety and biosecurity and legislative provisions. During the training, participants were asked not only to compare and contrast the legislative frameworks in their respective countries but also to exchange ideas on best practices and areas where further regulation may be required.\nEnvironmental Biosafety and Biosecurity focused on general environmental concepts (biodiversity, resilience, and sustainability), environmental impact assessment, and environmental management (Environmental Protection). In particular, biosafety, biosecurity and biorisk analysis, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Environment Risk Assessment (ERA), Environment Management Systems (EMS) were presented and discussed. Moreover, the Invasive Alien Species (IAS) topic was developed elucidating the principle of invasion ecology, explanation of the invasion process, and determinants of invasiveness and invisibility. It was deeply analyzed the theme of biodiversity and the importance of its protection for earth and earth inhabitants health.\nEthical/dual use aspects discussed the ethical questions related to the dual use dilemmas in science and, in particular, it focused on the possibility to use the new emerging technologies, like nanotechnology, technologies based on atomic fission, chemistry and synthetic biology, for good as well as for bad purposes. The question of the moral responsibility of scientists and on their accountability in dual use dilemmas was deepened and some case studies were discussed.\n\nModule 3 \u201cLaboratory Biorisk Management\u201d\n\nLaboratory Biorisk Management was divided in different subtopics. The first one focused on natural occurring bio emergency. In particular, the social, economical and demographical impacts of SARS outbreak (2003) were analyzed in detail. Moreover, the recent Ebola outbreak (2014) effects in society, economy and demography in the three most affected countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone) and in the rest of the word have been discussed. The second course reviewed the classification of infective microorganism by risk group, the characteristics of microorganisms belonging to different groups, the bio containment levels that have to be applied for each group and the diagnostic tools used to identify viruses and bacteria. Moreover, this course aimed to refresh and improve knowledge about safety in clinical diagnostic Biosafety Level Laboratories 2, 3 and 4 (BSL2, BSL3 and BSL4) of L. Sacco University Hospital based in Milan (Italy), to encourage laboratory workers to think over safety issues while they are working and to stimulate the birth of a safety culture in biological laboratory. Guidelines to work safely in a contained laboratory were discussed and their implementations presented in details, analysing laboratory building, personal protective equipments and good laboratory practices, as well as how to face an accident or an emergency. Experts had also the possibility to visit both the cellular and molecular laboratories of a BSL2, BSL3 and BSL4 facilities. The laboratory visit and practical exercise consisted in donning the BSL3 and BSL4 suit and all the required PPE appropriately, in getting in the BSL3 and BSL4, where laboratory workers showed equipment and tools and explained in detail how to work safely in containment laboratories, using biosafety cabinets and appropriate protocols especially for decontamination of outgoing material (Fig. 5).\n\nBiological Risk Assessment Methodologies/Measurements and analysis of biorisk management system performance were mainly the Laboratory Biorisk Management through the AMP model (Assessment, Mitigation, Performance). In particular, BioRAM, software for risk assessment developed by Sandia, and \u201cWhat if\u201d analysis, FMEA, FTA, HAZOP study were presented in detail as tools that can be used to assess biological risk correlated to a microbiological laboratory. The measures to mitigate the risk were highlighted as well, together with the methods to evaluate the performance.\n\nModule 4 \u201cAccreditation, implementation and the CWA Standards\u201d\n\nAccreditation, implementation and the CWA/ISO Standards and A wide introduction to GMOs and GMO regulations was a discussion and experience sharing among the experts from different countries. In particular, discussions focused on regulations already present in each countries, ISO, Standards and guidelines implemented and required for laboratory equipment and PPE. Moreover, Certification, Guidelines and Manuals used in Biosafety and Biorisk Management have been deeply analyzed, paying a particular attention to CWA15793 and ISO15190. The second part of this module was added to fulfil a request by the participants, emerged during module 1 and 2 attendance, and focused on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) regulations and guidelines already present in each single country for the use of GMOs.\n\n",

Through the platform, experts from different regions had the possibility to interact and confront each other on common experiences, so as to increase inter-regional cooperation and networking and the exchange of knowledge. Moreover, by making training materials available on-line before the start of intensive training courses in presence, the e-learning platform guaranteed a preliminary common ground of knowledge among all participants to the training courses in preparation for the subsequent intensive course, so as to maximize the effectiveness of training. The most important feature of the e-learning platform is that it remains available as a tool to experts, to continue using and updating it. In this way, the e-platform represents a concrete legacy of the project, which will continue to favor information sharing and will put the basis for the potential organization of further intensive courses (both theoretical and practical) ensuring, in this way, the long-term sustainability of the project, by generating further positive effects in the regions and also increasing the number of beneficiaries beyond the project\u2019s direct users.",
