Recent generations have borne the costs of HIV/AIDS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), tallied in lives and livelihoods lost and profound impacts on broader-scale economies. The most recent emergence and spread of the Zika virus and Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa demonstrate how ill prepared the world remains to respond to and control rapidly changing disease dynamics. The global panic resulting in significant financial and social consequences also illustrates the disappearing boundaries between the countries and continents working to protect their citizens. The majority of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, or those diseases caused by pathogens that are shared between people and animals (Jones et al., 2008). These diseases result in tens of thousands of deaths annually, and the economic losses from a single outbreak can amount to tens of billions of dollars (World Bank, 2012). While prevention and early control of outbreaks could be the key to reducing the impact of epidemics and potential pandemics, especially in less developed countries as demonstrated by the recent EVD epidemic in West Africa, the world still remains positioned only to respond, not to prevent.",

A growing transdisciplinary community, often led by veterinarians and epidemiologists, has responded to this knowledge gap on disease dynamics by advocating for a more holistic or One Health approach that recognizes the need to expand disciplinary expertise in public health. From the beginning of the One Health movement, veterinarians have strongly advocated for an approach that considers all public, animal, and environmental aspects of health as a problem-solving paradigm (Cook et al., 2004). Notwithstanding the philosophical acceptance of the need for such an approach, the animal and environmental foundations of this three-legged stool often receive only cursory attention when major health problems are addressed in policy and practice.",

In addition to the burden on human and animal health, the economic impacts associated with emerging and pandemic pathogens can be catastrophic, including costs associated with decreased commerce, travel, and tourism, as well as those incurred from treatment and control efforts (Karesh et al., 2012, World Bank, 2012). As our world becomes increasingly connected through trade and travel, emerging infectious diseases pose a greater threat to the global community, requiring collaboration between ministries of health and institutions involved in health, trade, agriculture, and the environment (Mazet et al., 2014). The One Health approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of emergence events and also to prevent future emergence through improved knowledge and coordination. In this article, we share One Health approaches applied by the US Agency for International Development\u2019s PREDICT project consortium to highlight the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through developing cross-sectoral networks and establishing strong collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships.",

Pioneers of the One Health concept understood the value of comparative medicine and recognized the critical role that environmental factors play in the health of people and animals. Over the past decade, this concept was expanded to be much more inclusive of ecosystem health (Cook et al., 2004), due in part to the contributions of veterinarians witnessing firsthand the intimate connection among animal, human, and environmental health (Gibbs and Gibbs, 2013). For example, although veterinarians working in global health recognize the role that wildlife trade and consumption play in human nutrition and livelihoods in many countries around the world, they have expressed concern about the risks these practices pose with regard to spillover of zoonotic pathogens, as well as to conservation (Ahuka-Mundeke et al., 2011, Karesh et al., 2005, Karesh and Noble, 2009, Peeters et al., 2002, Smith et al., 2012, Wolfe et al., 2005). Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2 are examples of pandemic infections resulting from cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from infected nonhuman primates to humans (Sharp et al., 2010). The documented spillover and pandemic potential of simian retroviruses illustrate the public health threat associated with close and frequent contact with wild animals, as occurs with wildlife trade and consumption (Switzer et al., 2012).",

Tuberculosis in nonhuman primates and Asian elephants has long been associated with contact with infected humans (Mikota and Maslow, 2011, Montali et al., 2001). Investigation into a respiratory outbreak in mountain gorillas in Rwanda by PREDICT veterinarians revealed human metapneumovirus infection in affected individuals (Palacios et al., 2011). The source of the virus remains unknown; however, the strain was most recently described in human patients in South Africa and likely was transmitted to the gorillas by humans, illustrating the potential for bi-directional spillover of pathogens (Palacios et al., 2011). The parks where mountain gorillas reside are surrounded by very dense human populations, and research and ecotourism bring thousands of people into direct and indirect contact with the gorillas annually. Veterinarians documented 18 outbreaks of respiratory disease among these gorillas between 1990 and 2010 (Spelman et al., 2013). It is unclear if the increasing frequency and severity of respiratory disease outbreaks among mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif (Spelman et al., 2013) are related to the growing human population surrounding the parks. Nevertheless, these findings provided further rationale for implementation of stricter visitation rules in some parts of the mountain gorillas\u2019 range in order to minimize the risk of disease transmission between visitors and wild human-habituated gorillas.",

PREDICT developed a non-invasive sampling technique to obtain saliva samples from primates via a rope soaked in a fruit-based attractant (e.g. jam). The primate was allowed to chew on the rope that was subsequently retrieved for laboratory analysis (Smiley Evans et al., 2015). PREDICT also helped develop a noninvasive method to detect antibodies against Ebola virus in gorilla feces (Reed et al., 2014). In coordination with this effort, the consortium determined optimal sampling strategies for detection of fecal samples from great apes in Central Africa (Olson et al., 2012b). In addition to improving early detection of circulating virus, these methods will aid in identifying immunologically na\u00efve populations of wild apes that are vulnerable to EVD and could benefit from prevention measures (Reed et al., 2014).",

Because technologies used for viral discovery can be prohibitively expensive and require a high level of expertise, PREDICT virologists compiled a set of relatively simple and inexpensive protocols for the detection of known and novel viruses within viral families that had previously been recognized in animal hosts and known to cause human disease outbreaks, and coupled this cost-effective approach with the selected application of high through-put sequencing (Anthony et al., 2015, Anthony et al., 2013a, Goldstein et al., 2013). Using this strategy, the team detected hundreds of known and novel viruses. For example, the consortium first isolated and characterized a SARS-like coronavirus from a Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus; Ge et al., 2013). The virus was found to bind to the human ACE-2 cell receptor, suggesting that direct transmission to humans from bats would be possible. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, it was originally thought that bat viruses infected people through civets serving as intermediate hosts. However, this discovery provided compelling evidence that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that mitigation strategies should focus on decreasing human-bat contact (Ge et al., 2013).",

To investigate the potential pool of zoonotic viruses in target wildlife hosts and the effort required to better understand the diversity of mammalian viruses, the consortium investigated viral diversity in Pteropus giganteus fruit bats and the sampling effort needed to evaluate viral richness. PREDICT and its partners repeatedly sampled the bats and used PCR with consensus viral primers for nine viral families to saturate the discovery of new viruses in the species (Anthony et al., 2013b). Using statistical techniques similar to those used for estimating vertebrate diversity, the total viral richness within the nine viral families examined in this host was estimated to be 58 viruses. In addition, it was estimated that there is a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses that have yet to be discovered in these nine viral families. Sample size targets calculated from this information indicated that while approximately 7000 samples would need to be analyzed to identify 100% of these new viruses, a much more feasible target of 1300 samples would be needed to identify 80% of the novel viruses (Anthony et al., 2013b).",

PREDICT assisted with the Steering Committee\u2019s formulation of a One Health policy statement, which serves as an important platform for promoting and operationalizing One Health approaches. During disease outbreak investigations, consortium teams worked with local governments on strategies for and implementation of wildlife disease surveillance. PREDICT also collaborated with ministries on pathogen detection and characterization during outbreaks when traditional diagnostic assays for specific viral pathogens provided inconclusive results.",

For example, PREDICT\u2019s discovery of a betacoronavirus (b-CoV) with 96.5% amino acid identity to Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a bat in Mexico informed on the target species for sampling in Saudi Arabia during MERS outbreak investigations (Anthony et al., 2013a). Sampling led to the discovery of a MERS-CoV sequence in a Saudi Egyptian tomb bat with 100% nucleotide identity to the virus from the MERS human index case (Memish et al., 2013). The consortium also generated evidence-based recommendations for disease surveillance during a series of human Ebola outbreak investigations in Africa, focusing mainly on strategies for animal sampling during resource-constrained response efforts, target species, and which diagnostics should be prioritized to rapidly screen for the presence of virus in animal hosts (Olson et al., 2012a). The consortium also provided technical assistance to governments through pathogen detection and characterization during a number of human-only disease outbreaks. For instance, the team developed and optimized a new, highly sensitive technique to reconstruct the genome of a novel rhabdovirus (Bas-Congo virus, or BASV) associated with three human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in Democratic Republic of Congo (Grard et al., 2012). Although the rhabdovirus family had never been documented to cause hemorrhagic fever in people, they are now included in the list of viruses evaluated during hemorrhagic fever outbreaks (Grard et al., 2012).",

However, this new paradigm is only plausible with an improved understanding of the biological and ecological factors driving disease emergence and mitigation strategies aimed at these underlying drivers. Following a series of HPAI outbreaks in the countries where PREDICT was active, the consortium worked in collaboration with partners to improve our understanding of how and where HPAI strains are emerging. Researchers evaluated data on influenza A viruses reported in the public domain in 32 different countries over a 12-year period (2000\u20132011; Rejmanek et al., 2015). Virus evolution was found to be higher in Asian countries, especially in East Asia, relative to North America, providing further evidence of an increased risk of emergence of novel pathogenic strains in East Asia. In addition, large gaps in reporting of influenza A virus activity were identified in Africa and South America. Reporting effort and health care spending (indicator of economic development) were strong predictors of subtype diversity at the country level, emphasizing the need to increase sampling and reporting efforts in under-sampled regions in order to better understand the underlying drivers of influenza A infections around the world (Rejmanek et al., 2015).",

To inform on the investigation and potential role of wild birds as sources of the human infections, the consortium examined the prevalence and distribution of influenza A (H7N9) virus previously reported in wild bird populations and the sample size needed to detect this strain in wild birds (Olson et al., 2013). The prevalence of H7N9 in wild birds was very low, requiring high sample sizes (>30,000 wild birds) for detection. Given the low prevalence in wild birds, PREDICT and its partners recommended targeted risk-based surveillance as an efficient and cost-effective strategy to monitor wild bird populations as a potential source of continued H7N9 infections in poultry and people (Olson et al., 2013).",

Successful One Health approaches require cross-sectoral coordination in which partners look beyond their disciplines to function as a team, despite their diverse organizational mandates, funding sources, and standard operating procedures (Mazet et al., 2014). One Health initiatives often arise from shared threats requiring a multi-agency, cross-sectoral response (Rubin et al., 2014). For example, the H5N1 HPAI outbreak, which brought together a diverse network of partners from the animal and human health sectors, fostered a number of One Health achievements, including a coordinated tripartite surveillance system, which has enabled improved information and data sharing and joint risk assessment (Rubin et al., 2014). However, sustaining effective coordination once the threat has diminished presents a significant challenge. Strong collaborations built during these periods of necessary cooperation, can provide a platform for scaling successful approaches into sustainable One Health programs. The One Health Strategic Plan for Rwanda (https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=one+health+strategic+plan+rwanda) provides another good example of how a clearly defined strategy and a fundamental understanding of the specific roles and mandates of the partners involved can be an effective approach for scaling and sustaining One Health initiatives.",
