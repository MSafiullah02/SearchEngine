During the intervals between the pandemics of 1889, 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009, most of the public, including physicians, did not distinguish between colds and the flu. Influenza A virus is not well controlled in the overall population by antiviral drugs and vaccination, and even during these interpandemic periods, the toll from seasonal influenza in the United States was a remarkable 36,000 deaths annually. Therefore, pathologists have much to potentially contribute to the better understanding the pathogenesis of influenza.",

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses revealed that the distribution of the target cells of the 2009 cases differed from those of seasonal influenza and H5N1 avian influenza.2,3 The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infected not only the tracheobronchial epithelium but also the submucosal glands and alveolar lining cells, particularly type II pneumocytes, which were distinguished from alveolar macrophages and type I pneumocytes by antisurfactant IHC, as sloughed alveolar cells are not easily identified by morphology alone and could be mistaken on a purely morphological basis as alveolar macrophages.1 The concordance of influenza viral antigen with diffuse alveolar damage and infection of type II pneumocytes is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of the 2009 pandemic disease. IHC and polymerase chain reaction were also used to definitively identify the agents of superinfecting bacterial pneumonia: Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and even methicillin-resistant strains.",

Intriguing data from experimental mouse infections suggest that TLR3, the receptor for double-stranded RNA, the genetic material of influenza A virus not only plays a role in controlling viral infection but also contributes to pathogenic innate and adaptive responses that vary with the viral load.6",

Indeed, the current pandemic has been relatively mild. Thus, it is not surprising that the autopsy series has contained a high proportion of patients with comorbid conditions. Mechanisms governing the enhanced disease severity in obesity, asthma, and pregnancy remain as unanswered questions that will provide future directions of research. Interestingly, a study of diet-induced obese mice immune to seasonal H3N2 influenza and challenged with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus revealed more severe illness, higher mortality and viral titers, and reduced levels in the lung of gamma interferon, virus-specific CD8 T cells, and memory CD8 T cell gamma interferon production than nonobese mice.7 It would be useful to pursue these leads in studies of humans with influenza.",
