Many critically ill patients will lack capacity to consent to medical treatment plans because of their illness and/or the treatments that they require. Canadian physicians working in critical care environments should familiarize themselves with provincial guidelines for capacity assessment and determination of the appropriate substitute decision-maker.3,26,27",

Meetings between staff and family and between patients and their caregivers may need to occur remotely by phone or videoconference, which may seem foreign and impersonal. Video chat might also be impractical for those without access to or familiarity in using the technology. For family members with hearing impairment, it may be difficult to accurately receive information over the phone or via video chat.

Families may worry that withdrawal of hydration and nutrition support may increase suffering at end-of-life. Discussing the risks of continuing these interventions and that patients often do not feel hunger or thirst when their body is dying can help substitute decision-makers make informed decisions.48,49 If artificial hydration and/or nutrition are continued, careful monitoring for complications of volume overload is needed. If a Foley catheter is not already in place, the clinician can consider serial bladder scans to ensure that urinary retention is not a source of patient discomfort or insertion of an indwelling catheter. Although there are no evidence-based guidelines addressing this, bladder catheterization once a patient is actively dying may be useful.50,51 It is reasonable to administer medications via an already established intravenous line but if that line becomes interstitial, a subcutaneous lock is a reliable way to administer medications for end-of-life care. This avoids the need to insert a new intravenous line, which is painful and can be challenging in this patient population.",

Nevertheless, some patients with COVID-19 may not display physical evidence of respiratory distress despite significant hypoxemia and the sensation of dyspnea. It is important to ask patients whether they are experiencing dyspnea and whether it is distressing to them. The overarching management principle is to optimize patient comfort while minimizing exposure to staff and visitors. Measures to address dyspnea such as a fan, high flow oxygen (> 6 L\u00b7min\u22121), high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure are sometimes offered for palliation of dyspnea. Based on the current available data, several medical societies have suggested avoiding these aerosol-generating procedures if a private room with a door and appropriate PPE for all providers is not available.52\u201356 Fortunately, use of low flow oxygen or medical air via nasal cannula along with pharmacologic management are usually sufficient to address dyspnea at the end-of-life.57,58",

            "text": "While pandemics create an impetus for all clinicians to review the basics of end-of-life care, this knowledge and skill set are important even in ordinary times. Skilful discussions around goals of care are important not only in critical care but also in perioperative settings. In addition, anesthesiologists have a good understanding of the medications commonly used for symptom management in patients nearing the end-of-life, and are thus well positioned to be involved in their care. This review provides guidance around sensitive discussions about goals of care and the nuances of symptom management during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that anesthesiologists are able to provide the highest quality of care that all patients deserve as they approach the end-of-life.",
