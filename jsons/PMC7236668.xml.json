In this pandemic, not only China but also other country including Japan, Korea, Italy and Iran underwent the series outbreak4. A recent study reported that COVID-19 patients\u2019 clinical symptoms mainly include fever, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, fatigue, myalgia, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia4. Zhu et, at, analyzed the full-genome sequencing of COVID-19 that is a variant from the beta-coronaviruses associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)5. Furthermore, the proved hospital-related transmission in COVID-19 pneumonia has been reported. Of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, 26% of patients needed ICU care and the mortality was 4.3%6.",

Only 20% patients were screened in the preoperative. 80% ESP with COVID-19 was confirmed in the postoperative. Of 54 ESP with COVID-19 patients, all of them displayed bilateral involvement of chest CT scan (Figure 2 A-C).",
