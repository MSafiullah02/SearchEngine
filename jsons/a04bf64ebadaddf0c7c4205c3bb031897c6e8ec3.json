            "text": "H ereditary xanthinuria (HX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of purine metabolism. It results from deficiency of the enzyme 'xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH/XO)' which catalyzes the final two steps in the purine degradation pathway (conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid). The resultant plasma accumulation and excess urinary excretion of xanthine is responsible for the arthropathy, myopathy, crystal nephropathy, urolithiasis, and renal failure seen in this disorder. Most patients belong to Middle East or Mediterranean region, and the disorder is rare in other parts of the world [1, 2] . Two types of HX have been described; type I and type II, based on distinct mutation loci. It is difficult to distinguish the two subtypes on clinical and biochemical grounds, and molecular testing is needed for accurate phenotyping [1] .",

Radiograph of kidney ureter and bladder was normal, while ultrasonography revealed two calculi in the urinary bladder and concretions in the lower pole of left kidney. In view of low serum and urinary uric acid levels and radiolucent nature of renal stones, xanthinuria was suspected. His hospital course was complicated by urethral obstruction which was relieved by catheterization followed by cystolithotomy at a later date. The bladder stones retrieved were subjected to X-ray diffraction study, revealing them to be of xanthine origin. A targeted gene sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutation in the enzyme molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene [heterozygous two base pair deletion in exon 6 (chr18:33785104_33785105delCT) and heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 (chr18:33831134T>G)]. Patient was diagnosed to be having HX type II and advised dietary purine restriction (avoidance of purinerich foods including red and organ meat, shell fish, oily fish, seafood, sweetened beverages such as fruit juices and colas, yeast and mushroom, spinach, peas and whole pulses), and adequate oral hydration.",

His height and weight at nine years were 138.7cm (75th-97th percentile), and 32.1 kg (75th-97th percentile), respectively. Serial annual ultrasonography imaging and renal functions have remained normal with serum uric acid <0.01 mg/dL. HX is a rare disorder of the purine metabolism that leads to urolithiasis. Renal stones can occur at any age, even in infancy [2] . The stones are radiolucent, and are seen in about 40-50% patients with this disorder. The diagnosis may be established with stone analysis, demonstration of an elevated urinary xanthine or hypoxanthine excretion, and measurement of XDH/XO activity in liver or intestinal biopsy sample. The finding of an orange-brown urinary sediment, orange-stained diapers, and profound hypouricemia are other important indicators. However, it is difficult to characterize the exact phenotype of the disorder (type I or II) based on these clinical and biochemical indicators alone, necessitating the use of molecular tests.",
