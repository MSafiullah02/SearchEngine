During this response, there have been calls to halt elective procedures within hospitals in the interests of resource preservation. Through this lens, however, \u201celective\u201d can often be a misnomer. We must acknowledge that many \u201celective\u201d procedures are not truly elective\u2013they are scheduled and, though many are generally not emergency nor urgent, many are medically necessary and time-sensitive (MN-TS). Furthermore, these patients\u2019 conditions or prognoses may deteriorate without timely intervention. What is needed is a pragmatic approach whereby any MN-TS procedure should proceed provided bed space, staffing, and supplies to deliver high-quality care are available. Ambulatory surgery centers generally have no inpatient capacity and can be used to offload less invasive (but still MN-TS) procedures, thereby preserving hospital resources. Surgery on +COVID-19 patients should be deferred, if not absolutely necessary, until they have been asymptomatic for 72 hours and have at least 2 negative COVID-19 tests separated by at least 24 hours. Operative procedures should ideally be performed in a filtered, negative-pressure room.2\n",

Recovery rooms may be used for patient bedding, preoperative areas can be used for staff berthing, and each OR, equipped with its own medical gas, suction, and ventilator, is a potential ICU bed. Many types of PPE, particularly N95 respirators and surgical masks, can and should be worn for the duration of your shift and reused after appropriate cleaning for multiple days, if not overtly soiled.3 Critical to avoiding being overwhelmed is proper triage. Patients who can go home should never be admitted. Under dire circumstances, the most difficult decision may be labeling a living patient (likely critically ill or with major comorbidities) moribund and moving on to the next patient with a greater chance of survival.",

In this case, the opportunity for us as a surgical community is to lead by applying our lessons learned from combat, trauma, and critical care patient management and to take an active role in triage, resource allocation, contingency planning, and even in the care of the gravely ill patient. The alternative is to sit on the sidelines and be marginalized for a nonsurgical problem when our nation, hospitals, and patients need us most.",
