She had a medical history of fish bone ingestion 2 day's before presentation, but no foreign body was identified in the larynx. Examination revealed a temperature of 37.1\u00b0C and biphasic stridor with suprasternal retraction. Indirect laryngoscopy showed subglottic narrowing, and chest radiography was normal. The WBC count was 5.2\u00d7109/L. The presumptive diagnosis was adult croup, and this was confirmed on direct laryngobronchoscopy under inhalational anesthesia which revealed subglottic edema extending 4 to 5 cm down the trachea which was covered with thick secretions. The patient was intubated with a size 6.0 endotracheal tube. A tracheal aspirate grew oral commensals. The patient was treated in the ICU and with humidified oxygen and intravenous antibiotics (cefuroxime, 1.5 g every 8 h). Extubation was attempted after 72 h, but desaturation rapidly occurred and she was reintubated. Dexamethasone, 5 mg every 6 h, was added on day 7. On day 8. plasma sodium concentration was 111 mmol/L, and other biochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, presumably secondary to her airway infection. She was extubated for the second time on day 10, and endoscopy with a flexible endoscope revealed subglottic edema with sloughing. She soon developed biphasic stridor again, and tracheostomy was performed with the patient under local anesthesia. During the procedure, no abnormalities of the tracheal lumen were noted. Histologic examination of a biopsy-specimen of the tracheal wall demonstrated chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. Laryngoscopy with a flexible laryngoscope on day 20 revealed slightly edematous arytenoids, mobile vocal cords, and a normal subglottis. The tracheostomy tube was changed for a cuffless fenestrated tube. Plasma sodium level returned to 137 mmol/L on day 23, and on day 26 the tracheostomy tube was removed. Further recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home after 1 month of hospitalization.",

Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C. There was no stridor, and the pharynx was mildly inflamed. Endoscopic examination with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope showed a normal epiglottis, congested false cords, and edema in the subglottic and tracheal mucosa to 2 cm below the vocal folds. The airway was judged to be adequate. An initial WBC count was 8.7\u00d7109/L with lymphocytes predominant. Intravenous antibiotics, including ampicillin, 1 g every 6 h, cefuroxime, 1.5 g, and metronidazole, 500 mg every 8 h, were immediately commenced. The initial oxygen saturation was 95 to 97% with the patient breathing room air. Five hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had fallen to 85%, but this responded to 35% oxygen therapy via a face mask. Repeated endoscopic assessment confirmed an airway of greater that 8 mm in diameter. A decision was made to continue close observation with continuous pulse oximetry and to perform endoscopy as required. The condition improved gradually over 8 h. Follow-up endoscopy on subsequent days confirmed gradual improvement of the laryngotracheitis. She was discharged on the seventh day after admission. There was no bacterial growth from the throat or laryngeal cultures. Viral titers comparing initial (less than 10) and day 14 (80) titers confirmed an episode of influenza virus type B infection.",

            "text": "We define adult croup as community-acquired acute laryngotracheitis in adult patients who are otherwise healthy. Together with the only other series from Deeb and Einhom,1 ten cases have been reported in the English-language literature since 1966. All these patients survived with supportive airway management. This fact distinguishes adult croup from other causes of tracheitis, with identifiable pathogens, from which patients have succumbed. In the majority of these cases, staphylococcal infections have been identified.2, 3, 4\n,\n9 Herpes simplex virus was isolated in one case after prolonged intubation.5 Cytomegalovirus infection6 and aspergillosis7\n,\n8 of the tracheobronchial tree have been diagnosed in patients with AIDS or in patients who were otherwise immunocompromized. This pattern differs from that identified in pediatric patients.10\n,\n11\nTable 1\nsummarizes all pathogens identified recently as causing acute tracheitis in adults and children. The organisms responsible for croup in children are not seen in adults because of the presence of viral specific T helper and B lymphocyte memory responses. These memory responses in adults can counter the virus growth in the tracheobronchial tree and impede mucosal reactions resulting in airway obstruction. This has been confirmed in a study showing poor T helper and B lymphocyte memory responses in children with human parainfluenza 1 virus-induced croup when compared with a controlled group of adults.12\n",

In order to secure an adequate airway, intubation with the patient under inhalational anesthesia may be indicated. Adjuvant medical treatment for the critical airway includes oxygen, humidification, steroids, and nebulized epinephrine.1 Steroids are used to reduce edema. The use of nebulized epinephrine is not uniform in these cases but was of benefit in one of our cases (case 1). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are advisable to cover potential pathogens which may cause secondary infection. The importance of close observation of clinical signs cannot be overemphasized because the condition may deteriorate rapidly, and continuous oxygen saturation monitoring is mandatory for early detection of a compromised airway.",
