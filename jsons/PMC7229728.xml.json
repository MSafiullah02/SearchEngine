These doctors were rotated on a 10 day shift roster and thereafter, returned back to their departments without segregation nor any cooling off period due to manpower constraints.

This helped tremendously in reducing fatigue and through solidarity, lifted the morale of all the surgical trainees. It was a demonstration of leadership by example at first hand.
