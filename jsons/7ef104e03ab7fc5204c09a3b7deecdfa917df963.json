In all urological departments, quickly inpatient and outpatient services have been significantly reduced. Even in this COVID-19 situation, urological neoplasm care must go on, but significant changes need to be made in the way some care is delivered. We compared diagnostic and therapeutic elective procedures requested and performed for PC management from our multidisciplinary team (MDT) during 1 month activity in the highest national level of COVID-19 infection (March 2020) and under restrictions for all the population, with the management performed in a no-COVID-19 month (March 2019) 1 year ago. The only management that did not received a significant reduction are medical therapies for advanced hormone sensitive (HS) or castration resistant (CR) PC.

Hospitals directly involved in COVID-19 treatment completely suspended all activities related to PC management. Several hospitals not directly involved in COVID-19 treatment equally reduced all urological activities only to emergencies. Compared to other urological neoplasms, PC seems to be less undeferrable in the management. However, even in this time, PC care for clinically significant and high risk cases should go on, correctly selecting cases and procedures. Hoping that COVID-19 pandemic will remain a short time situation, the way we treat PC over the next months will change and will influence medium time results.",

Also for this reason we should avoid or delay those treatments that demonstrated small benefits in terms of clinical progression or cancer related survival. Table 1 describes our MDT identifications of elective undeferrable PC management in this COVID-19 time. PC in several cases is a chronic and slowly progressive disease, alternative treatment options are often available, the population involved is generally particularly vulnerable to this infection for aging and co-morbidities. Early diagnosis of PC can absolutely be delayed in this emergency situation; primary treatments should be carefully evaluated considering the risk for a short term progression and the possible alternatives (active surveillance, surgery, or radiotherapy) [9] . Systemic treatments for high risk and advanced stages should not be stopped as the balance of potential harms that may result from delaying treatment versus the potential not demonstrated benefits of preventing COVID-19 infection and complications could be negative. In this pandemic situation a MDT evaluation for the management of our patients should be implemented where possible in order to assign the most appropriate priority to patients, better balancing oncologic and COVID-19 restraint needs.",
