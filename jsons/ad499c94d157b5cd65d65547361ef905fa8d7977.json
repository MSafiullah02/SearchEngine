The outbreaks of FMD in cattle and swine during 2000 in the United Kingdom have more recently focused worldwide attention on this deadly animal disease [2] . As a member of the family Picornavirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus and the protein capsid encloses a single strand of positive sense RNA. After infection, the viral genome is translated and then cleaved via viral proteases into the mature structural and non-structural proteins [3] .

The VP1 capsid protein has been shown to contain major antigenic determinants. In some instances of protein and peptide vaccines, although the total reactivity of antibodies is high, the level of neutralizing antibodies in comparison is low [9, 10] .

In animals immunized with inactivated vaccines, a good correlation between neutralizing antibody and protection has been observed [16] , and such a correlation has not been well established with animals immunized with nonviral vaccine strategies. These limitations probably have reflected the difficulties of reproducing or mimicking the immunogenicity of an entire viral particle in using simple antigen preparations. Various pieces of evidence suggest that the simpler the epitopic composition of a vaccine, the lower the chances of conferring a solid protection against natural isolates of viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] .

From these two experiments (n = 5 mice/test group), we observed that (1) a 1.9fold higher transgenic CMV-Lux activity was obtained from the electroporation method (i.e. 5.53 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 7 RLU/site) as compared with the gene gun method (i.e. 2.85 \u00b1 0.26 \u00d7 10 7 RLU/site), and (2) a 44-fold higher anti-hAAT antibody titer was obtained from the electroporation method (i.e. reciprocal titer at 1142.9 \u00b1 362.8) as compared with the gene gun method (i.e. reciprocal titer at 25.7 \u00b1 9.8).

Test mice were monitored, and preimmune and post-immune sera collected and analyzed for transgenic VP1 antigen protein expression, and for production of neutralizing antibodies in test mice. We observed that DNA vaccination with plasmid vector expressing VP1 alone routinely induced very low levels of anti-VP1 antibodies and no detectable levels of virus-neutralizing antibody activities in all test mice, providing a very important negative baseline for this study (Tables 1 and 2 ). Replicate (>6) experiments were performed and up to 60 mice tested for the VP1 results shown in Table 2 ; similar results were always obtained. In contrast, however, skin DNA vaccination with a cDNA construct expressing the precursor polypeptide of the four FMDV capsid proteins (VP4-1), namely P1, induced antibodies against the VP1 protein as well as neutralizing antibodies against the FMDV, and resulted in a significant protective immunity (virus clearance) in test mice (Table 2 ). Other than gene-gun-mediated in vivo gene transfer, intramuscular injection of DNA followed by in situ electroporation is another physical means for effective gene vaccination in experimental animal systems. Table 3 shows that a very similar result was obtained from the electroporation-mediated DNA immunization method as compared with the gene gun method. Neutralizing antibody titers and virus clearance in test mice were detected after immunization with P1 cDNA plasmids by in vivo electroporation delivery into muscle tissue.

It would be interesting to investigate in future studies whether various anti-FMDV vaccines or vaccines at different vaccination dosages that confer a substantial difference in viral clearance activities or vaccine efficacy in pigs could also be effectively distinguished from each other within very specific time points of this 2-3 day period of our current mouse model.

Firstly, the transgenic VP1 protein produced in mouse epidermal cells cannot serve as an effective immunogen in our study, yet, in contrast, the VP1 and/or P1 protein moiety(s) from the multiple subunit polyprotein of VP-4, -2, -3 and -1 (as a single chain transgenic P1 protein) can however serve as a potent immunogen, presumably by presenting as a different protein folding as the 'free or single unit' VP1 transgenic protein. Secondly, the transgenic P1 protein, consisting all of the FMD protein components of the virus capsid, may be able to form some kind of modified capsidlike structural assemblies or protein aggregates in test mouse skin cells, effecting as a strong viral immunogen. A third possibility is that endogenous protease (e.g. chymotrypsin) activities of mouse host cells may process the P1 transgenic protein into efficacious configurations or conformations, resulting in production of VP1, P1 or other viral proteins with novel (non-authentic) foldings, and these can serve as potent viral protein epitopes. Western blot analyses (Figure 2 ) showed that the P1 precursor polypeptide can be transiently expressed between low (for Exp.-1) to readily (for Exp.-2) detectable levels. In Exp.-2, different animals from Exp.-1 were used, and we observed an increased abundance of P1 protein. For both experiments, correct size and transgenic VP1 protein, derived by 'host cell' processing, were clearly detected at high levels in test pig skin tissues that were genegun-transfected with the P1 cDNA expression constructs. These results suggest that authentic and intact transgenic P1 and VP1 viral proteins were produced in immunized animals. Xing et al. [39] have studied the interactive, multiple domains of the FMDV for involvement of VP3, -2 and -1 proteins on the topical structure of FMDV. Their findings and our collaboration with them in this study led us to suggest that capsid-like protein aggregates or 'viruslike particles' (VLP) from transgenic P1 products may exist transiently or at relatively low frequency.

Throughout multiple independent experiments, using both gene-gun-and electroporation-mediated DNA vaccinations with a plasmid vector expressing only the VP1 cDNA, no detectable effect on the production of antiviral neutralizing antibodies and virus clearance in a total of 60 VP1 tested mice has been seen (Tables 2 and 3 ).
