These respiratory infections induce the most common illnesses [1] and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide, especially children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals [2\u20134]. On a statistical basis, children represent a highly susceptible group, as they may experience multiple infections each year until they reach the age of 10 [5]. Respiratory viral infections also represent an economic threat for agriculture, especially in cattle, swine, and poultry production. The idea that viruses can cause respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated since the early 1930s [2]. Nevertheless, with the help of modern diagnostic tools, a significant number of new respiratory viruses have been discovered since the beginning of the twenty-first century and it is estimated that there are about 200 antigenically distinct viruses able to cause infection of the respiratory tract, especially in infants and children [6]. In fact, it is now believed that viruses cause 95 % of respiratory diseases in children and infants, and about 30\u201340 % in the elderly [2].\n",

Several infections are self-limited and the infection remains local as the virus is cleared by the immune system in the respiratory tract with minimal clinical consequences. However, in some circumstances, viruses can avoid the immune response and cause more severe respiratory diseases [1] or even spread to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), where they could induce other types of pathologies [7].",

            "text": "Over the years, the CNS has been shown to represent a frequent site of viral infection. Using different routes of entry, several different viruses, including respiratory pathogens, have been shown to be able to penetrate the CNS (neuroinvasion), where they can infect neurons and glial cells (neurotropism) and possibly induce or participate in the induction of neurological diseases (neurovirulence) [8]. In humans, a long list of viruses possess these \u201cneuroproperties\u201d and infection often leads to acute encephalitis, which can be fatal depending on virus tropism [9]. Rabies virus [10], herpes simplex virus (HSV) [11], and arthropod-borne flaviviruses [12] can induce encephalitis in humans. Chronic human neurological diseases may also be linked to viral infection. In acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia and related disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces neurodegeneration [13], which can result in motor dysfunctions and possibly cognitive impairments [14]. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a human demyelinating disease [15] where prolonged immunosuppression leads to reactivation of latent polyoma JC virus (JCV) [16]. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive fatal neurological disease, is caused by CNS persistence of measles virus [17]. Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) causes progressive tropical spastic paraperesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (PTSP/HAM) in 1\u20132 % of infected individuals [18] and HSV-1 and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) were proposed to cause or exacerbate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [19].",

One of two most important sequelae associated with MV infection is immunosuppression, which facilitates infection by opportunistic bacteria or parasites that can lead to pneumonia or diarrhea. A second type of rare but significant sequelae is long-term CNS disease [26]. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurs in 1 of 1,000 measles cases in children and adolescents. Measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) is a second CNS complication that can arise after a MV infection in immune-compromised patients.

            "text": "Influenza virus comes in three types: A, B, and C. Types A and B cause the flu syndrome, characterized by chills, fever, headache, sore throat, and muscle pains [31], and are responsible for seasonal epidemics that affect 3\u20135 million humans, of which 250,000\u2013500,000 cases are lethal each year [32]. Although influenza type C virus is less frequent in humans, it is also distributed around the world where it mainly infects infants and young children; most of the time infection results in mild upper respiratory tract illnesses. However, complications associated with lower respiratory tract infection do occur in children under 2 years of age [33, 34]. Human influenza A virus is of particular interest because of its capacity to recombine and rearrange with its avian and porcine counterparts to generate new emerging viruses that are introduced into the human population and that may lead to pandemic outbreaks associated with significant morbidity and mortality, as it was observed at least four times during the twentieth century and already once in the twenty-first century [32, 35]. Influenza virus type A is highly contagious and, even though most infections are localized to the upper respiratory tract, some more severe cases may result in pneumonia [36] and even complications involving the CNS [37]. Several studies have shown that influenza A can be associated with encephalitis, Reye\u2019s syndrome, febrile seizure, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and possibly acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in humans [31, 38\u201341]. Making use of murine models, it has also been shown that influenza A virus could reach the CNS through the olfactory nerve route and alter hippocampal morphology or expression of synaptic regulatory genes while impairing cognition and emotional behavior [42, 43]. Influenza A virus was also described as a factor which may increase the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [37].",

Some examples of coronaviruses that can infect livestock or poultry, in which they have a respiratory tropism, are transmissible gastrointestinal virus (TGEV) and its associated S protein deletion mutant: porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus (PHEV), which infect swine; bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which infects cattle; and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which infects chicken [51]. Several of these animal coronaviruses cause severe economic burden to poultry, swine, and cattle industries worldwide. Other animal coronaviruses that have a respiratory tropism are feline coronavirus (FCoV); canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV); and bat CoV, which infects the bat species Miniopterus [51].",

Neurological symptoms may occur in cats infected with a highly virulent FCoV variant, designated FIPV [52, 53]. Neurological disease appears partially immune-mediated and may result in uncontrolled secretion of cytokines [54] that leads to diverse pathological manifestations including meningitis [55] and even spinal cord involvement [56]. Furthermore, there is often a small amount of infectious FCoV present in brain tissue [52]. The PHEV was isolated from the brains of suckling pigs suffering from encephalomyelitis several years ago in Canada [57] and the disease could be reproduced experimentally in piglets following intranasal inoculation [58]. After oronasal infection, it was shown that the virus first infects epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and small intestine and, using retrograde neuronal spreading via peripheral nerves, was able to enter the CNS [59]. More recently, the neuroinvasiveness and neurotropism of the virus were again demonstrated in a murine model, where PHEV induced a poor inflammatory reaction in the CNS and infected cells showed no cytopathological changes [60].",

However, when a variant emerged from animals in Southeast Asia to cause the first pandemic of the twenty-first century: the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, these apparently innocuous viruses suddenly became \u201cmore interesting.\u201d Indeed, the 2002\u20132003 SARS pandemic was caused by a coronavirus variant that appears to have emerged from a bat reservoir to infect palm civets, sold live in open markets, which served as intermediate reservoirs before crossing into humans. Moreover in the fall of 2012, 10 years after the SARS episode, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the international medical community, that a SARS-like disease affected individuals that traveled from the Arabian Peninsula to the United Kingdom, which may indicate a possible resurgence of SARS. However, using molecular sequencing, it was rapidly shown that this new respiratory coronavirus was genetically different from SARS-CoV, underlining the importance of a molecular approach in making a viral diagnostic. It is now recognized that the new epidemic is caused by a new coronavirus from the genus Betacoronavirus that was first named HCoV-EMC (for Human Coronavirus\u2014Erasmus Medical Center), human betacoronavirus 2c, and NCoV or nCoV (for novel Coronavirus), and that is now known under the official name MERS-CoV: the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [50]. As of August 30, 2013, WHO indicated that the MERS-CoV has spread to eight different countries, where 108 laboratory-confirmed cases of individuals have been identified as infected by the MERS-CoV, with 50 deaths [70].",

Since they eventually become macrophages as they invade tissues, this activation suggests that HCoV-229E-infected monocytes would serve to facilitate their passage toward other tissues including the CNS, especially in immune-compromised individuals, as this was observed for murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) [88]. The fact that HCoV-229E could only infect partially immune-compromised transgenic mice [89] suggests that HCoV-229E could take advantage of an immune-suppressed environment and disseminate to the CNS within susceptible individuals. The establishment of a persistent infection in a human leukocytic cell line [83] is also consistent with the possibility that monocytes/macrophages serve as a reservoir and vector for this neuroinvasive HCoV [63]. The SARS-CoV also infects monocytes/macrophages [68, 86] and dendritic cells, in which it modulates innate immunity [87]. These cells could also serve as a reservoir for the virus to reach and maintain itself in the CNS. Our results indicate that HCoV could also infect human endothelial cells of the BBB in culture (unpublished data) and it has been speculated that SARS-CoV could do the same after viremia [90]. Therefore, the neuroinvasive HCoV could use the hematogenous route to penetrate into the CNS.",

Although viruses were also detected in some control brains, there was a significantly higher prevalence of HCoV-OC43 in brains of MS patients [63]. Moreover, these data, in association with the observation that autoreactive T-cells recognized both viral and myelin antigens in MS patients but not in controls [108, 109] during infection by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, suggest that the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of neuropathologies such as MS in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals (data summarized in Table 1). Furthermore, even though the use of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A in HCoV-OC43-infected mice resulted in a faster onset of encephalitis, suggesting a role for T-cells in viral clearance and survival with no related immunopathology [71], it was shown that in recombination activation gene (RAG) knock-out mice, HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection [93]. The participation of different types of T-cells has been shown to play a significant role in the demyelinating neurological disease induced by the murine CoV, in particular for strain MHV-JHM [110], which represents the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43.\n",

Importantly, these S point mutations were acquired after persistent infections of human neural cell lines [112]. Moreover, we also showed that infection by the S mutants is linked to glutamate excitotoxicity [113]. Therefore, as this increase in cytokine production may induce damages to the neurons [114] that can be associated with problems in glutamate homeostasis, which in the end may create glutamate excitotoxicity [115], it can contribute to neuronal degeneration associated with hind-limb paralysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and possible demyelination [111, 113]. The outcome of the observed degeneration of neurons may eventually lead to the death of these essential cells.\n",

            "text": "When present in the murine CNS, HCoV-OC43 infects neurons in several different regions of the brain [48] (Fig. 1) before reaching the spinal cord. Infection of these essential cells induces their degeneration [111, 113], as observed by aberrant state of neurofilament phosphorylation, a situation that often leads to cell death and that could be directly induced by viral replication. Furthermore, using two model cell lines of differentiated human neurons, we demonstrated that programmed cell death (PCD) was induced after HCoV-OC43 infection [116, 117] and that the inhibition of viral replication was also in direct correlation with increased cell survival, suggesting that infection and production of new infectious viruses directly participate in the process of degeneration and eventual death of neurons. Our results indicate that the underlying mechanisms appear to involve different cellular factors and pathways, including caspase-independent apoptosis, parthanatos, and necroptosis, three forms of programmed cell death (PCD), which are reviewed elsewhere by the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) [118]. These cell death pathways can act separately but may also interact in response to a stimulus (including a viral infection), as they share some of the cellular factors involved in the overall process that leads to cell death and that often converges toward mitochondria [118]. Figure 3 is a tentative representation of the various pathways and cellular factors involved during HCoV-OC43-induced PCD of infected neurons. It is based on our data [111, 113, 116, 117] and on the scientific literature that describes some molecular pathways (parthanatos, necroptosis and apoptosis) and cellular factors, including calcium overload, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, excitotoxicity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), calpain and oxidative stress related to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventual neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death [118\u2013120]. Virus\u2013cell interaction is always important in the regulation of cell response to infection. For HCoV-OC43, we clearly showed that the viral S glycoprotein is an important factor of neurovirulence and neurodegeneration of infected cells [111, 113, 116]. This was similarly shown for coronavirus strains MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM, which represent subspecies of the MuCoV species, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43 as they are both members of the Betacoronavirus genus. Indeed, several reports and reviews have, over the years, described that S protein of this neuroinvasive and neurotropic murine coronavirus is a major factor associated with neurovirulence during encephalitis and the eventual demyelinating disease in susceptible mice [121, 122]. Our more recent data also demonstrated that the HE protein is an important factor for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43, suggesting an attenuation of the eventual spread of viruses deficient in fully active HE protein into the CNS [123]. Therefore, as the infection of neuronal cells apparently directly participate in the induction of neuronal death, by abrogating the production of infectious virus, the HE protein of HCoV-OC43 could play a role in neurovirulence of HCoV-OC43, like it does for MHV [124].\n",

Furthermore, the involvement of SARS-CoV in CNS infections was underscored by the findings that made use of transgenic mouse models expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (the cellular receptor used by SARS-CoV to infect susceptible cells). Indeed, using these mice, it was shown that SARS-CoV could invade the CNS after an intranasal infection primarily through the olfactory bulb [95] or even after an intraperitoneal infection [125], with concomitant neuronal loss [95, 125]; a phenomenon that can eventually lead to neurological problems.",

Knowledge of mechanisms and consequences of virus interactions with the nervous system is essential to better understand potentially pathological consequences and design intervention strategies that are appropriate to encephalitis or exacerbations of other types of neurological diseases for which a given virus is involved. In that regard, Hill\u2019s criteria adapted by Giovannoni and collaborators may represent a highly relevant tool to evaluate the relevance of human coronaviruses as a factor which will influence the development and/or exacerbation of a chronic human neurological disease potentially related to a viral infection. Therefore, collecting new data will be instrumental to our understanding of how the ubiquitous human coronaviruses, given the proper susceptibility conditions and proper virus evolution and infection conditions, could participate in the induction or exacerbation of human neuropathologies.",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a03: Pathways of neuronal degeneration and cell death induced by HCoV\u2013OC43 infection. Several cellular factors that regulate various mechanisms are activated in response to infection, which leads to programmed cell death (PCD). (1) Hallmarks of apoptosis, including relocalization of the activated pro-apoptotic protein BAX (Bcl-2 associated protein X) from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome C release from mitochondria toward the cytosol, DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspases -3 and -9, are observed during infection of human neurons. However, using a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), cell death is not abrogated after infection, suggesting a caspase-independent type of apoptosis. (2) Relocalization of the mitochondrial protein AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) toward the nucleus (tAIF) is observed after infection and participates in DNA fragmentation in conjunction with CypA (cyclophilin A) and histone H2AX. The AIF is known to be activated during caspase-independent apoptosis. However, AIF is also involved in Parthanatos, another form of PCD potentially associated with neurodegeneration. As they are synthesized by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) during a neuronal stress, including during HCoV\u2013OC43 infection, polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) may relocalize toward mitochondria and participate in the activation and relocalization of AIF toward the cytosol before it reaches the nucleus. Cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibition decreases AIF release from mitochondria and abrogates cell death induced by infection. (3) AIF release from mitochondria may be induced through its truncation (tAIF) by activated calpain, which is usually activated by a rise in the mitochondrial calcium concentration. (4) This increase in calcium concentration may be linked with either an important entry from the extracellular milieu (for instance during excitotoxicity) or with a release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following induction of ER stress. Both situations are probably taking place after infection of neurons by HCoV-OC43. The increase in calcium concentration in mitochondria may also induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be harmful for mitochondria and hence neurons. (5) The presence during infection of an inhibitor (Nec-1) of the receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP-1), significantly increases cell survival and partially abrogates viral replication, suggesting that necroptosis, a third form of PCD which involves RIP-1 and RIP-3 downstream of the tumor necrosing factor (TNF) receptor family (in the form of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)), may play a role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal death.
