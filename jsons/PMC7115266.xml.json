A team of medical students carried out the data collection. The questionnaires were pilot tested on a convenience group of 20 students and modified accordingly. The final version consisted of multiple choice questions and was handed out in classrooms after obtaining consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee. Sociodemographic details of each student included age, marital status, medical year, and locality. Only those who were aware of the H1N1 pandemic were asked (1) mode of transmission; (2) signs and symptoms of H1N1; (3) response if H1N1 symptoms are found; and (4) concern about contracting H1N1.",
