            "text": "The study of epidemic processes [1] has been one of the fundamental levers in the development of modern network science [2]. Research in this field has been based on the consideration of several simplified epidemic models [3], the most fundamental being the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models. In both of them, a susceptible (healthy) individual, in contact through an edge with an infected individual, contracts the disease at rate \u03b2. In the SIS model infected nodes become spontaneously susceptible again at rate \u03bc, while in the SIR model infected individuals become removed and cannot contract the disease again. This variation results in a different collective behavior: SIS allows for a long-lived (infinitely long in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size) steady state with a finite fraction of infected individuals, while the SIR model proceeds by epidemic outbreaks of finite duration that reach a given fraction of individuals in the population. Both these models are characterized by the presence of an epidemic threshold \u03bbc for the control parameter, defined as the ratio between the infection and the healing rates, \u03bb=\u03b2/\u03bc. In the SIS model, the region \u03bb\u2264\u03bbc corresponds to the healthy phase, in which epidemic episodes die out exponentially fast; for \u03bb>\u03bbc, on the other hand, a steady state with a finite fraction of infected individuals is observed. For the SIR model, on the other hand, the healthy phase corresponds to outbreaks affecting an infinitesimally small fraction of the population, while for \u03bb>\u03bbc the final fraction of removed individuals becomes finite.",

Under these assumptions, both the SIR and the SIS processes exhibit a threshold \u03bbcHMF inversely proportional to the second moment q2 of the degree distribution P(q) characterizing the topology of the network [2]. For a distribution scaling as a power law for a large degree, P(q)\u223cq\u2212\u03b3, as empirically observed in many contexts [7], this second moment scales, for \u03b3\u22643, as q2\u223cqmax3\u2212\u03b3, where qmax is the maximum degree in the network [8]. In this regime \u03b3\u22643, the maximum degree diverges in the limit of infinite network size, leading to a vanishingly small epidemic threshold. For \u03b3>3, instead, both the second moment and the threshold attain a finite value in the thermodynamic limit.",

This amounts to disregarding, in the epidemic evolution, the possibility of backtracking paths allowing for the mutual reinfection of pairs of connected nodes. A theory based on the mapping of the SIR model onto bond percolation [19] leads to an epidemic threshold for the SIR model given by the inverse of the largest eigenvalue \u039bMH of the Hashimoto, or nonbacktracking, matrix [20,21]. This matrix has also been applied to the definition of centrality measures in networks [22] and to the detection of communities [23].

Application of the MP approach to the SIS model provides a set of differential equations that can be solved to obtain the evolution of the prevalence (density of infected individuals) as a function of time and leads to an epidemic threshold again inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue \u039bMH of the nonbacktracking matrix. Based on numerical simulations of the SIS process on a variety of small real and synthetic networks, the authors of Ref. [25] conclude that their MP approach provides an accurate estimate of the evolution of prevalence with time, as it takes properly into account dynamical correlations (neglected in both the HMF and QMF approaches), as well as a better bound for the epidemic threshold.",

Comparing the predictions of QMF and MP theories, as given by the inverse of the largest eigenvalues of the adjacency and Hashimoto matrices, with each other and with direct large scale numerical simulations of the SIS model on real and uncorrelated synthetic networks, we show that MP theory does not capture the correct behavior of the epidemic threshold, particularly for large values of the degree exponent \u03b3. We also observe that the MP prediction for the threshold is not a bound for the true value, while the scaling of the threshold with network size is instead more accurately described by QMF theory. Moreover, we consider a modified SIS model in which backtracking is hindered and show that its behavior radically differs from the original SIS model. Our work shows that backtracking paths, at odds with the claims in Ref.

As we can see from Fig. 1, the difference between the two LEVs is minimal, being almost equal with the exception of the networks with a low level of heterogeneity, as measured by the factor q2/q. Thus, only for small values of q2/q is the LEV of the Hashimoto matrix noticeably smaller than \u039bMA.

Indeed, the MP prediction seems, in this case, to work slightly better than QMF. This is due to the additional term of \u22121 in Eq. (3) with respect to Eq. (2). This term accounts for dynamical correlations that in general prevent a node from infecting the node that transmitted the disease to it in the first place, as the latter is, with high probability, still infected [17]. The opposite occurs, on the other hand, for \u03b3>5/2. In the case \u03b3=2.8, both the inverse numerical SIS threshold and the QMF and MP predictions diverge in the large size limit, but the slope of the growth of the SIS threshold is better captured by QMF. For \u03b3=3.2, the MP prediction tends to a constant value, while the inverse SIS threshold grows as a power law in the same fashion as the inverse QMF prediction. Notice also that while the QMF prediction is an upper bound for the inverse threshold, this is clearly not the case for the MP prediction.",

Indeed, in that case, each infection event practically \u201cremoves\u201d the corresponding edge, which is not available any longer for transmitting the infection. In the long run all edges are removed, and the absorbing state with all nodes in state S is the only possible asymptotic configuration. Therefore, we consider a modified SIS dynamics where backtracking events are prohibited but only until other infection events take place. Our model, which we dub nonbacktracking SIS (NBSIS) dynamics, is defined in terms of the SIS dynamics, with the following addition: If at a certain time node j is infected by node i and then i becomes susceptible, j cannot transmit the epidemic back to node i before some other neighbor m of i (m\u2260j) reinfects it. An illustration of this type of dynamics is provided in Fig. 5. The central node is initially infected; it transmits the disease to two of its neighbors and then recovers. The two neighbors cannot retransmit the infection back to it. However, they can transmit the infection to other neighbors of theirs that can, in their turn, reinfect the central node. With this recipe, local echo chamber effects are strongly depressed. This small variation can have important effects even in simple network structures. In the case of a star network, composed of a hub of degree q connected to q leaves of degree 1, it is trivial to observe that the NBSIS model does not allow a steady state. Indeed, leaves can be infected only by the hub; therefore, once a leaf has been infected, it cannot be infected by any other node, and thus, after it spontaneously recovers, it has no chance to be reinfected again. The NBSIS epidemic dies out in a few time steps after its onset. This behavior is in contrast to the SIS dynamics on star networks, which can sustain long-lived steady states as soon as \u03bb>1/q\n[36]. The same lack of an active state is observed in generic tree networks [2] when the infection starts at a single node.\n",

In the NBSIS model, on the other hand, if \u03bb\u2192\u221e, the initial infected seed infects all its nearest neighbors in the initial time steps. These infected neighbors cannot reinfect the seed due to the nonbacktracking condition, and therefore, the seed, once recovered, cannot become infected again and thus becomes effectively removed from the network. The neighbors of the seed experience a similar fate, after infecting all their neighbors.

Moreover, as Fig. 6(b) shows, this time interval does not depend on the system size, revealing that for any value of \u03bb the only stable state is the absorbing one. In the case \u03b3<5/2 [Fig. 6(c)] we observe some differences: The initial plateau is followed by an intermediate regime with a decay slower than exponential. For fixed \u03bb and increasing network size N [Fig. 6(d)], the decay toward the absorbing state occurs over temporal scales that grow with N.

The elimination of backtracking paths imposed by the NBSIS model forbids these reinfection events and thus completely destroys this triggering mechanism. On the other hand, for \u03b3<5/2 the transition is triggered by a different subset of nodes, identified with the K core of the maximum index [26]. This subgraph is composed of nodes with a fairly high number of mutual interconnections. It therefore provides many possible paths through which infection can propagate from one node to another, circumventing the cancellation of direct backtracking paths.

            "text": "We can obtain a further confirmation of this picture by reinterpreting the NBSIS model in terms of coupled SIS and dynamic bond percolation processes [38]. In this sense, when a node i infects nodes j for the first time, this dynamic step blocks the edge pointing from j to i for further infections until i is again infected by a node m\u2260j. Accordingly, an infection event from i to j can unblock an edge from k\u2260j, previously blocked due to an infection event at a past time from k to j. Thus, the NBSIS dynamics behave as a SIS model in which edges are blocked and unblocked in a percolation-like process due to infection events between pairs of nodes. Notice that this percolation process is intrinsically different from the standard one [38] since the blocking is dynamic and correlated. In this framework, it is easy to see that a steady active state can be achieved only when the density of blocked edges reaches a steady state of not very large value. In Fig. 7 we plot the normalized density of blocked edges \u03b7(t) and the prevalence \u03c1(t) as a function of time for different values of \u03b3 and \u03bb. We observe that during the transient state the density of blocked states is also approximately constant over time. However, the pseudo-steady state eventually ends, and the density of blocked states resumes growth and attains, when the absorbing state is reached, values close to \u03b7=1/2, which corresponds to each edge in the network being blocked in one direction. This occurs for both large and small values of \u03b3.\n",

They are at the core of the mechanism that keeps epidemics active in power-law distributed networks with a low level of heterogeneity (i.e., for a large degree exponent), in which repeated reinfection events between the hub and its nearest neighbors are able to keep the infection alive for large intervals of time and to propagate it to the rest of the network. Disallowing such backtracking paths leads inevitably to the elimination of the steady state of the SIS model. In this case, a better description is provided by quenched mean-field theory, predicting the threshold is the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network.",

[25] it is also argued that MP provides a better approximation of the probability that individual nodes are infected at a given time. In Fig. 8 we clarify this issue by comparing Monte Carlo estimates of the prevalence of the SIS process as a function of time on the karate club network (the same as considered in [25]) with the QMF and MP predictions obtained from direct numerical integration of the corresponding nonlinear differential equations. Details are provided in the figure caption. We observe here that, away from the critical point, QMF theory provides a very good approximation of the steady-state prevalence measured over surviving runs, that is, over runs that, at given time t, have not yet fallen into the absorbing state. On the other hand, MP theory appears closer to the steady-state prevalence computed averaging over all runs, including those already in the absorbing state. Regarding the evolution of the prevalence at short times, we can see that MP appears slightly closer to numerical results than QMF theory. Close to the critical point, at short times QMF and MP practically coincide. In the steady state, QMF provides a very good match to the steady state of surviving rules, while MP predicts a steady state that does not match any of the simulations results. Considering that for all finite networks the dynamics fall, sooner or later, into the absorbing state, information about the critical probabilities is to be estimated using only surviving runs [39]. It is therefore clear that QMF provides a better estimate of the critical properties of the SIS model.\n",
