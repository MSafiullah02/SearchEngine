Mild local lesions were observed. B. Rechecking on February 18, it was found that the lesion had obvious absorption. At this time, the viral nucleic acid test was still positive.

During the process of the quarantine, body temperature was daily monitored, and chest computed tomography (CT) regularly checked. Peripheral blood test results showed that the total number of white blood cells and lymphocytes in these patients were basically normal. The screening for pneumonia by chest CT found five cases with small area of glass exudative lesions on the edge of lung ( Fig. 1 A-C) , implying that these individuals would be difficult to detect except through pathogen tests and chest CT scanning. Finally, 9 patients subsequently had respiratory infections symptoms such as cough and fever, lately they were diagnosed as COVID-19. In order to observe the outcome of the virus carriers, these asymptomatic infected persons were managed in isolation wards, and took Lopinavir-Ritonavir as well as Chinese medicine under the guidance of physicians to avoid possible progression to COVID-19. Eventually, these asymptomatic patients were discharged from hospital after two consecutive negative of viral nucleic acid test.",
