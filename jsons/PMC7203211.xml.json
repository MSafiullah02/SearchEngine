Zou and colleagues (5) analyzed the nasal and pharyngeal viral load in 17 symptomatic adult patients. Higher viral loads were detected soon after the onset of symptoms, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than the throat. Importantly, a comparable viral load was detected in asymptomatic patients tested, suggesting the possibility of transmission from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients. Similarly, Rothe et al. (6) reported the first probable case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Europe occurring from an asymptomatic adult during the incubation period. Recently, first data regarding viral load in children have been published. Cai et al. (7) described the SARS-CoV-2 infection in 10 children and confirmed a mild presentation and, importantly, documented prolonged virus shedding from both the respiratory tract and the feces during the convalescent stage. Also Xu et al. documented the fecal spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in children (8). Importantly, they found that fecal shedding lasted more than the nasopharyngeal one also in asymptomatic children, suggesting that thay can play a role in the spread of the infection, as they do with other respiratory viruses.",

To date, SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not bearing attention and interest because it seems not clinically relevant. However, as pediatricians we are aware that children are extremely prone to contract and spread viral infections. Since the SARS-CoV-2 test is performed only to symptomatic patients or known contacts, how can we ensure that the small number of documented pediatric infections is not a huge underestimation? Moreover, the isolation of common respiratory viruses from children's nasal swabs is very frequent and, in the current circumstances, we could have mistakenly confirmed an exclusive etiological diagnosis without suspecting SARS-CoV-2 as an additional threat. We know little about potential coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 and other more common respiratory viruses.",

This choice was based on the concern for aggregation and not on scientific evidence of a child-to-child transmission. Further information on transmission dynamics are needed, as well as a good understanding of the real burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, in order to improve our screening practices. Children in high-burden areas should be tested and results correlated with their recent medical history as well as with infectious status of close contacts, in order to understand how and how long they shed the virus. Moreover, the better knowledge of the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection can clarify the underlying mechanisms that lead children to develop paucysymptomatic disease; this, in turn, can help researchers in findings novel therapeutic strategies against viral infections in general, and COVID-19 in particular. Recenlty, Spanish researchers evaluated a large series of children evaluated in 30 tertiary hospitals during the first 2 weeks of the epidemic in Spain (10). Although they found that only 41 of the 4,695 confirmed cases (0.8%) were children younger than 18 years of age, they only tested those evaluated in hospitals. This is an important limitation since most children are expected to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (11), and to know the real burden of pediatric COVID-19 and how this influences the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion, we need to test children in the community, in both high and low SARS-CoV-2 burden settings and compare results. Importantly, children should be tested with both nasopharyngeal and rectal swab, since authors state that pharyngeal and nasal swab sensitivity is as low as 32\u201363% (12). More importantly, serological studies are necessary to understand the real burden of pediatric COVID-19. We need to know that and stop neglecting and not considering children, this will really help in understanding epidemics in general (not only the current one) and knowledge gained will help to better manage the next one, which will come soon or later.",
