            "text": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains is a major health problem worldwide. There is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by MDR strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Quorum sensing (QS) is a critical communication system in bacterial community controlling survival and virulence. The awareness of the importance of QS in bacterial infections has stimulated research to identify QS inhibitors (QSIs) to defeat microbes. In this study, four FDA-approved drugs (besides azithromycin as positive QSI) were tested for potential QS inhibition against clinical A. baumannii isolates and P. aeruginosa (PAO1) standard strain. The inhibitory effect of these drugs on virulence factors of both microbes has been investigated. The studied virulence factors include biofilm formation, twitching and swarming motilities, proteolytic enzyme production, and resistance to oxidative stress. The four tested drugs (erythromycin, levamisole, chloroquine, and propranolol) inhibited QS in Chromobacterium violaceum by 84, 72, 55.1, and 37.3%, respectively. They also significantly inhibited virulence factors in both PAO1 and A. baumannii at sub-inhibitory concentrations. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and mice mortality test, where tested drugs highly repressed the expression of abaI gene and showed significantly improved mice survival rates. In addition, molecular docking studies against AbaI and AbaR proteins of QS system in A. baumannii revealed the potential inhibition of QS by tested drugs. Beside their known activities, the tested drugs could be given new life as QSIs to combat A. baumannii nosocomial infections (alone or in combination with antimicrobials).",

They cause a wide spectrum of infections from skin and wound infections to septicemia and hospital outbreaks worldwide; both organisms are resistant to several classes of antibiotics making their treatment very difficult [1] . The MDR pattern can be transferred to the other organisms that initially do not show such resistance [2] . In addition, biofilm production in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa encourages increased colonization and persistence in hospital environments leading to higher rates of device-related infections [3] . To solve the problem of limited therapeutic options, it is very vital to find new therapeutic strategy to combat A. baumannii infections.",

Therefore, interfering with QS is considered as a promising strategy to combat bacterial infections by inhibiting bacterial virulence hence affecting the ability of pathogens to cause diseases rather than affecting their growth which does not impose a selection pressure and helps to avoid emergence of resistance [5] . Consequently, QSI would increase the susceptibility of the pathogen to host defense and clearance by the host immune system [6] .",

In the present study, it was found that the tested drugs have inhibited QS in CV026 biosensor as indicated by inhibition of violacein pigment production. CV026 responds to C6-HSL and produces violacein, but in presence of QSIs, no pigment is produced. It is noticed that azithromycin and erythromycin formed an intense violet ring around the inhibition zone. This may be attributed to a potentiating effect for violacein production with a certain concentration of these inhibitors. This finding was in accordance with that of Liu et al. [44] . The highest inhibition of violacein pigment was recorded for erythromycin and azithromycin followed by levamisole, chloroquine, and propranolol; erythromycin has the highest QS inhibitory activity. This was consistent with several reports which reported that antibiotics interfere with QS by blocking C 12 -HSL production in P. aeruginosa [13, 45] .",

A. baumannii surface-associated motility is a flagellum-independent, complex process that is dependent on many factors including QS [25, 69, 72] . It has been speculated that TFP might be involved in the surface-associated motility of A. baumannii [68] . In the present study, 50% of A. baumannii isolates were positive in surface-associated motility. In agreement with our results, Era\u00e7 et al.

Any variation in the physical factors could have effect on motility; we also found that using low salt concentration in the media gives better motility. All the tested QSIs inhibited surface motility; \u2265 20% inhibition was observed in presence of azithromycin, erythromycin, and levamisole. In addition, \u2265 50% inhibition was recorded in 7 isolates in presence of erythromycin.

Autoinducer synthase mutant was found to produce small amount of antioxidant enzymes indicating the importance of QS in response to oxidative stress [70] . In the current study, the effect of H 2 O 2 was highly augmented (tolerance to oxidative stress was reduced) in presence of sub-MIC of erythromycin (10-100%) and levamisole (3.3-100%).

Moreover, the behavior of bacteria in lab differs from that in human body, and characteristics of drugs in lab also differ from those in human body where the drug may undergo degradation, conformational changes, re-arrangement, and plasma protein binding. Therefore, all in vitro studies are considered as a beginning step and must be fulfilled with in vivo studies. To compensate this shortage in reaching the drug therapeutic plasma level with some drugs, it could be possible to use QSIs with high MIC values in topical formulations like dressings or ointments for skin and soft-tissue infections and aerosols for respiratory infections. Also, QSIs with high MIC can be tested in future study in combination with antibiotics using low concentration of these QSIs that not exceed their accepted therapeutic levels.",

            "text": "A more confirmation of QS inhibitory mechanism of the tested drugs was done using the molecular docking study. It was revealed that erythromycin showed higher binding affinity than SAM (the natural ligand of AbaI) while levamisole had the lowest binding affinity. Moreover, all drugs bound with the active site of the ligand-binding domain of AbaI by hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding. In addition, molecular docking study ranked the activity of the compounds as inhibitors for AbaR receptor with chloroquine being the most active, followed by propranolol with a score similar to the natural ligand. The binding interactions with the receptor were by hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding except levamisole, which had no H-bonding. Erythromycin exhibited the lowest inhibition for AbaR receptor. Therefore, the potential mechanism of QS inhibition by the 4 tested drugs may be due to either binding to the AbaI autoinducer synthase preventing AHL synthesis, or binding to AbaR receptor preventing AHL signal reception. Finally, erythromycin m a r k e d l y i n h i b i t e d Q S i n v i v o a n d i n v i t r o i n A. baumannii isolates. This may be due to inhibiting the synthesis of AHL signals by erythromycin more than inhibiting signal reception. In addition, chloroquine inhibited QS in A. baumannii by inhibiting AHL signal reception more than AHL signal synthesis. Several studies performed the docking of QSIs against either LasR or RhlR of PAO1, and a significant binding potential to the active site of these proteins was revealed confirming the QS inhibitory activity [51, 53, 55] .",

            "text": "The study demonstrated that QS could control the virulence, as most of virulence factors of both PAO1 and A. baumannii clinical isolates were highly inhibited by QSIs. The most effective drug as QSIs was erythromycin. To the best of our knowledge, this study showed that antibiotics like erythromycin can inhibit QS beside their antimicrobial activity; the other tested drugs (i.e., chloroquine, levamisole, and propranolol) were studied for the first time as inhibitors for QS in A. baumannii. Results obtained from qRT-PCR, in vivo study, and molecular docking of 4 QSIs against AbaI and AbaR proteins could give a more confirmation of the mechanism of QS inhibition by the tested drugs. In addition, inhibition of QS using FDA-approved drugs present in the market is a promising strategy for inhibiting virulence without affecting microbial growth which could be used as a therapeutic alternative for traditional antibiotics. This could help in decreasing the selective pressure causing antibiotic resistance development. Future studies are needed to formulate the tested drugs in suitable dosage forms and to study their effects in vivo.",
