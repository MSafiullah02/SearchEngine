It is associated with poor outcome, with an overall mortality of 20-80% depending on the cause, the need for mechanical ventilation, the concomitant organ dysfunctions, the presence of graft-versus-host disease, and the goals of care [1, 2] . Delay in identification of the cause of ARF and the initiation of the appropriate therapy may further increase mortality. The most common cause of ARF in cancer patients is pulmonary infections, as a result of the immunosuppression posed by the underlying disease or the cancer therapy. Other frequent causes include cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), antineoplastic therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy)-induced lung injury, cancer-related medical disorders (such as venous thromboembolism, transfusionrelated acute lung injury), and direct involvement of the respiratory system by malignancy and progression of underlying disease.",

However, HRCT provides diagnostic orientation rather than a definitive diagnosis in cancer patients with ARF [6] .

Several factors increase the risk of infection in those patients, including chemotherapy, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression, multiple hospital admissions, and exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics [9] . Causative pathogen depends on the underlying immune state. In patients with impaired humoral immunity, such as those with acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myelomas, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the predominantly isolated organisms. In patients with impaired cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity as those with Hodgkin disease or those therapy with corticosteroids, the predominantly isolated organisms are Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), followed by mycobacteria, Cryptococcus, Legionella pneumophila, and viral infections (mainly herpes virus and Cytomegalovirus). Neutropenic patients are usually infected by gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae), gram-negative enteric bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae), or opportunistic fungi (mainly Aspergillus)-especially in the case of prolonged neutropenia [9, 10] . When evaluating pneumonia in patients with cancer, determining the level and the duration of immunosuppression, the previous exposure to antimicrobials (over the last month), the length of the illness, the presenting symptoms, and the radiographic pattern will better predict the suspected pathogens. Hereby we discuss the most common pulmonary infections in the immunocompromised patients.",

However, in the setting of neutropenia, clinical diagnosis is often jeopardized by nontypical clinical findings [11] . Sputum production is seen in less than 60% of neutropenic patients, while in severe neutropenia (neutrophils <1000 cells/mm 3 ), purulent sputum is present in less than 8% of patients. Routine clinical examination often reveals rales and signs of consolidation. To determinate the cause of pneumonia, blood cultures should be performed routinely; however, the results may be of limited value. Similarly, sputum analysis is often low yield, and the results are difficult to interpret. Identifying the exact cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer often requires fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL as sputum is seldom produced. The overall diagnostic yield of BAL in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients with suspected pneumonia is 49% and 63%, respectively [12] . Chest X-ray findings of bacterial pneumonia in cancer patients are nonspecific. The initial chest radiograph may be normal (mainly in neutropenic patients) or demonstrate lobar consolidation (usually missing in neutropenic patients) and diffuse interstitial infiltrates.",

The etiology of pulmonary edema is multifactorial and includes increased hydrostatic pressure from highvolume infusions and/or multiple transfusions, cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy, and renal impairment. Anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), and alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan) are chemotherapeutics drugs with well-established cardiotoxicity [36] . Even though a universally accepted definition does not exist, the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging define cancer therapeutic-related cardiac dysfunction as a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >10%, to a value <53% confirmed by repeat imaging [37] .",

BNP has a high negative predictive value, and being lower than the recommended cutoff value of 100 pg/mL in patients with suspected CPE makes the diagnosis unlikely [39] . A bedside echocardiogram in a patient with CPE remains the cornerstone in determining the etiology of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography can be used to evaluate LV systolic and diastolic function, as well as valvular function, and to assess for pericardial disease.",
