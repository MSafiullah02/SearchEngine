            "text": "CHIK infection has an important economic impact in many tropical countries, and because of the lack of specific symptoms, the infection cannot be differentiated from dengue or yellow fever [1, 9]. A CHIK fever epidemic is characterized by its sudden disappearance for a considerably long period from a particular geographic area before its resurgence. This has been well documented in the Republic of the Congo and Indonesia. However, in early 2005, a major epidemic of CHIK fever started in many Indian Ocean island nations, and in late 2005, it started spreading to several parts of India, after a hiatus of epidemic activity of nearly 32 years. This recent outbreak of CHIK infection in many parts of southern India is a point of major concern. This was the largest and most severe epidemic, affecting >1,000,000 persons in Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, and Karnataka states of southern India and spreading to several new areas, with huge public health and administrative concerns to control the epidemic [10]. Although the resurgence of CHIK fever was anticipated, this epidemic is considered to be unprecedented, owing to the magnitude of morbidity and geographical distribution. In several villages, >90% of inhabitants were found to be affected [7], with an estimated figure of 1.3 million cases to date [11]. In 2006, outbreaks of CHIK fever were reported from 194 districts in 12 states across India. The clinical manifestations of cases in the current outbreak match the known description of the disease. Analysis of the 2006 outbreak suggested that the increased severity of disease may have been associated with a change in the genetic sequence, altering the virus coat protein, which potentially allowed the virus to multiply more easily in mosquito cells [12]. Laboratory diagnosis is critical to establish the diagnosis and to initiate a specific public health response.",

A CHIK-positive viral culture, coupled with neutralization by reference serum, is taken to be definitive proof of the presence of CHIK virus.

All 132 patients who had clinically suspected CHIK virus but whose RT-PCR and RT-LAMP results were negative presented >7 days after the onset of fever; this may be the reason for the negative test results.

            "text": "The RT LAMP assay is a novel nucleic acid amplification method developed by Eiken Chemical that has the potential to replace PCR because of its simplicity, rapidity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness [14\u201316]. The RT-LAMP assay has emerged as a powerful gene amplification tool for rapid identification of microbial infections and is being increasingly used by various investigators for rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses, such as the West Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis viruses [17\u201319]. The LAMP method is cost-effective, because it requires only 1 type of DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. In the present study, the 1-step, single-tube, real-time accelerated RT-LAMP assay was standardized by targeting the immunodominant E1 gene for rapid and real-time detection of CHIK virus. In our study, the RT-LAMP assay uncovered 20 additional cases of infection, which were detected by naked eye or with a UV lamp. These samples had negative RT-PCR results, thereby proving the high sensitivity of RT-LAMP. There were a few mismatches in the RT-PCR primers (i.e., 1 base in the forward primer and 2 bases in the reverse primer), but they did not affect the test's sensitivity [20]. All of the RT-PCR\u2014positive samples also yielded positive RT-LAMP results. The RT-LAMP allows rapid, real-time detection of CHIK virus in acute-phase serum samples, without requiring sophisticated equipment, and has potential usefulness for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of CHIK virus in developing countries. Real-time quantification of the CHIK virus level can also be performed by RT\u2014LAMP with use of a loop turbidimeter. Isolation of CHIK virus from 20 of 32 RT-PCR\u2014positive clinical samples further confirmed that the infection was due to CHIK virus.",

The sequence of CHIK virus was directly determined from clinical samples without risk of altering the genome by in vitro passaging. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of these new Indian CHIK virus strains were very closely related to analogous strains from Indian Ocean island nations and that they formed a distinct clade in ECS African genotype. These new strains are reported to harbor many unique molecular features, making them more virulent and evolutionarily more competent [22]. The clustering of older Indian isolates (including the last outbreak isolates) into the Asian genotype indicates that the cause of this outbreak was the sudden introduction of the ECS genotype into the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh in southern India, rather than in situ evolution of existing strains. Because the period of our study was March\u2013December 2006, which is later than the period studied by Prasanna et al. [23] and Abu Barkar et al. [24], to the best of our knowledge (after an extensive search of the Pubmed database), we submit that this is the first report of ECS African genotype of CHIK virus as the causative agent of an unprecedented epidemic.",

Some patients (4.7%) were so disabled that they required hospitalization, but the number of such cases was negligible, and such cases mostly involved elderly patients. The chronic phase of disease resolved over a few months, extending up to 6 months. Some patients improved after receiving short-term steroid treatment. Because no specific antiviral therapy exists for CHIK infection, treatment consists of supportive care, including administration of analgesics and anti-inflammatory medication for joint symptoms. Persons with febrile illness that is suspected to be due to CHIK virus should avoid mosquito exposure for at least 7 days after the onset of illness, to reduce the likelihood of transmitting CHIK virus to local mosquitoes, which might then transmit the virus to other humans [24]. Although the number of cases being reported has decreased, this epidemic may still be continuing and spreading. Therefore, continuous surveillance is warranted to monitor the spread of infection and to track the possible evolution of the virus during the epidemic.",

Although mortality is rare or infrequent, early diagnosis and vector control will play an important role in preventing the outbreak of epidemics in the future. Intraoutbreak studies point toward recent changes in the viral genome that have facilitated the rapid spread and enhanced pathogenecity of infection [29]. The lack of herd immunity, as evidenced from available studies [30, 31], appears to be the simplest attributable factor. Also, the reasons for the current outbreak and the causes behind reemergence of the virus in India have to be further assessed. Molecular diagnosis is an important tool to identify new vectorborne viral illnesses, such as CHIK fever, at an early stage. Public health measures need to be improved to prevent such epidemics in the future. There is also an immediate need for an effective vaccine for CHIK infection.",
