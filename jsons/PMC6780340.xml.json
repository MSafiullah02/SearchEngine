In reference to asthma, an exacerbation is defined as an event characterized by change from the patient\u2019s previous status, including a progressive increase in relevant symptoms and a decrease in respiratory function. The latter can be quantified by respiratory function measurements such as peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), which when compared with the patient\u2019s previous or predicted values, reflect the deterioration in expiratory airflow, the prominent pathophysiological effect of an asthma attack.",

The physiological hallmarks of asthma are airway inflammation, airway remodeling and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) [17]. Exposure to the above-mentioned external stimuli and specifically to inhaled allergens is capable of inducing an inflammatory response in sensitized individuals and as a result to lead to exacerbations [18,19]. A hypothesis explaining this fact is that the inflammatory response resulting from inhaled allergen may drive BHR directly, or induce structural changes in the airway leading to persistent BHR [17,20]. Experimental mouse models of asthma have shown that allergen exposure protocols induce immune-mediated airway inflammation defined by: elevated levels of asthma biomarkers (IgE, the T-helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokines, interleukins (IL)-4, -5 and -13, and eosinophils), induction of airway remodeling (increases in airway smooth muscle, collagen deposition and goblet cell hyperplasia), and BHR that is sustained after the resolution of eosinophilic inflammation [21,22,23].",

According to the 2014 British Guidelines for Asthma, acute severe asthma is defined as the asthma exacerbation that presents with any of the following: PEF 33\u201350% best or predicted, respiratory rate \u2265 25/min, heart rate \u2265 110/min and inability to complete sentences in one breath [32]. The ATS/ERS task force defines a severe asthma exacerbation by the fact that they require urgent action in order to prevent a serious outcome, such as hospitalization or death from asthma [33]. This task force recommends that the definition of a severe asthma exacerbation for clinical trials should include at least one of the following: (a) use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least three days; and (b) a hospitalization or emergency department visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids. Although these definitions are not identical, the point remains that identifying this condition is important as it is correlated with worse outcomes and greater risk of needing mechanical ventilation.",

Kenyon et al. proposed the term Critical Asthma Syndromes (CAS) to identify any child or adult who is at risk of fatal asthma [34]. This term includes acute severe asthma, refractory asthma, status asthmaticus, and near fatal asthma, all of them conditions that can lead to respiratory exhaustion and arrest. Refractory asthma is, according to a definition set by the Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) consortium in 2011, patients with asthma in whom after excluding any alternative diagnoses, after treating comorbidities and removing trigger factors cannot maintain good asthma control, despite high-intensity treatment and confirmed compliance with treatment. These patients have frequent severe exacerbations (\u22652 per year), or can only be well when receiving systemic corticosteroids [35]. Near fatal asthma (NFA) is defined as an asthma exacerbation resulting in respiratory arrest requiring mechanical ventilation or a pCO2 \u2265 45 mm Hg. Some writers tend to recognize status asthmaticus and acute severe asthma as the same condition and define it mainly by its response to treatment, thus referring to it as an exacerbation that does not respond to repeated courses of \u03b22-agonist therapy [36].",

A recent study in Brazil demonstrated that urbanization has affected public health, resulting in higher asthma related morbidity and mortality, despite the fact that the urbanized population now has improved access to the health system [39]. There are no accurate figures describing the rate of acute severe asthma, but there are sufficient data regarding the asthma related hospitalizations and asthma related mortality. Recent studies estimate the risk of death of the patients who are hospitalized as a result of asthma exacerbation as less than 0.5% [40,41]. That risk is greater when the patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation, which underlines the importance of identifying and promptly treating acute severe asthma. Four percent of asthma related hospitalizations result in mechanical ventilation. There is a substantial economic burden associated with asthma hospitalizations, and it has been demonstrated that in the US in 2012 the overall cost was more than 2 billion dollars, which is a significant percentage (more than 1/3) of the annual asthma related expenditure [41]. Middle aged women are more likely to get hospitalized with asthma related morbidities [41].",

Another recent group-based trajectory analysis on patients with problematic and uncontrolled asthma, showed that near fatal events were noted in all groups, but were more frequent in patients with persistent frequent exacerbations [43]. It is not only patients with severe and poorly controlled asthma who are at risk for having an acute severe asthma exacerbation, but this has been observed as well in patients with otherwise mild or moderate asthma. The current literature describes two distinct clinico-pathophysiological entities of acute severe asthma attacks that present at the emergency department: the slow onset, late arrival and the sudden onset fatal asthma. It has been estimated that the majority (80\u201385%) of asthma-related fatalities belong to the slow onset group. These patients may have symptoms and uncontrolled disease for several days prior to the presentation with acute severe asthma. Sudden onset has been defined as severe airflow obstruction established after 1\u20133 h of symptom presentation. Barr et al. reported that patients presenting with sudden onset asthma, were more likely to have been exposed to an exacerbation trigger such as a respiratory allergen, exercise and psychosocial stress and less often respiratory infection and had greater improvement when compared with the slow onset cohort [44]. A retrospective cohort study in the United States demonstrated evidence that the sudden-onset patients were older, were more likely to present during the night and early morning hours at the emergency department, more often required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and had higher rate of ICU admission, but, on the other hand, had shorter hospital stay [45]. In this study the sudden onset cohort was only 6% of 1260 patients in 30 hospitals.",

In adults, asthma exacerbations are more often in females [46,47]. This is difficult to be explained since female asthmatics have lower levels of total serum IgE [48] and the incidence of atopy is actually lower in comparison to males [49]. A possible explanation could have to do with the connection between asthma worsening and the menses, which is a recognized contributing factor of asthma worsening [50]. Furthermore, pregnancy in asthmatic women is a condition that requires special considerations, considering the effect of the disease, as well as the medication on the mother and the fetus. Pregnancy is not always correlated with worse asthma control, although there seems to be a correlation between asthma severity and morbidities and exacerbations during pregnancy [51]. There has been reported a cluster of obese females with late-onset corticosteroid asthma with frequent exacerbations although they preserve a relatively good baseline lung function [52].",

            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are the most common triggers for a severe asthma exacerbation, comprising up to 76\u201380% of the causes of an acute asthma exacerbation in adults [81]. Human rhinovirus (RV) (types A and C), influenza virus (types A and B), para-influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are frequent causes of an acute exacerbation and hospitalization [56,82]. Coronaviruses, meta-pneumoviruses, bocaviruses, and adenoviruses may also trigger a severe acute exacerbation, however to a lesser extent [57]. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, mortality and admissions to the ICU with H1N1 infections were frequently associated with asthma [82,83]. In contrast to other respiratory viruses (i.e., RSV and Influenza Virus), RV does not exert a definite cytopathic effect [84]; instead, it compromises the function of the epithelial barrier through the release of reactive oxygen species during viral replication [85]. During this process, the induction of immune and adaptive immune response activates the synthesis and early secretion of IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and ENA-78) [86], which play a significant role in the protective mechanisms against viral infection [87,88]. There is evidence that in asthmatic patients there is dysregulated immune response against RV [89]. Several studies have demonstrated the implication of interferons in the susceptibility to asthma exacerbations in children and adults in the context of a viral respiratory infection. Miller et al. [90] showed that RV was related to asthma exacerbation with the implication of IFN III. Similarly, Jones et al. [91] documented an increased susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infections during the first years of life through dysregulated type III IFN responses, while recent studies [92,93] document a varying susceptibility to asthma exacerbations depending on the type and level of expression of cytokines and IFNs upon viral infection. Finally, Fedele et al. [94] documented that RV infection more frequently induces a Th2-mediated immune response than RSV infection, justifying the higher incidence of asthma prevalence after RV infections.",

There are bidirectional interactions between viruses and bacteria that seem to have an impact on the severity of asthma as well as the likelihood of an acute exacerbation. Viral infections facilitate the disruption of airway epithelial layers and the expression of airway receptors that bacteria use in order to invade [96]. Furthermore, in the presence of co-infection, an increased release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators is induced, heightening the burden of inflammation and predisposing to a higher risk of exacerbations [97]. Specifically, co-infections of respiratory viruses and Moraxella catarrhalis, Hemophilus influenza, and/or Streptococcus pneumonia have a greater impact on the risk for more severe acute asthma exacerbations [97]. The clarification of the mechanisms implicate the case of co-infections on inter-relationship for providing evidence for potential novel therapeutic targets that may prevent acute asthma exacerbations.",

These induce inflammatory responses, airway smooth muscle constriction, increased microvascular permeability, and mucus secretion, diminishing at the same time the innate immune responses and subsequently increasing the susceptibility to viral infections [106,107]. Of great importance is the mold sensitization, which has been associated with the phenotype of severe asthma and with severe asthma attacks. High airborne concentrations of mold have been associated with increased emergency visits for asthma exacerbations [108]. Specifically, Alternaria is associated with highly increased risk (almost 200-fold) of severe exacerbations and need for ICU admittance in both children and adults [109]. Furthermore, cockroach and mouse antigens are associated with early wheeze and atopy in an inner-city birth cohort [110].",

Hassanzad et al. demonstrated that higher cotinine levels were associated with a higher risk for severe asthma. [121]. Increasing interest has also raised on the potential hazards of third-hand smoke (THS) in children. THS is residual nicotine and other chemical pollutants remaining in the indoor environment and on household surfaces for weeks to months after active tobacco smoking has stopped. It seems that young children may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of THS exposure since they crawl and tend to ingest several items from the surrounding [122].

These cells include not only eosinophils and neutrophils, but also T-lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages and airway structural cells which are also crucially involved in the inflammatory reaction and remodeling in asthma. Although it is well accepted that asthma is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration, inflammatory phenotypes of severe asthma can be characterized by persistence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic infiltration, as well as by absence of inflammatory infiltration (paucigranulocytic) [135,136]. Depending on the type of immune cell responses implicated in disease pathogenesis, asthma endotypes are categorized as type 2 asthma, characterized predominantly by T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated inflammation and non-type 2 asthma, associated with Th1 and/or Th17 cell inflammation [137,138].

This process leads to increased production of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-17A, neutrophil elastase, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 [171]. Neutrophils are triggered by IL-8 to produce enzymes and other factors that contribute to eosinophil activity [171]. Evidence suggests that neutrophil subsets may mediate differential effects on immune surveillance and microbial killing. A variety of epithelial insults (ozone, bacteria, and viruses) induce secretion of chemokines and cytokines that promote neutrophil trafficking. Neutrophils primarily traffic to inflamed sites and then secrete granular enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and proteins to eliminate invading bacteria, fungal elements, and viruses. Undoubtedly, neutrophils play pivotal roles in innate immunity [172]. During asthma exacerbations, the presence of chemokines and cytokines (IL-8 and IL-17A) prolongs neutrophils\u2019 lifespan thus enabling them to migrate from tissue to the systemic circulation or to lymph nodes to modulate adaptive immune responses, Figure 4. The combined functions of these cytokines and activated enzymes promote airway structures to contribute to the lower FEV1, remodeling and fixed airway obstruction seen in adult patients with severe neutrophilic asthma [173].",

Hypercapnia, on the other hand, is not only present due to V/Q mismatch, but also due to respiratory muscle fatigue leading to alveolar hypoventilation. Trying to assess the exact profile of the V/Q mismatch that characterizes acute severe asthma, studies have demonstrated that although in asthma patients there is a wide spectrum of V/Q abnormalities, the most common in acute severe asthma (ASA) patients is having increased blood flow, in the context of high cardiac output, distributed in alveolar spaces with low ventilation and remarkably low V/Q ratios [199].

There is a substantial decrease in the FEV1 and the PEF of the patients, whereas the residual volume may increase as much as 400% of the normal and the functional residual capacity may even reach double the normal values [199]. In severe asthma exacerbations, total lung capacity (TLC) is also increasing. These changes in lung volumes help constricted airways remain open. During passive expiration of the lungs, the driving forces of the respiratory system are the elastic forces. The lower the elastic forces are, or the higher the resistive forces, the longer will the time needed to full expiration of the inspired tidal volume be, characteristic that may be quantified by a long expiratory time constant of the respiratory system. Incomplete exhalation of delivered tidal volume makes inspiration begin at a volume at which respiratory system exhibits a positive recoil pressure. The presence of flow at the end of the expiration is due to the presence of positive alveolar pressure at the end of expiration. This process is called dynamic hyperinflation and the positive end-expiratory alveolus pressure associated with higher relaxation volume is called intrinsic (auto) Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) [200] (Figure 5). Dynamic hyperinflation depends on the expiratory time constant, expiratory flow limitation, expiratory time, inspiratory muscle activity during exhalation, tidal volume, and external flow resistance [201]. Although this initially may act in favor of the patient, by reducing the resistive work of breathing, the thorax and lungs increase in volume, length\u2013tension relationships of the respiratory muscles shorten and the strength of contraction eventually diminishes. As the severe exacerbation remains unresponsive, expiratory and accessory muscles become active, the work of breathing increases and fatigue is a serious and potentially fatal possibility, as it further compromises respiratory function and deteriorates respiratory failure. Bronchospasm and increased resistance, mucous and compression of the peripheral airways from auto-PEEP, lead to significant heterogeneity of the lung. Normal lung units coexist with pathological lung units creating a variety of many different time constants across the lung.",

Hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, as well as mechanical ventilation due to an asthma exacerbation has been shown to significantly increase the risk for a new episode of near fatal and fatal asthma [204]. It is also very important to obtain a detailed description of the patient\u2019s medication history. Medications that play a significant role in the prediction of asthma related morbidities and death are inhaled and systematic corticosteroids, as well as the use of beta agonists. In this context, not currently using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), currently using or having recently discontinued treatment with oral corticosteroids (OCS), as well as documented overuse of short acting \u03b2 agonists (SABAs) are all factors related with an increased risk for asthma associated morbidity and mortality [205,206]. Elements from the medication history may also conceal clues that may suggest inadequate treatment, or even poor adherence to a prescribed treatment plan. The lack of a written asthma plan and socioeconomic factors are also associated with a greater risk for a severe exacerbation [207].",

Features that characterize acute severe asthma are agitation, drowsiness or signs of confusion, significant breathlessness at rest, with the patient talking in words, tachypnea of more than 30 breaths per minute, use of accessory respiratory muscles, tachycardia of >120 beats per minute and pulsus paradoxus. Moreover, it is crucial to identify signs that indicate an imminent respiratory arrest, such as paradoxical thoraco-abdominal movement, silent chest with absence of wheeze, bradycardia, while the absence of pulsus paradoxus might imply muscle fatigue [208]. Upon examining the patient with acute severe asthma, apart from recognizing the signs that indicate severity, it is imperative to diagnose any pathology that might attenuate the exacerbation and requires specific treatment. Such entities are pneumothorax and pneumo-mediastinum, and pneumonia. At the same time, the clinician needs to exclude conditions that may mimic the symptoms of an asthma attack, such as cardiogenic pulmonary edema, exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease, airway obstruction caused by a foreign body or an intraluminal mass, pulmonary embolism, hyperventilation syndrome and vocal cord dysfunction [209,210,211].",

Moreover, a value of less than 33% of their best or predicted value is an indicator of life-threatening asthma. Serial monitoring of PEF may also assist the decision of either discharging the patient, should this be accompanied with a clinical improvement, or for ICU referral if the values are continuously deteriorating despite initial appropriate treatment.

            "text": "The cornerstones of acute asthma medication are bronchodilators and especially short acting beta agonists (SABA). It is recommended that in acute severe asthma SABAs are administered repetitively or continuously. These substances activate the \u03b22 adrenoreceptors (\u03b22ARs), which are located mainly on the smooth airway muscle cells, but are also found on other airway cells even on the inflammatory cells. Their very important characteristic is that they have a rapid onset of action, while at the same time being well tolerated, despite high doses. Although the \u03b22 AR agonists are substances known for centuries, the great challenge remains improving their selectivity, in order to benefit from their desired effect, while at the same time reducing their adverse effects. All current asthma guidelines introduce short acting \u03b22 agonists (SABAs), as the first line treatment for acute severe asthma. In the first steps of escalating therapy during an exacerbation, the patient is advised to increase their use \u201cas needed\u201d. That is also the recommendation for the primary care setting, as well as for the emergency department, where repeated inhaled administration of SABA is advised. Studies on the efficacy of nebulizers vs. metered dose inhalers (MDIs) have not proven superiority of nebulized administration. In a recent review, nebulized delivery did not improve hospital admission, length of stay in the emergency department or pulmonary function [214]. According to GINA 2018, the preferred method of administration is with strong evidence (Evidence A) pMDI with a spacer [1]. This evidence becomes less strong when referring to severe and near fatal asthma. Although continuous nebulization of SABAs was initially a very promising perspective, several studies and meta-analyses have failed to clearly demonstrate strong evidence on favor of continuous nebulized SABAs for acute asthma. Rodrigo et al. in 2002 performed a systematic review and meta-analysis that showed no difference in respiratory function measured in the first hours of administration or on the rate of hospital admissions [215]. A Cochrane systematic review on the subject, including few more studies, showed significant difference on both respiratory function and hospital admissions, in favor of the continuous use of SABA, while at the same time demonstrating a good tolerance from the patients who did not present more adverse effects with this method of administration [216]. The most commonly used SABA is salbutamol or albuterol as named in the United States, which has an onset of action of less than 10 min and duration of approximately 6 h. Lebalbuterol is a recent addition to the choices of SABAs, with its benefit of a lower than salbutamol dose that provides similar effect. There is currently evidence about its efficacy in acute severe asthma as an intermittent regimen, but not as a continuous nebulization strategy [217,218]. Continuous intravenous infusion of \u03b22 agonists has also been proposed as a therapy, especially in patients who did not respond to intensive bronchodilation. There is no evidence to support the use of intravenous \u03b22 agonists [219,220] or the method of continuous, subcutaneous infusions of terbutaline [221]. Epinephrine has been studied, as a nebulized, subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, but, in current guidelines, its use is restricted for acute asthma related with anaphylaxis and angioedema [1,222,223].",

Furthermore, they enhance \u03b22-agonist-induced bronchodilation via intracellular processes and they prolong their bronchodilator effect [61,224]. The anticholinergic agent used primarily is ipratropium bromide due to its selectivity for airway smooth muscle receptors, which reduces the systemic adverse effects. Their use is included in current guidelines for moderate to severe acute and life-threatening asthma, as well as for patients who show poor response to initial SABA therapy [1,2]. It is not recommended to use anticholinergics as a single therapy for acute asthma. It has been demonstrated that the addition of inhaled ipratropium bromide to therapy with SABAs improve hospitalization rates, relapse rates and are associated with lung function improvement [62,63,64]. This combination therapy benefit is greater for the patients who present with acute severe asthma and are at a higher risk of hospitalization.

Apart from their role against asthma associated inflammation, they seem to increase the number and sensitivity of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, and also restrain the migration and function of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells. On the other hand, their lack of bronchodilatory effects prohibits their use for acute asthma as a monotherapy [74].

With regards to the root of administration, intravenous administration seems to not provide additional efficacy to the use of oral therapy [229,230]. Intramuscular regimens seem to be as effective as oral in reducing the risk for relapse [231]. The oral route is better tolerated and preferred, because it is quicker and less expensive. Identifying groups of patients where intravenous administration could be more beneficial is a recent field of study, and guidelines support that they should be considered for patients who may be unable to swallow due to breathlessness, or may not absorb efficiently the medication due to gastro-enteral disturbances, such as vomiting [1]. There is a lack of robust evidence to clarify the superiority of longer or higher dose OCS, thus the literature suggests a 5\u20137-day regimen of 50 mg prednisolone as a single dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses [1,2,232].",

Its infusion has not been correlated with severe adverse events; it is however contra-indicated for patients with renal insufficiency, hypermagnesemia and myasthenia Gravis. Magnesium has also been tried in its nebulized form for asthma exacerbation, with very few data to support it. A recent systematic review, which examined the efficacy and safety of inhaled administration of magnesium, concluded that, although safe, it has not shown significant benefits when compared with the first line inhaled agents, thus it is not routinely recommended [236]. The current literature is reluctant to fully support the use of magnesium, mainly because of the heterogeneity of the severity of asthma attacks it has been used on in trials, especially in the context of optimized first line treatment with \u03b22-agonists and corticosteroids [237]. A 2014 randomized controlled trial failed to show any evidence of clear benefit in the use of either intravenous or inhaled magnesium [238].

There is also some evidence about the use of oxygen driven nebulization with SABAs, because of the pulmonary vasodilation caused by the \u03b22-agonist, which results in increasing perfusion of poorly ventilated areas, thus resulting in deterioration of the V/Q abnormalities [246].",

In the context of asthma, there are no large randomized trials to examine its effect.

            "text": "The decision to intubate and mechanically ventilate a patient with acute asthma exacerbation is a clinical one and may be made urgently. When the clinician decides that respiratory failure is progressing, and is unlikely to be reversed by further pharmacologic therapy, intubation should be performed as quickly as possible by a skilled intensivist or anesthesiologist, who has extensive experience in intubation and airway management, using rapid sequence intubation (RSI) protocol suitable for asthmatic patients (good preparation, sufficient pre-oxygenation, suitable induction to anesthesia agents suitable for asthma, and placement of the endotracheal tube) [259]. Regarding the preferred method of intubation, oral endotracheal intubation is preferred, although the literature also includes awake nasotracheal intubation, which may be complicated by the fact that many asthmatic patients also have nasal polyps [203]. Additionally, oral intubation allows the use of an endotracheal tube of a larger diameter, facilitating secretion removal and bronchoscopy, if needed, while at the same time decreasing inspiratory airway resistance. It should be noted that unlike other conditions in which intubation and mechanical ventilation can solve problems, the dynamic hyperinflation that mechanical ventilation can create or even exacerbate can have devastating consequences for a severe asthmatic patient, such as cardiovascular collapse and/or barotrauma and ventilator induced lung injury. Therefore, there are certain considerations to be made before and during RSI. During RSI in such patients one should anticipate rapid oxygen desaturation despite maximal effort at pre-oxygenation especially in those patients who do not achieve a SpO2 above 93%, so adequate pre-oxygenation is advised. Bag mask ventilation should be done using small tidal volume and high inspiratory flow rate with a prolonged expiratory phase, attempting with this way to mimic the approach used during mechanical ventilation. Excessive mag mask ventilation should be avoided because of the risk of pneumothorax [260,261]. Manipulation of the airway can cause laryngospasm and worsening of bronchoconstriction, so one could consider the use of atropine to attenuate vagal reflexes [203]. The literature suggests the bolus use of intravenous ketamine for RSI taking advantage of its bronchodilatory effect, while propofol is also considered a safe approach. Opiates and barbiturates should be avoided due to the risk of histamine release that can exacerbate bronchoconstriction [262]. If muscle relaxants are needed, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (except maybe atracurium and mivacurium) and succinylcholine are suitable in asthmatic patients [263].",

The aim of mechanical ventilation is to maintain adequate oxygenation, to reduce the work of breathing and to prevent and confront further hyperinflation without any circulatory compromise or ventilator induced lung injury [264]. The intubation and post-intubation period is often complicated with severe cardio-respiratory derangement. Hypotension, the most common post-intubation complication, may be caused due to dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP, and can be aggravated by dehydration, sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents. Arrhythmias, barotraumas, laryngospasm or even seizures have also characterized the post-intubation period [265,266]. Phenomena such as hypercapnia, hypoxemia and acidemia, as well as ventilatory lung injury and life threatening pneumotrauma (pneumothorax and pneumo-mediastinum), may also complicate the post-intubation period. Reasons for the aforementioned may be the severity and non-responsiveness of the disease, but may also be the result of inadequate sedation or patient\u2013ventilator desynchrony. Wrong and harmful initial ventilator settings may also result in providing too little or too excessive minute ventilation, potentially deteriorating the already very fragile asthmatic patient [267].",

Although there is no clear evidence to support the volume-preset over the pressure-preset modes, the preferred ventilator modes for the asthmatic patient are the volume-limited ones [263]. Barotrauma seems to occur regardless of the mode of ventilation. Volume-limited modes of ventilation are usually used for near death asthmatic patients at their entrance in the ICU. It is essential to closely monitor the Peak inspiratory and Plateau pressures, to early detect any change in resistance and compliance, and this is easily achievable when using volume modes (Figure 8). Although high inspiratory flow rates of 80 L/min up to 100 L/min and square waveforms shorten inspiratory time and increase expiration time, thus reducing hyperinflation, it has been shown that this may not have a significant impact to the degree of hyperinflation once the minute ventilation has been limited by high peak inspiratory pressure [271]. Minute ventilation should be set at a level of less than 115 mL/kg/min (less than 10 L/min) with a respiratory rate of 10\u201312 breaths/min and a prolonged expiratory time by decreasing I:E ratio (1:3 or 1:4 up to 1:5) [263,266]. Tuxen and Lane showed a remarkable increase in hyperinflation when using higher levels of minute ventilation [120]. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) should be titrated to maintain the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 90% (up to 94%) or the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) above 60 mmHg. One should avoid SpO2 > 96% due to oxygen toxicity (Table 4).",

The use of progressively higher external PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH2O has been shown to have a deteriorating effect both in respiratory (deterioration of the end-inspiratory volume, the functional residual capacity and plateau pressure) and circulatory system (decrease of systolic arterial pressure and cardiac output) [271]. In one prospective study of patients undergoing control mode of ventilation, external PEEP worsened hyperinflation and had serious hemodynamic effects by worsening gas trapping [272]. On the other hand, other studies have shown that the application of external PEEP, may produce a paradoxical lung deflation by reducing lung volumes and airway pressures and increasing lung homogeneity [273]. In the case of assist mode of mechanical ventilation, the application of external PEEP at a value less than 80% of the intrinsic PEEP, or 5 cm H2O if intrinsic PEEP is <10 cm H2O can counterbalance the endogenous peep and reduce the work of breathing [274]. A trial of stepwise increase in PEEP can be used and terminated when indications of worsening of dynamic hyperinflation it is shown.",

PaCO2 levels up to 60 mmHg and pH values less than 7.20 are common on the first day of mechanical ventilation even with increased minute ventilation. The term permissive hypercapnia is a ventilating strategy that can be applied to mechanically ventilated asthma patients, that emphasizes on giving priority to the reduction of hyperinflation rather than normal minute ventilation. The reduction of minute ventilation through reduction of tidal volume and respiratory rate is used to decrease pulmonary hyperinflation. PaCO2 levels should rise gradually during mechanical ventilation rather than rapidly, preferably at a rate of <10 mmHg per hour or even slower if the PaCO2 exceeds 80 mmHg. Generally, a pH level of 7.20\u20137.25 is accepted, but the literature has failed to demonstrate a benefit from using alcalotic agents, such as bicarbonate infusion to accomplish that [274].",

Although evidence based on clinical trials for the use of ECMO in asthmatic patients is lacking [277,278], there is growing evidence on the subject, supporting the use of ECLS for patients receiving mechanical ventilation due to an asthmatic exacerbation. A 2009 review by Mikkelsen et al. has demonstrated that, when ECLS is used for status asthmaticus, it correlates with better outcomes in comparison to its use for other causes of respiratory failure [279]. In this study, they used data from the multicenter Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), but included only a small number of patients. In 2017, there was another review of the same database, confirming that the use of ECMO is an acceptable option, and resulted in acceptable survival rates, although it is necessary to understand and reduce the ECMO related complications [280]. Di Lascio et al., using ECMO for asthmatic patients receiving IMV, showed that it could provide adjunctive pulmonary support for patients who remain severely acidotic and hypercapnic despite aggressive conventional therapy [281]. The writers conclude that ECMO should be considered as an early treatment in patients with status asthmaticus whose gas exchange is not satisfactory despite using conventional therapy, aiming to provide adequate gas change and to prevent ventilator induced lung injury.",

In a difficult to safely ventilate asthmatic patient, due to extremely high airway pressures, hypoventilation and persistent severe respiratory acidemia are common issues. The usage of ECCO2R, considering the reversibility of the pathophysiology of asthma, provide the opportunity for more protective ventilation and more time for the bronchodilator agents to act and reverse inflammation and hyperinflation. There is no sufficient evidence to support a clear role of this technique in asthmatic patients, but there seems to be a growing interest on the subject [282,283]. Schneider et al. even presented a case where ECCO2R was used in an \u201cawake\u201d patient with a near fatal asthma attack, refractory to the use of pharmacological intervention and NIMV, resulting in avoidance of intubation [284].

It is important to distinguish between asthma that is difficult to control and asthma that is truly severe. Severe asthma is defined by the joint European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines according to the following criteria [151]:Requirement for treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to maintain control.Refractory to the treatment mentioned above.Incomplete management of comorbidities such as severe sinus disease or obesity.",

The currently approved add-on biological treatments for severe asthma include anti-IgE treatment for severe allergic asthma (omalizumab), anti-IL5 or anti-IL5R for severe eosinophilic (mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab), and anti-IL4R for severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma or patients requiring maintenance OCS asthma (dupilumab) (Table 6).",

Asthma patients experience exacerbations irrespective of underlying disease severity, phenotype, or despite optimal guideline-directed treatment, as a result of the ongoing inflammatory processes and loss of the disease control. Patients with frequent emergency department visits, patients requiring hospitalization, and, more importantly, patients intubated for an asthma exacerbation are at significantly increased risk for future severe exacerbations. It is evident that prevention of exacerbations remains a major unmet need in asthma management. The identification of patients at risk to have severe exacerbations is of paramount importance. Patient education and written plans of management, control of triggering/risk factors and co-morbid conditions, monitoring of asthma control and pulmonary function as well as optimal pharmacotherapy are needed to prevent and/or decrease exacerbations. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations will ultimately lead to better strategies and the development of novel treatments in the pursuit of preventing and treating severe asthma exacerbations.",
