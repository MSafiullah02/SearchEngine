The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging countries to improve efforts to contain the disease and protect healthcare workers and notes that a solution calls for 'aggressive preparedness', all around the world [1, 2]. On 11 March 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2]. Healthcare systems around the world are operating at, or preparing to operate at, above usual capacity, and significant adjustments in surgical services will be required. It presents challenging choices about whether aesthetic surgical care can and should be delayed or reprioritized, with the immediate goal of minimizing exposure risk for frontline healthcare providers and vulnerable patients [2]. International healthcare systems have variable environments, with conditions differing significantly by locality [3, 4]. Critical decisions concerning the deployment of resources and the management of elective aesthetic surgical procedures should be made based on institutional policies and recommendations from local, national and international authorities, considering the availability of finite and essential resources [5, 6].",

National and international aesthetic surgery societies should provide their members with the most up-to-date, thorough and correct expert information to use in making decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and care for aesthetic surgery patients [8, 13, 16]. National and international aesthetic surgery societies should not only explore a variety of opportunities of safe practice while following all the prescribed guidelines in current COVID-19 pandemic but more importantly endeavour to present a well-organized, constantly updated summary of COVID-19 management of aesthetic patients during the pandemic with emphasis on safe practice methods for patients and providers [17\u201319].",
