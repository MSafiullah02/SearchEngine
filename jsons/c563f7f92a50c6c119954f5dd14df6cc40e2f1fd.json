The computation of the values to assess a screening test was presented in chapter \"Descriptive Epidemiological Methods.\" Criteria that should be considered when choosing a screening test follow principles presented in chapter \"Epidemiological Study Another approach to evaluating the accuracy of a screening test is to prepare a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This graphical technique is used when test measures are ordinal and the outcome (disease) measure is nominal, a likelihood ratio (LR) for each level of the test is computed and the area under a ROC curve is used to assess criterion validity. An ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) vs. the false positive rate (1-specificity) for each level of the test. The test level where an LR of 1.0 is exceeded is defined as the threshold for positivity or the cut point at which the value for the test will significantly predict the outcome. Statistical software is available to easily construct LRs and ROC curves using statistical software such as SPSS Inc.'s Predictive Analytic Software portfolio (http:// ww.spss.com). The greater the area under the curve (AUC), the greater is the accuracy of the test measure in predicting the outcome represented by AUC = 1, perfect prediction and where AUC = 0.5 is random prediction.

Response by the health system includes communication of risk identified from surveillance to the public, introduction of countermeasures such as recall of products, treatment of individuals who could transmit the disease, or the administration of immunizations. Surveillance can focus on the identification of: awareness of specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke events), behavioral risk factors (factors leading to the increased risk of a health problem because of an action or task) (e.g., needlestick injury surveillance, adverse drug events), birth defects, chronic diseases, clinical syndromes clustering (because of their potential for bioterrorism), dental caries, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), infectious diseases, indicators of the potential for infectious diseases in humans (e.g., surveillance of dead birds in identifying emergence of West Nile Virus), injuries, preventive service utilization, procedure utilization (e.g., assisted reproductive technology), and health problems whose prevalence is expected to markedly increase over time (e.g., epilepsy) (Centers for Disease Control, 2008; Chowdhury et al., 2007; Pelletier et al., 2005; Piriyawat et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2008; Zahran et al., 2005) , and other health problems (e.g., nonfatal maltreatment of infants). The process of surveillance begins with the definition of the \"case.\" A case is initially defined by what is unusual about the disease, usually clinically by a set of signs and symptoms and their onset focused on unusual findings (e.g., mid-lobe lung consolidation pneumonia-like presentation on chest X-rays in SARS cases) and related to some common exposure (e.g., travel to a location where other known cases were identified). The case definition can then be further refined clinically (i.e., fewer signs and symptoms) or through expanded suspicions of a common cause or \"exposure.\" Relevant screening laboratory tests of the cases are then followed up with confirmatory diagnostic testing. The more homogenous the clinical presentation, the more likely a common source of exposure can be identified. A Lyme disease case, one of the most rapidly increasing incidence rates of vectorborne diseases in the USA, is defined for surveillance purposes by the presence of a rash (erythema migrans), clinical signs (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurologic), and laboratory determination of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi in consideration of exposure to areas with infected ticks (Bacon et al., 2008) . In addition to clinical and laboratory criteria for defining a case, epidemiologic criteria may be utilized as was with the surveillance case definition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Epidemiologic criteria for SARS included one or more of the following exposures in the 10 days before onset of symptoms: Travel to a foreign or domestic location with documented or suspected recent transmission of SARS or close contact with a person with mild-tomoderate or severe respiratory illness and with history of travel in the 10 days before onset of symptoms to a foreign or domestic location with documented or suspected recent transmission of SARS (CDC, 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1369, "end": 1383, "text": "Control, 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1407, "text": "Chowdhury et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1431, "text": "Pelletier et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1455, "text": "Piriyawat et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1476, "text": "Wright et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1497, "text": "Zahran et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2752, "end": 2772, "text": "(Bacon et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3443, "text": "(CDC, 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Surveillance"}, {"text": "Surveillance methodology for collecting data on confirmed or possible cases and other relating information can be accomplished through field surveys, reports of notifiable conditions from laboratories and health care providers to public health authorities, or review of existing databases or records.

Cases are identified from laboratory results, admissions records to hospitals or emergency departments, radiology reports, outpatient facilities, or doctor's office's logs or billing records of presenting complaints. Active surveillance involves the process of screening, namely, locating cases with signs and symptoms that meet well-defined criteria related to a diagnosis, or proxies of human cases. Active surveillance is directed at determining if changing risk factors or more toxigenic strains are emerging which may impact communities and health care settings and to attempt to prevent through rapid case identification the spread (Lindsey et al., 2008; Rabatsky-Ehr et al., 2008) . Active surveillance for a condition similar to WNV involves collecting weekly information on the presence of this arbovirus in humans, animals, and mosquitos. Compiled data by state health departments are communicated to the CDC through a web-based system based upon reports from: (1) health care providers and clinical laboratories regarding human cases of WNV disease, (2) WNV presumption blood donors from blood collection agencies, (3) the testing of dead birds, (4) veterinarians to collect reports of WNV infection in nonhuman mammals, and (5) mosquitoes (Lindsey et al., 2008) . Although typically identified as an essential component of public health practice for the control of transmissible diseases, the value of surveillance for noninfectious health problems is increasingly utilized in health services settings. For example, surveillance is an intervention utilized by nurses in the prevention of falls through the documentation of risk factors (e.g., physical impairments, cognitive impairments, inability to walk independently, incontinence, and use of certain medications such as diazepam, etc.) at admission and then monitoring these risk factors through the collection and monitoring clinical information throughout the course of the hospital stay. However, as with any active surveillance activities, the cost of the system needs to be considered relative to the resultant cost savings from the control or prevention of the outcome under surveillance (Klaucke et al., 1988; Shever et al., 2008) . Thus, increasing the effectiveness of nursing intervention for surveillance for fall prevention may result in higher costs if more nursing staff would be required. Two types of active surveillance are enhanced surveillance and syndrome surveillance. Enhanced surveillance is a type of active surveillance involving the prospective detection and simultaneous aggressive follow-up of reports of newly identified persons meeting the case definition of the disease to investigate. Enhanced surveillance: (1) focuses on the collection of accurate risk factor information, (2) guides prevention efforts, and (3) ensures referral to appropriate treatment Exposure to radioactive chemicals, X-rays, or other radiation source for cases and their contacts. This type of surveillance is commonly activated when clusters of disease are identified or reported emerge and rapid response by public health agencies is likely (Leuchner et al., 2008) . The early identification of epidemics of contagious diseases commonly relies on the presentation of syndrome clusters is termed syndromic surveillance (Table 5) . A syndrome is the grouping of nonspecific general conditions commonly representing the early symptoms of a disease. Chief complaints of selected conditions of public health concern, upon presentation during the registration process, most commonly to the emergency room. The chief complaints are then scored or coded, typically by a software package, to be assigned and grouped to syndrome category. This is of particular importance as the detecting of these clusters of symptoms can provide an early warning of a major epidemic of transmissible diseases or bio-chemicalradiological terror attack. Thus, syndrome surveillance is viewed as a type of active surveillance. The identification of certain syndromes would trigger reporting to public health officials. Data for the identification of syndromes through active surveillance can come from emergency rooms, STD programs, lead poising prevention programs, vital records, immunization programs, ambulance calls, pharmacy medication sales of prescription and over the counter medications, and linked demographic, outpatient pharmacy claims, physician and facility claims. Syndromic surveillance can be used to estimate the burden of disease in a community, recognizing that only a limited number of persons may come in contact with the health care system to be identified. The source of the disease could be human, exposures, or from environmental sources (Cryptosporidium contamination of water). Because it is a type of active surveillance, it may be a more rapid and hence efficient and effective means of providing data to prioritize the direction of field investigations as to a potential cause. It is estimated that for every flu-like illness presenting in an emergency room, 60 illnesses may occur among residents; every visit for diarrheal illness may represent 251 illnesses in the community (Metzger et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 838, "end": 860, "text": "(Lindsey et al., 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 861, "end": 887, "text": "Rabatsky-Ehr et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1473, "text": "(Lindsey et al., 2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2382, "text": "(Klaucke et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2403, "text": "Shever et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3315, "end": 3338, "text": "(Leuchner et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 5356, "end": 5378, "text": "(Metzger et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3492, "end": 3501, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Active Surveillance"}, {"text": "Passive surveillance requires that the case has already been identified through diagnosis and/or coding or databases (see Boxed Example 2).

The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (see chapter \"Health Risks from the Environment: Challenges to Health Services Delivery\") is an example of passive surveillance. States provide weekly reports of notifiable disease to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The specific diseases and conditions that are notifiable are determined by the states and territories and reported information includes: the date identified, the location of the diagnosis, demographics of the case, and data specifically related to the disease/condition. Passive surveillance can be conducted using existing datasets when the data on cases within it have been validated. For example, population-based surveillance of HRQoL is conducted as a means of promoting the health and quality of life of US residents and monitoring progress toward two Healthy People 2010 goals, (1) increase the quality and years of healthy life and (2) eliminate disparities (Zahran et al., 2005) . The HRQoL data used are from validated items collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System using the measures of self-rated health and within the preceding 30 days, number of physically unhealthy days, number of mentally unhealthy days, and days of activity limitation. Passive surveillance can also be conducted through mapping strategies including those using global positioning systems coupled with geographic information systems form a new epidemiologic technique called geographic surveillance. As cases occur, they are assigned a coordinate for mapping purposes. The use of spatial statistics associated with these graphical techniques adds a new dimension of identifying significantly elevated numbers of cases in geographic areas that could be useful in identifying both infectious and noninfectious cases (Blumenstock et al., 2000; Roche et al., 2002) . Various spatial statistics also determine if attribute values form a clustered, uniform, or random pattern across a region. Cluster analysis determining the location of the center of the data, the shape or orientation of the data, and the dispersion of the data may be evaluated using spatial statistical software such as ArcGIS (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA) and Spatial Statistics Toolbox for Matlab 2.0 (MathWorks, Inc.

These criteria apply regardless of the health condition is transmissible, chronic, or another health problem (e.g., abuse). Sensitivity is the ability to accurately identify cases both in terms of diagnostic accuracy as well as the total count of the cases and their severity. Hence, sensitivity is essential to establishing the validity of the measurement of the phenomena under surveillance (see also chapter \"Measurement Issues in the Use of Epidemiologic Data\"). To assess if the criterion of sensitivity is met, the following questions should be asked: (1) Are reporting laboratories following appropriate protocols, including quality assurance, for testing? (2) Are providers following guidelines for the clinical spectrum for the definition of cases? (3) Can potential cases access the health care system to come to diagnostic attention, or will cases have to be identified through field surveys (e.g., contacting exposed persons by telephone)? Sensitivity of the system is also a function of the timeliness and completeness of reporting Representativeness is the assurance that all possible sources of data from which a case could be ascertained are funneled in to the surveillance system (e.g., for sexually transmitted disease [STD]: from STD clinics, prenatal clinics, prisons, etc.) and if these sources can accurately capture the projected incidence of the health event in the target population. Timeliness is defined as how quickly the cases are identified, specimens are transmitted for analysis, results transmitted to a central repository for analysis, and reports are prepared and disseminated. Increasingly, health departments are seeking to arrange for reporting through electronic means. Overhage et al. (2008) found that automated electronic laboratory reporting identified 4.4 times more cases and 7.9 days earlier compared with traditional spontaneous, paper-based methods or by postmail. Timely identification and reporting of cases, particularly within the disease-specific incubation period, is critical to not only accurately identify all cases, but also to capture information accurately about exposures, and implementation control measures quickly. Electronic reporting can also enhance the completeness of reporting to the health department and then support more focused investigation of the cases (Kit-Powell et al., 2008) . Simplicity of the system is essential in order for staff as well as the population under surveillance and is a criterion which refers to both the structure as well as the processes. Less time is spent in staff training, formatting databases for analysis, and the timely distribution of information. Less error is generated with simple forms by increasing compliance with collecting and recording (see also chapter \"Advancing Patient Safety Through the Practice of Managerial Epidemiology\"). Flexibility is the ability to accommodate and adapt to new and different diseases or health conditions because of variations in case definition, reporting sources, testing protocols, or exposures. Automated electronic reporting systems can also meet the criteria of simplicity and flexibility with entry of information directly onto computer screens and into computer databases which can be modified with ease. Acceptability is the level of participation individual practitioners (health care providers and public health), health care organizations, and labs are willing to engage in regarding ascertaining cases and reporting them. Concerns regarding measures to ensure confidentiality of the case, time involved in reporting, who assumes the cost of case finding, and liability may affect reporting. The reader is advised to consult and be familiar with federal and state laws and guidelines on the collection, storage, and use of protected health information which may change over time. The Centers for Disease Control (2003) is an important source of guidance regarding the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Public Health. The PPV of a surveillance system (or a screening or diagnostic test) is the proportion of individuals identified as a case who actually do have the condition under surveillance (or who are positive to screening and who have the condition targeted for screening) (see also Table 4 of chapter \"Measurement Issues in the Use of Epidemiologic Data\"). The value of the PPV is a function of all the preceding quality elements of a surveillance system. The higher the PPV, the less likely that there are false leads in accurately characterizing an epidemic and more efficient deployment of resources in control measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 199, "text": "(Klaucke et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1496, "text": "[STD]: from STD clinics, prenatal clinics, prisons, etc.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1933, "text": "Overhage et al.

Incidence surveillance for HIV infection has been adopted as a component of the existing national HIV/AIDS reporting system which covers 22 states. The ability to identify new from long-standing cases of HIV-infection aids in determining if there has been a shift in population subgroups at risk because of changes in risk factor patterns and if disparities in health care or access to health care. The new system confirmed that the majority of new cases (72%) continued to be among men having sex with men. The HIV incident surveillance system has identified an increasing disparity in the incidence of HIV. The rate among black males 13-29 years was found to be 7.1 times higher than comparable age white males. Among black females, the incidence rate was 14 times the rate in white females (Prejean et al., 2008) . These data stress the need for both more preventive efforts as well as improving access to care for high risk groups. Syndromic surveillance has been found particularly useful in detecting and monitoring annual outbreaks of influenza, norovirus, and rotavirus (Balter et al., 2005) . Syndromic surveillance systems in \"high-profile\" urban areas can also provide a reassurance during heightened terror or other security alert situations to provide reassurance to the public that a certain condition or exposure (e.g., anthrax) is not present. Chronic disease surveillance in the USA utilizes 92 indicators from nine data sources (Pelletier et al., 2005) .

The delay in reporting may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a disease outbreak as a diagnosis may take days to weeks. Knowledge of the type of surveillance systems upon which decisions are made may aid in planning the timing of the deployment of system health care resources when surge capacity is needed. To address all these challenges, the next generation of surveillance systems for notifiable disease called the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) will integrate the various reporting sources (labs, public) with clinical databases from hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms that are secured by Health Level Seven American National Standards Institute (HL7) security protocols for protected health information as well as an interface of automated grouping software (for syndromes), statistical and geospatial analysis (see Fig. 3 ). HL7 covers how messaging transactions regarding patient information to various data repositories are transmitted, authenticated, and determined to be complete and accurate (Edwards, 2008 ). This new system architecture will facilitate real-time surveillance and the early detection of outbreaks. The eventual integration of databases from outside the hospital setting, such as from pharmacies, is critical. Lack of access to health care and/or lack of health care insurance may prompt individuals to self-care/medications (e.g., purchase of over-the-counter antidiarrheals, cold remedies at pharmacies) or seek no care thereby missing and underestimating emerging diseases in some communities. The early detection of outbreaks through the integration of administrative data, public health data, laboratory data, and public/provider reporting through surveillance is an important strategy not only for preventing widespread disease outbreaks but also for combating infectious disease resistance to antibiotics through implementing control measures earlier when the first signs of increased statistical trends in diseases of public health importance emerge.
