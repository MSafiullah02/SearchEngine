For example, during the period between November 23, 2018 to February 2, 2019, the overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against all influenza virus infection associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness was 47%. For children aged 6 months to 17 years, the overall vaccine effectiveness was 61% (1). In addition, a growing body of evidence indicates that the protective immune responses triggered by flu vaccines wane in a matter of weeks (2). Antiviral drugs thus form an important part of an effective approach to influenza and are critical to planning for a pandemic (3).",

Decreasing the inhaled dose by a factor of 10 to 20, 3 doses per day inhaled buformin could be administered at 5 to 10 mg per dose, much less than metformin. This dose of buformin, 15 to 30 mg per day, would be highly unlikely to produce lactic acidosis, the main biguanide complication. In a previous study, the toxic oral buformin dose was 329\u00b130 mg/day in 24 patients who developed lactic acidosis while using buformin. Another group of 24 patients administered 258\u00b125 mg/day buformin did not develop lactic acidosis (25). In other words, the inhaled buformin dose can be increased 10-fold above what would be needed to treat influenza and would still be well below the systemic toxic dose (Fig. 3).
