The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued a guideline which includes a risk stratification system for patients needing radiation to help in making management decisions.[7] When radiation therapy is indicated, efforts should be made to reduce the number of treatment fractions delivered. Reducing the number of patients receiving radiation therapy, as well as the number of treatments received, is critically important during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only to benefit the patient being treated, but also for a number of other reasons beyond the individual benefit. First, it minimizes exposure and risk of all patients and staff to the virus. Second, radiation therapy, especially when delivered concurrently with chemotherapy, may cause lymphopenia which is likely to persist over the course of therapy, resulting in immunosuppression and thus increased susceptibility to the virus. This can be minimized with shorter treatment courses, or sequential versus concurrent chemo-radiation therapy (CRT). Finally, each time a COVID-19-positive patient is treated, treatment rooms and machines must be decontaminated, resulting in over-utilization of resources, currently in limited supply.",

Based on the CROSS trial, 41.4Gy in 23 fractions with concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel is preferred.[11] In centers where staffing is particularly limited, and in which minimizing the number of fractions is of critical importance, the Walsh regimen of 40Gy in 15 fractions can be considered.[12] However, concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel or FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin)[13] is preferred.b.Induction chemotherapy: To delay the initiation of daily radiotherapy in centers were these facilities may be strained for staff and resources, induction chemotherapy can be considered prior to CRT.[14], [15], [16], [17] It should be noted that this was a controversial recommendation, not supported by all authors, based on data from the CALGB 80803 trial, which has only been published in abstract form. CALGB 80803 demonstrated feasibility and promising outcomes for patients undergoing PET-directed therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma with treatment based on response after 6 weeks of induction FOLFOX or carboplatin and paclitaxel.[18].c.Surgery: Patients should undergo re-staging scans and be referred for surgery 6-8 weeks after completion of CRT in centers where surgery can still be performed. In centers where surgical procedures have been discontinued for the forseeable future due to the COVID-19 crisis, management should follow that of inoperable esophageal cancer (see below). If there has been a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant treatment, consider close follow-up with surgery reserved for salvage. For patients with squamous cell histology, consider CRT alone, without surgery, based on the 49% pathological complete response rate in the CROSS trial.[11]\n\n3.Inoperable esophageal cancer:a.Definitive CRT: For inoperable patients, the maximum dose of radiation should not exceed 50Gy in 25 fractions, as higher doses are ineffective and may even be detrimental.[19], [20] Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel is the preferred concurrent chemotherapy regimen due to only once weekly administration. Concurrent FOLFOX is another good option due to administration every 2 weeks.[13] For centers where radiation facilities are particularly strained, 40Gy in 15 fractions can be considered. This should be followed by 2 cycles of chemotherapy (with fluorouracil and cisplatin) as per RTOG 85-01.[21], [22]\n\n4.Definitive RT: Patients who are not suitable for chemotherapy can receive RT with a hypofractionated regimen of either 50Gy in either 16 or 20 fractions.[23] It should be noted that this recommendation was somewhat controversial among authors due to concerns over the potential for increased late toxicity.5.Advanced disease:\n",

While 30Gy in 10 fractions is a common palliative regimen, shorter courses such as 6-8Gy in a single fraction for pain or bleeding, or 20Gy in 5 fractions for dypshagia, can be used to minimize patient visits to the clinic.[24], [25]\n",

Further, radiation in this context can allow for local disease control until the tumor can be resected. As with SBRT for other gastrointestinal sites, we recommend use of non-invasive procedures for tumor localization and tracking at this time (4DCT, abdominal compression, biliary stents as surrogate markers) for centers that typically use fiducials for localization.",
