Jeang Foundation, a philanthropic charity based in Houston, Texas, which has provided scholarships at Houston schools, the University of Arizona, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Previous winners of the Retrovirology Prize include Stephen Goff, Joseph Sodroski, Karen Beemon, Ben Berkout, Thierry Heidmann [2], and Michael Malim [3]. Annually, the Retrovirology Prize recognizes an outstanding mid-career scientist who is at the height of his/her scientific productivity and who is expected to have many future years of high achievement. In even numbered years, the Prize is awarded to an HIV virologist, in odd numbered years it is for a non-HIV retrovirologist.",

            "text": "For 2011, the Editors of Retrovirology have selected Masao Matsuoka as the recipient of the Retrovirology Prize (Figure 1). Professor Masao Matsuoka is a physician by training and an oncologist by medical specialty. He graduated from Kumamoto University School of Medicine and did a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California Berkeley before returning to Japan where he currently is the Professor and Director of the Institute for Virus Research at Kyoto University. For the past 25 years, Matsuoka has been a pioneer and a leading figure in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) research. He has made many important discoveries with two particularly notable findings. HTLV-1 infection frequently becomes latent, and one of the major puzzles in the field is how this occurs. Matsuoka's seminal contribution here is his discovery that the 5' LTR DNA sequence of the HTLV-1 provirus is preferentially methylated while the 3' LTR of the provirus is not. His work in this area is independent of and contemporaneous with similar observations made in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) research and has added to our insights on how retroviral latency is achieved and how it might be thwarted by employing targeted therapeutic agents.",

HIV-1 researchers have long ago discounted the importance of a 3' LTR driven antisense transcript. Yet, in the last decade, independent results from Mesnard (France) and Matsuoka (Japan) have strongly established the existence and biological importance of an HTLV-1 antisense transcript called HBZ. The HBZ RNA encoded by the minus strand of the provirus is capable of encoding a bZIP protein, and Matsuoka and his colleagues have shown that this RNA and its protein are expressed in all Adult T-cell leukemias (ATLs). Importantly, Matsuoka is the first to demonstrate that the expression of HBZ promotes the proliferation of T cells, and he has reported that HBZ expressing transgenic mice develop T cell lymphomas.",

However, now I spend much more time for my research in Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University. My past background is good experience for me since I can appreciate different points of view for retrovirology. Actually, I think understanding how the virus induces various clinical conditions (inflammation, hypercalcemia, immunodeficiency, etc.) from virological and clinical points of view provide informed and synergistic perspectives.
