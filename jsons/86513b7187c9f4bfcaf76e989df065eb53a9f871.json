Specifically, the hypothesis was that the use of a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distributions instead of Gaussian distributions would be beneficial because of the focus on cosine distances of both VMF and the vector space model traditionally used in information retrieval. Previous experiments had validated this hypothesis. Our replication was not able to validate it, despite a large parameter scan space.",

In information retrieval (IR), \"traditional\" models remain a high baseline to beat, particularly when considering efficiency in addition to effectiveness [6] . Combining the word embedding models with the traditional IR models is therefore very attractive and several papers have attempted to improve the baseline by adding in, in a more or less ad-hoc fashion, word-embedding information. Onal et al. [10] summarized the various developments of the last half-decade in the field of neural IR and group the methods in two categories: aggregate and learn. The first one, also known as compositional distributional semantics, starts from term representations and uses some function to combine them into a document representation (a simple example is a weighted sum). The second method uses the word embedding as a first layer of another neural network to output a document representation.",

The results of our experiments, for d = 50 and 100-dimensional feature vectors, are summarised in Table 1 . For all the methods, we perform a parameter scan of the (inverse) regularisation strength of the logistic regression classifier, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) . Additionally, the learning algorithms are trained for a different number of epochs and the resulting classification accuracy assessed, cf. Fig. 1(c) and (d). Figure 1 (a) indicates that cBow, FV-GMM, FV-moVMF, and the simple TF-IDF, when properly tuned, exhibit a very similar accuracy on subj -the given confidence intervals do not indeed allow us to identify a single, best model. Surprisingly, TF-IDF outperforms all the others on the sent dataset ( Fig. 1(b) ). Increasing the dimensionality of the feature vectors, from d = 50 to 100, has the effect of reducing the gap between TF-IDF and the rest of the models on the sent dataset (see Table 1 ).",

We experimented with three topic processing ways: (1) title only, (2) description only, and (3) title and description. The third way produces the best results and closest to the ones reported by Zhang et al. [14] , and hence are the only ones reported here. An important aspect of BM25 is the fact that the variation of its parameters k 1 and b could bring significant improvement in performance, as reported by Lipani et al. [8] . Therefore, we performed a parameter scan for k 1 \u2208 [0, 3] and b \u2208 [0, 1] with a 0.05 step size for both parameters. For every TREC topic, the scores of the top 1000 documents retrieved from BM25 were normalised to [0,1] with the min-max normalisation method, and were used in calculating the scores of the documents for the combined models [14] .",

The situation is rather different when considering the effectiveness of these document representations for clustering purposes: we find indeed that the FV-moVMF significantly underperforms, contradicting previous conclusions.
