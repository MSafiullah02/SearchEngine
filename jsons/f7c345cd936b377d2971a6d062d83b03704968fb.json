            "text": "The entry of microorganisms into the body induces an inflammatory reaction. The strength of this reaction is a function of the pathogenicity (and/or virulence) of the organisms and the reactive ability of the host. The histological expression of the host as well as immunological and biochemical responses depend on non-specific barriers which fail to prevent entry and the control, by different systems and in different tissues, of the inflammatory reaction. Inflammation can be classified into acute and chronic inflammation. Obviously, the objective of the process includes repair and destruction of the infectious agent. Histological expression of inflammation reflects the protective response. Animal models have been used in experimental pathology for kinetic studies to describe and analyse the different steps of the inflammatory process. This review summarizes the sequence of events in acute and chronic inflammation and attempts to classify patterns of the inflammatory process according to the infectious agent.",

Leakage of blood appears immediately or within minutes after injury, peaks 5-10 min later and decreases within 30 min. This leakage can be induced by bradykinin, histamine, leukotriene and serotonin, and is inhibited by cytochalasin B and EDTA. Histamine and bradykinin from mastocytes and platelets are the two major components of this reaction. Prostaglandins are also involved, particularly PG2 which potentializes the action of histamine and bradykinin.",

The initial inflammatory response to the introduction of a foreign antigen consists of recruitment of macrophages and mast cells that release interleukin-l, TNF, TGF-P and histamine. These cytokines, or bacterial products stimulate the production of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ELAM-1, GMP 140 and VCAM on endothelial cells and also of ICAM-and LEU-CAMS on WBCs in vessels. This is followed by the adhesion of WBCs to endothelia and transmigration of polymorphonuclear cells through the endothehum within the infected sites. In an inflammatory immune response, T lymphocytes and macrophages cooperate and the specificity of the reaction is confined to the TCR. Promotion of LFA-1 and ICAM-binding may be induced by specific signals. Integrins are central to the pathophysiology of enteric infections. For example, the inactivation of CD 18 in a rabbit model of experimental shigellosis suppresses the inflammatory response (Perdomo et al., 1994) . In human and experimental malaria, integrins are also implicated in the phenomenon of adherence and sequestration of WBCs.",
