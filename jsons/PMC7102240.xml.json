            "text": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATLL) was first described in Japan by Uchiyama in 1977 with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and bone marrow (BM) infiltration in 16 adults, which was differentiated from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [1]. The association of ATLL and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 virus was discovered because all patients have antibodies against the virus, which corresponded with a high incidence of ATLL patients in areas with a high incidence of HTLV-1 carriers. It was found that HTLV-1 immortalizes human T-cells in vitro, which led to the discovery of monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA in leukemia cells, thus making it the first retrovirus directly associated with human malignancy [2]. The incidence of ATLL is estimated to be 2.5 % among HTLV-1 carriers in endemic areas [3] and, according to SEER data, 0.04 % in the USA, a nonendemic area [4]. ATLL patients constitute 9.6 % of total T-cell lymphomas, 2 % in North America, 1 % in Europe, and 25 % in Asia [5]. In an observational study, men were slightly more likely to be affected, with a sex ratio of male:female = 1.2\u20131.35:1 and mean age of 57.1 years (range, 24\u201392 years) [6, 7]. The virus is transmitted by blood transfusion, sharing of needles, sexual intercourse, and breastfeeding. Infections with HTLV-1 and cases of ATLL are endemic in several regions of the world, including southwestern Japan (Kyushu), the Caribbean basin, and Central Africa. A recent epidemiological study revealed that although incidences in endemic areas are stable with annual 0 % increase [95 % confidence interval (CI), \u22121.6 to 1.7], there is an increase in nonendemic areas in Japan of +4.6 % (CI, 1.1\u20138.2) as well as in the USA, +6.2 % (CI, 1.5\u201311.1), with a stable male predominance of 1.26 [8].",

NF-\u03baB and Akt pathways are two major cellular pro-survival routes activated by Tax, which initiates the malignant transformation, considering that more than 80 % exhibit DNA aneuploidy. The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) is seen in all ATLL cases [3]. The HBZ protein has a role in promoting viral replication and cellular proliferation, maintaining the malignancy when Tax expression has been extinguished [10]. Regarding phenotype, ATLL cells express T-cell-associated antigens (CD2, CD3, CD5) and mostly CD4+ CD8\u2212, CD25, as well as gain-of-function CCR4 mutations [11] and FoxP3, the master protein of the regulatory T cell [3, 6]. Gains of 7p and 7q and loss of 9p21.3 in addition to mutations of RHOA show a significant association with poor prognosis [12].",

Chemotherapy was administered on a cycle of 21\u201328 days for a minimum of two cycles beyond best response and a maximum of six cycles. Prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia and tumor lysis syndrome was provided. Central nervous system prophylaxis was either cytosine arabinoside or intrathecal methotrexate.

The treatment consists of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VCAP), doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone (AMP), and vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VECP). This regimen was tested solely in Japan because ranimustine is a nitrosurea alkylating agent (MCNU) that is only available there. This regimen was initially studied in a phase II trial with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support in the LSG15 protocol. Therapy consisted of seven cycles of VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP. Eighty-one per cent of the 93 eligible patients responded (95 % CI, 0.71\u20130.88), with 33 patients obtaining complete response (CR) (35.5 %) and 42 obtaining partial response (PR) (45.2 %). The median survival time (MST) after registration was 13 months, and the median follow-up duration of the 20 surviving patients was 4.2 years (range, 2.8\u20135.6 years). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was estimated to be 31.3 % (95 % CI, 0.22\u20130.405) [18]. In a phase III clinical trial, VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP was compared to biweekly CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with a total of 118 patients enrolled [19]. Both arms used intrathecal methotrexate for prophylaxis because of the high frequency of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. Median follow-up time for all randomly assigned patients was 10.9 months. The complete response (CR) rate was higher in the VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP arm than in the biweekly CHOP arm (40 % vs. 25 %, respectively; p < 0.02). Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year was 28 % in the VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP arm compared with 16 % in the CHOP arm (p < 0.1; two-sided p < 0.2). OS at 3 years was 24 % in the VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP arm and 13 % in the CHOP arm (p < 0.085; two-sided p < 0.169). This study highlighted that CHOP chemotherapy is not sufficient as treatment for ATLL and that we should consider a more cytotoxic regimen.",

Allo-HSCT was studied for acute and lymphoma types of ATLL in seven institutions in Japan between 1997 and 2002. All evaluable cases entered CR after allo-HSCT, and the median survival time was 9.6 months for all patients. The estimated 3-year overall and relapse-free survival, and disease relapse, were 45.3 %, 33.8 %, and 39.3 %, respectively [23]. Conditioning with myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) is varied, and in one study, ten patients received total body irradiation (10\u201313.2 Gy) along with some combination of cyclophosphamide (CY), melphalan, cytosine-arabinoside (CA), and etoposide (ETO), in addition to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Side effects included nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, as well as hemorrhagic cystitis, CMV antigenemia, zoster, pneumonitis, and septicemia. The median leukemia-free survival after allo-HSCT was 17.5 months (range, 3.7\u201334.4 months) and five patients were disease free at a median of 31.5 months. Two (20 %) patients relapsed at 3.7 and 4.0 months after allo-SCT, and four (40 %) patients died. The causes of death included renal insufficiency after relapse, interstitial pneumonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding probably caused by thrombotic microangiopathy, and grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [24]. Given the high mortality of the myeloablative conditioning regimen in the elderly, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) using peripheral blood of HLA-matched siblings after undergoing a conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine, busulfan, and rabbit antithymocyte globulin for patients aged 50\u201370 years has been found to be effective [25]. A Japanese nationwide retrospective study found that in transplant recipients, median OS and 3-year OS of bone marrow or peripheral blood transplantation recipients (n = 586) was 9.9 months (95 % CI, 7.4\u201313.2 months) and 36 % (32\u201341 %), respectively. Median OS and 3-year OS for recipients of myeloablative conditioning for those younger than 55 years were 9.5 months (6.7\u201318.0 months) and 39 % (33\u201345 %), and RIC for patients 50\u201370 years of age was 10.0 months (7.2\u201314.0 months) and 34 % (29\u201340 %), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated five significant variables contributing to poorer OS, namely, older age, male sex, not in complete remission, poor performance status, and transplantation from unrelated donors. Although no significant difference in OS between MAC and RIC was observed, there was a trend indicating that RIC contributed to better OS in older patients [26].",

Mean survival was 10.2 months in 1991 and 10.6 months in the 2000s, but without allo-HSCT it was 9.7 months compared to 13.9 months with transplant. Four-year overall survival (OS) improved from 5.7 % to 16.2 %; it was 13.7 % without allo-HSCT and 32.3 % with transplant. Although this is a very difficult disease to treat, innovations in management seem to have improved survival [27]. In a retrospective study, early stem cell transplant patients may have a better chance of OS. The patients were grouped in either the early allo-HSCT group within 100 days of diagnosis (n = 72) or the late transplant group at 100 days or more (n = 428), and the median age of patients enrolled was 52 years. The corresponding constituents of disease status were not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.11). The probability of OS in the early transplant group was significantly higher than in the late transplant group (4-year OS, 49.3 % vs. 31.2 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that late allo-HSCT was an unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (HR, 1.46, 95 % CI, 1.01\u20132.11; p = 0.04) [28]. Another retrospective study in Japan examined the impact on GVHD on survival in patients with ATLL. Patients with lymphoma type were found to have worse outcomes. In grade I\u2013II acute GVHD, the hazard ratio (HR) was found to be 1.82 (95 % CI, 1.03\u20133.24) compared to chronic/smoldering with HR of 0.24 (95 % CI, 0.05\u20131.03) and acute with HR of 0.5 (95 % CI, 0.34\u20130.73). In grade III\u2013IV acute GVHD, the HR for lymphoma type was 2.11 (95 % CI, 0.97\u20134.53) compared to chronic/smoldering with HR of 0.75 (95 % CI, 0.14\u20133.98) and acute with HR of 1.42 (95 % CI, 0.9\u20132.23). Chronic GVHD seemed to have protective effects on ATLL-related mortality compared to not having GVHD, but the opposite is true when looking at treatment-related mortality [29].",

Subjects assigned to the mLSG15-plus-mogamulizumab arm received up to eight infusions of mogamulizumab during four cycles of mLSG15. Cytarabine, methotrexate, and prednisolone were intrathecally injected before initiation of VCAP administration in cycles 2 and 4. Of the 29 and 24 patients evaluable for efficacy in the mLSG15-plus-mogamulizumab and the mLSG15 arms, 25 patients (ORR, 86 %; 95 % CI, 0.68\u20130.96) and 18 patients (ORR, 75 %; 95 % CI, 0.53\u20130.9), respectively, had objective responses.

Studies have found no exposure or geographic predisposition but that there could be an association with immunocompromised status, infections, or antibiotic use [43\u201345] as well as with autoimmune thrombocytopenia [46]. Among many microorganisms, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and HHV-6 in particular are detectable in the great majority of tumors, likely caused by the immunocompromised status in AITL patients [47\u201352]. EBV co-infection may lead to B-cell malignancy with primary T-cell malignancy, although EBV involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease is still debated. Cytogenetic abnormalities including trisomy 3 and trisomy 5 with T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement were found in up to 85\u201390 % of cases [53]. RHOA, TET2, IDH2, and DNMT3A mutations have been found to be associated with the disease pathogenesis [54\u201362]. Gene expression analyses of AITL in mouse studies showed that essentially all cases expressed elevated levels of transcripts for IL21, IL21R, and a series of genes associated with follicular helper T-cell (TFH) development and function [63]. Expression of CD3, CD10, CD28, CD30, CXCL13, ICOS, and PD1 has been detected with histopathological staining of AITL cells [43, 54, 64\u201373]. Because of the compatible expression of CD3, CD4, CD10, and CXCL13, AITL is thought to be the overproliferation of germinal center T-helper cells with CXCL13, which is important in B-cell recruitment and activation, likely contributing to B-cell abnormalities also seen in patients [74, 75]. Recently, an analysis of microRNA suggests upregulation of miR-146a, miR-193b, and miR-34a, which may contribute to the oncogenesis of AITL [76].",

The cases of AITL are categorized into pattern I, pattern II, and pattern III according to the presence of hyperplastic follicles, regressed follicles, or absence of identifiable follicles [64]. Pattern I, which constitutes 18.75 % of AITL, was noted to have partial preservation of the lymph node architecture with hyperplastic B-cell follicles with poorly developed mantle zones and poorly defined borders identifiable in the cortex of the lymph node. Pattern II, 32.25 % of AITL, was characterized by loss of normal architecture except for an occasional depleted follicle with concentrically arranged FDCs. In pattern III, 43.75 % of AITL, the normal architecture was completely effaced and no B-cell follicles could be identified; prominent irregular proliferations of FDCs with extensive vascular proliferation were noted. All three groups had a polymorphic infiltrate of lymphocytes and transformed large lymphoid blasts, plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. Diffuse effacement and neovascular infiltration by plasma cells and immunoblasts are seen [53].",

Patients enrolled in the study had a median age of 52 years [80]. Twenty of the 33 patients (61 %) achieved CR, with progression-free response ranging from 3 to 108 months with a median of 26 months, and 9 patients with persistent first CR; 5-year OS was 36.2 %. Adverse events leading to death included immune suppression resulting in severe infection as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). More recently, CHOP-21 and CHOEP-21 were cycled every 3 weeks, and CHOP-14 and CHOEP-14 were cycled every 2 weeks, in patients with T-cell lymphoma, supported by recombinant human G-CSF (filgrastim) from days 4 to 13. Few patients enrolled had AITL, and the complete remission rates for the whole study were 60.1 % (CHOP-21), 70.0 % (CHOEP-21), 76.1 % (CHOP-14), and 71.6 % (CHOEP-14). Five-year event-free and OS rates were 32.5 % and 40.6 %, respectively, for CHOP-21 and 43.8 % and 53.3 %, respectively, for CHOP-14. In a multivariate analysis, the relative risk reduction was 0.66 (p = 0.003) for event-free and 0.58 (p < 0.001) for OS after CHOP-14 compared with CHOP-21. Because of its favorable efficacy and toxicity profile, CHOP-14 was recommended for patients ages 60 or older with aggressive T-cell lymphoma [81, 82]. A follow-up study comparing CHOEP 14 and 21 for aggressive T-cell lymphoma patients, although only 1 of 139 AITL patients received CHOEP-14, found that with CHOEP-21, 63 of 78 (80.8 %) patients achieved CR and 7.7 % PR whereas 9.0 % had progressive disease under treatment. Of the patients who received CHOEP-14, 27 of 41 (65.8 %) achieved CR and 12.2 % PR, with 17.1 % having progression under therapy. Four-year event-free survival (EFS) was 47.9 % after CHOEP-14 and 66.2 % after CHOEP-21, and 4-year OS was 62.1 % after CHOEP-14 and 73.4 % after CHOEP-21, respectively, suggesting a longer cycle may have better outcomes in patients younger than 60 [82, 83]. Studies conducted by the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (DSHNHL) found that for patients with AITL (27 % of patients studied) receiving six to eight courses of CHOP or CHOEP to have a 3-year EFS of 50.0 % (95 % CI, 31.6\u201368.4 %) with OS of 67.5 % (95 % CI, 50.1\u201384.9 %) [84]. Treatment for 28 days was found to have a CR rate of 70 %; however, many patients relapsed, with 5-year OS of 36 % [42]. Accordingly, upfront hematological stem cell transplant in patients with AITL after achieving CR should be considered to prevent relapse. COEP-B with or without radiotherapy was studied in 52 patients with median age of 47 years (range, 17\u201378 years). Five (10 %) of patients had AITL [85]; 2 (40 %) had a complete response and 2 (40 %) had a partial response. Toxicities included nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as deadly adverse events of pancreatitis and intracranial hemorrhage.",

Other cutaneous forms of T-cell lymphoma are discussed later. ALCL is likely on the same spectrum of disease along with lymphomatoid papulosis and cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma [116]. As with other T-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma can have CNS involvement [117, 118]. Of 1403 cases of NHL obtained worldwide in the International Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma Classification Project, only 7 % represented a subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and 2.4 % were anaplastic large T/null-cell lymphoma (ALCL).

A recent review of BI-ALCL found that all patients were women, and the median age was 54 years (range, 28\u201387 years), with 58.6 % of those analyzed undergoing breast implants for cosmetic reasons and 41.4 % for breast cancer reconstruction. The median interval from implantation to diagnosis of BI-ALCL was 8 years (range, 2\u201325 years), with no difference between silicone and saline implant types [121].",

Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is a subtype of nodal and extranodal lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by peculiar histopathological features and the positivity of lymphoid proliferating cells for Ki-1/Ber-H2 monoclonal antibody [111\u2013113]. Biopsies of the lymph node usually show subtotal or sinusoidal involvement, and parenchymal fibrosis is common [114]. The large neoplastic cells are admixed with many reactive small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and/or neutrophils. Two cytological types of ALCL have been described: type I (pale cell) consisted of large polygonal cells with distinct pink-staining cell membrane and pale cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei showing marked chromatin clearing; and type II (basophilic cell) consisted of round or oval cells with basophilic cytoplasm and/or paranuclear pale, pleomorphic nuclei often reniform or lobulated and with frequent multinucleated wreath-like and Reed\u2013Sternberg-like cells [114]. Lymphocytes and granulocytes are significantly deficient in ALCL [124].",

            "text": "Expression of CD15 (more commonly in Hodgkins but can be seen in ALCL) [125], CD2, CD3, CD4, CD25, CD30 (Ki-1, BerH2), CD45, CD68, CD71, CD74, HLA-DR, EMA, vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, BNH9, and restin are associated with ALCL [109, 126\u2013135]. There are also associated beta- and gamma-TCR gene rearrangements in ALCL [136, 137]. Most of the patients will have stage III/IV disease at diagnosis with cytogenetic abnormalities in chromosome 2,5,7 [138]. Repeat case reports of t(2;5)(p23;q35) and t(3;5)(q12;q35) [139\u2013141] lead to the isolation of fusion mRNA NPM-ALK (also known as p80NPM-ALK), or other variant chimera X-ALK [142, 143]. Normal NPM protein is a non-ribosomal nucleolar phospho-protein involved with pre-ribosomal particles in both small and large ribosomal subunits. The NPM gene contributes an active promoter to drive expression of tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) on 2p23, which is normally silent in lymphoid cells. The isolation of the chimeric protein led to the development of ALK1 or p80 antibody [144, 145] and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detection [146] with expression in 55\u201363 % of systemic ALCLs [145, 147\u2013149]. ALK+ ALCL is thought to derive from an activated mature cytotoxic T cell [150]. One recurrent translocation t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) is associated with the DUSP22 and IRF4 loci. The DUSP22 gene encodes a phosphatase, and its disruption is associated with upregulation of miR-29a and miR-29b on 7q32.3 [151]. ALK\u2212 ALCL has CD30 expression without ALK protein expression, likely a heterogeneous group of diseases classified by specific translocations [149, 151].",

            "text": "Cutaneous ALCL, histologically, have large and sometimes multinucleated cells with rounded or, more often, irregular nuclei containing nucleoli ranging from a large single nucleolus to small multiple nucleoli; the cytoplasm is usually abundant. Translocations involving the interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) gene (also known as MUM1) have been described in a subset of cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [152\u2013154]. Because of their high growth fraction with lymph node extension, they are considered high grade and aggressive [155], and no precursor cell has been associated with the cutaneous subtype [143]. Breast implant-associated ALCL is defined as a T-cell lymphoma associated with a breast implant, with large, pleomorphic cells staining CD3\u2212, CD4+, CD5\u2212, CD30+, CD43+, and ALK\u2212. The odds ratio is 18.2 (95 % CI, 2.1\u2013156.8) for ALCL associated with breast implants [156]. In a study reviewing BI-ALCL, about 60 % of patients presented with an effusion around the implant, 20 % with a breast mass and effusion, 17 % with breast mass, and 3 % with neither [121]. Most had lymphoma confined to the capsule or just beyond the capsule but 15 % had lymph node spread [121, 157]. Pathogenesis is likely caused by inflammation, leading to polyclonal and eventually monoclonal lymphocytic activation against silicone, progressing to lymphoma [158]. Immune compromise may be a contributing factor to the development of ALCL, seen in cases after renal transplant, immunosuppressive therapy for Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [137, 159\u2013161]. EBV is not a likely causal factor given studies have shown positive PCR but negative Southern blots [162, 163].",

Patients mostly were treated with CHOP (91 % of the ALCL and 78 % of the CUT-ALCL). The CUT-ALCL had the best prognosis, with CR 89 % and 5-year OS 78 %. On CHOP, the ALK+ group 5-year OS was 58 %, better than ALK\u2212 of which the OS was 34 %, although relapse was common for both groups. Three received autologous bone marrow transplant at relapse although only one remained in remission after 2 years [42]. CHOP and CHOEP were studied in patients with aggressive lymphomas; ALCL consisted of 3.5 % of the patients between 61 and 75 years old. Of all the patients, those with ALCL consitituted 3.9 % of those who received CHOP-21, 3.4 % CHOP-14, 3.6 % CHOEP-21, and 3 % CHOEP-14. Complete remission rates for all patients were 60.1 % (CHOP-21), 70.0 % (CHOEP-21), 76.1 % (CHOP-14), and 71.6 % (CHOEP-14). Five-year event-free and overall survival rates were 32.5 % and 40.6 %, respectively, for CHOP-21 and 43.8 % and 53.3 %, respectively, for CHOP-14. In a multivariate analysis, the relative risk reduction was 0.66 (p = 0.003) for event-free survival and 0.58 (p < 0.001) for overall survival after CHOP-14 compared with CHOP-21. Because of its favorable efficacy and toxicity profile, CHOP-14 was recommended for patients ages 60 or older with aggressive lymphoma [81, 82]. A follow-up study comparing 18- to 60-year-old patients on CHOEP-14 of CHOEP-21, with 9.4 % ALCL of 139 patients (7.9 % of all patients on CHOP-21, 9.9 % CHOP-14, 10.8 % CHOEP-21, 9.1 % CHOEP-14), found that with high CHOEP-21, 63 of 78 (80.8 %) patients achieved CR and 7.7 % PR while 9.0 % had progressive disease under treatment. After high-CHOEP-14, 27 of 41 (65.8 %) achieved CR and 12.2 % PR; 17.1 % had progression under therapy. Four-year EFS was 47.9 % after high-CHOEP-14 and 66.2 % after high-CHOEP-21, and 4-year OS was 62.1 % after high-CHOEP-14 and 73.4 % after high-CHOEP-21, respectively, suggesting a longer cycle may have better outcomes in patients younger than 60 years [82, 83].",

Of 15 patients, 13 relapsed after transplant; 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Median PFS for 15 patients was 12 weeks. Two-thirds of the patients died, with 9 of 10 of those patients dying of recurrent disease. Median survival was 72 weeks, and there was no transplant-related mortality [169]. In a retrospective analysis of 77 patients with T-cell lymphoma treated with myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic SCT after at least one previous treatment line (ALCL 27 of 77, 35 %), the 5-year OS and EFS rates were 57 % (95 % CI, 45\u201368 %) and 53 % (95 % CI, 41\u201364 %), respectively.

For the first time, in 2011 two patients with chemotherapy-resistant ALK+ ALCL were treated with crizotinib. Both patients showed response, although the results were reported after only 6 months [172]. A follow-up study with 11 patients enrolled 7 men and 4 women (median age, 28 years; range, 19\u201355 years). Nine patients (82 %) had ALCL.

Adverse events included ocular flashes, peripheral edema, skin rash, erectile dysfunction, and hematological abnormalities [173]. However, ALK tyrosine kinase inhibition eventually leads to resistance, secondary to ALK gene mutation and amplification, bypassing downstream signaling via EGFR, KIT, SRC, or IGF-1R [174, 175]. In response, more drugs are being developed to overcome resistance [165, 176]. Second-generation ALK TKIs are in clinical trials, including certinib, alectinib, and brigatinib for ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer, but will likely be used for all ALK+ malignancies in the future [177].",

The leukemic cells possessed medium to large granules in the cytoplasm, antigens against CD2 and CD56 (NKH-1, N901) monoclonal antibodies on their cell surface, and also showed a high natural killer (NK) activity [180]. CD56 (NKH-1) expression is a rare phenomenon in malignant lymphomas, previously described as confined to the nasal or nasopharyngeal region, particularly in middle-aged men (mean age, 40 years), that were found to have a highly aggressive course [181]. NK lymphomas are now described as nodal or extranodal, including a nasal type, formerly called lethal midline granuloma [182]. In 1996 it was proposed that CD5\u2212 CD56+ TCR silent PTCL should be categorized as a malignancy of NK cells [183]. Patients with nasopharyngeal lymphoma presented with skin, subcutis, GI tract, and testicular or non-nasal involvement [181, 183\u2013186]. Extranodal NK, excluding the nasal type, is usually diagnosed at a later stage and seems to have a worse prognosis than the nasal type, which is more localized [184, 186]. NK/T-cell lymphoma constitutes 10.4\u201311.8 % of T-cell lymphomas, with 5.1 % in North America, 4.3 % in Europe, and 22.4 % in Asia, with male predominance 2:1 and median age of 49 years at diagnosis [5, 186]. Of NK/T lymphomas, 68 % are nasal, 26 % extra-nasal, and 6 % are unclassifiable [186].",

The Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) is associated with the nasal type, although usually infecting B cells, because EBV is present in patients with tumor cells containing clonal viral genomes in addition to detectable viral transcripts and protein. EBV DNA levels are elevated in most cases of extranodal nasal-type NK/T lymphoma, and the quantity at diagnosis and the pattern of detection during and after treatment have been shown to be predictive of outcome [187\u2013191]. Localized nasal lymphoma have been shown to have diffuse infiltration by medium-sized to large abnormal lymphoid cells with irregular and pleomorphic nuclei in addition to angiocentricity and coagulative necrosis [184]. NK cells can be characterized by their immunophenotype. NK lymphoma cells express at least one of the T-cell antigens CD2+, cytoplasmic CD3+, CD5\u2212, and CD56+, but are negative for TCR antibodies [183, 192]. TP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (ABCC4) levels have been found to be upregulated in human NK/T-cell lymphoma as compared with normal NK cells [193]. Molecular studies have shown deletion of 6q21, which contains tumor-suppressor genes such as FOXO3, PRDM1, and HACE1, causing dysregulation of NK cells and oncological pathway activation. JAK3 gene mutations seen in NK/T lymphoma also result in oncogenesis from JAK/STAT activation.",

Another study that enrolled 30 patients with median age of 48.5 years (range, 23\u201373 years), with nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma were treated with CCRT (radiation and cisplatin) followed by three cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and dexamethasone (VIPD). After CCRT, 22 (73 %) achieved CR and 8 (27 %) PR. After VIPD chemotherapy, 19 patients retained CR, and 5 patients with PR to CCRT achieved CR. Twenty-four (80 %) patients achieved CR after the completion of VIPD (95 % CI, 65.7\u201394.3), and 4 (13 %) of the 30 patients experienced disease progression. Three-year OS and PFS rates were 86.28 % and 85.19 %, respectively. Adverse events included hematological suppression, nausea, stomatitis, and neuropathy [199].",

After two cycles of chemotherapy, radiation was started, and then chemotherapy was given for two to four cycles at 1 week after the completion of radiation. At the end of treatment, the ORR was 88.5 %, including 21 patients with CR (80.8 %; 95 % CI, 65.6\u201395.9 %), 2 with PR (7.7 %), and 3 with progression (11.5 %).

            "text": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a classification that encompass mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome, and related lymphoproliferative disorders that originate in the skin with systemic involvement [218]. Mycosis fungoides and Sezary are both T-cell malignancies with similar cytological and histological features; progression from small plaques to cutaneous tumors may lead to eventually involvement of lymph nodes and viscera. Based on SEER date, incidence of CTCL is 7.7/1,000,000 person-years [219]. CTCL is associated with a median age at diagnosis in the mid-fifties, male predominance (male-to-female ratio, 1.7:1), and a higher incidence in African Americans [220, 221]. Overall survival of CTCL was 63 months, with 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates of 88 %, 77 %, and 52 %, respectively [220]. CTLC consists of a diverse group of diseases. Mycosis fungoides, first described by Jean Louis Alibert in 1806, named because of the cutaneous mushroom-like appearance, was found to have involvement of lymph nodes, blood, and viscera [222]. Patients with mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common CTCL, classically present with patches, plaques, tumors, and ulcers [218]. Pagetoid reticulosis, first described in 1939 by Woringer and Kolopp, is a variant of MF and presents as localized, hypertrophic, or verrucous lesions on extremities [223]. Folliculotrophic MF is another type that presents with hair loss, known as alopecia mucinosa [223]. Sezary syndrome, first described in 1938, is characterized by exfoliative erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and circulating diagnostic cerebriform cells, known as Sezary cells [222]. It is a rare leukemic variant with high mortality and median overall survival of 5.1 years [224]. Patients may present with pruritis as well as skin lesions on the face that can be hyperpigmented, producing lion-like faces with ectropion formation leading to ocular inflammation [218, 225]. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder with a self-regressing clinical course that is associated with increased risk of lymphoma [226].",

            "text": "CTCL is an indolent, epidermotrophic CD2\u2212 CD3+ CD4+ CD5\u2212 CD7\u2212 CD8\u2212 CD45 Ro+, CCR4+ T-cell lymphoma characterized by eczematous or psoriasiform skin lesions as seen in mycosis fungoides (MF) or by diffuse erythroderma and circulating atypical lymphocytes as seen in Sezary syndrome (SS) [221, 223]. MF and SS were both determined to be derived from T-cells; more specifically, MF from the tissue-resident memory cells localized in the skin compared to SS from the central memory cells or regulatory T-cells, which can access peripheral blood and explains the leukemic nature of SS [225, 227\u2013231]. MF histologically presents with a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic convoluted nuclei and scant cytoplasm within the upper dermis, with the epidermis containing similar cells in aggregates known as Pautrier microabscesses [223]. Pagetoid reticulosis histologically shows cytologically atypical mononuclear cells that exhibit epidermotropism with a clonal rearrangement of the beta T-cell receptor gene compared to folliculotrophic MF, which presents with alopecia because of the tumor infiltration of hair follicles with deposition of mucin [223]. Sezary described the pathognomonic feature of SS as \u201ccellules monstrueuses,\u201d monstrous cells greater in size than a polymorphonuclear leukocyte, with a voluminous, irregularly shaped nucleus occupying 80 % of the cell and around which the cytoplasm forms a thin crown. There is evidence that CTCL is caused by chronic antigen stimulation with the protumorgenic role of mast cells and macrophages in CTCL from an infectious etiology or medication [221, 224, 225, 229, 231, 232]. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), the most frequently found leukocyte population within the tumor microenvironment, produce distinct biochemical and cytokine profiles in many types of tumors, with low IL12, high IL10, and VEGF driving angiogenesis [233]. Staphylococcus aureus has been hypothesized to be related to CTCL pathogenesis, with an association between it and CTCL, as disease improvement is noted with bacterial eradication and changes in T-cell receptor Vb consistent with superantigen stimulation [234, 235]. Although Merkel cell polyomavirus and HTLV-1 have been found not to be the causal oncogenic virus in CTCL, there is evidence for oncogenic infectious agents because infectious disease pathways are upregulated [236\u2013238]. Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with MF, supported by recession of disease with discontinuation of the drug and recurrence with re-initiation; the mechanism is possibly from the chlorine atom dissociated by UVB to create free radicals [239]. STAT3 was found to be activated, leading to abnormal growth regulation in tumor cells and resistance against apoptosis [240, 241]. FAS deficiency as well as overexpression of TOX, PLS3, KIR3DL2, ITGB1, PDCD6, TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A, CDKN1B, MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11, and PRKG1 are also found to be molecular mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to apoptosis and oncogenesis in CTCL [224, 242\u2013246].",

Relapse was seen in 33 patients with a median disease-free interval of 39 months (range, 5\u2013238 months). Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 56 % and 30 % for stage IA and 74 % and 50 % for stage IB/IIA, respectively. Adverse effects included photo damage and secondary skin cancers [261]. A review found that 58\u2013100 % of MF patients treated with PUVA achieved CR with varying degrees of relapse. In some patients with early MF, a CR of up to 6 years may be sustained without maintenance therapy. During the follow-up period in one study, 50 % maintained a CR and 50 % experienced relapse. Adverse effects include erythema, fatigue, headache, photosensitivity, nail changes, photoaging, and skin cancer [260]. In a retrospective comparison study of 114 patients with early-stage (IA\u2013IIA) MF, 95 patients (mean age, 59 years; range, 30\u201380 years), were treated with PUVA and 19 patients of mean age 68 years (range, 31\u201387 years) were treated with UVB.

OS was 77 months in MF and 48 months in SS with conventional dose regimens, compared to 14 months in MF and 16 months in SS with lower dose, demonstrating dose response. Median PFS for a conventional dose was 15 months in MF and 19 months in SS, compared to low dose, which was 8 months in MF and 3 months in SS [266]. Also confirming that a conventional dose >30 Gy is more efficacious, 102 patients of median age 59 years (range, 21\u201390 years) with MF were treated with radiation doses of 5 to <10 Gy (very low), 10 to <20 Gy (low), and 20 to <30 Gy (medium). With T2\u2013T4 disease, CR were 16 % in the very low dose, 35 % in the low dose, and 34 % in the medium dose, compared to 62 % at the conventional >30 Gy dose. Clinical response was seen in 96 % of patients, and response rates were higher among those with earlier-stage disease or those receiving higher doses of radiation [267]. These studies reported adverse effects as temporary alopecia, dermatitis, edema, pain, nail changes, and fatigue.",

Bexarotene, the oral or topical RXR-selective rexinoid, promotes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In one study, 58 patients of median age 64 years (range, 24\u201386 years) with stage IA\u2013IIA refractory CTCL were treated with oral bexarotene. The overall response was 48.2 %, although this improved to 58 % with doses greater than 300 mg/m2. Clinical complete responses occurred in 2 (7 %) of the 28 patients with 300 mg/m2 and in 4 (27 %) of the 15 patients with >300 mg/m2. Adverse events included headache, hypothyroidism, hematological suppression, infection, and hypertriglyceridemia [268]. In another study, 94 patients of median age 64 years (range, 27\u201389 years) with IIB\u2013IV CTLC were treated with bexarotene at 300 mg/m2/day. The overall response rate was 45 % (25 of 56) of patients starting at 300 mg/m2/day and in 55 % (21 of 38) of patients at higher doses. CR occurred in 2 % (1/56) of the patients at 300 mg/m2/day and in 13 % (5/38 patients) at the higher doses. Adverse events were similar to the previous [269]. It was noted that patients taking two lipid-lowering medications had a higher response rate of 90 % during monotherapy, suggesting that the treatment of adverse effects of bexarotene can prolong response [270]. In a combination trial with interferon, 22 patients with median age 57 years (range, 22\u201379 years) with stage refractory IB\u2013IV CTCL were treated with oral bexarotene and subcutaneous interferon-alpha. The overall response rate was 39 % (95 % CI, 17\u201364 %), including 1 patient with a CR, 6 patients with PR, 3 patients with stable disease, and 8 patients with progressive disease. The addition of interferon-alpha did not increase the response rate that would have been expected with bexarotene alone, and accordingly such combination is not recommended [271].",

Interferon-alpha inhibits IL-4 production in both normal T cells and Sezary cells. In one study, 22 patients with stage I\u2013IV CTCL who were treated with interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) showed an ORR of 64 % with 3 CR, 10 PR, and 1 minor response. An objective response was seen in 73 % of the patients with stage IA\u2013IIA CTCL compared to 60 % of those with stage IIB\u2013IVA disease. Adverse events included malaise, fatigue, depression, anorexia, and weight loss [272]. Interferon-alpha was also evaluated in another study with 51 patients enrolled (median age, 56.8 years; range, 15\u201374 years), and results showed CR in 21 (41 %) patients and PR in 13 (25 %). The study also showed that 17 patients had stable or progressive disease (34 %); 12 (57 %) of the 21 patients in CR had relapse within a mean period of 7.5 months. Adverse effects were similar as noted previously [273]. IFN\u03b1 is also used in combination with other external, cytotoxic, or immunomodulating agents with overall response rates of 42\u201386 % [274]. Given Fas deficiency in CTCL, interferon-alpha and methotrexate upregulate Fas via different mechanisms. Interferon-alpha acts through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway, enhancing Fas protein expression and sensitivity to Fas pathway apoptosis [275]. A study of refractory MF and SS treated with a combination of INF\u03b1 and methotrexate enrolled 158 patients with a median age of 63.4 years (range, 18\u201383 years) found that by 12 months, 112 (74 %) achieved CR but 52 (47 %) of those cases relapsed. Forty patients died of tumor progression and 8 of treatment toxicity; 10-year overall survival was 69 %. Adverse events included flu-like syndrome, granulocytopenia, and transaminitis [276].",

ECP leads to monocyte activation, dendritic cell differentiation, and initiation of host immune response [260]. In the initial study, 27 of 37 patients responded to treatment without bone marrow suppression, GI complaints, or alopecia [285]. Twenty patients with a mean age of 61.2 years (range, 29\u201385 years) at diagnosis of CTCL were studied with an overall response of 55 %, with 7 (35 %) CR, 4 (20 %) PR, and 8 (40 %) with progression of disease and 1 (5 %) with stabilization of disease. Adverse events included nausea, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hematomas without any incidence of infection [286]. A review of 438 patients with MF/SS who underwent ECP found that 244 of 438 (55.7 %) had a significant response. Adverse reactions are rare and are most likely related to discomfort or hematomas at the venipuncture site, but sepsis, disseminated fungal infections, herpes infection, thrombophlebitis, secondary skin cancer, and machine-induced sepsis have been noted [287]. ECP had been studied also in combination with TSEBT in a study that enrolled 44 patients of median age 68 years (range, 29\u201382 years) with erythrodermic MF to be treated with TSEBT (32\u201340 Gy) and ECP. Thirty-two (73 %) patients achieved CR with a 3-year DFS of 63 %. The 2-year PFS, cause-specific survival, and OS for the TSEBT group were 36 %, 69 %, and 63 %, respectively, compared with 66 %, 100 %, and 88 %, respectively, for the TSEBT in combination with ECP group. Thirteen patients were noted to die of MF-related causes and 8 to die of other causes [288]. ECP was also studied with systemic treatment combinations, and in one study 73 patients with SS underwent treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis and systemic immunostimulatory agents, including IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, TSEBT, PUVA, UVB, chemotherapy, prednisone, GM-CSF, and retinoids.

The overall response was 70 %, seen in 21 of the 30 efficacy-evaluable patients (90 % CI, 53\u201383 %). One patient achieved CR and 20 patients achieved PR. PFS and event-free survival at 125 weeks were about 50 % and 20 %, respectively. Adverse events included peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, and neutropenia [309]. In a phase II study, 48 patients with median age of 59.5 years (range, 31\u201377 years) with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders or MF were treated with brentuximab vedotin. The overall response was seen in 35 of 48 (73 %) patients with CR in 17 (35 %); specifically, the overall response was seen in 50 % of MF/SS compared to the overall response of 100 % in CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders, although their responses were shorter in duration compared to MF. Median duration of response was 26 weeks, OS was 14.7 years (95 % CI, 10.2 years\u2013not reached), and PFS was 1.1 years (95 % CI, 0.9\u20131.4 years).

This gene, as expressed in Escherichia coli, results in the production of a single polypeptide chain that inhibits protein synthesis in cells that express the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), resulting in cell death. Seventy-one patients with median age 61 years (range, 26\u201390 years) with refractory or recurrent stage Ib\u2013IV CTCL underwent treatment with denileukin diftitox. The overall response was 30 %, with 7 patients (10 %) achieving CR; 50 of the 71 patients were non-responders, and adverse events included bone marrow suppression, sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, AKI, acute hypersensitivity events, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, GI complaints, vascular leak syndrome, and DVT [311]. Another study enrolled 144 patients with median age 59 years (range, 23\u201380 years) with pretreated stage I\u2013III CTCL who underwent treatment with varying doses of denileukin diftiox. The ORR for the DD 18 \u03bcg/kg/day group was 49.1 %, with 5 of 55 (9.1 %) CR and 22 of 55 (40.0 %) PR compared with 15.9 % for the placebo group, with 1 of 44 (2.3 %) CR and 6 of 44 (13.6 %) PR (p = 0.0015). For the DD 9 \u03bcg/kg/day group, the ORR was 37.8 % with 5 of 45 (11.1 %) CR and 12 of 45 (26.7 %) PR (p = 0.0297), which suggested a dose response. Progression of disease was recorded in 52.3 % of the placebo patients but in only 21 % of all DD-treated patients. Estimated median PFS time was at least 971 days for the DD 18 \u03bcg/kg/day group, 794 days for the DD 9 \u03bcg/kg/day group, and 124 days for the placebo patients.

In one study, 41 patients with median age of 66 years (range, 35\u201385 years) with refractory or relapsed stage IB\u2013IVB MF/SS were treated with mogamulizumab. The overall response evaluated in 38 patients was 36.8 %, with a higher rate in the SS (47.1 %) group compared to the MF (28.6 %) group. Three patients had CR and 11 patients had PR. Median PFS was 11.4 months, and the median duration of response was 10.4 months. Adverse effects included nausea, chills, infusion reaction, headache, pyrexia, and fatigue [314, 315]. A concurrent translational study found that 14 of 19 patients (73.7 %) had a reduction in CCR4 cells in the blood compared to 5 of 24 (20.8 %) in the skin. The difference between the responses in blood and in the skin may be attributed to the intravenous administration as well as higher numbers of CCR4 cells in blood compared to skin. A longer treatment time may be required to eliminate CCR4+ cells from skin lesions [316]. Currently, a randomized phase III clinical trial studying patients with stage IB\u2013IV MF/SS comparing mogamulizumab and vorinostat in relapsed/refractory CTCL is ongoing in the US (NCT01728805).",

            "text": "T-cell lymphomas are a rare and heterogeneous group of diseases with much still unknown. Treatment outcomes are poor, with high rates of relapse even when patients respond to upfront therapy. Even by understanding the etiology behind some of the T-cell lymphomas, treatment of the initial trigger of the tumorigenesis does not improve outcomes, as one would expect, as in ATLL and treatment of HTLV-1. Even as therapies are targeted toward specific gene mutations and expressions of subtypes of malignancy, there are high rates of division and mutation, resulting in relapse or refractory disease. Ongoing research about the biochemical, transcriptional, histopathological, and clinical progression of the disease is crucial to arm us with better treatment options so our patients can have better choices leading to improved overall survival. Clinical trials in T-cell lymphomas are often considered the first-line therapy because existing chemotherapy regimens are not as effective or as well tolerated by patients as we aspire, highlighting the importance of basic and clinical research in aiding us to defeat these types of lymphomas while minimizing adverse side effects of toxic regimens for our patients. With better understanding of the complex mechanisms involved, we look for a future when we can aim to achieve our utmost goal by curing patients with T-cell lymphomas.",
