Data mining, a process of uncovering silent characteristics of big data is one of such techniques which have nowadays become more popular for treating massive volume of infectious disease data set. In the current study, we apply cluster analysis, one of the data mining techniques to classify real groups of infectious disease \"novel corona virus disease (COVID-19)\" data set of different states and union territories (UTs) in India according to their high similarity to each other. The results obtained permit us to have a sense of clusters of affected Indian states and UTs. The main objective of clustering in this study is to optimize monitoring techniques in affected states and UTs in India which will be very valuable to the government, doctors, the police and others involved in understanding seriousness of the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to improve government policies, decisions, medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks etc.), treatment etc. to reduce number of infected and deceased persons.",

Till now (14 April 2020), there is no specific treatment or vaccine or drug for the disease caused by the COVID-19. The outbreak of infections due to COVID-19 is pushing many countries and regions around the World to take harsh policies, improve medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks, sanitizations etc.) for protection of people. It has resulted more than 1 lakhs deaths of people of different age groups. However, it has been proven that on the basis of the common signs or symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, patients are being treated (the drug named Hydroxychloroquine is useful) based on the patients' health/clinical conditions. Moreover, a highly supportive care for infected persons is highly effective. WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency and encouraged to continue strengthening and improving their preparedness for health emergencies against COVID-19.",

Ward [15] suggested agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis in which a squared Euclidean distance is used for depending similarities in the data set. There is no prior assumption required for this technique and the clustering is done on the basis of similarities within the data set. The ward method is the simplest and the most commonly used method that uses the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate distances between clusters [16] . It has been found an efficient method of data analysis by several authors in case of a large number of data set. In this study, the R software and its packages were used to carry out the cluster analysis. Elbow method using R software was used for getting optimum number of clusters (Fig. 2) . The results obtained from the elbow method suggested six optimum numbers of clusters. The dendrograms of cluster analysis calculated by using all the parameters mentioned above in COVID-19 data set is given in the Fig. 3 for the visual representation and also by a phylogenic tree in Fig. 4 . Cluster I corresponded to the areas Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and West Bengal. Cluster II corresponded to the areas Andaman and Nicobar Island, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Puducherry, Uttarakhand, Assam, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, and Nagaland.
