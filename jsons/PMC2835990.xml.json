            "text": "Vaccines against acute viruses principally work by inducing neutralizing antibodies. Understanding the molecular basis for virus neutralization by antibodies is important, but there has been remarkably little progress in the past in understanding the action of individual human antibodies because of the difficulty in generating human monoclonal antibodies with functional activity against viruses. Recent technical breakthroughs, however, have facilitated the isolation of new human monoclonal antibodies against viruses such as influenza. Careful studies of the molecular basis for specificity or cross-reactivity, and examination of the molecular mechanism of virus inhibition, shed new light on the important interface of viral antigens and the human immune system. As we learn more about the intricate surface interactions between these protein molecules, we gain insight into how we might rationally design (or re-design) viral antigens as vaccines that induce enhanced antibody responses with broader reactivity. The goal of understanding how to induce broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies is particularly relevant for influenza studies because of yearly antigenic drift of field strains, but also is of interest to those designing vaccines to prevent chronic viral infections like HIV and hepatitis C.",

The use of these specific reagents also has made possible improved clinical diagnostics in the medical arena, and a large number of antibodies have found their way to clinical use as therapeutic agents, typically for therapy of cancer or autoimmunity. There is one antibody, palivizumab, which is licensed for prevention of a viral disease, RSV infection. Nevertheless, the potential of mAbs for therapy remains largely unfulfilled. The principal reason for the lack of a large number of mAb therapeutics is simply the difficulty in generating human mAbs of high affinity.",

Examples from clinical medicine include hepatitis A virus (HAV), measles virus, poliovirus, and varicella zoster virus. The number of polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) products licensed for use in the U.S. is striking. Polyclonal Ig preparations with high titers to specific agents are used for a number of viruses including varicella zoster virus Ig, hepatitis B virus Ig, RSV Ig, rabies virus Ig, vaccinia virus Ig, and cytomegalovirus Ig. Difficulties with our ability to sustain these products include the need to find immune donors, the risk of adventitious agents in human-derived blood products, and significant lot-to-lot variability in donor pools. Human mAbs are desirable as replacements for these therapies, or as means for therapy of other conditions whether for infectious diseases or for noninfectious health problems such as autoimmunity or cancer.",

The first mAbs were murine mAbs developed from the fusion of murine splenocytes and non-secreting myelomas. Mice offer many advantages for the generation of mAbs, most notably the opportunity to hyper-immunize subjects and the ability to collect lymphoid tissues including spleen. Murine mAbs have been used in the past in patients, with moderate success. For example, in the early 1980s trials began for treating patients experiencing transplant rejection with the anti-thymocyte (anti-CD3) murine mAb OKT3. Although abrogation of rejection could be achieved in some cases, the patients were treated in the intensive care unit because a significant proportion of patients suffered systemic side effects including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Such severe reactions were due to human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) reaction [2]. Besides anaphylaxis, HAMA also can cause a more subtle effect, the accelerated clearance of the therapeutic antibody with each infusion. Approximately 25% of the U.S. population has anti-mouse antibodies, and following infusion of mouse antibodies virtually all subjects exhibit a HAMA response.",

            "text": "Therefore, efforts were made to reduce the immunogenicity of murine mAbs by replacing murine sequences outside the antigen-combining site with human antibody sequences. Antibody gene cloning techniques made this possible by recombinant means. Initially, human antibody Fc regions were cloned onto mouse Fab regions, yielding so-called \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d. These antibodies could still induce HAMA however, suggesting that a significant proportion of HAMA response is directed to the constant region 1 (CH1 and CL) domains of the antibodies. Subsequent heroic efforts have centered on \u201cantibody humanization\u201d, a process also known as \u201cCDR-grafting.\u201d In this method the variable loops of the mouse mAb antibody combining site (the complementarity determining region [CDR] loops) are cloned onto a human Fab framework that is predicted by three-dimensional modeling to have a similar overall conformation to the mouse Fab. Six CDRs (CDR 1\u20133 of the heavy chain, and CDRs 1\u20133 of the light chain) must be cloned correctly, and often the affinity and functional activity of the humanized antibody are significantly reduced or lost compared with the parental murine mAb. Further modeling can suggest particular framework residues to revert back to mouse sequences in order to restore some of the original conformation [3], [4]. Sometimes the variable domain amino acids are also found to be immunogenic, and further humanization by \u201cvariable domain resurfacing\u201d requires that surface residues not normally found in a human variable fragment (Fv) be mutated to the expected human amino acid, thereby eliminating potentially immunogenic sites [5]. These engineering processes are laborious and time consuming, without guarantee of success.",

Therefore rapid screening procedures of phage-Fabs or expressed antibody fragments often miss the antibodies of interest.

Engraftment rates can be low however, and SCID mice do not provide an environment in which somatic mutation of Ig variable genes takes place efficiently. This approach also was combined with phage display antibody repertoire cloning to yield human Fabs [8]. A similar approach is the Trimera system (human/mouse radiation chimera). In this model, functional human lymphocytes are engrafted in normal strains of mice that are rendered immuno-incompetent by lethal total body irradiation followed by radioprotection with severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse bone marrow [9].

The electric field intensity delivered depends on the cell size. Extent of permeabilization (which correlates experimentally with the flow rate across the membrane) is controlled by both pulse number and duration [18]. Increasing electric field intensity above the critical threshold needed for permeabilization results in an increase in the area of the membrane that is involved. Permeabilization is transient and disappears with time after delivery of the electric field pulses. The rate of resealing of the pore in the membrane may be influenced by both pulse duration and number, but is independent of the electric field intensity that creates the permeabilization [18].",

If electricity is used, merely applying a uniform electric field will not move a cell because the net charge of the cell is zero. However, a non-uniform field moves the positive ions, inside each cell, to one side and the negative ions to the opposite side producing a dipole. Once the dipole is induced, a net force is exerted on the cell because the intensity of the field is greater on one side than the other. The movement of cells in one direction causes the cells to concentrate in an area. Since the cells are now dipoles the negative side of one cell will attract the positive side of another cell over coming the negative surface charge. Fig. 1\nillustrates the principles. In Fig. 1(A) A low-voltage alternating current (AC) is delivered to mixed cell suspensions of transformed B cells and myeloma cells, (B) cell mixtures in the field result in myeloma/B cell contact, and (C) the resulting fields cause the formation of \u201cpearl chains\u201d of mixed cells. After establishing close contact using AC current, a large electroporating direct current (DC) pulse is delivered (Fig. 1(A)), followed by maintenance of contact with delivery of AC pulses again for a time. After membrane resealing, some myeloma cells will have fused with an antigen-specific B cell.",

Investigators noted that plasmablasts, normally not found in peripheral blood in substantial numbers, occurred in high frequency in the blood of subjects who had been vaccinated with influenza vaccine about a week prior. The timing of the circulation of these cells suggested that they likely possessed genes specific for the vaccine antigens, and molecular cloning of the expressed antibody genes subsequently proved that influenza-specific antibody genes were common in these cells. This technique promises to yield a large number of antibodies to influenzas for which conventional or experimental vaccines can be used as immunogens in humans. It is not clear at this time whether the circulating pool of plasmablasts in patients with chronic infections (such as HIV or hepatitis C) is enriched in antigen-specific clones. It is also not established that these cells can be transformed efficiently; therefore direct cloning of antibody genes followed by expression of antibodies is required for screening.",

This virus, and antigenically similar viruses, circulated in humans for the first several decades of the 20th century. Therefore it is expected that 1918 pandemic survivors would have been exposed and probably infected by similar viruses on multiple occasions during childhood and the early adult years. However, it has been over a half century since antigenically related viruses have circulated in humans. Surprisingly, nearly all of the extreme elderly subjects we examined (but not younger subjects) possessed 1918-specific B cells in the peripheral blood. The frequency was low, with an average of about 1 in 5 million circulating cells that were 1918 HA-specific. To some extent, these studies raise more questions than they answer. What signals maintain the B cells in circulation? Do early 20th century influenza antigens persist in these subjects? Are these subjects genetically unusual in some way? Isolation of antibodies and their sequences only provide a glimpse into the nature of immune memory, but not into the mechanisms that maintain it.",

Most interestingly, the antibody gene sequences possess a high number of somatic mutations, nearly three times the average number of mutations found in the sequences of human memory B cells. Intuitively one might speculate that a high number of somatic mutations would facilitate a high affinity of binding, and we found this to be true. Biosensor studies reveal that these antibodies interact with extraordinary affinity with recombinant HA molecules. Finally, we tested whether the high affinity of interaction correlated with a high functional activity. Indeed, some of these antibodies exhibited ultra-potent neutralizing activity against 1918 virus and other early 20th century H1N1 viruses, when measured by HAI or neutralizing antibody assays in vitro or protection against lethal challenge in mice.",

            "text": "Typically, influenza neutralizing antibodies recognize variable loops on the HA protein head that surround the sialic acid receptor binding site. Five major antigenic sites have been previously defined using murine monoclonal antibodies and designated sites Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb (Fig. 2\n). Using generation of antibody escape mutants coupled with HA gene sequence analysis, and other techniques, we have identified that the 1918 virus-specific human antibodies bind principally to the Sa and Sb antigenic sites. These data suggest that these potent inhibiting antibodies bind to conventional sites located in highly accessible but also variable loops. Interestingly, some of the binding appears to involve residues that flank the classical sites, suggesting human antibodies may interface with the HA with a somewhat broader interface and more articulated surface than murine antibodies. Ongoing structural studies will reveal the exact nature of interactions and the extent of shape complementarity that the human antibodies are able to achieve. One of the surprising features of the epitope studies is the fact that one of the antibodies, designated 1F1 exhibits a low level of cross-reactivity for a number of H1N1 viruses over the 20th century. This antibody, unexpectedly, binds and inhibits virus as far apart as 1918 and 1977 H1N1 viruses, although the activity is highest against the 1918 strain. A better understanding of the structural basis for this cross-reactivity could suggest conserved elements of the H1 HA molecule on which we could focus vaccine development for a vaccine that induces broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Isolation of additional cross-reactive antibodies to the head domain of influenza is a high priority if we are to understand the structural basis for conservation of these otherwise cryptic conserved epitopes.",
