            "text": "Pyrithiobac (PTB) is a particular thioether compound in that the sulfur atom is connected by a phenyl ring and a pyrimidine ring, which in fact is a powerful herbicide used in cotton fields with excellent selectivity [7]. The target of this herbicide is acetehydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, EC 2.2.1.6), a special biological enzyme that exists only in plants and microbes [8]. A recent crystallography study showed that PTB binds with plant AHAS in a similar cavity provided by two neighboring subunits [9]. Nevertheless, PTB derivatives have not been fully explored till now. As is known, compounds containing heterocycle ring such as pyrimidine or triazine often show diverse agricultural or medicinal activities. For instances, pyramat is a successful insecticide with a pyrimidine ring developed in the 1960s and anilazine is a traditional fungicide with a triazine ring that have been used for over 60 years [10,11]. Recently, some aromatic disulfides with pyrimidine ring (example-d) were discovered to be potent inhibitors of main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV Mpro) [12]. The chemical structures of dimethyl sulfide, phenyl sulfide, diallyl sulfide, methionine, example-a, example-b, example-c, pyrithiobac, pyramat, anilazine and example-d mentioned above are shown in Fig. 1\n.",

To our delight, the title compounds exhibited multiple bioactivities, against agricultural weeds, insects, pathogenic plant fungi or plant virus, and medicinal infections caused by fungus or SARS-associated coronavirus. For compounds that showed remarkable activity against SARS-CoV Mpro, very low cellular cytotoxicity was observed against mammalian 293 T cells. In addition, the chemical structure of 6\u20136 was elucidated clearly from single crystal X-ray diffraction, which evidently indicated that these PTB derivatives were chemically prepared successfully. Molecular simulations were performed and it was found that HOMO-1 might contribute to AHAS inhibition from DFT calculation and a plausible binding mode of inhibitor 6\u20135 with SARS-CoV Mpro was generated via molecular docking.",

Although 2 and 3 were commercially available, they were chemically synthesized in our laboratory. Various mercaptobenzonitriles 2 were prepared from corresponding fluorobenzonitriles 1 via a nucleophilic substitution attacked by a sulfhydryl group provided by sodium sulfide nonahydrate to give desirable outputs. 2 were further hydrolyzed under alkaline condition from mercaptobenzonitriles to mercaptobenzoic acids 3 with satisfactory yields. Some intermediates were hard to be purified and were used directly in the following reaction. According to the literature [13], hydrolysis of 2 occurs easily under the condition of 15% sodium hydroxide at 150 \u00b0C, however, this reaction was not observed until the condition was changed to 30% sodium hydroxide at 175 \u00b0C with 0.9 equivalent of sodium sulfide nonahydrate added to the solution in an autoclave reactor. It should be noted that when there is a trifluoromethyl group in the ortho or para position of the hydrosulphonyl group of 2, the trifluoromethyl group itself will be hydrolyzed at the same time when the cyanogroup is hydrolyzed, however when the trifluoromethyl group is at the meta position of the hydrosulphonyl group, the hydrolysis of trifluoromethyl group does not happen, which has been confirmed by the final compounds. This is in agreement with an early report by Jones in 1947 [14]. The synthesis and characterizations of the intermediates 2 and 3 are detailed in the supplementary material.",

Compound 6\u201334 and 6\u201335 were also started from 4, with substituted phenyl 2\u2032 as the nucleophile, potassium hydroxide as the base in tetrahydrofuran [16]. In all these three routes, the chlorine atom in the triazine ring is attacked and substituted by the hydrosulphonyl or hydroxyl group in 2, 2\u2032 and 3. For the synthesis of compound 6\u201322 to 6\u201333, intermediate 2 or 3 reacted with 4,6-dimethoxy-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine 5 in ethanol to give the final product, which is also a nucleophilic substitution but in this case the leaving group is a methanesulfonyl group in the pyrimidine ring and the corresponding base is sodium bicarbonate [17].

In contrast, PTB itself was a very weak inhibitor of this enzyme, the inhibition of which was only 40% at 100 \u03bcM. This is close to the reported data by Garcia et al. [18]. The other control ethoxysulfuron, one of the best AHAS inhibitors to date, had 96.8% inhibition even at 10 \u03bcM concentration. Among the target compounds, 6\u20131, 6\u20133, 6\u20135, 6\u20139, 6\u201314, 6\u201317, 6\u201318, 6\u201322 and 6\u201327 had some antifungal activities from the YNB media cell based assay. For the anti-Candida activity, there is some difference between the results from RPMI 1640 media and that from YNB media, and from the latter the activity is higher. It is known that, YNB media does not contain the BCAAs while RPMI media contains these amino acids, therefore there will be a shift of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between the data from the two medias if AHAS inhibition is the cause of the antifungal activity. The results here indicated that the observed anti-Candida activity was due to this reason, which is also in accordance with our previous report [19]. When the observation time changed to 48 h instead of 24 h, MIC data increased to different extent (data now shown), which means that the anti-Candida activity here was an inhibitory effect, not a fungicidal effect. There exists a strong correlation between the fungal AHAS inhibition data and the antifungal activity for 6\u20139, 6\u201322 and 6\u201327. No antifungal activity was found for any compound with very weak AHAS inhibition. For comparison, PTB did not have any inhibitory activity in the cell based assay at all the conditions, however, ethoxysulfuron was a very potent inhibitor in the YNB media, with MIC values of 0.39 mg/L against all the three fungal isolates. These experimental results were similar to the reported potencies of the two commercial AHAS inhibitors [18,19].",

At 10 \u03bcM concentration, compound 6\u201321, 6\u201322 and 6\u201324 still contributed >60% AHAS inhibition. For the in vivo herbicidal activity, compound 6\u201322, 6\u201324, 6\u201325, 6\u201334 and 6\u201335 displayed >80% rape root growth inhibitory activity at 100 mg/L dosage, while compound 6\u20134, 6\u20135, 6\u20139, 6\u201310, 6\u201316, 6\u201318, 6\u201323, 6\u201326, 6\u201328 and 6\u201329 possessed >50% herbicidal activity.

As can be seen, PTB was not only a very strong inhibitor of plant AHAS, but also an extremely potent herbicide. Taken together the plant AHAS inhibition data and herbicidal activity, 6\u201322 and 6\u201324 were subjected to greenhouse pot assay for further evaluation, which is illustrated in Table S1. At 300 g/ha dosage, these two compounds displayed potent herbicidal activities, in both pre-emergence and post-emergence assays for dicot weed species Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexu. Interestingly, 6\u201324 also showed 72.3% inhibition against monocot Echinochloacrus-galli from the post-emergence assay. For comparison, the herbicidal activity of PTB was much stronger even at the dosage of 30 g/ha, with the only exception of the post-emergence activity against Echinochloacrus-galli.",

Meanwhile, the commercial sulfonylurea herbicide ethoxysulfuron is also a potent a strong anti-Candida agent. This implied that the two family of herbicidal AHAS inhibitors are different when subjected to fungal inhibition. Nevertheless, here the synthesized new derivatives demonstrated some interesting difference with PTB. For instance, 6\u201322 was more potent regarding the fungal AHAS and anti-Candida activity than PTB was, while the herbicidal activity of 6\u201322 was significantly weaker than that of PTB. In both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS inhibition tests, 6\u201322 was one of the best inhibitor. For 6\u201322, there is a fluorine atom at the para position of the sulfur atom, while for PTB, a chlorine atom locates at the meta position of the sulfur atom. This minor structural difference has led to significant difference in their biological activities. A compound that combines the feature of PTB and 6\u201322 has been designed, which has fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms at both para and meta positions of the sulfur atom in the molecule. This new compound is expected to have improved AHAS inhibition.",

It should be pointed out that the media for this assay contains the amino acids and we failed to try these assays under YNB media, therefore antifungal activity determined here does not necessarily have direct relationship with AHAS inhibition, or AHAS inhibition might not be the sole factor. Although 6\u201322 was not subjected to the plant fungi assay, there were some overlaps between the anti-Candida activity and antifungal activities against plant fungi disease, such as 6\u20133, 6\u20135 and 6\u201327. Obviously, C. albicans and the plant pathogenic fungi are different species. PTB did not exhibit any anti-Candida activity, but it was an inhibitor of R. cerealis.",

Among the title compounds, 6\u201322 showed potent inhibitions for both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS, as well as its desirable anti-Candida activity and herbicidal activity. Meanwhile, 6\u20138 and 6\u201312 were very weak inhibitors towards both AHASs, and no in vivo activities were observed. These compounds were then subjected to theoretical calculations by means of DFT/B3LYP method. From the crystal structure of PTB bound with A. thaliana AHAS, it is clear that the pyrimidine ring forms a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with a neighboring residue Trp574 [9], which means that the pyrimidine ring or the triazine ring in the newly synthesized compounds might be involved in this interaction. The HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 of these compounds were drawn Fig. 4\nor Fig. S1. Comparisons of these maps revealed that here HOMO-1 might be an important factor in AHAS inhibition. For 6\u201322, HOMO-1 covers not only the pyrimidine ring, but also the phenyl ring, whereas for 6\u20138 and 6\u201312, the HOMO-1s only distribute in the heterocycle ring (Fig. 4). This suggests that 6\u201322 is possible to have more interactions with the enzyme than 6\u20138 and 6\u201312 do. However for HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 maps (seen in Fig. S1), there are either no obvious differences (HOMO and LUMO+1), or the difference is in conflict with the known \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with W574 (LUMO). Based on these thoughts, it is concluded that HOMO-1 is a non-negligible element for the further molecular design of AHAS-inhibiting PTB derivatives.",

            "text": "Because neither PTB nor its derivative has previously been reported to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV Mpro, little is known about the binding mode. Now that we have identified that a lot of the target compounds are good inhibitors of this enzyme and 6\u20135 even showed very low cellular cytotoxicity, it is interesting to dock the inhibitor to the binding site to investigate the probable mode of action. FlexX is a fast, flexible docking method that uses an incremental construction algorithm to place ligands into an active site [24], which has been used previously to successfully predict the binding modes of several families of inhibitors [12,19,25]. This program was utilized to divine the binding mode in this study. Fig. 5\na is a two-dimensional illustration of the interactions between 6\u20135 and the surrounding residues of SARS-CoV Mpro drawn by LIGPLOT [26]. As can be seen, multiple hydrophobic interactions were formed by 6\u20135 with Thr26, Leu27, Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, His163, Glu166 and His172, while four intermolecular hydrogen bonds could be seen between 6\u20135 and Asn142, Ser144 and Cys145. Fig. 5b shows the three-dimensional molecular surface of the cavity generated by PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, South San Francisco, CA), and 6\u20135 adopted a relaxed conformation to inhabit in the cavity. The predicted binding mode has provided meaningful information for design more potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors.",

            "text": "Previous studies on pyrithiobac and its derivatives mostly focused on their herbicidal use. Since thioether compounds are always associated with considerable biological activities, it is necessary to investigate different bioactivities to widen their agricultural or medicinal use. As PTB itself is a highly safe compound towards mammals, compounds with similar structures are expected to have biologically safe property. In this research, a total of 35 PTB derivatives were synthesized and characterized, and this is the first time that such derivatives have been evaluated comprehensively against different bioassays. The target compounds were found to have anti-Candida activity, herbicidal activity, antifungal activity against plant fungi, insecticidal activity, anti-TMV activity and inhibitions against SARS-CoV Mpro. As a promising AHAS inhibitor, 6\u201322 exhibited desirable C. albicans inhibition and potent herbicidal activity. Interestingly, 6\u201326 displayed potent antifungal activity against plant pathogenic diseases. 6\u201322 also showed desirable passivation efficacies against TMV. Furthermore, some compound such as 6\u20135 was identified to be potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV Mpro. From a DFT calculation, HOMO-1 might have impact on AHAS inhibitory activity. A feasible binding mode was constructed to explain the interaction of 6\u20135 with SARS-CoV Mpro. Overall, because 6\u20135 displayed activities from all the bioassays and its cell cytotoxicity data was very low, it is regarded as a lead compound for further molecular design.",

All solvents and liquid reagents were dried in advance using standard methods and distilled before use. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate was dried and stored in a drying column before use. Melting points were determined using an RT-2 melting apparatus and were uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR were obtained using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shift values (d) for the NMR spectra were reported as parts per million (ppm), using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO\u2011d\n6) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference standard. Mass spectra were recorded on an Ionspect FT-MS 7.0 T LC/mass detector instrument. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer. The synthesis of intermediate 2 and 3 is depicted in Scheme 1 and the experimental data are detailed in the supplementary material. The synthesis for target PTB derivatives is shown in Scheme 2 and the experimental details are stated below.",
