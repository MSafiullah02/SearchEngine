POCT development has often been driven by technological innovation rather than in response to a clearly defined unmet clinical need, and as a consequence many POCTS have not been taken up into routine clinical care. There are also some clinical niches where POCTs are urgently required. For example, there is a need for improved POCTs to help primary care clinicians to safely reduce and better target antibiotic prescribing for common infections such as community acquired lower respiratory tract infections (CA-LRTIs) [3] , [4] . CA-LRTIs are one of the leading acute reasons for consulting in primary care, and 20%-95% of patients are prescribed an antibiotic [5] , [6] . More than 80% of these antibiotics may be unnecessary as CA-LRTIs in developed countries are largely self-limiting and the majority of patients do not benefit meaningfully from antibiotic treatment [7] , [8] , [9] . A rapid POCT that is feasible for use in primary care consultations that helps clinicians decide when antibiotics can safely be withheld, or when antibiotic treatment is likely to benefit patients, could improve care of this common and important condition and help combat antibiotic resistance.",

This information, summarised in a target product profile (TPP), should guide test development so that it matches clinical need and safely improves outcomes in priority conditions. [12] . TPPs for diagnosing infections disease have been developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and M\u00e9decines sans Fronti\u00e9res (MSF) [13] [14] [15] and others through the identification of stakeholders for consultation, priority setting to identify the highest priority for test development, defining operational and technical test characteristics, discussing disputed criteria, and obtaining final consensus [16, 17] . To formalise TTP's and ensure their verification (consistency and completeness) formal modelling approaches have also been helpful [18] [19] . However, as yet, there is no consensus on the priority CA-LRTI where a POCT is most urgently needed, the ideal process for developing a POCT TPP, and there is no published TPP for a CA-LRTI for use in developed countries. Our experience of developing a TPP for the exemplar condition of CA-LRTI illustrates how a TPP can be generated to inform the development of a new POCT.",
