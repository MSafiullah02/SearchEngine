We present our protocol modifications for evaluation, management, and hospital care of acute ischemic stroke patients in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The bedside evaluator remains in the patient's room during transport to the computed tomography (CT) scanner to minimize repeated donning / doffing of PPE, which both conserves resources and limits accidental exposure. Upon the patient's return, communication between the bedside evaluator and the stroke attending or fellow is facilitated by use of a telephone or tablet already located within the room. This differs significantly from our typical approach, which includes the immediate arrival of multiple Stroke Team members to the bedside for a comprehensive initial evaluation and assistance in transport to the CT scanner. These changes greatly reduce the number of team members exposed and the amount of PPE consumed in the process of initial evaluation and management in the acute stroke setting.",

Clinical features suggestive of increased risk include location of infarct within the cerebellum, large hemispheric infarction, and presentation with alteration in level of consciousness. 4 For patients that meet any of these parameters but do not require intensive care unit (ICU) level of care, a tablet with video capabilities is placed at the bedside. Once per shift, a neurologist uses this device to remotely observe a bedside nurse perform a neurologic check to calibrate the exam, as well as to determine the frequency of required examinations for the remainder of the shift. Any concern raised during a nursing evaluation prompts a bedside evaluation by a member of the Stroke Team. For patients lacking high-risk features, neurologic examination will take place when bedside nursing staff enters the room to perform other care tasks, which is approximately once every four hours.",

However, as the number of ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients has increased, ICU bed availability has dwindled, making it necessary to identify which patients may be suitable for monitoring outside of an intensive care unit. The recent OPTIMIST trial sought to define a subgroup of patients who are able to be monitored less closely after receiving thrombolytic therapy, ultimately finding that patients meeting the criteria we have adopted were able to remain in a step-down level of care without adverse events. 7 Our own experience is in agreement: we observed a 3% complication rate in patients monitored at our institution after receiving IV rtPA, (and less than 1% when it was administered at our institution) during 2018 strokes in need of mechanical thrombectomy. However, even with rapid testing, a positive or negative determination will not result prior to skin puncture, requiring that all patients going to the neurointerventional radiology suite from the ED for emergent mechanical thrombectomy be considered as PUI for COVID-19. We have not incorporated routine chest CT as a screening tool in these patients given the nonspecific findings and wide range of reported sensitivities, a decision supported by the American College of Radiology. 9 In line with societal guidance statements, adjustments of care are indicated based on the patient's COVID-19 status, including airway assessment and potential need for intubation. 10 Under normal circumstances, the Stroke Team accompanies the patient to the NIR suite to facilitate active collaboration with the neuro-interventional team during the case. However, given the confines of the control room area and the positive-pressure environment of the NIR suite, this communication is now conducted via telephone. Staff who remain in the control room wear a Ford 8 surgical mask. After the procedure, the neuro-interventional team performs two skin puncture site and pulse evaluations separated by 15 minutes to assess for early complications. These patients are then triaged to either a step-down level of care or to the intensive care unit, again based on an assessment of relative risk (Figure 3) . Upon arrival at their designated care unit, nursing performs a skin puncture site evaluation and neurologic check, which is repeated one hour later. Beyond this time period, patients will be evaluated every two hours until eight hours after completion of the procedure, at which point they are further spaced to evaluation every four hours. These intervals can be adjusted based on physician concern for access site bleeding or patient stability.",

As with the modifications to our post-intravenous rtPA protocol, these changes allow for reduced consumption of intensive care unit beds and resources while maintaining acute ischemic stroke treatment capabilities.",

These measures allow for a reduction in the number of technicians and other staff facing potential exposure while minimally impacting the care of our patients.",
