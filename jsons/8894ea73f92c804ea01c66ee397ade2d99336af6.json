We investigated the protective effect and usefulness of loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compression. Methods: This was a single-center simulation study performed from May 2019 to July 2019 in a tertiary hospital. We measured the concentrations of ambient aerosol and particles inside the loose-fitting PAPR during chest compression, and this ratio was set as the simulated workplace protecting factor (SWPF). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulations, the assigned protection factor (APF) of loose-fitting PAPRs is 25. Thus, the loose-fitting PAPRs were assumed to have a protective effect when the SWPF were \u2265 250 (APF \u00d7 10). We measured the SWPF of PAPR in real time during chest compression and also investigated the problems encountered during its use. Results: Ninety-one participants (median age 29 [interquartile range (IQR): 26-32] years; 74% female) completed the simulation. None of the participants failed with SWPF below 250 during three sessions of chest compression. The median (IQR) values of SWPF at three cycles were 17,063 (10,145-26,373), 15,683 (9477-32,394), and 16,960 (7695-27,279). There was no disconnection of equipment or mechanical failures during chest compression. In addition, most participants (83%) replied that they rarely or never experienced difficulty in verbal communication and felt that the loose-fitting PAPR was comfortable.

There is a concern about potential risk of wearer exposure to contaminants if the breathing rate of the wearer exceeds the air flow rate supplied by the PAPR fan [9, 12] . In such an instance, ambient air could bypass the filters and enter the mask potentially exposing the wearer to contamination. Moreover, chest compressions are dynamic and fast that the inhalation flow during higher work rates could exceed the air flow supplied by the PAPR. Mackey et al.

Their measurements showed that even when peak inspiratory flow rate exceeded the blower flow rate, the concentration of aerosol within the PAPR remained below 0.1% of the ambient concentration. Thus, they assumed that the hood contributed a large dead volume that acted as a buffer against inward leakage of ambient aerosol.
