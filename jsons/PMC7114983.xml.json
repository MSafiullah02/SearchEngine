This allows testing for other herpesviruses that may cause a similar clinical picture (e.g., varicella-zoster virus), and to exclude HSV involvement in the evaluation of oral lesions that could result from other causes such as drug toxicity. Esophagitis, pneumonitis and hepatitis are also frequently best diagnosed through the use of immunohisto-chemical staining for HSV-specific antigens on biopsy specimens. In these settings, HSV may be a part of a dual infection (e.g., with Candida species, other viruses). Cultures are of little value in disease involving organs beyond the mucocutaneous barrier. Cultures from respiratory specimens, in particular, can be misleading if positive, given the frequency of asymptomatic shedding of the virus from the oropharynx in immunocompromised individuals. Disease involving the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently diagnosed by molecular amplification assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The sensitivity and specificity of HSV PCR from CSF is thought to be close to 95% [13], though specimens taken early or late in the clinical course may be more likely to be falsely negative [14]. Brain biopsy with immunohistochemical staining remains definitive for HSV encephalitis if PCR is unrevealing and diagnosis is essential. Ocular disease is often made on clinical examination, though PCR of cell scrapings in keratoconjunctivitis or vitreous fluid in the case of retinal disease may also play a role [15].",

Minor herpes labialis infections can spread rapidly to the pharynx, the esophagus, and via the bloodstream to multiple organs and cutaneous dermatomes. The most widely available agents for treatment of HSV infections are nucleoside analogues that inhibit the synthesis of HSV viral DNA. The most frequently used agent by far is acyclovir, though valacyclovir, famciclovir, vidarabine, and foscarnet can be used depending on the clinical scenario (Table 2-4). Intravenous therapy should be considered as initial therapy for progressive or disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts.\n",

Famciclovir is the diacetyl ester prodrug of penciclovir and is rapidly converted by the body. Vidarabine was the first antiherpesvirus drug to be of proven value, but is rarely used in clinical practice due to inferiority in clinical trials to acyclovir and significant toxicities, including neurotoxicity with parasthesias, ataxia, seizures, and rarely coma [16, 17]. Foscarnet is a direct noncompetitive inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerase and has in vitro activity against all herpesviruses. Foscarnet undergoes little intracellular metabolism, and is not dependent on the herpetic thymidine kinase (required to phosphorylate acyclovir to the active state) and therefore may be used in the treatment of acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV that arise due to mutations in the viral thymidine kinase. The utility of foscarnet is limited by nephrotoxicity, symptomatic hypocalcemia, and other electrolyte (magnesium, potassium) losses that require co-infusion with a large amount of fluid.",

Individual laboratories may vary in their approach. Overall, serologic tests are not as clinically useful in rapidly diagnosing VZV as PCR and antigen detection. Most cases of VZV in the immunocompromised occur as a result of viral reactivation; serologic testing to determine those at risk for primary infection is not 100% reliable in these hosts [29]. Though the exact sensitivity and specificity of PCR from CSF for VZV is unclear, PCR is becoming relied upon by more and more physicians for diagnosing CNS infections due to herpesviruses in general. The VZV PCR assay is likely most useful earlier in the patient\u2019s clinical course, particularly if primary infection is suspected and seroconversion may be delayed [30, 31]. PCR can also be used to distinguish infection between wild-type VZV and that of the vaccine strain [32].",

Patients improving on this regimen may be converted to oral therapy with either acyclovir at 800 mg po 5x/day or valacyclovir 1 g po tid to complete the course. Famciclovir at a dose of 500 mg po tid may also be of value in this setting. The latter agents (famciclovir and valacyclovir) have better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. Most experts recommend extending therapy for at least 2 days beyond crusting of all lesions. Resistance is rare, reported most often in patients with underlying HIV infection [26].

Vaccination with the live VZV vaccine should be considered in advance of immune suppression but cannot be used in immunocompromised hosts. In VZV-seronegative patients, administration of VZIG as soon as possible within 96 h after exposure is indicated [33]. Some experts also report using those VZIG in HSCT patients with a significant exposure who are already known to be seropositive, but are often hypogammaglobulinemic. Significant exposures include contacts with individuals with chicken pox or who received the live VZV vaccine and subsequently developed a varicella-like rash with the risk of transmitting the vaccine-related strain of VZV [33]. Dosing of VZIG is 125 international units per 10 kg of body weight with a maximum dose of 625 units and a minimum dose of 125 units given intramuscularly.

Prevention in most immunocompetent individuals is now through the use of the live, attenuated VZV vaccine. Though different formulations exist, all vaccines use the Oka strain of VZV isolated from a healthy child with varicella and then attenuated through sequential passage in cell culture [26]. Currently, live vaccine is contraindicated for use among HSCT recipients and other immunocompromised individuals. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of the VZV vaccine in this population. Ideally, however, all healthcare workers, family members of patients, or other household contacts who are VZV-seronegative should be immunized as soon as the decision is made to perform HSCT. Completion of the vaccine should be done 4 or more weeks before the conditioning regimen begins [33]. An inactivated vaccine is under development.",

Cell culture techniques using human fibroblast cell lines are time-consuming, with results in 10 days to as long as 4\u20136 weeks in order to detect the cytopathic changes indicative of a positive assay. Shell vial cultures allow detection of CMV antigens prior to the development of cytopathic changes. The overall sensitivity and specificity are limited by the frequency of asymptomatic shedding in immunocompromised hosts in respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal sites [47]. Molecular-based techniques such as antigenemia assays, nucleic acid amplification, and hybrid capture assays are commonly used in the diagnosis of active CMV disease. The antigenemia assay is limited in the setting of profound neutropenia because of the lack of circulating granulocytes. Though exact predictive values of these tests may vary depending on what study is referenced, all appear to have a high sensitivity and specificity in immunocompromised patients [48\u201350] and in patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT [51]. PCR from whole blood tends to be a more sensitive assay than the others, but less specific than plasma when used for molecular amplification. The pp65 antigenemia assay, when not limited by neutropenia, may be the most specific in terms of predicting active disease [51]. PCR, the hybrid capture assay, and the antigenemia assay are all likely useful in monitoring a patient\u2019s response to therapy. Viral loads may take several weeks to become undetectable on therapy, however [52, 53], and retesting a patient less than 1 week after initiation of treatment is generally not advised.",

            "text": "Although the use of CMV-negative and leukocyte-depleted blood products can help prevent CMV infection in seronegative patients, the risk is never reduced to zero. Prophylaxis and preemptive treatment have reduced the significant morbidity and mortality associated with CMV disease in this population. Late CMV disease post-HSCT remains a significant risk for mortality and likely reflects ongoing immune dysfunction and ineffective T-cell control of viral replication [59]. Risk factors include ongoing pharmacological immunosuppression such as high-dose corticosteroids, graft versus host disease (GVHD), need for donor lymphocyte infusions, and previous CMV disease. Prophylaxis with IV ganciclovir for up to 100 days post-transplant has been effective in preventing reactive CMV infection in seropositive HSCT recipients [60], as has use of oral acyclovir and valacyclovir [61, 62]. Many centers, however, advocate the preemptive approach in order to avoid unnecessary toxicity from prolonged antiviral drug use. Testing the blood of at-risk patients on a regular basis using molecular amplification or antigen detection techniques can often uncover low-level asymptomatic viremia that may be amenable to antiviral therapy before symptomatic CMV disease can evolve. IV ganciclovir and valganciclovir have been used, though there are no large randomized, comparative studies completed in the HSCT population regarding valganciclovir for this purpose [63].",

The use of corticosteroids to reduce tonsillar swelling and airway compromise is sometimes necessary [96]. Steroids and antiviral therapy may be employed with other life-threatening complications such as hepatitis and possible liver failure, hematologic crises including aplastic anemia or hemolysis, though there are no prospective studies to support their use. In the immunocompromised individual, therapeutic modalities are diverse and are frequently indicated to either prevent or treat the lymphoproliferative complications and risk for malignancy from EBV. Both acyclovir and ganciclovir have in vitro activity against lytic replication of EBV, with ganciclovir having slightly greater efficacy [97]. However, there are few data to suggest that antivirals have a significant effect on the outcome of infection. EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies in immunocompromised hosts are thought to be dependent on latent infection that relies on cellular enzymes for EBV episomal DNA synthesis, and thus are not inhibited by the routine anti-herpesvirus nucleoside analogues [96]. Both acyclovir and ganciclovir have been used for prophylaxis in patients after solid organ transplantation, with meta-analyses suggesting a benefit to universal prophylaxis against CMV in preventing PTLD [98]. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn because of the small size and heterogeneity of the patient populations and non-randomized nature of these studies. Induction of the EBV thymidine kinase gene through the use of compounds such as arginine butyrate has been attempted in order to induce susceptibility to antiviral therapy with a mixed degree of success [99, 100]. Another antiviral that has been investigated in in vitro assays and in case reports is high-dose zidovudine (AZT) [101]. Maribavir, a newer compound being investigated for the use of treating CMV, also has in vitro activity against EBV through a different mechanism of action than the nucleoside analogues [102]. Yet, there are no trials investigating its use in EBV infection.",

The use of antiviral therapy in established disease may be used to reduce active viral replication and resultant immunosuppression but does not appear to directly impact tumor progression. In solid organ transplant recipients, CMV is a co-factor for PTLD, and prevention or treatment of CMV may be of benefit. The use of rituximab as a preemptive approach in HSCT to prevent PTLD in patients with otherwise asymptomatic but persistent EBV viremia has not always yielded persistent control in many patients [104].

There are case reports of antiviral therapy, but no general conclusions are merited [112, 119]. For established Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and lymphoproliferative disorders due to HHV-8, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been used with some success. Intralesional injections of cidofovir have had little effect in Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma compared with the benefit of liposomal doxorubicin, though recurrence and resistant disease have been described with the latter [120]. For primary effusion lymphomas, resistance to traditional chemotherapy is common, and response rates are lower [121]. Therapies targeting latent viral gene expression are under study. Activation of lytic gene expression to make the virus more sensitive to traditional antiviral therapies, similar to EBV, is also under investigation. Hydroxyurea may have activity against latently infected cells in some cases, although resistance has developed frequently [122]. Use of interferon (\u2212\u03b1 or \u2212\u03b3) may be able to trigger cell death in infected HHV-8 cells in vitro, but has not undergone clinical evaluation [123]. In HIV infection, immune reconstitution through the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has had a salutatory effect on the treatment and prevention of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and HHV-8. Immune reconstitution through decreased immunosuppression may also be of benefit in patients with HHV-8-related disease post-transplant.",

To diagnose a recent infection with antibodies, however, acute and convalescent sera for testing are required in order to document a \u2265 4-fold increase over time. Serotype-specific neutralizing antibody assays may be useful in therapeutic decision-making. Cultures can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract, conjunctiva, stool, urine, CSF, or other sites. Samples from the stool and urine, in particular, need to be interpreted with caution. Ongoing shedding in asymptomatic immunocompromised individuals limits the utility of culture-based diagnostics. Antigen detection assays can be much more rapid, but lag in sensitivity. Tests for use in conjunctival samples suggest an overall sensitivity of 38%, though this rate was higher when taken earlier in the illness [133]. Among respiratory specimens, the sensitivity of antigen testing may also be relatively low compared to testing for other respiratory viral pathogens. The specificity and predictive values remain close to 100%, however, and ultimately the value of the test is most likely dependent on the adequacy of the sample taken [134]. PCR is emerging as the method of choice for detecting active adenoviral disease from any infected site.

Cidofovir has significant nephrotoxicity, while ribavirin has bone marrow toxicity, risk for anemia, and is a teratogen. Cidofovir appears to be the most active agent against adenovirus in vitro, and clinical experience suggests the capacity to reduce viremia and viruria with subsequent clinical improvement in some patients. Various serotypes differ in response to cidofovir. Dosing and length of therapy remain unclear. Doses of 5 mg/kg given IV once weekly for two to three doses, followed by infusions every other week, has been most often cited [138]. Cidofovir is usually given concomitantly with probenecid to help prevent some of the renal toxicity of the drug. Hemorrhagic cystitis may be relapsing with immune function, and hydration with urine flow is an essential component of care in these individuals. Despite some case reports, topical administration of antiviral agents has not proven very helpful in therapy of this common syndrome.",

Usual treatment in the immunocompetent individual is for 5 days, but in the immunocompromised patient, particularly in HSCT recipients or patients with complicated disease, more prolonged therapy may be warranted [63]. Data specifically in HSCT recipients suggest that early therapy using oseltamivir can possibly reduce viral shedding and risk for pneumonia [165]. The adamantanes, amantidine, and rimantidine, are classified as M2 inhibitors and are efficacious against influenza A only. Although they are less expensive than the neuraminidase inhibitors, they are limited by increasing rates of resistance. In January of 2006, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued an alert to avoid the use of M2 inhibitors during the 2005\u20132006 influenza season in the United States due to unacceptably high rates of resistance seen in the H3N2 strain circulating at the time. The same precaution has been recommended for the 2006\u20132007 season as well, until further more definitive susceptibility testing can be established. All of the above agents have also been used for prophylaxis during outbreaks, though dosing, length of therapy, and susceptibilities of circulating strains may vary.",

Symptoms are generally self-limited and consist of upper respiratory tract-related complaints: rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, pharyngitis and cough. Although these viruses are thought to be limited to the upper respiratory tract for replication, reports isolating them from the lower respiratory tract do exist [178\u2013180]. The outcome of infection due to rhinoviruses or coronaviruses in patients with hematologic malignancies is not well characterized. The incidence of severe infection due to rhinoviruses is unknown. Fatal pneumonia has been attributed to infection from rhinoviruses in patients who have undergone HSCT [181]. Use of reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for rhinoviruses and coronaviruses in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients who have undergone HSCT suggests that isolation of rhinoviruses from lower respiratory tract samples is associated with co-infection from other pathogens (e.g., bacteria, fungi and other viruses) [180]. The validity of RT-PCR in respiratory samples remains unclear. Most laboratories do not have the culture techniques or PCR available for the detection of these viruses in clinical samples. There is no established antiviral therapy for these infections.",

Because it is a live virus vaccine, it is generally avoided in immunocompromised individuals, though it is considered safe and effective in children who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia after they have been effectively treated with chemotherapy [182]. Sporadic cases of all three viruses occur. Measles, or rubeola, is typically associated with cough, coryza, fever, and a maculopapular rash. There are limited data on measles in immunocompromised patients. Cumulative case reports suggest that the case-fatality rate among oncology patients is as high as 70% [183]. Complications from the infection, including pneumonitis and encephalitis, may be more common. The typical rash of measles may be absent in immunocompromised patients, complicating the diagnosis. Serology, culture and RT-PCR can be used to diagnose measles. Serology is commonly available. Acute and convalescent sera are required to demonstrate the requisite fourfold increase over time to confirm the diagnosis. There is no known effective treatment for measles once infection is established. High-dose vitamin A when used in children has been reported to decrease the severity of the disease [184]. Ribavirin remains of unproven benefit [185].",

In HSCT, the combination of underlying T-cell dysfunction combined with suppressed humoral responses may contribute to more profound infection as well. However, the true incidence of enteroviral infections in this population remains unclear. Some estimate the incidence of enteroviral infections among HSCT recipients at 10%, though mortality is thought to be low overall and associated with coinfection of other pathogens.

Other methods such as immunofluorescent assays and EIA may show some cross-reactivity between the serotypes. The specificity of measuring serotypes also hampers the clinical utility of these tests. With 67 different serotypes known, routine diagnosis of enteroviruses with serology is not always realistic. Serologies are most useful when looking for evidence of polio infection. Culture can be labor-intensive and can require multiple cell lines to be effective [197]. Because excretion of enteroviruses from the gastrointestinal tract can persist after infection for as long as 8 weeks, [198, 199] isolation of the virus from stool, rectal swabs or possibly the oropharynx may result in a falsely positive assay. The same holds true for PCR when used in samples taken from these anatomic locations. Most experiences with PCR comes from CSF samples in cases of suspected aseptic meningitis where the sensitivity may be higher than culture and much more clinically useful [200].",

Previous investigations of specific antiviral therapy against enteroviruses resulted in the development of a compound known as pleconaril. Pleconaril acted by binding to the viral capsid antigen, impairing viral binding and uncoating [203].

Once ingested, the virus replicates in the gastrointestinal epithelium and then produces transient viremia, leading to infection of and further replication in the hepatocytes.

Occasionally, patients with active infection are found to have a negative hepatitis B surface antigen assay. These patients will usually have serologic evidence of hepatitis B core antibodies and low-level HBV DNA levels. This phenomenon is more common in patients with HBV and HIV coinfection [218]. The development of real-time PCR assays has created the most sensitive assays available for detecting HBV. HBV DNA levels as measured by PCR can be directly correlated to the risk of liver disease, death, and drug resistance in patients on therapy. Though baseline values may vary from individual to individual, monitoring on a regular basis may be useful, particularly in those patients on therapy. Although different algorithms exist, checking a patient\u2019s HBV viral load by PCR two to four times yearly while on therapy may provide an assessment of their response. Failure of an antiviral agent to achieve a 1 log or more decrease in viral load over 3 months, or a rebound of viral replication of 1 log or greater after an initial response is often considered evidence of failure [219]. Standardization of quantification in international units (IU)/mL will enhance comparison of different molecular assays [220].",

The second-generation EIA test is widely used with greater sensitivity than the first-generation assay [226]. A third-generation EIA can detect an additional HCV antigen, providing an advantage in high-prevalence settings and in detecting acute infections before seroconversion [227, 228]. Previously, confirmation of HCV infection in the setting of a positive serology was done through the use of a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-2). This immunoblot technique uses the same antigens detected by the second-generation EIA. The RIBA-2 increases the specificity of a positive EIA and reduces false positive results in low-prevalence settings or in patients with normal hepatic chemistries. More commonly now, detection of HCV RNA through the use of molecular amplification is used for confirmation and in patient management. Since patients with acute leukemia after HSCT may be less likely to develop antibody responses to HCV, PCR has significant advantages as a diagnostic tool [229]. Various molecular methods are not directly comparable, but single quantitative assays should be used in individuals. Commercially available assays include both RT-PCR and branched chain PCR methods. Branched chain PCR for HCV is technically easier, but less sensitive than standard RT-PCR techniques. A small percentage of patients with chronic infection have low-grade viremia that may not be detected [230]. PCR assays also have clinical utility in monitoring patients on therapy. Successful virologic response is generally defined as at least a 2 log decline from baseline levels 12 weeks into therapy, whereas those patients who do not experience the same decline are defined as nonresponders. Eradication of infection, or sustained virologic response, is also measured by use of the PCR assay and is defined by undetectable viral levels after completion of therapy and again 6 months later [231].",

HTLV-II has not been consistently linked to any significant disease process. Similar to HIV in that there is a tropism for CD4-positive T cells, HTLV does not lead to cell death, but rather promotes proliferation and transformation. It is endemic in Japan, Indonesia, the Middle East, and parts of the Caribbean, South America and Africa. Prevalence rates are less than 1% in nonendemic areas such as the United States. Transmission is thought to be primarily through breastfeeding, although spread via blood transfusion, transplantation, and sexual contact are factors in endemic areas.",

In patients with HIV infection and AIDS, a compatible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrating one or more white matter lesions without obvious contrast enhancement or mass effect suggests the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) scans tend to be less sensitive than MRI scanning [252]. Confirmation of PML and active JC virus infection is made through use of brain biopsy or JC virus molecular testing in CSF. Demyelination with intranuclear inclusions seen in the oligodendrocytes is typical, with or without necrosis and inflammation. In situ hybridization using JC virus DNA probes can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the biopsy findings [253]. Testing for circulating IgG antibodies is of little diagnostic value due to the ubiquity of infection. Likewise, routine CSF analysis is often unhelpful and may or may not reveal any changes consistent with active inflammation such as elevation of cell counts and protein levels. PCR analysis of CSF for JC virus DNA in immunocompromised patients with a consistent clinical history and radiographic findings is most often used to make the diagnosis. CSF PCR for JC virus has a sensitivity close to 90% and a high specificity [254]. Brian biopsy may be needed in the face of a negative CSF PCR to confirm a diagnosis.",

Asymptomatic BK viruria can be documented in other non-renal solid organ transplant recipients, elderly patients not on immunosuppression, HIV-infected patients, pregnant women and otherwise healthy individuals [266\u2013270]. BK viruria is uncommon in general and tends to be lower in quantity than in HSCT recipients with hemorrhagic cystitis [271, 272]. HSCT patients with hemorrhagic cystitis have high level viruria (100,000,000\u201310,000,000,000 copies/mL), and levels of 10,000,000 copies/mL correlate with risk for hemorrhagic cystitis in this patient population [271]. The pattern of BK viruria is also thought to be of potential significance. In one prospective cohort, some patients who went on to develop hemorrhagic cystitis invariably experienced a peaking of their BK viruria as measured by PCR in the 2\u20133 week period after HSCT, and before clinical hemorrhagic cystitis [273]. Measurement of plasma with PCR for the presence of BK virus may also show a correlation with the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. Levels greater than 10,000 copies/mL strongly correlated with post-engraftment hemorrhagic cystitis in a case-control study among HSCT recipients [274].",
