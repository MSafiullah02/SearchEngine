Each of the properties found was experimentally validated. Initially, we identify features of the overall model that are to be simultaneously satisfied. We then focus on the following two components: the spacer and the slippery sequence.

Most of these events are found in viruses and transposons, where they serve to produce the replicase domain needed for the life cycle. Enhancing or reducing the effectiveness of the mechanism can dramatically influence virus viability (Dinman et al., 1998) . Very few cellular genes using \u22121 frameshifting are presently known: the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) , the cdd gene of Bacillus subtilis (Mejlhede et al., 1999) and, more recently, the Edr gene in mice (Shigemoto et al., 2001) . To date, there is no general method to identify such genes. The genetic information carried by genes expressed through a frameshifting event is, by definition, out of frame. Therefore, these genes could be annotated as non-coding (Medigue et al., 1999) . The development of molecular approaches has permitted the demonstration that \u22121 frameshifting is correlated with the presence of specific signals on the coding sequence, which in turn has led to the design of an initial model.",

These signals are carried by the mRNA and superimposed on the coding sequence. Although the presence of the slippery site is sufficient to induce a low but biologically significant level of frameshifting, that of the stimulatory structure is not (Kollmus et al., 1996) . The short sequence between these two components is called the spacer and is denoted SP (Figure 1 ). For each subsequence of this model, the following features are of interest: (i) the length; (ii) the identity of the base at a given position; (iii) the number of occurrences of a given base; and (iv) the presence of a simple stem-loop or of a pseudoknot.",

Two attempts to model frameshifting sites were previously made. (Hammell et al., 1999) proposed a model whose main parameters are the structure of H, constraints of lengths, and numbers of pairings in the stems. Liphardt investigated the possibility of using stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG) to model the stimulatory structure (Liphardt, 1999) . Both approaches led to models which take into account the main known parameters of the phenomenon. However, the programs based on these models, when applied to entire genomes, found too many false positives. This may be due to two reasons. Firstly, the number of parameters to be considered in each site is large, and therefore difficult to handle 'by hand'. Secondly, the relatively small amount of data (known frameshift sites in wild viruses and mutants) is insufficient to lead to an accurate model of the phenomenon. Nonetheless, these studies constitute a significant step towards modelling frameshifting sites in order to design a prediction tool. In particular, they demonstrate that use of a stochastic model is rather promising, and that filtering constraints on the current model are necessary to increase the efficiency of any search program.",

As a unique rule is not sufficient to cover all the cases, we look for a disjunction of rules of this form (disjunctive learning). Under such rules, efficient frameshifting occurs if at least one of them is satisfied. If a given sequence satisfies the conditions of one rule, it is a good candidate for an actual frameshifting site.

The intuition underlying the GloBo algorithm is as follows: each example is used as a seed to gather the largest possible subset 'around' it without encompassing any counter-examples (thus yielding a correct subsets). Once all the subsets have been built (there are as many subsets as examples), a collection of a few subsets is selected such that all examples are covered. We keep only a minimal collection of such sets in order to obtain few rules, which allows for more intelligibility of the target concept. Each subset is associated to a rule. The algorithm is stochastic, which means many correct subsets are tested before the algorithm computes the actual result. In practice, it seems important to cover each known example with at least one rule, even at the expense of covering a few counter-examples (called false positives). Of course, the rules obtained will also be used as predictions (see Methodology, step 4) and only experimentation is able to establish the veracity of the prediction.",

As we saw above (see Results), the set of attributes used was not sufficient to distinguish all the examples from the counter-examples. This will lead us to introduce more attributes. Using a disjunctive learning tool such as GloBo led us to two rules which were then verified experimentally. The relevance of their attributes to the mechanism of frameshifting was tested by creating artificial frameshifting sites that follow the rules identified by our bioinformatics approach. The capacity of these sites to induce frameshifting was then assessed in vivo in yeast cells. As these two rules do not cover all the examples, other rules should be investigated.",

            "text": "Our results show that the spacer is involved in the efficiency of frameshifting. Although it has been known for many years that the length of the spacer region is crucial in frameshifting (Brierley, 1995) , it has been recently shown that the sequence could also be important in bacterial frameshifting sites (Bertrand et al., 2002) . The results presented here demonstrate that this sequence is also important in eukaryotic frameshifting. Different mechanisms could account for this effect: the nucleotides may directly interact with components of the translational machinery (i.e. ribosomal RNA or protein), or indirectly, by codon-anticodon interaction, or through the availability of the corresponding tRNA. In this case, the spacer could not be seen as a sum of individual nucleotides but as a unit. If this is so, the activity of a sequence may not be defined by a single nucleotide but by a suite of nucleotides, and there may be different suites that work well. In order to shed some light on this point, the spacer should be analyzed systematically using a combinatorial approach, similar to a SELEX experiment, that selects the most efficient spacer sequences. Such a procedure, adapted for translational regulation, is available and in use in our laboratory to analyze programmed readthrough (Namy et al., 2001) .",

This suggests that the core frameshifting signal could in fact be a tetranucleotide and that the XXX triplet is used to modulate the efficiency. It is well known that the bacterial frameshifting mechanism often involves only a tetramer sequence of the form Y YYZ. In eukaryotes also, although simultaneous tandem tRNA slippage is the main mechanism, single slippage has a place, with a low but significant frequency, at a given site (Jacks et al., 1988; Yelverton et al., 1994) .",

However, the few experiments that have been done up to now on different kinds of viruses have shown that hierarchies of heptamer efficiency are generally conserved from one virus to another (Farabaugh, 1996) . It would be of particular interest to complete the work of Brierley, by testing the remaining 20 heptamers in eukaryotic models and to test the frameshifting efficiency directed by the 64 possible heptamers and the 16 possible tetramers in a bacterial model. These 16 tetramer sequences should also be tested in eukaryotic cells, to assess whether some of them allow efficient frameshifting.",
