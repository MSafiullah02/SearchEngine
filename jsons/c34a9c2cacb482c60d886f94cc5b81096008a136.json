Subsequently it was found that haemagglutination was a characteristic of a wide range of vertebrate viruses, including the orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, togaviruses, rhabdoviruses, coronaviruses, bunyaviruses, picornaviruses, papovaviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses and reoviruses. Haemagglutinating viruses adsorb to the surface receptors on the surface of a variety of avian and vertebrate erythrocyte species (for details see Andrewes et al., 1978) . Chicken, guinea-pig and human erythrocytes appear to be more widely susceptible to agglutination than cells from other species. The haemagglutination (HA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests are now widely used as rapid quantitative assays for haemagglutinating viruses and their antibodies.",

Viral neuraminidases, a separate envelope glycoprotein, NA, of the influenza viruses but a component of the HN glycoprotein of parainfluenza viruses, elute virus from the erythrocyte surface by hydrolytic cleavage of the glycoside linkage joining neuraminic acid to galactose with the release of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Gottschalk, 1959; Scheid et al., 1972; Laver, 1973) . This phenomenon of adsorption and elution has been used extensively with influenza viruses as a preliminary step in purification (Ada and Perry, 1956; Hoyle et al., 1961; Laver, 1973) .",

In our preceding studies we had routinely purified [35S]methionine-1abelled virus by conventional procedures, involving differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation. These methods ultimately produced virus of adequate concentration and purity for PAGE, but were both costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a simple preparative procedure for the identification and comparison of the [3SS]methionine-labelled structural proteins of influenza and parainfluenza viruses. The technique involves the adsorption of clarified tissue culture medium with a 0.5% v/v suspension of chicken or guinea-pig erythrocytes, subsequent dissociation of the virus-red cell aggregates and analysis directly by",

HA, HA 1, HA2, RNP, NA and M that had previously been described for influenza viruses (Schulze, 1973; White, 1974; Choppin and Compans, 1975) were clearly resolved (Fig. 3) . No observable difference in the migrational properties or relative proportions of the virus structural proteins was observed when either chicken (Fig. 3a) or guinea-pig erythrocytes (Fig. 3b) were used for virus adsorption. Similar findings have been obtained for HPV in that the HA-PAGE procedure provides a simple concentration-purification step with resolution of structural proteins comparable to that obtained with sucrose gradient purified virus (Figs. 4and 5) . The human parainfluenza viruses have received scant attention in the past because they are usually associated with poor yield in tissue culture and extreme lability (Kingsbury, 1977; Goswami and Russell, 1982) , and thereby provide good models for testing the general applicability of the red-cell adsorption method. In otherstudies we have established (Cowley and Barry, 1983; unpubl. obs.) that all HPV comprise at least 6 major structural polypeptides which have been identified in Fig. 4 as L, P. HN, NP, F and M. All HPV polypeptides are not only resolved readily by the red-cell adsorption procedure, but within serotype 2 (Fig. 4 , lanes c-e) and serotype 3 (Fig. 4 , lanes f-i) the previously reported differences in the gel migration of the HN and NP polypeptides are apparent (Cowley and Barry, 1983 ). Since such differences may reflect genetic diversity within HPV serotypes, we believe that the red-cell adsorption method could be of general usefulness in probing the molecular epidemiology of HPV, and of a wide range of other haemaggluting viruses.",
