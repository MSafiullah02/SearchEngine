In fact, respiratory tract infections are generally more common in MS, and their incidence increases with age, level of disability, and male sex (Wijnands et al., 2017) . Influenzarelated hospitalizations and mortality are also significantly higher in patients with MS (Nelson et al., 2015) .

Several lines of investigation suggest that intense innate immune response and lack of enough adaptive immunity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, and the release of a large number of inflammatory cytokines may result in a poor prognosis (Cao, 2020) . For these reasons, a variety of immunomodulatory medications have been proposed as potential treatments for complications of COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials (Stebbing et al., 2020) .

Therefore, patients with MS treated with B-cell depleting agents might be more prone to COVID19. In fact, patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) who suffers from lack of Bcells showed full recovery following COVID-19 infection, implying that neutralizing antibody might be less crucial in the later phase of infection and its recovery (Quinti et al., 2020; Soresina et al., 2020) .
