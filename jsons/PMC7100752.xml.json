However, in 2011, the European intensive medicine society agreed on the Berlin definition, which is now widely applied and accepted in diagnosis of ARDS [1]. In the management of patients with ARDS, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been successfully used as salvage therapy. ARDS severe enough to require ECMO therapy is estimated to occur in nearly 5\u201310 cases per million population per year [2]. The effectiveness of ECMO in ARDS patients with pneumonia, influenza A (H1N1), and/or trauma has recently been described and considered promising [3, 4], although is still associated with higher mortality [5].",
