Signs associated with lesions in the infratentorial brain stem are discussed below. Signs associated with the diencephalic (thalamic and hypothalamic) lesions are similar to those associated with cerebral lesions and so are discussed in the cerebral lesion section.\u2022Cranial nerve dysfunction is a common sign of brain stem disease. The brain stem contains cranial nerve 3 through cranial nerve 12 (CN3\u2013CN12). Multiple or single cranial nerves may be involved in a disease process; signs are typically asymmetrical. CN5 through CN12 in the pons and medulla are more commonly affected than CN3 and CN4 in the midbrain.\n",

Disorders of swallowing (CN9 and CN10), laryngeal function (CN9 and CN10), and tongue mobility (CN12) can occur but are less common.\u2022Oculomotor weakness, strabismus, and resting pupillary changes occur with CN3, CN4, and CN6 involvement.\u2022Injury to ascending white matter tracts in the brain stem results in ipsilateral conscious proprioceptive deficits and other abnormalities in postural reactions. Occasionally, ataxia, dysmetria, and exaggerated postural reactions may be seen.\u2022Injury to descending upper motor neuron (UMN) nuclei and their tracts in the brain stem causes tetraparesis or paralysis characterized by increased extensor muscle tone and exaggerated reflexes. The weakness or paresis is usually more severe in limbs on the same side as the lesion.\u2022Severe brain stem lesions can result in disruption of the ascending reticular activating system. Clinical signs of progressively decreasing levels of consciousness (depression, obtundation, stupor, coma) correlate with the severity of the injury.\u2022Severe brain stem lesions can also affect cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Altered heart rate (bradycardia, supraventricular arrhythmias) and respiratory patterns (hyperventilation, ataxic respirations, apnea) are evident.\n",

They often appear to be well-circumscribed masses but invade the underlying neural parenchyma. They may have a cystic component. Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas arise mostly from deep intra-axial locations in the brain (usually cerebrum or diencephalon). Ependymomas are relatively uncommon and arise from cells lining any of the ventricular compartments. The lateral ventricles of the cerebrum are the most common sites for ependymoma formation. Choroid plexus papillomas and carcinomas develop in areas of the brain where choroid plexus is present. The most common sites for a choroid plexus papilloma are the fourth ventricle-lateral aperture area and the third ventricle. Obstruction of the third ventricle by a choroid plexus papilloma results in secondary hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension. Choroid plexus carcinomas, ependymomas, and, occasionally, oligodendrogliomas may metastasize to other central nervous system (CNS) areas using CSF pathways.",

Brain, cranial nerve, and spinal cord lesions can occur with concurrent leptomeningeal involvement. Multicentric malignant histiocytosis can secondarily invade the CNS in dogs (especially Bernese mountain dogs, rottweilers, golden retrievers). Forebrain, brain stem, spinal cord, and vertebral body invasion has been reported. Tumors that invade the brain by local extension include nasal adenocarcinoma, pituitary macroadenoma and carcinoma, and bony tumors of the skull including multilobular osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.

Both anterior uveitis and chorioretinitis are common with toxoplasmosis, rickettsial, and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) infections. Chorioretinitis and optic neuritis may also be observed with cryptococcal and distemper infections.\u2022Cytologic evaluation of skin lesions, nasal exudates, liver and splenic aspirates, lymph node and bone marrow aspirates, joint fluid, and CSF can sometimes identify the offending pathogen. Histopathologic evaluation of skin and muscle biopsies may also be useful to diagnose fungal and protozoal infections.\u2022CSF analysis in CNS infectious diseases frequently reveals a moderate to severe pleocytosis and elevated protein. Bacterial meningoencephalitis typically produces a neutrophilic pleocytosis with or without toxic changes in the neutrophils. Intracellular organisms are rarely observed. Blood, urine, and CSF cultures are indicated when bacterial infections are suspected even though CSF cultures are usually falsely negative. CSF characteristics of other CNS infections are described in Table 126-1, Table 126-2.\u2022CSF titers are preferred for diagnosis of distemper, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) ratio or intrathecal antibody coefficient for canine distemper virus (CDV) and toxoplasmosis can be determined using CSF and serum samples from affected animals. These methods correct for possible blood-CSF barrier breakdown by comparing CSF-to-serum ratios of pathogen-specific antibodies against ratios of vaccine-associated (usually adenovirus or calicivirus) antibodies. Non-paired serum titers for toxoplasmosis are unreliable in the dog and cat due to persistence of high antibody titers long after exposure. The antibody coefficient calculation may also be useful to diagnose CNS FIP, although false-negative cases of CNS FIP have been reported. Cryptococcal antigen-specific titers can be run on serum, but CSF titers provide a more definitive diagnosis of CNS involvement. Cryptococcal antibody titers may be falsely negative due to an inadequate humoral immunologic response to the encapsulated organism. Serum titers are useful for diagnosis of neosporosis and rickettsial diseases. Neospora caninum serum antibody titers are usually very high (>1:800) in infected dogs and do not crossreact with toxoplasmosis titers. Dogs exposed to the organism but without clinical signs of infection may also have high titers.\u2022MRI features of CNS infectious diseases include patchy edema and focal to multifocal contrast-enhancing lesions of the parenchyma. Some fungal and protozoal granulomas and bacterial abscesses can ring enhance. Edema can be severe with bacterial encephalitis. Meningeal enhancement is common, especially with bacterial meningoencephalitis. FIP is often characterized by periventricular and meningeal contrast enhancement and ventricular dilatation due to secondary hydrocephalus. Fungal granulomas and bacterial abscesses may resemble intracranial tumors due to their patterns of enhancement and perilesional edema.\u2022Occasionally, a brain biopsy may be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.\n",

The recommended treatment duration for CNS cryptococcal and coccidioidal infections with fluconazole is 9 to 12 months. In dogs, treatment of cryptococcal infections is stopped after two consecutive negative titers are obtained at least 4 weeks apart. Relapses are common if fluconazole therapy is stopped too early.\u2022Initial treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis is most effective if parenteral antibiotics are administered. Parenteral (usually intravenous) administration allows rapid therapeutic CNS and CSF drug concentrations to be achieved. Penicillin or ampicillin in combination with third-generation cephalosporins have a broad antimicrobial spectrum and are bactericidal (see Table 126-3\n). Many third-generation cephalosporins also cross the blood-CSF and blood-brain barrier in both the presence and the absence of inflammation. Concurrent low-dose dexamethasone therapy (0.15 mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours for 4 days) has been shown to be beneficial in human bacterial meningoencephalitis. After 3 to 5 days of parenteral therapy, inflammation resolves and the barrier to the entry of many antibiotics is restored. Extended therapy is then instituted with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics that penetrate non-inflamed meninges. These drugs include trimethoprim-sulfonamide, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones. Metronidazole is often added if an anaerobic component to the infection is suspected.\n",

The density of amyloid plaques shows a correlation with the severity of cognitive decline.\u2022Functional changes hypothesized to occur include decreased levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in frontal cortex, increased monoamine oxidase activity with increased norepinephrine and dopamine breakdown (with free radical formation), alterations in post-synaptic receptor numbers and function, and decreased mitochondrial energy production.\n",
