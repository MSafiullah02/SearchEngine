The precise underlying mechanism of this association is unclear, but infection-induced systemic inflammation with transient coagulation activation, and endothelial cell perturbation, may contribute to this [3, 4] . Endothelial cell perturbation and coagulation activation are associated with an increased risk of future ischemic heart disease [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several cross-sectional reports showed increased levels of hemostatic proteins during symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ; however, these findings are difficult to interpret, as the diagnosis was not unequivocally established. Whether viruses infecting the respiratory tract indeed perturb endothelial cells and thereby increase the risk of acute ischemic heart disease remains to be proven. Therefore, we determined the effect of naturally occurring acute respiratory tract infection on hemostatic proteins in a prospective study.",

Eligible subjects were at risk for influenza, as defined by the criteria to participate in the national influenza vaccination campaign. The Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all subjects provided informed consent. At the time of inclusion, a medical history, including influenza vaccination status, was obtained and a blood sample was collected; immediately thereafter, the follow-up period started. Blood samples and nose swabs were obtained when the predefined criteria of flu-like symptoms were met. We defined flu-like disease as the acute onset of fever (body temperature > 37.8\u00b0C) plus at least two of the following flu-like symptoms: headache, myalgia, sore throat, and cough. All specimens were obtained in the first 3 days of flu-like symptoms. In the convalescent phase, 14 days after the beginning of symptoms, the specimen collection was repeated. Blood was collected in empty vacuum tubes and in tubes containing 0.106 M trisodium citrate. All samples were taken in the morning and processed within 60 min: the tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 \u00b7 g, and plasma was pooled and then centrifuged again at 2000 \u00b7 g for 5 min. Subsequently, plasma was frozen and stored in aliquots of 0.5 mL at )80\u00b0C. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1+2 ) and plasmin-a 2 -antiplasmin (PAP) complexes were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Dade Behring (Marburg, Germany), plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) antigen was measured by an ELISA from Hyphen BioMed (Andre\u00b4sy, France), and von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen was measured by an ELISA from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Results for VWF are presented as percentages of normal pool plasma. The presence of antibodies against respiratory pathogens was established using ELISAs for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus type 1 and type 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and specific IgM and IgG against Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

We considered respiratory tract infection to be proven when there was a 4-fold elevation between the sample taken on the first day of flu-like symptoms and the sample taken in the convalescent phase 2 weeks later. In addition, samples were tested for RSV, influenza viruses type A and type B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) by routine diagnostic immunofluorescence assays 48 h after inoculation. Total RNA and DNA was isolated with the total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche Applied Science, Almere, the Netherlands), and amplification of HMPV, human coronavirus NL63 and influenza virus was performed as described previously [14] [15] [16] [17] . Amplification of RSV type A and type B, rhinovirus, coronavirus C43 and coronavirus 229E was performed using TaqMan EZ RT-PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands). Detection was performed on an ABI7700 detection system. All materials were spiked with an internal control, consisting of a fixed amount of phocine distemper virus to monitor for inhibition and/or loss of material. Data are presented as median \u00b1 interquartile range (IQR). Levels of hemostatic proteins between baseline and the acute phase of the disease, and between baseline and the convalescent phase, were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

PAI-1 levels did not change. In the convalescent phase, 2 weeks after the start of symptoms, VWF and PAP levels returned to baseline.

In subjects with proven viral infection, VWF antigen levels increased by 68% (IQR: 17-106) during the infection (P < 0.05). In the convalescent phase, 2 weeks after the start of symptoms, VWF levels returned to baseline. Median PAP levels increased by 136 lg L -1 (IQR: -18-287).
