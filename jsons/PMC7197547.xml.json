The highest concentrations were found in medical staff changing rooms, up to 40 copies m\u22123, and it was suggested this may have been due to resuspension of virus-laden particles from staff protective clothing while they were being removed. About a third of the samples from public areas, e.g. a shop close to the hospital site, were positive. Guo et al. [5] also measured surface and air concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in an ICU and isolation ward in Wuhan. They similarly found widespread surface contamination and measurable aerosol concentrations of the virus in both areas, although higher air concentrations in the ICU (average 1400 copies m\u22123 near to patients).",

The first two approaches are commonly used at the moment and rely on the wearer fitting the device as closely as possible to the face. There are two relevant standards in Europe: FFP2 (nominally should reduce exposure by at least 75%) and FFP3 (with a nominal 95% reduction in inhaled concentration). The better fit to the face is an important reason why FFP respirators provide a better level of protection than surgical masks. Our research with fine dust suggests that wearing a surgical mask might on average reduce aerosol concentrations by ~70% but FFP respirators should on average reduce concentrations inhaled by >95% [12,13]. However, this relies on the mask fitting and being worn correctly. PAPRs on the other hand should provide a more consistent fit and a higher degree of protection, i.e. >99.9% reduction in aerosol concentration inhaled [14]. Brosseau [15] argues that a precautionary approach would suggest healthcare workers exposed to infectious aerosols should be provided with and trained to use respirators with high protection factors, such as PAPRs; we concur.",
