Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 suspected patients was left to the clinician's discretion but most of the time, patients were tested when they were dyspneic or reported shortness of breath; had comorbidities that put them at risk of severe infection such as immunosuppression, chronic respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity; if they were over 70 years old; or if they were too weak to be discharged home. Some patients without clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but needing hospitalization in non-COVID areas were also tested. Patients under the age of 70, with no comorbidities, and with no respiratory symptoms were not tested. Prior to the outbreak, our department received approximately 110 to 120 patients per day and this number dropped to approximately 50 to 60 from the beginning of the pandemic in March. During the study period, we tested approximately 10 to 20 patients per day. If patients attended the ED more than once, only the last visit was included. There were no other exclusion criteria.",

However, despite the absence of clear predefined inclusion criteria, testing was performed in the vast majority of cases in patients who had severe symptoms such as dyspnea, reported shortness of breath, presented with comorbidities (e.g., immunosuppression or chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases), or were over 70 years old. Thus, our results may not be valid in other populations such as young people without comorbidities and those with very few symptoms. Also, as our results are issued from a single center in France, they may not be generalizable to other centers. Second, it is possible that patients did not systematically report their symptoms, and this might have lowered the estimates of their prevalence. Third, we may have underestimated anosmia because we only added this to the form on March 24, 2020. Fourth, lung ultrasound was not systematic and occurred in only 22.3% of the patients, which contributed to the large 95% CI observed. It is possible that emergency physicians performed lung US in the most severe cases and that the accuracy of this exam in predicting COVID-19 is likely to be lower in patients with fewer symptoms. Lastly, our gold-standard to diagnose COVID-19 was based on the RT-PCR which may have false-negatives. To address this, we also evaluated patients who were initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but were then hospitalized and secondarily tested positive and considered them as positives.",

Therefore, emergency physicians need to be cautious when they evaluate such patients and be aware of some pitfalls. Whereas fever (>37.3 \u00b0C) was reported in more than 90% of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [4, 6] , we found that, even if 78.2% of the patients reported fever, only 34.4% of the patients had \u2265 38 \u00b0C and 56.7% had \u2265 37.5 \u00b0C at ED triage. It is possible that the temperature was initially lowered by antipyretics and subsequently rose during the ED stay. Nevertheless, temperature should not be used in isolation to exclude COVID-19 [13] . Consistent with other studies, we found that the most frequent reported symptoms were fever, cough, dyspnea and myalgia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 23.6% of our patients, whereas one small study of 18 patients found a rate of 17% [14] , while larger cohorts have reported these symptoms in less than 10% [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Anosmia was reported by 13.8% of the patients in our cohort and was the most specific sign of COVID-19.

The AUC of 0.795 appeared to us quite fair for a new disease with very few specific clinical signs. Emergency physician gestalt has been studied in predicting other diseases and performed equally well with an observed AUC of 0.83 for appendicitis in children [30], 0.75 for acute coronary syndrome [31], 0.86 for acute heart failure syndrome [32] and 0.81 for pulmonary embolism [33]. In summary, in this large prospective cohort study of patients attending the ED with a suspicion of COVID-19, anosmia, emergency physician estimate of high clinical probability and bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound increased the likelihood of identifying COVID-19 in patients presenting to the ED. Future studies should assess this in other emergency departments and the role of combining findings to develop clinical decision tools.
