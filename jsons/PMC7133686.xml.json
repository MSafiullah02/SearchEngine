The emergence of the pandemic influenza in 2009, the increasing numbers of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in China, the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), continued outbreaks of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) viruses in several countries, and novel strains of influenza now infecting humans, highlights the importance of international collaboration on respiratory virus research and development of new strategies for their prevention and control. The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses Diseases (isirv) is an independent and international scientific professional society promoting the prevention, detection, treatment, and control of influenza and other respiratory virus diseases. The Antiviral Group is a special interest group of isirv (isirv-AVG) with specific objectives to promote understanding of the clinical use of antivirals against respiratory viruses, and to collate and provide up to date information on the emergence of antiviral resistance to the established therapeutics. It also aims to provide information on the evaluation of resistance to new therapies under development. To communicate advances in preclinical and clinical development of potent novel antivirals four previous conferences have been organized by the isirv-AVG.",

            "text": "Around 70% of emerging human infectious diseases have arisen from animal reservoirs. Several viruses with global pandemic potential include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, vector-borne viruses (Zika virus, but also Dengue and Chikungunya viruses), and Ebola virus. For influenza viruses, an increased number of human infections with avian A(H7N9) viruses, and appearance of a sub-lineage that has acquired features of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) are recent notable events (Ke et al., 2017, Su et al., 2017). Live poultry markets (LPM) remain the mostly likely source of A(H7N9) infection, with 67% of patients exposed to an LPM, versus 33% with no history of exposure. HPAI A(H5N6) (Zhou et al., 2016) and A(H5N1) viruses continue to pose zoonotic threats. Influenza A(H5N8) viruses, though currently not causing zoonotic disease, continue to disseminate via wild bird migration. Responses to control of emerging influenza infections include: 1) early detection; 2) control at source (i.e. interruption of virus transmission chain at retail and wholesale LPM); and 3) innovation in predicting emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. New high-throughput technologies and improved diagnostic capacity are essential for better control. LPM remain hubs for virus amplification, persistence and dissemination within poultry as well a source of transmission to humans. A high level of contamination of chicken carcasses with infectious avian influenza viruses (39.8% of 1230 samples) was also detected either at the retail LPM or at the dressed poultry stalls (Mao et al., 2017). Viral RNA or infectious avian influenza viruses of H5, H7 and H9 subtypes were detected in air samples from LPM in Guangzhou and Hong Kong SAR, and the use of de-feathering devices increased the quantity of virus-laden airborne particles (Zhou et al., 2016). Thus, both direct contact with live poultry, and airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses can increase zoonotic risks. Interventions to reduce risk of novel virus emergence in LPM, such as market rest-days (or even closure), ban of live poultry stalls in urban areas with central slaughtering and sales of poultry carcasses, have been implemented in China (Peiris et al., 2016, Yuan et al., 2015).",

Influenza viruses of swine in China now carry multiple internal gene segments derived from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Baudon et al., 2017). Most of these are H1 or H3 subtype viruses to which there is human population cross-immunity, but the possibility that swine viruses with the A(H1N1)pdm09 internal gene cassette may acquire avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) genes through genetic reassortment is a concern. Although it is difficult to accurately predict the pandemic threat of a virus, systematic algorithms addressing the risk that an avian or animal virus will achieve sustained human-to-human transmission and emerge as a pandemic (IRAT, TIPRA) have been developed (Trock et al., 2015). Such risk-assessments will need to be made on a continuing basis for pre-pandemic vaccine strain selection.",

It is estimated that more than 45,000 people in Saudi Arabia are seropositive, however as mild cases do not seem to induce high levels of neutralizing antibody, many more may have been infected. In contrast, although many dromedary camels in Africa are both virus and seropositive, the disease is not seen. Reasons for this epidemiological pattern may include viral genetic heterogeneity, cultural differences in interactions with camels or lack of diagnosis of human MERS-CoV. The continuous surveillance of MERS-CoV in animal reservoirs, rapid identification and characterization of novel pathogens and their host interactions is required as it will decrease the potential virus threat to human health.",

Interestingly, GS-5734 is also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function.

Subsequently, the virus spread within the hospitals in Seoul, resulting in 186 cases of confirmed infection, including 38 fatalities (Kang et al., 2017). Age >55 years old was the greatest risk factor. During the epidemic lasting 2 months, 16,993 individuals were quarantined for two weeks with an estimated economic cost of 8.3 billion USD. A total of 17 patients were categorized into severe and mild groups, depending on whether oxygen supplementation was used during the hospital stay. Viral load in these patients analyzed by rRT-PCR found that MERS-CoV concentrations peaked during the 2nd week of illness. The severe group had higher viral loads than those in the mild group. The patients in the severe group also had more prolonged viral shedding in respiratory secretions than those in the mild group. Importantly, lower respiratory tract specimens had higher and more prolonged levels of MERS-CoV RNA than those from upper respiratory tract. 10% of patients were still PCR positive at day 28. Throat swabs may be an alternative source of diagnostic samples when sputum cannot be obtained (Oh et al., 2016). After sequencing full viral genomes of strains isolated from 4 patients early and late during infection, who represented at least 4 generations of transmission, it was found that there was no evidence of changes in the evolutionary rate and no adaptive changes in viral proteins (Seong et al., 2016).",

They could be categorized into three spreader groups, including 5 super-spreaders, 10 usual-spreaders, and the non-spreaders group (n = 171). The significant risk factors in the spreader group include: 1) high temperature (\u226538.5 \u00b0C), 2) pulmonary infiltration (\u22653 lung zones), and more non-isolated in-hospital days. The super-spreaders had more non-isolated in-hospital days than the usual-spreaders (Mean, 6.6 vs. 2.9 days), suggesting that early active quarantine might help reduce the size of an outbreak (Kang et al., 2017).",

Previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunits of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein plays an important role in mediating virus binding to its receptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and contains the critical neutralizing domain, thus serving as an important target for developing a SARS-CoV vaccine (Du et al., 2009, He et al., 2005). Similarly, the RBD in MERS-CoV S protein can also effectively bind to its receptor, DPP4, and induce potent neutralizing antibody responses in the RBD-immunized mice (Du et al., 2013b). A subunit vaccine was engineered by linking MERS-CoV S-RBD with the Fc of human IgG (RBD-Fc) (Du et al., 2013a). The transgenic mice that globally expressed human DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg) immunized with RBD-Fc were fully protected from lethal MERS-CoV challenge (Tao et al., 2015). This RBD-Fc subunit vaccine was further optimized using immune refocusing and \u201cneutralizing immunogenicity index\u201d (NII) strategies (Du et al., 2016) suggesting that this vaccine candidate has potential to be further developed as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for prevention of MERS-CoV infection.",

These mAbs bound MERS-CoV S-RBD with high affinity and avidity. They bound to epitopes that overlap the receptor binding site on the RBD. The highest-affinity mAb, m336, is exceptionally potent in neutralizing both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV with 50% neutralization at pM level (Ying et al., 2014). The hDPP4-Tg mice treated with m336 prior to or post lethal MERS-CoV challenge were fully protected (Agrawal et al., 2016). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the structure of Fab m336 in complex with MERS-CoV S-RBD reveals that its epitope almost completely overlaps with the RBD.

Most recently, the reported number of EV-D68 cases in acute respiratory infections (ARI) significantly increased (Biggs et al., 2017). To explore possible reasons for the recent increase, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 in children (<5-year-old) were analyzed. A hospital-based study on children with clinical diagnosis of severe pneumonia based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) criteria was performed in several sites in the Philippines from 2008 to 2015.

Case fatality rate was 8.5% in the hospitalized EV-D68 positive cases, whereas that in EV-D68 the hospitalized negative cases was 3.6% (P = 0.06). Phylogenetic analysis, showed these Philippine strains belonged to lineage 2 (L2) and 3 (L3). About 57.6%, 20.3%, and 22.0% of the hospitalized EV-D68 positive cases were L2, L3 and undetermined, respectivelty. There is no significant difference in the case fatality rate between L2 (5.9%) and L3 (16.7%)(P = 0.2), and the proportions of very severe pneumonia (61.3% vs 50%, P = 0.3). Similarly, about 78.3%, 16.7%, and 5.0% of the EV-D68 positive cohort cases were L2, L3 and undetermined, respectivelty. Interestingly, the proportion of cases diagnosed as pneumonia/severe pneumonia/very severe pneumonia in L2 (57%) was significantly higher than that in L3 (20%) (P = 0.048). The results from this study suggest that though the positive rates of EV-D68 are low in both hospitalized children with pneumonia and cohort children cases with ARI in the Philippines, EV-D68 is associated with more severe pneumonia. The Philippine strains of EV-D68 belonged to L2 and L3, while L2 is the dominant genogroup and is associated with more severe disease in cohort children, confirming that EV-D68 is an important pathogen for ARI and its L2 and L3 possess different epidemiological and clinical characteristics.",

The first widespread community cluster of the H275Y mutant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was identified in Newcastle, Australia in 2011 (Hurt et al., 2012). During the 2013\u20132014 influenza season in Japan, a large community cluster of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus exhibited cross-resistance to the NAIs, oseltamivir and peramivir (Takashita et al., 2014, Takashita et al., 2015). In the 2015\u20132016 influenza season, surveillance of NAI-resistant viruses throughout Japan was conducted. A fluorescent NA inhibition assay was used to determine the susceptibilities of viruses to oseltamivir, peramivir, and other NAIs, zanamivir and laninamivir, according to the WHO criteria, which are based on the fold change of IC50 values compared to the median IC50 values of the same subtype/lineage (WHO, 2012).",

These results suggest that the dual H275Y/G147R and H275Y/I223K substitutions exhibited synergistic effects compared with those for the single H275Y change.

Over a 7-year period, 2213 oseltamivir-treated, IAV-infected patients with follow-up were analyzed for treatment-associated emergentce of resistance. Quantitative IAV RT-PCR was performed on nasal and throat swabs taken at day 1 (for baseline) and on days 3, 6 and 10, respectively. For genotyping and phenotyping of the virus, mutation specific RT-PCR (275Y, 119V, 292K) and next generation sequencing on original swabs were performed. Sanger sequencing and NA inhibition analysis were conducted by NA-STAR assay on cultured material. Resistance mutations were detected in 57 (2.6%) of oseltamivir-treated patients, including 39 infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 with the H275Y substitution and 18 infected by A(H3N2) strains with the R292K substitution. The resistance mutations were first detected on day 3, 6 and 10 in 27%, 68% and 5% of the oseltamivir-treated patients, respectively. At the next visit, the resistant mutant was cleared in 73% of these patients. The resistant viruses isolated from 27 patients were less than 10% of the virus population, as detected by mutation-specific RT-PCR, but they were not detected by the NA-STAR assay. However, for 74% of the patients in whom resistant mutant strains were the majority species, an oseltamivir resistant phenotype was confirmed by the NA-STAR assay. For A(H1N1)pdm09 strains, median viral RNA clearance was 11.9 and 8.9 days for resistant and wild-type cases, respectively (P < 0.0001), while there is no signficant difference in clearance of A(H3N2) strains. In summary, oseltamivir-resistant mutants of IAVs were detected in 2.6% of oseltamivir-treated patients. Although these mutations are not associated with other major substitutions in HA and NA proteins that potentially aid viral fitness, they are associated with delayed clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09, but not with that of A(H3N2) virus.",

Systematic reviews will be commissioned to inform the guideline. The GDG will formulate recommendations based on the evidence quality as assessed using the GRADE approach, while the GSC will ensure that the guideline must meet the breadth of the WHO public health agenda, including subpopulations vulnerable to severe diseases.

An earlier start and a steep increase in the number of human cases of A(H7N9) virus infection was observed during the fifth epidemic in China in 2016\u20132017 (Zhou et al., 2017a). Most human cases occurred in Eastern and Southern China in the earlier epidemics. However, six provinces in Central and Western China without previous cases, reported human infections in the fifth epidemic, indicating geographic expansion of A(H7N9) cases. In comparison with the earlier epidemics, the epidemiology characteristics such as sex and age of patients infected with A(H7N9) virus remained unchanged, but the proportion of rural residents among confirmed cases increased in the fifth wave. Severity remained high in the fifth epidemic: 90% of cases were diagnosed as severe, and 79% of cases were admitted into an intensive care unit. Most (90%) cases reported exposures to poultry, including 75% that had visited an LPM before illness onset or had contact with poultry purchased from an LPM. Since 2013, 37 clusters (comprising 78 cases), of at least 2 epidemiologically-linked confirmed cases have been identified, including 11 clusters reported in the fifth epidemic. There were no changes in the size or number of clusters per epidemic and there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. While most human cases confirmed since 2013 were caused by low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N9) virus infection, 25 cases of HPAI A(H7N9) virus infection have been identified in three provinces in southern China during the fifth epidemic. Preliminary analysis indicated that HPAI A(H7N9) virus-infected patients were more likely to live in rural areas, have exposure to sick or dead poultry, and admitted to hospitals earlier than LPAI A(H7N9) cases. Extensive efforts are needed to prevent and control the spread of LPAI and HPAI A(H7N9) viruses among poultry, including in rural areas (Zhou et al., 2017b).",

In late 2016 and beginning of 2017, three patients with severe clinical symptoms were confirmed to be infected with HPAI A(H7N9) viruses. The viruses belonged to the Yangtze River Delta lineage. Four amino acids inserted (Lys-Arg-Thr-Ala) at the HA cleavage site enabled the A(H7N9) HPAI virus to display trypsin-independent infectivity (Zhu et al., 2017). Additionally, the HPAI viruses have acquired the L226Q substitution in the HA, although maintaining dual receptor-binding preference. The HPAI HA antigenicity is distinct from the LPAI A(H7N9) viruses. All viruses have the S31N substitution in their M2 protein, conferring amantadine resistance. Among 314 LPAI viruses tested for NAI susceptibility, 18/314 had decreased sensitivity, one with I222R, two with A246T and 15 with the R292K substitutions, the latter conferring a multidrug resistance phenotype. Among HPAI viruses tested, 4/21 also had reduced sensitivity, with three of those with the R292K substitution (Ke et al., 2017). All 292K isolates arose post-treatment. Therefore, surveillance of the virus, especially antiviral surveillance, is an essential component of pandemic preparedness.",

In a study of 14 patients with A(H7N9) infection complicated by pneumonia, NAI treatment was associated with a reduction of viral load in throat swab specimens in 11 surviving patients. However, 3 patients with persistently high viral loads in the throat, despite antiviral therapy, became dependent on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. An R292K NA substitution was identified in two of these patients, who had also received systemic corticosteroid treatment. In one of them, wild-type sequence R292 was noted 2 days after commencement of NAI treatment, and the resistant mutant K292 dominated 9 days after commencement of treatment (Hu et al., 2013). Using limited serial passage in the presence of oseltamivir, and plaque purification, an R292K variant of the Anhui1 lineage was isolated from a patient with clinical evidence of resistance to oseltamivir. In vitro and cell-based assays confirmed a high level of resistance of A(H7N9) virus carrying the R292K substitution to oseltamivir carboxylate and a moderate level of resistance to zanamivir and peramivir. Non-NAI antivirals, such as T-705, ribavirin and NT-300, efficiently inhibited both the variant and the wild-type viruses in cell-based assays. A combination of NAIs and non-NAIs did not exhibit a marked synergistic effect against the R292K variant in cell culture. However, the combination of two non-NAIs (T-705 and ribavirin) exhibited synergism against the mutant virus. In experimentally infected mice, the R292K variant showed delayed onset of symptoms, a reduced viral load and attenuated lethality compared with the wild-type. The study suggested non-NAIs should be tested clinically for A(H7N9) patients with a sustained high viral load. Possible drug combination regimens, such as T-705 plus ribavirin, should be further tested in animal models. A real-time RT-PCR and single nucleotide polymorphism probes have been developed to differentiate this mutant strain in mixed virus populations in human specimens (Wang et al., 2014b). Screening of 18 patients undergoing oseltamivir therapy identified viruses with mixed R/K sequence, not previously detected.",

For a clinical microbiology laboratory handling low to medium specimen volumes, these platforms are preferred as they allow a simple workflow that can be used with minimal training, and afford a rapid turnaround time. However, these platforms are not capable of large volumes of testing. Batched testing high throughput platforms are useful for unexpected increases in testing volume such as nosocomial outbreaks, peak influenza seasons, and during pandemics.

Current severity assessment tools have not been tested in this population. The goal of this study was to develop a new clinical severity tool, and compare to currently available tools such as PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) (Fine et al., 1995), SMARTCOP (Charles et al., 2008) (systolic blood pressure, multilobar chest radiography involvement, albumin level, respiratory rate, tachycardia, confusion, oxygenation, and arterial pH), and CURB-65 (Lim et al., 2003) (confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years of age and older). Data was collected from patients who were hospitalized with influenza A(H7N9) infection in China. A derivation cohort was constructed from the clinical data of 613 patients hospitalized between April 2013 and March 2015. Of these, 285 patients had complete data. The 30-day mortality of the derivation cohort was 26.3%. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify clinical features at admission to hospital that were associated with mortality within 30 days. These results were converted into a simple point-based severity tool which was based on creatinine level, lymphocyte count, PaO2/FiO2, and age. The 30-day mortality of the validation cohort was 47.4%. Risk factors associated with 30-day mortality were creatinine >133 \u03bcmol/L (1 point), lymphocyte count < 0.3 \u00d7 109/L (1 point), age > 60 (1 point) or 80 years (2 points), and PaO2/FiO2 < 100 (2 points) or 200 mmHg (1 point). The scoring system is called CLAP. After derivation of the scoring system, a validation cohort was compiled with clinical data from 171 patients hospitalized between October 2016 and March 2017. Sensitivities and specificity of CLAP on admission identifying the 30-day mortality were 90.79% and 45.45%, respectively. The highest AUROCs were for the CLAP score (0.77; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.82) and the PSI score (0.73; 95% CI, 0.68\u20130.78) compared with 0.62 (95% CI, 0.56\u20130.68) for SMART-COP (P < 0.001, compared with CLAP) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55\u20130.65) for CURB-65 (P < 0.001, compared with CLAP). CLAP is a simple scoring tool that my have utility in predicting the outcome of patients infected with influenza A(H7N9) viral pneumonia.",

This analysis examined if the adaptive immune response, as measured by hemagglutinin-inhibition assay (HAI), was different among treatment groups. Approximately 80% of the enrolled patients were infected with influenza A(H3N2) virus, and 20% with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Antibody levels were evaluated at three timepoints: baseline, day 3\u20134, and day 14 \u00b1 3.

The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the pilot phase, 172 without influenza confirmed in the central laboratory, and 13 without an endpoint sample. 80 of 200 (40.0%) participants in the combination arm had virus detectable at day 3 compared to 97 of 194 (50.0%) (95% C.I. 0.2\u201319.8%, P = 0.046) in the control arm.",

These factors, in part, contribute towards its substantial influenza mortality burden, estimated at 11\u201318 excess deaths per 100,000 in the southern and northern cities in the inter-pandemic seasons (Feng et al., 2012). Although seasonal influenza vaccination was introduced in China in 1998, it is not included in the national immunization program. The influenza vaccine coverage is still relative low: 2009/2010\u20138.5%, 2010/2011\u20139.5%, 2011/2012\u20134.3%, mainly in the elderly in wealthier cities. Additionally, substantial vaccination rate diversity is observed among low- and high-income cities and provinces. On the basis of multiyear laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data representative of a large majority of the Chinese population (2005\u20132011), three epidemiological regions were identified for influenza A virus infection: northern provinces (latitude \u2265 33\u00b0N) experience winter epidemics, southern provinces (latitude < 27\u00b0N) experience peak activity in spring, while provinces at intermediate latitudes experience semi-annual epidemic cycles (Yu et al., 2013). Therefore, it is optimal for Northern China to follow the timing of vaccination typically recommended for the Northern Hemisphere, with annual campaigns starting in October. In contrast, most of southern Chinese provinces have to accommodate influenza activity peaking in April\u2013June, and hence vaccination would be best initiated in February\u2013March of each year, broadly coinciding with the recommended timing of vaccination for the Southern Hemisphere.",

Before the 2009 influenza pandemic, only southern Chinese provinces and three northern provinces (including Gansu, Liaoning and Tianjin) conducted full-year influenza surveillance, although other northern provinces conducted half-year surveillance. Now this network includes 411 provincial- and prefecture-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and 556 sentinel hospitals situated in 31 provinces. Currently, all provinces are doing year-round influenza surveillance. Sentinel hospitals report the numbers of total outpatient visits and the numbers of visits by outpatients with ILI and age group. A retrospective telephone survey estimated the cost of treatment for out-patients for influenza was $155 USD and >$1500 for in-patients (Yang et al., 2015). The national sentinel hospital-based influenza surveillance network and surveillance for SARI in central China showed that outpatients, hospitalization, mortality and economic burdens associated with influenza are substantial in China. Significant variations were observed in influenza-associated ILI burden and SARI hospitalizations by provinces, age, and influenza virus type. In one survey of approximately 80 million patients presenting at sentinel hospitals 3.1% had ILI and of those tested for influenza, 12.3% were positive. Surveillance among 4 hospitals in Jingzhou from 2010-2012 showed that of 16,208 SARI cases tested, 2057 (13%) had confirmed influenza, including 1427 (69%) aged <5 years (Yu et al., 2014a). Marked differences in seasonality of influenza A and B viruses were determined, with most of China experiencing annual influenza B activity in winter. Active surveillance for hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory infections revealed the spectrum of viral agents in 24 provinces of China during 2009\u20132013: influenza in 1869 patients (6.6%), RSV in 2795 patients (9.9%), PIV in 1366 patients (4.8%), adenovirus in 957 patients (3.4%), bocavirus in 551 patients (1.9%), human metapneumovirus in 424 patients (1.5%) and hCoV in 393 patients (1.4%) (Feng et al., 2014).",

This version is based on new evidence that has emerged in the recent decade on the etiological profile of CAP in China, advances in laboratory diagnosis, newer anti-infective therapies, and accessibility to effective vaccines (Torres et al., 2016). The main contents of the Guideline include: definition and diagnosis of CAP, assessment of CAP severity, criteria for hospital admission, etiological diagnosis, anti-infective therapies, adjunctive therapies, assessment after initial therapy and the criteria for discharge, unusual types of CAP, and prophylaxis. The recommendations were graded based on the strength of the evidence according to international standards. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia are the commonest bacterial pathogens, which have distinctive resistance patterns (penicillins, macrolides); gram-negative pathogens (e.g. Klebsiella pneumonia, E. coli) are more frequently found in the special populations such as the elderly; respiratory viruses constitute 15\u201335% of cases, with influenza being the most important pathogen. Community-acquired MRSA infections remain rare. The CURB-65 score is recommended as a tool to assist decision on hospitalization of Chinese patients. The use of culture-based, antigen-based and molecular assays, as well as biochemical markers (e.g. procalcitonin) for diagnosis is discussed; empirical antibacterials and antivirals are recommended based on the epidemiological data, clinical scenario and resistance profiles. NAIs are recommended for influenza pneumonia. Influenza vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines (polysaccharide, conjugated) are recommended for prevention. An English version of this practice guideline is under preparation.",

Altogether, 211 HCWs and 1028 working adults reported 4066 and 15932 contacts respectively. HCWs reported more work-related contacts (median of 13 vs 4), and less household contacts (2 vs 3). HCWs also had more work-related skin-to-skin contacts (6 vs 1). Among different HCW subgroups, doctors reported the highest while ward-based nurses reported the lowest total work-related contacts (17 vs 11). However, skin-to skin work-related contacts were highest for ward-based nurses compared with other HCWs (7 vs 5).

A total of 6167 cases were enrolled; of these, 206 (3.3%) tested positive for hMPV by a multiplex PCR assay.

However, understanding of the dynamics driving the on-going evolution and epidemiology of RSV transmission in humans is rather limited. To study genetic diversity, as well as potential baseline resistance to novel therapeutics, the genomes of RSV strains collected from adult and pediatric patients in Australia from 2010\u22122016 (RSV-A, n = 70; RSV-B, n = 80) were amplified and sequenced using a 4x4 Kb overlapping RT-PCR strategy that targeted both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes. Nextera XT libraries were prepared and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. Following de novo assembly, RSV sequences were aligned with global references and analyzed using a phylodynamic approach. A distinct seasonality was observed with most infections occurring during the late winter period (with subtle shifts in the seasonal relative predominance of RSV-A and RSV-B strains). Multiple co-circulating lineages were identified with the Australian strains dispersed throughout the global diversity. Spatial and temporal clustering was observed at local and regional scales highlighting the complex fine-scale dynamics (e.g. institutional outbreaks), as well as gene flow within the Asia-Oceania region. This gene flow with local endemic lineages was consistent with other respiratory pathogens suggesting viral traffic is driven by human movement and interactions. A strong-temporal structure was also observed with similar mean rates of evolutionary change at global scales for both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes at 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year) and 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 subs/site/year, respectively. Like previous observations, most variation was found in the G protein and intergenic regions. However, fixed changes were observed within the fusion protein at potentially antigenic sites of recent RSV-A strains. Resistance associated mutations at the F protein and the polymerase genes seemed rare. Their data add to the understanding of RSV genetic diversity, transmission, and disease dynamics which may benefit future vaccine design.",

Therefore, it is important to distinguish these mechanisms to refine and direct specific antiviral, antibacterial, and (potentially) immunomodulatory therapy.

(Cole et al., 2017). Interferon-related antiviral pathways genes were overexpressed during the early phase of illness (0\u20135 days), followed by activation of the inflammatory cell pathways including neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells (days 5\u201310). The molecular scores were related to severity and were affected by bacterial sepsis, but depended most critically on timing since onset of symptoms. Identification of specific patterns of immune activation that might be amenable to therapeutic manipulation may ultimately assist in management of influenza, but require careful interpretation.",

Samples were taken during the acute phase (7 \u00b1 3 days) and recovery phase (21 \u00b1 3 days) and were tested against live A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and peptide pools of influenza viruses. The longitudinal changes in influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses with or without pneumonia were characterized and T cell activation and migration-related cytokines/chemokines in plasma were measured. Compared with milder infections, influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and virus shedding were elevated in patients with pneumonia. During the acute phase of illness, effector CD8+ T cells (CD45RA+CCR7-) with highly-expressed inhibitory immune receptor CD200R dominated the response (IFN-\u03b3 secreting). In the recovery phase, effector memory CD4+ T (CD45RA-CCR7-) cells with highly-expressed PD1, CTLA4 and LAG3 were higher in those with severe infections compared to mild infections. The magnitude of T cell responses correlated with pneumonia severity (as indicated by PaO2/FiO2, lung injury score, APACHE II score). In addition, T cell activation and migration-related cytokines/chemokines were associated with disease severity. Thus CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses may play a role in pathogenesis and disease progression in A(H1N1)pdm09 pneumonia.",

The role of AIM2 was studied using knock-out mice infected with lethal doses of IAV A/PR8/34 and A/California/07/09. In AIM2-deficient mice, induced dsDNA release, caspase-1 activation and release of cleaved IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs were significantly reduced. In addition, AIM2 deficient mice exhibited attenuated lung injury (with fewer neutrophil infiltration) and improved survival against IAV challenge; virus burden in the lung was unaltered. Deficiency of AIM2 was not shown to affect the adaptive immune response against IAV infections. In vitro experiments with siAIM2 treated and AIM2 deficient human and mouse lung alveolar macrophages and type II cells indicated a macrophage-specific function of AIM2 in the regulation of IAV-stimulated proinflammatory responses (Zhang et al., 2017). These findings suggest that influenza infection activates the AIM2 inflammasome, which may play an important role in IAV-induced lung injury and mortality.",

Depletion of DDX19B by siRNA resulted in up to a 2 log10 decrease in virus yields in single- and multi-cycle replication kinetics. The growth defect was also found in other influenza subtypes, including A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, H7N4, and type B. The effect was early since by 4 hours after infection (pi) levels of mRNA and vRNA were reduced. Normally the RNPs are imported into the nucleus by 3\u20134 hours pi, but there was little NP staining in the nucleus. Furthermore, there was no M1 staining in the cytoplasm, indicating that while DDX19B is known to function in mRNA nuclear export, the block was earlier at the uncoating step. This contrasts with others who showed the DDX19B enhanced the nuclear export of influenza mRNA (Diot et al., 2016).",

In ferrets infected with WT virus, and treated with oseltamivir, resistant viruses with the R292K change emerged in 4/6 virus-infected ferrets on day 5 of treatment. The laboratory has tested the BD iART assay, designed for detection of resistant viruses in clinical samples (Gubareva et al., 2017). Pure populations with >50-fold resistance were readily detected. However, with mixed populations, as the R292K NA has lower activity, it needed >80% of the R292K population to be detected. However, modifying the buffer to a lower pH, enabled detection of 20% mutant. One R292K virus also had an HA mutation, D19G in the HA2. This virus appeared to have reduced sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to the Genentech Human mAb, 81.39a (Marjuki et al., 2016).

They may be composed of extracts from a single or multiple plant species or other materials, in various formulations. They may have antiviral activity or inhibit virus replication by modulating the immune response (Ma et al., 2015). Some of the following are reported to have some antiviral effects in preclinical studies.a)Paeonia delavayi root extracts significantly inhibited NA activity, with two of seven identified constituents significantly inhibiting the NA (Li et al., 2016b). No cell or animal testing has been done.b)Lianhuaqingwen Capsule inhibited the proliferation of various strains of influenza viruses in plaque reduction assays, and impaired the nuclear export of the viral RNP (Ding et al., 2017). It also suppressed virus-induced NF-kB activation and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines.c)Laggera pterodonta Benth extract was fractionated, and one component acted on the early stage of influenza virus replication and prevented the increased expression of cytokines and chemokines (Wang et al., 2017).d)Puerana lobata Ohwi P. lobata showed antiviral activity against HRSV-induced plaque formation in HEp-2 and A549 cells. It acts at an early stage of infection, inhibiting viral attachment and internalization (Lin et al., 2013).d)Scutellaria baicalensis root extracts were fractionated, and baicalin was found to be responsible for antiviral activity against RSV in a plaque assay. In a mouse model baicalin treatment resulted in reduction of T lymphocyte infiltration and gene expression of proinflammatory factors, while the treatment moderately reduced RSV titers recovered from the lung tissues (Shi et al., 2016).e)Andrographolide is an essential active ingredient extracted from the plant Andrographis paniculata. However, its poor water solubility limits its bioavailability. Oral administration of an Andrographolide derivative reduced the death rate, inhibited lung consolidation, and reduced viral titers in the lung in A(H1N1), A(H9N2), and A(H5N1) infected mice (Chen et al., 2009). Other derivatives are reported to inhibit replication of an A(H3N2) virus in cells (Yuan et al., 2016).\n",

It occupies the 7-methyl GTP (m7 GTP) cap-binding site of PB2, selectively inhibiting the production of mRNA (Byrn et al., 2015). In a lethal mouse model of A(H5N1) infection, treatment with 10 mg/kg twice daily protected 100% of mice even when treatment was delayed up to 4 days (Byrn et al., 2015). Some protection was still seen after delaying treatment until 5 days post-infection. In a human challenge model 46% of drug is orally available, with 90% of the available metabolite unchanged. Half life is around 24 hours, with more than 75% fecal elimination. It is metabolized by CYP3A4, but has no effect on cytochrome P450 levels. In trials evaluating safety and dosing efficacy, among 200 patients administered a single dose up to 3200 mg, and 446 patients given multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for 10 days, the most common adverse event was defined as \u201cloose stools\u201d. In a Phase IIb trial patients were given 600 mg twice daily for 7 days, with or without 75 mg of oseltamivir. Preliminary results show there was a significant decrease in nasal viral load AUC by qRT-PCR in the pimodivir treated group. Pimodivir plus 75 mg of oseltamivir showed a greater decrease in AUC than 600 mg of pimodivir alone. Ten percent of samples had resistant viruses, previously shown to occur by mutations in the PB2 (Byrn et al., 2015). No drug-drug interactions with oseltamivir, Pitavastatin, or oral contraceptives were seen, nor any cardiac safety concerns. A Phase III trial is planned for winter 2017\u20132018.",

It blocks the HA-mediated membrane fusion in the endosome, promoting ADCC of the infected cell, and also leads to direct virus binding, inhibiting the release of the virus genome. It remains bound even at pH 5.0 preventing unfolding of the fusion peptide. It neutralizes all known human influenza A strains (Gupta et al., 2016). In a lethal mouse model there is dose dependent protection up to 72 hours post-infection, with 300 \u03bcg providing >90% protection. It is being developed to treat patients hospitalized with influenza. In Phase I trials it demonstrated linear serum pharmacokinetics consistent with those of a human IgG1 antibody (Lim et al., 2016). In a Phase IIa study 60 subjects in three single-dose groups (400, 1200, or 3600 mg) received MHAA4549A intravenously 24\u201336 hours after inoculation with influenza A virus (Deng et al., 2017, McBride et al., 2017). All subjects started a 5-day course of oseltamivir (twice daily) from day 7. MHAA4549A exhibited dose-proportional serum PKs, but not dose-proportional nasal PKs. No PK drug\u2013drug interaction between MHAA4549A and oseltamivir was observed (Deng et al., 2017). Only the 3600 treated group showed significantly reduced virus burden by RT-PCR and TCID50 assay (McBride et al., 2017). Subjects with a maximum nasal concentration (C\nmax) greater than the median nasal C\nmax value had shorter times to resolution of viral shedding compared with volunteers in the placebo group (median 75.8 vs 113.7 hours). Further trials are planned in hospitalized patients, comparing a high and low dose of MHAA4549A plus oseltamivir, compared to oseltamivir alone NCT02293863.

In a lethal BALB/c mouse model of A(H7N9) virus infection, VIS410 was administered via intraperitoneal injection of either a single 50 mg/kg dose 12 hours before or treated with 2, 10, or 50 mg/kg dose 24 hours after infection (Baranovich et al., 2016, McKimm-Breschkin and Fry, 2016). Prophylactic administration of the antibody resulted in 100% protection of the mice; a single administration of 50 mg/kg 24 hours after infection also provided 100% survival, whereas the 10 mg/kg dose protected 70% of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-infected (oseltamivir sensitive) and 90% of the A/Shanghai/1/2013 virus-infected mice (oseltamivir resistant). The A(H7N9) has undergone recent changes in pathogenicity (Su et al., 2017), with mutations in the HA, including an E57A substitution in the mAb binding region. However, this mutation did not lead to loss of VIS410 binding.",

To date no resistance in vitro or from patient samples has been detected. It was reported at the previous isirv-AVG conference that in two Phase II dose finding trials there was no significant benefit in the first, and in the second there was a statistically significant decrease in the time to resolution of 6 symptoms, but not for fever (McKimm-Breschkin and Fry, 2016). There was also a more rapid decrease in virus titers compared to the placebo group. In two Phase III trials, for healthy adults with uncomplicated influenza, (NCT02026349, NCT02008344) patients were treated with two loading doses of 1800 mg on day 1, and 800 mg BID days 2\u20135. The adverse effect profile appears to be similar to untreated patients, with the exception of asymptomatic elevations of uric acid. Both trials showed a significant antiviral effect with time to undetectable virus by culture shortened by one day. In two of the Phase II and III studies there was an approximately 17% decrease in time to resolution of symptoms. In one trial, there was a much shorter time to resolution of symptoms in the placebo group, thus making it harder to show a full 24 hours decrease in the treated group. There was a 15 hours difference in one trial, and only a 6 hours difference in the other. However, there were different strains of virus predominating in the two trials. Analysis of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a measure of systemic inflammation showed the difference in time to resolution of symptoms between placebo and favipiravir-treated subjects increased with higher NLRs. They are currently analyzing retained PK samples for cytokine levels, to further explore the concept of increasing benefit in patients with more inflammation.",

It blocks maturation of the influenza HA at a post-translational level (Rossignol, 2014). For paramyxoviruses it targets the F protein folding, by inhibiting, ERp57 a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family located in the endoplasmic reticulum, (Piacentini et al., 2016). Silencing of the ERp57 in cell culture decreased virus replication. NTZ also appears to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines in PBMC. In an earlier Phase IIb/III trial in recipients with acute uncomplicated influenza 600 mg, but not 300 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction in the duration of symptoms of up to 36 hours, and a 1 log10 decrease in virus titer (Haffizulla et al., 2014). In total, Phase II/III clinical trials in 2889 patients with uncomplicated influenza A and B, showed that the drug reduced the duration of the influenza illness when compared to placebo (P < 0.05) (Stachulski et al., 2017). In two recently completed RDBPCT Phase III trials (NCT01610245), NTZ given orally 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy for 5 days was compared with NTZ in combination with oseltamivir, and with oseltamivir alone. Overall, there was no difference in the time to resolution of symptoms between the NTZ, oseltamivir, and NTZ and oseltamivir combination vs the placebo groups. In one subset of these studies, among 324 patients aged 12\u201365, the mean time to resolution of symptoms was 32 hours compared to placebo, which was significant. Daily monitoring of these patients was thought to lead to the better outcome.",

Umifenovir binds in a hydrophobic cavity in the HA trimer stem at the interface between two protomers. By functioning as molecular glue, umifenovir stabilizes the prefusion conformation of HA that inhibits the large conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion in the low pH of the endosome (Kadam and Wilson, 2017). In cell culture, umifenovir inhibits replication of both influenza A and B viruses, including A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), A(H5N1), A(H7N9) and NAI-resistant viruses. Resistance arose after serial passaging of an A/Chicken/Germany/27 (H7N7) virus in culture, with amino acid substitutions in the HA2 subunit (Leneva et al., 2009). Mice challenged with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus were treated orally with 20, 30 or 60 mg/kg/day of umifenovir. Only 60 mg/kg enhanced survival, 50% compared to 0% in the placebo group (Leneva et al., 2016). Lung virus titers were decreased by \u2265 2 logs in the umifenovir-treated mice. Retrospective observational studies have been carried out on the 2010\u20132011 (Leneva et al., 2016) and 2014\u20132015 seasons with 5287 patients hospitalized with ILI who were treated with 4 \u00d7 200 mg umifenovir or 2 \u00d7 75 mg oseltamivir within 48 hours of symptom onset. Duration of fever in influenza-infected patients treated with umifenovir (<2 years old) was 4.13 days and 2.45 days (>65 years old), respectively as compared to 3.67 and 4.27 for age matched untreated groups. This characteristic was 3.55 in umifenovir-treated high risk patients compared to 4.55 for untreated high risk patients. In the 2010-11 studies, no significant differences were found in the duration of illness and main symptoms of influenza between the umifenovir and oseltamivir treated groups. Pneumonia as a complication of influenza was observed in 0.3% of the patients treated with umifenovir, in 23.7% of the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy (P < 0.001), and in none of the patients treated with oseltamivir. However, it was noted there was poor compliance with the four times daily dosing, and a long acting formulation is needed, as well as PK and PD studies.",

The highest incidence of AEs was in the placebo group (57%), followed by DNX+OS (44%), DNX (20%) and OS (0%) groups. In all treatment groups, mean peripheral neutrophils decreased from baseline to day 3, increased on day 5 while on therapy, and resolved by day 8. There were no confirmed bacterial AEs in patients with neutropenia (n = 7), all of whom were influenza positive. This agrees with COPD studies in which no bacterial AEs were observed in patients treated with 75 mg daily for 52 weeks. There was a trend toward shorter median times to resolution of all 10 influenza symptoms in the DNX+OS group (112 hours) than in the OS group (267 hours), although the latter was unexpectedly longer than the placebo.

To date, an RSV vaccine is unavailable and there are a number of challenges impeding its development: 1) young age status of patients with serious disease, 2) multiple viral mechanisms to interfere with induction and effector function of Type I interferon, 3) failure of natural immunity to protect against reinfections, 4) traditionally difficult to boost responses in adults, 5) legacy of vaccine-enhanced disease (Graham, 2017). RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein mediates viral entry into the cells and is a primary antigenic target for vaccine development. Recent advances towards defining RSV (F)-specific neutralization-sensitive epitopes and solving the structure of the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the trimer of F glycoprotein (McLellan et al., 2013) have led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization, serological responses to natural RSV infection and vaccination, pathogenesis of disease, and mechanisms of viral inactivation (Liang et al., 2015). Elucidating the structure and function of F glycoprotein has led to the design of a vaccine antigen that recapitulates the surface of the functional pre-F molecule. Stabilizing the pre-F through mutagenesis has further improved its immunogenicity. In a primary infection in infants, there is more antibody against the post-F, which have poor neutralizing ability. In contrast, most antibodies in adults recognize the pre-F form. Clinical trials of a pre-F RSV vaccine started in February 2017.",

The prefusion trimer structures for multiple S glycoproteins of beta-CoV have been solved alone and in complex with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016), suggesting that it may be possible to define a universal solution for stabilizing CoV prefusion S trimers by mutagenesis to produce highly stable and immunogenic CoV vaccine antigens. Immunogens based on full-length S plasmid DNA and S1 subunit protein elicit robust serum-neutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in mice and non-human primates (Wang et al., 2015).

New technologies (particularly structural biology, rapid isolation of human monoclonal antibodies, high-through sequencing, protein engineering, single-cell analysis, and their derivatives) have provided new strategies for influenza vaccines. Influenza HA has discreet structurally-defined sites of vulnerability, and specific antibody lineages have been defined that can provide broad immunity. Antigen designs for influenza HA based on full-length HA, HA stem, or HA receptor-binding site have been produced to pursue distinct strategies for eliciting cross-protective antibody response (Yassine et al., 2015).

This reduction in vaccine effectiveness may be partially explained by lower immune responses after vaccination in this population (Goodwin et al., 2006). Plant-made virus-like particles (VLPs) resembling influenza may be more immunogenic than split-virus formulations. VLPs lack genetic material, but mimic viral structure displaying the targeted protein of interest. To develop the VLP for influenza, recombinant monomeric HA protein from influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana (a close relative of the tobacco plant) using transient expression vectors. The plants are then harvested, and plant-produced VLPs are recovered by fractionation. To evaluate immunogenicity, young (6\u20138 weeks) and aged (16\u201320 months) female BALB/c mice were given a single dose of HA (3 \u03bcg) by either the intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) route. There were two controls: first were mice given influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 split vaccine by IM injection, and second were unvaccinated mice. At three weeks post-vaccination, HAI antibodies were only detected in the young H1-VLP IM group (geometric mean titer, 14.5). Mice were challenged IN with a sublethal dose or lethal dose of influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus. After viral challenge, the young H1-VLP IM group lost the least amount of weight and had 100% survival, as did the young H1N1 split IM group. Aged mice vaccinated by IM administration with the VLP also had minimal weight loss and had 80% survival compared to the split vaccine that had 60% survival. When standardized to the young na\u00efve mice, the young VLP IM vaccine group had the greatest fold decrease in viral load (0.852) compared to other vaccine groups. Among the aged animals, the groups that received VLP by IM or IN routes had the greatest fold decrease (0.928 and 0.925, respectively) when compared to the na\u00efve and split vaccine groups.

The encoded antigens can be rapidly changed, matching evolving viral strains, since each mRNA is produced from the same basic material in the same production site. RNActive\u00ae is one such mRNA based vaccine platform. Initial studies with an intradermal influenza RNActive\u00ae vaccine gave similar HAI titers in mice (1:320) when compared to quadrivalent split virus vaccine (1:160). A newer formulation of the RNActive\u00ae vaccine with lipid encapsulation enables IM delivery. RNActive\u00ae was able to induce potent immune responses when applied IM using low doses (\u03bcg) of mRNA, giving 64-fold higher HAI titers as compared to quadrivalent non-encapsulated RNActive\u00ae and quadrivalent split virus vaccine. Vaccination of mice with this RNActive\u00ae formulation encoding for influenza HA revealed an increase of both humoral and cellular immune responses, analyzed via functional antibody levels and ICS (intracellular cytokine staining) of T cells, respectively, compared to previous RNActive\u00ae formulations. In non-human primate studies, 10 \u03bcg of the lipid encapsulation formulation for the quadrivalent RNActive\u00ae vaccine gave good antibody titers that did not decline over 1 year, and better cellular immune responses as measured by the intracellular cytokine staining of T cells.",

A wild-type non-egg-adapted virus may be better for a challenge model. An influenza A/Belgium/4217/2015(H3N2) virus was propagated 2 times in MDCK cells and a single passage in egg. Three cohorts of 12 healthy volunteers each were intranasally inoculated with increasing doses of influenza A/Belgium/4217/2015 A(H3N2) (cohort 1 = 105; cohort 2 = 106; cohort 3 = 6.76 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL). Inclusion criteria included a MN titer of less than or equal to 1:20 against the challenge strain. Overall attack rates (defined by at least two consecutive positive viral load by qRT-PCR) were 75% for cohort 1 and 2, and 100% for cohort 3.

The focus of the current therapies under development is however on patients with underlying illnesses or those hospitalized with severe disease (Treanor et al., 2000) in whom there is a lack of formal evidence of efficacy of current licensed agents. This is further complicated by the lack of validated clinical endpoints for efficacy studies in severely ill patients (Ison et al., 2010). Clinical endpoints can include time to resolution of fever, or time to normalization of vital signs such as respiratory or heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, or mortality. Endpoints in hospitalized patients are problematic due to the heterogeneity of clinical backgrounds and disease severities at admission, (de Jong et al., 2014, Marty et al., 2017). Other endpoints can include patient reported outcomes, such as the FluiiQ\u2122 questionnaire (Osborne et al., 2011), or the Flu-Pro\u00a9 survey (Powers et al., 2016). Virological endpoints have shown good correlation with clinical measures (Carrat et al., 2008) and virus load at admission has been shown to correlate with the length of hospital stay (Clark et al., 2016). Virus load may thus minimize the issues around the heterogeneity of the population. Additionally it is not ethical to carry out placebo controlled trials, so the current requirement is to prove superiority to the standard of care, which is usually oseltamivir therapy, which has remained a challenge (de Jong et al., 2014). A combination of clinical and virological endpoints may be necessary to achieve consistency.",

New antivirals are being dealt with individually within so-called scientific advice procedures. The Europeans Medicine Agency (EMA) has a concept paper on Guidelines for new influenza therapeutic under development. The therapy needs to show it is effective in severe influenza, safe and well tolerated, has high potency, is rapid acting and has a longer treatment window than the NAIs, low likelihood of resistance emerging, and is effective against known resistant strains. It may be more effective in combination with another therapy, a single treatment is preferable and results in a decrease in virus load. None of the currently approved drugs has demonstrated a clinical benefit in an RCT in patients with severe influenza disease. Challenge studies do not always reflect the natural infection, and results in previously healthy populations do not extrapolate to those with severe disease. In patients at risk of complicated influenza heterogeneity with respect to baseline status and severity of disease as well as type and severity of complications may lead to difficulties in designing a valid study. Due to pre-existing immunity, data from adults may not always be extrapolated to children. Studies in severe influenza have used time to normalization of vital signs or respiratory function. Another endpoint is based on an ordinal scale at a given point in time after first administration of study drug with death > ICU with mechanical ventilation > ICU w/o mechanical ventilation > hospital floor > hospital discharge, suggested (King et al., 2016). A draft EU-guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of influenza is envisaged to be released in early 2018.",

To understand clinical and institutional attitudes towards clinical trial design for the hospitalized influenza population, BARDA conducted a feasibility study by sending a questionnaire to 339 clinical investigators who had worked on previous hospitalized infectious disease clinical trials. They were questioned about three potential arms of a trial, 1) oseltamivir, 2) oseltamivir + new drug, 3) new drug monotherapy. 104 unique responses from 26 countries were received. Topics covered the SOC for hospitalized influenza patients as well as the feasibility of using investigational drug monotherapy for hospitalized subjects. Most clinicians listed NAIs as SOC at their institution (80\u201390%) regardless of global region; however, the percentage of patients who receive a NAI varies by region and is lower than SOC would predict (50\u201360%). Most clinicians believed a clinical study protocol including an investigational drug only arm would be allowed by their institution (60\u201370%), but when asked about the likelihood of Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee approval, only 60% of US participants versus >80% of European participants thought approval would be given. In the United States, 60% of clinicians believed that including an investigational monotherapy arm would negatively impact their ability to recruit subjects, versus minimal impact in Western Europe. Given the other challenges already present for hospitalized influenza clinical trials, including an investigational drug monotherapy arm could restrict the clinical sites available for the study and hamper the ability to recruit subjects.",

Influenza, parainfluenza and RSV generally cause more severe infections than rhinoviruses. In SOT patients, diagnosis can be difficult as 20% may not have fever at presentation. Degree of lymphopenia at onset of disease (higher risk with CD4 \u2264100 c/mL) and transplant type also affect severity (allo-HSCT > auto-HSCT; lung > other SOT). The respiratory viruses cause a range of acute direct effects (i.e. viral pneumonia) and long-term complications (bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) and late onset airflow obstruction). Early antiviral therapy with oseltamivir resulted in lower progression to pneumonia, reduced need for ICU-level care, lower mortality and lower incidence of BOS for influenza (Kumar et al., 2010). In the event of resistance to oseltamivir, treatment with zanamivir is initiated. Two Phase II studies of ALN-RSV01 provided proof of principal for anti-RSV therapy reducing development of BOS in lung transplant recipients (Waghmare et al., 2016). Studies in hospitalized infants are underway of ALS-8176, a nucleoside analog targeting RSV polymerase and Phase II trials are underway in hospitalized and adults transplant recipients for GS-5806 an oral RSV entry inhibitor (Waghmare et al., 2016). The replacement of inhaled ribavirin with oral ribavirin is now also being investigated. DAS181, an inhaled sialidase, is undergoing clinical development for the treatment of PIV in adults and children (Russell and Ison, 2017, Waghmare et al., 2015) although there has been some failure reported, due to coinfection with bacteria or fungus.",

In comparisons to controls, high-dose corticosteroids (>150 mg/d methylprednisolone eqv) was associated with increased risks of 30 day mortality (38.5% vs 7.7%, P = 0.021) and 60 day mortality (50% vs 15.4%, P = 0.022) and longer viral shedding (15 vs 13 days, P = 0.039) in patients with A(H7N9) viral pneumonia, while there was no difference between low dose (25\u2013150 mg/d methylprednisolone) and controls (Cao et al., 2016). In a study of critically ill patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), addition of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Sirolimus 2 mg/d for 14 days to oseltamivir and prednisolone (n = 19) was associated with a higher frequency of liberation from IMV (84.2 vs 47.4%, P = 0.04), a shorter duration of IMV (13.8 vs 33 days, P = 0.03) and a higher chance of achieving lower respiratory tract viral RNA negativity by day 7 (75% vs 33%, P < 0.05) than without addition of Sirolimus (n = 19) (Wang et al., 2014a). A study of adults hospitalized for A(H3N2) has shown that a triple combination of 2 days of clarithromycin 500 mg, naproxen 200 mg and oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily, followed by 3 days of oseltamivir reduced both 30- and 90-day mortality and length of hospital-stay versus oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily without placebo for 5 days as control (Hung et al., 2017). In contrast, another RCT comparing dual therapy of oseltamivir and azithromycin against oseltamivir alone has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects with adjunctive macrolide treatment in adults with severe influenza infections although virus control was unimpaired (Lee et al., 2017). Exploratory post-hoc meta-analysis of studies of SARS and severe influenza showed a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following convalescent treatment vs placebo or no therapy (OR 0\u00b725; 95% CI 0\u00b714 to 0\u00b745) (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015).",

The issues remain over determining appropriate clinical and virological endpoints for antiviral therapies. Baseline clinical parameters are clearly different for previously healthy patients, compared to high risk and hospitalized patients. In clinical trials, new influenza virus inhibitors showed potency in decreasing virus titers in the upper respiratory tract, like VX787/JNJ63623872 and triple combination therapy of oseltamivir, ribavirin and amantadine, however there was no improvement in the clinical benefit. In contrast, the broadly neutralizing VIS410 anti HA monoclonal antibody led to both an earlier decrease in virus levels as well as earlier resolution of symptoms. Both an RSV anti-F (GS-5806) and polymerase inhibitor (ALS-008112) showed some promise with greater reductions in virus load and decreased mucus weights compared to the placebo groups. The NIAID has been very supportive of trying to facilitate development of novel therapies and vaccines for respiratory viruses, but given the seasonal nature of these viruses, enrolling sufficient patients in clinical trials remains challenging, especially when multiple therapies are in the pipeline for trials.",
