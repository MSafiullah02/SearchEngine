            "text": "Nowadays, the quality of the patient care delivery system (PCDS), particularly, disease diagnosis and treatment are mostly medical device-dependent [1]. In the meantime, the development of patient care delivery is found significant in different countries [2]. However, the quality of patient care (QPC) allied with the performance outcomes of medical and surgical equipment has not been explored yet in detail [3]. The patients\u2019 satisfaction absolutely depends on the QPC and can be achieved by reduction of risk factors (patient injuries, unnatural patients\u2019 deaths, etc.) caused by medical and surgical equipment under medical conditions [2, 4]. The risk factors associated with medical devices are studied by Hossain et al. [5]. It is found that the patients\u2019 risk factors can be reduced by applying engineering and managerial skills to healthcare technology by means of clinical engineering approach (CEA) [5, 6]. In this study, the performance of patient care is investigated in terms of the performance outcomes of healthcare technology considering its five key parameters that is why the term health technology management system can be used as a patient care technology management system (PCTMS) [7]. It is noted that high-income countries like Japan, Belgium, America, etc., already adopted CEA in their patient care technology management system (PCTMS). Consequently, patient safety and effective care of these countries are found to improve significantly than that of many upper-middle and lower-middle-income countries like Malaysia, South Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. [8, 9]. The PCDS of developing countries are found inferior from a study conducted by Hossain et al. [5]. In this study, the role of clinical engineers for improving the health care technology management system is pointed out. It is well established that without CEA in PCTMS it is not possible to improve QPC.",

There are no straight forward standard ways to establish a clinical engineering department (CED) in a hospital. In Japanese hospitals, CEDs are formed with the excess number of employees, so their approach is costly. On the other hand, some countries like Jordan, South Africa, India, etc. established CEDs with an insufficient number of employees. Contrary to that some countries (Indonesia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc.) are providing patient care services without establishing CEDs in their hospitals [8]. To best of our knowledge, there is no mathematical model to evaluate QPC quantitatively taking into account of CEA in PCDS.",

The model mainly consists of three subsections: CED, PCTMS, and health care engineering directorate (HCED). Here, we have proposed a cost-effective model for CED as well as for HCED which will act as a regulatory authority of PCTMS. The performance parameters of each subsection are defined and their characteristics are explained. Using multiple linear regression equations, the standard performance equations of CED (GP), PCTMS (AP) and HCED (AF) are proposed and then least-square normal equations are derived. The regression coefficients of these equations are solved by using the standard data collected from 1000 beds in modern hospitals having different types of medical equipment users departments [9, 10]. The model is applied to evaluate the QPC of different countries with CEDs and without CEDs. The results obtained from the model clearly demonstrate that the QPC of the countries where the appropriate implementation of PCTMS is performed by CEDs found to be at a satisfactory level, that is, in case of Japan, it is 84.69%. On the other hand, it is found to be at a marginal level, that is, 53.14% and 52.10%, respectively, for Slovene (SVN) and Belgium (BEL). For some countries like India, Pakistan, Jordan, South Africa, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, etc. the value of QPC is very poor and even it is not possible to evaluate the QPC for some countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri-Lanka due to unavailability of model data in their hospitals [8, 11].",

But, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) mentioned that the components of quality-care can be defined on the conceptual components rather than the measured indicators, that is, it must be safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Thus safety is the foundation upon which all other aspects of quality-care are built [1, 12, 13]. Since our main objective is to ensure patient safety, it is considered as a key parameter to evaluate the QPC. The patient safety, on the other hand, depends on the appropriate application of PCTMS, that is, on the performance outcomes of medical and surgical equipment. According to the definition of IOM, patient safety is the prevention of harm to patients [6, 14]. In the patient safety network website, the Agencies for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have defined the term \u201cprevention of harm\u201d as \u201cfreedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care\u201d [6]. From the above statements, it is cleared that the prevention of harm to patients\u2019 is the reduction of risk factors related to medical and surgical equipment.",

            "text": "To ensure the scheduled life span of medical equipment recommended by the manufacturer, it is very much important to keep the management coefficient of the equipment in a safe functional condition [15]. This can be done by introducing CEA in PCTMS, that is, with the quality outcome of the CED model [11]. Standard clinical equipment management coefficients depend on the preventive maintenance (PM) score, risk score, and functionality score of medical and surgical equipment that are used for ensuring the quality of patient care. These scores are medical equipment dependent. A common formula is used in previous studies [11,15] to define the maximum score for different types of medical equipment that have been actively used for patient care. In this study, we consider 10 numbers of equipment including four categories (diagnostic, therapeutic, life recovery and monitoring). As an example, the maximum management coefficient score of a cardiac defibrillator is 20 and the safe score is 16 [15]. When this score goes above 16, it is required to perform the performance evaluation test of this equipment every six months\u2019 interval as PM for achieving the safety and timely outcomes from PCTMS [15]. However, these outcomes are highly dependent on the performance outcome of CED [11, 16]. Applying PM methodologies, the risk factors of equipment can be minimized and thus patient safety can be ensured. So the quality outcomes of CED are strongly dependent on the appropriate number of skilled staffs of CED model, which depends on the numbers of medical equipment, complexity of equipment, and the intensity of medical equipment technology ability in a modern hospital [11, 16, 17], that is, on the workload of the hospital. The number of skilled staff in the CED of a hospital absolutely depends on the number of medical and surgical equipment rather than the patient\u2019s capacity of a hospital [9, 11, 13]. Here we have considered manpower setup for the CED of different level of hospitals (1000-1500beds) having 108 to 325 staffs with the following designations: Director clinical engineering (DCE), Senior clinical engineer (Sr. CE), Assistant clinical engineer (ACE), Clinical engineering technologist (CET), and Biomedical equipment technician (BMET) [9, 18] to ensure 24 h services. It is to be noted that the skills of staff are determined by some core indicators such as educational qualification, CE certification, training, and duration of working experiences in this field [18, 19].",

The regulatory authority is established with the power to enforce regulations regarding occupational health and safety [20\u201321]. According to the statement of regulatory authority, the standard performance outcome of PCTMS is necessary at the national level. In this study, an HCED (healthcare engineering directorate) is proposed as a regulatory authority that regulates the performance of PCTMS to ensure the QPC [22\u201323]. The regulatory authority formed by highly skilled clinical engineers such as Chief CE, Principle CE, Senior CE, and Basic grade CE [18\u201319]. According to data in [18\u201319], and human resources for directorate general of health services (DGHS), four constant parameters can be considered for developing a standard model of HCED. These include (i) a chief clinical engineer (CCE), (ii) a director of clinical engineering (DCE), (iii) a clinical engineering manager (CEM), and (iv) a senior clinical engineer (Sr. CE). The number of staff in HCED depends on the workload, that is, the total number of modern hospitals in a country/the total number of medical and surgical equipment/the total numbers of staff in different CEDs under the healthcare system of a country [8\u20139, 23\u201324]. These data are necessary to develop a standard model of HCED as well as to evaluate the performance of HCED for ensuring the standard on-time response indicator.",

To confirm patient safety, it is required to keep medical equipment in safe & functional condition by implementing appropriate PCTMS as mentioned by Hossain [11] and Sezdi [15]. There is a strong correlation among the PCTMS, CED, and HCED, which is presented in Fig. 1. To ensure patient satisfaction medical devices must be safe, functional, and timely interfaced with the patient as seen in Fig. 1. These, in turn, depend on the appropriate activities of CED for implementing the PCTMS.

Thus, patient risk factors such as patient injury and unnatural death related to medical and surgical equipment can be reduced significantly. The performance evaluation test and audit belong to the PM, inspection and appetence test.

Continuous monitoring of GP performance could be a better way for understanding and identifying the real causes of performance degradation and thereby necessary actions can be taken promptly for improving it. There is no standard method to evaluate the performance of GP as reported so far [11]. Different engineering methodologies are normally used in different countries [21]. The conventional methodology is commonly used in lower-middle-income countries like Bangladesh, in which the staffs\u2019 positions, as well as their numbers, are selected without taking into account of workload. That is, not on the basis of the number of medical and surgical equipment and the amount of medical equipment technology ability of different hospitals. As a result, the performance of GP is not at a satisfying level. It is well established that the performance of GP is strongly dependent on the number of FETs. So, if a CED is formed with insufficient staffs the performance of GP will be lost; on the other hand; overstaffing will be very much expensive and time-consuming.",

In some countries, the performance of PCDS is found to be at a very unsatisfactory level, which may be due to the fact that they did not introduce CEA in their HCDS [8\u20139, 11]. This implies that the model is able to explain the QPC of the countries where CEA has been introduced or not. Thus, the proposed model is universal and any country/hospital can easily evaluate the present status of QPC and then take necessary action accordingly. Our model also helps to identify which module/subsection needs to improve for the overall performance improvement.",

It is well established that patient satisfaction depends on quality-care and cost-effective-care that can be achieved by on-time interfacing of safe and functional medical devices to the patients. Without introducing CEA in PCDS it is impossible to interface safe and functional medical devices timely and safely. This is clearly identified from the analysis of the data collected from different hospitals of high, upper-middle, and lower-middle-income countries of the world. Although the patient\u2019s satisfaction level has been increased by some high-income countries like Japan, Belgium, Slovene, etc., by introducing CEA in their PCDS, there is no mathematical tool to evaluate QPC quantitatively. Here we have presented a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively by introducing CEA in PCDS following the analogy of control theory. Different subsections of the models and their correlation with PCDS, FTEs required in a CED and their dependency with the number of beds of a hospital and MEUDs are also clarified. Furthermore, the characteristics of model parameters are defined and the technological weights of these parameters are proposed based on the standard data collected from different hospitals of the world. The performance equations of the model are standardized using the multiple linear regression method. Finally, the model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC in different 18 countries including high- middle-, and low-income countries. The results obtained from the model indicate that the impact of CEA in PCDS is very much significant and play a vital role to ensure the QPC of a country. The model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital or a country and it facilitates identifying which subsections of the model (CED/PCTMS/HCED) need to improve for ensuring QPC. The outcome of this study clearly explains the impact of clinical engineering professionals in PCTMS for ensuring QPC and hence to prevent medical equipment-dependent risk factors, that are related to different adverse events such as patient injuries, unnatural patient\u2019s death and reduction of healthcare cost, etc.",
