In the (rare) circumstances that HSV or VZV becomes resistant to the acyclic (or carbocyclic) guanosine analogs due to TK deficiency (TK\u2212), the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet (14) could be useful for treating TK\u2212 HSV or TK\u2212 VZV infections (in immunocompromised patients).\n\n",

For RSV the only approved antiviral therapy is aerosol administration of ribavirin. In practice, however, ribavirin is rarely used owing to the technical burden of delivery by aerosol under the given circumstances (RSV bronchopneumonitis in young infants). Given the high incidence of RSV infections (which are often diagnosed as influenza), there is a high (and as yet unmet) medical need for an appropriate therapy (and prophylaxis) of RSV infections; the same holds for hMPV infections, which usually occur during the same (winter) season as RSV, mainly in young children, elderly people, and immunocompromised individuals. Ribavirin certainly holds promise for the treatment of hMPV infections, as has recently been demonstrated in the mouse model for hMPV.159 Also, as has been mentioned above for HCV,106 siRNA may also be applicable, if properly designed and administered (intranasally) in the treatment of respiratory virus infections.160\n",

An even greater number of compounds are under clinical or preclinical development, with again, as many targeting HIV as all the other viruses taken together. This implies that HIV, since its advent, has remained the main target in antiviral drug development. Antiviral agents can, as guided by the anti-HIV agents as examples, be divided in roughly five categories: (1) nucleoside analogs, (2) nucleotide analogs (or acyclic nucleoside phosphonates), (3) nonnucleoside analogs, (4) protease inhibitors, and (5) virus\u2013cell fusion inhibitors. Molecular targets are for (1) and (2) the viral DNA polymerase (whether DNA-dependent as in the case of herpesviruses, or RNA-dependent as in the case of HIV or HBV); for (3) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), associated with HIV, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase) associated with HCV; for (4) the proteases associated with HIV and HCV; and for (5) the fusion process of HIV (and, potentially, other viruses such as the SARS coronavirus and RSV). Antiviral agents may also exert their antiviral effects through an interaction with cellular targets such as IMP dehydrogenase (ribavirin) and SAH hydrolase (3-deazaneplanocin A). The latter enzymes are essential for viral RNA synthesis (through the supply of GTP) and viral mRNA maturation (through 5'-capping), respectively. Finally, interferons (now generally provided in their pegylated form) may be advocated in the therapy of those viral infections (actually, HBV and HCV; prospectively, Coxsackie B, SARS, \u2026) that, as yet, cannot be sufficiently curbed by other therapeutic measures.",
