A strategy for chemotherapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites -such as reactive oxygen species and arginine-directed glycating agent, methylglyoxal -for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2. Sequence analysis of functional domains in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome showed 0.8-fold depletion of cysteine residues and 4.9-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting methylglyoxal modification may inactivate the virus. We discovered the peptide motif for MG modification: 3 -5-fold enrichment of cationic residues preceding the target arginine. There was 5-fold enrichment of methylglyoxal modification sites in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, compared to the human host -indicating selective toxicity of methylglyoxal to the virus. We found antitumor drugs, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, increase cellular methylglyoxal to virucidal levels. Taken together, these findings reveal a proteomic vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to methylglyoxal modification and provide a rationale for repurposing doxorubicin and paclitaxel for COVID-19 treatment. leakage of electron flux in oxidative phosphorylation, by oxidases and other sources. They are metabolized by antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins (Sies et al., 2017). The reactive dicarbonyl metabolite, MG, is formed mainly by trace level degradation of triosephosphate glycolytic intermediates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate, and is metabolised by glutathione-dependent glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) of the glyoxalase pathway (Rabbani et al., 2016b) (Figure 1A). The most susceptible targets in proteins to modification by ROS are cysteine residues which are oxidised to cystine and cysteine sulfenic and sulfonic acids (Sies et al., 2017). The most susceptible targets in proteins to modification by MG are arginine residues 4 which are glycated to hydroimidazolone MG-H1 with loss of charge, all related electrostatic interactions and, typically, resistance to proteolytic cleavage close to the site of modification (Figure 1B) (Rabbani et al., 2016b). Key to exploring if reactive metabolites of the host may be exploited to produce a virucidal response against SARS-CoV-2 is to identify proteomic vulnerabilities of the virus. Currently it is unknown if target amino acid residues of reactive metabolites are enriched in functional domains of the viral proteome, and if these targets are enriched in the viral proteome, compared to the human host. It also unknown if there are investigational new drugs or current clinically approved drugs that increase reactive metabolites to virucidal levels in the cellular environment where SARS-CoV-2 undergo cell fusion and propagation.",

Pharmacological increase of reactive metabolites will then produce a virucidal effect and therapeutic response for disease. Important reactive metabolites producing major quantitative modification of the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and methylglyoxal (MG) (Rabbani et al., 2016b; Sies et al., 2017) . Key to characterizing the vulnerability of the viral proteome to reactive metabolites, ROS and MG, is location of their susceptible amino acid residue targets in functional domains of viral proteins and activation of these residues towards reaction with reactive metabolites. ROS are formed by mitochondria through trace the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; www.uniprot.org). We found a similar prevalence of cysteine and arginine residues in the viral proteome: 3.14% and 3.63%, respectively (Table   1) . We applied the sequence-based receptor binding domain (RBD) analysis to identify functional domains of proteins of the viral proteome to thereby deduce the prevalence of cysteine and arginine residue targets therein. In optimised format, RBD analysis is applicable to all proteins and involves a plot of mean hydrophobicity against mean dipole moment of a widow of 5 amino acid residues moved sequentially along the sequence of a protein (with a gyration angle between two consecutive residues in the sequence of 100\u00b0 assumed). This approach had 80% accuracy when validated against a database of known interacting proteins (Gallet et al., 2000) . Functional domains are located in a trapezium-shaped domain on the top-left side of the plot -regions of low mean hydrophobicity and high mean dipole moment of proximate groups of amino acid residues. An example of the RBD analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is given ( Figure 1C ). This analysis showed that 4.8% of cysteine residues were in functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome whereas a much greater proportion of arginine residues, 30.7%, were in functional domains. The enrichment of arginine residues in functional domains was 4.9-fold -the highest of any amino acid, whereas there was a slight negative enrichment, 0.8-fold, or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains. Other amino acid residues susceptible to oxidative damage were also depleted in functional domains. Amino acid enrichment in functional domains: met 0.6, tyr 0.8 and trp 0.3 (Table 1 ). The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is, therefore, resistant to oxidative inactivation but susceptible to functional inactivation by MG. For individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the majority had arginine residue enrichment in the functional domains greater than the mean of the human host proteome of ca. 3.5: range 2.3 -13.5 (Fig. 1d) .",

Arginine residue sidechain pKa is decreased by interaction with neighbouring amino acid residues with positively charged sidechains. For an \u03b1-helix, interactions with lysine or arginine residues at positions -4, -3, +3 and +4 in the sequence with respect to the target arginine residue are expected to decrease the arginine target residue pKa by side chain interaction along the side of the helix axis. Longer range interactions occur between these and other types of secondary structure domains in the tertiary structures of proteins. For example, in human serum albumin, neighbouring group interactions with R186, R218 and R410 decrease the pKa values of their sidechain guanidino groups to 12.5, 12.2 and 12.5 from the basal pKa of 13.8 (Fitch et al., 2015) .

In recent studies of the cytosolic proteome of human endothelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro (Irshad et al., 2019; Rabbani et al., 2016a) , we detected 686 unique arginine sites with MG modification -the MG modification motif foreground, and a total of 9,276 unique arginine residue sites -the human argininecontaining peptide background. Making no assumption on protein secondary structure environment of the arginine residue, we compared amino acid frequencies in the proximate sequence around the arginine residues and deduced enrichment of amino acids in the MGmodified peptides to develop the MG modification motif. A remarkable feature is that there was a predominance of activating residues on the N-terminal side of the target arginine residue. This may be linked to the finding that residues with several long range interactions assume a conformation with dihedral angles of \u03c6 and \u03c8 near \u2212120\u00b0 and 140\u00b0; that is, the side chains of arginine residues interacting with other positively charged residues tend to point towards amino acid residues earlier in the sequence (Saravanan and Selvaraj, 2017). On the N-terminal side of the target, there was a 3 -5 fold enrichment of arginine and lysine residues at positions -7 to -2 ( Figure 2A and Table S3 ). We then assessed if the SARS-CoV-2 proteome has evidence of MG modification sites by comparing the proximate sequence to arginine residues in the viral proteome. There are 358 arginine residues in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome -potential MG modification sites (foreground). We compared this SARS-CoV-2 foreground to the human arginine sequence environment proteomic background. We found a 4-fold enrichment of arginine at position -2 in 18 sites and 5-fold enrichments of arginine residues at -4 and -5 at 21 and 17 sites, respectively. This shows there is an enrichment of MG modification sites in the SARS-Cov2-proteome compared to the human host ( Figure 2B and Table S4 ). This provides the basis for selective protein modification and selective toxicity by increase of MG to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Nucleoprotein binds the 3' end of the viral single strand RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 and it is arginine-rich, as is typical of RNA-binding proteins (Tan and Frankel, 1995) . By analogy with SARS-Cov, residues 42-187 are involved with RNA binding with R93 playing a critical role (McBride et al., 2014) . The crystal structure of a segment of nucleoprotein, residues 50 -173, is available and this enabled prediction of pKa values of arginine residues in this region. pKa shifts from 13.8 of inactivated arginine (Fitch et al., 2015) for R93 and R95 indicated ca. 16 and 40-fold increased reactivity towards MG modification, compared to non-activated target residue. These residues lie in a pentad of reactive arginine residues where MG modification at R93 and R95 is expected to inactive the nucleoprotein ( Figure 2D ). The SR-rich region of 182 -196 is important for virus replication (Tylor et al., 2009 ) and is also a target for MG modification and inactivation. MG modification of the nucleoprotein, and also membrane protein, will block viral replication and virion assembly, respectively. (Table 2) .",

These studies used exogenous MG in cellular in vitro models where MG is rapidly metabolized by Glo1 and onward through the glyoxalase pathway to D-lactate (Rabbani et al., 2016b) . The cellular concentration of MG is 1 -4 \u00b5M and the plasma concentration 130 -250 nM (Irshad et al., 2019; Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014; Xue et al., 2016) . The optimum approach to achieve an antiviral effect is to increase cellular MG concentration by inhibition of Glo1. S-p-Bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGD) is a potent cell permeable Glo1 inhibitor prodrug. It delivers the Glo1 competitive inhibitor, S-p-bromobenzylglutathione (Ki = 160 nM), into cells and has established antitumor and antimalarial activity (Thornalley et al., 1996; Thornalley et al., 1994) (Figure 3A ). We studied the effect of BBDG and clinically approved antitumor drugs on the cellular concentration of MG in human HEK293 cells -a cellular model employed for SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Chien et al., 2016) . BBGD increased the endogenous concentration of cellular MG by 4-fold to ca. 20 \u00b5M -a level similar to that with virucidal activity.",

Interestingly, we found clinical antitumor agents, doxorubicin and paclitaxel ( Figure Figure 3D and 3E). When these transfectant cell lines were treated with growth inhibitory concentrations of drugs, there was an increase of median growth inhibitory concentration GC50 value and resistance to inhibition of cell growth in HEK293 cells with stable overexpression of Glo1 ( Figure 3F and 3H). The GC50 values were (mean \u00b1 SD; empty vector vs Glo1+): doxorubicin, 3.54 \u00b1 0.28 nM vs 55.9 \u00b1 3.4 nM (16-fold resistance); paclitaxel -6.8 \u00b1 1.0 nM vs 56.4 \u00b1 7.2 nM (8-fold resistance).

Values cannot be deduced for the two amino acids at the N-and C-termini of proteins and they are therefore missing from the amino acid residue prevalence reports (Gallet et al., 2000) .

Increased MG concentration induced by doxorubicin and paclitaxel is linked to increased glucose metabolism and related increased formation of MG as a byproduct of glycolysis. Indeed, flux of formation of D-lactate -a surrogate indicator of flux of formation of MG -was increased by both drugs (Figure 3C). Increase of cellular MG also likely contributes to the antiproliferative effect of BBGD (Rabbani et al., 2018). The involvement of MG in the antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin and paclitaxel is unknown. We explored the involvement of MG accumulation in the antiproliferative response of doxorubicin and paclitaxel by determining the effect of overexpression of Glo1 on inhibition of HEK293 cell growth. Vector-derived stable transfectant HEK293 cells lines were prepared with Glo1 expression increased 4 -5 fold and empty vector transfectant control (",

            "text": "A further important feature for susceptibility of viral proteins to MG modification is protein abundance or protein copy number. Previous studies of the SARS-CoV virion suggested proteins of high copy number (tens to hundreds) in decreasing copy number orderare: nucleoprotein, M-protein, Spike protein and nsp3 (Neuman et al., 2008). Assuming similar protein copy number of SARS-CoV-2, we have identified MG modification sites in the 3 most abundant proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Although there were most MG modification sites in functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, 16, other coronaviridae -SARS-CoV-2 and MERS -had similar MG modification sites in protein crucial for virion viability -particularly the nucleoprotein protein. This suggests that pharmacological agents increasing cellular concentration of MG, inducing dicarbonyl stress, may have virucidal activity against multiple coronaviridae. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are clinical antiproliferative antitumor agents with mechanisms of action targeting inhibition of topoisomerase-II in DNA replication and stabilization of the interphase and microtubular network and mitotic spindle in mitosis,",

Increased glucose metabolism produces a corresponding increase in the formation of MG -evidenced herein by increase in flux of formation of D-lactate; there may be disproportionately large increase in MG if expression of enzymes of onward metabolism of triosephosphates, triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, are not increased along with hexokinase activity and glycolysis becomes dysregulated or unscheduled (Irshad et al., 2019; Rabbani and Thornalley, 2019).",
