Since the ban of antibiotic growth promoters in the European Union (E.U.) in 2006 (Regulation 1831/2003/EC, 2005), probiotic animal feed supplementation has risen as a viable alternative to antibiotics, as reported for several monogastric or ruminant farm animals (Scharek et al., 2007, Pollmann et al., 2005, Stella et al., 2007; Maragkoudakis et al., submitted). Probiotics (Fuller, 1989, Guarner and Shaafsma, 1998) are comprised primarily of lactic acid bacteria which form part of the normal enteric flora of man and animals. Probiotic feed supplementation may benefit the animal host directly, by preventing the infection and combating the causative agent of the intestinal disorder, or indirectly, by balancing the disrupted equilibrium of the enteric flora and augmenting the host's immune responses.",

TGEV can cause al disease that has very high mortality rates (often 100%) in young piglets and is characterized by vomiting and severe diarrhea, while the symptoms manifest in a milder way in adult pigs with lower severity and mortality rates (Saif and Heckert, 1990). TGEV belongs to the family of coronaviruses and can been encountered globally where intensive pork industry is practiced, causing great economic losses (Sestak and Saif, 2002). RV on the other hand, a member of the Reoviridae family, is better known as being the leading cause of infant and young children diarrhea (Parashar et al., 2003) accounting for more than 500,000 deaths each year in children under five years (WHO epidemiological report, 2007). However, RV is also a common cause of diarrhea in a variety of farm animals such as lambs, calves and pigs (Holland, 1990, Saif and Heckert, 1990), in which the infection severity may range from asymptomatic to fatal, having severe economic implication in animal husbandry.",

Such studies can be limited by their complexity, as well as the ethical and economical implication of using valuable assets such as farm animals in viral diarrhea challenge studies. As an alternative, however, animal intestinal epithelial or macrophage cell line models can be developed and utilized, for studying the interaction between probiotics, viruses, and the host epithelium.",

To assess the antiviral effects, various farm animal cell lines have been co-incubated with the LAB strains prior to their challenge with RV and TGEV viruses. Additional functional properties that relate to the possible underlying mode of action of the antiviral effect have been also studied, including release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the cell lines due to probiotic interaction, as well as the attachment ability of probiotic strains on the cell line monolayers.",

The results obtained are LAB strain specific but also cell-line specific, as variable values are obtained when the same LAB strains are applied to difference cell-lines. None of the LAB strains adversely affected the release of NO\u2212 in any of the cell lines tested.

Recent studies (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007, Ivec et al., 2007) reported the protective effect that various lactic acid bacteria, including the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei F19, conferred upon porcine intestinal epithelial and macrophage cell line infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

            "text": "The elucidation of the underlying mechanism of action of the probiotic strains was attempted also in this study. To this end, we investigated the induction of reactive oxygen species NO\u2212 and H2O2 release (ROS) by cell lines co-incubated with lactic acid bacteria. ROS has a variety of defensive roles in the host, such as killing of intracellular pathogens, tumor cells, but also virus-infected cells (Hibbs et al., 1998, Keyaerts et al., 2004). The antiviral effects of NO\u2212 in particular have been previously reported (Bi and Reiss, 1995, Paludan et al., 1998, Ellermann-Eriksen, 2005). However, over expression of NO\u2212, especially chronic, could have toxic side-effects also for the host cells (Brown, 2003). Another mechanism that could be involved in the anti viral effect is the competition for attachment sites on the epithelial cell surfaces between probiotic bacteria and virus particles. This protective mode of action has already been cited in cell line interactions between probiotic bacteria and intestinal pathogens (Cocconier et al., 2000, Ouwenhand et al., 2001, Lievin-Le Moal et al., 2002; Maragkoudakis et al., 2006), and implied as a possible mechanism of protection against VSV cell line infection (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007, Ivec et al., 2007).",

In the case of L. casei Shirota, the high ROS release in the TLT cell line coincides with a high level of protection against TGEV in the same cell line. However, in all other cases with L. casei Shirota, no correlations can be found between ROS release and antiviral activity. In addition, the low attachment capacity of the strain, reported also elsewhere (Juntunen et al., 2001, Ouwenhand et al., 2001; Maragkoudakis et al., 2006) does not allow for direct linking of attachment ability and antiviral effect. Similar observations can be drawn with L. rhamnosus GG, which, in spite of a low ROS induction and attachment ability in all cell lines, was found to exert a major antiviral effect in both TGEV and RV, in all cell lines tested.",

In addition, on the goat epithelial cell line (GIE) strain PCA236 induced increase release of both NO\u2212 and H2O2. This could explain the antiviral activity obtained on the GIE monolayers with the particular LAB strain, where a notable protective effect against both RV and TGEV was observed. The attachment ability of the same strain however appears to be rather low (~ 10%), and so it is unclear if adhesion could contribute to the antiviral effect. The high-attaching strain L. plantarum ACA-DC146, also able to induce increase ROS release in H4 and TLT, exhibited only low antiviral potential. Similarly, another strain with high-attachment ability, E. faecium PCD71, but no particular ROS release induction, exhibited only a mild antiviral effect on only once cell line (GIE).",

Each LAB-cell line\u2013virus interaction is specific, barring the drawing of general and definite conclusions. It is however evident from the obtained results that probably more than one mechanism may be involved in the observed antiviral effect, as previously hypothesized in similar studies (Boti\u0107 et al., 2007, Ivec et al., 2007). In addition, apart from ROS and attachment, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as interleukins (IL) 6 and 12 or the antiviral interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), is an important mechanism by which probiotic bacteria may protect host cells (Miettinen et al., 1998, Hessle et al., 1999, Maassen et al., 2000, Ivec et al., 2007). The mechanism of action of the antiviral effects reported in this study needs to be further investigated and so a more detailed, holistic approach would need to be adopted, focusing less on the screening of LAB strains against various cell lines and viruses, and more on in depth studies of the phenomenon.",
