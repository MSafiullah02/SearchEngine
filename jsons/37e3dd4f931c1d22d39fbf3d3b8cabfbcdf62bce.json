To perform the TEM, placental tissue 80 samples were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde buffered in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.5, washed in 81 sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in buffered 1% osmium tetroxide, en-bloc stained with a saturated 82 solution of uranyl acetate in 40% ethanol, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, infiltrated in 83 propylene oxide with Epon epoxy resin (LADD LX112, Ladd industries, Burlington, VT), and embedded. 84The blocks were sectioned with a Reichert Ultracut TM microtome at 70 nm. The resulting grids were then 85 post-stained with a 1% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by 0.5% aqueous lead citrate and scoped on a 86Zeiss EM 900 transmission electron microscope retro-fitted with an SIA L3C digital camera (SIA, Duluth, weighed 271 g (75th to 90th percentile). Sections showed mature chorionic villi 91 with focal villous edema and an area of decidual vasculopathy on the maternal surface. Survey from a 92 placental thick section showed the terminal villi containing fetal blood vessels(Figure 1). This area was 93 used for the transmission electron microscopy and contained syncytiotrophoblasts, fibroblasts, 94 endothelial cells, and fetal red blood cells. A single virion was visible invading a syncytiotrophoblast 95 (Figure 2). This virion was again visualized under a higher magnification(Figure 3). A single virion was 96 also visualized in a microvillus(Figure 4). Additionally, at the highest magnification of the mesenchymal 97 core of the terminal villus, likely in the cell processes of fibroblasts, a single virion was visible in one field 98 (Figure 5) as well as two virions in another (Figure 6).",

            "text": "the first visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the human placenta. Using electron 102 microscopy, we were able to identify virions invading syncytiotrophoblasts in placental villi. In addition, 103 we identified SARS-CoV-2 virions in placental villi in the cell processes of fibroblasts. It appears that the 104 cells are fibroblasts which may take the form of myofibroblasts as a result of response to injury or 105 inflammation, in this case by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (6). Our findings further contribute to the evidence of 106 placental infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, there was no evidence of fetal infection. 107 The risk of intrauterine transmission is of particular interest as the SARS-CoV-2 virus utilizes the 108 ACE2 receptor for cell entry and it is known that there is expression of the ACE2 receptor in the human 109 placenta (5). Two recently published studies have provided evidence for the potential for vertical 110 transmission. In a report by Zamaniyan et al (1) there was evidence of potential intrauterine infection in 111 a woman with severe COVID-19 disease who delivered at 32 weeks gestation as shown by positive RT-112 PCR tests for COVID-19 in amniotic fluid as well as repeat neonatal nasal and throat swabs; initial 113 neonatal swabs, as well as vaginal secretions and umbilical cord blood were negative for COVID-19. In a 114 study by Dong et al (2), a neonate born to a mother with COVID-19 infection of at least 20 days duration 115 was shown to have positive IgM and IgG antibodies as well as elevated IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines at two 116 hours of birth while the maternal vaginal secretions were negative for COVID-19. Although the infant 117 was asymptomatic and had multiple negative nasopharyngeal swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2, in utero 118 infection was suspected as IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta and the neonate mounted an 119 innate immune response. There was additional evidence of vertical transmission supported by 120 laboratory results which showed inflammation and liver injury. In contrast, other studies have reported Placental thick section at 1 micron stained with toluidine blue showing the terminal villi 142 containing fetal blood vessels (10X).
