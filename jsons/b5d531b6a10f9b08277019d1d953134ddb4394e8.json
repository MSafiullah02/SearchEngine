In response, there have been systems-based changes within US cardiac surgical programs in efforts to enhance containment measures and to preserve essential resources needed to treat an influx of COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organization identified COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and within days, many cardiac surgical programs made drastic changes to their clinical practices with reductions in surgical volume due to delayed elective cases, reassignment of providers to intensive care settings outside their usual scope of practice, and the integration of virtual clinics for patient evaluation (1) . As these systems-based changes were evolving, guidelines with adequate specificity to address the complexity of decision-making for delaying cardiac surgery were unavailable. As a result, many hospital systems in combination with their heart teams developed program-specific policies. We surveyed US cardiac surgeons to gain insights into the variability of programmatic responses to COVID-19.",

However, at the majority of centers, no patients confirmed to be COVID-19 positive had undergone cardiac surgery (81.7%, n=410). Many programs have transitioned to only providing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery (81.2%, n=408) and adopted the utilization of telemedicine services in either some cases or all nonemergent cases (54.1%, n=262 and 35.9%, n=180, respectively). The majority of programs saw a reduction in greater than 50% of cardiac surgical volume (76.2%, n=383) (Figure 2) . These unknowingly within the COVID-19 incubation period, a practice that has been shown to exacerbate the pulmonary consequences of the virus (4). The balance between COVID-related risks associated with proceeding with surgery versus the risks of cardiovascular complications arising from delaying of non-urgent cardiac operations can be delicate with many unknowns on both sides. In addition, despite recommendations to undergo operative intervention, some patients refuse to come to the hospital out of fear of COVID-19 exposure.

Although reductions in case volume were not significantly associated with the number of reported COVID-19 hospitalizations or practice type, cardiac surgeons in private practice were less likely to utilize telemedicine (96.4% academic vs 85.2% private, p<0.001) and less likely to be involved in policymaking decisions (69.9% academic vs 55.9% private, p=0.007). Respondents found that systems-based responses could be improved with better communication from COVID-19 hospital leadership (21.7%, n=149), greater cardiac surgeon involvement in policymaking (23.3%, n=160), and greater access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline providers (35.6%, n=243). We are in the midst of a global pandemic with an unprecedented scale and pace that has crippled many health care systems and other industries across the US (3). Despite the severity of the ongoing public health crisis, the results of this survey suggest that the majority of cardiac surgical programs responded expeditiously by decreasing elective case volume and implementing telemedicine approaches for patient evaluations. These approaches serve several important purposes. First, reductions in elective case volume help conserve necessary hospital resources such as ventilators and impede transmission of COVID-19 to both patients and hospital providers.
