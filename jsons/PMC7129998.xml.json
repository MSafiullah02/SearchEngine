The prairie dog had been purchased two days earlier at a \u201cswap meet,\u201d where animals were traded or bought. It had become ill on the same day that it bit the child, and at the time was noted to have ocular discharge, lymphadenopathy, and papular skin lesions. It died on May 20, 2003. An enlarged submandibular lymph node noted on the prairie dog was submitted to Marshfield Laboratories (Marshfield, Wisconsin) for bacterial culture. The laboratory isolated a gram-negative bacillus, raising concerns that it might be tularemia or plague; ultimately, it was identified as an acinetobacter species and was considered to be a contaminant. Because no other such cases were reported at the time, the case was thought to be merely an isolated event.4\n",

He had sustained a bite and a scratch from a prairie dog on May 18, and a nodular lesion had developed at the scratch site on March 23, accompanied by fever, chills, sweats, and lymphadenopathy that began on May 26. He had been examined at a local emergency department and released, but by May 31, his condition had worsened and he was hospitalized. Again, tularemia and plague were considered in the differential diagnosis. By June 3, he was linked to the index case: he had sold two prairie dogs to the patient\u2019s family at the swap meet.

The next day, the complete sequence of the hemagglutinin gene taken from the virus of the meat inspector/distributor proved to be identical to hemagglutinin gene sequences derived from one of two reference monkeypox-virus clades. That same day, 11 patients with confirmed or suspected monkeypox were identified in Wisconsin and were linked by direct contact with prairie dogs sold by the meat inspector/distributor. Three patients, the child, her mother, and another family member were in northeastern Wisconsin; the other 8 patients were in southeastern Wisconsin. The latter group was composed of the distributor and his wife, two employees of two different pet stores that had received prairie dogs from the distributor, two veterinarians in different clinics who had treated prairie dogs sold by the distributor, and a person who had purchased a prairie dog from one of the pet stores and her houseguest (Figure 1).Two days later (June 9), PCR analyses of tissue- and virus-culture supernatants from the second patient (mother of the 3-year-old girl) and the prairie dog were positive for monkeypox-virus DNA signatures.4\n",

This probable source of introduction involved a shipment of animals that entered Texas on April 9 and included approximately 800 small mammals. Among nine different species in the shipment were six genera of African rodents: rope squirrels (Funiscuirus spp.), tree squirrels (Heliosciurus spp.), Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp.), brush-tailed porcupines (Atherurus spp.), dormice (Graphiurus spp.), and striped mice (Hybomys spp.). CDC laboratory testing with PCR and virus isolation of some of the animals revealed that one Gambian giant rat, three dormice, and two rope squirrels were infected with monkeypox virus. Evidence of infection also was found in some of the animals that had been separated from the remainder of the shipment on its arrival into the United States. When the Gambian rats arrived in Illinois, they were kept in close proximity to the prairie dogs implicated in the outbreak in Wisconsin and other states.6, 7\n",

That figure represented a large jump from the 30 percent \u201csecondary contact\u201d rate that had been reported by Zdenek Jezek in the studies of the 1981 to 1986 epidemic.11 The 1997 report also included one patient who appeared to have been the source of eight other infections, twice the highest chain of transmission previously noted.8 Other differences also were noted (Table 2). Although some concern had been expressed that the monkeypox was changing and becoming more virulent or more transmissible, such possibilities were eliminated when researchers analyzed part of one isolate from a person infected in 1996 and found no difference between it and strains collected in Zaire between 1970 and 1979.8\n",

One importance of the finding, noted by Anthony S. Fauci, director of NIAID, relates to the search for a replacement vaccine for people with health conditions that preclude their being able to use the current smallpox vaccine. He also noted that an initial MVA injection might help lessen the side effects experienced from Dryvax, the only commercially available smallpox vaccine in the United States, and might serve as an important prevaccine for large-scale vaccination efforts in the event of a bioterror threat involving smallpox.18\n",

The researchers monitored the immune responses throughout the immunization period and later, after the monkeys were exposed to monkeypox. Two months after being given the second vaccination, all 24 monkeys were exposed to monkeypox. All the immunized monkeys remained healthy with no signs of disease except for a small number of lesions on those in the MVA-only group; the unvaccinated monkeys had more than 500 lesions each and became gravely ill or died.19 Studies are ongoing to determine the duration of protection offered by MVA versus Dryvax and the effect of dosage, as well as to evaluate the immune response to MVA in humans.",
