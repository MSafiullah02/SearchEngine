Make the clozapine administration as easy as possible, including rounding doses (600 mg/day may be easier than 575 mg/day) and administering twice a day (1/3 in the morning and 2/3 at night) or only at night, depending upon preference and ADRs. b Studies show great variability; some provide a dose-correction factor of 0.10-0.20, which requires a clozapine dose 10 to 5 times lower. In Beijing Anding Hospital, fluvoxamine is no longer used because a clozapine patient died when co-prescribed fluvoxamine [65] . c Potent inhibitors such as oral contraceptives or high intake of caffeine may require a dose-correction factor of 0.5 [58, 59] . d In Asians our data is limited to outpatient samples with single TDM determinations in which patients with a high body mass index (around 30 and higher) behaved as clozapine PMs [46] . In US obese patients, we recommend TDM since we only have a statistical model [44] and Asian data [46] . e Potent inducers require a dose correction factor of 1.5-2.0. This dose estimation is a rough estimation and it is better to individualize the clozapine dose with TDM. Potent inducers are rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine (the package insert for some countries recommends against the co-prescription of carbamazepine due to its associations with agranulocytosis). There are no studies on high doses of oxcarbazepine (\u22651200 mg/day) or topiramate (\u2265400 mg/day) but they may act as inducers. A case report suggested that topiramate can be a clinically relevant inducer [58] . f We are not ready to provide different dose recommendations for European Caucasians but an Italian outpatient study [45] and unpublished samples made available to the first author suggest that Europeans may need 200-400 mg/day versus 300-600 mg/day in US patients. g On rare occasions, US s\u2642 with potent inducers or valproic acid are UMs and require clozapine doses >1000 mg/day to reach C>350 ng/ml [87] . We do not recommend prescribing doses >1000 mg/day without TDM. Table S2 . Current a recommended clozapine titrations for inpatients. b If any weekly CRP c is abnormal, hold dose escalation until CRP normalizes. Stop fluvoxamine, valproic acid, or oral contraceptives before titration. d ASIANS First week Administer the first dose of 12.5 mg at night to avoid sedation and orthostatic hypotension. e If tolerated, \u2191 daily dose by 12.5 mg, keeping approximately 2/3 at night (avoid \u2191 during weekend). f Target 50 mg/day at the end of the first week.",

This means using Asian titration levels for US outpatients. It is very important for psychiatrists using outpatient titrations to be careful with \u2191 dose and, when possible, supervise vital signs after the first few doses. Similarly, slower titrations are required in inpatients of geriatric age or who are taking medication that increases clozapine risk due to pharmacodynamic drug interactions. For them, consider the titration recommended for East Asians. When possible, stop benzodiazepines before starting clozapine since rare cases of collapse/respiratory arrest have been described, usually in the first 2 days of clozapine titration. c We do not recommend starting clozapine until CRP is normal. If the CRP becomes abnormal after having a normal baseline, the clinician should consider the possibility that an infection or a clozapine-induced inflammation is present. Both can be associated with \u2193 clozapine metabolism; it is better to hold clozapine dose increases until CRP becomes normal. d Fluvoxamine should be stopped before starting clozapine since it is an extremely powerful inhibitor and studies provide a dose-correction factor of 0.10-0.20. Oral contraceptives [58] or high intake of caffeine [59] may require a dose correction factor of 0.5. Valproic acid has been consistently associated with myocarditis because at the beginning it can definitively behave as an inhibitor of clozapine metabolism. If there is no possibility of discontinuing oral contraceptives or valproic acid, we recommend \u2193 the titration dose in half and use a target dose for maintenance, which is half the dose required for the patient's ethnicity, sex and smoking status (see Supplementary Table S1 ). e When possible during titration, orthostatic changes in blood pressure and pulse need to be measured. Orthostatic abnormalities or other ADRs should signal the need for a slower titration. Fever should prompt stopping titration and drawing CRP levels and waiting until they normalize to proceed with titration. f Avoid major dose \u2191 during weekends or times with less nursing supervision. g For an Asian patient with a dose=150 mg/day for 1 week, you measure clozapine concentration in the early morning before meds. Two examples are: a) the concentration=350 ng/ml; this provides a C/D ratio=350/150=2.4 and suggests the patient only needs a dose around 150 mg/day, or b) concentration =175 ng/ml; this provides a C/D ratio =175/150=1.2 and suggests the patient needs a dose \u2265300 mg/day to reach a clozapine concentration = 350 ng/ml. h For a US patient with dose =300 mg/day for 1 week, you measure clozapine concentration in the early morning before meds. Two examples are: a) the concentration =350 ng/ml; this provides a C/D ratio =350/300=1.2 and suggests the patient only needs a dose around 300 mg/day, or b) concentration =175 ng/ml; this provides a C/D ratio =175/300=0.6 and suggests the patient needs a dose \u2265600 mg/day to reach a clozapine concentration = 350 ng/ml. Until prospective studies are available, we recommend caution with increases or decreases of daily caffeine intake of > 1 cup of coffee (or 2 cans of caffeinated soda) in non-smokers and > 3 cups of coffee (or 6 cans of caffeinated soda) in smokers. For example, when a smoker taking clozapine increases caffeine intake by 3 cups of coffee (e.g., from 2 to 5 cups per day), clinicians should watch for increased side effects due to \u2191 clozapine C [5]. 1994, Jerling et al. [76] demonstrated that an inducer decreases CLO C/D ratio while an inhibitor increases it. When comparing individuals, a very low CLO C/D ratio indicates a UM (assuming compliance) while a very high C/D ratio indicates a CLO PM. As CLO follows linear kinetics, the CLO C/D ratio is a constant in an individual unless something changes the clearance, such as the addition of an inducer or inhibitor. \u2022 Total CLO C/D ratio is calculated by dividing the total C (CLO C + NORC C) by the CLO D and is a better measure of the clearance than the CLO C/D ratio. CLO has antipsychotic efficacy, while NCLO does not. The total CLO C/D ratio may be better than the CLO C/D ratio as a measure of predicting the ADR risk [68] . ADRs, adverse drug reactions; C, concentration; C/D, concentration-to-dose; CLO, clozapine; D, dose; NCLO, norclozapine; PM, poor metabolizer; TDM, therapeutic drug monitoring; UM, ultrarapid metabolizer a In patients taking their only dose at night, the trough C will be at night before the D but it is not practical to measure at that time; thus, it is reasonable to measure C early in the morning and still consider it a trough C. b Once steady state has been reached there is equilibrium between the drug's absorption and elimination. c The AGNP therapeutic range is based on 7 studies [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . Most of them did not describe the administration pattern. A carefully designed inpatient trial [82] with administration over 2-3 days reported efficacy of the 200-300 ng/ml dose and the 350-450 ng/ml dose, with no advantage for 350-450 ng/ml over 200-300 ng/ml. Thus, in inpatients with the daily dose divided into 2-3 administrations/day, it is possible that lower Cs (200-300 ng/ml) may be enough. ",

Recommendations regarding pneumonia in clozapine patients [162] 1. Prevention \u2022 Education. The clozapine prescriber should educate his/her outpatients and families to be attentive to signs or symptoms of infection/inflammation or fever and to contact them immediately to prevent clozapine intoxication. \u2022 Measuring baseline clozapine TDM and clozapine C/D ratio. After reaching a stable maintenance clozapine D, the prescriber may measure two or three trough serum Cs and calculate their clozapine C/D ratios at steady state. By calculating the mean of the baseline clozapine C/D ratios, the clinician can establish a baseline for clozapine metabolism in that patient and the lowest clozapine D, providing a therapeutic serum C. In the unfortunate event that the patient develops pneumonia, this baseline clozapine C/D ratio can be compared with the decreased clozapine C/D ratio during the pneumonia. \u2022 Decrease risk of sedation and/or hypersalivation. Clozapine administration should be moved to the most convenient times in order to increase adherence and decrease these ADRs. Hypersalivation should be treated with non-pharmacological interventions, and preferably with local antimuscarinic treatments which may have less risk of increasing the risk of constipation than oral anticholinergic drugs, such as benztropine, or biperiden [170, 171] . Discontinuation of other co-medications associated with sedation should be considered. As benzodiazepines are associated with sedation, swallowing disturbances and pneumonia, clinicians may need to consider \u2193 or discontinuing them to \u2193 the risk of aspiration pneumonia. \u2022 Pneumonia vaccines. Although there are no studies, it may be reasonable to give pneumonia vaccines to clozapine patients to \u2193 risk of pneumonia not associated with aspiration, but the vaccines may not be as effective due to clozapine effects on immunological mechanisms. 2. During the infection \u2022 CRP and clozapine TDM. Once an infection has developed, the prescriber should order a CRP level immediately. If possible, a trough clozapine TDM should be measured. \u2022 Monitoring for clozapine intoxication and considering halving the clozapine D. When fever and/or CRP elevations develop, the prescriber should consider immediately halving the clozapine D and monitor for signs of clozapine intoxication. \u2022 When access to baseline clozapine TDM and TDM during pneumonia is available. A D correction factor can be calculated by dividing the baseline clozapine C/D ratio by the clozapine C/D ratio during pneumonia. In our study of infections [65], in \u00bc of patients it is better to use a D correction factor of 1/3 (\u2193 D to 1/3) to maintain the same clozapine Cs as before the pneumonia. \u2022 Signs of clozapine intoxication. If signs of clozapine intoxication are already present, it may be safer to stop clozapine for 2-3 days or until the clozapine TDM report arrives. The decision to discontinue clozapine needs to be individualized and include careful consideration of risk and benefits. Different countries have different rules about restarting clozapine after discontinuation that need to be considered regarding the decision to discontinue clozapine completely or maintain a very low D (25 mg/day). \u2022 Antibiotics. Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin) should not be used.",

Moving from a half D during infection to a baseline clozapine D after infection may be possible with little or no uptitration (these Ds provide roughly the same Cs). \u2022 If the clinician did not measure a baseline clozapine C/D ratio before the infection, it may be wise to obtain clozapine C/D ratios for several weeks after the infection to establish the lowest clozapine D providing therapeutic serum C and efficacy for maintenance treatment with the fewest ADRs in order to avoid the recurrence of pneumonia in the future. o The first sign that the titration is too fast for that patient is usually a skin rash. o Uptitration continues and auto-antibodies and Stevens-Johnson syndrome develop [177] . \u2022 Peculiar ADR.

[26] described 23 clozapine myocarditis from the Australia drug agency. 2000s \u2022 2000: Dejeveran et al.

Sex. \u2642 tend to have 0.84 of the \u2640 C/D ratio [45]. Estrogens inhibit clozapine metabolism. \u2022 Smoking. Smokers tend to have 0.81 of the non-smokers' C/D ratio [45]. Tobacco smoke has PAHs which induce CYP1A2. Smoking 1 pack/day may lead to maximum induction [52]. 2. Effects of Asian ethnicity on clozapine C/D ratios \u2022 US.

Do not use in the absence of TDM [55]. \u2022 Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin should not be prescribed; they are powerful CYP1A2 inhibitors. \u2022 Oral contraceptives: \u2193 to 1/2 of the prior D to keep the same C [58]. \u2022 Caffeine. b A high amount of caffeine can behave as a competitive inhibitor [59]. \u2022 Other SSRIs. Paroxetine and fluoxetine can be ignored in most patients [55]. Sertraline in high Ds can occasionally cause \u2191 clozapine Cs [60]. \u2022 TCAs have the potential to be competitive inhibitors [55]. \u2022 Perphenazine in high Ds [61] and flupenthixol may also inhibit clozapine metabolism [62]. \u2022 Valproic acid in some patients inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, the parent compound [57]. 6. Renal excretion \u2022 Gemfibrozil inhibited norclozapine clearance by inhibiting a renal transporter [63]. \u2022 Geriatric age is associated with \u2193 clozapine clearance [64] by \u2193 norclozapine renal elimination. 7. Obesity \u2022 Using a model in a US RCT, weight gain may become clinically relevant in extreme obesity [44]. The PM status of 4 Asians (0.7% of 586) was explained by obesity [46]. 8. Inflammation \u2022 In 131 Chinese inpatients with 18 episodes of infection in 16 patients which contaminated 2% of days (482/24,789), we found: 1) no clinically relevant effects in the 11% of infection episodes which presented with no leukocytosis or \u2191 CRP, 2) \u2193 D to 1/2 would be advisable in 61% of the infection episodes, and 3) \u2193 D to 1/3 would be advisable in 28% of infection episodes [65]. \u2022 Clozapine-induced inflammation can happen during titration and can manifest as CRP elevations, fever and/or myocarditis, but other rarer forms have been described [66]. 10.

Single-dose studies provide short half-lives and suggest dosing twice a day [70]. CLO is lipophilic [71,72]. In repeated Ds, CLO deposits in fat tissue providing longer half-lives [73]: 17-34 hours in 3 patients [74]. This may explain why CLO can be administered once a day. \u2022 Trough. Serum Cs vary during the day and standardized Cs are measured when at their lowest value or valley (trough Cs) before the next CLO D.

On the other hand, TDM articles usually simplify the guideline by proposing that 5 half-lives are required before reaching steady state. A clinician needs to remember to wait at least 5 days from a CLO C change to order CLO TDM, but it is better to wait at least a week. 2. C/D ratio \u2022 Serum CLO and NORC Cs are usually measured by laboratories in ng/ml.

This CLO alert C has not been well studied. In the absence of clozapine ADRs, it is reasonable to repeat the CLO TDM when it is > 1000 ng/ml and consider \u2193 the D [69]. \u2022 The total C (CLO C + NCLO C) may better reflect what are usually called D-related ADRs such as seizures, hypersalivation and constipation.

Better profile related to causing EPS \u2022 In 1987, Van Putten and Marder [130] described the behavioral toxicity of antipsychotics with: o akinesia associated with a subjective sense of sedation and excessive sleeping o akathisia strongly associated with depression and dysphoric responses. \u2022 This has been ignored until recently [131, 132]. \u2022 In a 2013 meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotics compared with placebo [133]: o clozapine was the only one with an OR lower than 1: OR=0.3, (CI 0.12 to 0.62) \u2022 Clozapine can cause EPS; its beneficial effects tend to be greater than its negative effects [134]. \u2022 Antipsychotics cause more EPS as their dose is \u2191; it does not happen with clozapine [135]. \u2022 Clozapine produces little akathisia [136] and frequently is beneficial for patients with chronic akathisia [137] who usually report major improvements in well-being. \u2022 Clozapine rarely causes TD [138], but is a good treatment for TD according to recent systematic reviews [139, 140] and for tardive dystonia [141].

Clozapine-induced myocarditis and rapid titration 1. Critical review of the literature on the role of rapid titrations (Supplementary Box S1) \u2022 1980: first clozapine-induced myocarditis: rapid titration in a patient during an overdose[16].\u2022 1995: the first case with no overdose was published [21]: the first rapid titration by a doctor. \u2022 2000: Dejeveran et al. [27] commented that the Australian review by Killian et al. [26] that brought attention to clozapine-induced myocarditis neglected to comment that all these Australian cases were associated with rapid titration. \u2022 2007: Australian experts writing a clozapine guideline ignored the observation of one of them, Petridis, that myocarditis was associated with rapid titration [33]. \u2022 2012: Ronaldson et al. [36], in an Australian case-control study, described rapid titration and coprescription with valproic acid as risk factors for clozapine-induced myocarditis. 2. Ignoring clozapine PMs makes normal titration too rapid for specific patients \u2022 CLO PMs need to be identified within two major genetic groups [48, 180]: a o Asians (ancestral origins ranging from Pakistan to Japan) and possibly Native Americans [48] o Non-Asians: Caucasians and people of African ancestry \u2022 Also consider the effects of sex and smoking [45, 46]. \u2022 In the phenomenon of phenoconversion, normal metabolizers can become PMs due to [54]: o co-prescription of inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, oral contraceptives or valproic acid o obesity o undiagnosed inflammation \u2022 Some clozapine PMs appear NOT to suffer from phenoconversion (possibly genetic PMs): o Asians: around 7% (range 3.8-12.9%) [69] o European Caucasians: <3% [45]. 3. Recently published data supporting this model \u2022 In the US: 5 cases of clozapine-induced myocarditis were reinterpreted by us due to [50]: o 4 with rapid titration o 1 possibly genetic PM who could not tolerate a clozapine dose of 25 mg/day \u2022 In Australia and possibly Canada [181, 182] a 3% incidence may be explained by: o using Caucasian-level titration in Asians or o using normal titration in non-Asian patients who are taking valproic acid. \u2022 Oral contraceptives (inhibitors) b lead to high risk of clozapine-induced inflammation [58]. 4. Recommendations for starting clozapine in patients on valproic acid \u2022 Published data: o Valproic acid is a frequent medication in many patients started on clozapine. This is not surprising since it is used for epilepsy and aggressive behaviors. o Valproic acid is a risk factor for clozapine-induced myocarditis in articles from Australia [36], Canada [181], the US [183, 184], Turkey [185], Poland [186] and Japan [187]. \u2022 Experience of the first author:o In the hospital of the first author, there have been 4 cases of clozapine-induced myocarditis since 2002. One of them appeared to be a genetic PM and the other 3 were on valproic acid. In 2 of them TDM suggested that they behave as clozapine PMs. In summary, for some of the patients valproic acid appears to be an inhibitor. o In some other patients, valproic acid appears to be an inducer[87].\u2022 Current clozapine titration recommendation for patients on valproic acid: o Avoid using it if possible o If needed, use extremely slow clozapine titration to avoid myocarditis. o Use clozapine TDM in case valproic acid serves as an inducer.",

A barrier somewhat specific to the US, where there is great fear of litigation.Many psychiatrists such as those in the first author's state expect clozapine to be initiated in a hospital and do not want to risk outpatient initiation as is the norm in other countries. According to a survey among clinicians in the UK, inpatient initiation is the third most important barrier after concerns over blood monitoring and ADRs [222] . [240] reported that, when using DBS, N-clozapine-oxide reverts to clozapine. o Future studies will need to establish whether or not: 1) DBS provides reliable results for personalizing clozapine dosing by using clozapine C/D ratios and 2) it can be widely used across different countries at a relatively affordable cost. \u2022 In other Western countries, clozapine is also approved for TRS [148] , but the indications in Asian countries vary substantially [242] . \u2022 In the US, clozapine was also approved for suicide risk in schizophrenia in 2002 [29] .",
