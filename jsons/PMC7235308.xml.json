To avoid the risk of emergency intubation in the EVT angiography suite with potential viral spread, it is appropriate to make early decisions regarding the need for intubation. If needed, it should be done in an elective, controlled manner prior to transfer to the angiography suite in a negative pressure room. This does not imply the need to intubate more patients, and we continue to recommend that monitored anaesthesia is preferred unless there is a clinical indication for intubation.5 Similarly, recent multisociety guidance agrees that intubation is not necessary for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.11,12 The minimum possible sedation should be used in COVID-19 suspected patients, to reduce the risk that bag-mask ventilation, an aerosol-generating procedure, would be required.11\n",

As recommended by ethicists, decisions on triage should be based on objective evidence for mortality risk without making presumptions about quality of life for stroke survivors.13 Triage for ICU admission should be made only after attempting emergency procedures to reverse the patient\u2019s condition, including intravenous thrombolysis and EVT for acute ischemic stroke and treatment of hydrocephalus in hemorrhagic stroke patients.",

Patients with a dual diagnosis of acute stroke and COVID-19 may be admitted to a nonstroke unit with HCP less experienced at providing stroke care and early rehabilitation.5 In these instances, there should be processes in place for consultation with stroke experts and education on stroke best practices.14 Particularly important is education for the recognition, assessment, and management of dysphagia, aphasia, cognitive impairment, handling and positioning of hemiplegic extremities, venous thromboembolism prevention, transfers, and fall prevention. All interdisciplinary staff should also receive basic stroke education on assessment for signs and symptoms of stroke as part of monitoring for possible stroke transformation. This should include screening tools such as FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time)15 and protocols for in-hospital actions to be taken if signs and symptoms of stroke are identified.
