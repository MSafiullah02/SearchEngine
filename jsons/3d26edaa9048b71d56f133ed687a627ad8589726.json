Using an edge-based compartmental approach and percolation tools, we find that a time-dependent quantity \u03a6 S (t), namely, the probability that a given neighbor of a node is susceptible at time t, is the control parameter of a node void percolation process involving those nodes on the network not-reached by the disease. We show that there exists a critical time t c above which the giant susceptible component is destroyed. As a consequence, in order to preserve a macroscopic connected fraction of the network composed by healthy individuals which guarantee its functionality, any mitigation strategy should be implemented before this critical time t c . Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive simulations of the SIR process. * Electronic address: ldvaldes[at]mdp.edu.ar T c = 1/ k .

Recent outbreaks of new influenza strains like the H1N1 [1] and the H5N5 flu or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2] , which are characterized by a high rate of mortality and/or fast propagation velocity, motivate the development of epidemic models that capture the main features of the spread of those diseases.

In the SIR model the individuals can be in one of three states, susceptible, infected or recovered. In its discrete formulation [5] [6] [7] , at each time step, infected individuals infect their susceptible neighbors with probability \u03b2 and recover at a fixed time t r since they were infected, called recovery time. According to these rules, the disease spreads on the contact network until it reaches the steady state where there are only susceptible and recovered individuals. It was found that the steady state of the SIR model can be mapped into a link percolation problem which provides a theoretical framework to study this process [6, [8] [9] [10] . It is known that the size of the infection, defined as the fraction of recovered individuals at the steady state, is governed by the effective probability of infection or transmissibility T of the disease which depends on \u03b2 and t r . In the SIR model, the size of the infection is the order parameter of a second order phase transition with a critical threshold transmissibility T c . Below T c the disease is an outbreak, where the infection reaches a small fraction of the population while above T c an epidemic develops exactly as in a link percolation process [6, [8] [9] [10] .",

From an epidemiological point of view, this implies that if a disease spreads for a second time on the residual network, it cannot become an epidemic. On the other hand, Valdez et al. [13] showed that T * is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy, because any strategy that decrease the transmissibility below T * , can protect a large and connected cluster of susceptible individuals. Using a percolation framework, they explained the lost of the susceptible giant cluster as a not-random node percolation process, that they called node void percolation, in which a susceptible individual corresponds to a void node in link percolation.",

            "text": "Even though percolation theory was very useful to describe the steady state of the SIR model on complex networks, it is still very challenging to explain the dynamics of the model to develop intervention strategies before the epidemic spreads to a large fraction of the population. To describe the dynamics of epidemic spreading on networks, recently some researchers developed differential rate equations for the SIR model that take into account the network topology. Lindquist et al. [14] introduced an \"effective degree\" approach through a large system of ordinary differential equations. Under this approach, the nodes and their neighbors are categorized by their disease state (susceptible, infected, recovered) and each differential equation compute the evolution of the fraction of susceptible or infected nodes with a number i and s of infected and susceptible neighbors, respectively, with 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k max and 0 \u2264 s \u2264 k max . As a result, a system with O (k 2 max ) equations needs to be solved. This approach represents accurately the evolution of the number of infected individuals, but at a high computational cost. On the other hand, Miller [15] and Miller et al. [16, 17] proposed an ingenious approach to describe the evolution of a SIR process with rates by means of an edge-based compartmental model (EBCM) [15, 16] which has the advantage to describe the dynamical spreading of an epidemic with only a few equations. With these equations, the authors found accurate results for the evolution of the number of infected individuals for static and dynamic evolutive topologies like \"edge swapping\" and \"dormant contacts\" for transmissibilities above the critical threshold [16] .",

Finally the evolution of the fraction of infected individuals is given by In node void percolation, as a link is traversed, void node is removed. The void nodes are removed with probability proportional to kP (k). As the susceptible nodes can be mapped into void node percolation, the susceptible network loses their higher degree nodes first as in an intentional attack. As a consequence, the resulting susceptible network is more homogeneous than the original. Thus, mean field exponents of a second order percolating phase transition [23] are expected. In order to show the effect of the disease spreading on the highest degree nodes, in Fig. S2 we plot for a SF network the effective degree distribution of the susceptible nodes obtained from the simulations, in which a susceptible node has degree k when it has k susceptible neighbors. As shown in Fig. S2 , as the disease spreads, the effective degree distribution loses the heavy tail. As a result of this process, the susceptible clusters becomes more sparse and at the critical time t c the topology of the susceptible clusters change drastically since the susceptible individuals lose all the hubs and P (k) has an exponential tail. For percolation in mean field it is known that at the criticality the finite cluster size distribution n S \u223c s \u2212\u03c4 with \u03c4 = 2.5 and Fig. S3 we plot the simulations results of the finite size distribution of the susceptible nodes n s at t = t c . We can see that at t c , n s (t c ) behaves as a power law with exponent \u03c4 \u2248 2.5 which corresponds to the mean field value, independently of the initial degree distribution of the network [24] . Similarly, in Fig. S4 we plot S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t) obtained from the simulations and the theoretical approach. We compute \u03a6 S (t) from the simulations as the square root of the fraction of edges connecting two susceptible nodes [25] . We can see that S 1 (t) behaves as a power law with exponent one with the distance to the criticality \u03a6 s (t c ), which also corresponds to the mean field value (see Insets of Fig. S4 ). Since two critical exponents are sufficient to determine the universality class, the results showed above indicate that in a node void percolation process the susceptible network belongs to the same universality class of mean field percolation and confirms quantitatively the homogenization of the susceptible network during a SIR epidemic spreading.",

In turn, when the transmissibility T reaches T * from above, the critical time t c grows very fast. This phenomenon is analogous to other second order phase transitions in physics like the relaxation time near the Curie temperature, which are called \"critical slowing down\" [26, 27] , and indicates that that once the transmissibility increases slightly above T * , the time needed to destroy the giant susceptible cluster decreases very fast.

In order to show the equivalence, inFig. 1we show in the same plot S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t), obtained from Eqs.(3)-(2)and(12)-(13), and the steady state S 1 (t \u2192 \u221e) as a function of V s[12] for ER and SF networks with the same k and N for T = 0.76 > T * . Equivalence between \u03a6 S (t) and V s . S 1 (t \u2192 \u221e) as a function of V s (\u00d7) obtained in Refs.[12,13] and S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t) (solid line) obtained from Eqs. (3)-(2)and(12)-(13) with N = 10 5 and mean connectivity 4.07 in the giant component for (A) a ER network with k = 4 and (B) SF network with \u03bb = 2.63, k min = 2 and k = 4.07. In the insets we show S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t) from the simulations (symbols) and from Eqs. (3)-(2) and (12)-(13) (solid line) for t r = 1 ( ) and t r = 20 ( ). (Color online).As we can see, the static curve S 1 (t \u2192 \u221e) as a function of V s is the same as S 1 (t) as a function of \u03a6 S (t) and they coincide with the simulations for different values of t r which shows the equivalence between V s and \u03a6 S (t) at every instant of time and not only at the steady state (for details of the simulations see Appendix Sec.I). Thus our process can be explained by a dynamic percolation with an instantaneous void transmissibility",

            "text": "All our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the simulations. Our findings are very interesting from an epidemiological point of view since the existence of a threshold time implies that when a very virulent disease reaches a small number of susceptible individuals, the authorities have only a limited time to intervene, in order to protect a big community (susceptible giant component) that has not been already reached by the epidemic, and to preserve the topological features of SF networks. Our finding on the susceptible network could be extended to other epidemics dynamics allowing to obtain a better description of the effect of diseases spreading on social and technological networks.III.

We select only the runs in which the size of the epidemic has reached a macroscopic fraction of individuals in the steady state[5,6,9] because the deterministic equations are only valid for epidemics above the critical threshold T c . We performed all the simulations using synchronized or simultaneous updates at each time step.InFig. S1, we plot the time evolution of the fraction of infected nodes I(t) for ER and SF networks obtaining by the EBCM approach Eqs. (S6-S9) and the simulation.For the simulations we shifted t = 0 to the instant when the disease has reached 1% of the individuals. We choose this reference time, as the time when the disease has reached a size enough to growth deterministically. This choice compensates the time dispersion of each trial around the theoretical solution due to stochastic effects at the early stages of the process when the number of infected nodes is small [16] (see the insets of Fig. S1). As shown in Figs. S1A-B, each trial simulation has the same shape as the theoretical solution which shows that the EBCM approach and the simulations are in excellent agreement. FIG.
