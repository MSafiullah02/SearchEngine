A comparison between the different viral identification methods is presented in Table 7 .1. The efficacy of sampling methodologies for viruses in environmental samples is still a matter of intense debate. A meta-analysis study performed with the aim to assess the efficacy of virus concentration methods associated to the molecular detection of adenovirus demonstrated that for detection in environmental samples qPCR or Nested-PCR should be prioritized over PCR; in water samples (e.g. rivers or lakes) ultracentrifugation should be associated with nested-PCR and that microfiltration membrane, ultrafiltration, and qPCR must be associated for assessment of treated and untreated sewage samples (Silva and Melo, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1008, "end": 1030, "text": "(Silva and Melo, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 399, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Contamination Assessments in Environmental Samples"}, {"text": "It is currently acknowledged that viral contamination of recreational water presents a high risk of infection and is considered a significant public health hazard.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Contamination in Water"}, {"text": "Published studies, summarized in Table 7 .2, have addressed the assessment of virus bioburden in water environmental samples. The most commonly found viruses in aquatics environments are enteric viruses, such as Enterovirus, Rotavirus and Norovirus, Adenovirus and Hepatitis Virus A and C. Begier and coworkers have correlated swimming in polluted seawater with enterovirus infection (Begier et al., 2008) . For enteroviruses, the most common mode of transmission is the fecal-oral route, although aerosol transmission has also been reported. In a similar manner, drinking water contaminated with virus, such as Norovirus, also presents a risk for human health, highlighting the importance of good hygiene practices with respect to water storage, Shin and Sobsey suggested that water chlorination could inactivate enteric viruses (Shin & Sobsey, 2008) . Sample concentration is a critical step in viral diagnosis, since the number of viral particles in water is generally very low, which often results in false results if samples are tested directly using PCR (Katayama et al., 2002) . Therefore, some authors choose an adsorption-elution method, followed by ultrafiltration, to concentrate the viruses, before nested-PCR or quantitative Real Time PCR. In severally contaminated environments such as hospital wastewater treatment plants, Prado and coworkers utilized PCR/RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and genome sequencing, after sample concentrations techniques, to assess the presence of viruses associated with human pathologies such as acute gastroenteritis and (Prado et al., 2011) . In intermediate contaminated environments, such as urban and bathing waters the assessment of microbial hazards with potential public health risk associated with viral contamination also preferentially utilizes nucleic acid amplification methodologies, after sample concentration. Some authors chose to utilize the combination of culture dependent and independent methodologies for virus identification from environmental samples. In a study performed by Roberto A. Rodr\u00edguez and coworkers that aimed to assess the effects of sewer overflows to the viral contamination of receiving waters, concentrated samples were assayed for total culturable viruses using the PLC/PRF/5 cell line with associated confirmation by PCR/RT-PCR (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 405, "text": "(Begier et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 830, "end": 851, "text": "(Shin & Sobsey, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1083, "text": "(Katayama et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1347, "text": "Prado and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1598, "text": "(Prado et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2327, "end": 2351, "text": "(Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 33, "end": 40, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Contamination in Water"}, {"text": "Viruses can be transmitted directly from individual to individual via sneezing, coughing and touching, or indirectly via the environment. The prevalence of pathogenic viruses in healthcare settings potentially transmitted by airborne, droplet and contact represents a significant threat for both workers' and patients' health. Thus, most of the presently performed studies regarding virus contamination of surfaces have focused on clinical settings, as demonstrated in Table 7 .3. The data resultant from these studies is of foremost importance since it can allow the identification of critical locations and direct the selection of infection control measures for health-care settings to decrease viral associated nosocomial infections. Protocols regarding transmission based precautions in both hospital personnel and patients are continuously updated at the international level (La Rosa et al., 2013) . et al., 2014) in aerosol samples trough filtration method combined with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique (Tseng et al., 2010) .

Nevertheless, culture-dependent methods and nucleic acid amplification techniques can also be used simultaneously. As an example, a study performed by Goyal and coworkers utilized embryonated eggs and tissue cultures of Vero, MDCK, and RK-13 cell lines combined with nucleic acid extraction, PCR, RT-PCR and Nucleic acid sequencing to assess contamination of respiratory viruses (VSR, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, Rinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus, Filoviruses, Adenovirus and Orthopoxvirus) and viruses with bioterrorism potential in ventilation filters from two large public buildings (Goyal et al., 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 884, "end": 902, "text": "Rosa et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 905, "end": 918, "text": "et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1063, "text": "(Tseng et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1283, "text": "(Carducci et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1356, "text": "(D'Arcy et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1984, "text": "(Goyal et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 476, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Contamination on Surfaces"}, {"text": "The assessment of viral contamination and/or infections play a key role in reducing global viral disease associated burden.

in environmental water samples Airborne diseases are caused by pathogens transmitted through the air, that may be spread through coughing, sneezing, resuspension of dust, spraying of liquids, or similar activities likely to generate aerosol particles or droplets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that aerosol exposure may be the major route for spreading viral diseases (World Health Organization, 2010). Environmental monitoring of airborne viruses could provide an early indicator of dangerous viruses in the air. Filtration methods that may utilize gelatin membrane filters, impaction collectors and impingers are usually used to collect viral aerosols. Sampling using air filters for several hours with posterior extraction and nucleic acid amplification can increase the sensitivity of virus detection. Currently, well-established filter/real-time qPCR assays are performed to successfully measure viral aerosols. The prevalence of respiratory tract infections is intrinsically associated with respiratory viruses which account for high percentage of pediatric as well as adult infections.
