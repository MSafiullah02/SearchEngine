The vaccine against Hib, responsible for nearly eliminating Hib meningitis from infants and young children [1], [5] is an example of a conjugate vaccine. DNA vaccines, which contain a gene or genes encoding a particular antigen(s), have so far only been licensed for veterinary use. They have, however, shown promise as vaccines against a wide variety of diseases including tuberculosis [6], [7], SARS [8], [9], [10] and HIV-1 [11], [12]. Subunit vaccines use a portion of the pathogen such as an individual protein as the antigen. These vaccines are attractive because of their increased safety since they cannot revert to a virulent form and their lack of contaminants remaining from the original pathogenic organism. Additionally, the ability to consistently produce large, well defined quantities of antigen from recombinant methods is highly desirable [1], [13].",

In many cases, the antigen itself is only very weakly immunogenic; therefore, an adjuvant is needed to intensify the immune response. Adjuvants can also be included in vaccines to guide the type of immune response generated [14], [15]. This may be especially important when developing vaccines for cancer [16], HIV [17] or mucosal immunizations [18]. In contrast, a more immunogenic antigen may benefit from a specific delivery vehicle [14]. This component may facilitate targeting and/or controlled release of the antigen to antigen presenting cells. Recent studies utilizing Toll-like receptor ligands have shown that antigens associated with these ligands can produce exceptionally high antibody titers and rapid immune responses [19]. Adjuvants and delivery vehicles have also been shown to protect antigens from degradation, although this generally depends on the nature of adjuvant. For example, while chitosan\u2013alginate nanoparticles were found to stabilize ovalbumin [20], other studies have shown that model protein antigens are actually destabilized by traditional aluminum salt adjuvants [21], [22].",

Despite their frequent, global use for many decades, the mode of action of aluminum salt adjuvants is not well understood. At least three potential mechanisms are frequently described in the literature [25], [26].

Because particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm are more easily phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells [29], [30], uptake of the antigen adsorbed to a particulate adjuvant should be increased (relative to antigen in solution) thereby improving the efficiency of antigen recognition and presentation. The third suggested mechanism of action is by a direct stimulation of the immune system through enhanced cytokine production. More specifically, aluminum salt adjuvants are known to primarily stimulate a humoral response by increasing production of Th2 cytokines [24]. While enhancement of Th2 cytokine production may be favorable for the treatment of some extracellular infections, a cellular immune response may be preferred for immunization against other disease states (e.g., HIV, malaria, cancer, etc.). A fourth mechanism of action was recently proposed after studies revealed a destabilization of proteins adsorbed to aluminum salt adjuvants: the structural perturbations that occur upon adsorption may, in fact, increase the antigen's susceptibility to proteolytic processing by the immune system, leading to enhanced antigen presentation [21].",

Such a procedure involves priming the immune system with one vectored vaccine (often a DNA vector) and boosting with the same pathogen's genetic material in another type of vector or a recombinant protein. While this approach has been successful for HIV vaccines in monkeys, it has not worked well in humans for HIV immunization [61], [62], [63] until recently. A clinical study published last year demonstrated that a prime-boost regimen HIV vaccine employing DNA and MVA resulted in \u201cmultifunctional HIV-1-specific T cells capable of rapid proliferation in eight out of eight vaccine recipients\u201d [47], [64]. A malaria vaccine administered using this dosing regimen also showed promise in the clinic [48], [50]. Preclinical trials of viral-vectored vaccines used to immunize against tuberculosis [65], Ebola [66] and SIV [67] using a prime-boost strategy also appear promising.",

The strong immunogenicity enhancement of MF59 is clearly seen in preclinical data published by Ott et al. [87]. They reported that guinea pigs showed a 34-fold increase in antibody titers when immunized with glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 in the presence of MF59 compared to aluminum hydroxide, while goat and baboon showed 9- and 5-fold increases, respectively [87].

The matrix that is formed traps the protein antigens (typically hydrophobic membrane proteins) through apolar interactions [23], [99], [102], [103]. A similar vaccine delivery vehicle and adjuvant has also been developed that uses the same material minus the antigen and is referred to as ISCOMATRIX\u00ae [104]. The antigen can be added later to the ISCOMATRIX\u00ae during formulation of the vaccine. This material seems to work similarly to ISCOMs, but provides for more general applications by removing the requirement for hydrophobic antigens [104].",

Additional ISCOM/ISCOMATRIX\u00ae vaccines have been in the clinic for HIV [102], HSV [102], HPV [100], [107], HCV [100], [108] and cancer (utilizing NY-ESO-1 as the antigen) [109]. In all cases, the studies have shown a good safety and tolerability profile in humans [106], [107], [110], [111] as well as induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses [100], [106], [111]. Despite these successes, the actual use of ISCOMs in human vaccines has been deterred by concerns regarding safety since some saponins are toxic at elevated levels [102]. Nevertheless, certain saponins, such as Quil A and QS-21 have not shown major signs of toxicity in humans at the doses administered [102], [106], [111].",

Oral administration of ISCOM vaccines has also been shown to be effective, but this route requires the use of high and frequent dosing [104], [114]. A study in sheep also indicated that ISCOM vaccines may be able to elicit strong mucosal immune responses when administered in the pelvic presacral space, which could be useful for immunization against viral infections of the female genital tract [115].",

Not to be confused with the calcium phosphate gel adjuvant used in the European diphtheria\u2013pertussis\u2013tetanus (DPT) vaccine formulations [130], [131], calcium phosphate nanoparticles are less than ~ 1.2 \u03bcm (< 1000 nm according to He et al., 2000) in diameter [127], [128]. BioSante Pharmaceuticals has been developing this \u201cCaP\u201d technology. A phase I study in healthy volunteers showed that CaP was safe and non-toxic when administered subcutaneously [132]. Preclinical studies indicated that vaccines containing CaP resulted in immune responses similar to or greater than those adjuvanted with aluminum salts, and the duration of the response was longer [128], [133]. Additionally, CaP has shown promise as a mucosal adjuvant. Studies in mice utilizing an HSV-2 antigen suggest that CaP administered IN or intravaginally can elicit protective systemic and mucosal immunity [127]. Vaccines utilizing CaP in preclinical studies include anthrax, HBV, flu (H5N1 avian and seasonal) and HSV-2 [127], [133].",

These biodegradable, biocompatible polymers have been approved for use in humans (e.g., as sutures, bone implants and screws as well as implants for sustained drug delivery) and have been extensively studied for use in the formulation of vaccine antigens (i.e., proteins, peptides, DNA, etc.) [134], [135], [136]. In these formulations, antigen can be either entrapped or adsorbed to the surface of the particles. Furthermore, these particles can be tailored to degrade over a range of rates [134]. They can therefore act as a depot from which the encapsulated antigen is gradually released [134]. Additionally, polymeric particles may offer protection to encapsulated antigens delivered orally and facilitate uptake by M-cells in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) when administered nasally, thus serving as a vehicle for mucosal immunization [134], [137], [138]. Adsorbed antigen, however, may offer improved stability and activity over encapsulated antigen by avoiding exposure to organic solvents used during formulation and acidic pH conditions caused by degradation of the polymer [139].",

Since these materials may remain in the tissues for extended periods of time, it is thought that the antigen may be presented to the immune system over similar time periods thereby enhancing immunogenicity. Gold particles have been frequently described for vaccine delivery both with and without the aid of electroporation, which has been shown to often dramatically enhance the potency of DNA vaccines by improving delivery into cellular interiors [142]. Combining electroporation with intradermal delivery of DNA and gold particles, an enhanced and accelerated immune response has been observed in mice [143]; however, electroporation may not be applicable in a human clinical setting due to cell mortality resulting from the high-voltage electrical pulses [144]. A study in humans using these particles without electroporation produced a relatively low response rate after vaccination with DNA-gold particle granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) transfected autologous tumor cells [145].",

Clinical trials have shown that this approach can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, making it one of the only consistently successful DNA vaccine delivery approaches currently available [146].

For this review, liposomes are considered to be composed of non-viral lipids (i.e., lipids not obtained passively from host cells in viral budding processes). For vaccine delivery, an antigen (or adjuvant) may be either encapsulated in the core of the liposome, buried within the lipid bilayer or adsorbed on the surface for presentation to antigen presenting cells [16], [150], [151]. These delivery vesicles are considered to be non-toxic when the phospholipids used in their preparation are found in mammalian cells, but the lipids themselves are relatively non-immunogenic. Thus, for vaccine purposes, these particles are considered most useful for delivering antigens and adjuvants [16].",

Nakanishi et al. demonstrated that cationic liposomes are much more potent than anionic or neutral liposomes for generating a cell-mediated immune response [152]. An interesting preclinical study in mice conducted by Guan et al. evaluated the effect of the liposome formulation on the type of immune response generated for a MUC1 therapeutic cancer vaccine. This study revealed that liposome-associated (either encapsulated or surface-exposed) MUC1 peptide (BP25) produced a strong specific CTL response; however, an antibody response was only observed for the surface-associated BP25 formulation [153]. Clinical studies have confirmed that L-BLP25 (also known as Stimuvax\u00ae, a lyophilized, liposomal formulation of BP25 lipopeptide, MPL\u00ae and three lipids [154]) is well-tolerated and elicits a cellular immune response in patients with lung cancer [155]. Stimuvax\u00ae is being developed by Merck and Biomira for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for ~ 80% of all lung cancers [156]. A phase IIB trial showed that the L-BLP25 vaccine increases survival rates for patients with smaller, nonmetastatic NSCLC tumors [154]. A phase III clinical trial is currently underway.",

The world's best selling vaccine, Prevnar, is an example of such a vaccine [169]. Prevnar is a pneumococcal vaccine manufactured by Wyeth consisting of the saccharides of the capsular antigens of seven serotypes of S. pneumoniae conjugated to mutant diphtheria toxoid CRM197\n[170]. Additionally, the conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae type B (Hib) were developed using Hib polysaccharide conjugated to either diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D), OMP of N. meningitidis (PRP-OMP), mutant diphtheria toxoid CRM197 (HbOC) or tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) to render the Hib antigen immunogenic [171]. The meningococcal vaccine is another example of a conjugate vaccine.

ISA 50V, 51 and 720 are water-in-oil emulsions while ISA 206 is a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion. ISA 206 and 50V have been used only in veterinary vaccine formulations while the other two are under investigation for use in humans [172]. Emulsions of Montanide\u2122 ISA 51 and 720 are composed of a metabolizable squalene-based oil with a mannide monooleate emulsifier [173], [174], [175]. The ISA 720 formulation is slightly different from that of ISA 51 and permits antigens to be released more rapidly [24]. Similar to Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) in physical character, the biodegradable nature of the Montanide\u2122 eliminates many of the cytotoxic properties of IFA [176]. The immune enhancement produced by the Montanide\u2122 emulsions is believed to be due to the formation of a depot at the site of injection [173].",

In these cases, a humoral response, which may be attainable with the use of aluminum salt adjuvants, may not be sufficient for generating protective immunity. Clinical studies of various nanoparticulate immunopotentiators and antigen delivery vehicles have shown CTL responses for viral vectors, ISCOMs and Montanide\u2122 ISA 51 and 720. Th1 responses have been elicited for MF59 and MPL\u00ae. Additionally, cellular immune responses have also been generated in humans using VLPs, virosomes, non-degradable nanoparticles and liposomes. The breadth of carriers that has shown this desirable response shows promise for the development of new and improved vaccines of a wide variety of types.",

Preclinical studies have also demonstrated mucosal immunity for IN administration of ISCOM and CaP vaccines as well as for intravaginal delivery of a CaP vaccine.",

The most probable reason is that the clinical trials required for vaccine approval are often very long and difficult. Unlike preclinical studies in which animals can be challenged with the infectious pathogen following immunization to evaluate whether the vaccine is protective, human trials often require waiting for an outbreak before protection can be analyzed. Furthermore, since many vaccines are often administered to healthy individuals, and frequently to infants, it is critical that they are proven safe and well-tolerated in non-human primates before entering human trials.",

            "text": "While the development of novel vaccine delivery systems and adjuvants has been aided by nanotechnology, this field has also resulted in some concerns regarding the toxicity of such small particles. Among perceived potential problems are their high surface area and reactivity, the ability of such small particles to cross biological membranes and the slow biodegradability of some materials [193], [194]. Such arguments are supported by data describing the effects of pollutants on human health [[138], [193]\u2013195]. Despite these issues, it seems reasonable to anticipate that in the case of vaccines, the infrequent and low-level exposure to nanoparticles that an individual will encounter during immunization is not enough to cause adverse health problems such as those potentially attributed to nanotoxicity effects. With that being said, the development of any novel vaccine adjuvant or delivery platform, like any other pharmaceutical product, must prove its safety and tolerability before its approval.",

Ideally, an adjuvant or delivery vehicle will have the ability to stimulate humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses concurrently or discretely, depending upon the desired treatment strategy. The duration of the response should be long and the vaccine components should be easily metabolized by the body. An additional challenge includes developing alternative, less invasive approaches for the administration of vaccinations. Perhaps most importantly, the cost of producing and distributing new vaccines should remain moderate such that the benefit is available to everyone at risk including persons in less developed parts of the world. As these challenges are met, the prevention and therapy of many previously untreatable diseases should become increasingly possible.",
