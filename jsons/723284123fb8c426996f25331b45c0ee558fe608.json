LETTER: W e have been reading with great interest the growing information regarding the catastrophic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has strongly affected almost every country across the globe, leading to >300,000 deaths. As such, Latin American countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, among others, are deeply impacted. In many Latin American countries, the government has mandated total quarantine to minimize virus exposure in the population in an attempt to flatten the epidemiologic curve of the disease. Health care workers are split into work groups to improve working conditions and to try to guarantee coverage of any necessary medical disease. In addition, substantial undocumented infection is enormously facilitating transmission, 1 and Latin American countries have limited resources for screening all asymptomatic patients.",

In fact, this motivated the AO Spine Latin America Trauma Study Group to conduct an ongoing survey in this region to evaluate the delay in the treatment of spine trauma requiring surgery: \"Surgical Delay in Thoracolumbar Fractures in Latin America. How Long Does It Take?\" The impact of timing on surgical intervention in spine trauma cases has been demonstrated in previous studies for cervical 2 and thoracolumbar 3 spine trauma. Notably, cases with incomplete deficit are generally more urgently treated compared with cases with complete spinal cord injury. 4 The impact of early surgery on the outcome of complete cervical traumatic spinal cord injury was demonstrated: to promote neurologic recovery, surgical decompression of the spinal cord within 24 hours seems particularly beneficial. 5 With regard to spine surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are some recommendations to perform emergency or confined surgery for patients with severe nerve root compression, spinal cord injury, progressive aggravation of nerve dysfunction, or spinal fracture with obvious displacement or compression. 6 However, many of these high-risk surgeries performed in high-risk patients require care in the intensive care unit, especially in cases in which a polytrauma needs to be properly managed. Many intensive care units are completely occupied or, when they are not, availability for patients who do not have COVID-19 is not considered a priority owing to the estimated projection of the virus spreading 7 based on information obtained from outside of Latin America and influenced by the beginning of the disease in a specific country.",

Patients with spine trauma are usually healthy, having unexpectedly sustained a significant injury of the spine, resulting in some cases in vertebral instability and/or new neurologic deficit, and in these patients social distancing is not possible. When these patients present with spine trauma, there is no knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 status, including in low-risk or asymptomatic patients, thereby impacting the final outcome if the patient treated has COVID-19, 8 and sometimes the surgery is already performed, having the potential to spread the infection to health care workers.",
