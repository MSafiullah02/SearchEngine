This deterioration was attributed to rapidly worsening ARDS. However, it is also important to identify that the high PEEP, which was originally applied to combat ARDS, could have led to increased intrathoracic pressure, ultimately leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output [11] . Furthermore, in pregnancy, despite hypervolemia, the effect of the gravid uterus on inferior vena cava can compromise venous return, which, in combination with a high PEEP, can precipitate hypotension [12] . And hence, the fact that after delivery, her hemodynamic parameters rapidly improved can be attributed to the reduction in oxygen consumption and effective deliverance of preload, thereby leading to an improvement in cardiac output, and ultimately, in gas exchange. While prone positioning has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe ARDS by means of improved lung recruitment, data regarding its utility in pregnancy is sparse [13, 14, 15] . Due to this reason, we decided against pronating the patient at the time of her rapid deterioration.",
