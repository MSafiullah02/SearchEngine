After detailed discussion with the patient and addressing his concerns, he was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated. This was followed by diagnostic bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collection and CT (computerized tomography) scan of chest which revealed bilateral diffuse ground glass opacity with extensive basal consolidation and pneumomediastinum (Fig. 2). Bedside trans-thoracic echocardiography showed good left ventricular function and non-dilated right ventricle.

As well patient had severe respiratory acidosis with PaCO2 of 109 mm Hg and pH 7.01; pulmonary compliance was only 9 ml/cm H2O and Murray score was 3. The decision was made to place the patient on V-V ECMO to facilitate lung protective ventilation, prevent progression of pneumomediastinum and improve respiratory acidosis. 25 French drainage cannula was inserted percutaneously into inferior vena cava via left femoral approach and 23 French return cannula was inserted into the inferior vena cava via right femoral approach under fluoroscopy guidance. Post cannulation, ECMO blood flow and sweep flow were titrated to 4 liters/min each in order to achieve optimal gas exchange. Mechanical ventilation was switched to ultra-protective strategy using Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) with Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) 15 cm H2O, PEEP 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate 10/min and FiO2 21 %. Patient was anticoagulated with intravenous heparin infusion targeting an APTT of 50-70 s. Cotrimoxazole 250 mg i.v. every 6 h (20 mg/kg/day of Trimethoprim) and prednisone 40 mg twice daily through feeding tube were started after Pneumocystis jirovecii was identified in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid on ECMO day 1. Subsequently, serology confirmed HIV-1 infection with CD4+ cell count of 84/mm3 of blood (normal: 600-1500/mm3 of blood) and HIV viral load of 907,302 copies/mL. Patient\u2019s respiratory parameters progressively improved (Table 1), his blood pressure was maintained without vasopressor support and other organs function including the kidneys remained normal throughout ECMO therapy and ICU stay. Neuro-muscular paralysis was held on ECMO day 2 followed by weaning off sedation on ECMO day 3. The patient was able to tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) by ECMO day 4 and he was successfully de-cannulated after 6 days of V-V ECMO support. Patient was extubated the next day, followed by aggressive physiotherapy/mobilization and transfer to medical ward in the next 48 h. There were no complications related to ECMO therapy in this patient during ICU stay and on follow-up post discharge. Patient was explained about his diagnosis and highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART: Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir) was initiated in the medical ward. He was discharged in good general condition after 21 days of hospitalization with follow-up appointment in Infectious Disease clinic.",

            "text": "The frequency of ICU admission for Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunocompromised patients is decreasing but mortality is high if it progresses to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation [5]. The most common manifestation on chest radiographs is bilateral interstitial or alveolar opacities. Parenchymal/sub-pleural cysts and pneumatoceles are frequently seen on CT scan. Spontaneous pneumothorax can occur in up to 36 % of patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [5, 6]. However, spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication with no reported incidence rates. The mechanism of spontaneous pneumomediastinum can be explained by the existence of a decreasing pressure gradient between the alveoli and the lung interstitium that can result in alveolar rupture. This leads to the accumulation of air in the interstitium that circulates centripetally through the venous sheaths to the hilum and mediastinum as the pressure in the mediastinum is lower than that of the lung periphery [7]. Our patient developed pneumomediastinum while on NIV. Barotrauma is very uncommon and pneumothorax following NIV occurs in less than 5 % of cases [8]. Development of pneumomediastinum in Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patient receiving NIV has been reported previously [9]. This could be explained by the rupture of pre-existing pneumatoceles or cysts under the effect of positive pressure ventilation.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life threatening respiratory condition. The Berlin definition classifies ARDS as mild, moderate and severe according to the value of PaO2/FiO2 ratio (Table 2) [10]. The main supportive therapy for ARDS is positive pressure mechanical ventilation which helps to ensure adequate oxygenation. A landmark trial conducted in the late 1990s by the ARDS Network compared conventional tidal volume of 12 ml/kg with low tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and permissive hypercapnia. A 9 % absolute mortality reduction was found in the low tidal volume ventilation group. In this study, target tidal volume was calculated based on ideal body weight (IBW) with targeted plateau pressures of <30 cm H2O and permissive hypercapnia [1]. Our patient did not retain CO2 while breathing spontaneously or supported by NIV. But soon after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation he developed severe hypercapnia. This could be explained by the fact that during spontaneous breathing patient was inhaling large tidal volumes which resulted in increased minute ventilation and adequate CO2 clearance at the expense of high trans-pulmonary pressures resulting in worsening of air leak. After intubation, sedation and paralysis; lung protective ventilation was provided which resulted in severe (permissive) hypercapnia. Thus, ventilating this patient with ARDS and air leak syndrome was challenging because a balance was to be maintained between providing adequate gas exchange and preventing worsening of pneumomediastinum. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines for Adult Respiratory Failure 2013 have listed carbon dioxide retention on mechanical ventilation despite high plateau pressures (>30 cm H2O) and severe air leak syndrome as indications for initiating extracorporeal life support [11]. Based on these recommendations we provided ECMO therapy to our patient, as a bridge to recovery from severe pulmonary infection.",

All reported patients required V-V ECMO support for primarily respiratory failure other than the case reported by Gutermann et al, who was provided V-A (veno-arterial) ECMO therapy post cardiac arrest. 5 out of 8 patients had concomitant pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum which could have possibly worsened the respiratory failure, necessitating rescue ECMO therapy. The timing for initiation of V-V ECMO in severe respiratory failure remains debatable. However, based on previous studies it has been observed that increased pre-ECMO ventilation duration is associated with worse outcomes [16]. One of the exclusion criteria in CESAR trial was high pressure (>30 cm H2O of peak inspiratory pressure) and/or high FiO2 (>0.8) ventilation >7 days [2]. In our patient the duration of pre-ECMO invasive ventilation was very short and this could be one of the contributing factor for his improved outcome. Fifty percent of the reported cases survived to hospital discharge. It is interesting to note that the patients who survived had a shorter duration of ECMO support (mean 9.25 versus 41 days). Advanced patient age, increased pre-ECMO ventilation duration, diagnosis category and complications while on ECMO are some of the factors associated with adverse outcomes in patients receiving ECMO support [17].",

The most common complication encountered in ECMO patients is bleeding. Cannula site, surgical site, central nervous system and gastrointestinal bleeding are the most frequent hemorrhagic complications. Infection is also relatively common, with culture proven infections occurring in approximately 20 % of adult respiratory ECMO patients. Mechanical complications such as oxygenator failure, clotting, air in the circuit and tubing rupture are other important considerations [18, 19].",

As such, we have developed a \u2018Severe Respiratory Failure\u2019 team at our hospital that receives referrals from ICUs across the country.
