The composition of the swift's saliva resembles that of salivary mucin. Many studies have been carried out on the tonic effects of EBN, and it has been shown that EBN stimulates mitosis hormones and the growth factor for epidermal growth, resulting in repair of cells and stimulation of the immune system (Kong et al., 1987, Ng et al., 1986). Recently, several carbohydrate molecules, including new sialic acid-containing compounds and glycoconjugates, have been detected in EBN (Pozsgay et al., 1987, Reuter et al., 1989, Wieruszeski et al., 1987, Kakehi et al., 1994, Martin et al., 1977, Yu-Qin et al., 2000), but the importance of sialic acid residues in EBN is not clear.",

The grounded samples were kept in distilled water (5 g sample/200 ml water) at 5 \u00b0C for 16 h and then heated at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min. The suspension was treated with Pancreatin F (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, Amano Enzyme Inc., Japan) at 45 \u00b0C for 4 h at pH 8.5\u20139.0 and then heated at 90 \u00b0C for 5 min for enzyme deactivation. The treated extracts were filtrated with a filter paper (ADVANTEC filter paper no. 2), and the filtrate was freeze-dried.

LDH activities in the medium were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the medium (0.0125 ml) was diluted to 1:4 (v/v) with PBS and mixed with 0.05 ml of LDH reagent (Shinotest, Japan).

Peak 2 in panel c is much higher than that in panel b. After alkali hydrolysis with 1N NaOH for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C, peak 2 became lower and peak 1 became higher (panel d), indicating that the EBN extract from S2 has an O-acetyl sialic acid species. We further examined the linkages between non-reducing terminal sialic acid to Gal in the EBN extract using sialic acid-Gal linkage-specific lectins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Since MAA (specificity for sialic acid terminally linked 2-3 to Gal in N-glycan and O-glycan) bound strongly to the EBN extract from S1 and weakly to the EBN extract from S2, it is possible that MAA can not bind to O-acetyl sialic acid to Gal linkage. On the other hand, SNA [specificity for sialic acid terminally linked 2-6 to Gal (or GalNAc) in N-glycan] did not react with either of the EBN extracts. These findings suggest that the sialyl-glycoconjugates of the EBN extract from S1 have Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal linkages and that the EBN extract from S2 also have an O-acetylated Neu5Ac, while Neu5Ac is the major sialic acid species.

Not only influenza A viruses but also other microbes, such as influenza B and C viruses, parainfluenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus, coronavirus and bacteria (cholera), recognize sialic acid and its derivatives, O-acetylated sialic acid-containing sugar chains as its receptor (Guo et al., 1998, Schultze et al., 1990, Suzuki et al., 2001a, Suzuki et al., 2001b, Sillerud et al., 1981). Although the O-acetylated sialic acid-containing sugar chains in the EBN are not a good source of the inhibitory activity for influenza A viruses, they may have an effective roles against other viruses which recognize O-acetylated sialic acid, such as influenza C virus and coronavirus.",
