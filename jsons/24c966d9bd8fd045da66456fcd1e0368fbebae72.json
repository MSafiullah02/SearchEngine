HAP affects 0.5% to 1.0% of inpatients and is the most common healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) contributing to death. 1 It is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7-9 days. 2 In a proportion of patients, HAP is associated with mechanical ventilation, in which case it is termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In patients with VAP, there is a 24% to 50% mortality rate, which increases to 76% if infection is caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. 3 VAP accounts for up to 25% of all intensive care unit (ICU) infections with the risk being highest during early ICU stay when it is estimated to be 3%/day during the first 5 days of ventilation, followed by 2%/day up to day 10 of ventilation and thereafter 1%/day. 4 These features of high incidence with significant morbidity and mortality consequences have driven considerable recent interest in the creation of HAP guidelines. Prevention of HAP is therefore not only desirable but also essential for providing cost-effective healthcare. The Department of Health (DH) in its 'Saving Lives' initiative has seven high-impact interventions that are part of the programme to reduce HCAI and one of these relates to the care of the ventilated patient. 5 Although guidelines for HAP in the UK have not been previously published, a total of 10 international HAP guidelines have been released over the last 7 years. 6 Of these, only one both used a systematic review of the literature approach and covered each of prevention, diagnosis and treatement. 7 These American Thoracic Society guidelines, however, used a semi-qualitative approach to assessment and did not weigh fully both the strength and the quality of the evidence. Over half of the available guidelines are based on expert opinion and cover only one or two of the three The work on diagnosis is divided into three sections that cover the main diagnostic approaches for HAP: clinical assessment, radiological investigation and microbiological investigation. Similarly, treatment is divided into five sections to include the different aspects of patient care. These cover both the use of antimicrobials in prevention and in treatment, the role of invasive sampling and quantitative microbiology of respiratory secretions in directing antibiotic therapy, the use of adjunctive therapies and the application of clinical protocols.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 238, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 294, "end": 295, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 578, "end": 579, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 845, "end": 846, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1330, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1491, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1627, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Only a limited number of studies addressed this issue.

Immunization to prevent HAP Immunization relevant to the prevention of HAP includes, particularly, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Most published papers cover influenza (including influenza pneumonia), the elderly and healthcare workers and mainly relate to outbreaks in nursing homes. A meta-analysis 27 reviewing this area included 20 observational studies of HAP in the elderly and there are also cohort studies 28, 29 and three RCTs. 30 -32 Existing UK guidance 33 already highlights the importance of immunization against influenza and pneumococcal disease for high-risk adult and paediatric patients. Immunization of healthcare workers involved with at-risk patients is also recommended. However, there is no direct evidence that influenza immunization of healthcare workers or patients will directly reduce the incidence of HAP, although one study 28 found evidence to suggest that influenza immunization prevents pneumonia in elderly patients. The same study reported that a failure to immunize healthcare workers against influenza was associated with an increased mortality from 'influenza like illness' in elderly patients.

In the culture-positive population, the emergence of resistance did not occur more frequently in the study group when compared with the control group. Finally, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the incidence of adverse reactions, with the exception of a higher frequency of supraventricular tachycardia among patients in the study group. The small sample size and the large number of patients who could not be evaluated are major deficiencies of this study. In a second RCT, tobramycin or placebo was nebulized via ET tubes to patients with VAP; all of the patients were also treated with parenteral antibiotics. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of time to extubation or tolerability. This study suffers from a small sample size. 232 A systematic review of patients with CF has demonstrated that aerosolized antipseudomonal antibiotics are associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidences of acute exacerbations. 318 The applicability of these findings to patients with VAP is uncertain, but is worthy of further study.
