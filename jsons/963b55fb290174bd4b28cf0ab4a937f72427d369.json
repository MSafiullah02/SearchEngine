Our results indicate that a number of characteristics expected during a \"flight to safety\" were present during the period analysed. The volatility relationship between the main Chinese stock markets and Bitcoin evolved significantly during this period of enormous financial stress. We provide a number of observations as to why this situation occurred. Such dynamic correlations during periods of stress present further evidence to cautiously support the validity of the development of this new financial product within mainstream portfolio design through the diversification benefits provided.",

            "text": "The escalation of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic represented a global example of the fragility of the world in which we live and as to how vulnerable we are as a society to exceptional risks. However, such financial implications did not proceed without forewarning. In previous pandemics, such as the outbreak of 2003, Bhuyan et al. [2010] found that the stock market returns of the infected countries exhibited a significant increase in the cointegrated relationship and dynamic comovements, when compared to the pre-SARS period. While considering both the physical and psychological re-estimation of financial markets as to how global finance will return to normality in the aftermath the current global pandemic, our understanding of the interactions between financial assets must be scrutinised, particularly due to the ever-expanding side-effects of technological development of both the exchange, the speed of information flow ), the role of algorithmic trading (Jarrow and Protter [2012] , Kirilenko et al. [2017] ), and in more recent times, as to how digital currencies can act as not only a store of value during periods of market turmoil, but also as a source of portfolio diversification. Gil-Alana et al. [2020] identified a potential role for cryptocurrencies in investor portfolios as a significant diversification option for investors, with particular emphasis on Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Omane-Adjepong and Alagidede [2019] identified that any probable diversification benefits within cryptocurrencies are most like to be found within intra-week to intramonthly time horizons for specific market pairs, while the level of inter-market connectedness and volatility interlinkages are identified as being sensitive to both liquidity and volatility. Liu [2019] further identified portfolio benefits from the inclusion of cryptocurrency. When specifically investigating the market relationships between cryptocurrency and other traditional financial variables, Bouri et al. [2017] found that Bitcoin is a poor hedge and is suitable for diversification purposes only, a result that was echoed when considering the S&P500 exchange (Tiwari et al. [2019] ) and for each of the Eurostoxx 50, the Nikkei 225 and the CSI 300 (Feng et al. [2018] ). More recently, Conlon and McGee [2020] suggests that Bitcoin was neither a safe haven nor a hedge against the extreme bear market in the S&P500 occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We utilise these events to generate dummy variables through which we analyse the contagion effects centred in the price volatility of both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Ramelli and Wagner [2020] identified that the COVID-19 pandemic had morphed into an economic crisis amplified through financial channels through a whipsaw pattern as corporate investors became increasingly worried about the accumulation of corporate debt and the substantial liquidity shortage that had manifested. Through the inclusion of these Chinese financial markets, denoted as the epicentre of the COVID-2019 pandemic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a measure of international financial performance (Ekinci et al. [2019] ), West Texas Intermediate oil and gold as international flight to safety assets (Akyildirim et al.

While some strong relationships between markets are identified when analysing the full sample of data, a number of interesting observations arise when considering the periods both before and after the start of the pandemic. Considering both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, COVID-19 is found to have a strong, significant positive impact on the volatility of each exchange. There is evidence of quite a sheltered interaction between Chinese and US financial markets, +0.119 and +0.160 for Shanghai and Shenzhen respectively. Similarly, there is quite a subdued positive interrelationship between WTI and Chinese stock markets, albeit it strongly significant. It is very interesting to note that neither gold nor cryptocurrencies, as measured through the price dynamics of Bitcoin, are found to have a significant relationship with Chinese stock markets. However, when analysing this same relationship using high-frequency data as presented in Figure 2 , we notice a peculiar interaction between Chinese stocks indices at the point of the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Despite the elevation in dynamic correlations, the Chinese markets themselves held up remarkably well in the face of the domestic phase of the pandemic. A partial explanation might arise from the findings in Albulescu [2020] which finds that the spread of COVID-19 geographically is closely related to the degree of financial instability. Similarly Caporale et al. [2020] shows profound non-linear and phase transition behaviour in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is also exceptionally volatile. In the January-February period it showed a significant rise, led it is argued by fundamentals including position forming before an expected May forking event 2 , much but not all of which was erased as the global spread of the virus manifested. The two Chinese indices showed resilience over this period, as there was a sharp drop quickly erased as the Wuhan situation peaked as the perception of the Chinese government taking control was widespread. Gold prices also rose over this period, the early March period excepted but then showing a massive spiking as global travel restrictions and supply chain disruptions impacted supply.",
