            "text": "Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an investigational monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog that was developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. In its active triphosphate nucleoside form, remdesivir binds to ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase and acts as an RNA-chain terminator. It displays potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 at 48 hours of 0.77 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells [3]. Similar activity has been demonstrated against other zoonotic coronaviruses with EC50 values of 0.07 \u00b5M demonstrated for both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [3\u20136]. Remdesivir is highly selective for viral polymerases and is therefore expected to have a low propensity to cause human toxicity. Accordingly, Sheahan et al [6] demonstrated a wide therapeutic index for remdesivir in a human airway epithelial cell model. The drug also displays a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and has a long intracellular half-life that allows for once-daily dosing [7, 8]. The dose under investigation for treatment of COVID-19 is 200 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily for up to 10 days, infused over 30\u201360 minutes (Table 1).",

            "text": "The therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir was first described in an animal model against Ebola among infected rhesus monkeys in which once-daily dosing resulted in suppression of viral replication and protection from lethal disease [9]. However, in a human study, remdesivir-treated patients with Ebola experienced a 28-day mortality rate of 53% in a randomized controlled trial of 4 experimental therapies conducted in response to the Democratic Republic of Congo outbreak of 2018, resulting in early termination of this study arm [10]. It is worth noting that this trial did not have an active control arm, and mortality rates for the other experimental treatments were 49.7% (ZMapp), 35.1% (Mab114), and 33.5% (REGN-EB3). Against MERS-CoV, Sheahan et al [5] evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir among infected mice and found treatment significantly reduced virus lung titers, weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and lung injury scores. The authors proposed the importance of early therapy initiation to diminish virus replication and promote pulmonary repair because remdesivir demonstrated less clinical benefit with high-titer virus inoculum. Most notably, the authors also noted that prophylactic remdesivir diminished MERS-CoV replication and disease, which was similar to their findings in a murine model with SARS-CoV-1 [5, 6].",

The patient experienced clinical improvement and negativity of oropharyngeal swab on hospital day 8, although nasopharyngeal swab remained positive. No adverse events to remdesivir were reported for the patient, which is consistent with previous case reports of use in other viruses [12, 13]. Among the first 12 patients confirmed by the CDC to have COVID-19 in the United States, 3 were treated with remdesivir via compassionate use protocol [14]. All patients reported transient gastrointestinal symptoms and aminotransferase elevation. All patients are reportedly recovering, but the authors were unable to assess the efficacy or safety of remdesivir based on the lack of comparator and confounding treatments, including concomitant use of corticosteroids in one patient.",

Two additional trials recruiting only in China have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04257656 (severe disease) and NCT04252664 (mild/moderate disease). Remdesivir may also be obtained through compassionate use and the emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) application process. At the time of this review, requests for compassionate use must be submitted online via https://rdvcu.gilead.com/. Compassionate use is only considered for hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 requiring mechanical ventilation in whom enrollment in a clinical trial is not feasible. Patients are excluded from the compassionate use program if they do not meet the above criteria, have evidence of multiorgan failure, are receiving vasopressors for hypotension, have liver disease defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) or renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min, or receiving dialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for compassionate use may change, so applicants are encouraged to review the most up to date criteria for all potential patients. Clinicians should be cognizant that it typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for institutions to receive emergency institutional review board authorization (if required), protocol, and consent forms from Gilead, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval for the eIND, and eventual drug shipment. Clinicians should coordinate with their local information technology teams to build a medication order sentence into the electronic health record during this time. Patients may receive other antiviral therapies during the waiting period but must immediately discontinue them if they receive remdesivir for compassionate use.",

However, the protocol also stated \u201calthough remdesivir is a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in vitro, coadministration with inhibitors of these CYP isoforms is unlikely to markedly increase remdesivir levels, as its metabolism is likely to be predominantly mediated by hydrolase activity.\u201d Unlike the former, the latter statement is substantiated by well described chemistry of the molecule. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was contacted about this discrepancy and in collaboration with Gilead, this has been corrected. There is no reason to believe that any significant drug interactions between remdesivir and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are likely [8].",

These findings have supported the clinical use of chloroquine, at a dose of 500 mg by mouth twice daily, in numerous clinical trials in China during this outbreak. Although the rationale for this dosing regimen remains unclear, and peer reviewed data from the trials are currently unavailable, it was announced in mid-February that promising early results have been demonstrated. Per Gao et al [16], \u201cthus far, results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing.

In this analysis, the investigators utilized human population pharmacokinetic and rat lung penetration data for each compound to estimate free trough concentrations in the lung to EC50 ratios (RLTEC) [18]. Because 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily has been reported to demonstrate efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the target RLTEC for hydroxychloroquine regimens was set to \u22652.38 (day 1), 5.92 (day 3), and 18.9 (day 5), which were the RLTEC values predicted with the \u201cefficacious\u201d 500 mg by mouth twice-daily dosing of chloroquine [16]. Various dosing regimens were simulated, but 2 are particularly notable. The first was an oral loading dose of 1200 mg (divided 800 mg then 400 mg) on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily. This regimen led to significantly higher RLTEC on day 1 (33.3), day 3 (55.1), and day 5 (103) than those values demonstrated with chloroquine. The second regimen was a loading dose of 800 mg (400 mg \u00d7 2) on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily. This was also associated with higher RLTEC values than chloroquine on day 1, 3, and 5 (corresponding to 21.0, 38.9, and 85.4, respectively) [18]. The authors concluded that these data support the lower dose regimen because RLTEC values were significantly higher than those with the \u201cproven efficacious\u201d regimen of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily. Clinicians should note that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have half-lives of ~40 days [19], and therefore short durations would likely provide prolonged courses of therapy. This was exemplified in the PBPK modeling in which RLTEC values with hydroxychloroquine were predicted to still be above the targeted efficacy threshold on day 10, even with a 5-day course of therapy.",

The use of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily as the reference for efficacy is rational given initial reports from China [16], but it is important to note that this dosing still requires validation, and the improved RLTEC values reported are largely driven by the finding that hydroxychloroquine was 7.6 times more potent than chloroquine in vitro. Although this enhanced potency may very well prove true as more data become available, this report is counter to the relative potency demonstrated with the structurally similar SARS-CoV-1 strain in 2006 in which chloroquine was approximately 5 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine. In addition, a recently published study has demonstrated that the EC50 value for chloroquine is 1.13 \u00b5M [3], similar to the value reported for hydroxychloroquine in the analysis by Yao et al [18].",

If one were to consider these 2 compounds to be equally potent (identical EC50 values) and utilize the PBPK data from Yao et al [18], the 800 mg load, 400 mg daily regimen for hydroxychloroquine would yield RLTEC values of 2.76, 5.11, and 11.2 on day 1, 3, and 5, respectively. These RLTEC values would be slightly lower than those achieved with 500 mg by mouth twice daily of chloroquine on day 3 and significantly lower than those on day 5, suggesting the potential need for a higher dose to have similar activity. Although the 400 mg daily regimen is the most common regimen currently being assessed in clinical trials, the rationale for that dose is currently unclear, and at least 1 clinical trial in China is using a higher dose of 800 mg by mouth daily.",

            "text": "To this point, Gautret et al [20] recently published their initial experience on the impact of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine by mouth every 8 hours on viral eradication in patients with COVID-19. The authors reported on 36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine and 16 control) who were COVID-19 positive and able to have nasopharyngeal sampling for the first 6 days of therapy (in the treated arm). The investigators demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine (14 of 20, 70%) was superior to standard of care (2 of 16, 12.5%; P = .001) in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. It is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin \u201cto prevent bacterial super-infection\u201d and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup (6 of 6, 100%) compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone (8 of 14, 57%). The authors concluded that azithromycin \u201creinforced\u201d the SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved by hydroxychloroquine. Although these data are intriguing, certain limitations to this data set must be acknowledged. First, although viral eradication is an important endpoint, the authors did not report clinical outcomes in these patients. Second, the cohort initially contained 26 hydroxychloroquine patients, but 6 of them were removed from the analysis due to early cessation of hydroxychloroquine therapy including 3 PCR-positive patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 1 PCR-negative patient who passed away, and 1 PCR-positive patient who discontinued hydroxychloroquine due to nausea. Finally, the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy arm included patients with significantly higher viral loads, represented by lower cycle threshold (CT) values than those who received combination therapy. If the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy patients with CT values <23 are separated from those with CT values \u226523, there is a notable discordance in viral eradication rates (1 of 5, 20% vs 7 of 9, 78%), with this latter number approaching the 6 of 6 demonstrated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy in which all patients had CT values \u226523. Given this finding, the small numbers in this study, the lack of clinical outcomes presented, the potential for additive toxicity with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and the desperate need to practice good antimicrobial stewardship during the COVID-19 pandemic, we would caution clinicians against using these data to support combination therapy.",

Lopinavir seems to block the main protease of SARS-CoV-1, inhibiting viral replication [22]. In 2003, Chu et al [23] evaluated a series of antivirals for in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-1. They reported lopinavir at 4 \u00b5g/mL and ribavirin at 50 \u00b5g/mL inhibited SARS-CoV-1 after 48 hours of incubation and that the agents were synergistic when used together [23]. de Wilde et al [24] later described the antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1 and demonstrated an EC50 17.1 \u00b1 1 in Vero E6 cells, which is near the upper range of LPV plasma concentrations previously measured in patients with HIV [25]. Sheahan et al [5] evaluated the in vitro efficacy of LPV/r in combination with interferon beta (INFb) against MERS-CoV and found the addition of LPV/r did not significantly enhance antiviral activity of INFb alone (EC50 = 160 vs 175 IU/mL, respectively). They also described the EC50 of LPV/r (8.5 \u00b5M) and LPV alone (11.6 \u00b5M), suggesting similar activity to that described for SARS CoV-1. Despite in vitro activity against MERS-CoV, therapeutic doses of LPV/r + INFb in mice models failed to reduce virus titer and exacerbated lung disease [5]. This is notable because this was the same study in which remdesivir demonstrated both more potent in vitro activity as well as in vivo efficacy. However, the in vivo animal data for MERS-CoV appears equivocal given that a nonhuman primate model demonstrated improved clinical and pathological features after LPV/r treatment [26]. A randomized controlled trial of LPV/r and recombinant interferon-\u03b21b versus placebo is currently enrolling for patients with MERS-CoV, which might help clarify the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and animal models [27].",

If used, drug interactions must be screened, and gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity, require close monitoring, particularly because elevated aspartate transaminase or ALT may exclude patients with COVID-19 from clinical trials. The LPV/r tablets can be taken without regard to food but should not be crushed because this decreases systemic exposure; solution should be used in patients who cannot receive intact tablets [38].",

Interleukin-6, which is secreted by monocytes and macrophages, is one of the main drivers of immunologic response and symptoms in patients with cytokine-release syndrome (CRS). Although tocilizumab was first approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it has gained traction in recent years for treatment of patients with CRS following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy as a corticosteroid-sparing agent [42]. Indeed, it received FDA approval for severe or life-threatening CAR T-associated CRS in 2017 due to its efficacy and safety profile. Although criteria for grading CRS severity varies by cancer center, it has been proposed to administer tocilizumab to CRS patients with any of the following: oxygen requirement <40%, hypotension responsive to fluids or a low dose of a single vasoactive agent, or Grade 2 organ toxicity as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [43]. Interleukin-6 antagonism may make a patient more susceptible to bacterial infection and has been associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving chronic therapy with tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis. In a case series of 53 adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Grade 3 CRS or higher was associated with increased risk of subsequent infection, but it was unclear whether tocilizumab or corticosteroid use promoted this risk [44]. There were no reported adverse events in the 60 tocilizumab-treated patients submitted to the FDA for the CRS indication, which recommends a maximum of 4 doses for treatment [45].",

The potential benefit of these agents to blunt the inflammatory cascade seen in severe disease needs to be carefully weighed against the concerns for secondary infections, adverse events, and other complications of corticosteroid therapy. The data assessing the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive care for severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia are difficult to interpret. Given the retrospective observational nature of these analyses, there is significant confounding by indication that is difficult to control or correct for in addition to limited sample sizes. Patients who receive corticosteroids have a higher severity of illness, are more likely to require invasive interventions, and are more likely to be receiving intensive care. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity with regard to timing of corticosteroid initiation, which can significantly impact disease progression and likelihood of response. All of these features lead to patients who receive steroids being at increased risk for poor outcomes. In addition, there is great variation in agent and dosage used, which can impact both safety and efficacy. Therefore, clinicians making any therapeutic decisions based on the literature for corticosteroids need to keep these considerations in mind.",

However, toxicities are substantial including severe cytopenias, hepatotoxicity (including fatality), neuropsychiatric events, and risk of developing fatal or life-threatening ischemia or infection, particularly when combined with ribavirin. This combination was not associated with improved mortality or enhanced viral clearance in a retrospective analysis of patients infected with MERS-CoV who were initiated on combination therapy within 1\u20133 days of ICU admission [57]. Despite the limited to poor data, Chinese guidelines recommend ribavirin 500 mg IV 2\u20133 times daily in combination with LPV/r or inhaled interferon-\u03b1 (5 million units nebulized twice daily) as one of the \u201cstandard treatment\u201d options for COVID-19.

            "text": "Given their antiviral activity against influenza, considerable attention has been paid to oseltamivir, and to a lesser degree baloxavir, as potential treatment options for COVID-19. This was exacerbated by the initial report from Huang et al [1] in Wuhan where patients managed with COVID-19 received oseltamivir in addition to broad-spectrum antimicrobials. It is important to note that use of oseltamivir was not as targeted therapy of SARS-CoV-2 but rather driven by the lack of a knowledge of the causative pathogen at the time of treatment and the desire to empirically treat influenza. The authors do not suggest the use of oseltamivir for COVID-19 in that publication, and there are no data that suggest in vitro activity of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the only data assessing oseltamivir activity against coronaviruses demonstrated it to be ineffective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-1, even at a concentration of 10 000 \u00b5M/L [56]. Coronaviruses do not utilize neuraminidase, and thus there is no enzyme to be inhibited by oseltamivir. This would hold true for zanamivir, peramivir, or any other neuraminidase inhibitor agents. Similarly, neither a defined mechanism nor in vitro data have suggested that baloxavir would demonstrate activity against SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. Therefore, given the critical need for these agents in the management of influenza and concern for drug shortages with oseltamivir, these agents should be avoided in patients with COVID-19 once influenza has been ruled out.",

Given that disease progression can occur rapidly in stable patients and that viral loads are highest early in the infection course, the authors of this review opine that rapid initiation of therapy in high-risk populations (patients who are hospitalized or outpatients who are at high risk of complications) is rational and should be considered, ideally in the context of a well-controlled, adequately powered trial. More important, however, this strategy is not without risk and needs to be weighed against potential adverse events (that remain poorly defined) and impending drug shortages with increases in use of these agents. To help address these concerns, careful consideration should be given to duration of therapy with many clinical trials and institutional protocols recommending 5\u20137 days for uncomplicated disease. Duration of therapy should be individualized to the patient and the progression of disease.",
