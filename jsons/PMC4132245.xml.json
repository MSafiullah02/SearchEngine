H1N1pdm09 infection resulted in a substantial diseases burden with a minority of infected subjects developing life-threatening respiratory complications. Estimates of H1N1pdm09-associated mortality are similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, but most deaths occurred in healthy people younger than 65 years old [1,2]. Also, strong differences in mortality were observed depending on ethnicity and geographic location [1,2]. Whereas these trends are likely to be partially explained by epidemiological aspects (e.g. previous exposure to antigenically similar viruses), host genetic and non-genetic factors were proposed to play a role. In particular, non-genetic risk factors were shown to include pregnancy, morbid obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and immunosuppression [2]. Nonetheless, a large majority of severely affected subjects were healthy and did not present any risk condition, suggesting that genetic effects might modulate H1N1pdm09 disease course.",

Nevertheless, no subsequent analysis addressed the role of these variants and the study design was likely to yield false positives, as noted [6]. Several other reports have explored the role of human genetic variants in the modulation of H1N1pdm09 infection severity, but only two variants have been analyzed in at least two independent studies. The first one, a functional variant in the IFITM3 gene (rs12252), was originally described in a cohort of 53 influenza UK cases who developed severe respiratory complications [7]. The association was confirmed in a study of H1N1 cases in China, where the frequency of the minor predisposing genotype is much higher [8]. Nonetheless, the rarity of the risk genotype (only 3 homozygotes drove the association in the UK study) suggests that this variant makes a contribution to H1N1 disease severity in Europe. The second candidate variant is represented by a 32-bp polymophic deletion in the CCR5 gene, the so-called CCR5\u039432 allele, which is almost exclusive to individuals with European ancestry. In a Canadian sample of 9 Caucasian patients with severe H1N1pdm09 infection Keynan et al. [9] found a nearly 5-fold enrichment of CCR5\u039432 heterozygotes compared to the expectation based on allele frequency in populations with European ancestry. This association found support by the description of a fatal case of H1N1pdm09 infection: the young patient was homozygous for the CCR5\u039432 allele, a status that occurs in a small minority of subjects (0.02% to 2% depending on the population) [10]. Also, studies in a Ccr5\n\u2212/\u2212\n mice have indicated that, when infected with influenza A virus, these animals display accelerated macrophage accumulation in the lungs and increased mortality compared to wild-type mice [11].",

            "text": "We evaluate the possible association between the CCR5\u039432 allele and severe H1N1pdm09 infection in patients form Southern Europe. CCR5 has been shown to be important for cell-mediated immune response against H1N1pdm09 [13,14] and the CCR5\u039432 allele confers increased susceptibility to symptomatic infection with other viral species such as West Nile virus (WNV) [15]. In this latter case, though, the association model is recessive - i.e. only homozygotes are at higher risk of developing a severe disease following WNV infection [15]. The recessive model is consistent with the loss-of-function effect of the 32-bp deletion in CCR5 and may apply to other phenotype associations, as it also describes a strong [16] but not complete [17] resistance to HIV-1 infection. The previously reported association between the CCR5\u039432 and severe H1N1pdm09 infection implied a non-recessive model, as a large excess of heterozygotes was described among critically ill patients [9]. Data herein do not confirm this finding and suggest that CCR5\u039432 does not play a major role in modulating H1N1pdm09 infection severity. It should be noted, however, that both Keynan\u2019s [9] and this study suffer from the limitation of the small sample size and are underpowered to detect a recessive effect of CCR5\u039432 on H1N1 disease course. Also, the CCR5\u039432 allele tends to vary in frequency with a latitudinal cline [12], suggesting that population stratification might also affect the association results for this variant. Likewise, the rs12252 polymorphism in IFITM3 previously associated with H1N1pdm09 disease severity shows strong frequency variation depending on ancestry. Its frequency is very low in Europe (but much higher in Asia) and a recent analysis of 34 severe H1N1pdm09 patients from the UK detected no association (whereas an effect of the rare homozygous genotype was detected for mild influenza) [18].",
