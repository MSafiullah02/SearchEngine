May be able to see asymmetric hyperinflation in side with foreign body.Most foreign bodies are not seen, as they are radiolucent.\n\n\nGeneral Signs and Symptoms\n\nStridor/wheezing\nInspiratory\u2014Extrathoracic swelling or obstruction will lead to airway collapse on inspiration. Example: LaryngomalaciaExpiratory\u2014Intrathoracic swelling or obstruction will lead to airway collapse on expiration. Example: Tracheomalacia\nBiphasic stridor\u2014indicates fixed airflow obstruction\u2014subglottic space obstruction\nLaryngomalacia: Most common cause of stridor in infants, accounts for up to 75% of all causes of stridorChoanal atresia: Infant/newborn in respiratory distress with inability to pass a 6F catheter into oropharynx through noseLeft vocal cord paralysis: Associated with trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve at birth or surgical traumaSubglottic hemangioma: 50% accompanied by cutaneous hemangiomas of head and neck. Inspiratory or biphasic stridor, which worsens as hemangiomas enlargeViral croup: Course of viral croup in infants younger than 1 year of age is prolonged. Symptoms often improve during the day with recurrence of symptoms in the early hours of the morning.Epiglottitis: Stridor is not a prominent feature.\n\nCough\nNocturnal cough is rare in normal childrenAssociations: Brassy (tracheal irritation, tracheomalacia); barky (croup); honking (habit cough); staccato (chlamydia, mycoplasma); paroxysmal/whoop (pertussis, CF, FB)\n\nExercise intolerance\nVocal cord dysfunction: More common in adolescent females. May mimic EIA\u2014need to consider if not responding to EIA treatment\n\nHemoptysis\nDifferentiating from hematemesis (vomiting blood) and epistaxis (nasal bleeding) can be tricky.Most common reason for symptom usually not true hemoptysis, but bleeding from upper airway (e.g., nasal bleeding)\n\nCongenital airway and pulmonary malformations\nWith symptoms and presenting during infancy, most will require surgical intervention.\n\nAcute bronchiolitis\nMost common lower respiratory tract infection in < 2 yearsEtiology: RSV > 50%Apnea may be more prominent than wheezing in infants < 2 months or former preterm infants.Peak symptomatology at days 3\u20134 of illness (\u201cday of illness\u201d)\u201cDay of illness\u201d: Important variable for providing anticipatory guidance in outpatient management and making decisions regarding admission/dischargeRoutine use of bronchodilators or systemic steroids in management NOT recommended\n\nAsthma\nAsthma symptoms are more common in boys before puberty, but more severe in girls after puberty.Early-phase reaction or Type I IgE-mediated reactions occur within minutes of an allergen-related trigger.A late-phase IgE-mediated reaction follows 2\u201312 h later.Viral respiratory infections (such as RSV and rhinovirus) have been associated with future development of asthma and are the most common trigger of exacerbations in young children.All that wheezes is not asthma! Think about the differential if diagnosis not clear.If cough is the only symptom or chronic sputum production is reported, broaden your differential.ICS are the most potent and effective medication for long-term control of asthma.EIA: In 80% patients, SABA before exercise prevents symptoms for about 2\u20133 h.Acute asthma exacerbation: SpO2 < 92% after an hour of therapy is a good predictor for hospitalization need.\n\nPneumonia\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause in children older than 1 week of age.Viruses account for 14\u201335% of cases.For school-age children needing inpatient therapy: Cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are the antibiotics of choice.\n\nBronchiectasis/cystic fibrosis\nCF is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in pediatric patients in the USA.CFTR dysfunction/absence leads to thick secretions, impaired mucociliary clearance, recurrent inflammation, and infection, leading to development of bronchiectasis.All US states have newborn screening, but results are not 100% sensitive.Diagnostic tests include sweat testing and DNA testing.Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team at a CF care center.Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinumPneumothorax > 5% hemithorax will require chest tube drainage, but pneumomediastinum usually resolves spontaneously.\n\nThoracic cage deformities\nPectus excavatum: > 90% of congenital wall anomaliesScoliosis: Curvatures > 50\u00b0 more likely to be progressive. Extreme curvatures can lead to respiratory compromise due to restrictive chest wall disease.\n\nOSA\nHigher prevalence in African Americans and obese childrenPolysomnography diagnostic test of choiceAdenotonsillectomy is first-line therapy and curative in about 80% of children with OSA.\n\nSIDS\nPeaks at 2\u20134 months of age, male predominance\u201cBack to sleep\u201d supine position for sleep led to marked decline in SIDS rate\n\n",
