The newly emerging pathogen belongs to the same virus family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively). The World Health Organization (WHO) has\nrecently published surveillance recommendations for a possible \u201clarge epidemic or even pandemic\u201d (pandemic declared on March 11\nth, 2020) of the novel coronavirus and it has issued guidelines for hospitals across the world. However, many questions about SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered: (i) what is the origin and/or natural reservoir of the virus? (ii) is it easily transmitted from human to human? and (iii) what are the potential diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine targets? Currently, only nucleotide sequences of eight human SARS-CoV-2 isolates are available without any additional information about biological properties of the virus, beyond the morphological confirmation of the virion using electronic microscopy. This is likely not enough information to answer the important abovementioned questions.",

According to this approach, sequences (protein or DNA) are transformed into signals by assignment of numerical values of each element (amino acid or nucleotide). These values correspond to electron-ion interaction potential\n6, determining electronic properties of amino acid/nucleotides, which are essential for their intermolecular interactions. The signal obtained is then decomposed in a periodical function by the Fourier transformation. The result is a series of frequencies and their amplitudes. The obtained frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs (primary structure) with defined physico-chemical characteristics responsible for the biological function of the putative protein corresponding to the analyzed sequence. When comparing proteins that share same biological or biochemical function, the technique allows detection of code/frequency pairs that are specific for their common biological properties. The method is insensitive to the location of the motifs and, therefore, does not require previous alignment of the sequences. In addition, this is the only method that allows immediate functional analysis.",

The list of human proteins that have a dominant peak in IS at the frequency F(0.478) are given in\nTable 3. According to the IS criterion, these proteins are potential candidate interactors with the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. Further, literature data mining was performed to identify which proteins presented in\nTable 3 might be involved in the processes of infection with human coronaviruses. This analysis revealed that the actin protein plays an important role in the early entry events during human coronavirus infections\n14. Actin proteins were selected as the best candidate interactors for the SARS-CoV-2 among the host proteins that are characterized with frequency F(0.478).\nFigure 5c shows that CS of actins from different mammalian species (\nTable 4) contains the dominant peak on F(0.478), suggesting that actin probably encodes the conserved information important for their biological function.",

Further research on these issues are needed, including the development of reverse genetics and animal models to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the fast evolving of scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, the first prediction has been already confirmed, while the chicken as potential candidate as intermediate host has not been supported.
