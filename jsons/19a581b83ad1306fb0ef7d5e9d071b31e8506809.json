Whilst admission to critical care in our cohort (18.9%) was comparable to national (17%) 6 and international (7.5-26%) 3-5 experience, there was also clear evidence of advanced decision making for individual patients. In all patients who died without receiving ventilation, a ceiling of treatment plan was discussed in advance with the patient and/or their family and documented in the medical record. These patients were more frail, had a higher number of comorbidities, and were more likely to reside in a residential or nursing home, implying that their premorbid risk of death was high. Similarly, a third of patients who died received NIPS for single organ (respiratory) failure where there was an advance decision not to escalate to mechanical ventilation in the event of a failure to respond. Thus death was anticipated in most patients dying in hospital, and palliative care teams provided specialist input into patient management.

This is a consistent finding in COVID-19 across the world, 3,15,16 confirming that regional demographic variations are likely to have a major impact on mortality. Strikingly, we observed no deaths in patients under 55, although overall numbers in this group were relatively small (50/291 [17.2%]). We also examined the influence of ethnicity, finding no evidence of an association. Since there are fewer people from BAME backgrounds in the North East of England compared to other regions, nothing can be inferred from these findings. We were unable to analyse the influence of obesity, which was identified as a factor in the ISARIC cohort, 6 due to missing data on height and weight in this acutely unwell cohort (we considered reports of obesity in clinical notes to be unreliable).
