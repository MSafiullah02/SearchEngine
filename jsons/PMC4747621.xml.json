The human surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter, a gift from Dr Teodora Georgieva (BIO5 Institute, Tucson, Arizona), was used to generate the pSPC-hDPP4 vector. Purified DNA fragments from the pK18-hDPP4 and pSPC-hDPP4 vectors were injected into pronuclei of fertilized B6SJL (C57BL/6J X SJL/J) mouse eggs to generate transgenic embryos. Mice transgenic for hDPP4 expression were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the following primers: forward, CCA AAG ACT GTA CGG GTT CC; and reverse, CCA AAG CTG AAT TGT CTT CCA G.",

Compared with controls (Figure 4A), MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice exhibited perivascular cuffing (Figure 4B and 4E), cellular degeneration, and debris (Figure 4C and 4D) that were absent on day 2, with progressive changes from days 4 to 6 (Table 2). Degenerating and dying neurons sometimes had basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that were quite prominent (Figure 4C and 4F) and immunostained for viral antigen (Figure 4F). MERS-CoV\u2013induced neuronal lesions were most severe in the thalamus and brain stem (Table 2). More-detailed virus antigen staining in brain tissue 2, 4, 6 days after infection is shown in Supplementary Figure 3. N protein staining was rare 2 and 4 days after infection and principally seen in solitary neurons. In contrast, by 6 days after infection, many neurons were infected. Virus antigen 6 days after infection was preferentially located in the midbrain, thalamus, deep cerebral cortex, and CA2 region of the hippocampus but was uncommon in the cerebellum.\n",

To differentiate the importance of brain versus lung infection, we used low inoculum doses, to optimize the likelihood that only the brain or the lung would be infected. We used intranasal inocula of 1000, 100, and 10 PFU/animal. Compared with mice receiving a larger inoculum, the onset of weight loss was delayed from 3\u20134 days after infection to 9\u201310 days after infection (Figure 4G\u2013I). Despite this delayed onset of disease signs, 4 of 5 mice died after receipt of the 1000 PFU inoculum, 4 of 5 mice died after receipt of a 100 PFU inoculum, and 3 of 5 mice died following receipt of a 10 PFU inoculum. In a second experiment, MERS-CoV was detected in brain tissue of 3 of 7 mice infected with 10 PFU (approximately 4 \u00d7 106 PFU/g of tissue) 9 days after infection. No virus was titered from lung tissue (Figure 4I). Thus, mortality correlated with brain infection, suggesting that infection of this organ was most important for the high mortality observed in K18-hDPP4 mice.",

To determine whether MERS-CoV could infect and complete its replication cycle in central nervous system\u2013derived cells, we infected central nervous system\u2013derived human cell lines or primary astrocytes derived from newborn pig brain tissue. Pig cells were previously shown to be permissive to MERS-CoV infection [2]. Human cell lines (U-138 MG and SK-N-SH) and primary porcine astrocytes all expressed DPP4 protein (data not shown). SK-N-SH cells, porcine astrocytes, and control Vero-81 cells supported virus replication (Figure 4J), and this result was confirmed by immunostaining for MERS-CoV antigen (Supplementary Figure 3). No human autopsy samples are available to directly assess virus replication in the brain, but these results support the notion that neurological disease is directly virus induced.",

They sensitized mice to MERS-CoV infection by delivering adenovirus vectors expressing hDPP4 to the lungs of mice. However, only the lung expressed hDPP4, so virus replication in other organs could not be evaluated. Agrawal et al expressed hDPP4 behind a universally expressed promoter [18]. Here we expanded the available mouse models by stably expressing hDPP4 with the SPC and K18 promoters. Both of these promoters exhibit more-restricted expression than the CAGGs promoter used by Agrawal et al [18]. The disease phenotype of the K18-hDPP4 mice shares many features with the results reported by Agrawal et al [18], including fatal disease, with lung and brain involvement. In contrast, the SPC-hDPP4 line demonstrated lower lung tissue viral loads than Ad-hDPP4\u2013sensitized mice [17], without spread to other organs or associated mortality. This suggests that, with infection restricted to the lung, mouse innate immunity may successfully overcome virulence factors expressed by MERS-CoV and prevent a lethal outcome. A mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain may help overcome this limitation.",

Following infection with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, K18-hACE2 mice developed a lethal disease featuring both lung and brain involvement. SARS-CoV spread from the olfactory bulb to primary, secondary, and more-distal connections very rapidly, resulting in lethality. In the present study, the temporal course of brain tissue infection also suggested retrograde virus spread from olfactory neurons. While susceptibility to brain infection sets a high bar for evaluating new therapies for MERS-CoV infection, we demonstrated the utility of the model for vaccine testing.

We note that DPP4 is expressed in the brains of humans and other mammals [23, 27\u201334]. We found that MERS-CoV infects human nervous system\u2013derived cell lines and primary porcine astrocytes. It is possible that if MERS-CoV gains access to the human central nervous system, through disruption of the blood brain barrier, via lymphatics [47], or other routes, there are cells expressing DPP4 that could support virus replication. Current knowledge is limited by the absence of any published postmortem data from persons dying from MERS. Interestingly, Arabi et al recently described 3 patients with MERS who had severe neurologic manifestations, including altered consciousness and diffuse brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging involving the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and the corpus callosum [26]. While there are many reasons that severely ill patients with MERS might manifest neurologic signs and symptoms, this report indicates that MERS can be associated with progressive neurological manifestations. Further data are needed to understand whether some patients with MERS have central nervous system involvement with infection.",
