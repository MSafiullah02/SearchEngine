The virus contains two major surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which can undergo minor antigenic changes leading to yearly epidemics or major changes resulting in influenza pandemics. Currently, there are two circulating influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, in addition to influenza B, present in the United States. H1N1 viruses do not appear to cause serious problems in older persons, possibly due to previous immunity. In 1997, influenza A (H5N1), which was previously seen only in birds, crossed the species barrier and human infection occurred in Southeast Asia (4) . This highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread in bird populations throughout Asia and into Europe.
