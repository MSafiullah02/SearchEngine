The most common cause of hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), which accounts for up to 40\u201350% of cases, but the prevalence may be higher in some pathological conditions, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and pneumonia [2]. Besides infectious diseases, several inflammatory conditions may be complicated by SIAD. In these situations, interleukin-6 (IL-6), released by monocytes and macrophages, plays a pathogenic role in causing electrolyte impairment by inducing the non-osmotic release of vasopressin [3].",

However, based on these original observations, we suggest that [Na+] might represent a readily available biomarker to be considered in the clinical protocols designed for COVID-19 patients. Low [Na+] appears to be inversely related to IL-6 and directly related to P/F ratio, an important index of respiratory performance. [Na+] measurements may be rapidly obtained by the lab or even promptly by hemogasanalysis, and definitively earlier than IL-6. Low [Na+] appears to be associated with a more unfavourable outcome and it may be hypothesized that [Na+] decrease indicates the presence of a more advanced disease. The significant increase of [Na+] after 48 h from the initiation of tocilizumab treatment further suggests the presence of an association between IL-6, vasopressin release and ultimately [Na+] itself. [Na+] is not currently considered among the inclusion criteria for initiating tocilizumab treatment. However, the right timing of administration might be of pivotal importance in determining the effectiveness of tocilizumab and we hypothesize that [Na+] might be of help in decision-making strategies.",
