The Chinese experience shows that critical patients are about 10 % of hospitalized patients (i.e. of those with symptoms serious enough to require hospitalization); and hospitalized patients represented about half of known infected, the other being cured and isolated at home. Similar percentages were observed in the early phase of the COVID epidemic in Italy; the fraction of infectives isolated at home has afterwards diminished, but it is believed that this was due to a different policy for lab exams, i.e. checking prioritarily patients with multiple symptoms suggesting the presence of COVID rather than following the contacts.

We have thus ran a simulation in which \u03b2 and \u03be are not changed, while \u03b1 is reduced by a factor 0.75 (smaller factors, i.e. smaller\u03b1, produce an untenable length of the critical phase); the result of this is shown in Fig.5 .

This strategy would be as effective in containing the contagion (and less costly in terms of laboratory tests) than that of tracking contacts, test them (after a suitable time for the infection to develop and test give positive if this happens), and isolate only those who really turn infective. The difference is that if we isolate everybody this would involve a huge number of people (e.g. all those who have been in the same supermarket the same day as an infective; and their families and contacts etc etc); so in this context early detection actually should be intended as early detection of non-infectives, so that cautionary quarantine can be kept reasonably short in all the cases where it is not really needed.",

It turns out that -both in the classical SIR model and in the modified A-SIR one -social distancing is effective in reducing the epidemic peak, and moreover it slows down the epidemic dynamics. On the other hand, early detection of asymptomatic infectives seems to have only a moderate effect in the reduction of the epidemic peak for what concerns critical cases, and also a very little effect on the temporal development of the epidemic. In contrast, contact tracing has a strong impact on the epidemic peak -also in terms of critical cases -and does not substantially alter the temporal development of the epidemic. [34] Slowing down the epidemic dynamic can be a positive or negative feature depending on the concrete situation and on the desired effects. It is surely positive in what concerns getting ready to face the epidemic peak, in particular in the presence of a faltering Health System. On the other hand, it may be negative in that maintaining a generalized lockdown for a long time can have extremely serious economic and social consequences. Balancing these two aspects is not a matter for the mathematician or the scientist, but for the decision maker; so we will not comment any further about this.",

The problem is how patients with this diagnosis and light symptoms are handled. This point is most relevant, but not the subject of a mathematical modeling paper, so we will not pursue it. On the other hand, I cannot avoid to express the opinion that the real winning point of this regional strategy was (possibly together with some luck, always needed in real life) to follow the indications of a most reliable team working on epidemics control at Padua University and Imperial College, and trust them.",

We have ascertained that with this value of \u03be, and assuming \u03b1 ws not changed by the restrictive measures adopted in the meanwhile, the A-SIR model fits quite well the epidemiological data available to date. However, despite this, we do not trust this hypothesis -at least for Italy -for various reasons, such as (in order of increasing relevance): (i) A viral infection showing effects only in 1% of affected individuals would be rather exceptional; (ii) Albeit in our opinion the effect of social distancing measures adopted in Italy is sometimes overestimated, we trust that there has been some effect; (iii) if only 1% of infected people was detected,in some parts of Italy the infected population would be over 100%. On the other hand, the main point made by this report [14] , i.e. that only a large scale serological study, checking if people have COVID antibodies, will be able to tell how diffuse the infection isand should be performed as soon as possible -is by all means true and correct. See also [15] .[27] This is usually denoted as R0, but we prefer to change this notation in order to avoid any confusion with initial data for the known removed R(t).[28] We tend to use only these two countries: in one case (Italy) the author has a direct knowledge of the epidemic and of different side conditions which may have affected data; in the other case (China) excellent reports by the Chinese CDC and by WHO are available [17, 18] and provide an established view. The situation in other European countries is still evolving too fast -and subject to many side conditions which I do not know -to be reliably analyzed.[29] We stress this depends on the protocol used to trigger laboratory tests; in our general theoretical discussion, this is any such protocol and we want to discuss the consequences of changing this in the sense of more extensive tests.[30] It should be stressed that as each of these \"possible infected\" might have a small probability of being actually infected (depending on the kind of contacts chain leading to him/her from known infectives), here \"isolation\" does not necessarily mean top grade isolation, but might amount to a very conservative lifestyle, also -and actually, especially -within home, where a large part of registered Chinese contagions took place.[31] Direct measurement on the epidemiological data for Northern Italy show that this parameter can be reduced to about 20% of its initial value with relatively mild measures. In fact, albeit the media speak of a generalized lockdown in Italy, the measures have closed schools and a number of commercial activities, but for the rest are ac-",
