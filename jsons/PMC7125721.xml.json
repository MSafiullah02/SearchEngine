            "text": "Polyproteins composed of covalently linked individual proteins with different biological functions are prevalent in nature. For instance SARS coronavirus, the agent that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, realizes its entire proteome from two large polyproteins, each encoded by a long single open reading frame (ORF) [1]. The expressed SARS polyproteins are then processed into the individual functional protein subunits by the action of highly specific proteases also encoded by the ORFs [1, 2]. A further example is human immune deficiency virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The RNA genome of this retrovirus is organized in three major genes gag, pol and env, which encode for polyproteins and undergo proteolytic processing at defined stages during maturation [3]. Recombinant polyprotein approaches mimicking viral polyproteins have recently emerged as a powerful means to express high-value protein complexes for structure determination [4, 5\u2022]. Recently, the long elusive influenza polymerase has been produced successfully from a self-processing synthetic polyprotein, enabling high-resolution structure determination [6\u2022\u2022, 7]. Polyprotein fusions which are not processed by protease, but remain covalently conjoined by engineered linkers have been instrumental to obtain important insight into numerous essential physiological processes including multidrug efflux, co-translational protein targeting or enzymatic processing of chromatin, among others [8\u2022\u2022, 9, 11\u2022, 12\u2022\u2022]. Moreover, single-chain engineering approaches linking protein domains into novel, artificial polyproteins have resulted in new classes of high-affinity binder molecules as potential protein therapeutics [13] and accelerated elucidation of mechanisms governing protein folding by single-molecule techniques [14]. Thus, polyprotein technologies have recently gained prominence as particularly useful tools for unlocking previously often inaccessible protein samples to detailed structural and mechanistic studies, as illustrated in the following. In this contribution, the use of polyproteins in structural biology is discussed, by highlighting recently determined structures of naturally occurring polyproteins on one hand and by reviewing recent structural studies where recombinant polyprotein constructions were utilized on the other.",

            "text": "Polyproteins are used in nature by many viruses to structure their proteome. As a consequence, viral polyproteins are an intense focus of research efforts for numerous reasons [15, 16, 17]. For instance, inhibition by small molecules of proteases that process polyproteins during viral maturation can provide a powerful handle to combat viral disease [2, 18, 19, 20]. In HIV, the physical infrastructure of the virus is provided by the gag gene which gives rise to the precursor Gag (group specific antigen) polyprotein [21]. Viral protease processes Gag during maturation into several proteins and spacer peptides dictating immature and mature viral capsid structure [22]. Maturation is a two-stage process. Precursor Gag polyprotein first forms a hexameric lattice at the plasma membrane of an infected cell. This induces budding and release of immature viral particles. Proteolytic processing of Gag then rearranges the viral structure to the mature form [23]. Inhibition of Gag-processing protease enabled preparation of immature retroviral capsids suitable for structure analysis by electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging methods (Figure 1\n) [24, 25, 26, 27\u2022\u2022]. Comparison of the structures of HIV Gag protein in reconstituted tubular arrays on one hand and in intact virus particles on the other, provided unprecedented insights into the conformational plasticity of this precursor polyprotein [26, 27\u2022\u2022]. The studies also revealed that retroviral capsid proteins can adopt different quaternary arrangements during virus assembly, notwithstanding conserved tertiary structures [27\u2022\u2022].",

TRPs are also produced as large precursor proteins and then processed by proteases into several copies of proteins with similar function. TRPs are made of consecutively arranged repeats of amino-acid stretches. Examples of known TRPs include polyprotein lipid binding proteins of nematodes [28] and filaggrins, which are keratinocyte produced TRPs crucial to health and appearance of skin [29, 30]. The solution structure of a mature, post-translationally processed repeat unit of a TRP, ABA-1A from the nematode polyprotein allergen of Ascaris, was determined, representing the first structure of this class of proteins [31]. ABA-1A adopts a novel fold comprising two juxtaposed four-helical bundles that share a long central alpha-helix (Figure 1). Nematode polyprotein allergens have no known counterpart in humans. The Ascaris ABA-1A structure therefore may serve as a starting point for the development of new drugs and therapeutic intervention strategies against disease states caused by these intestinal parasites.",

Modular polyketide synthases (PKS) and their metazoan homologs, fatty acid synthases (FAS) belong to this class of catalysts [32, 33]. Recently, the structure and function of a modular multi-domain long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase from Mycobacterium avium was elucidated [34]. The crystal structure revealed extensive swapping of functional domains in the holo-enzyme which is a homo-hexamer (Figure 1). Thus, four intertwined protomers are involved in completing one catalytic reaction cycle [34].",

            "text": "The highly successful strategy of viruses to utilize polyproteins to their advantage has found its equivalent in recombinant technology. A synthetic polyprotein, expressed recombinantly in baculovirus-infected insect cells, has enabled the structure determination of influenza polymerase. Despite its common appearance, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the virus that causes influenza has remained elusive. More than 40 years ago, the influenza polymerase was discovered, a key protein complex that replicates the genetic material of the virus [35, 36]. Atomic resolution information on the structure and function of this protein machine is essential, as it may open up important avenues for drug discovery. However, the influenza polymerase remained inaccessible for decades \u2014 to produce this valuable protein complex for detailed analysis, proved to be a seemingly insurmountable technical challenge. This has now changed dramatically with structures of influenza polymerase complex determined by X-ray crystallography [6\u2022\u2022, 7]. These break-through studies provide unprecedented insight into the inner workings of this viral protein machine. This revolution in understanding influenza was brought about by applying a polyprotein strategy to produce influenza polymerase recombinantly, in the quality and quantity required for high-resolution structural and functional analysis (Figure 2\n). The strategy applied recapitulates the mechanism adopted by SARS coronavirus. A single ORF was constructed encoding for a highly specific protease, NIa, from tobacco etch virus (TEV), fused in frame with consecutively arranged PA, PB1 and PB2 subunits of the polymerase. At the far end of the polyprotein, a reporter protein was inserted to track protein production \u2018in real-time\u2019 during expression, by recording fluorescence [5\u2022]. All protein units within the polyprotein were spaced apart by customized linkers containing the specific site for cleavage by the TEV protease, purification tag sequences and spacer residues (Figure 2). The polyproteins encoding for influenza polymerases were successfully expressed with the MultiBac baculovirus insect cell expression system developed for producing multiprotein complexes [37].",

The use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged as a powerful technique to probe protein structure, enabling analysis of the mechanical stability and folding pathway of protein specimens at the single-molecule level. By means of a stretching force, applied through a microscopic cantilever to a biological target fixed to a support and recorded by the deflection of a laser beam, the analyzed protein is unfolded to an extended state (Figure 5\n).",

The muscle protein titin is a prominent example [46, 47, 48]. Titin consists of several hundred repeated protein domains including fibronectin and immunoglobulin-like folds. The use of polyproteins in single-molecule AFM results in considerable improvement of the statistical evaluation of singular domains within the polyprotein chain [14]. This can be exploited in the analysis of homomeric polyproteins that are constructed genetically or by chemical fusion reaction from identical copies of the same protein species of choice. Moreover, in addition to providing a clear fingerprint, polyproteins also have the advantage that a larger number of events can be recorded per experiment as compared to only one event if monomeric proteins are used.",

Artificial polyproteins obtained by singe-chain protein engineering approaches are instrumental to overcome sample production bottlenecks and provide novel means to illuminate biological mechanisms, including folding and unfolding properties at the single-molecule level.
