As our reporter in New York says, new solutions have to be found, since nobody was fully prepared: what we experienced during the peak of the pandemic in New York City during the first week of April collapsed every preparation we had, as the number of patients with acute kidney injury in the setting of COVID-19 was higher than expected (\u2026). The vast influx of patients presenting aggressive metabolic abnormalities (\u2026) rapidly overwhelmed our capacities. As a result we were mandated to come up with strategies to mitigate the burden imposed to our dialysis services. Of all, one of the strategies with high impact and success in doing this was the opening of the acute peritoneal dialysis program.",
