            "text": "Hong Kong has one of the highest densities among megacities in the world. Seven and a half million inhabitants live on a group of islands that total 1000 km2. Hong Kong has a hilly topography; hence, only 25% of the land is built-up areas (Ng 2009). Land prices in Hong Kong have been increasing over the years. For example, in the Central Business District, rent prices have increased 33% between 2005 and 2007 (Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department (HKRVD) 2009). Owing to the limited land area and the increasing land prices, property developers are building taller and bulkier buildings with higher building plot ratios that occupy the entire site area in order to economically cope with the high land costs, as shown in Fig. 2.1. In addition, the Government of Hong Kong has planned the need to deal with an increasing population, which is projected to increase to 10 million in the next 30 years. Seeking ways to optimize the urban morphology of the city is a difficult but important task for urban planners.\n",

The mean wind speeds recorded by the urban observatory stations in urban areas over the past decade have decreased by over 40% (Hong Kong Planning Department (HKPD) 2005). Stagnant air in urban areas has caused, among other issues, outdoor urban thermal comfort problems during the hot and humid summer months in Hong Kong. Stagnant air has also worsened urban air pollution by restricting dispersion in street canyon with high building-height-to-street-width ratios. The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (HK EPD) has reported the frequent occurrence of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO2 and respirable particles (RSP) in urban areas such as Mong Kok and Causeway Bay (Yim et al. 2009). These areas also have some of the highest urban population densities in Hong Kong.",

Since the outbreak, the planning community in Hong Kong started to pay more attention to the urban design process in order to optimize the benefits of the local wind environment for urban air ventilation. As a result, the Hong Kong Government had commissioned a number of studies on this regard; the most important project among the government-commissioned studies is entitled \u201c Feasibility Study for Establishment of Air Ventilation Assessment System\u201d (AVA), which began in 2003 (Ng 2009). The primary purpose of this comprehensive chapter is to establish the protocol that assesses the effects of major planning and development projects on urban ventilation in Hong Kong (Ng 2007).",

Two modeling methods have been frequently applied to study wind environment of the city: wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) conducted numerous urban-scale wind tunnel tests to understand the dispersion of particulate matters smaller than 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) (Ranade et al. 1990). Williams and Wardlaw (1992) conducted a large-scale wind tunnel study to describe the pedestrian-level wind environment in the city of Ottawa, Canada, and identified areas of concern for planners. Plate (1999) developed the boundary-layer wind tunnel studies to analyze urban atmospheric conditions, including wind forces on buildings, pedestrian comfort, and diffusion processes from point-sources of the city. Kastner-Klein et al. (2001) analyzed the interaction between wind turbulence and the effects induced by vehicles moving inside the urban canopy. Wind velocity and turbulence scales throughout the street canyons of the city were analyzed using smoke visualization (Perry et al. 2004). In 2004, the US EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development (EPA-ORD) conducted a city-scale wind tunnel study to analyze the airflow and pollutant dispersion in the Manhattan area (Perry et al. 2004). Kubota et al. (2008) conducted wind tunnel tests and revealed the relationship between plan area fraction (\u03bb\np) and the mean wind velocity ratio at the pedestrian level in residential neighborhoods of major Japan cities. In Hong Kong, the Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility has conducted numerous tests at the city, district, and urban scale to understand the wind availability and flow characteristics of Hong Kong (HKPD 2008).",

Mochida et al. (1997) conducted a CFD study to analyze the mesoscale climate in the Greater Tokyo area. Murakami et al. (1999) used CFD simulations to analyze the wind environment at the urban scale. Kondo et al. (2006) used CFD simulations to analyze the diffusion of NOx at the most polluted roadside areas around the Ikegami-Shinmachi crossroads in Japan. Letzel et al. (2008) conducted studies of urban turbulence characteristics using the urban version of the parallelized large eddy simulation (LES) model (PALM), which is superior to the conventional Reynolds-averaged models (RANS). Using the Earth Simulator, Ashie et al. (2009) conducted the largest urban CFD simulation of Tokyo to understand the effects of building blocks on the thermal environment of Tokyo. Ashie et al. noted that the air temperatures around Ginza and JR Shimbashi are much higher than in the surrounding areas of Hama Park and Sumida River. Ashie et al. argued that the high air temperature can be attributed to the bulky buildings at Ginza and JR Shimbashi that obstruct the incoming sea breezes (Ashie et al. 2009). Yim et al. (2009) used CFD simulation to investigate the air pollution dispersion in a typical Hong Kong urban morphology. In general, using CFD for urban-scale investigation has been gaining momentum in the scientific circle. Two important documents that provide guidelines for CFD usage have been published: Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ) Guidebook (AIJ 2007; Tominaga et al. 2008) and COST action C14 (Frank 2006).",

In this study, only the pressure drag is considered, since skin drag is relatively small and is not a factor that can be controlled at the urban scale. Oke (1987) provided the logarithmic wind profile in a thermally neutral atmosphere, which is a semiempirical relationship that acts as a function of two aerodynamic characteristics: roughness length (z\n0) and the zero-plane displacement height (z\nd). The reliable evaluation of such aerodynamic characteristics of urban areas is significant in depicting and predicting urban wind behaviors (Grimmond and Oke 1999).",

            "text": "Currently, three methods can be used to estimate the surface roughness: Davenport roughness classification (Davenport et al. 2000), morphologic, and micrometeorological methods (Grimmond and Oke 1999). The Davenport Classification is a surface-type classification based on the assorted surface roughness values, using high-quality observations (Davenport et al. 2000), which covers a wide range of surface types. This method is not too helpful to describe urban permeability in high-density cities, because most of the urban areas could only be described in Class 8 \u201cSkimming: City centre (z\n0 \u2265 2)\u201d. Compared with the micrometeorological method, the morphometric method estimates the aerodynamic characteristics, such as z\n0 and z\nd, using empirical equations (Lettau 1969; MacDonald et al. 1998; Raupach 1992; Bottema 1996; Kutzbach 1961). Grimmond and Oke (1999) validated the empirical models by Kutzbach, Lettau, Raupach, Bottema, and Macdonald. While reasonable relationships between z0 and frontal area index (\u03bb\nf(\u03b8)) for low- and medium density forms have been found, there is a tendency of overestimation of z\n0 for higher density cases (Bottema 1996).",

Therefore, to estimate the local roughness of every grid when buildings cross grid cells, a new method of which the cross-section areas (red areas) were included in the frontal areas of the corresponding grid cell was proposed. Compared with the map in polygon units (G\u00e1l and Unger 2009), this new calculation with uniform grid allows an exploration of mapping with a better explanatory power.\n",

Similarly, due to the signature urban morphology of Hong Kong (i.e., high-density and tall buildings), the airflow above the top of the urban canopy layer may not easily enter the deep street canyons to benefit the wind environment at the pedestrian level. Thus, the wind velocity ratio at the pedestrian level mostly depends on the wind permeability of the podium layer. A statistical study was conducted to validate the above assumption by comparing the sensitivities of VR_w,j to changes of \u03bb\nf(z) calculated at different layers. The cross-comparison results are plotted in Fig. 2.12a, b, which indicate that VR_w,j has a higher correlation with \u03bb\nf(z) at the podium layer (0\u201315 m). This illustrates that pedestrian-level wind speed depends on the urban morphology at the podium layer (0\u201315 m), rather than the building layer (15\u201360 m) or the whole canopy layer (0\u201360 m).\n",

Compared with other traditional maps (G\u00e1l and Unger 2009; Wong et al. 2010), the proposed GCR map is more applicable to urban designers and planners due to its accessibility to the planners in the planning process.Local values of some areas may deviate due to the extremely large building widths (large commercial podiums and industrial buildings). In this type of areas, the wind permeability cannot be predicted in GCR. However, the occurrence of this type of extreme examples is very small (approximately 2%).\n",

Compact integrated developments and podium structures with full or large ground coverage on extensive sites typically found in Hong Kong are particularly impeding air movement and should be avoided where practicable. The following measures should be applied at the street level for large development/redevelopment sites particularly in the existing urban areas:providing setback parallel to the prevailing wind;designating non-building areas for sub-division of large land parcels;creating voids in facades facing wind direction; and/orreducing site coverage of the podia to allow more open space at grade.\n\n",

They should be aligned primarily along the prevailing wind direction routes, and as far as possible, to also preserve and funnel other natural airflows including sea and land breezes and valley winds, to the developed area.The disposition of amenity areas, building setbacks and non-building areas should be linked, and widening of the minor roads connecting to major roads should be planned in such a way to form ventilation corridors/air paths to further enhance wind penetration into inner parts of urbanized areas. For effective air dispersal, breezeways and air paths should be perpendicular or at an angle to each other and extend over a sufficiently long distance for continuity.\n",
