The sequences of primers and molecular beacons used in \u2018real-time\u2019 NASBA assays are shown in Table 1\n. Analysis of results was undertaken using the NucliSens\u00ae Easy Q Analyser (BioM\u00e9rieux Ltd) isothermically at 41 \u00b0C and results were available within 120 min. The NASBA assays have been found to be highly sensitive with the Tissue Culture Infective Dose being between 1 to 1 in 10\u2212 5 virus input (TCID50) and 100 to 0.1 copies of synthetic RNA. The assays are also specific with no background signal detected with a cross-reacting panel including a range of respiratory viruses and a lysis buffer negative control. The cut-off threshold for a positive result was defined as 20% above the negative control wild-type signal [22].",

Patients and parents had been asked to score their symptoms using the diary card regularly. The symptoms were scored as 0 for no symptoms, 1 for mild symptoms, 2 for moderate symptoms and 3 for severe symptoms for each criterion. Each patient above the age of 5 years was also provided with a mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter and was asked to record their best of three readings every morning and evening. The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child's usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold [25].

In addition, we have recently shown that influenza vaccination does offer protection against its subsequent acquisition in patients with CF [24] contradictory to a recent Cochrane review [34]. The recent development of intranasal vaccination may be an effective and attractive option as this will offer local protection in the upper airways, which can help arresting infection at an early phase before symptom complications arise.",

Firstly, it is developed specifically for RNA target amplification and is particularly suited for the detection of RNA viruses because there is no need for a separate reverse transcription step, unlike PCR. Secondly, the selection criteria for NASBA primers are less stringent, allowing easier primer design in selected less-conserved regions of the gene [41]. Thirdly, it is a continuous isothermic process that does not require a thermocycler [42], [43]. Hence a constant temperature throughout the amplification reaction allows NASBA to amplify the targeted RNA or DNA exponentially at each step of the reaction. The NASBA reaction is also more efficient than PCR methods that are restricted to binary increases per cycle. Fourthly, background DNA does not interfere with the NASBA reaction, as single-stranded RNA sequences are specifically targeted, unlike PCR where background DNA may cause false positive results [44]. The closed-tube format of NASBA assay greatly reduces the risk of contamination and thus of false positive results. Finally, the detection of PCR products requires gel electrophoresis, which necessitates the transfer of resolved nucleic acid to an agarose gel. This is very labour intensive and time-consuming and is not as well suited for diagnostic use compares to \u2018real-time\u2019 NASBA.",
