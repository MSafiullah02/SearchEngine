            "text": "Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is considered an emerging enteric virus with reported morbidity rates ranging from 10 to 83% and a fatality rates ranging from 7 to 27% in adult horses (Oue et al. 2011; Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015). Clinical signs include pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy, colic and diarrhoea accompanied by leucopoenia secondary to neutropenia and lymphopenia. Recent studies reported the detection of ECoV worldwide in faeces and respiratory secretions of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease (Oue et al. 2013; Pusterla et al. 2013; Miszczak et al. 2014). Coronaviruses are grouped into three different genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus (Woo et al. 2009). ECoV shares the betacoronavirus\u20101 genera together with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and is therefore closely related (Woo et al. 2009). Given the strong homology between BCoV and ECoV, the former could therefore act as a surrogate for ECoV vaccination (Guy et al. 2000; Oue et al. 2011).",

Animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California at Davis. The study horses were deemed healthy based on normal physical examination and haematological parameters. Further, nasal secretions and faeces from every study horse were determined to be qPCR\u2010negative for BCoV and ECoV and all horses tested seronegative against BCoV and ECoV prior to study commencement. Four study horses per group were vaccinated either orally, intranasally or intrarectally using a commercially available modified\u2010live bovine rota\u2010coronavirus vaccine (CalfGuard).1 The vaccine vials were reconstituted according to the manufacturer's recommendations and given either orally, intranasally using a small 6\u2033 nasal cannula or intrarectally using a 10 French 10\u2033 rubber catheter. To increase the vaccine volume and increase mucosal contact, the oral and intrarectal vaccines were diluted each in 50 mL of PBS prior to administration. Vaccinated horses were given a primary vaccination followed by a booster vaccination 3 weeks later (as per the manufacturer's label). Two additional horses remained unvaccinated and served as environmental sentinels. Following the first and second vaccination period, all horses were monitored daily, for 7 days, by means of a physical examination. Further, faeces and nasal secretions were collected daily from each of the study horses for the molecular detection of BCoV via qPCR. Briefly, the qPCR assay used was based on the detection of a specific 93 base\u2010pair product of the N gene of BCoV (GenBank accession number EU401980.1; oligonucleotides: forward primer BCoV\u2010826f CCCAATAAACAATGCACTGTTCA, reverse primer BCoV\u2010919r CACTAGTTCCAAGTTTTAACATTTCTCC, probe UPL #119 TTGGTGGT).",

A standard curve was run for the assay using BCoV plasmids and the amplification efficiency calculated from the slope using the formula E = 101/\u2212s \u2212 1.

This is in agreement with various studies evaluating the safety of BCoV vaccination in cattle (Thurber et al. 1977; Waltner\u2010Toews et al. 1985). The only physical abnormal findings noticed during the study period was mild, transient changes in faecal character in eight study horses. Of those horses affected by changes in faecal character, three were in the intranasal group, three in the intrarectal group, one in the oral group and one control. Without evidence of BCoV faecal shedding in all horses with \"cow\u2010pie\" faeces, and the inclusion of a control, it is probable that the transient faecal character change was related to dietary or environmental factors. During the study protocol, the faecal samples were not analysed for bovine rotavirus which can have a genetic homology with equine rotavirus (Ghosh et al. 2013). Rotavirus can cause severe diarrhoea in foals but does not cause clinical disease in adult horses and therefore was not deemed necessary to test during the study. It is not possible to definitively rule out the bovine rotavirus as a cause of the soft faeces but given the inclusion of a control horse it seems unlikely.",

Seroconversion to BCoV was determined in one horse from each of the three vaccination routes, indicating antigen detection by the immune system. The study investigated alternative vaccine administration routes in order to determine if a serological response could be achieved whilst bypassing the stomach, known to negatively impact avirulent pathogens due to its low pH. Intrarectal vaccine administration of Lawsonia intracellularis in foals has been previously shown to be more effective than oral vaccination, as this route triggered a weak humoral and long\u2010lasting cell\u2010mediated response (Pusterla et al. 2009). The limited number of horses showing a measurable serological response for the various administration routes could relate to the vaccine antigen mass, inability of the vaccine BCoV strain to replicate in equine epithelial cells or pre\u2010existing neutralising cross\u2010reactive antibodies to ECoV. Unfortunately, the study did not measure mucosal or cell\u2010mediated immunity and detection of peripheral antibodies to BCoV alone is not a measure of protection.",

An ELISA has since been created, and the samples were retrospectively tested for ECoV antigens (Kooijman et al. 2016). All samples were shown to be negative for antigens against ECoV, and therefore, there should not have been alteration in the response to the vaccine due to previous exposure to ECoV.

Overall modified\u2010live vaccinations show a significantly higher immunogenicity than inactivated vaccines (Kollaritsch and Rendi\u2010Wagner 2013) but killed\u2010adjuvanted vaccines will trigger a more reliable, measurable immune response, although, mucosal immunity response is still undetermined.
