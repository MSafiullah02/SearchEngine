The unique features of this study include prospective follow-up of preschool/young school age children for 1 year, quarterly nasal sampling when children were well, and inclusion of 3 consecutive respiratory seasons, thereby dampening the effect of year-to-year variation in prevalence of different respiratory viruses. This age group was specifically chosen to determine the rate of sinusitis complicating URI because the frequency of URI is high and the risk of acute otitis media is considerably lower than during the first 3 years of life. Using these methods, viruses were identified in 81% of symptomatic URIs. RV infections were most common, and there was evidence of differential virulence among viruses, even between RV species. Using predefined stringent criteria, sinusitis complicated 8.8% of URIs.",

Wald et al25 examined 0- to 3-year-old children attending childcare and determined the rate of sinusitis following URI to be 6.5%-13%. Marom et al9 reported a rate of 8% in a population of 6- to 35-month-old children who were followed prospectively. In both of these studies, the rate of sinusitis that was reported may have been blunted by the frequency of acute otitis media that is usually managed with antibiotics, which may have prevented the development of sinusitis. Ueda et al,26 basing the diagnosis of sinusitis on radiographic findings, found the rate of sinusitis to be 6.7% in 2- to 15-year-olds with URI symptoms. Two other observational studies of children with URI found rates of 8.3%-17.3% in children presenting to clinic with respiratory symptoms.27, 28\n",

A classic study done in the 1950s, the Cleveland Illness in the Home study, found a rate of 6-7 \u201ccommon respiratory diseases\u201d per child per year in this age group.16 This difference may be explained by changes in societal structure as reflected by an increase in childcare attendance by very young children. Early communal experiences may result in children developing more illnesses earlier in life and fewer illnesses in later years. Three other recent studies provide contradictory results. Revai et al29 and Byington et al20 found a rate of approximately 0.5 illnesses per month in children less than five years of age. These children were followed in a similar fashion to children in our investigation but were younger. In a household surveillance study, Monto et al8 reported a rate of 0.6 URIs per respiratory season in children 5-17 years old. Although children in the Monto study were only followed during the respiratory virus season, it is safe to say that children had fewer than 1 acute respiratory illness per year. These differences almost certainly relate to variation by age group, season, and geography.",

First, by design, the children included in this study were of a fairly narrow age group (4-7 years), as this is the age with the peak incidence of clinical episodes of sinusitis. URIs in infants and older children may have different characteristics and different viral antecedents.9 Second, the population studied was largely Caucasian and well-educated, reflecting the demographics of our Midwestern city. Third, the actual rate of URIs per child may be somewhat higher than we reported. Our study coordinators called families each month to encourage reporting of URIs and samples often were obtained at home visits for the convenience of the participants. Despite these efforts, it is possible that some URIs, particularly those of mild severity, might have been missed. Studies relying on self-report of URIs can underestimate the frequency of illnesses.12 Lastly, nasal rather than nasopharyngeal samples were used to identify viruses, which may have overestimated the rate of RV and underestimated the role of PIV, hMPV, FLU, and RSV.",
