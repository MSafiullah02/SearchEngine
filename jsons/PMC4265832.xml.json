            "text": "Regarding the current EBOV outbreak, it is hypothesized that the index case most likely originated via animal \u2014 human contact (e.g., ingestion of undercooked \u2018bush meat\u2019, animal bite, or inadvertent contact with body fluids or blood from an animal).[17] Following the index transmission event, the predominant mode of the subsequent viral transmission is human-to-human.[18] This is consistent with the previous observations and characteristics of human-to-human transmission.[19] Late in the spring of 2014, the number of reported cases declined, causing medical investigators to believe that the course of this outbreak followed the trajectory of previous outbreaks and that the outbreak's \u2018burnout\u2019 phase had begun.[9] However, within a period of a few months, sporadic cases were being diagnosed beyond Guinea, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, and most recently in the United States and Spain.[92021222324] Some of the reported cases were clearly associated with transmission following a history of travel to the affected regions of Africa.[9202123] In West Africa, the number of new EBOV cases was increasing at an accelerating rate, with a number of factors contributing to this phenomenon, including poorly functioning healthcare, under-developed water and waste management systems;[25] a degree of international complacency;[26] population movement within the affected geographic areas (including rural-to-urban migrations);[2728] increasing urban population density;[29] local cultural factors (e.g., burial customs);[30] widespread poverty;[27] and a lack of responsiveness from the local and national governments.[63132] To make things worse, there was a shortage of physicians in West Africa.[33] For example, before the outbreak, fewer than a 100 physicians were providing healthcare for 4.3 million people in Liberia.[34] The fact that numerous healthcare workers were themselves becoming infected with Ebola (including over a 100 healthcare workers who died as of late August 2014) further complicated the already critical situation.[3536] At the time of this manuscript's initial submission (November 14, 2014) the Ebola outbreak has been contained in Nigeria and Senegal, and there have been no further reported cases in the United States or Spain.[3738] However, a new outbreak in Mali has just been announced.[3940]",

As mentioned previously, passive immunity may be helpful in attenuating the severity of the disease, as suggested by the relatively quick recovery of one of the Dallas, Texas nurses following plasma transfusion from an Ebola survivor.[94] An experimental drug called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, San Diego, California, USA), is also based on the concept of passive immunotherapy, and combines three humanized monoclonal anti-EBOV antibodies that are synthesized in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.[97] Administration of ZMapp in rhesus macaque primates who were inoculated with virulent Ebola strains may have attenuated the disease severity.[97] The drug has also shown some promise after it was administered, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),[98] to several infected individuals; however, its scarcity and lack of substantiating data make it challenging for the agent to reach those most in need.[97] Another drug, TKM-Ebola (Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, British Columbia, Canada), has also been approved for selective use by the FDA, along with ZMapp.[99] Finally, Brincidofovir (Chimerix, Durham, North Carolina), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has been shown to have in vitro activity against Ebola,[100] and has reportedly been administered to patients with EVD in the United States.[101]",

Detailed illustrated guidelines have been provided by the WHO regarding the use of protective equipment and handling of potentially infectious Ebola samples.[115] Any biological specimens or samples obtained from EBOV patients should be collected using adequate personal protective equipment, using closed vacuum containers.[115] The samples should be transported in leak-proof containers and kept separately from other patient samples. For blood work of patients suspected with EBOV, under no circumstances should manual pipetting and open centrifugation be considered. After the laboratory tests are concluded, disinfectants with a higher potency (preferably, 10% chlorine solution) to kill the virus should be used. Elimination of all infectious materials should be conducted according to the prevailing/approved local protocols, rules, and regulations.[116117] It is important to note that the actual approach to biohazardous waste disposal has to take into consideration specific economic-based realities and circumstances across different geographic areas. Pertaining to this, it is critical that adequate training of the medical transportation personnel is conducted, to ensure safe and transmission-free transit of the infected patients and/or infectious materials.[118]",

The governors were the non-technical voices that many citizens felt needed to be heard. There is a basis to state that the fear of Ebola in 2014 seems to be greater than that of SARS in 2003.[149] However, there is evidence from quarantines carried out for the SARS epidemic that quarantine is the most effective, \u2018when it is voluntary, home-based, and accompanied by extensive outreach, communication, and education efforts\u2019.[150] This outbreak is not the first, nor will it be the last, to pit individual civil liberties against the utilitarianism of the general public's health. To add further perspective to the above argument, it appears thus far that Nigeria was able to contain the outbreak by utilizing an immediate and aggressive response to the very first report of Ebola on its soil,[151] while Guinea and Sierra Leone have experienced a resurgence of cases amid claims of complacency.[152] Faced with the most recent outbreak in Mali, government officials are responding with quarantine orders for dozens of potentially exposed individuals.[40]",

Preparing for a funeral in a respectful yet safe way can be done following a few guidelines. First, it is acceptable to bury patients who died from Ebola without washing the bodies. Second, it is acceptable to offer prayers for people who have died from Ebola and bury them while avoiding direct contact with the body and limiting the burial attendance to family and close friends. Third, religious leaders should be intimately involved in the process of containing the outbreak and should work with the local authorities and the community so that appropriate and safe actions are taken with regard to disposition of the bodies.[153155] Finally, governments need to do more to clamp down on the illegal practices of bribing health facility workers in order to recover highly infectious bodies of relatives so that a private burial (as opposed to a cremation or burial in designated public sites) can take place.[156]",

This is further exacerbated by the delayed and underfunded early international response and increased mobility of patients and/or their contacts, who can readily reach large population centers through improved highways, rail systems, and air travel. Finally, there is a relative lack of trust by local populations toward the authorities,[160] which is further exacerbated by the incompatibility between local social customs, the biology of the virus, and the rules of outbreak containment.[84153154] The traditional outbreak approaches used during earlier, smaller Ebola outbreaks will probably not work and will require massive International supplementation. The global community will need to augment local roads, hospitals, supply medical and support personnel, pharmaceuticals, and accelerate vaccine efforts.[3236103161162163164] This needs to be accompanied by a social/media thrust to explain this disease to the affected inhabitants and to \u2018win their hearts and minds.\u2019 In other words, while significant scientific and medical initiatives are needed to stop the outbreak, these efforts will likely be less effective without population-based education and trust-building efforts. Finally, population-based prevention and treatment strategies are desperately needed, involving (among other things) the development of new pharmaceutical agents and vaccines, better diagnostic point-of-care tools that are both rapid and inexpensive, the encouragement of out-of-the-box thinking with regard to enhanced surveillance methods, as well as the concept of readily deployable international rapid medical response teams.[103157165] It is incumbent on the international medical community to not only establish a rapid and effective global response capability to large-scale epidemics and natural disasters, but also to realize the necessity and acceptance of the concept of Global Responsibility and Security for all nations that cannot fend off calamities on their own.[162166]",

Although the likelihood of Ebola becoming an epidemic in high-income countries is very low, there are many reasons for supporting the ongoing efforts in countries of West Africa, the most prominent among which are the duty to provide humanitarian assistance to the people affected, the obligation of global justice and fairness, and the ethical code of conduct inherent to the above.[168] Equally important is the need to minimize Ebola's spread to other potentially vulnerable geographic areas including the densely populated regions in other parts of Africa, East Asia, and the Central and South Americas.[169170] Some have suggested, for example, that an Ebola outbreak in Central America and Asia may be as difficult to manage as the current outbreak in West Africa,[169170] with some government officials openly concerned about lack of resources to effectively deal with Ebola.[171] In fact, some countries in Central America are already reacting to the possibility of Ebola importation, by imposing travel bans and restrictions.[171]",

Aggressive investment for early containment efforts is the wisest and the least expensive of all approaches and the global community should come together at this time of crisis to implement a uniform, well-coordinated strategy to prevent catastrophic human and economic losses that may result from inaction. One of the reasons the current outbreak has been more difficult to contain than the earlier Ebola outbreaks is the spread of the disease to areas of high population density, as opposed to the previously seen rural area incidents, where isolation is easier. This may also be a harbinger of what may happen if the virus were to spread to other developing countries with large cities, where millions of low-income residents live in very densely populated areas (i.e., Bangkok in Thailand, Cairo in Egypt, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Lagos in Nigeria, or Mumbai in India). As part of the global health security strategy, the key preventive interventions must include meticulous infection control in healthcare settings, creating awareness and community support for implementation of containment measures, rigorous enforcement of the existing public health protocols, and ample resources to investigate and document any new chain of transmission. Although isolation of suspected cases is likely to be ineffective or impossible under many circumstances, voluntary quarantine and active surveillance can prove helpful. Given all of the above considerations, the time is now for humanity to act as one unified front, against Ebola.",

Whole-body coverage also makes it less likely for the healthcare worker to accidentally make contact between gloves or other surfaces directly exposed to the virus and any uncovered skin surfaces. For that reason, it is also important that workers be decontaminated before taking off the protective equipment, and that another person observes the removal of the said equipment, to ensure that none of the exposed external surfaces come in direct contact with the healthcare worker's skin during the process",
