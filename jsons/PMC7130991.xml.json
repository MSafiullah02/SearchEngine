However, neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age-distribution of severe cases and deaths or for the geographic and other variations in rates and explosiveness of mortality during the Pandemic. According to Frost [3], epidemiologically, the overall mortality in 1918\u20131919 would be fully explained not by the incidence of influenza infection, but by the incidence of severe pneumonia cases. Therefore an alternative hypotheses to the severity of influenza cases will be addressed here that departs exactly from the epidemiology (time, person, and place) of the influenza mortality.",

            "text": "As a general idea, it is proposed that early-life infection by contemporary circulating influenza viruses results, at the population level, in an acquired immune differentiation of successive birth-cohorts, both by adaptive epigenetic transformations capable of fitting fetal development to a new environmental condition (maternal infection and immune response), and by elimination of those genotypes unable to adapt. (For gene-environmental interactions, see Levins\u2013Lewontin, 1996 [9], and Schmalhausen, 1949 [10]). Immune responses to different influenza sub-types would be less adaptive than to the subtype that originally primed each individual. An extensive literature exists on a phenomenon called influenza \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d, described by Davenport [11] as follows: \u201cIt is now recognized that the major antigens of the strains of first infection of childhood permanently orient the antibody-forming mechanisms so that, on subsequent exposure to related variants of influenza virus, the cohort of the population would respond with marked reinforcement of the primary antibody\u201d ([11], p. 453). Thus, it would be expected that (1) individuals originally primed by different types/sub-types of influenza viruses responded differently to ulterior influenza challenges and (2) due to the changing prevalence of influenza types/sub-types over time, individuals\u2019 priming would emerge, at the population level, as birth-cohort variation in vulnerability to influenza re-infections [12].",

The main characteristic of the 1918 influenza pandemic, besides its enormous mortality toll, was the unusual age distribution of the influenza deaths. While the incidence of respiratory illness was highest in children under 10 years of age, dropping towards ages 15\u201324, rising to a second small peak at ages 25\u201340 and then declining as individuals aged, mortality from influenza and pneumonia was exceptionally concentrated in young adults [3], [13], [14]. Cases-fatality in 1918\u20131919 was higher among the military compared to the civilian population [14]. Other unexplained feature of the 1918\u20131919 Pandemic was the influenza-excess mortality variation across and within countries [14], [15]. Among 40 US cities, Pearl [15] observed that \u201cthere [was] an extraordinary amount of difference between different cities in respect of the force with which they were struck by the epidemic ([15] p.1745)\u201d. The differences could not be accounted for by demographic factors, density of population, geographic position or recent growth of the population. The only factor that was shown to be correlated with the explosiveness of the outbreaks was the usual mortality level prevailing in the cities. Cities with relatively high normal death rates, and particularly ones associated with pulmonary tuberculosis, organic heart diseases and chronic nephritis and Bright\u2019s diseases, had also a relatively severe and explosive mortality from the influenza epidemic ([15], p. 1781).",

Laboratory tests did not keep up with the increase in number of cases. But up until week 30, from 1466 available results, 59% were positive for the new A/H1N1 virus and 14.3%, positive for influenza A seasonal viruses, odds of 4:1.

Significant variations occurred in the geographic distribution of cases and deaths within the State, with areas heavily hit and others completely spared from severe disease and deaths [6].

Co-circulation of a pandemic strain with other influenza viruses would therefore be expected to be small during the summer and highest in the winter. In 2009, the levels of circulation influenza viruses in the US in the summer was unusually high, but 99% of the identified viruses belonged to the H1N1 pandemic strain [20]. In Rio Grande do Sul, in the winter, the new H1N1 co-circulated with seasonal viruses in a proportion 4:1 [6]. Co-circulation of new and seasonal influenza viruses were also documented in Mexico. On May 15, answering a question about the possibility of a new, more pathogenic variant of the H1N1 virus to be circulating in some areas of Mexico, Celia Alpuche, head of the Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE) in Mexico City told ScienceInsider: \u201cWe have seen influenza seasonal strains circulating even more than swine-origin A (H1N1) virus, in particular in areas in Mexico such as Durango, Jalisco, and Zacatecas. We started the subtyping of these strains and we are finding mostly A (H3) seasonal and also A (H1) seasonal\u201d [21].",

Thomas and cols. [25] showed that, after a secondary challenge with a different influenza virus, hidden epitopes may emerge and switch protective immunity to an alternative antibody-mediated pathway.

Serological studies done in the 1950s\u20131960s in the US and in Europe [11], [28] found anti-H2 and anti-H3 influenza antibodies mostly among individuals born until around the turn to the 20th Century, but low levels of H3 antibodies were identified in cohorts born until about 1918 [11] and even 1936 [28], in samples collected before the 1968 Pandemic. Thus, co-circulation of different sub-types of influenza viruses, like happened after 1978, probably occurred also during the beginning of the 20th Century. The much higher level of mortality in 1918 was most likely associated with the very high level of influenza activity documented in the United States [22] and in Great Britain [13] from 1888\u20131890 to the mid-30s.",
