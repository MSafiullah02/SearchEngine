To address this, we set up COVIDsortium (NCT04318314), a bioresource focusing on asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs\u2014doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrators, and others) at Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK, to collect data through 16 weekly assessments (unless ill, self-isolating, on holiday, or redeployed) with a health questionnaire, nasal swab, and blood samples and two concluding assessments at 6 month and 12 months. HCWs were self-declared as healthy and fit to work for study visits. Participants were not given swab results, and those with symptoms or in self-isolation resumed study visits on return to work.",

If our results are generalisable to the wider HCW population, then asymptomatic infection rates among HCWs tracked the London general population infection curve, peaking at 7\u00b71% and falling six-fold over 4 weeks, despite the persistence of a high burden of COVID-19 patients through this time (representing most inpatients). Taken together, these data suggest that the rate of asymptomatic infection among HCWs more likely reflects general community transmission than in-hospital exposure. Prospective patients should be reassured that as the overall epidemic wave recedes, asymptomatic infection among HCWs is low and unlikely to be a major source of transmission.",
