            "text": "In this context, anticancer centres in Africa will face many challenges and uncertainties. Health-care providers might need to make the difficult ethical shift from individual cancer patient management to public health priorities, imposed by these exceptional curcumstances. 1,2 Anticancer resources, especially intensive-care unit beds and human resources, will probably need to be repurposed in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancer centres will therefore be obligated to postpone most cancer treatments. Consequently, anticancer centres should embrace the uncertainties and proactively prepare for this fight through several measures. First, they should prepare at the early stages of the pandemic to receive suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 and cancer, and adopt measures to protect patients only with cancer during treatment who have a higher risk of severe events or death (\u00d7 3\u00b75) than the general population. 1 Second, healthcare workers need to be protected, because, unlike ventilators, they cannot be urgently manufactured or run at 100% capacity for long periods. 3 Third, all major elective surgeries for stable cancers should be postponed to leave intensive-care unit beds free during the peak of the epidemic. Fourth, we propose oncological waiting strategies and a prioritisation of curative and adjuvant treatments over palliative ones to limit the impact on vulnerable patients. 1,4 Finally, specialists in cancer centres should be prepared to manage patients with COVID-19 but not cancer in case the national health-care system is overwhelmed.",
