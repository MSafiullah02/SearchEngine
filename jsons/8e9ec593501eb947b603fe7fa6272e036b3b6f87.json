The cutaneous lesions, caused by the virus, spread to the nervous system creating several complications. Fusion of host membranes with the viral envelope is mandatory and mediated by a group of glycoproteins conserved in all Herpesviridae subfamilies, such as the glycoproteins B (gB), H (gH), L (gL) and D (gD). We investigated the inhibitory activity mediated by synthetic overlapping peptides spanning the entire ectodomains of gH and gL glycoproteins. We have performed a brute analysis of the complete gH/gL heterodimer in order to explore the inhibitory activity of peptides modelled on these glycoproteins against HSV-1 infection. Twenty-four of the gH peptides at a concentration of 150 \u03bcM reached the 50% of inhibition cut-off. Interestingly, they are mainly located in the gH carboxy-terminal domain. None of the gL peptides had a clear inhibiting effect. No peptide toxicity was observed by lactate dehydrogenase assay at the concentrations used in our experimental conditions. HSV-1 therapy is based on acyclovir treatment, but some resistant strains are emerging. In this scenario, innovative approaches for HSV-1 treatment are necessary.

The HSV-1 gB protein (gB) can also bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but the binding is less efficient [16] . Following attachment, gD binds to one of a number of co-receptors on the host cell membrane, including herpesvirus entry mediator, nectin 1, nectin 2 or 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate, resulting in a conformational change in gD [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The conformational change in gD is believed to trigger the formation of a fusion complex, which enables fusion to ensue. The coexpression of gD, gB and gH-gL heterodimer in the same cell results in cell-cell fusion, indicating that these four proteins constitute the minimal fusion apparatus [23] [24] [25] [26] . Although the entry pathways of other enveloped viruses share similar patterns, most systems for which molecular details have been gathered rely on a single fusion protein [27] . HSV-1 is singular because it uses both gB and gH/gL as its core fusion machinery [28, 29] . The gH/gL complex and gB only interact with each other in response to receptor binding by gD [30, 31] and this interaction is required for allowing fusion to occur [32] . The tridimensional structure of gH/gL of HSV-2 showed that the gH/gL heterodimer does not resemble any known viral fusogen, which may support different roles for gH including that of being a fusion regulator through its interaction with gB [33] . A broad literature describes gH as involved in the entry process, for example, certain mutations in the transmembrane (TM) region and cytoplasmic tail affect fusion [34] [35] [36] [37] , as do mutations in the region preceding the TM [38] . Furthermore, peptides matching a number of regions of the gH ectodomain have been shown to interact with membranes and proposed to play a role in the fusion process, probably through regulation of gB activity and/or direct membrane interactions at the fusion site [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . In HSV-infected cells and on mature virions, gH and gL are always found together as an heterodimer, in a stable 1 : 1 complex [33, 48] and rely on one another for proper folding, post-translational processing and transport to the cell and virion surface [49] [50] [51] [52] .

The chosen threshold for including into the category of putative inhibitory peptides was dictated by the general high concentration needed for exerting an antiviral activity of HSV-derived peptides. Previous works have shown that concentrations of peptide ranging from 10 to over 150 \u03bcM are needed to inhibit HSV infectivity. Nevertheless, the results obtained prove that peptide-based strategies targeting regions of the proteins with predictable structures or motifs represent a valid option when searching functional regions of a protein; in fact, our whole protein scan confirmed as regions of interest several domains which were already found to posses some antiviral activity based on their structural characteristics. Peptides H85, H87 and H88, spanning the region of gH from 446 to 485, partially overlap the helical peptide previously named H-HR1 (aa 444-479) able to reduce infectivity in a consistent manner, albeit at the high concentration of 250 \u03bcM [64, 67] . Peptides H94, H95, H97 and H119, H120, H121, H122 and H123 overlap peptides gH493-537 and gH626-644, which were found able to inhibit HSV entry with approximately 60% of inhibition at 250 \u03bcM. Hydropathy analysis based on the hydrophobicity-at-interface scale proposed by Wimley and White [66] enabled the detection of these two domains of HSV gH able to induce rapid membrane fusion and inhibit viral entry. A shorter peptide gH493-512, corresponding only to the N-terminus of gH493-537 and almost completely overlapping H94, H95 and H97 of the present work, was able to inhibit HSV entry even more effectively [45] . Finally, peptides H145 and H146 at the extreme C-terminus of the gH ectodomain (the TM helical domain starts at aa 804) have been previously individuated as being part of a larger pre-TM domain with the ability of inhibiting virus infectivity, and a peptide previously named pTM6 [44] exactly corresponds to peptide H146 of the present study. Nevertheless, the remaining peptides have been newly identified and presented an inhibitory activity above the set threshold.

However, an activity without a specific molecular target can be envisaged for many entry inhibitor peptides. These peptides, albeit being derived from viral surface proteins, do not belong to well-known HR domains, but are often scattered in exposed regions of surface proteins or in domains that may only become exposed following conformational modifications triggered by binding of viruses to receptors or by environmental changes inside endosomes. The current understanding of the mechanisms of action of these peptides finds a hallmark in their propensity for membrane binding due to their interfacial hydrophobicity or amphipaticity [44, 45, 64, 68] . In view of this characteristic, peptides could hamper virus entry by establishing direct physical interactions at hydrophobic interfaces on membranes or fusion proteins. Essentially, peptides can bind membranes, membrane proteins or virus particles, thereby exert a steric hindering effect on the early stages of viral penetration such as viral binding and/or membrane fusion. Sometimes, they can interfere with fusion protein modifications by premature initiation of the fusion proteins, which become unable to promote fusion once the peptides are bound to the viral envelope membrane. In this study, we have described an alternative approach for identifying functionally important regions of HSV-1 gH and gL, showing for the first time the HSV-1 inhibition activity of unreported peptides derived from gH protein. The approach involved the synthesis of two libraries of overlapping peptides that encompassed the entire ectodomains of gH and gL. Brute-force scanning approaches have proved to be of interest for analysing proteins of several viruses; in fact, potential antiviral peptides against hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been discovered by screening 441 overlapping peptides (18-mers) covering the entire HCV polyprotein [69, 70] . Eleven peptides with strong antiviral activity were identified. The most active inhibitory peptide, called C5A, showed significant hydrophobic and membrane binding propensity and was suggested to directly interact with the HCV viral envelope blocking infection when treating viruses during or prior to the initial entry stage. Interestingly, C5A was also able to inhibit HIV by disrupting the integrity of the viral envelope [71] . Following this line, four proteins considered to play a role for promoting HCV entry (namely: CD81, scavenger receptor B1, claudin 1 and occluding) were analysed by an overlapping 18 amino acid peptide scanning strategy, and out of 113 peptides, two of them derived from claudin 1 showed potent inhibitory activity against HCV infectivity [72] . Furthermore, HCV has also been recently analysed by screening a peptide library covering the full-length E1 and E2 amino acids sequences where a peptide from the E2 stem domain was found to block cell entry of HCV peseudoparticles at nanomolar concentrations. This peptide is of sure potential interest because it proved to be efficient against the major HCV genotypes from 1 to 6 [73] . Another study assessed the activity of 95-overlapping peptides (15-mers) covering the entire VP1 capsid protein of Enterovirus 71, an important human pathogen which may cause severe neurological complications. In this case, the strategy proved to be also usable for searching potential peptide inhibitors in non-enveloped viruses, with the discovery of four peptides able to inhibit EV-71 infection by more than 80% [74] . A further study described a 10-mer overlapped peptide library synthesized by combinatorial approach where a peptide derived from the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could block the binding to the cellular receptor and, thus, the entry into target cells [75] . Bai et al. [76] used a phage display methodology to identify a peptide (named P1) to inhibit West Nile virus (WNV) infectivity, possibly by binding to the envelope glycoprotein (E protein) necessary for membrane fusion. A modified version of P1, named P9, showed a strongly increased inhibitory activity against WNV at micrometre concentrations, and, more interestingly, entered the brain by crossing the blood brain barrier to reduce infectivity in a mouse model of brain infection. Moreover, an interesting study sparkling from the observation that HIV patients co-infected with the common and asymptomatic GB virus C (a virus related to HCV) present lower HIV viremia suggested the analysis of overlapping peptides from the E2 protein from the GB virus C and allowed the identification of two peptides able to inhibit HIV in vitro by their competitive binding at the gp41-gp120 interface [77, 78] . Also, HSV glycoproteins have been analysed by a peptide scanning strategy. A library of overlapping 15-mer peptides encompassing the ectodomain of gB was synthesized and tested for HSV infectivity inhibition [79] . Seven of the peptides inhibited infectivity by 50% or more when tested at 100-\u03bcM concentrations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 888, "end": 891, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 896, "end": 899, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2133, "text": "[69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2137, "text": "70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2569, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2915, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 3299, "end": 3303, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 3722, "end": 3726, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 4062, "end": 4066, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 4080, "end": 4084, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 4960, "end": 4964, "text": "[77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 4965, "end": 4968, "text": "78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 5179, "end": 5183, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, many of the antiviral peptides identified by these brute force approaches overlap with many peptides discovered by analysing hydrophobicity at interface scales [68] . The example of HSV gB is remarkable, because all the peptides (at least the most active) had also been previously described as membraneinteracting [80] sequences using the WWIHS 66 . Our results, scanning the entire sequences of HSV-1 gH and gL, confirm that the WWIHS is a powerful mean to identify potential antiviral peptides, but some regions of potential interest can remain underscored; therefore, a systematic analysis of the whole sequence by overlapping peptide libraries can add more detailed information on the regions involved in inhibition. In fact, we were able to detect four areas where peptides could be grouped for their antiviral activity. Some of the identified regions overlap with peptides already described which were discovered by bioinformatics tools, thereby strengthening this clear relationship between the function and the physiochemical character of peptides. In particular, the four identified inhibitory areas are mainly located in the regions of the glycoprotein named H2, while only a small area (S4) is located in the H3 region. The H2 domain of gH is mainly characterized by a bundle of helices and a few extended regions. In gH derived from Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a synthaxin like bundle (SLB) is present in this region [81] , and this motif has proved to be of importance because its disruption can lead to impaired replication activity of the virus [82] . Interestingly, one of our inhibitory peptides is located in the HSV-1 gH corresponding region. Surprisingly, we did not detect any activity in inhibition assays when testing gL derived peptides. This may likely account for the negligible role of gL in membrane interactions. Nevertheless, also domain H1 of gH which is mainly devoted to interact with gL did not provide any inhibitory peptides. H1 sub-domains clamp gL like tongs and make extensive contacts between the interacting highly complementary surfaces. In fact, the two proteins need each other to fold correctly and gL is a powerful scaffolding protein for gH. The inability of gH peptides derived from the H1 domain to function as inhibitors of infectivity can be explained by the fact that the formation of the highly stable complex between the two glycoproteins happens during the maturation and egress from the infected cell; therefore, the structure is already definitive when the heterodimer becomes expressed on the mature virion envelope. Disruption of the gH:gL interaction is not likely to happen because the whole H1 domain would result in an unfolded structure in absence of gL. The four areas of active peptides are depicted in Figure 5 where the filled surface of the protein is shown. It is of interest to note that inhibitory areas S2, S3 and S4 are mainly occupying regions of gH domains H2 and H3 and are exposed to the external surface of the protein, while only area S1 is partially buried inside and only partially exposed to the outside. Therefore, this observation is consistent with the minor inhibitory activity of peptides belonging to area S1. Furthermore, inhibitory area S4 precedes the C-terminal TM domain of gH and is part of the C-teminal H3 ectodomain mainly composed of \u03b2-sheets which constitute a large patch of hydrophobic residues able to interact with the cell membrane during the fusion process or modifying the curvature of the viral envelope.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 179, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1446, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1577, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2782, "end": 2790, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Membrane fusion is an important step in enveloped virus entry into host cells.
