However, the test has several limitations and a sensitivity of only 30\u201370% at initial presentation; additionally, a negative RT-PCR does not rule out COVID-19 [1]. Chest radiographs (CXRs) and computed tomography (CT) have been widely used for evaluating COVID-19 patients. However, CXRs have low sensitivity (20%) and may appear normal during the early stage of the disease and therefore are not recommended as the 1st line imaging tool [2].",

As the disease progresses, the consolidations can extend diffusely giving a \u201cwhite lung\u201d appearance accompanied by air-bronchogram sign. During the recovery stage, following treatment, the consolidations reduce in size and density, having a ground glass appearance. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy are rare [5].",
