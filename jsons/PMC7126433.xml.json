The duration of the epidemic in Hong Kong was 105 days. This paper focuses on modelling the transmission of SARS within Hong Kong during this period. International travel networks facilitated the further spread of the virus to other cities. The effect of the SARS coronavirus was damaging both economically and socially and was indeed tragic for some individuals. Given the impact and widespread concern a virus such as SARS causes it is important for government and officials to make informed decisions regarding measures to deal with the virus and so reassure the public. Such measures might include quarantine, and questions about what type of quarantine and when to apply such a quarantine require answers and risk assessment. Furthermore, as the outbreaks in the Prince of Wales Hospital [1], [2] showed, even hospitalization cannot be considered an effective quarantine, nor could demanding people stay in their buildings, as the peculiarities of the virus spread in the Amoy Gardens Housing Estate demonstrated [3], [1].",

Nonetheless, it is clear how our methods can be readily generalized to include more complicated heterogeneous models. To focus our discussion we adopt an existing model [5]. This epidemiological model [5], [6], in which an infection is mediated via a contact network with so-called \u201csmall world\u201d properties [7], has been shown to exhibit many of the features characteristic in the SARS epidemic spread in Hong Kong. In particular, a small number of individuals showed a great propensity to infect others, so-called \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d (e.g., Ref. [8]).",

The use of MCMC to fit stochastic epidemics is not new but since Small\u2019s small world disease model is probabilistic, MCMC appears to be a most useful methodology to attempt parameter fitting. For such network models as are employed here, however, the likelihood functions are complicated and often intractable, and so standard MCMC algorithms, which require explicit likelihood functions, cannot be applied. Instead, we turn to a form of MCMC called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [10] which instead relies on model simulation and realization. Summary statistics are used to compare simulated data from the model with the observed data; when the summary statistic is sufficient and the values from the simulated data exactly match those from the observed data, samples are obtained from the exact posterior distributions of the model parameters. When no sufficient statistic is available, acceptable parameter values are drawn from an approximation of this distribution.",

The motivation for this model is that the near-neighbour links provide a model of infection within households and between adjacent households. In a dense urban environment such as Hong Kong, it provides a model for the spread of contagion among families based on residential units. However, in an effort to simplify (and homogenise) the model structure we do not build separate family units into our model, rather, we assume that individuals residing in close proximity to one another are likely to spread an infection between them.1\nIn addition to spread in residential environments, we build a random number of long-range links into the model. These long-range links account for the fact that individuals are free to move within in the community and will therefore have direct contact with others in different residential locations. We feel justified in using a random and long-tailed distribution for these connections (rather than the fixed number associated with the regular grid) because the number (and diversity) of contacts an individual will have will vary greatly between individuals. Moreover, the probability of infecting near neighbours (considered to be members of the same household) is likely to be distinct from the probability of infecting remotely-linked neighbours (say, daily acquaintances).",

Three phases of the epidemic are captured by including change-points for the infection rate p2 and the removal rate r1, reflecting stages of intervention in the crisis. In the first phase SARS spread freely and so we have a relatively high p2 and low value for r1. As rudimentary hygiene measures were introduced, the value of p2 will fall, and as a quicker response time in hospitalizing suspected cases developed r1 would rise in value. In a third phase, where very strict control measures and increased public awareness were prevalent, we consider an even smaller value of p2 and a higher value of r1. The actual changepoint models for p2 and r1 used by Small and Tse [6] were p2=p211(t\u226430)+p221(30<t\u226460)+p231(t>60)r1=r111(t\u226420)+r121(20<t\u226440)+r131(t>40) where t is measured in days and 1(\u22c5) is an indicator function, p21, p22 and p23 are values for the parameter p2 in different time periods, and r11, r12 and r13 are similarly related to r1. We note that in our inference experiments we shall only attempt to estimate plausible distributions of the rate parameters while preserving the changepoint (time) values as used by Small and Tse [6]. In principle, ABC-PRC can be used to also estimate these, for example, Ref. [13] considers a changepoint model for analysis of DNA segmentation.",

Here, unknown model parameters and data are assumed to be random variables and one is interested in the posterior distribution of the parameters given the observed data.

If, for notational convenience, we represent the model parameters as \u03b1 and the data as D then mathematically the posterior is given by (1)\u03c0(\u03b1|D)\u221dL(D|\u03b1)\u03c0(\u03b1). We can use the posterior distribution to obtain quantities of interest. For example, the mean value of the parameters is given by (2)\u03b1\u02c6=\u222b\u03b1\u03c0(\u03b1|D)d\u03b1. Such integrals, however, are analytically intractable for most applications, and so must be numerically approximated. An effective method of approximation is to draw samples, \u03b1n, from the posterior in such a way that \u2211n=1N\u03b1n/N converges to the integral for large enough N. Markov chain Monte Carlo is an effective way of sampling from the posterior using only the terms on the rhs of (1), i.e., without knowing the constant of proportionality, and algorithms such as Metropolis\u2013Hastings (MH) dictate update rules.

Since the system is such that Pr(x\u2217=D)\u22480, we must use a summary statistic, and so choose one which allows for such stochastic variation whilst preserving the gross features of the data which we wish to represent. Consider, for example, the case when the peak is offset by only one or two days while other aspects of the data are well-represented, a case in which we may wish to accept the generating parameters. To allow for such variation, we have chosen S to be a moving-average filter, thus allowing comparisons to be made between smoothed versions of the observed and simulated data sets. Fig. 2 shows the actual data in blue and a smoothed version with a window size of 10 in red. This is the S(D) we compare our realizations S(x\u2217) to using \u03c1 as Euclidean distance. This choice of S and \u03c1 allows us to accept parameter values which produce data sets matching the trajectory of the data without being overly sensitive to the exact realization obtained via simulation.

As we proceed through the course of the epidemic the long-range transmission rate falls and the removal rate rises. A final point of observation is the apparent correlation between the transmission rate p1 and the network parameter for acquaintances \u03bc. There appears to be a negative correlation between these two parameters, however, whether or not this suggestion is fact requires further simulation at ever lower tolerances, with correspondingly longer computation times. We can see from Fig. 5\nthat the distribution of accepted errors at \u03f5=40 suggests we can lower the tolerance still further but at the expense of ever more simulated realizations of the model.",

The model in question has been shown to be capable of capturing the behaviour of the observed case data seen in the spread of the SARS-CoV outbreak in Hong Kong during 2003 [5]. The model is probabilistic both in terms of the mode of transmission between individuals and the connections between individuals. In particular, individuals are assumed to be connected, and hence capable of transmitting the virus, to a fixed number of close neighbours (relatives) and a small number of more distant individuals, the latter number being identified from an exponential distribution. This leads to a small world network model of the connections between individuals and consequently the possible transmission vectors for the disease.",

We obtained estimates of the small world network parameter \u03bc and the various transmission probabilities between the compartments in the population, i.e., r0 the probability at which exposed (prone) individuals become infectious, r1 the probability at which an infected individual is removed from the population through effective quarantine, recovery or death, p1 the probability at which an infectious individual infects a close susceptible neighbour, and p2 the probability of an infectious individual infecting a susceptible long-range linked neighbour.",
