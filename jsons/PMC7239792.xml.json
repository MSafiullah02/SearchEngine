[1] As of May 12th, 2020, there were more than 4,218,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 216 countries, areas, and territories, and over 290,000 people have lost their lives. [2] The number of cases and deaths rises continuously and rapidly every day. Even worse, the biggest challenge is that there are no proven therapies or vaccines against COVID-19, and there are significant research gaps in many other essential research and innovation areas. As one of the earliest affected countries, the outbreak in China has been well controlled, and it is nearing completion. Many countries and international organizations affirmed that China took active and effective measures. Chinese counterattacks can be replicated to fight the epidemic. [3] Among them, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an irreplaceable role and provided unique advantages in the management of this disease. Nevertheless, the underlying action mechanisms of Chinese medicines (CMs) are still unclear. In this paper, the possible action mechanisms of CMs in controlling COVID-19 were reviewed and analyzed. This outcome will help us to understand this disease more, develop effective methods to treat this disease, and benefit the world to control this disease.",

[14] Lou [15] reported that the change of hematology is positive in COVID-19 patients treated with TCM. A prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial also confirmed the efficacy of Lianhua Qingwen capsule in ameliorating the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients, including fever, fatigue, and cough.[16] Several retrospective and controlled clinical studies have also reported that TCM treatment effectively improved the fever, sweating, cough, headache, shortness of breath, chest distress, nausea, and diarrhea in COVID-19 patients. [[17], [18], [19], [20]] The chest radiogram has been improved significantly as well.[21] The levels of ESR, CRP, and IL-6 were significantly decreased, and the level of IFN-\u03b3 was increased in the group received both TCM and conventional treatments in comparison with the group only received conventional treatment (antibiotics and antiviral therapy). [22] TCM was also helpful to the elderly [23], children [24], and severe COVID-19 patients [25,26].",

The overall concept and treatment methods are based on syndrome differentiation, which is the most significant and essential feature. In China, doctors are recommended to use different CMs and strategies for the prevention, treatment, and recovery of COVID-19 at its different stages. The frequently used CMs for COVID-19 are summarized in Table 1\n.[[27], [28], [29]] At the press conference on COVID-19 of the State Council of China, three-medicines and three-decoctions of TCM (TMTD), i.e., Jinhua Qinggan granules, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Xuebijing injection, and Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huashi Baidu decoction, Xuanfei Baidu decoction were emphasized for their remarkable clinical effects in controlling COVID-19 during this epidemic. [15] Especially, Lianhua Qingwen capsule (granules) and Huashi Baidu granules have been officially approved for reliving the fever, cough, and fatigue of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients by the China State Drug Administration recently.[30,31] According to TCM theories, these medications have five different functions, i.e., treating exterior syndromes, resolving dampness, clearing heat, replenishing deficiency, and resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma. [32] According to the medicinal properties of CMs used at different stages of COVID-19, the possible mechanisms of CMs for mild cases could be antiviral and symptom relief, for moderate cases could be anti-inflammation and immune regulation, and for severe and critical cases could be antiviral, inhibiting cytokine storm, and protecting target organs. However, the exact mechanisms must be predicted, analyzed, and validated by network pharmacology analysis, animal studies, and eventually clinical trials. In this article, we mainly summarized and analyzed the possible action mechanisms predicted by network pharmacology analysis from others and us for these CMs that have been used in clinics with reported efficacies recently, including TMTD and others.",

However, ACE2 is also a cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. [68] The combination of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 [69] disrupts the balance between Ang \u2160/ Ang \u2161 and Ang (1-9)/Ang (1-7), thereby generate many free radicals, which can change the permeability of cell membranes and lead to the organ damages. ZHOU [70] speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect type \u2161 alveolar epithelial cells through ACE2, thus destroying the lung tissue and air-blood barrier. Then, the virus continued to infect other organs through ACE2, such as the heart, kidneys, and liver by blood circulation. It further triggered an excessive immune response, such as the imbalance of T-helper-1 (Th1) and Th2 cells, which produced numerous inflammatory cytokines, causing a cytokine storm and leading to MODS ultimately. CMs can play a direct or indirect role in protecting target organs by inhibiting the binding of the virus to ACE2 to produce anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-fibrosis, and expectorant action [71].",

The results of these researches could reflect more on the unique features of individual formula and medication and less on the general features of these formulae and medications. To understand the general features of these formulae and medications, we selected TMTD to screen the common components and then analyzed the targets and signaling pathways that these components may act on using networking analysis. The common components of TMTD were generated by using the SymMap database (https://www.symmap.org/) and TBtools software (V0.665). The results (Fig. 2\n) shows that there are total 401 compounds in TMTD, of which ten compounds are shared by the six formulae of TMTD, they are ursolic acid, thymol, sucrose, rutin, physcion, oleanolic acid, caffeic acid, \u03b2-terpinene, \u03b2-sitosterol, and \u03b2-elemene. We believe that the common action mechanisms of TMTD also lies in these ten compounds. Therefore, we further predicted the possible targets and signaling pathways that the ten compounds may act on by network pharmacology analysis. The results shown that the potential targets are FGF2, BCL2L1, MAPK8, IL6, SRC, JUN, PTGS2, IL1B, FOS, CASP3, REAL, VEGFA, CDK2, TP53, NFKBIA, CDKN1A, CSF2, CASP9, CAT, STAT3, CCND1, CASP1, FASLG, CASP8, and INS and the possible signaling pathways are apoptosis, NOD-like receptor, FoxO, Toll-like receptor, p53, MAPK, cytosolic DNA-sensing, RIG-I-like receptor, VEGF, and Jak-STAT signaling pathways. We also constructed a network to demonstrate the relationship among formulae, component Chinese medicines, active compounds, possible targets, possible signaling pathways, and possible action mechanisms with Cytoscape3.8.0 software (Fig. 3\n). The network shows that the common action mechanisms of TMTD in the treatment of COVID-19 could be related to signal transduction, immune system, and cell growth and death.",

Existing clinical data, in silico study, and literature analysis confirmed that the possible mechanisms of CMs were antivirus, anti-inflammation, immune regulation, and organ protection through multiple components acting on multiple targets at multiply pathways for the treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the current understanding of the mechanisms of CMs is mainly produced from virtual simulation through molecular docking and network pharmacology analysis. The focus and strategy in different research are somehow different; the ingredients, targets, and pathways predicted in these researches might have certain limitations. To confirm these predicted mechanisms, well designed in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal studies based on these predictions are needed. Importantly, the multiple omic technologies, such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, should be applied to analyze the biofluid and tissue samples collected from COVID-19 patients who received TCM treatment in well designed and controlled clinical trials to verify these mechanisms [72].",
