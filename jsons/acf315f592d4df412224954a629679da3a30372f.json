            "text": "In December 2019, a rapidly spreading coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China [1] . Currently, the disease has emerged as an explosive epidemic in many countries, showing the characteristics of a global pandemic. Whole-genome sequencing results show that COVID-19 is classified under the betacoronavirus 2B family because of its typical coronavirus family characteristics [2] , of which the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are well known to people because of their previous outbursts. The genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 showed more than 80% identity with SARS-CoV and 50% identity with MERS-CoV [3, 4] . While the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, current evidence suggests its transmission from bat to humans through a potential intermediate host [5] . Autopsy results show that inflammatory storms play an important role in the pathological changes of the disease. The latest reports show that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are significantly reduced [6] . The most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include sputum production, myalgia, headache, and diarrhoea [7, 8] .",

Early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment are essential to cure the disease and control the epidemic. Serum antibody detection is of great significance in the diagnosis of infected patients, especially for patients with negative nucleic acid test. Simultaneous detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies helps to identify the stage of the infectious. Generally, the antibody profile against SARS-CoV has a typical pattern of IgM and IgG production. The SARS-specific IgM antibodies appeared in about two weeks after infection, and disappeared at the end of week 12, while the IgG antibodies last for months or even many years [9] . For COVID-19, however, the longitudinal pattern of the antibodies remains unclear. We performed this study to investigate the potential relationships between immune antibodies and disease progression.",

Serological surveys can aid the investigation of an ongoing outbreak and retrospective assessment of the attack rate or extent of an outbreak. In cases where there is a strong epidemiological link to COVID-19 infection, paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phase) is another key evidence for the diagnosis of infection. The antibody detection is simple and repeatable, with a low risk of infection for medical staff during the process of sample collection and detection, and thus is an important way of rapid screening.",

This patient's IgM antibodies appeared in about 4 days post disease onset, the time of which was earlier than SARS-specific IgM antibodies that appeared in about two weeks after infection, and disappeared at the end of week 12 [9] . This finding highlights the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 importance of collecting the serum sample of COVID-19 patients as early as possible. However, the titre of IgM antibody is usually low, and lasts for a short time. Contrarily, IgG production indicates the middle and later stages of infection or previous infection, along with high concentration, longer duration, and higher affinity. When IgG in a patient during convalescence is 4 times or higher than that in the acute period, it indicates recurrent infection. Among the 7 patients who were tested for serological antibody within 10 days after onset of the illness, 2 were negative for IgM antibody. These subjects might be in the 'window period' of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During this period, it is difficult to detect the antibody. The advantage of nucleic acid detection over serum antibody detection is that it shortens the detection window of infection.",

In our study, patients were detected positive for IgM by enzyme immunoassay to nucleoprotein as early as 4 days, the time of which was consistent with the observation shown that IgM can be detected 3-6 (median 5) days after onset of CoVID-19 symptoms [12, 13] . However, IgG in our design was seen 6-8 days after disease onset, earlier than that is detected 10-18 (median 14) days after onset of symptoms [12] . Tan et al. reported that the antinucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after disease onset [14] . However, antibody to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein was detected a median of 11 days after onset of symptoms, but the timing of seroconversion did not correlate with clinical course [13, 15] . Moreover, studies in patients with SARS and MERS suggest that antibody responses for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are not durable [16, 17] A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 samples tested 6 years after SARS-CoV-1 infection [19] .
