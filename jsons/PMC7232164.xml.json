With a genome of the new virus sequenced, scientists learned that this virus is closely related to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This discovery, however, leads to other questions. How different are the proteins of SARS-CoV-2, its main functional building blocks, from those of SARS-CoV? Does the new virus target the same proteins in human cells as the known coronaviruses? Most importantly, can the currently developed SARS or MERS antiviral drug candidates or other promising compounds be used to treat the new infection? This study lays out the first 3D roadmap of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their functional complexes, enabling scientists to answer the above questions. The roadmap can be used to streamline the search for new antivirals and vaccines.",

In spite of the instantaneous reaction by the scientific community and extensive worldwide efforts to address this health crisis, vaccines may be months and even years away [4,5]. For instance, a Phase I trial for a vaccine that treats SARS was announced in December 2004, two years after the disease outbreak [6]. Additionally, a vaccine against MERS, another infectious outbreak of the related coronavirus that emerged in 2012, was patented in 2019, with Phase I trials introduced in the same year [7,8]. Nevertheless, in the past two decades, a massive amount of work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the coronavirus evolution and infection, develop effective treatment in forms of both vaccines and antiviral drugs, and propose efficient measures for viral detection and prevention [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Structures of many individual proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins have been explored along with the experimental testing of the anti-viral properties of small-molecule inhibitors [16,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31].",

The answer lies in the use of the modern bioinformatics methods that can drastically streamline knowledge discovery by quickly providing important insights about possible molecular mechanisms behind infection, pinpointing likely protein targets for the anti-viral treatments, and predicting the efficacy of the existing antivirals developed for other coronaviruses. By leveraging previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structures and functions, bioinformaticians have been successfully assisting virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host proteins, and providing other important biological insights. In particular, a plethora of results has been achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [32,33]. In addition to the global structural genomics, an initiative that focuses on determining the 3D structures of individual proteins on a genome scale [34], as well as to the specific efforts aimed at rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses [35,36,37,38], multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein\u2013protein interaction complexes [39,40,41], facilitate structure-based drug discovery [33,42,43], infer protein functions [44], determine the macromolecular interaction network [45,46,47,48], and provide molecular insights into the viral evolution [49,50,51].",

These functional sites, combined with an evolutionary sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related human SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus proteomes, provide us with a structure-based perspective of the evolutionary diversity of SARS-CoV-2, and allow estimation of how similar the function of SARS-CoV-2 virus is when compared with SARS-CoV.

In total, structural templates for 17 proteins were chosen (Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). In some cases, several independent templates, each covering an individual protein domain of a target SARS-CoV-2 protein, were selected.

The information in the interactome would help one understand the global mechanistic processes of the viral molecular machinery during the viral infection, survival within the host, and replication. With this knowledge, one could discern the protein interactions that were crucial for transmission and replication. These interactions could then be potential candidates for inhibitory drugs [60].

In addition, the networks were pruned for duplicate edges, and a network topology analysis was performed to compute a set of summary statistics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and other important characteristics) that characterized the three networks. Finally, the 200 putative interactions were annotated based on the extent to which the protein binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were altered, compared to their SARS-CoV homologs. Based on the evolutionary conservation analysis of the putative protein binding sites extracted from the modeled complexes, some interactions were annotated as potentially disrupted.",

Our search resulted in three new homologs of ORF8 not reported in UniProt that were originated from three different isolates of bat SARS-like coronavirus: bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank ID: MG772933, collected in 2017), bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank ID: MG772934, collected in 2015), and RaTG13 (GenBank ID: MN996532, collected in 2013).

The viral proteins exclusively formed all the hubs, with a few of specific interest. ORF9b was one of the largest hubs in the network thought to play a secondary role only in intra-viral interactions and not necessary for replication [61]. However, a recent study showed that ORF9b hindered immunity by targeting the mitochondria and limited the host cell responses [74]. Nsp8 was the other major hub, which interacted with other replicase proteins, including two other hubs, Nsp7 and Nsp12, which together played a crucial role in replication [75].",

The same interaction was also inferred from structural modeling between SARS-CoV-2 wS and ACE2. Surprisingly, it was recently established that the interaction was preserved [76], in spite of a number of mutations in the receptor binding site of wS. Similar to SARS-CoV [77], wS protein in SARS-CoV-2 was expected to interact with type II transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) [78] and was likely to be involved in the inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, wS remained an important target for vaccines and drugs previously evaluated against SARS and MERS, while a neutralizing antibody targeting the wS protein could provide passive immunity [79]. In addition, there were seven interactions from SARS-CoV determined by structural characterization of the protein complexes that were predicted to be either conserved or potentially disrupted in SARS-CoV-2 (green edges in Figure 6). An important target for vaccines was the surface (S) protein which was evaluated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the idea that a neutralizing antibody targeting wS protein could provide passive immunity for SARS-CoV-2 [79]. We also structurally modeled interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 wS protein and three human monoclonal antibodies that were previously studied in SARS-CoV for immunotherapy and mapped the information about the evolutionary conserved and diverse surface residues. We found that two interactions of wS, with mAb 396 [71] and mAb 80R [72], were likely to be disrupted due to the heavily mutated binding sites while another interaction, with Ab G2 [73], was likely to be disrupted due to a novel insert into the wS sequence. Together, these findings may provide structure-informed guidelines in the search for potential antibody treatment.",

Second, by providing a comparative analysis between the new virus and its closest relatives from the perspective of protein- and ligand-binding, we hope to help experimental scientists in their deciphering of the molecular mechanisms implicated in infection by the new coronavirus as well as in vaccine development and antiviral drug discovery.

First, the extended peptide sequence newly introduced to wNsp3 between two structurally and possibly functionally independent domains of this protein, might act as a long inter-domain linker, thus extending the conformational flexibility of this multi-domain protein. Second, the presence of the four novel inserts and one highly variable region of the surface protein wS and the analysis of this large-scale sequence change with respect to intra-viral and viral\u2013host interactions lead us to conclude that these inserts might have structural impact on the homo-trimeric form of the protein as well as impact the functions carried out by the NTD domain. Third, the structurally modellable repertoire of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome also points to the interesting targets for structural biology and hybrid methods. For instance, the whole structures of the multi-domain proteins wN and wNsp3 could be resolved by integrating comparative models of the individual domains with the lower-resolution techniques that cover the entire protein, such as cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM). The structure of wNsp3 is especially interesting because of the presence of the novel peptide introduced between the two structural domains of the protein.",

However, the near-perfect conservation of the human ubiquitin-aldehyde protein binding site on the surface of wNsp3 is rather intriguing, suggesting the critical role of this interaction in the functioning of SARS-like coronaviruses. Lastly, the conservation of the ligand-binding sites for many putative inhibitors previously developed against SARS and MERS suggests the development of antiviral drugs as a promising direction for addressing this new global health threat.",
