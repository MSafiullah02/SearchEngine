            "text": "The concept of infection control and prevention in veterinary medicine outside the surgical suite or epidemic disease control/eradication in livestock populations was more or less unheard of until the last 1 or 2 decades. During that time, there has been a paradigm shift, such that veterinary infection control is a growing discipline that is becoming part of the customary way in which veterinarians practice medicine. This shift is seen primarily in large academic teaching hospitals associated with specific veterinary schools and in specialty clinics dedicated to advanced diagnostics and care for animals. However, the nature of medicine and mission of veterinary hospitals are such that animals clinically affected by the agents that have the potential to spread among the hospital population, as well as subclinical carriers that may go unrecognized, are always likely to be present in veterinary medical facilities, regardless of size or specialty. The standard of care at every veterinary hospital should include a high level of hygiene, awareness of the dangers of transfer of infectious agents between both animals and people, and procedures to reduce infection risk wherever possible. Such infection control procedures are intended to prevent (limit) introduction and spread of infectious diseases within a group of patients and their human caregivers, thereby, protecting human, animal, and environmental health against biological threats. This article provides an overview of environmental considerations in infection control rather than an exhaustive review. There are numerous excellent resources that cover various aspects in greater detail, many of which are referenced in the following sections.",

The latest published figures from human medicine in the United States suggest that in 2011, 722,000 patients contracted HAI in acute-care hospitals, more than half of which were acquired outside the intensive care unit (ICU).1 These infections resulted in 75,000 deaths and constitute the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.2 Although they may be artificial constructs, when these numbers are averaged out over time, they indicate that on any given day in the United States, 1 in 25 patients has at least 1 HAI, and every day of the year, 205 people die from HAIs. As shocking as these figures are, stringent control efforts instituted over the last 2 to 3 decades in human medicine, which were formalized in 2008,3, 4 seem responsible for an apparent decline in rates of HAI compared with the 1970s to 1990s, during which approximately 2 million HAIs were estimated to occur each year and were, in turn, associated with 100,000 annual deaths.2, 3, 4 In 2011, the most common HAIs included central line\u2013associated bloodstream infections (54,500), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (30,100), surgical site infections (53,700), and Clostridium difficile infections (107,700).1, 2 The pathogens principally associated with these infections include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter, norovirus, and most recently, carbapenemase producing enterobactericeae.2 HAIs are estimated to account for $40 billion in excess health care costs each year.5\n",

Although there was variability between hospitals, when these differences were controlled for, of the 297 horses in the study population, 19.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5\u201326.7) were reported to have had at least 1 nosocomial event during hospitalization. Equivalent proportions for 1535 dogs were 16.3% (95% CI, 14.3\u201318.5), and of 416 cats, 12% (95% CI, 9.3\u201315.5) had at least 1 nosocomial event. In both horses and small animals, the most commonly reported syndrome was surgical site inflammation, with intravenous catheter site inflammation and urinary tract inflammation being the second most common in horses and small animals, respectively. In addition, in a published survey of biosecurity experts at 38 VTHs,12 31 (82%) hospitals reported the occurrence of a nosocomial disease outbreak in the 5 years before the survey interview. Although most of these outbreaks were associated with large animal facilities, there are also published reports of HAIs and outbreaks in small animal clinics.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 There is more than enough evidence to indicate that, as in human medicine, HAIs in veterinary hospitals are a part of the world in which we live. Although certain issues, the principal pathogens, and thus the control measures may differ, it is nonsensical to imagine that reality for veterinary medicine is any different from human medicine, in that HAIs exist and must be subject to control measures.",

However, just as data on veterinary HAI are not readily available, the relationship of environmental contamination with most of these pathogens to HAI is not well defined. Nevertheless, as with human medicine, the link between HAIs and the environment of veterinary clinics is becoming more clear. There are numerous descriptions of environmental contamination associated with HAI in large animal hospitals,19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals, where we conduct routine environmental surveillance for Salmonella, we have many examples directly correlating infection in animals (both community associated and HAI) with environmental contamination (Dr H. Aceto, unpublished observations, 2004). In addition, recently documented MRSA events in veterinary settings showed that environmental contamination ranged from 1% to 12%,24, 25, 26, 27 and there are reports of contamination of the environment and equipment in small animal hospitals with enterococci many of which were multidrug resistant (MDR).28, 29 One of these studies28 investigated the hypothesis that cage doors, stethoscopes, thermometers, and mouth gags used in participating hospitals would have bacterial contamination that could contribute to HAI. This investigation was accomplished by determining the prevalence of surface contamination with enterococci at 10 different veterinary hospitals. Because the locations within the hospitals that were sampled had direct patient contact, it is perhaps not surprising that they all yielded enterococci at 1 or more hospitals. To compare cleaning protocols with bacterial contamination, a veterinarian at each hospital was asked to complete a questionnaire. Results showed that only half of the hospitals had written standard operating procedures for hospital cleaning, and the wide variety of disinfectants used precluded examination of any relationship between cleaning and contamination. Moreover, 5 of 10 veterinarians surveyed reported almost never or never cleaning their stethoscopes, and there were also deficiencies in the cleaning of cage doors, thermometers, and mouth gags at some hospitals.",

            "text": "The physical environment can affect many facets of veterinary care, including patient comfort, patient stress, patient and staff safety, staff effectiveness, quality of care, and patient susceptibility to disease. Effective C/D are critical in preventing transmission of infectious agents between patients or from contaminated environments. To aid in this process, it is desirable that surfaces in animal housing and clinical spaces are cleanable and nonporous. This strategy can be as simple as ensuring that wood surfaces are properly sealed and painted or more complex by eliminating furniture and finishes that are not easily disinfected or, in the worst case, those that are essentially not cleanable by standard C/D methods. Furniture and finishes may include carpeting, upholstery, and unfinished or damaged wood surfaces. In a veterinary hospital, in which fecal material and respiratory or other secretions are abundant, frequently defy containment, are more likely to harbor pathogens, and may represent an HAI risk, cleanliness of treatment/procedures spaces, animal housing, and operating rooms is crucial. This necessity is particularly true in critical care and isolation units, where exacting evaluation of all surfaces, construction materials, and equipment is essential to maximize cleanability, environmental safety, and efficient operation of the area. Such considerations should influence the choice of materials and finishes for all kinds of surfaces (eg, floors, walls, benches and work surfaces, doors and frames); solid, nonporous surface materials that are highly durable and with as few seams as possible are best. For example, in personnel areas, such as nursing stations, seamless, highly cleanable and exceptionally durable poured epoxy floors, although more expensive, are preferable to materials such as vinyl tile. Wherever seams are present, regular maintenance to ensure their integrity or that of other interfaces between surfaces is essential. Block walls should be sealed, with urethane-based paints, for example. Although metal doors and frames are nonporous and may be the ideal, some composites are also suitable. Any wood surfaces must be properly sealed and painted. For all materials, regular inspection and maintenance are a must. To facilitate cleaning, there should be adequate provision of drains. Drains should be connected to the sanitary system, and, to limit future disruption for the conduct of work to replace corroded drains, use of stainless steel drain hubs should be considered to prolong the life of the drain in the face of water, cleaners, disinfectants, and animal urine. The choice of heating and ventilation systems and the location of heaters and air vents are all critical components in facility design. Although this factor may be most obvious for the control of pathogens classically considered to be transmitted via the airborne route, it may be less obvious that organisms normally thought of as fecal-oral can be greatly impacted by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Impacts can be both in terms of contaminating the system and in terms of the system facilitating pathogen spread via, for example, forced hot air systems that circulate contaminated particulates widely throughout a given space. It is imperative that engineers with knowledge about airborne transmission be involved in the design of HVAC systems for veterinary facilities, particularly isolation units.",

The steps in a typical practical C/D procedure of broad environmental application are shown in more detail in Box 2\n, with an emphasis on critical concepts such as dilution rates and contact times for disinfectants. The steps provided are suitable for high-level C/D but are readily adaptable to more low-level C/D needs. Some, but not all, disinfectants have good cleaning in addition to disinfecting properties, so the basic number of steps can be reduced in noncritical areas (to determine whether a particular disinfectant product has adequate cleaning properties inspect the manufacturer\u2019s label). However, where areas are grossly dirty, a separate detergent step is always required. In addition, some disinfectants require rinsing, because of the potential for toxicity or surface damage, but others may have residual activity, which might be negated by rinsing. The need for rinsing and claims for residual activity are also stated on the product label. Drying after C/D is always beneficial to pathogen control. Characteristics of each disinfectant product, including their compatibility with detergents and other chemicals, can be determined by careful inspection of the label, so it is important that individuals responsible for both choosing and using these products understand how to read the manufacturer\u2019s label.36 More information on characteristics of disinfectants is covered in the section on choosing a disinfectant.Box 2Example of an effective, broad-application, environmental C/D protocol\nHave all material safety data sheet or product safety data sheets for C/D materials available and follow instructions for proper mixing, disposal, and personal protective equipment (eg, gloves, eye protection).In the case of animal cages, remove all bedding (if intended for reuse, place in receptacle and send for laundering) and any organic material before cleaning. In other areas, remove any loose organic material (eg, feces, feed, hair, linens, bandage or other materials) before cleaning.Clean surfaces with an anionic detergent. Scrubbing of surfaces is often necessary to remove biofilms and stubborn organic debris, especially in animal housing areas.Rinse with clean water. For all rinsing and product application procedures, care must be exercised to avoid overspray. Unless equipment is moved to a dedicated cleaning area, high-pressure washing should generally be avoided. Higher pressures can help remove stubborn organic debris, but may also force debris and organisms into crevices or porous materials, from which they can later emerge, and they cause more aerosolization and overspray, which may spread organisms widely, even into previously uncontaminated areas. For methods not involving hoses see Box 3.Allow to dry or at least ensure that the bulk of surface water is removed. If excess water remains, subsequently applied disinfectants may be diluted to the point of inefficacyApply disinfectant solution and allow the appropriate contact time. A dilute solution (1:25\u20131:50) of household (4%\u20135.25%) bleach with at least 15 minutes contact time is readily available and inexpensive but may not be the most effective choice. Many other options are available. Alternatives include accelerated hydrogen peroxide (eg, Accel TB [Virox Technologies Inc, Oakville Ontario, Canada]), quaternary ammonium disinfectants (eg, Roccal-D [Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ], Parvosol [Hess and Clark Inc, Randolph, WI]), peroxygen-based disinfectants (eg, Virkon-S [Sudbury, Suffolk, UK]/Trifectant [Vetoquinol, Fort Worth, TX]), or phenolics (eg, 1-Stroke Environ [Steris Corp, Mentor, OH], Tek-Trol [Bio-Tek Industries Inc, Atlanta GA]). Dilution rates and recommended contact times vary by product and are critical to efficacy; be sure to read the product label carefully and follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Although not suitable for use in all areas, metered hose-end sprayers or foamers (eg, HydroFoamer/Sprayer [Hydro Systems Co, Cincinnati, OH]) are efficient delivery methods and generally ensure accurate dilution. Foamers might enhance surface contact.Rinse thoroughly with clean water (although some disinfectants indicate that rinsing is unnecessary, it can prevent residue build-up over time).Allow the treated area to dry as much as possible. Drying is important to achieve maximum effect; allow area to dry as much as possible (completely is preferred), before reintroducing animals or reusing the area. If postcleaning environmental samples are being collected, the area must be completely dry.In known contaminated or high-risk areas, a second application of disinfectant with, for example, an accelerated hydrogen peroxide product should be considered as a final decontamination step. Ensure appropriate contact time, rinse with clean water, and allow the treated area to dry as much as possible, as stated above.\n",

A preliminary step in establishing an infection control program should be an evaluation of the level of HAI risk and how risk averse you want to be in your practice. The risk evaluation process helps guide the nature and stringency of the infection control procedures to be adopted. Because infection control measures are generally associated with some cost, consideration should also be given to how the risk/benefit ratio of these procedures is assessed (the latter might require evaluation over time). Disinfection protocols, for example, should be frequently reviewed and if necessary altered based on evidence gathered through patient and, potentially, environmental surveillance. In addition, there is ample evidence that, in addition to antimicrobial resistance, microorganisms can be resistant to disinfectants, antiseptics, and sterilants, either constitutively, through acquired means, or by formation of biofilms.44 Keeping abreast of developments in antimicrobial resistance helps in determining the need for change.",

A particular disinfectant may be more costly at the outset but overall might be a prudent choice, because of minimal destruction of equipment or damage inflicted to surfaces over time. If prolonged use of a disinfectant is found to damage surfaces, an alternative should be sought, because loss of surface integrity defeats the object of maintaining sealed, cleanable surfaces in critical areas. The use of prepackaged wipes containing disinfectants such as accelerated hydrogen peroxide or quaternary ammonium compounds is a convenient means of disinfecting hand surfaces and certain types of delicate equipment. Clippers, clipper blades, bandage or suture scissors, thermometers, mouth gags, laryngoscopes, endoscopes, and all other equipment used on patients should be subject to appropriate C/D.

In addition to the typical C/D protocol outlined in Box 2, steps in the 3 basic methods for performing environmental C/D are shown in Box 3\n.Box 3Outline of basic cleaning methods\n1.Dry method\u2022Use of dust-retaining materials (ie, microfiber cloths; microfiber cloths and mops have shown superior microbe removal to other materials like cotton, particularly when used with a detergent cleaner) rather than traditional brooms or rags, to minimize the dispersion of contaminated dust in the environment\u2022When cloths are used for damp cleaning, only clean water should be used; no additional detergents are needed\u2022All cloths should be washed after every use\n2.Wet method\u2022Double bucket technique: first bucket is for clean water and either detergent or disinfectant; second bucket is for clean rinse water\u2022Single bucket technique: solution must be changed as soon as it becomes dirty and before moving to any new area\u2022All mop buckets should be emptied, cleaned, and left to dry when not in use. Mop heads should be changed a minimum of once a day or sooner when visibly soiled\n3.Terminal method\u2022Personnel conducting the process must use appropriate personal protective equipment (eg, gloves, disposable apron, eye protection) when indicated\u2022Discard all disposable items according to proper waste disposal regulations\u2022Remove portable equipment to dirty utility area for C/D or sterilization as needed\u2022Place all laundry into an appropriate bag, seal before removal from the space, and send for processing\u2022Dry dust patient area, beginning at the top and working toward the bottom (although walls are not considered particularly critical surfaces in human medicine, the fact that veterinary patients may regularly lick those surfaces as well as floors increases their importance in veterinary infection control)\u2022Wet dust patient area, beginning at top and working toward the bottom\u2022Wash mats, caging or animal housing areas, surgical and examination tables, and other static equipment with detergent and water, rinse, and dry\u2022If disinfection is required (mandatory for infectious patients), apply appropriate disinfectant solution to any/all areas, allow contact time, rinse, and dry\u2022Use special procedures for static equipment that cannot withstand treatment with water and detergents\u2022As needed, repeat washing and disinfection of floors\n\nData from Refs.36, 49, 50, 52, 53",

Veterinary hospitals should consider this approach and, as mentioned earlier, establish an infection control individual/group, which in the context of C/D ideally includes individuals responsible for C/D of the facilities, clinical representatives, and other relevant stakeholders. In addition to instituting C/D protocols, this group should be prepared to educate other staff to ensure buy-in at all levels and promote compliance. Although not widely adopted in veterinary medicine, auditing of C/D is a means of checking practice against a standard or desired outcome and it has been used to improve health service in human medicine.54, 56 The infection control team should be encouraged to develop and conduct audits of C/D. The NHS materials include some sample cleaning standards and audit score sheets that are eminently adaptable to veterinary use. Cleaning standards for a few selected items are shown in Table 1\n. Elements for consideration of cleaning standards can be divided into 3 overlapping major groups: environment, direct contact, and patient equipment. In terms of the environment, there are several subgroups: floors; fixed assets; electrical appliances; toilets, sinks, and other washing facilities; and furnishings and fixtures; examples of which are indicated in Table 1. Issues to be considered when designing and implementing an audit process include frequency, personnel, methodology, sampling, scoring, and action. For human hospitals, personnel involvement and scoring systems can be complex. However, for most veterinary applications, audits could be conducted by an individual or, better yet, a small group, which comprises medical personnel and individuals responsible for C/D. Whoever conducts the audit should be able to competently judge what is acceptable in terms of cleanliness and infection prevention and control. Once the elements and standards criteria to be included in the audit have been identified, the scoring system could be as simple as acceptable (score 1) or unacceptable (score 0) for each element in a given space of a functional area (see later discussion), leading to an overall score for that area. Based on the number of elements scored, the area score can be converted into a percent acceptable. As a guideline, the NHS system uses the following percentages as targets for the 4 functional risk areas described later: very high, 98%; high, 95%; significant, 85%; low, 75%; areas with scores lower than this are considered for predetermined remedial action.",

            "text": "There are numerous chemical agents available to disinfect health care facilities. These agents are mostly liquid based and fall into 9 broad categories: acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkalis, biguanides, halogens (hypochlorites and iodine-based iodophors), oxidizing agents, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Accelerated hydrogen peroxide products (eg, Accel, Virox Technologies, Oakville, ON, Canada), which claim virucidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, and tuberculocidal activity, have been introduced recently for disinfection of noncritical environmental surfaces and equipment. In addition, there are some newer disinfectant combinations that have synergistic actions (eg, Siloxycide, Preserve International, Reno, NV), a combination of hydrogen peroxide plus silver nitrate; the latter provides extended peroxide stability, and the combination claims increased efficacy compared with products containing only hydrogen peroxide; this combination is approved for use in health care settings. Quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combinations (eg, Synergize, Preserve International; Reno, NV) were developed for use in livestock facilities and have been successful, but they are not approved for use in veterinary hospitals. There are also newer technologies, such as no-touch methods of surface disinfection.7, 48, 49 These methods include ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide dry-mist or vapor (HPV) fogging procedures.49 Both can be used for whole room decontamination and are more suited to occasional use either in response to a specific problem or as part of a program of thorough disinfection of specific spaces scheduled to occur at predetermined intervals. HPV is capable of killing a wide range of pathogens, including Cryptosporidium and \u223c6 logs spores, whereas UV is reliably biocidal at 3 to 4 logs against vegetative bacteria. No animals or people can be present during the decontamination process. The use parameters for both are sensitive and require specialized equipment, representing a considerable capital investment, but unlike HPV, UV systems need no additional consumable products. Room decontamination is rapid with UV (\u223c15 minutes) compared with 3 to 5 hours for HPV. In addition, for HPV, the HVAC system must be disabled and the rooms sealed to prevent unwanted dilution of the vapor, which requires considerable staff time. HPV is uniformly distributed throughout the room via an automated dispersal system and is particularly useful for disinfecting temperature-sensitive or complex equipment and furniture. It has been speculated that over time HPV might cause damage to sensitive electronics as a result of microcondensation, but this should not be an issue with the dry-mist form. HPV leaves no toxic residues (aeration units convert HPV into oxygen and water), and it requires no rinsing. Similarly, UV systems generate no residues and are not associated with health and safety concerns, but the environmental penetration of these systems is probably less than HPV. Neither procedure removes dust or stains, so the area must be clean before decontamination. Although these systems have been used widely in human medicine, there are no data to show whether or not the incidence of HAI decreases.49 Other no-touch methods increasingly being used include self-disinfecting surfaces impregnated with heavy metals (eg, copper and silver) or germicides (eg, the bisphenolic compound triclosan). At our large animal hospital, we have successfully used silver-impregnated sticky mats (Dycem, Warwick, RI) in place of footbaths in main entry areas to our high-risk isolation and colic facilities as well as the entry way to the necropsy facility. Although we have not encountered specific problems with these mats, which are sampled weekly for the presence of Salmonella, it is well known that bacteria (particularly gram-negative organisms, including Escherichia coli) can be resistant to heavy metals by both intrinsic and, in some cases, acquired mechanisms. Five mechanisms of intrinsic resistance have been described that allow bacteria to survive in the presence of inhibitory or microbicidal concentrations of toxic metals44 Bacterial resistance to biocides such as triclosan can be intrinsic or acquired by mutation or plasmid or transposon acquisition and can be via several mechanisms: exclusion; efflux mechanisms; mutation to decrease target sensitivity; or target overproduction.44 The likelihood of resistance development should always be considered when choosing products, particularly because some items, such as the mats mentioned earlier, are expensive. Antimicrobial surface coatings based on nanoparticles are under development for both biomedical devices and environmental surfaces57, 58 and may have the advantage over microbicidal coatings based on metals or agents, such as triclosan, because they have prolonged activity, and some seem unlikely to be associated with the development of microbial resistance.57 Steam disinfection systems offer an alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants and can kill a diverse group of pathogenic organisms in seconds, but they are not suitable for all surfaces and introduce additional safety considerations.",

Therefore, individuals responsible for developing C/D protocols must learn to discretionarily pick and choose disinfectants based on the properties of the disinfectant, the perceived challenges of the task, and desired results of the disinfection procedure. For example, the disinfectant that might be chosen for a footbath or foot mat is likely different from the agent picked for general purpose C/D, because the footbath must be quick kill and preferably stable in the face of organic debris. Quick kill and lack of surface damage tend to be mutually exclusive characteristics. Even in the case of routine surface disinfection, procedures should not make for slippery floor surfaces, cause films to build up over time, or damage surfaces (film build-up and surface damage preclude effective cleaning). Although footbaths are not used as commonly in small animal compared with large animal clinics, they may be effective in preventing the transmission of infectious agents.59, 60, 61, 62, 63 While opinions about the degree of efficacy vary, in the absence of other control methods, their use should certainly be considered in isolation areas, particularly if it is short-term, without attendant management problems.Box 4Characteristics of an ideal disinfectant\n1.Broad spectrum: wide antimicrobial spectrum (including sporicidal), should have kill claims for the pathogens that are the common causes of HAIs and outbreaks2.Fast acting: high germicidal activity, rapid kill and short kill/contact time listed on the label3.Remains wet: surfaces stay wet long enough to meet listed kill/contact times with a single application or meet wet times recommended by evidence-based guidelines4.Not affected by environmental factors: stable and effective in the presence of organic matter (eg, blood, feces)5.Chemical compatibility: should be compatible with soaps, detergents, and other chemicals encountered in use, such that the effectiveness of neither chemical is affected, and that mixing does not result in toxicity, increased corrosiveness, or other reactivity6.Nontoxic: not irritating to user, other staff, clients, or patients. No induction of allergies (especially asthma and dermatitis). Disinfectant toxicity ratings are danger, warning, caution, and none. Ideally, choose products with the lowest toxicity rating7.Surface compatibility: be capable of penetration without destruction, proven compatible with common surfaces and equipment found in veterinary settings8.Persistence: sustained antimicrobial activity or residual postapplication antimicrobial effect9.Easy to use: ideally available in multiple forms (eg, wipes, sprays, concentrates); simple directions for use with information about PPE as required10.Acceptable odor: odor and aesthetics should be acceptable to users and others11.Economical: costs should not be prohibitively high but when considering the costs of a disinfectant product capabilities, cost per compliant use, and so on should also be considered12.Solubility: soluble in water13.Stability: stable in concentrate and use dilution14.Cleaner: good cleaning properties15.Nonflammable: flash point higher than 65.5\u00b0C (150\u00b0F)\nData from Refs.37, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50",

Iowa State\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Public Health Web site46, 47 is a valuable and trusted resource in the veterinary community; it gives the spectrum of activity of the major disinfectant groups against various microorganisms and the characteristics of selected disinfectants in accessible readily understood tables.47 The susceptibility of various microorganisms and the level of disinfection required to kill them are summarized in Table 2\n, and the characteristics of the most common disinfectants are shown in Table 3\n. As mentioned earlier, for each chemical disinfectant, the manufacturer\u2019s label36, 37 provides important information, including about microorganisms against which it has been shown to be effective, appropriate contact time, correct dilutions for the desired outcome (may be higher for bactericidal activity and lower for bacteriostatic claims, and different for parvicidal activity vs routine use), as well as other factors that may alter effectiveness of the agent. These other factors can include the length of time that a product remains effective when diluted; shelf-life of the concentrate; temperature range in which it is maximally effective; water hardness (because dilution rates of some disinfectants [eg, quaternary ammonium compounds] may vary depending on hardness of the water); interaction with detergents (which can alter the pH of a disinfectant and reduce its effectiveness); features of the surface to be disinfected (as previously mentioned, integrity of the surface, or lack thereof, can greatly affect disinfectant effectiveness); and organic load (Box 5\n).Box 5Additional considerations in choosing cleaners and disinfectants\nA surface cannot be properly disinfected if it is not clean. A plain, anionic detergent should be chosen as a basic cleaner for animal housing and handling areas, including surgical suites.Cost is important but should not be the only consideration; efficacy, ease of use, and potential deleterious effects must be part of the equation.Make sure that the properties of all of the cleaners and disinfectants that you chose are compatible (eg, avoid combinations that lead to generation of chlorine gas).Potential negative effects of disinfectants on equipment, personnel, and the environment. For example, prolonged use of some disinfectants, particularly powerful oxidizers such as the peroxygens, can damage surfaces (notably metals other than stainless steel, concrete, and tile). Loss of surface integrity defeats the object of maintaining sealed cleanable surfaces and makes cleaning more difficult.Some disinfectants cause a surface film build-up over time, particularly around footbaths/mats but even with general use. Films can be slippery, can impede proper cleaning, and may promote biofilm formation. Although not widely used in small animal practice, footbaths/mats may be necessary in isolation units. Careful siting of footbaths/mats or changing disinfectant may avoid potential problems.Prepackaged disinfectant wipes can be useful in C/D of delicate equipment and hard surfaces in sensitive areas. In general, accelerated hydrogen peroxide\u2013based wipes are preferred over those containing quaternary ammonium compounds.\nData from Refs.37, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50",

In a veterinary clinic, this waste may include but is not limited to animal tissues, bodily fluids and waste, carcasses, cleaning and laboratory chemicals, general medical waste, radiographic by-products, medications, chemotherapeutic agents, batteries, and solvents. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has excellent resources available to guide the appropriate disposal of solid wastes generated by the veterinary industry and has developed categories for them (Fig. 1\n).67 Complete definitions of each of the categories are available at the AVMA Web site.

Even in the absence of active surveillance of the environment, monitoring of the clinical status of patients can be a helpful indicator of when both patients and the environment require closer scrutiny.12 It should be the responsibility of designated infection control personnel to adjust the intensity or focus of surveillance (active or passive), based on developments in the hospital, the picture of disease prevalence in the referral area, literature, and so forth. In concert with these considerations, individual hospitals need to determine characteristics of their case population (size and type, critical care vs elective, both of which have been associated with increased risk),12 level of risk aversion, cost-benefit analysis, and so forth, either before initiating a surveillance program or, just as importantly, evaluating an ongoing infection control program.

Although evidence-based choices for large animal hospitals are straightforward, the options for small animal clinics are less clear. In this context, although still useful in evaluating the effectiveness of C/D, the value of measuring organisms like generic E coli to assess HAI and overall effectiveness of infection control programs is increasingly questioned. Potential targets include MDR pathogens of concern, microorganisms causing the most significant problem in your facility, or evidence from multi-institutional surveys, but further research is necessary to provide veterinarians with better guidance. For these same reasons, some advocate using non\u2013culture-based techniques, such as fluorescent tagging, because they are not tied to specific pathogens.42 If specific pathogens are identified as targets, in addition to classic epidemiologic measures for the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of detection methods, another critical characteristic of testing that should be considered is speed to return of results. In terms of the environment, if it takes days to get results, there could be wide dissemination to patients and other parts of the hospital before corrective measures are initiated. These considerations explain the move away from traditional culture methods to more rapid techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, which often offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity, as well as greater speed.",

The standard of care at every veterinary hospital should therefore include a high standard of hygiene, awareness of the dangers of transfer of infectious agents between both animals and people, and procedures to reduce infection risk wherever possible. It is becoming increasingly clear that the environment of health care facilities is subject to contamination with pathogens and plays a role in at least some HAIs. Consequently, environmental management, with or without active surveillance, should be a component of risk reduction designed to limit HAIs. Effective C/D procedures are critical in preventing transmission of infectious agents between patients or from contaminated environments. Development of well-understood protocols and schedules for C/D, waste disposal, and environmental maintenance to ensure that surfaces remain sealed and cleanable is important. Education of veterinarians and all staff as to the need for thoroughness and vigilance when it comes to C/D is critical to successful mitigation of HAI risks.",
