Previous studies in children have demonstrated mild nasal symptoms following SPN colonisation however when adjusted for age this relationship was weak[9]. Other studies have reported a relationship between symptom severity, pneumococcal density and pneumococcal/viral co-colonisation in children[10]. Pneumococcal colonisation may cause nasal symptoms in two ways; the bacteria could induce host secretions and inflammatory responses or in co-colonised individuals (pneumococcus and virus) due to viral proliferation inducing rhinitis[9]. Some studies have concluded that the presence of respiratory viruses and/or other bacteria within the nasopharynx are the main cause of symptoms; this colonisation in turn increases the rate of pneumococcal colonisation[9].",

Ethical permission was granted by local NHS Research and Ethics Committee (REC) (11/NW/0592 Liverpool-East, date 11/10/2011). This study was retrospectively registered on the ISRCTN database (ISRCTN85403723) as this was not a mandatory requirement at the time of recruitment. All ongoing and related trials for this intervention are now prospectively registered with ISRCTN. Exclusion criteria included natural pneumococcal colonisation at baseline, any chronic medical condition or regular medication (study participation could put the participant at increased risk of pneumococcal disease) and regular contact with an at-risk individual such as young children (study participation could put the at-risk individual at increased risk of pneumococcal disease).",

The carriage rate of pneumococcus in this study was 30.4% and all with SPN6B. This is higher than the \u2018natural rate\u2019, due to the artificial introduction of the bacteria directly into the nasopharynx. This SPN 6B (BHN418) is known from epidemiological studies to have a very low prevalence in the community, therefore the participants are unlikely to have been exposed to it previously. The carriage rate for those inoculated with 23F was 0%. The reasons for the variability in carriage rate between serotypes is unclear but thought to be related to the evasion of mucociliary clearance, host nutrient availability and niche competition[8].",

This particular serotype is not thought to be present in the community and therefore it is very unlikely that the participants would have pre-existing immunity from previous exposure. A previous study suggested that the presence of symptoms could be dependent on the serotype of pneumococcus[17]. The authors reported that colonisation with serotype 19F was strongly associated with symptoms such as coryza, sneezing, cough and expectoration. However, these children were recruited from a paediatric hospital emergency room, the study did not report on the diagnosis given to these patients therefore upper or lower respiratory infection may have been the cause of these symptoms rather than solely SPN colonisation[17].",

Interestingly, 40% of asymptomatic children (low SNOT score) were in fact SPN colonised. However, when the data was analysed considering age, the association between SPN colonisation and SNOT scores was weak (p = 0.06) whereas the association between SNOT scores and Hi colonisation remained strong (p = 0.003).

This is in keeping with results in children which found that asymptomatic viral infections had a large effect on SPN colonisation[18]. They reported that the proportion of children with SPN colonisation was higher during prompted visits for review of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) symptoms rather than for regular planned study follow up visits. Due to the small sample size of SPN and virus co-colonisers (n = 6), it is difficult to make strong assumptions about the symptomology of co-infection from our study.
