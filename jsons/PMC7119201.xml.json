Although the specifics of the conformational changes differ between class I and class II viral fusion proteins, the major consequence of the low pH-induced conformational changes is the same: the formerly water-soluble protein ectodomains now bind tenaciously and hydrophobically to target membranes.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In all three cases, hydrophobic binding to target membranes has been shown to occur through the fusion peptide. Low pH-induced hydrophobic binding of the glycoproteins to target bilayers is an obligate prerequisite for membrane fusion. Hence, the key common step among viral fusion glycoproteins is conversion of their ectodomains from hydrophilic to hydrophobic entities by virtue of an exposed fusion peptide11 (Fig. 1\n, step 1).",

This concept first emerged from studies on a simple model alpharetrovirus, the avian sarcoma\u29f8leukosis virus (ASLV, formerly known as Rous sarcoma virus). The receptor for this virus is a small soluble type I integral membrane glycoprotein called Tva, an acronym denoting that it is the receptor for the avian tumor virus, subtype A.14 In 1997, it was shown that after binding to the glycoprotein at 4\u00b0, a small (83-amino acid) soluble form of the Tva ectodomain, sTva, could induce a soluble trimeric form of the ASLV subtype A (ASLV-A) envelope glycoprotein ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to bind hydrophobically to a target membrane at neutral pH. Binding to target membranes occurred at T > 22\u00b0 and was dependent on the wild-type fusion peptide sequence.15 Similar results were obtained subsequently by another laboratory.16 As yet, and most likely because of the relative simplicity of the avian retrovirus system (one viral glycoprotein and one simple host cell receptor; Table I), ASLV EnvA is the only viral glycoprotein that has been proven to bind to target membranes after a temperature-dependent interaction with its host cell receptor.15, 16, 16a\n",

When one viral glycoprotein and one \u201csimple\u201d host cell receptor are involved, it should be possible to develop assays directly analogous to those described above for studying Tva-induced binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes. A general prerequisite for a fusion protein\u29f8target membrane binding assay is a soluble and correctly oligomeric form of the viral fusion protein ectodomain. The simplest host cell receptors that would be amenable to this type of analysis are type I or type II integral membrane proteins (i.e., proteins whose ectodomains are tethered to the host cell membrane at only one end, either N or C terminal). Soluble versions of the ectodomains of these receptors, produced by genetic engineering or proteolytic release (Fig. 5\n, image 1), could then be used to trigger the cognate fusion protein. The methodology could, similarly, be applicable to multimembrane-spanning host cell receptors when the functional part of the receptor is tethered at only one end (Fig. 5, image 2) or where an ectodomain loop (Fig. 5, image 3) preserves enough structure to function as a soluble analog, perhaps by generating a cyclic peptide analog of the loop. The same \u201creceptor reagents\u201d (Fig. 5) could be employed for intact virus particle\u29f8target membrane binding assays (Fig. 4).",

For HIV, a soluble ectodomain fragment of CD4, as well as the target liposomes containing the chemokine receptor, could then be used to recapitulate the target membrane binding step of the fusion reaction (Fig. 1, step 2). In addition, HIV Env presents another challenge in the development of a membrane binding assay: an envelope glycoprotein possessing two subunits that are not covalently associated. Because the gp120 and gp41 subunits of HIV Env are not associated in such a way, it has been shown that the gp120 subunit is shed after binding to its receptor (CD4).23 Therefore, it is necessary to take this into consideration when making a soluble form of this glycoprotein.",

In this case it may be easiest, at least for initial purposes, to measure receptor-induced binding of intact viral (or subviral) particles to target membranes (Fig. 4A). This would, however, require a soluble form of the host cell receptor as described above. We note that, in addition to our studies demonstrating binding of ASLV-A particles to target liposomes, several low pH-triggered viruses have been demonstrated to bind to liposomes, either as whole virus particles or as subviral particles; these cases include Sindbis virus, TBE, and influenza (Table I).",

In many cases (Table I) this event appears to be induced by binding to the host cell receptor under fusion-permissive conditions (e.g., physiologic temperature). Derivatives of the assays that we have described in this chapter should prove useful in monitoring this critical unifying event of receptor-induced fusion: receptor-induced binding of the fusion protein to target membranes. It is possible to do this with either the free (oligomeric) fusion protein ectodomain or with intact viral particles or subviral particles containing the viral fusion protein. Once a target membrane binding assay is established, it should provide a powerful tool with which to dissect further requirements for a key step in the fusion cascade: hydrophobic binding of the fusion protein to the host cell bilayer (Fig. 1, step 2).",

After engaging its receptor, Tva, at T \u2265 22\u00b0 (step 1), EnvA undergoes a conformational change in which the fusion peptides are exposed and can penetrate the target membrane. After penetration of the target membrane by the fusion peptides (step 2), trimers may cluster (step 3). Further conformational changes occur in which EnvA begins (step 4) to form, and then forms (step 5) a six-helix bundle, which mediates lipid mixing of the outer leaflets of the target and viral membranes. Action of the fusion peptides and transmembrane domains on the hemifusion diaphragm would then open the fusion pore (step 6). This model is based on similar models for the influenza HA.
