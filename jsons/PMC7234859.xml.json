At the start of the spread of COVID-19, Korea failed to contain the outbreak. Just two months ago, Korea was the worst infected country due to the mass outbreak in Daegu-Gyeongbuk.1 Over 170 countries imposed travel restrictions for travelers from Korea. The people's voluntary acts of social distancing, thermal monitoring, widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers, use of information and communications technology (ICT), aggressive testing, tracking suspected patients and tracing contact until the end, have dramatically overcome the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea.2 However, most experts predict that a second epidemic will come this fall and winter, 2020. It is necessary to prepare the nation by deciding that the second epidemic of COVID-19 will surely come. I would like to suggest that we should prepare for the second epidemic and sustainable social distancing measures in Korea.",

A pandemic is a war-like crisis. The regular army plays a role early on in the war. Thereafter, reserve forces are formed and put into service. In the event of a situation beyond the capabilities of medical personnel in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, a \u201cplan B\u201d is needed in advance for how to organize and apply the reserve medical personnel. Needless to say, advanced training is crucial for a pandemic crisis. Medical personnel designated as a reserve force should be fully prepared and aware of what to do if an infectious disease develops. Planning how to mobilize reserves is also necessary. There is no successful practice without training.",

Telemedicine by video and telephone was temporarily permitted during the crisis. To continue the use of ICT successfully in the future, the telemedicine should be applied with caution because the patient's condition quickly changes and varies in real time and medicine using ICT requires more difficult judgment compared with face-to-face clinic. Nevertheless the outbreak of COVID-19 creates an opportunity to develop various ICTs in medicine.",

The director of the KCDC should plan, educate, and train national systems for crisis.

From April 6th, 2020, due to the strengthened SD effect over the next two weeks, the incidence of patients decreased to less than 100 patients per day. After conducting SD, the proportion of patients with unknown infection route remained below 5% and the proportion of patients under quarantine, i.e., self-isolation measures, exceeded 80%. Since the effect of enhanced SD was confirmed, the government extended SD for the third time for two more weeks.
