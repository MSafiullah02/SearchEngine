In 2015, a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection occurred after exposure to a single patient in an overcrowded ED of a hospital in South Korea; several individuals, including healthcare workers (HCWs), were infected [3,4]. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HCWs must use a particulate filtering facepiece respirator that is at least as protective as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 respirator) or its equivalent when treating patients with airborne infectious diseases [5,6]. However, such facepiece respirators can provide protection only when the face seal fits tightly. Therefore, fit testing is essential; a qualitative or quantitative approach must be used to identify respirators that best suit each individual [7,8].",

Some exercises for the conventional QNFT mimic chest compression, which include bending at the waist and head up-and-down movement [9]. However, chest compression during CPR is significantly more dynamic and rapid than QNFT exercises. Therefore, it is unclear whether the protective effects of the N95 respirators will be maintained during chest compression particularly in those who failed at least one individual conventional QNFT exercise. Previously, Shin et al. have evaluated the effects of movements during chest compression on the protective performances of various N95 respirators in the simulated setting [13]. They demonstrated that the FFs of certain respirators decreased during chest compression, thereby seriously compromising respiratory performance.",

However, we worked in a simulation laboratory, and the outcomes of the present study might differ from those of real-world settings. The participants performed continuous chest compression based on the assumption that the patient had an advanced airway. However, in patients without an advanced airway, chest compressions are briefly paused to provide ventilation [16]. CPR is complex, featuring chest compression, endotracheal intubation, defibrillation, bag-valve ventilation, intravenous line insertion, and drug administration. However, we focused on chest compression only. If the participants carried out other tasks, then the outcomes might have differed. In addition, in the present study, the participants were instructed not to talk as much as possible. We believed that such action was reasonable when providing CPR to patients with air-borne disease. However, HCWs need to talk for communication in real settings, which can loosen the fitting of the N95 respirator. Second, we had only three respirator types available; thus, our results cannot be generalized to other models. Third, although chest compression lasted for 2 min, the FF was obtained after excluding data from the first 20 s because the time was used for ambient purge, ambient sample, and mask purge.",
