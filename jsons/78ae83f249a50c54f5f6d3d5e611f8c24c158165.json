The common symptoms included fever, chills, rigor, myalgia and diarrhoea. 3 However, atypical symptoms do exist. With these atypical symptoms, patients with SARS can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having a surgical disease. If in such cases, infection control measures are not tightly observed, the disease would pose a definite threat to all health care workers involved. We report a case where the patient was clinically diagnosed as having peritonitis at presentation and was operated on but was eventually found to have SARS as the primary pathology. We believe that this is the first ever reported surgical procedure on a SARS patient.",

The chest was clear on auscultation. Marked epigastric tenderness with localized guarding was noted on abdominal palpation. An initial chest X-ray showed a clear lung field bilaterally. Blood tests showed notable leucocytosis (white cell count = 22.9 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and mild hyponatraemia (Na = 128 mmol/L). Repeated physical examination revealed florid pertoneal signs. Her blood pressure started to drop despite adequate rehydration. A clinical diagnosis of generalized peritonitis was made and surgery was offered to the patient. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy was performed; however, the view was obscured by the dilated transverse colon.",

The cause of the positive abdominal symptoms and signs could possibly be explained by pleural irritation. The cause of this atypical presentation of SARS in our case might also be caused by the same mechanism. With this in mind, we have to be aware that these patients could sometimes present with abdominal symptoms and become the so-called 'invisible spreader' who will cause an outbreak in the ward or even in the whole hospital. From the data, we know that fever is the most common symptom among SARS patients 6 and we believe it would be fair to isolate all feverish patients when the source of infection is uncertain, especially in a SARS epidemic area.",

In times of epidemic, we bear a mindset that everyone could be a potential SARS patient and we observe all infection control measures strictly. These measures include patient screening, environmental control, proper use of personal protective equipment, continuous education of patients and health care workers and frequent auditing. 7 During surgery, we implement extra precautions by using a N95 respirator, water impermeable gowns, full face shields and extra eye protection with goggles. After implementing these measures, we have seen fewer health care workers becoming infected in Hong Kong, and we believe that these measures are effective in preventing inhospital outbreaks, thereby preventing further outbreaks in the community. Similar measures are observed in other SARS epidemic areas, such as Singapore and Canada. 8, 9 As a final and important point, it should be remembered that a SARS resurgence is highly possible 10 and we cannot emphasize enough the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion and alertness towards SARS infection. It is only by 100% compliance with the precautionary measures mentioned, that health care professionals can possibly protect patients and themselves from SARS.",
