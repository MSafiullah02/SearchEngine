Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNN s) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC ), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.",

Fast detection of the COVID-19 can be contributed to control the spread of the disease. One of the most successful algorithms that have been proved its ability to diagnosis medical images with high accuracy is convolution neural network (CNN ). For example, in [2] , a CNN was applied based on Inception network to detect COVID-19 disease within computed tomography (CT ). In [3] , a modified version of ResNet-50 pre-trained network has been provided to classify CT images into three classes: healthy, COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. Chest x-ray images (CXR) were used in [4] by a CNN constructed based on various ImageNet pre-trained models to extract the high level features. Those features were fed into a Support Vector Machine SVM as a machine learning classifier in order to detect the COVID-19 cases. Moreover, in [5] , a CNN architecture called COVID-Net based on transfer learning was applied to classify the CXR images into four classes: normal, bacterial infection, non-COVID and COVID-19 viral infection.",

For instance, in [8] , three statistical features were calculated from lung texture to discriminate between malignant and benign lung nodules using a support vector machine classifier. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix method was used with Backpropagation Network [9] to classify images from being normal or cancerous. With the availability of enough annotated images, deep learning approaches [10, 11] have demonstrated their superiority over the classical machine learning approaches. CNN architecture is one of the most popular deep learning approaches with superior achievements in the medical imaging domain [12] . The primary success of CNN is due to its ability to learn features automatically from domain-specific images, unlike the classical machine learning methods. The popular strategy for training CNN architecture is to transfer learned knowledge from a pre-trained network that fulfilled one task into a new task [13] . This method is faster and easy to apply without the need for a huge annotated dataset for training; therefore many researchers tend to apply this strategy especially with medical imaging.",

The class decomposition layer aims to partition each class within the image dataset into several sub-classes and then assign new labels to the new set, where each subset is treated as an independent class, then those subsets are assembled back to produce the final predictions. For the classification performance evaluation, we used images of chest x-ray collected from several hospitals and institutions.

We adopted the last fully connected layer into three classes and initialised the weight parameters for our specific classification task. For class decomposition process, we used k-means clustering [16] . In this step, as pointed out in [15] , we selected k = 2 and hence each class in L is further divided into two clusters (or subclasses), resulting in a new dataset (denoted as dataset B) with six classes (norm 1, norm 2, COVID19 1,COVID19 2, SARS 1, and SARS 2), see Table 1 .",

The dataset was divided into two groups; 70% for training the model and 30% for evaluation of the classification performance. We used ResNet18 as an ImageNet pre-trained network in the transfer learning component of DeTraC. ResNet18 [23] consist of 18 layers with input image size of 224 \u00d7 224 and achieved an effective performance with 95.12% of accuracy. The last fully-connected layer was changed into the new task to classify six classes. The learning rate for all the CNN layers was fixed to 0.0001 except for the last fully connected layer (was 0.01) to accelerate the learning. The min batch size was 64 with a minimum 100 epochs, 0.0001 was set for the weight decay to prevent the overfitting through training the model, and the momentum value was 0.95. The schedule of drop learning rate was set to 0.95 every 5 epochs. DeTraC-ResNet18 was trained based on deep learning mode. For performance evaluation, we adopted some metrics from the confusion matrix such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The results were reported and summarised in table 2.",

They can be used as an end-to-end network, where an enormous number of annotated images must be provided (which is impractical in medical imaging). Alternatively, transfer learning usually provides an effective solution with the limited availability of annotated images by transferring knowledge from pre-trained CNN s (that have been learned from a bench-marked large-scale image dataset) to the specific medical imaging task. Transfer learning can be further accomplished by three main scenarios: shallow-tuning, fine-tuning, or deep-tuning. However, data irregularities, especially in medical imaging applications, remain a challenging problem that usually results in miscalibration between the different classes in the dataset. CNN s can provide an effective and robust solution for the detection of the COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray CXR images and this can be contributed to control the spread of the disease. Here, we adopt and validate our previously developed deep convolutional neural network, we called DeTraC, to deal with such a challenging problem by exploiting the advantages of class decomposition within the CN N s for image classification. DeTraC achieved high accuracy of 95.12% with ResNet on CXR images.",
