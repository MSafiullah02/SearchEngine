In Escherichia coli two codon-specific release factors {RF1 and RF2) direct the termination of protein synthesis, while in eukaryotes a single factor is required. The E. coli factors have been purified and their genes isolated. A combination of protein and DNA sequence data reveal that the RFs are structurally similar and that RF2 is encoded in two reading frames. Frame-shifting from one reading frame to the next occurs at a rate of 50%, is regulated by the RF2-specific stop codon UGA, and involves the direct interaction of the RF2 mRNA with the 3' end of the 16S rRNA. The RF genes are located in two separate operons, with the RF1 gene located at 26.7 min and the RF2 gene at 62.3min on the chromosome map. Ribosomal binding studies place the RFbinding region at the interface between the ribosomal subunits. A possible mechanism of stop-codon recognition is reviewed.",

            "text": "The termination of protein synthesis occurs when an in-frame stop codon enters the ribosomal A site. Unlike sense codons that are decoded by specific tRNAs via RNA-RNA interactions, stop codons are decoded by proteins termed release factors (RFs). Release factors have been purified from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and recent progress in defining the structural features of these factors has led to several unexpected results. This review addresses the structural features of RFs, the regulation and genetic organization of the RF genes in bacteria, RF ribosomal binding, and codon recognition by RFs. Ganoza (1966) first proposed that protein factors are required for polypeptide chain termination, and this was subsequently confirmed by Capecchi (1967) . A simple in vitro assay for termination activity (Gaskey et ai, 1968) allowed for the identification of two codon-specific protein factors in Eseherichia coli. Termination was found to require stop codons, a peptide analogue (f-met), and release factor. In E. coli, two codon-specific release factors (RF1 and RF2) are required for termination; RF1 participates in UAA-and UAG-directed termination and RF2 in UAA-and UGA-directed termination (Scolnick, 1968) . These factors have a predicted monomer size of 47-50 kiloDaltons (kD), are highly acidic proteins, and lack any nucleic acid or carbohydrate moieties (Ratcliff, 1979) . A third factor has been identified in E coli that stimulates the termination reaction and binds guanine nucleotides but is not codon-specific (Milman, 1969) . In eukaryotes, a single larger (56 kD) factor that directs termination for all three stop codons has been purified from a variety of sources, including rabbit reticulocytes (Goldstein et ai. 1970) , guinea-pig liver (Innanen and Nichols, 1973) , insect cells (Han, 1973) , and the brine shrimp Artemia salina (Reddington and Tate, 1979) , and, likewise, a single 45 kD factor has been shown to direct translational termination in rat liver mitochondria in a codon-specific manner (Lee ef ai, 1987) .",

A more recent report (Gampel and T2ago(off, 1989) suggests that herC is the constitutively expressed lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Transcription initiates immediately upstream of the RF2 start codon and proceeds in a counter-clockwise direction (with respect to the chromosome map) through the prfB and herC genes, producing a 2800bp transcript that terminates at a rho-independent termination site within 50 bp of the predicted herC stop codon. Kawakami ef ai (1988b) have isolated mutations of the RF2 gene by selecting for suppression of a IacZ UGA allele or temperature-sensitive condttional lethality using mutagenized PI phage.

The operon appears to encode three transcripts: two species that differ in length by 92 bp at the 5' end, and a third transcript of unknown function synthesized from the opposite strand. The hemA gene terminates with the RF1-specific stop codon UAG, followed 41 bp downstream by the RF1 initiation codon.

This observation provides a possible mechanism for the autoregulation of RF2, since the more proximal reading frame is terminated by the RF2-specific stop codon UGA. RF1 is synthesized from a single reading frame based upon the DNA sequence, although attempts to sequence the purified protein to confirm this have so far been unsuccessful. Subsequently, it was shown that this in-frame stop codon within the RF2 coding region is regulatory in an in wfro translation system; the addition of purified RF2 to the system produces a marked drop in RF2 synthesis (Craigen and Caskey, 1986 ). This finding is reminiscent of the autogenous regulation that has been described for several ribosomal protein operons; for example, the L1-mediated regulation of the L11 operon (Thomas and Nomura, 1987) , and serves to highlight the diverse regulatory mechanisms that have evolved in bacteria. RF2 employs its codon specificity to provide exquisite specificity for its own regulation, much as particular ribosomal proteins use the specificity of tfieir primary function, e.g. binding ribosomal RNA, to regulate the operons within which they reside.",

In this manner, it was demonstrated that frameshifting into the correct reading frame occurs approximately 30-50% of the time (Craigen and Caskey, 1986; Curran and Yarus, 1988; Weiss ef ai, 1987) , indicating that RF2 has evolved a capacity to thwart the ribosomal termination and reading-frame maintenance functions. This observation has since been extended to several eukaryotic organisms; a variety of eukaryotic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1, bovine leukosis virus, mouse mammary tumour virus, and the coronaviruses, exhibit high-efficiency spontaneous frameshifts, as do certain yeast transposons (reviewed in Craigen and Caskey, 1987b) . Although these organisms employ high-efficiency frameshifts, presumably to regulate ceiiuiar levels of particular proteins, the mechanism of frameshifting may be considerably different from that of RF2 (e.g. Brierley etai, 1989) . Work by Curran and Yarus (1988) has confirmed that the translation of RF2 reflects a simple competition between termination and frameshifting, and, in addition, they identified a short sequence element immediately upstream of the in-frame UGA that is required for high-efficiency frameshifting. This sequence has been shown to interact with the Shine-Dalgarno region of the 16S rRNA (Weiss e( a/., 1988) , providing experimental evidence that the 16S rRNA is involved in maintaining the correct reading frame during translation.",

The 'shiftiness' ot the frameshift codon is probably due to a string of pyrimidines within which the tRNA can slip, while the upstream element possibly constrains the 16S rRNA in such a way that reading-frame maintenance is perturbed. The fact that the UGA stop codon (or a sense codon that uses a minor tRNA species (Curran and Yarus, 1989) ) is required for a high rate of frameshifting suggests that the presence ot a stop codon slows the decoding event, thus allowing for the frameshift while the presence ot a sense codon (and the more rapid rate o^ tRNA binding at the A site) hinders frameshifting by decoding in-frame. One possible scenario for the RF2 frameshift is that normally during translation the Shine-Dalgarno region continually scans the mRNA as it moves through the ribosome. When it encounters the upstream element, binding may be so tight as to block this scanning tunction. It indeed stop-codon recognition involves a second region of the 16S rRNA binding to A site stop-codons, as has been suggested by Murgola et ai. (1988) , perhaps the binding of the Shine-Dalgarno region hinders stop-codon binding to its recognition region, thereby inhibiting RF binding to the ribosome and allowing tor the frameshift.",

For the large subunit, antibodies to L11 and L16 block RF-mediated peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, but leave RF ribosomal binding intact (Tate ef ai, 1975) . Since LIB is believed to be an essential part of the peptidyl-transterase centre, this finding supports the view that the hydrolysis reaction is carried out by the peptidyl-transferase centre. Antibodies to the small subunit proteins S3, S4, S5, and S10, which are clustered on the lower head and upper part ot the small lobe of the subunit, inhibit RF function, suggesting that the RFs bind in the interface region between the subunits in the area of the large subunit stalk (Tate ef ai, 1988) . By similar antibody inhibition techniques it has been shown that proteins L7/L12, S2, S9, and S11 are also required tor RF ribosomal binding, while antibodies to a number of ribosomal proteins appear to block the termination reaction by interfering with subunit association (Tate etai, 1975) . RF2 has been cross-linked to the large subunit proteins L2, L7/L12, and L11, and to a lesser extent to the small subunit proteins S6, SI 7, and S18 (Tate etai, 1975) . Tate etai. (1973; 1983a) reported that ribosomes containing either EF-G or EF-Tu tail to bind either RF, while ribosome-bound aminoacyl-tRNA alone has little inhibitory effect, suggesting some overlap in the binding domains of the translation factors with a separate site lor tRNA binding. The presence of L11 has been shown to have a differential effect on RF1 and RF2 activities, stimulating RF1-specific tunction while inhibiting that of RF2 (Tate et ai. 1983b) , suggesting that differences in the binding sites for RF1 and RF2 exist. Furthermore, displacement of the termination codon from the ribosomal A site by spacer nucleotides still allows for codon recognition and termination to take place (Tate ef ai, 1983a) , which suggests a degree of flexibility in RF binding to the ribosome. A recent report by Lang et al. (1989) demonstrates that, in the presence of RF2, the stop-codofi triplet UGA can be cross-linked to a number of proteins, including S6, S18, L2, L7/12, L10, and L20, further suggesting that codon recognition occurs in the interface region at the base of the large subunit stalk.",

The proposition that RFs directly bind stop codons is supported by two lines of experimental evidence: first, RFs compete with suppressor tRNAs for translation of termination codons in an in vitro translation system (Beaudet and Caskey, 1970) ; and second, equilibrium dialysis studies (Capecchi and Klein, 1969) have suggested that RFs can bind stop codons in the absence of ribosomes, although the codon specificity in these studies was not absolute and the experimental evidence weak. A more recent study of stop-codon binding by RFs failed to demonstrate stop-codon binding in the absence of ribosomes, but a 10-fold difference in binding between the cognate stopcodon UGA and the non-cognate codon UAG in the presence of ribosomes was seen; these results are consistent with the idea that codon recognition requires the RNA component of the ribosome (Lang ef a/., 1989 ).",

This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration that cleavage of the 3' -end of the 16S rRNA by cloacin DP 13 inhibits the partial reaction of codon recognition in the in vitro termination assay (Caskey et ai, 1977) . In addition, the recent observation that the region upstream of the RF2 frameshift site is complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence provides a possible mechanism both for highfrequency frameshifting and for termination in general.",

            "text": "A second line of evidence that suggests a role for the 16S rRNA in stop-codon recognition is the recent demonstration that a UGA-specific nonsense suppressor is, in fact, a single-base deJetion of a cytosine Jn the 163 rRNA at position 1054 in a region containing sequences complementary to UGA stop codons (Murgola etai. 1988 ). Based upon this observation, a model for codon recognition has been proposed whereby codon recognition occurs by means of RF2 interactions with this region of the 16S rRNA and not the 3'-end. The fact that Mycop/asma species use UGA as a sense codon and, likewise, lack this complementary sequence in an otherwise highly conserved region of the 16S rRNA adds support to this putative mechanism of stop-codon recognition. Although no definitive proof of RNA-RNA recognition has yet been provided, the most recent work in this area favours a role for the 16S rRNA, at least for RF2-mediated UGA termination. A recent report by Yano and Yura (1989) describes the suppression of a UGA mutant allele of rpoH by ribosomes lacking the Si 5 protein. Although this suppressor failed to suppress other UGA mutations, this observation does suggest that SI 5 may be involved in UGA-directed termination.",

Our laboratory has recently isolated the gene encoding the rabbit RF, and DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA reveals that it contains considerable structural similarity to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in general, and to tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase in particular, yet lacks any discernable similarity to the prokaryotic RFs (Lee et ai, in press ). This suggests that termination in eukaryotes has evolved in a manner greatly different from that of proka-In summary, after a long period when little headway was made in understanding peptide chain termination, the last few years have seen considerable progress in this essential step in protein biosynthesis. Hopefully, future studies may uncover the molecular basis for stop-codon recognition, perhaps the last remaining 'coding problem'.",
