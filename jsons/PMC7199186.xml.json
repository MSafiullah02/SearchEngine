Reduction in anatomic dead space then leads to improved work of breathing and lower respiratory rates. Mauri et al. demonstrated this effect in their study of hypoxemic patients with arterial partial pressure of oxygen to FiO2 ratios <300, where high-flow nasal cannula set at 40 l/min significantly reduced work of breathing and respiratory metabolic demand compared with oxygen delivered by face mask at 12 l/min.[6] Therefore, patients with hypercarbia, in addition to hypoxaemia, gain benefit from HFNCO, not only through reduction in anatomic dead space but also through reduced CO2 production via lowered metabolic demand.",

This spares the body the energy cost of warming and humidifying inspired gas. Warm humid gas is also associated with better conductance and pulmonary compliance compared to dry and cooler gas. It also improves mucociliary function, thereby facilitating secretion clearance, decreasing risk of atelectasis and improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio and oxygenation.",

While alveolar recruitment results from the positive airway pressure, the magnitude of this effect is variable, and its clinical significance remains somewhat controversial. However, studies have estimated the positive pressure delivered through HFNCO to equal roughly 1 mm H2O for every 10 l of flow.[7,8] In order to maximise the above-mentioned benefits of HFNCO, it is imperative to maintain the flow at the highest tolerated by the patient, usually at least 30\u201340 l/minute.",

Using evidence from several recently published studies, the WHO concluded that HFNCO does not create widespread dispersion of exhaled air, and therefore, should be associated with low risk of transmission of respiratory viruses.[9] They do recommend wearing a standard medical face mask if a medical provider is within 2 m of the patient. However, a newer study showed that the distance of droplet dispersion from coughing increases by an average of 0.42 m with high-flow nasal cannula, and travelled further than the WHO-recommended 2-m safe exclusion zone.[10] Based on this evidence, at our institution we ensure that COVID-19 patients on HFNCO are at the least in single-occupancy rooms with either negative pressure or high-efficiency particulate air filtration systems, and that all our healthcare workers caring for those patients wear full airborne personal protective equipment (i.e. N95 masks or equivalent, gown, gloves, goggles, hair covers and face shields).",
