            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile childhood vasculitis, associated with the development of coronary artery abnormalities [1]. KD predominantly affects young children aged between 6 months and 4 years, and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in Japan, European countries and the USA. However, KD is also reported in adults [2]. KD involves predominantly small and medium-sized arteries. Patients with complete KD usually have fever of at least 5 days duration and presence of four principal features: changes in peripheral extremities, polymorphous exanthema, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, and changes in the oral cavity and cervical lymphadenopathy (\u22651.5 cm diameter). KD is believed to be secondary to an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. The three distinct diagnostic vasculopathic processes observed in severely affected KD patients are necrotizing arteritis, subacute/chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation; and have the potential to cause life-long cardiovascular sequelae or death [3]. In this review, we focus on the predisposing factors, pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of KD.",

First, the clinical picture of KD overlaps with infectious diseases, such as adenovirus and scarlet fever. Second, seasonal clustering of KD during winter and spring is similar to other viral diseases like influenza viruses and enteroviruses [8]. In fact, temporal clusters of epidemics have been reported in Japan, the USA, Canada and Finland [9]. Presence of IgA plasma cells in the trachea of patients who died of acute KD suggests entry of the KD etiologic agent through the upper respiratory tract, resulting in an IgA immune response with systemic spread to vascular tissue [10]. Light and electron microscopy studies have demonstrated the presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the inflamed tissues of acute KD [11]. These inclusion bodies are suggestive of an infectious etiology of KD as a result of intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses.",

            "text": "Based on the clues obtained from clinical and epidemiological studies, the investigations into infectious causes of KD were focused mainly on superantigens, bacterial toxins and viral etiologies. Superantigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins do not need classical antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Superantigens cause extensive T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion following direct binding to major histocompatibility complex class II proteins on the surface of APCs. However, no specific bacteria or superantigens were identified in the KD scenario, but the clinical features of KD are similar to those seen in patients with staphylococcal and streptococcal toxin-mediated disease. The release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is directly related to the clinical picture of fever, mucosal involvement and desquamation in toxic shock syndrome and KD [12]. The infrequent occurrence of KD among young infants might be caused by passively acquired maternal antibodies to toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1 superantigen [13]. As compared to a control group, patients with KD are more likely to have positive rates of viral PCR for different viruses including enterovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus (50.4% vs 16.4%, P\n < 0.001) [14].",

Further, environmental factors such as improved public hygiene or western lifestyle in industrialized Asian countries might substitute normal flora with their variants [15]. Also, KD patients in Asian countries and Hawaii may have more probabilities of exposure and colonization of KD agents, and the distribution of some normal flora in parents or guardians of young children in these regions can differ to Western countries, including France, and developing countries. This might explain different racial incidences of KD.",

The number of patients and the incidence rate of KD in Japan are continuing to increase [18]. Further, the genetic basis of susceptibility to KD is complex, and no single HLA class II haplotype is common to most patients. Also, genetic factors might not be associated with racial difference of KD incidence. Table 1 shows candidate KD susceptibility genes that have recently gained interest 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and genetic study of adaptive immune cell compartments could further help to detect severely affected KD patients.

Data from several studies show that a SNP within the ITPKC gene confers susceptibility to KD as well as an increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms in Japanese, Taiwanese and American populations 20, 24. ITPKC also acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation through the Ca2+/NFAT signaling pathway. The ITPKC polymorphism might result in increased activation of T cells with an increased expression of IL-2. A SNP within the CASP3 gene has also been associated with susceptibility to KD in cohort studies of Asian and American patients 21, 25. It was found that G to A substitution in one commonly associated SNP located in the 5\u02b9 untranslated region of CASP3 abolished binding of NFAT to the DNA sequence surrounding the SNP [21].",

Furthermore, IgG and IgM antibodies derived from acute KD sera were reported to cause lysis of endothelial cells stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 [33]. These antibodies could also activate immune cells upon binding to activating Fc\u03b3R such as Fc\u03b3RIIA, expressed highly on various innate immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils. Therefore stimulation of Fc\u03b3RIIA results in the activation of these immune cells leading to expression of activation-associated surface molecules, co-stimulatory molecules and secretion of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Of note, a functional polymorphism in FCGR2A encoding an H131R substitution has been identified as a susceptibility locus for KD [26]. In addition, association between genomic hypomethylation of FCGR2A and susceptibility to KD has been reported recently [34]. These studies thus provide a pointer that either functional polymorphism or epigenetic changes lead to enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling and contribute to the pathogenesis of KD.",

These lesions could be efficiently prevented by IL-1 receptor antagonist treatment [28].

In addition, Th17 cell proportion and expression levels of cytokines associated with Th17 response (IL-17, IL-6 and IL-23) were also significantly upregulated in KD. By contrast, the proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the immunosuppressor cells that are crucial in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing inflammatory responses, were significantly downregulated in acute KD patients [38]. Not only the proportion of Tregs but also expression levels of Treg transcription factor FoxP3 were significantly downregulated in these patients [38]. Thus, the current hypothesis is that an infectious agent activates innate immune cells leading to Ca2+ mobilization and NLRP3 activation leading to IL-1\u03b2 secretion. IL-1\u03b2 enhances naive T cell survival and proliferation, and stimulates Th1 and Th17 cells (Fig. 1\n).",

ITPKC controls Ca2+ homeostasis by phosphorylating IP3 and genome-wide association studies have reported that polymorphisms within the ITPKC gene were associated with susceptibility and severity of Kawasaki disease. IP3 binds to its receptor IP3R expressed on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and causes the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Ca2+ mobilization mediates NLRP3 activation. Certain PAMPS are also capable of directly activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of the inflammasome results in the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its biologically active form IL-1\u03b2, which shapes adaptive immune responses. IL-1\u03b2 can enhance naive T cell survival and proliferation, via upregulation of the IL-2 receptor. Additionally, a role for IL-1R signaling in Th17 cell differentiation and homeostasis has been reported.
