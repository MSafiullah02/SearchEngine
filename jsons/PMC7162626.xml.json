This pre-screening can be done by phone before each appointment at the hospital and/or at the entry of the hospital. Body temperature should be measured at the entry of the hospital. Patients with symptoms suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be tested and managed in a COVID-19 hospital or in the COVID-19-dedicated departments/areas of the cancer center.3.Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment should be treated in COVID-19-free hospitals or COVID-19-free departments/areas of the hospital and be, as much as possible, shielded from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway.4.No visits should be allowed in the inpatient facilities and no accompanying care giver should enter the hospital with the patient for appointments or treatments.5.Staff should be organized by shifts, limiting the number of people working simultaneously to the minimum required.6.The multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDM) should be continued but performed via web meetings or restricted to one element of each discipline of the core team10. All decisions of the MDM should continue to be discussed with the patient and the final decision must account for the patients\u2019 preferences.7.Due to different availability of tests and different public health measures taken in each country, we recommend that testing guidelines of the national health authorities are followed. If tests are available, patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 before surgery or any invasive procedure and before initiating immunosuppressive therapies, independently of symptoms. If positive, the procedure and/or treatment should be postponed and resumed only after the patient is considered recovered. However, it is important to realize that even with this approach, some cases will be missed in view of the false negative rate of the PCR test on pharyngeal swabs.\n",

The situation might widely vary according to different countries but also in different cities and different hospitals. Therefore, it is even more critical that indications for treatment are taken in a multidisciplinary setting, in light of what is deemed to be the best option for each patient in that specific time and place. A crucial balance is needed between maintaining a high quality of breast cancer care, not jeopardizing cancer outcomes, and minimizing both the risks of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the risks of complications of anticancer treatments. The decision between primary surgery or PST should also take into account the pandemic scenario (Table 1) in each centre (i.e. early stages vs mitigation phase vs recovery phase). For instance, some patients with EBC who under normal circumstances would receive PST might be treated with primary surgery especially when a limited procedure is feasible in an outpatient setting. In contrast, some patients who, under normal circumstances, could be treated with primary surgery, such as postmenopausal women with limited luminal A/B disease, might be treated with primary endocrine therapy in order to delay invasive procedures and hospitalization.",

For this reason, treatment of EBC patients should, as much as possible, follow high quality international clinical guidelines31. However, some of the adjuvant systemic therapies have a significant risk of immunosuppression that can have detrimental effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some measures can be taken to decrease this potential detrimental effect:\n\u2022When utilizing chemotherapy regimens with intermediate/high risk of immunosuppression, such as anthracyclines, 3-weekly docetaxel or 3 weekly platinum, hematopoietic growth factors can be used to decrease the risk of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.\u2022Steroids use should be limited to the indispensable, to avoid increasing the risk of immunosuppression.\n\u2022To decrease the number of visits to the hospital, 2-weekly (dose-dense) or 3-weekly regimens should be preferred. However, in patients above the age of 65 years, the number of visits should be balanced with the substantially better tolerability of weekly paclitaxel when compared to 3-weekly docetaxel. Dose-dense regimens allow for the shortest duration of treatment.\u2022For triple negative EBC, when deciding on the addition of platinum to anthracyclines and taxanes, the higher haematological toxicity and consequent risk of immunosuppression of these agents must be taken into account during this pandemic, in particular, considering that the potential additional benefit of these agents is still controversial.\u2022For HER2+ EBC, the use of anti-HER2 agents is highly recommended, as per guidelines, in view of the substantial survival benefit and the absence of data suggesting any detrimental effect of their use during this pandemic. In lower risk patients shortening trastuzumab administration to half year may be considered32, except for those treated with the APT (weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab) regimen. Trastuzumab subcutaneous formulation is preferred and, when resources allow it, home administration can be used.\u2022For ER+/HER2 negative EBC, the most difficult decision is related to the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. In cases where the benefit of this treatment is uncertain, the risk/benefit balance, during this pandemic, might more often be in favour of not administering chemotherapy. As for all decision-making process in oncology, the ultimate decision must be taken by the patient, after adequate information, since the attitude towards risks and benefits is highly variable according to individuals\u2019 values and preferences and may be different in the current pandemic situation. Genomic tests may be used to help treatment decision-making in doubtful cases.\u2022Adjuvant endocrine therapy, including the use of ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal women, should follow the usual international guidelines, since no additional risk is foreseen from these agents. In selected cases, 3-monthly administration of LHRH agonist can be used, provided that confirmation of ovarian suppression is done; however, in very young women and/or women taking an aromatase inhibitor, the risk of inadequate ovarian suppression with the 3-monthly administration is higher. In addition, the administration of an LHRH agonist can be performed at home, if resources allow it.\u2022For adjuvant bisphosphonates, oral formulations can be preferred during this pandemic. Possible delay of administration or moving the administration earlier, when resources are still available may also be considered, in particular considering that the interval of administration of i.v. formulations is every 6 months.\n",

In addition, metastatic disease carries in itself some level of immunosuppression. It is therefore essential that all ABC patients remain under adequate treatment, according to high quality international guidelines 33, and close surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding these facts, some measures may be taken to decrease the risk of complications and allow for adequate treatment of these patients.\u2022Even under normal (non-pandemic) circumstances, the balance between quantity and quality of life is crucial in the management of ABC. This holds equally in the COVID-19 pandemic and more so where treatment options are being cautiously considered, underscoring the need for shared decisions with patients. Dose reductions and dose interruptions should be considered, whenever the side effects are important. In some cases of prolonged treatments and stable disease, treatment holidays may be considered but require active and tight surveillance.\u2022For ER+/HER2 negative ABC, endocrine-based therapy is the preferred choice for the vast majority of patients and should follow the usual international guidelines, including the mandatory use of ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal women.\u2022One of the most difficult decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to the addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitors, in view of their immunosuppressive effect. These agents are now considered the standard of care for this subtype of breast cancer but can be used in either 1st or 2nd line. During this pandemic, the decision to add a CDK 4/6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy should take into account the burden of metastatic disease, the pace of disease progression and the possibility of using these agents later in the course of the disease (situation variable in different countries).\u2022The addition of an mTOR inhibitor or a Pi3KCA inhibitor to endocrine therapy must also take into account their immunosuppressive effect and the risk of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease and other serious side effects, as well as the lack of survival benefit seen so far from the use of these agents. Decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the burden of metastatic disease, the pace of disease progression, the possibility of using these agents later in the course of the disease, and the availability of other therapeutic options.\u2022When utilizing chemotherapy, preference should be given to oral agents and agents with lower risk of immunosuppression, such as capecitabine, including for triple negative or HER2+ ABC. Vinorelbine can be used in its oral formulation and a dose reduction can be considered to avoid haematological toxicity.\u2022In cases where the use of i.v. agents and/or agents with higher risk of immunosuppression is needed, preference should be given to liposomal formulations of anthracyclines and 3-weekly regimens of taxanes or platinum compounds. Once again, the number of visits should be balanced with the substantially better tolerability of weekly paclitaxel when compared to 3-weekly docetaxel, in particular for older and/or less fit patients. Use of prophylactic hematopoietic growth factors should also be considered.\u2022For HER2+ ABC, the use of anti-HER2 agents is highly recommended, as per guidelines, in view of the substantial survival benefit and the absence of data suggesting any detrimental effect of their use during this pandemic.\u2022The use of bone modulating agents should be discussed on a case-by-cases basis, depending on the burden of bone disease and the presence/absence of symptoms. In many circumstances, it is possible to increase the interval of administration of i.v. bisphosphonates, limiting the number of visits to the hospital while maintaining a good control of bone metastases. Furthermore, the administration of s.c. denosumab can be performed at home, if resources allow it.\n",

The significant psychological impact on oncological patients is compounded by multiple factors during the pandemic \u2013 knowledge that the individual is at higher risk of serious complication if infected by Covid-19, loneliness and isolation as a result of social distancing, and the underlying constant fear of the cancer. Loneliness is associated with higher risk of mortality in cancer patients34\n,\n35. Social distancing is known to have negative health consequences and increase risk for premature mortality during normal times36, but it also enhances patients\u2019 feelings of uncertainty associated with their prognosis. It is now well documented that perceived uncertainty increases individual emotional distress and this in turn has negative effects on clinical outcomes in cancer patients37\n,\n38. Three main aspects explain such uncertainty: patients\u2019 perception of the impact of social isolation and of the healthcare crisis to access the cancer center to continue treatments; the risk of being infected when accessing the cancer center; and the need to change daily habits, especially those recommended by health professionals as affecting well-being and clinical outcomes, such as physical activity. The need to be isolated to contain the epidemics is a stark contrast to what is normally recommended for cancer patients including the importance of outdoor physical exercise and of maximizing social supports.",
