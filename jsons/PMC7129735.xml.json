They found 18 COVID-19 patients with cancer histories among 1590 COVID-19 patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial regions. Of these 16 patients (two of the 18 patients had unknown treatment status), only four had undergone surgery or chemotherapy within the previous month; 12 had recovered from initial cancer treatments (eg, surgery or chemotherapy) and had no obvious immunosuppression. We therefore do not think the COVID-19 infections in the 12 survivors of previous cancers were associated with their cancers. COVID-19 is a highly contagious infection to which everyone, to our knowledge, is susceptible; the most important morbidity factor is exposure to an infection source.2\n",

Since January, 2020, more than 30 000 medical workers have gone to Wuhan to help manage patients, prevent the spread of COVID-19, and contain the outbreak, which has affected medical services outside Wuhan because there are now fewer doctors in those regions. Patients are also advised not to visit hospitals because of infection risk. Consequently, some clinical trials are being delayed; enforced quarantine, as is widely the case in Wuhan, complicates hospital attendance for repeat appointments and continuity in care, and when severe complications or emergencies occur in patients with advanced cancers, treatment delays or unavailability are possible concerns. Adverse effects among patients who receive immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as for severe myocarditis and pneumonitis)4 are more challenging to diagnose and might not be treated promptly, which might affect their survival.",
