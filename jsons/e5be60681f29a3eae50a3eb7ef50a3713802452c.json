Up-to-date epidemiological data show the extent of global infection 1 . The symptoms that are associated with COVID-19 are non-specific and include fever (44-98% of patients), dry cough (68-76% of patients), muscle pain (18% of patients) and fatigue (18% of patients) 2 . Initial data on infectivity suggest a maximum likelihood of reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 of 2.8 (that is, a person with the disease is likely to transmit it on average to a maximum of 2.8 other people if no one in their community is immune). This estimate will likely change as more data are analysed. Reported mortality data vary widely from 2.3% in China to 7.2% in Italy, where the highest number of patients has been diagnosed to date 3 .",

The need for frequent travel to dialysis units and unavoidable patient clustering during dialysis shifts further increase the risk of viral transmission.
