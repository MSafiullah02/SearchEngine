What they have they are; at any time, in any place, ready to stay or move on. Though human beings are commonly qualified as the zenith of evolution, we can learn from animals. No lion is inclined to kill and collect more food than he needs for himself and his pride; no eagle builds more than one nest to breed her offspring. Putting things into perspective, it appears that the retirement vision of many hardworking people strangely resembles an animalistic routine: spending time outdoors or with friends, enjoying sunshine and nature. As reflected upon by the Dalai Lama, \u2018Man sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices his money to recuperate his health\u2019. Thinking back about the past 20 years of my life, the second part of the Dalai Lama\u2019s contemplation is even more accurate: \u2018He is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then he dies having never really lived\u2019. So driven was I by the craving for something or another, that I omitted to savour the beauty of now.",

The past twelve months taught me that life is a house of cards; neatly stacked at this moment, and ready to collapse in the next when a single card is pulled out. A collapsing house of cards may turn out to be the greatest of gifts; a grace that one would have never dared to ask for. Had I been confronted with the perspective of my present situation a year ago I would have been frozen with worry; clinging for dear life to the status quo, afraid to lose what I had and treasured. As this book goes into print COVID-19 engulfs the World. Declared a Pandemic on March 11th, 2020, the unfolding crisis is a reminder that everything can change always, from one moment to the next. It also illustrates the dramatic consequences that ensue when societies do not invest systematically to cover the basic social needs of everyone. 2020 shows what happens when the interests of a few dominate over the needs of many; while the majority shy away from thinking, and doing something, about the consequences. The outcome of COVID-19 depends on the ability and willingness of individuals and institutions to widen their perspective radically. Hopefully, the paradigm shift that is presented in this book contributes to this change in dynamics.\n",

What we do daily not only shapes our habits and skills, our relationships and assets, it gradually makes us who we are, at least at the surface. Consequently, our jobs become central in determining the perception that we have of our own worth. The What becomes the Who. In addition, and although there are very diverse working relations and constellations today, with freelancing ever-growing thanks to technology, traditionally, work placed the worker in a position within a structure. The average employee did spend more time at the workplace than at home; more time with co-workers than with family and friends. Unemployment is unsettling because, beyond the material implications, it is uprooting not merely cherished habits but the social bounds and beliefs underneath; not just eliminating a set of activities but the personal eco-environment that they have been operated in.",

We focus on the tasks on our immediate radar, losing sight of the bigger picture. On the other hand, though, having narrowed down our perspective so much we lose sight of the actual impact of these multiple micro-tasks and their interaction. Rather than sharpening our focus on a very circumscribed field in order to give our very best in this particular field, we rush from one task to the next, just as a hamster keeps running in its wheel, step after step after step. There is always one more task, deadline, or paper to tackle; absorbing our time and energy. Our mental space is saturated before we even start to think what matters for ourselves.",

If we followed his words, there would never be the need to worry what we should have done differently. Similarly, a central principle of Karma yoga is to give one\u2019s best, and then let go1; the results of whatever has been done are not in the hands of the one who acted (Raju 1954). However, that the output of our doing is no longer the centre does not remove the responsibility to give one\u2019s best. Giving what we have and can do, in every single moment, dedicating our whole being, all our attention to the very situation that we are in, the person we interact with, the task at hand, means that we do the best we can at that moment. If you act in line with your values, putting all the possible effort, and the best knowledge that you have at the time of the action, why would you blame yourself if the outcome of your action is not the expected one?",

The removal of one single card brought the house of my apparent identity down, pushing me out of my secure comfort zone, across a rainbow of freedom.

However, like many of us who work in the field of humanitarian action I was, for a long time, neither ready nor willing to think through the whole equation from A to Z, from doubt to evidence to action; as I was not prepared to face the necessary consequences. Too painful was the prospect of realizing that what I had aimed for was questionable. That my law studies, masters in humanitarian assistance and crisis law, Ph.D. on children\u2019s rights, and nearly two decades working in the field had been geared towards a mirage. I had not done any harm but being honest with myself it was doubtful that much tangible benefit derived from my presence for those so-called \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 whom I had set out to serve.3 The more I saw, the more I knew my doubts to be justified, yet I did not have the courage to act in line with the ensuing conclusion.

Rare are those which have put in place support systems for their staff. Psychological preparation before the deployment of frontline workers, assistance during and after assignments, remain punctual. The consequences are felt. Overwhelmed by the circumstances, individuals feel that their daily efforts, the way in which they do their professional tasks is insufficient, and as they move forward, they gradually perceive their work as being disconnected from the aspirations that brought them to this line of work in the first place. The realization of this disconnect then further deepens their emotional and physical corrosion. Research shows that humanitarian workers who have lost faith in their mission are the first to suffer from burnout and depression. Physical symptoms such as migraines and stomach cramps set in. Feelings of discouragement, emotional fatigue, and frustration appear. The ability to concentrate and reason diminishes, together with sociability. Many of those who have lost touch with their core values seek to compensate the resulting inner emptiness with coping tactics such as excessive sport, alcohol, drugs, etc. This affects not only their subjective well-being but also their objective actions. Performance declines, as do interpersonal skills. Feelings of anger or sadness find their expression in cynical, erratic, or aggressive behaviour, which further fuels the inner gloom. Personal life and work environment deteriorate. The opposite of the \u2018winner effect\u2019 which we will look further in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-45878-2_2 sets in. It is a downward spiral that begins inside and is cultivated from the outside. Conversely, those who cope the best with extreme stress are those who found meaning in their work and life.",

Though I have been lucky throughout my life, including the years spent on the frontlines, I know many who were not. In countries where violence is an omnipresent factor, the thinness of the line that separates life and death becomes apparent. In 2008, while working with UNICEF in Eastern Chad I was with colleagues on a field mission. Driving somewhere on the road between Abeche and the border to Darfur we noticed another UNICEF car on the side of the road, seemingly abandoned. As we learned later, a couple of hours before our passing an unidentified person had stopped the convoy; pulled out a staff member from Save the Children who was part of the same joint mission and shot him. Unharmed but traumatized the other passengers were taken to the next town by the second car of the convoy. Until today the exact circumstances remain unclear (Ngarmbassa 2008). Death is part of life, and living in countries afflicted by war made me aware of how much depends on timing\u2014being at the right time at the right place, or not. In 2009, after a slightly delayed landing at the airport of Afghanistan\u2019s capital Kabul, I was told to wait because the only road between the airport and the city was blocked.

During the almost two decades of my work in country offices around the world, I have repeatedly heard (and spoken) about the need for cross-sectorial collaboration. Convergence, thematic and/or geographic synergy of resources and efforts, makes perfect sense in theory and practice, but the internal hurdles to make it happen de facto are gigantic. Nobody denies that a combination of resources gets the best out of everyone\u2019s contribution, which is particularly relevant in times of limited funding, decreasing donor interest, and an increased requests for accountability. But when it comes to the elaboration of joint work plans and shared budget allocations, the spirit of collaboration often fades. Cooperation is already a thorny topic inside one organization, where experts seclude themselves in their respective sectorial pillars; it becomes nearly impossible to address when several UN agencies are asked to place their eggs in the same basket.",

Although few would dispute the complementary nature of these three components, translating the conceptual understanding from theory to practice is yet to be mainstreamed. Personal and institutional agendas and egos are not a good match. When the quest for visibility and funding are paramount, the programmatic substance is at risk of being relegated to the sidelines. Too often the ensuing collective dynamic nurtures the individual\u2019s human propensity of looking out for their own interests first (Janis 1982). The combination of engrained structures, processes, mindsets, and human habits, together with the ever-fiercer competition for donor funding are hard to overcome. Shifting from a narrow, patchwork approach of aid to a holistic understanding of support requires a 360-degree vision of short-term interventions, medium-term investments, and long-term cooperation with at its centre the aspiration of individuals as the core feature of collective resilience. This dimension that embraces aid workers and \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 alike is the key for reinjecting passion into the aid sector, and thereby harness the individual and collective power that it needs to transform society for good.

Even when a new domain arises with substantive proof of its need and added value, large organizations usually remain slow, if not immutable, to make the necessary shifts in a timely and substantive manner. Linking back to the question that we looked at earlier, mental health can serve as an example. It has been shown over and over for the past decades, that mental well-being impacts the physical frame, and that community resilience requires genuine personal empowerment. And yet, far and few are the aid organizations which have systematically included this thematic in their scope of programmatic action. Even institutions whose mandate invites this type of project remain reluctant to make substantive investments in research, programming, and advocacy in related fields. The mission of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) is to help every child survive and thrive, whereas the United Nations Fund for Populations (UNFPA) seeks a world where every birth is wanted, and every woman and young person finds their rights valued. Within these institutions a holistic approach to human  well-being would not only fit as an organic umbrella for bringing together traditional programmes like health, youth empowerment, child protection, education, and social protection; easing programmatic synergy along. It could even serve as a binding element for inter-agency planning and implementation. But so far it does not. Too engrained is the current modus operandi, too established are the existing programme and staffing structures. Change is always challenging, both for individuals and for organizations. It becomes even more trying when it not only involves the creation of something novel but the elimination or transformation of existing positions, possessions, and the privileges that are attached to them.",

It also offered me glimpses of something else in these places that often live under the shadow of a murky image.

It matters not, whether it is Goma, the so-called capital of rape in Eastern Congo, the cradle of terrorism in Kabul or the centre of cholera in Port-au-Prince, I found smiling mouths, warm eyes, helping hands, and stories that reflected an untamed spirit of survival everywhere. In Afghanistan I enjoyed time and tea in a traditional teahouse in Jalalabad, listening to the anecdotes of a seasoned Afghan colleague; hidden in a blue burqa I explored the local market in Herat, chatting with old women selling vegetables while tasting a delightful diversity of nuts and dried fruits. In Congo I shared the university benches with Congolese students, all of us trying to wrap our brains around Spanish for beginners.

Chained to my comfort zone I did what I had signed up for. Working for an international organization such as the UN is a pleasure and a privilege. And although I questioned myself constantly, helping children to survive and thrive, by promoting health, nutrition, clean water and hygiene, education, and protection services for those who need it the most is the most beautiful mission there is. A perfect mission, maybe. However, something was missing; and deep down I knew it. I invested my time and energy in the collective effort to improve the lives of children in this world. Yet while nothing was wrong; it was not right either. I saw, felt, and came to understand that the institution, the humanitarian community that I was part of, kept moving along a path of wilful blindness, headed towards chronic underperformance.",

Every life counts and every smile, every glimmer of rebuilt hope matters. But so much more could be done. Nourishing a system that is subliminally aware of its weaknesses yet avoids facing the double discomfort of honest introspection and substantial internal transformation equals cultivating a challenge rather than addressing it. I was insignificant but part of the status quo. Since I did not bring solutions to address the problem, I was part of the latter; one of many thousands of staff members who un-consciously nurture insufficiency under the umbrella of a beautiful mission, allowing the status quo to persist.",

            "text": "\nKarma means action, work, or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). Western culture, influenced by Christianity, holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase \u2018what goes around comes around\u2019. Karma Yoga (yoga of action) states that investing one\u2019s best efforts for the good of others is the principal path of developing spirituality (Rastogi and Pati 2015).How do you introduce yourself if you have no job?\nThe term \u2018beneficiary\u2019 will be used in this book as referring to individuals targeted by aid programmes. Even though it is a terminology that has made me cringe since I started working, because of the connotation of passivity, I have so far not found a widely recognized replacement term.Large-scale information campaigns, such as national drives to stop smoking, which include graphic illustrations on every cigarette package, may ensure that those who smoke are (intellectually) aware of the physical consequences. However, until the targeted consumers feel why it is time for them to stop, and feel ready and able to do so, the impact of these campaigns usually remains punctual and short-lived (Bicchieri 2016).\nFindings from disaster mental health have established that emotional distress is ubiquitous in affected populations\u2014a finding echoed in populations affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic; which means in 2020 nearly everyone. Public health emergencies may affect the health, safety, and well-being of individuals (causing, insecurity, confusion, emotional isolation, and stigma) and communities (owing to economic loss, work and school closures, inadequate resources for medical response, and insufficient access to basic necessities). These effects may translate into a range of emotional reactions (from distress over depression to psychiatric conditions), unhealthy behaviors (i.e. excessive substance use), and noncompliance with public health directives (i.e. disregard of home confinement). As for health care providers themselves, the novel nature of SARS-CoV-2, inadequate testing, limited treatment options, insufficient equipment with protective gear for frontline workers and other medical supplies, massively extended workloads, and other emerging concerns are sources of stress and have the potential to overwhelm individuals and systems alike (Pfefferbaum and North 2020).Indirectly this challenge is addressed when humanitarian workers who are deployed to provide traditional social service projects perform in line with their best intentions and abilities. For more details on potential venues to shift the angle of \u2018help\u2019 for individuals affected by crises, in particular young people, please refer to the \u2018Purpose for Power\u2019 chapter in \u2018Development, Humanitarian Aid and Social Welfare\u2019 (Walther 2020).In 2012, World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 was adopted, requesting WHO to provide leadership at the global level in collecting and reporting information on attacks on health care. The resulting \u2018Attacks on Health Care initiative\u2019 collects evidence through two main work streams: primary data collection in near real time through WHO country offices and partners on the ground using the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA), and secondary data monitoring at the global level, which is published quarterly. The secondary data complements the primary data collection in countries where primary data collection is not yet fully implemented.Groupthink refers to decision-making groups\u2019 extreme concurrence seeking (conformity) that is hypothesized to result in highly defective judgements and outcomes. According to Irving Janis, the inventor of the groupthink concept, decision-making groups are most likely to experience groupthink when they operate under the following conditions: maintain high cohesion, insulate themselves from experts, perform limited search and appraisal of information, operate under directive leadership, and experience conditions of high stress with low self-esteem and little hope of finding a better solution to a pressing problem than that favoured by the leader or influential members (Pratkanis and Turner 2007).A study by Sabine Lee, University of Birmingham and Susan Bartels, Queen\u2019s University, is the latest to document sexual misconduct by international peacekeeping forces (Lee and Bartels 2019). For example In Haiti girls as young as 11 were sexually abused and impregnated by peacekeepers, who were stationed in the country from 2004 to 2017 as part of The United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (UNSTAMIH) (French: Mission des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en Haiti); the babies that often resulted from these encounters are known today as \u2018little minusthas\u2019 and both mothers and children face stigma and shame, on top of the pre-existing abject poverty that led some of these women to sell their bodies in exchange for food or money.You may think this is high as it is above the commonly referred \u2018a dollar a day\u2019 (which was updated by the World Bank to PPP US$ 1.90 in 2015). However, this measurement is not about actual dollars but Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollars so they cannot be directly compared to the numbers here. Moreover, as the \u2018dollar a day\u2019 measure was constructed for international comparisons, it is not a good measure of poverty at the national level. Broader and further criticisms of the \u2018dollar a day\u2019 measure can be found in Deaton (2010), Reddy and Minoiu (2007), and Vandemoortele (2002).\n\n",

The social conundrum created by COVID-19 illustrates the interplay between short-term relief (humanitarian action), medium term assistance (development) and long-term building back. The 2020 crises shows that social transformation is not only missing, as a fourth pillar, of the Nexus equation, it is the umbrella that entails the others. Social peace is the counterpart of sustainable transformation; both require the empowerment of and support to individuals. While (long-If lasting) peace is the core aspiration (at the core), the humanitarian action-development assistance bridge needs to be crossed in order to arrive at sustainable social change and transformation. These elements influence each other mutually. Sustainable impact in either of these fields begins with a holistic perspective of individual well-being; and it is nurtured by the mutual complementarity of investments and progress in all dimensions (Source Author)",
