For the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, differences between groups were assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and Student\u2019s t test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables when appropriate. Multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of explanatory variables on outcome (ICU mortality). To avoid spurious associations, only variables with a relationship in univariate analysis (p \u2264 0.1) or a potential plausible relationship with outcome were entered in the logistic regression models. In addition, the effectiveness of the macrolides on ICU mortality was further estimated using propensity scores. Propensity score analysis aims to balance observed covariates between treated and untreated patients from the study to mimic what happens in a randomized study [23], thus creating a quasi-randomized experiment from a non-randomized observational study. In our study, propensity scores were estimated by fitting a logistic regression. The covariates included in the propensity score model were those with a potential impact on outcome measured previous to macrolide treatment: age, APACHE II score, gender, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cardiac heart failure, chronic renal failure, hematological disease, pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, and empiric oseltamivir treatment. Propensity score quintiles were derived, and boxplots of the estimated propensity scores for treated and untreated patients within each quintile of the propensity scores were plotted to assess the validity of the analysis. Finally, we fitted a logistic model for outcome including as covariates the propensity score quintiles and treatment. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted including the post-treatment variables in the propensity score analysis. These variables were invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction/failure, corticosteroid use, and CRRT. For all analyses, p values <0.05 were considered significant. We used SPSS for Windows 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, US) for all analyses.",

Briefly, chronic renal disease, hematological disease, and immunosuppression were comorbid conditions significantly associated with higher ICU mortality; in addition, MV, septic shock, MODS, corticosteroids, and CRRT were more frequent in patients who died. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for severity (APACHE) and potential confounding factors (COPD, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, morbid obesity, immunosuppression and hematological disease) found the use of macrolides was not significantly associated with lower ICU mortality rate (OR = 0.89; 95 % CI 0.53\u20131.49, p = 0.6).When the analysis was done on the subgroup of patients receiving MV, similar results were obtained (OR = 0.77; 95 % CI 0.44\u20131.35, p = 0.4). The propensity score analysis found no effect of macrolide treatment on outcome (OR = 0.87; 95 % CI 0.55\u20131.37, p = 0.5), and the sensitivity analysis revealed a very similar result (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.58\u20131.44, p = 0.7).

            "text": "Several studies have found better outcomes in patients with CAP administered combinations of antibiotics [24\u201326] and also, more specifically, in patients with CAP administered combinations of macrolides with other antibiotics [27\u201330]. Restrepo et al. [31] found that the use of macrolides in combination therapy improved outcomes in patients with CAP and severe sepsis. Tessmer et al. [32] analyzed a large cohort of patients with CAP and reported better 14-day outcome for patients with high CRB65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age over 65 years) risk classes receiving beta-lactam/macrolide compared to those receiving beta-lactam alone. More recently, our group analyzed a cohort of critically ill patients requiring MV for severe CAP in a multicenter study and found that treatment with macrolides in combination therapy according with 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines improves survival compared to fluoroquinolones [15]. Interestingly, this protective effect of macrolide therapy was more pronounced in the more severe patients. Thus, combination therapy and especially combination therapy including macrolides seem recommended in patients with CAP caused by bacteria. The rationale for combining antibiotics in patients with CAP is based on their different mechanisms of action, resulting in synergistic killing and a broader antimicrobial spectrum; however, macrolides are linked to an anti-inflammatory effects more than anti-infective properties [33\u201335]. Although there is a strong body of evidence for considering combinations including a macrolide in patients with bacterial CAP, evidence for this approach in patients with viral pneumonia without bacterial co-infection is lacking. The Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine currently recommends patients admitted to an ICU with pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection should be administered combination antibiotic therapy including a third generation cephalosporin and either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone. This recommendation is based on the current guidelines for CAP management from the Spanish Thoracic Society (SEPAR), Spanish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (SEIMC), and Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SEMICYUC) [18]. Antibiotic therapy in patients with primary viral pneumonia had to be maintained until cultures rule out bacterial infection; however, the final decision should be individualized to reduce resistance and complications related to antibiotic overuse.",

The most common pulmonary presentation of patients affected by pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection is a rapidly progressive viral pneumonia with bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest radiographs and ARDS. The presentation of ARDS with severe refractory hypoxemia has been particularly common in patients with this disease and might be linked to an abnormal immune response [36]. Investigating this hypothesis, To et al. [37] demonstrated that, due to excessive cytokine activation, patients with ARDS and those who died had slower control of viral load than patients with mild disease.",

Macrolides have remarkable anti-inflammatory properties that exceed their antibacterial activity [33]. Animal models of H2N2 influenza virus have shown that macrolides bring about beneficial effects by decreasing interferon gamma (IFNg) and reducing the level of nitrite/nitrate (metabolites of nitric oxide) [38]. In addition, a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis found that treatment with clarithromycin was associated with significant reductions in the length of hospital stay, the duration of need for supplemental oxygen, and the need for beta2-agonist treatment [39]. However, scant information about the impact of macrolides on the outcome of patients with H1N1 is available [40]. To our knowledge, the only study to consider the role of macrolides was reported by Viasus et al. [41]. These authors analyzed a cohort of 197 patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 complicated by pneumonia, only 31 of whom were treated with macrolides. They found immunomodulatory therapies (corticosteroids, macrolides, and statins) as a group were not associated with a lower risk for developing severe disease, defined as ICU admission or death; however, the overall mortality was low (n = 3.5 %).",

            "text": "The present study has several potential limitations. First, given the epidemiological nature of this study, no data about the number of patients in whom respiratory samples were obtained before antibiotic administration or the number of patients that received antibiotics before ICU admission, and this is important because the causative agent of CAP remains unidentified in 30\u201350 % of cases (18). In addition, because, we included all patients with negative bacterial respiratory or blood cultures, one-third of whom were not receiving mechanical ventilation, the analysis was also restricted to the subgroup of ventilated patients and similar results were obtained. Furthermore, this was an observational, non-interventional study rather than a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which interventions could be tightly managed and the control and treatment groups matched. However, the epidemiological characteristics and emergency nature of this disease preclude clinical trials, so we did a propensity score analysis, which replicates some of the characteristics of a randomized controlled trial, to verify and validate our results. Second, the ICUs from 148 hospitals that participated in this observational, non-interventional study were self-selected, and the decision to prescribe macrolides was made in accordance with local protocols. Although our study includes more than 70 % of all patients admitted to ICUs in Spain during the present pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection [13], the present analysis enrolled patients prospectively and represents a homogeneous population from critical care settings. Likewise, we had no data on viral load secreted by the respiratory tract in our cohort of patients; however, early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors has proven a protective factor in severe cases of 2009 pandemic influenza, and the results of our study reinforce the importance of therapeutic strategies based on the early administration of antiviral drugs to control viral replication.",
