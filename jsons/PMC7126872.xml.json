AP partnered with Automated Insights to begin automating quarterly earnings reports and now publishes 3000 such financial stories every quarter (Miller, 2015). After an earthquake hit Los Angeles one morning, it took only 3 min for the LA Times to write and publish an article about it online. It was written by an algorithm (Neal, 2014).",

Among the data-oriented practices emerging in journalism, Carlson (2015) noted that none appear to be as potentially disruptive as automated journalism, insofar as it calls up concerns about the future of journalistic labor, news compositional forms, and the very foundation of journalistic authority. Meanwhile, automated content with no human intervention beyond the initial programming can make journalists free from handling basic works and afford time to focus on more investigative reporting. It could be an opportunity for media companies to reinvent news production system by generating news faster, at a larger scale, and with fewer errors. It also could be beneficial for audience pursuing more news and unbiased reporting.",

Such concerns have recently regained prominence. In their widely discussed book The Second Machine Age, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) offered an unsettling picture of the likely effects of automation on employment. They asserted that there's never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value. However, there's never been a worse time to be a worker with only \u2018ordinary\u2019 skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots, and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014, p. 11).",

How does the public perceive and evaluate the quality of computer-written news articles? Can they tell the differences between articles written by a human journalist and algorithms? Journalists perceive themselves as a professional group differentiated with the public, because they have expertise and duty. Then, how do journalists' perception and evaluations of algorithm-written articles compare with those from the public? This study compares the perceived quality of algorithm-written articles with the work by human journalists. To answer the questions, we sampled both general readers and journalists and conducted a series of experiments with human- and algorithm-written articles.",

Most portrayals of working journalists highlighted many negative characteristics that branded the profession for decades (Evensen, 2000, Welford, 1998). Bridger (1997) analyzed 59 films containing portrayals of photojournalists and found the stereotypes framed in negative images. A number of movies such as \u201cNetwork\u201d and \u201cBroadcast News\u201d cynically depicted journalists as greedy, aggressive, and cold-hearted people who are manipulating the news-gathering process to achieve their professional success.

In all, more than 300 passengers and crewmembers died in the disaster. The country's mainstream media critically failed in their jobs right in the midst of the disaster. Public criticism has been mounting against the Korean media because they dismissed the truth, published provocative stories, and parroted the government's announcements without checking the facts and questioning them.

The Korea Press Foundation reports an audience's survey with more than 5000 nationals every other year (Korea Press Foundation, 2014). From 2006 to 2014, although the public's evaluation for social influence of journalists was above average, journalists' credibility decreased from 3.00 to 2.68 out of 5.00 points. The score for ethical transparency of journalists also decreased from 2.95 to 2.77. According to these results, journalists in Korea fall short of the required ethical standards that are set in the audience's minds. Historically, trust in journalists and news organizations has not been high in Korea. In particular, misinformation about the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 and about the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 affected trust in the news media. A survey on the news consumption conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 revealed that Koreans' trust for journalists and news organizations was only 17%, which was ranked the 25th out of 26 developed countries participated in the survey (Reuters Institute, 2016).",

In fact, algorithm-written news is not the first threat to journalists. In response to new developments, journalists have often proved to be a conservative community that protects its boundaries (e.g., Lahav and Reich, 2011, Van Dalen, 2012). By stressing the boundaries between the outsider and the journalistic profession, hegemony may be sustained. Previous studies have examined the manner by which professionalization works in the field of journalism. Since Thomas Gieryn (1983) suggested the concept of \u201cboundary work\u201d, many researchers have devoted to the demarcation problem and how does it work within a large occupational, political, and economic social structure.

In the mid-1970s, Computerized Typesetting System (CTS) and Computer Assisted Reporting (CAR) as new technology have deeply affected journalism as labor. CTS have substituted the metal type in newspaper printing and CAR have substituted handwriting in reporting. The computer reduced the labor intensity of journalists in editing and reporting (Howard, 2014). These technologies also reduced the number of employees in the newsroom. For example, the \u2018operator\u2019 as technician of the metal type has been disappeared by computer. But, disappeared occupational group in newsroom such as operator did not belong to journalistic profession. These groups were assistant of journalists. Of course, journalists had been compelled to adopt computer as a new reporting and editing device. However, journalists thought of computer as assistant of them.

Again they are forced to position themselves in relation to an external threat, which potentially challenges their jurisdiction over their main tasks. Van Dalen (2012) studied the response of the journalistic community to automatic content creation by analyzing 68 newspaper articles and blog posts covering Statsheet, an automated sports news creation site, during 2010. Contrary to previous studies that described the journalistic community as conservative and defensive, journalists who wrote about robot journalists did not reject the new development. Van Dalen (2012) interpreted this finding for three different reasons. First, the journalists who wrote about robot journalists can be seen as early adopters who are more open to change than the journalistic community at large. Second, because automated content creation is mostly applied to sports journalism rather than domains like politics or international affairs, journalists might be more generous. Finally, the journalists who wrote about automated-content analysis are observant of a trend that still remains largely abstract and does not influence their own work directly.",

Contemporary research on intergroup relations, prejudice, and discrimination appears to accept, at least implicitly, the idea that ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity are reciprocally related. The idea can be derived from a number of theoretical assumptions. In an environment of scarcity, individuals needed to band together in groups to compete with other groups for survival (Sumner, 1906). Another approach to ingroup-outgroup distinction can be explained by the zero-sum perspective in which attachment and positive affect toward an ingroup is achieved through distance and negative affect toward corresponding outgroups. In fact, it is a sense universally true that \u201cwe\u201d are more peaceful, trustworthy, friendly, and honest than \u201cthey.\u201d This is reinforced by a general preference for the familiar over the unfamiliar (Brewer, 1999).

Automated content creation can also help to cover stories for small audiences, which now go uncovered. Van Dalen (2012) adds that journalists see the advantages of an algorithm as an unbiased reporter. Tow Center for Digital Journalism suggests other potentials for algorithms in journalism (Graefe, 2016). Algorithms are able to generate news faster, at a larger scale, and potentially with fewer errors than human journalists. Algorithms can use the same data to tell stories in multiple languages and from different angles, thus personalizing them to an individual reader's preferences.

As a result, algorithms could produce outcomes that were unexpected, unintended, and contained errors (Graefe, 2016). It might lead to the ethical quandary. If factual errors are discovered, does the software take responsibility? There are other ethical questions such as transparency and copyright. Although most journalists expect the robots will work as complementary to rather than replacing their jobs, automated content creation can be serious competition and a threat to the job security of journalists performing basic routine tasks (Van Dalen, 2012). In fact, changes in news organizations have been due to coercion from above and to weak-tie connectivity with the organization's market and readers (Lowrey, 2011). To accommodate for an algorithm-written article and develop high-quality journalism with the help of algorithms, more communication and accurate division of work roles within media organizations and understanding readers' needs are necessary.",
