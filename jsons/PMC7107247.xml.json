            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a disease caused by the IB virus (IBV), a member of the Gammacoronavirus genus, the Coronaviridae family, and the Nidovirales order (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2009). IB has a significant economic impact with production losses related to poor weight gains, condemnation at processing and mortality in broilers, suboptimal egg production and egg downgrading in laying birds (Cook et al., 2012). Despite the applied intensive vaccination programs, outbreaks re-emerge as a consequence of infections with new variants that differ serologically from the strains used for vaccination (Chen et al., 2010; Leghari et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018). Besides, in the absence of a \u201cstandard\u201d vaccination program against IB, the program recommended by the National Committee for Avian Pathology (NCAP) remains an alternative to prevent avian disease infections. Unfortunately, it appears that there are programs as breeding as reported by Cherif et al. (2010). This largely explains the variability of protection outcomes and the sustainability of the disease, despite the availability of the latest generation of vaccines.",

            "text": "The IBV genome consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 27.6 kb, which encodes several nonstructural proteins involved in RNA transcription and replication and four structural proteins, known as small membrane (E), membrane (M), nucleoprotein (N), and spike glycoprotein (S) (Boursnell et al., 1987), which is formed by a globular (S1) subunit that is anchored in the membrane by the S2 subunit (Cavanagh, 2007). The S1 subunit is the major target for neutralizing antibodies and carries serotype-specific antigenic determinants (Liu et al., 2007). In addition to these roles, recently it was reported that S and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation of virulent IBV strains (Zhao et al., 2019). The genome of IBV includes the untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genome regions, which play a role in RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2007) and classification of IBV (Hewson et al., 2009). The 3\u2032-UTR is involved in the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis and has also been used to assess variations in emerging IBV strains and other members of coronavirus group 3 (Williams et al., 1993; Breslin et al., 1999).",

Organs were washed with PBS then grinded in presence of sterile Minimum Essential Media containing 5% antibiotics before centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 15 min at +4\u00b0C. Supernatants of grinded organs and swab samples were collected under sterile conditions.

Indeed, Bourogaa et al. (2009b) conducted experimental trials to evaluate tracheal and renal cross protection in chickens vaccinated by oculo-nasal instillation. The results showed a weak protection when H120 strain was used alone. There were no reduction in tracheal and kidney damage after a challenge with the strain TN20/00. On the other hand, the combination of heterologous serotypes, based on the vaccine strains (H120) and CR88, allowed a higher protection. Thus, a vaccination protocol that combines CR88 with H120 has since been applied. The following years, the variant strain 4/91 has been also introduced.",
