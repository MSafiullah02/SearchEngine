            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can lead towards death if left untreated. TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold. Results prove the supremacy of B-CNN for the identification of TB and non-TB sample CXRs as compared to counterparts in terms of accuracy, variance in the predicted probabilities and model uncertainty.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease that is designated among 10 highest causes of death and also the leading infectious disease above than human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [1] . Each year millions of people get infected with tuberculosis. In 2017, approximately 1.3 million deaths were recorded for HIV-negative people. Additionally, the number of deaths The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Sohail Jabbar . among HIV-positive were 3 million. The top estimation was that in total 10 million individuals suffered from TB infection disease in 2017. In which men were 5.8 million, women were 3.2 million and children were 1 million. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the affected tuberculosis individuals were from all countries and age groups, i.e., over 90% were adults whereas, 9% of people were living with HIV. Furthermore, WHO 2018 TB report listed 30 high TB burden countries from which eight highest TB affected countries were: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), Philippines (6%), Pakistan (5%), Nigeria (4%), Bangladesh (4%) and South Africa (3%). The other 22 countries were considered for 87% of the world's TB infected cases. Only 6% of global cases were in the European and American region (3% each) [1] . Moreover, WHO in its ''End-TB Strategy'' emphasizes on the timely and accurate diagnosis of TB in patients and recommends the use of chest radiography, or chest X-ray (CXR). While CXR is a commonly utilized tool for diagnosing pulmonary TB, the expertise of radiology interpretation is insufficient in TB dominant areas, which harm the efficacy of triaging and screening of TB [2] . For mass screening, an efficient and low-cost computer-aided solution can be vital for earlier identification of TB disease in developing countries [3] . In mass screening, precise disease identification and evaluation relies on the technologies that require image acquisition and image interpretation. The objective of these technologies is to overcome human interpretation issues such as restricted subjectivity, huge variations among human interpreters, high-cost and limited human resource and fatigue [4] . Such computer-aided solutions are likely to decrease the risk of false detections and facilitate mass screening efforts. These computer-aided solutions can highlight abnormalities and characterizes lung patterns to assist physicians and provide them with a second opinion. The identification of TB from CXRs is a challenging task that requires identification of patterns such as cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread and pleural effusions [5] . Figure 1 (a)-(c) shows sample CXR images where TB manifestation features are visible. White circles in Figure 1 (a) represent air space consolidation. In Figures 1(b) -(c), spots and shaded area with ribcage depicts, endobronchial spread and the pleural effusions appearances, which are highlighted with the help of white arrowheads. In contrast, Figure 1 (d) shows a normal CXR where lungs do not have any spots or shaded area other than the ribcage. As shown in Figure 1 (a)-(c) TB manifested regions are overlapping that makes TB identification a challenging and complex task.",

DL based CNNs are evolving as the foremost ML approach for computer vision [11] . CNN based extracted representations are useful for recognizing and localizing objects in natural images [12] . However, due to the lack of labeled training data CNN model leads towards overfitting [13] . Furthermore, the CNN utilizes the softmax [14] in the last layer to classify the CXR as TB and non-TB. Though, the Softmax tends to classify CXR with a higher probability which is incorrectly interpreted as model confidence. In Bayesian CNN (B-CNN) the dropout between weighted layers is incorporated which can be interpreted as an approximation Bayesian model. The B-CNN for TB diagnostic provides inference ability with confidence.",

In case of higher values of uncertainty, the decision should be verified by the radiologists. Due to low explicitly and challenging inference of standard TB screening procedures, level of uncertainty may increase [18] . To address this problem, we proposed a novel dropout based Bayesian convolutional neural network which is utilized to robustly identify TB manifested CXRs. The main contribution of our work are as follows; 1) Explored extensive literature to analyze radiograph screen schemes based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Through literature study we have identified the problem. 2) Deep learning based TB diagnosis scheme is presented for effective mass screening of CXRs. In the proposed scheme three CNN architectures inspired by VGG-19 are presented to diagnose TB manifestations. 3) Identification of the softmax function utilized at the end of CNNs can only classify the CXR as TB and non-TB with higher confidence which is error prone to the borderline TB cases. 4) B-CNN based model is presented to identify TB by considering the uncertainty factor that effects results.",

The machine learning approaches rely on hand crafted features selection [19] which may work for one scenario but, fail in another. Therefore, ML algorithms demonstrate not to be used full for mass TB screening. Chauhan et al. [6] extracted features from CXRs using Gabor filter, gist and variants of HOG like representing shape with a spatial pyramid kernel [20] and Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection [21] . The authors then used SVM [22] for classification and reported accuracy of 94.2% and 86.0% with gist and HOG features, respectively. Alfadhli et al. used SURF [7] for features calculation from varied window sizes used as input for SVM based classifier achieving 89% area under the curve (AUC) [15] . Hogeweg et al. presented a feature extraction and classification mechanism to compute local pixel characteristics. The method uses position features, texture features and features derived from the Hessian matrix. The hybrid active shape model pixel algorithm was used for classification. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) based accuracy of 84.7% was achieved [8] . Jaeger et al. presented a TB diagnostic scheme. The authors have experimented two features, i.e., features of object detection as set A, and features that are based on image retrieval as set B. furthermore, the set A comprises on histogram for intensity, gradient, magnitude, shape-descriptors, curvaturedescriptors, HoG and LBP. The set B comprises on descriptor such as Tamura-texture, edge and color, fuzzy-color, colorlayout [23] . In [24] , Yahiaoui et al. presented preliminary diagnosis of TB by using SVM for TB and non-TB manifestations. It involves private dataset for training and testing. The ML techniques for TB identification have achieved good results. However, these technique fails to address the uncertain cases due to features selection by human experts which are hand-crafted that may work for some certain scenarios and fail for others situations. On the other hand, DL based techniques are most suitable as the features and representations are extracted automatically from image data by using the pattern learning and back-propagation.",

            "text": "The identification accuracy is used to gauge the performance of proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN in comparison with other techniques from literature including: SVM [15] , AlexNet [12] , VGG16 [26] , VGG19 [26] , ResNet [42] , and CNN based methodologies proposed by Lopes and Valiati [25] and Sivaramakrishnan et al. [17] . For the experimentation and comparison, three baseline CNN architectures are proposed, which are presented in Table 2 including Architecture-1, Architecture-2, and Architecture-3. The baseline CNN architectures are trained and tested separately for both datasets including Montgomery and Shenzhen [23] . Moreover, the results from Table 3 clearly depicts that all of the proposed CNN architectures outperformed the state-of-the-art DL approaches from the literature in terms of identification accuracies in case of Montgomery. For both datasets, the Architecture-2 shows highest identification accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art DL approaches along with Architecture-1 and Architecture 3. Figure 5 (a) elucidates a graphical representation of achieved accuracy for all three proposed baseline-CNN architectures. The baseline-CNN architectures are trained and tested for both Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets. It can be observed that the proposed baseline-CNNs including Arc-1, Arc-2 and Arc-3 correctly predicted TB manifestation and achieved 89.47%, 92.85% and 90.22% test-time prediction accuracy respectively for Montgomery dataset. For Shenzhen dataset, the baseline-CNN Arc-1, Arc-2 and Arc-3 achieved 78.57%, 78.57% and 82.14% test-time prediction accuracy respectively. The test-time accuracy results clearly depict that proposed baseline-CNN arc-2 outperforms other two proposed baseline CNNs. Figure 5 (b) demonstrates results for Bayesian-based CNNs architectures. The test-time prediction accuracy of all three architectures, i.e., Arc-1, Arc-2 and Arc-3 is increased after incorporating Bayesian. The improved prediction accuracy of all architectures is 90.22%, 96.42%, 92.85% respectively for Montgomery. The accuracy of all three B-CNN for Shenzhen dataset is also improved such as Arch-1 achieved 82.14%, Arch-2 achieved 86.46% and, Arch-3 achieved 85.71% test-time prediction accuracies respectively. The results show that Arch-2 B-CNN dominates over other two architecture of B-CNN. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed scheme we have compared the results of Acr-2 B-CNN with other stateof-the-art schemes. From Figure 6 it can be observed that the proposed Arch-2 B-CNN model accurately predicted the TB manifestations with test-time prediction accuracy 96.42% for Montgomery and 86.46 % for Shenzhen respectively. Whereas for the same experimental settings the other state-ofthe-art schemes such as SVM, pertained-CNN1, pertained-CNN2, AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet achieved 79.1%, 82%, 75.8%, 71.42%, 75%, 78.57%, 82.14% respectively for Montgomery dataset. The prediction accuracy results for Shenzhen dataset are 84%, 85.5%, 84.21%, 81.20%, 84.21%, 83.45% respectively for pertained-CNN1, pertained-CNN2, AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet. Result show that proposed Acr-2 B-CNN model performs better as compared to state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, Figure 7 (a-b) shows the predictive probabilities of softmax and confidence of B-CNN respectively for TB and Non-TB cases from the Shenzhen dataset. It can be observed from both graphs that softmax tends to be at the extreme in most of the cases which shows its unrealistic behavior. On the contrary, B-CNN provides realistically looking confidence since various examples may vary in confidence regarding their association with classes. VOLUME 8, 2020 After applying a threshold of 0.1 for TB and non-TB samples from Shenzhen dataset the variance is up to 10.4% of the false negatives (wrong prediction of TB CXRs) and 4.5% of the false positives (wrong prediction of non-TB CXRs) are declared as confusion cases from Shenzhen dataset, respectively. The CXRs which are declared as confusion cases are wrongly predicted by CNN architectures. However, the B-CNN model has either correctly classified those CXRs or has assign them as confusion cases that gives a chance to an expert radiologist for making the final decision. In Figure 9 , we further investigated the utility of B-CNN. we have compared the model variance to filter confusion cases after applying threshold on all the TB and non-TB samples from Shenzhen dataset. The prediction accuracy achieved by CNN for TB-samples 80.6%, whereas B-CNN achieved prediction accuracy of 91.04%. For non-TB sample, baseline-CNN achieved prediction accuracy of 90.91% in-comparison to B-CCN achieved prediction accuracy of 96.97%. Proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN not only improves the accuracy of TB identification from the CXRs but also validates its prediction. Furthermore, B-CNN can correctly classify up to 93.9% that is either the CXR belongs to TB or non-TB status or is a marginal confusion case that needs to be examined by expert radiologists. Results show that CNN Arc-2 achieves 85.7% accuracy whereas proposed B-CNN achieves 93.9% accuracy using Shenzhen dataset. The effectiveness of B-CNN over baseline CNN models can be further analyzed by Figure 10 that shows the TB prediction results on Shenzhen dataset. Figure 10 The CXR in Figure 10 (a) is incorrectly predicted as positive for TB by baseline CNN model. However, the proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN model correctly predicted it as a non-TB sample. The baseline CNN architectures and B-CNN model wrongly predicted the CXRs in Figure 10 (b) to Figure 10 (e); however, the B-CNN model lowered the prediction confidence and showed confusion on those CXRs in comparison to baseline CNN architectures. Moreover, the variance in the prediction of CXRs in Figure 10 (b) to Figure 10 (e) is more than 0.1. Thus by applying a threshold on the variance of predicted CXRs the wrongly predicted CXRs fall into the confusion cases. This proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is significant and novel as it characterizes the wrongly predicted CXRs as confusion cases which can be further analyzed by an expert radiologist. The diagnostic of contagious diseases is crucial through computer-aided solutions as mentioned in the future work of DSW Ting et al. [18] , there is a need to validate the results of diagnostic. In our work, the proposed B-CNN based TB identification validates its results by utilizing the uncertainty. It shows higher uncertainty where the model faces confusion or wrongly predicts marginal cases among the TB and non-TB manifestations. However, the state-ofthe-art DL approaches tend to wrongly predict the borderline TB and non-TB manifestation cases with higher confidence which leads to erroneous prediction. It shows that rather than making classification decisions on model confidence only, the inclusion of uncertainty can improve the decision process.",

            "text": "TB identification is a challenging task due to the occurrence of complex and obscured patterns present in CXRs. Numerous TB identification approaches are proposed in the literature. However, the accuracy of TB identification is still low. Recently, DL based approaches have presented significant results for TB identification by discovering complex features from large datasets. However, conventional deep learning based models are not capable to suggest uncertainty for output class prediction. Proposed B-CNN exploits the model uncertainty and Bayesian confidence to improve the accuracy of TB identification as well as validation of the results. The dropout is utilized at the training and testing phase to acquire the posterior probability distribution of the classes. The variance in probabilities is utilized as uncertainty and the mean of the posterior probability distribution of the classes is used to make the final output classification decision. The proposed methodology based on B-CNN has experimented on two TB benchmark datasets: Montgomery and Shenzhen. The results have demonstrated that the proposed methodology achieved highly significant results in terms of TB identification accuracy, i.e., 96.42% and 86.46% for both datasets (i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen) in comparison with the state-of-the-art DL approaches in the literature. Furthermore, by utilizing the variance of proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN a threshold of 0.1 is applied to filter out the confusion cases of the Shenzhen dataset. The applied threshold helped to capture the 10.4% of false negative and the 4.5% of false positive as confusion cases. These confusion cases improve the classification in terms of validation up to 93.9% that is either the CXR belongs to TB or non-TB status or is a marginal confusion case that needs to be examined by an expert radiologist. This proposed work shows compelling results and provides an improved foundation for future work. However, the real challenge is to determine that, how such DL systems will accurately fit with the workflow for diagnostic of thorax diseases and clinical screening settings. In future, we shall focus on potential validation that will provide a robust approach to deal with multiple thorax diseases from CXRs. Furthermore, BCNN models shall be utilized to eliminate uncertainty factor in natural images classification.",
