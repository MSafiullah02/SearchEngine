Infected individuals shed virus into the environment by coughing or sneezing, or even during quiet breathing. Virus shed during coughing and sneezing is often present in large droplets that fall out of the air within a short distance. If the virus falls on a surface and survives, it can be transmitted when someone touches the infected surface and then touches their nose, eyes or mouth. Virus is also spread by the airborne route in the form of small (<5\u00b5m) droplet nuclei that can remain suspended for long periods of time and can be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract. The relative contribution of different particle sizes and of direct contact versus airborne transmission as a means of spread differs among the respiratory viruses. Influenza viruses are spread by contact as well as by airborne transmission, but the mode of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being discussed. Some viruses are more fragile than others; for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most important respiratory virus in early childhood does not survive for long on inanimate surfaces, while coronaviruses are much more stable in the environment (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Infection control and prevention strategies are designed based on these features.",

For example, avian influenza A viruses infect ciliated epithelial cells while human influenza viruses infect non-ciliated epithelial cells. The presence of specific host cell molecules that are receptors for viral attachment and entry are the main determinants of which cells get infected. Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020) as well as for human coronavirus NL63. The receptor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and human coronavirus 229E uses aminopeptidase N as its receptor. All influenza viruses use sialic acid as their receptor but there is an added subtlety; human influenza viruses bind sialic acids with \u03b12,6 -linked oligosaccharides while avian influenza viruses bind sialic acids with \u03b12,3linked oligosaccharides (reviewed in (Paules and Subbarao, 2017) When host cells are infected by viruses, Type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines are expressed, cellular translation is suppressed, and an antiviral state is induced.",

Circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor complexes indirectly activate many cell types including endothelial cells, resulting in a flood of systemic cytokine production that contributes to hypotension and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

A puzzling phenomenon has been seen in COVID-19 pneumonia: some patients have extremely low blood oxygen levels, yet they do not complain of breathlessness. It has been suggested that oxygen uptake in COVID-19 pneumonia is impeded because of clogged and constricted blood vessels in the lungs rather than due to congestion from accumulation of edema fluid in the alveoli, as is seen in other viral pneumonias. The benefit of anticoagulants in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease is therefore of great interest. It is becoming clear that the pathogenetic cascade triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection damages many organs in the body, from the kidney to the brain.

As the pandemic evolves, we are gaining a better understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying COVID-19 disease. Treatment strategies currently under study include antiviral agents, immunomodulators, antibodies and adjunctive therapies. (Thevarajan et al., 2020) . The lower panel illustrates optimal timing of potential interventions based on viral and immune kinetics. Immunomodulators are genetically engineered or organism-derived proteins that target specific parts of the immune system. ",

            "text": ". The presence of cells in the respiratory tract expressing the relevant viral receptor is critical for initiation of viral infection and the clinical presentation depends on where these cells are situated in the respiratory tract. For example, if cells bearing the viral receptor are only present in the upper respiratory tract, infection is likely to be limited to rhinitis (characterized by a runny nose and stuffiness) or pharyngitis (sore throat) (Figure 1). In contrast, if the viral receptor is present on cells in the lower respiratory tract (e.g. epithelial cells expressing \u03b12,3 linked sialic acids beyond the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs), the infecting virus (e.g. avian influenza A(H5N1) virus) causes lower respiratory tract infection. After attachment to the receptor, the virus gains entry into the cell and the viral genome is uncoated releasing the viral genetic material, which is RNA in paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and DNA in adenoviruses. Viral transcription to produce viral proteins and viral replication to copy the viral genome are complex events that are unique to each viral family and occur in specific cellular compartments, though all viruses have crucial interactions with host cell proteins. The replication of paramyxoviruses including RSV and parainfluenza viruses occurs in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Influenza viruses are replicated entirely within the nucleus and they utilize a unique strategy of 'stealing' methylated capped ends of host cell messenger RNA (mRNA) as primers for viral mRNAs. The replication cycle of coronaviruses occurs entirely in the cytoplasm and involves the generation of a series of subgenomic RNAs. Progeny virions are released from the infected cell into the respiratory tract, where they are shed by coughing and sneezing.",

Infection of the nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal mucosa cause a runny nose, cough, sneezing and sore throat while tracheobronchitis or croup presents with a characteristic barking seal-like cough. Bronchitis refers to inflammation of the bronchi and presents with a cough; bronchiolitis, involving the smaller distal airways is characteristic of RSV infection in young infants and presents with wheezing. Pneumonia occurs when infection and inflammation involve the alveoli and lung parenchyma and is associated with a cough and shortness of breath. Rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and human coronavirus infections are usually limited to the upper respiratory tract; parainfluenza viruses cause croup; RSV causes bronchiolitis and influenza, SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia (Figure 1). Sometimes respiratory viral infections are complicated by secondary bacterial infection, particularly in the middle ear (otitis media) or lungs (pneumonia). The best example of this is secondary bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus following influenza virus infection. During the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics, a large proportion of the deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.The immune response to respiratory viruses.

Clinical improvement in need for oxygen support and mechanical ventilation were reported with the use of remdesivir in a compassionate use study, where the drug was used in patients with severe disease outside a clinical trial when no other treatments were available. A placebo-controlled RCT of remdesivir in China failed to demonstrate a statistically significant clinical benefit in treated patients (Wang et al., 2020) but interim analysis from a large international clinical trial revealed that treatment with remdesivir reduced the duration of hospitalization by an average of 4 days.

However, viruses employ several strategies to inhibit antiviral immunity in the host.
