As of August 2017, there have been 2066 laboratory confirmed cases with 720 fatalities (CFR 34.8%) reported to the World Health Organization.1 MERS cases have been identified from 27 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, the US, and Asia. New MERS cases continue to be detected. The CDC is continuing surveillance for MERS cases and outbreaks in the United States. Our current diagnostic algorithm for identification of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific serum antibodies in patients with a suspected history of MERS\u2010CoV infection includes initial screenings by indirect ELISA using MERS\u2010CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, and then confirmation with immunofluorescent staining of MERS\u2010infected cells, and microneutralization titration (MNt) assays.2 Other international groups are primarily using a combination of indirect ELISA against the spike (S) protein with confirmatory neutralization assays.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 S1 ELISAS have been found to correlate well with neutralizing antibodies.9 As the spike (S) protein is the target of neutralizing antibodies, we are now including it in our diagnostic algorithm. In the current study, we report validation of an S indirect ELISA to be used in combination with N ELISA and MNt in identification of MERS\u2010CoV specific serum antibodies in patients with a history of MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

The donor identity was held only by Emory University Transfusion Services and was not released to the CDC in accordance with both institutions approved IRB protocols. The samples used in these studies were de\u2010identified and analyzed anonymously. Serum from a confirmed MERS\u2010CoV patient was used as a positive control for all of our assays. The positive control serum was collected from the first imported case of MERS\u2010CoV into the United States during the case investigation, with a neutralizing reciprocal endpoint titer of 320.10The panel of nine serum from patients with MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies were collected during a 2015 outbreak investigation and during a follow\u2010up investigation from a 2012 MERS\u2010CoV outbreak in Jordan.11 Specimens were prepared by the Jordan Central Public Health Laboratory (Amman, Jordan) and shipped to the CDC for testing. Personal identifiers are not held by the CDC and the CDC's IRB have deemed use of the sera as non\u2010human subjects research (research determination 2015 6446). Human serum with high titers to human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63 were collected during coronavirus investigations and were to examine assay cross reactivities. Personal identifiers are not head with these samples, and therefore CDC's IRB have deemed use of the sera as non\u2010human subjects research (research determination 2017_DVD_Thornburg_328).

ROC analysis was performed to calculate the diagnostic sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) of the assay. At a standard screening dilution of 1:400, the sensitivity of the S ELISA remained at 89% or greater at ODs <0.51 (Figure 1C). Specificity increased to 89% at an OD of 0.09 and 100% at 0.39 (Figure 1C). At serum dilutions of 1:800 and 1:1600, the S ELISA remains highly specific, but loses sensitivity at higher ODs as can be expected (Figures 1D and 1E). For the sake of comparison, ROC analysis of MERS\u2010CoV N ELISA is shown for true positive and true negative sera at the screening dilution of 1:400 (Figure 1F).

Sera from patients with OC43 and HKU1 faintly detected MERS\u2010CoV N protein (Figure 2B). Sera from patients with 229E, OC43, and HKU1 also faintly detected MERS\u2010CoV S protein. More cross reactivity was seen between SARS serum and MERS\u2010CoV S protein (Figure 2B). Serum from the MERS\u2010CoV patient strongly detected both MERS\u2010CoV N and S as expected. These results suggest that while there is some weak cross reactivities between both MERS\u2010CoV N and S proteins and sera from patients who had a history of other coronavirus infections, the S cross reactivities are not strong enough to result in a positive signal by ELISA. While there have been studies suggesting there may be some cross reactivity between SARS patients sera and MERS\u2010CoV, our study is limited by the availability of only one patient serum.14\n",

We are opting to retain both N and S ELISAs during our MERS\u2010CoV serological screening process. We believe that MERS\u2010CoV N and S ELISAS are complementary for several reasons. First, as demonstrated by ROC analysis of S and N, at lower ODs, the S ELISA is more specific, while the N ELISA retains higher sensitivity across a large range of ODs. These data are not consistent with one publication examining serial blood draws from a single MERS\u2010CoV patient has suggested their S ELISA is more sensitive than an N ELISA.15 We have observed significant patient\u2010to\u2010patient differences in the quality and quantity of polyclonal antibody responses, and these conflicting data may be simply explained by human variation in immune response.",
