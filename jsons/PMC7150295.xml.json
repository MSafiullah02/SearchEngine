            "text": "The life objective of any organism is to reproduce, and a pathogen is an organism that can cause disease in its host while attempting to achieve this goal. There are five major types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that are considered prokaryotic because they do not have the \u201ctrue\u201d nucleus found in eukaryotes. The prokaryotic nucleus lacks a nuclear membrane and the genetic material of these organisms is usually contained in a single linear chromosome. Extracellular bacteria do not have to enter host cells to reproduce, while intracellular bacteria do. At this point, the reader should take a moment to familiarize him- or herself\nwith the common terms and concepts used in classifying or discussing bacteria (Box 22-1\n). Viruses are not considered to be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Viruses are acellular particles consisting of a protein coat (called a capsid) encasing a genome of either DNA or RNA. Due to their small size, viruses can only be observed with an electron microscope. To propagate, a virus must enter a host cell possessing protein synthesis machinery that the virus can exploit. Parasites and fungi are eukaryotic organisms that possess several chromosomes contained in a membrane-bounded nucleus. Parasites all share the characteristic of taking advantage of and being dependent on a host organism for both habitat and nutrition at some point in their life cycles, usually damaging the host but not killing it. The major classes of parasites are the protozoa, which are single-celled organisms, and the helminth worms, which are multicellular. While some parasites may be only a few micrometers in size, many are significantly larger, with some worms reaching several meters in length. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can exist comfortably outside a host but that will invade and colonize a host if given the opportunity. Fungi may be single-celled, as in the case of yeast, or multicellular, as in bread molds. Prions are curious entities that are infectious but appear to be made entirely of protein and lack any type of nucleic acid. Prions cause disease by altering normal proteins in the brain of the infected host.Box 22-1Classification of bacteriaBacteria have been traditionally classified on the basis of their shapes and groupings, their use of oxygen, and their gram stain status. Despite the advent of DNA technology, these terms of reference remain entrenched in the microbiological research community. For our discussions of bacteria in the context of immunology, we have divided the bacteria into the \u201cextracellular\u201d and \u201cintracellular\u201d categories, depending on where they live in the body in relation to host cells. Both these categories contain members of each of the groups described here.Shapes and GroupingsBacterial cells come in various shapes and groupings that are associated with specific nomenclature. The most common bacterial shapes are rod-like, which are the bacilli (\u201clittle staffs\u201d; singular is \u201cbacillus\u201d); spherical or ovoid, which are the cocci (\u201cberries\u201d; singular is \u201ccoccus\u201d); and comma forms and spirals. Bacteria may also be star-shaped or square, although these shapes are less common. Cocci are commonly grouped in pairs (diplo), chains (strepto) or clusters (staphylo), giving rise to diplococci, streptococci, and staphylococci. Bacilli are found in pairs and chains, giving rise to diplobacilli and streptobacilli. Spirals are usually found singly, but may occur as spirilla (rigid helix) or spirochetes (\u201cflexible helix\u201d). Vibrios are comma-shaped bacteria.Use of OxygenMicrobes in general and bacteria in particular are often described with respect to their use of oxygen. Those that can use oxygen are called aerobes, while those that do not are called anaerobes. A microbe that uses oxygen when available but can live anaerobically in the absence of oxygen is said to be a facultative aerobe. Those microbes that must have oxygen to survive are called obligate aerobes, while those that can grow only in the complete absence of molecular oxygen are called obligate anaerobes.\n\n\nGram Stain StatusBacteria are also classified into two groups according to how they appear when stained in the laboratory using the multi-step gram stain procedure developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram. One group of bacteria has cell walls with many layers of peptidoglycan interwoven with both lipotechoic and techoic acid. These relatively thick cell walls retain the dark purple color imposed by the initial step of the staining procedure despite undergoing a later decolorizing step and counterstaining with the red dye safranin. Bacteria staining purple in this fashion are called \u201cgram-positive\u201d bacteria. The other group, called \u201cgram-negative\u201d bacteria, have a cell wall with a thin peptidoglycan layer that loses its integrity during the staining procedure, allowing decolorization to occur. The purple color vanishes, allowing the cells to stain red with safranin. As well as peptidoglycan, the gram-negative cell wall has an outer plasma membrane containing lipopolysaccharide macromolecules composed of Lipid A (conserved among all gram-negative species) and an O-linked polysaccharide (O-PS; variable among gram-negative species). Functionally, the O-linked polysaccharide confers virulence (the ability to infect host cells) on the bacterium. It is the Lipid A moiety that functions as an endotoxin capable of inducing the endotoxic shock described in Box 17-2.Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can also be distinguished by their differential susceptibility to physical assaults as well as various enzymes and drugs. For example, gram-positive bacteria resist dry conditions better than gram-negative bacteria and cannot be crushed as readily. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to lysozyme digestion and killing by streptomycin and tetracycline, but are highly susceptible to penicillin, anionic detergents, and basic dyes. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria resist lysozyme digestion and killing by penicillin but dry out easily, are inhibited by basic dyes, and are susceptible to killing by tetracycline.Panel B adapted from \u201cMicrobiology, An Introduction,\u201d 6th and 7th edns.

To establish an infection, the invader must first penetrate the anatomic and physiological barriers that guard the skin and mucosal surfaces of the host. Secondly, the organism must be able to survive in the host cellular milieu long enough to reproduce. This replication may or may not cause visible, clinical damage to the host tissues, symptoms that we call \u201cdisease.\u201d It should be noted that sometimes the products released by a pathogen, such as bacterial toxins, are sufficient to cause disease even in the absence of widespread pathogen colonization. An \u201cemerging infectious disease\u201d is a disorder that has come to light only within the past couple of decades, or is changing in character such that it has an increased impact on the global population.

This damage results in immunopathic disease symptoms. CTLs may directly induce the lysis of bystander host cells via cytotoxic cytokine secretion, or phagocytes may release antimicrobial factors (like H2O2 or free radicals) that are also toxic to host cells. A very dramatic example of immunopathic damage occurs in mice infected in the brain with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Elsewhere in the body, this virus is quite harmless to the animals. In the brain, however, the CTL response to the virus results in neuron cytolysis that kills the mice. The endotoxic shock triggered by the LPS of gram-negative bacteria (refer to Box 17-2) is another example of immunopathic damage. Several other examples are given in Table 22-2\n.",

Many factors affect virulence: how quickly the pathogen can access a host cell and/or replicate, whether the pathogen can express molecules that damage the host or dampen its immune response, and whether the host MHC and PRR molecules can recognize the pathogen's processed peptides and PAMPs, respectively. If the immune system is able to eliminate the organism before it can successfully propagate, the infection is said to have been abortive. If, however, the pathogen multiplies despite the actions of the immune system, the infection is productive. Whether an infection is abortive or productive depends on the initial dose of the pathogen accessing the host, the virulence of the organism, and the strength and rapidity of the immune responses mounted to combat the invasion. The latter will be determined in part by whether the host has been previously exposed to the pathogen in question. In the last phase of a productive infection, the progeny of the pathogen escape the original host and travel to new ones.",

The interval between the time of infection and the onset of disease is called the incubation time, which can vary considerably in length depending on the lifestyle of the pathogen. An infection is said to be acute when it causes disease symptoms that appear rapidly but remain for only a short time. A persistent infection is one in which the pathogen remains in the host's body for prolonged periods or possibly throughout life. Persistent infections may result in chronic disease if symptoms are experienced on an ongoing or recurring basis. In other cases, a persistent pathogen may lurk for an extended time without producing any symptoms, in which case the infection is latent. A pathogen may or may not be infectious during latency. A person with a latent infection that can be transmitted unknowingly to others is a carrier.\n",

Naturally, the pathogens, whose evolution occurs much more rapidly than that of their hosts, have responded with the development of various \u201cevasion strategies\u201d designed to outwit or compromise the host's immune response. For example, a host population may be resistant to a certain pathogen because of an effective neutralizing antibody response that prevents the pathogen from gaining a foothold on host cells. However, if the pathogen undergoes a mutation that allows it to make novel use of a host surface protein to enter the cell, the pathogen can escape the humoral response.

            "text": "As described in Chapter 20, the first lines of defense encountered by any pathogen are the intact skin and mucosae. The vast majority of microorganisms cannot penetrate the tough keratin layer protecting the epidermis, and any pathogen arriving on the skin surface has to compete with the commensal flora for space and nutrients. Furthermore, the routine shedding of skin layers often deposes a pathogen before it has a chance to establish a firm foothold. Similarly in the mucosae, pathogens ingested into the gut or inhaled into the respiratory tract are for the most part trapped by mucus and secretory IgA coating the mucosal surfaces. Microbicidal molecules in the body secretions and the low pH and hydrolases in the gut also take their toll. However, should there be a wound in the skin or the mucosae that allows a pathogen access to tissues underlying the epithelium, the consequences can be severe. Some organisms are opportunistic pathogens, in that they do not cause disease unless offered an unexpected opportunity by a failure in host defense. Staphylococcus aureus is an example of an extracellular bacterium that is not particularly invasive and that normally colonizes the skin surface without harming the host. If inhaled, S. aureus is successfully repelled by an intact respiratory epithelial layer. However, should the skin experience a tear or the respiratory epithelium be damaged by trauma or another more invasive pathogen, S. aureus can take advantage of the breach and establish a serious infection. When the opportunity arises to invade the respiratory tract, staphylococcal pneumonia can result. Opportunistic invasions are a major problem in hosts immunocompromised either by disease or by design. For example, patients on immunosuppressive therapy following a tissue transplant, or those whose immune systems have been destroyed by HIV, are vulnerable to infection by the opportunistic pathogens Pneumocystis carinii and Candida albicans.\n",

Still other pathogens exploit host surface molecules as receptors, inducing receptor-mediated internalization.

            "text": "Most times, a pathogen that succeeds in penetrating the skin or mucosae either through a wound or via exploitation of host cell receptors meets effective innate defense in the form of subepithelial macrophages and NK cells and intraepithelial \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (Fig. 22-1\n). (Table 22-3\ncontains a list of the abbreviations used in the figures in this chapter.) Molecules on the pathogen surface may be recognized directly by the PRRs of resident macrophages, by the activatory receptors of NK cells, and by the restricted TCRs of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NKT cells. Inflammatory responses are mounted that first draw neutrophils into the site of incursion. Different types of pathogens elicit the production of different classes of chemokines that facilitate the inflammatory response. For example, acute infection by an extracellular gram-positive bacterium such as Streptococcus pneumoniae results in the production of predominantly CXC chemokines, particularly IL-8, that summon the neutrophils required to eliminate the bacteria. The lipopolysaccharides of the cell walls present in gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli are also powerful inducers of CXC chemokine secretion. In contrast, infection with a bacterial spirochete such as Borrelia burgdorferi leads to a more chronic condition eventually requiring action by macrophages and lymphocytes. Infection with this extracellular organism provokes the secretion by activated macrophages of CC (e.g., MCP-1) or C (e.g., lymphotactin) chemokines that attract the required cells.",

Complement components that either have leaked into the tissue from the blood or were produced by cells in the site of attack may be activated by either the alternative or lectin pathways. The pathogen will then be coated in C3b or C3d, enhancing phagocytosis via complement receptors on phagocytes. MAC-mediated destruction of the pathogen may also ensue if a membranous structure is present. Other complement components serve as chemoattractants, drawing more phagocytic cells to the site of attack. After phagocytes have engulfed an invader, molecules such as lactoferrin are introduced into the phagosome to sequester iron atoms, further inhibiting bacterial growth. Despite all these measures, a pathogen may avoid phagocytosis, opsonized or otherwise, and access the blood circulation. Bacteremia, viremia, and parasitemia are terms referring to the presence in the blood of bacteria, viruses, or parasites, respectively. Innate defense in the blood falls to blood monocytes and neutrophils. Should the pathogen reach the liver or the spleen, the macrophages present in these organs attempt to confine the invader.

The products of many species of bacteria and protozoa (particularly lipopolysaccharides) are potent activators of DCs, promoting their maturation into fully competent APCs. As well, the DNA of some parasites and bacteria, particularly if it is unmethylated, can activate DCs via binding to TLR9. The DNA of these organisms, but not that of vertebrates, contains stretches of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine residues called CpG motifs. TLR9 appears to be specific for these motifs. Lipopolysaccharides also induce the upregulation of the B7 molecules, CD40, and MHC class I and II on the DC surface, and promote DC migration to the secondary lymphoid tissues. Cytokine production by DCs, including TNF, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, and LFN\u03b1/\u03b2, is induced. The arrival of activated, antigen-bearing macrophages and DCs in the local lymph node stimulates the activation of naive T and B cells. The adaptive immune response then proceeds in its bid to eliminate the pathogen.

The pathogen is transmitted to humans by way of tick bites. Various species of Leptospira cause leptospirosis, a disease characterized by acute fever that can lead to liver and kidney damage. Contact with urine from leptospiruric animals (including pet dogs) is the primary route of transmission to humans. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by invasion of the genital mucosae by Treponema pallidum. The pathogen replicates rapidly at first but then can enter a latent phase. Recurrences erupting several years after the initial infection can lead to damage of the aorta, central nervous system, eyes, and ears.",

This large, gram-positive extracellular bacterium is a common pathogen of hoofed livestock and range animals. It lives in the soil of farm and range lands and produces spores that can survive in soil for decades. While B. anthracis infection occurs commonly in livestock, it rarely infects humans. Indeed, prior to the bioterrorism attacks through the postal system in the United States in the fall of 2001, the last case of inhalation anthrax in the United States was recorded in 1976. When B. anthracis does infect a human, the resulting anthrax disease takes one of three forms: inhalation (the most lethal), cutaneous, and gastrointestinal. If left untreated, any type of anthrax can lead to septicemia and death. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common form, usually occurs after introduction into a skin abrasion of bacteria from contaminated meat, wool, hides, or leather of infected animals. Skin lesions develop within 12 days of exposure and become necrotic. Patients may also experience fever and lymph node swelling. Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs after consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated meat. Severe abdominal symptoms, including bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, occur within a week of exposure. Inhalation anthrax is contracted by breathing aerosolized spores of B. anthracis. It was originally thought that thousands of spores had to be inhaled to cause disease, but that number has been revised downward in light of the deaths of mail workers exposed to more modest bacterial loads. Within 7 days of exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis, symptoms resembling a viral respiratory illness ensue that rapidly progress to shock, respiratory failure, and sometimes meningitis. Death occurs in 75% of cases, even with aggressive antibiotic therapy.",

For example, infection with V. cholerae results in the local release of an exotoxin that binds to gut epithelial cells. A massive release of electrolytes and tissue fluids is induced that is manifested as the severe diarrhea that characterizes cholera. Although they are derived from extracellular bacteria, many bacterial exotoxins have the ability to translocate into mammalian cells and wreak havoc on intracellular processes. The diphtheria exotoxin secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae travels the body systemically and is absorbed by cells of the heart and peripheral nervous system. The toxin inhibits protein synthesis in these cells, leading to myocarditis and neuritis. The diphtheria exotoxin also promotes colonization of the throat by the bacterium, which provokes an acute inflammatory response resulting in severe respiratory obstruction. As mentioned previously, C. botulinum produces a neurotoxin that blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, resulting in paralysis. This toxin is much feared as a potential biological weapon because a dose of less than 1 \u03bcg is fatal to humans. Another Clostridium species, Clostridium tetani, synthesizes a neurotoxin that causes uncontrollable muscle contractions. Other exotoxins trigger specific host cell necrosis, such as the leukocidin produced by S. aureus that is toxic to granulocytes. Another example is the exotoxin produced by E. coli O157:H7, which causes severe hemorrhaging because it blocks protein synthesis within vascular endothelial cells and kills them. B. anthracis produces two exotoxins called lethal toxin and edema toxin that damage phagocytes in an unknown way. Lethal toxin is composed of a zinc protease called lethal factor and a protein called protective antigen, while edema toxin is composed of an adenylate cyclase called edema factor plus protective antigen.",

Antitoxins can also act as opsonins and enhance the clearance of the toxin by phagocytes. Sometimes secretory IgA can act as an antitoxin by preventing a toxin from making contact with and damaging a body tract such as the airway. If the toxin is the sole element causing disease in the host, the production of the antitoxin alone will be enough to restore health. For example, human resistance to tetanus relies on the presence of antibodies directed against the exotoxins produced by Clostridium tetani. The tetanus toxoid vaccination that we receive as infants (followed by tetanus boosters every 10 years) is a preparation of inactivated tetanus exotoxin that serves to induce and maintain the production of neutralizing antitoxin antibodies (see Ch. 23). Not surprisingly, antigenic variation can influence antitoxin effectiveness. For example, the composition of a bacterial exotoxin may vary slightly among strains such that an antitoxin generated in an exposure to one strain may not recognize the epitopes of exotoxin produced by a later infection with a second strain.

The capsule confers a charge and hydrophilic character to the bacterial surface that inhibits binding to phagocyte receptors. C3b may still attach to the bacterial surface, but the capsule sterically interferes with the binding of the phagocyte's receptors to the C3b. Instead, the host must synthesize opsonizing antibodies to allow a phagocyte to successfully attach to these invaders. Encapsulated bacteria therefore have more time (several days) than unencapsulated bacteria to reproduce undisturbed, making them more dangerous pathogens. For example, alveolar macrophages cannot engulf the encapsulated bacterium S. pneumoniae unless it is opsonized, allowing early establishment of the bacteria in the lungs. Eventually, antibodies to components of the capsule are made that facilitate destruction of the bacteria by complement-mediated lysis. However, if this tactic is not rapid enough, pneumonia can result. Those with deficits in the humoral response, such as the very young, the very old, and the immunocompromised, are especially susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria. To protect healthy adults at particular risk of exposure to these pathogens, a vaccine has been developed that contains the capsule components of several species (see Ch. 23).

            "text": "Evasion of the complement system is a time-honored strategy employed by a vast array of pathogens. Specific methods include avoiding recognition by complement proteins, removing any attached complement proteins, exploiting various host RCA (regulators of complement activation) proteins to either inactivate the complement cascade or gain access to a host cell, and expressing molecules that resemble host complement components or RCAs. Many anti-complement strategies employed by extracellular bacteria are shared by intracellular bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Box 22-3\nexplores in depth several of these tactics from the point of view of a particular complement system component.Box 22-3Avoidance of the complement system by pathogensThe complement system is a vital contributor to the defense of the host in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Naturally, therefore, pathogens have devoted much time and energy to devising ways to confound the complement system, or to make use of it for their own ends. Pathogens can avert complement-mediated destruction by presenting a cell surface that does not permit deposition of C3b (avoiding recognition); by shedding incipient complexes as they form; by destroying or inhibiting various complement proteins; by acquiring host RCA proteins; and/or by expressing molecules that closely resemble host RCA proteins. At any one time, a given pathogen may be able to use just one or several of these mechanisms to protect itself.A pathogen can avoid complement recognition if the surface moieties it expresses do not bind C3b or antibody well or at all. The surface glycoproteins of some parasites and capsules of some bacteria fit this description. For example, some species of gram-negative bacteria avoid detection by expressing LPS residues with unusual side chain sugars. These sugars mask the LPS determinants that would normally bind to C3b and activate complement via the alternative pathway. Another avoidance mechanism is the shedding of activatory surface moieties or immune complexes, as occurs for the parasites Schistosoma mansoni and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively. Some organisms express molecules that disrupt one or more complement activation pathways. For example, Protein H expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes binds to C1 but does not allow the cascade to proceed, competitively inhibiting the classical pathway. Several members of the poxvirus and herpesvirus families secrete proteins that block formation of the alternate C3 convertase. Even if either C3 or C1 has succeeded in initiating complement activation, many pathogens, such as the bacterium Escherichia coli and the parasite Leishmania major, respond by shedding the complex, particularly at the MAC formation stage. Proteolytic degradation and phosphorylation of complement components are also used by many organisms to derail MAC assembly before it can go too far. Some organisms (like certain Borrelia and Salmonella species) express proteins that inhibit the terminal complement proteins, so that C6 deposition is blocked or C9 polymerization is inhibited.Another effective strategy for blocking complement-mediated destruction is to acquire the host RCA proteins that normally protect host cells. Budding viruses take sections of the host cell membrane with them as they emerge, and embedded in the membrane are host RCA proteins. DAF and MIRL are acquired by HIV and vaccinia in this way. Other organisms express molecules that adsorb soluble RCA proteins from the host plasma. The host RCA proteins retain their regulatory activity even when bound to a bacterial surface, so that the alternative pathway of complement activation is inhibited. For example, the fluid phase RCA proteins Factor H and C4bp can be bound to the M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes. The C4bp\u2013M protein binding is completely sufficient to halt complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis. C4bp has also been shown to bind to all known strains of Bordetella pertussis. In Neisseria gonorrhea, both surface sialic acids and an outer membrane protein called porin can bind Factor H.Altering the expression of host RCA and CR proteins is another means of countering complement. Some intracellular pathogens induce new expression of RCA proteins to block complement-mediated destruction, thus preserving the pathogen's chosen home. For example, DAF and MCP expression are upregulated on cells infected with human CMV, and a modified form of DAF appears on cells infected with Plasmodium berghei. HIV downregulates the expression of CR1 and CR2 on the infected host cell, reducing opsonized phagocytosis. HIV also reduces the expression of C5aR by monocytes, decreasing the chemotaxis of these cells to sites of infection and inflammation. A related mode of pathogen defense is the expression of molecules that resemble host RCA proteins. Proteins with similar structures and functions to mammalian CR1, DAF, MCP, C4bp, and MIRL have been described in viruses such as vaccinia, KSHV, and HSV, as well as in parasites such as Schistosoma, Entamoeba, and Trypanosoma. Studies of Herpesvirus saimiri have shown that this virus has apparently acquired the cDNA for mammalian MIRL and incorporated it into the viral genome. The virus induces the expression of a GPI-anchored protein in the host cell membrane that closely resembles monkey MIRL and protects against MAC-mediated lysis.Lastly, some bacteria and parasites proteolytically inactivate complement cascade products such as the anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a. A lack of these molecules dampens the inflammatory response and gives the pathogen more time to multiply or hide. For example, a membrane-bound enzyme that removes the C-terminus of C5a is expressed on the surface of streptococci.",

Some species remain in the vacuolar compartment, while others leave it to take up residence in the cytosol. Because of their desire to replicate within a host cell and keep it alive for this purpose, intracellular bacteria are generally not very toxic to the host and do not produce tissue-damaging bacterial toxins. Because of their low toxicity, infections with intracellular bacteria have extended incubation times. However, their intracellular lifestyle makes infections with these organisms difficult to resolve completely. These factors mean that infections with intracellular bacteria tend to result in chronic or recurrent rather than acute disease. Cell-mediated immunity is crucial for combating infections by intracellular bacteria. Thus, immunocompromised individuals who lack the ability to mount cell-mediated immune responses are particularly at risk for infection with these pathogens.",

Salmonella typhi is an encapsulated, gram-negative enterobacterium that causes typhoid fever in humans. Salmonella typhimurium causes the equivalent of typhoid fever in mice. Humans can be infected by S. typhimurium if they eat improperly cooked meat from infected cattle. In this case, the infection results in food poisoning. Like all Salmonella species, S. typhi and S. typhimurium transcytose across M cells in the mucosae. However, unlike the extracellular Salmonella enteritidis bacteria, which cause poultry-related food poisoning, S. typhi and S. typhimurium invade macrophages to replicate and thus are intracellular pathogens. Another food-borne intracellular pathogen is Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive rod that infects the cytoplasm of macrophages and hepatocytes. L. monocytogenes causes meningeal or systemic infections most often in sheep and cattle but sometimes in humans. Unlike most bacteria, Listeria can multiply quite successfully at low temperatures, meaning that the infection continues to grow in contaminated food even when it is refrigerated. Listeria infection has also been associated with miscarriages and stillbirths in humans and cattle. Mouse models of Listeria infection (listeriosis) have been very helpful in discovering how the immune system combats intracellular pathogens (see later). However, for all its use in experimental models, it is not yet clear how L. monocytogenes makes its way across the intestinal barrier into the liver and spleen and finally across the blood\u2013brain barrier. Various Brucella species are transmitted to humans via contact with animals and result in high fevers. Rickettsia rickettsii is transmitted into the bloodstream via tick bites and proceeds to attack endothelial and smooth muscle cells, causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Legionella pneumophila, the relatively recently identified pathogen that causes the lung disorder known as \u201cLegionnaires\u2019 disease,\u201d replicates only within macrophages.",

The mycobacteria do not produce bacterial toxins and cause only mild inflammation on their own. However, these bacteria are extraordinarily hard to remove, and it is the prolonged host response to a mycobacterial infection that causes most of the tissue damage. Consider M. tuberculosis, a slow-replicating (12 hour) aerobic bacillus that gravitates to well-aerated tissues such as the lung. Tubercular disease associated with M. tuberculosis is caused not only by inflammatory damage in the lungs induced by the bacteria but also by the host's adaptive immune response. The persistence of the bacteria summons activated T cells that supply products and contacts that hyperactivate macrophages. The hyperactivated macrophages in turn secrete copious amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in lung damage. In addition, the macrophages may eventually form granulomas to wall off the bacteria. These granulomas are the \u201ctubercles\u201d (lumps or knobs) on the lungs that give the disease its name. Eventually, the inner circle of macrophages in the tubercles breaks down and the bacilli are released. If the body's defenses can arrest the disease effectively at this point, the lesion calcifies and becomes visible in X-rays as scarring on the lung. If the disease is not arrested, the bacilli persist and may become dormant for months or even years. At some point, when the immune system is weakened due to poor health, malnutrition, or other infections, the bacilli in the center of the tubercle may be able to proliferate again. However, in this situation, bacterial multiplication takes place outside macrophages for the first time. Should the tubercles rupture, millions of bacteria are released into the lungs. The patient becomes highly contagious at this point due to the release of bacilli during coughing episodes. From the lungs, the bacteria disseminate throughout the patient's body and induce the formation of seed-sized tubercles in infected tissues. Body defenses may be overwhelmed, leading to the weight loss, coughing (often with blood), and loss of vigor known collectively as \u201cconsumption.\u201d",

Indeed, 90% of individuals infected with M. tuberculosis remain clinically healthy. An asymptomatic patient is sometimes reluctant to continue with the long-term course of antibiotics needed to successfully treat the disease. A classical \u201cTB test,\u201d involving the cutaneous injection of tuberculin antigen (often called purified protein derivative; PPD) into the skin, indicates whether an individual is or has been infected with M. tuberculosis (and thus may still be harboring the bacterium) (Plate 22-1\n). A pronounced, reddened reaction on the skin around the inoculation site after about 48 hours is a DTH response: memory T cells responding to the inoculated antigen activate macrophages that produce cytokines inciting local inflammation. In the very young, a positive TB test probably means that an active TB infection is occurring. In older people, a positive test can result from either an active infection, or from a previous infection that has been cleared, or from vaccination. In these cases, follow-up testing is done by X-ray examination of the lungs, which can distinguish between an active and a calcified lesion. There may also be an attempt to culture the bacterium from the patient.

Attempts have been made to slow the spread of TB in such populations by antibiotic treatment and vaccination programs (see Ch. 23). However, it takes at least 6 months of intense chemotherapy to cure a TB patient because of the limited effectiveness of available drugs against entrenched M. tuberculosis. Moreover, poor patient compliance with this stringent regime has led to the rise of multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. In addition, administration of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strain of Mycobacterium bovis used as a vaccine against TB does not always induce complete cell-mediated immunity. These factors have led to a maddening persistence and recurrence of TB in susceptible populations. It is estimated that there are 2 billion people worldwide who are latently infected with M. tuberculosis, and that about 5\u201310% of these experience re-activation of the bacterium, leading to active disease.

The ability of a macrophage to kill phagocytosed bacteria is influenced by\nproteins that scientists are only now beginning to investigate. For example, mice that have a mutation of a gene called Nramp1 (natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1) have an increased susceptibility to BCG infections. Upon phagocytosis of a microbe during the innate response, the wild-type Nramp1 protein is recruited to the membrane of the macrophage phagosome and integrates within it. It is thought that the presence of Nramp1 in the phagolysosomal membrane somehow influences the microenvironment within the phagolysosome and hence its killing ability. Human homologues of Nramp1 have been found in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Another group of proteins important for the killing of intracellular pathogens (at least in mice) are the p47GTPases, a family of GTP-hydrolyzing proteins of 47\u201348 kDa. These transmembrane enzymes, whose expression is greatly upregulated in response to IFNs and LPS, are thought to be localized in either the ER or the Golgi. Functionally, the p47GTPases appear to regulate the maturation and processing of pathogen-containing phagosomes, hastening the demise of the invader. Interestingly, different members of the p47GTPase family are required for effective resistance to different classes of intracellular pathogens. Studies of knockout mice have shown that, while the p47GTPase Igtp is required for normal resistance to the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, it does not play a crucial role in defense against the intracellular bacteria L. monocytogenes or M. tuberculosis. In contrast, knockout mice lacking the p47GTPase Lrg47 are highly susceptible to infection with L. monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, or M. tuberculosis as well as L. major.\n",

As well, components derived from the degradation of a phagocytosed bacterium or antigens secreted by it can be released into the cytosol, allowing peptides from these molecules to be cross-presented on MHC class I. Such cells function as target cells for Tc in the local lymph node or memory CTLs in the periphery. For example, studies of L. monocytogenes have demonstrated that CD8+ CTLs are crucial for resolving infections with this pathogen. Mice deficient for either \u03b1\u03b2 TCR components or \u03b22m (and thus MHC class I) show decreased resistance to L. monocytogenes infection. Similarly, mice that are normally resistant to tuberculosis can be rendered susceptible if CD8+ T cells are depleted by treatment with antibodies prior to infection. However, cytolysis via the perforin or Fas pathways does not appear to be a big factor in CD8+ T cell-mediated defense against intracellular bacteria (unlike antiviral defense; see later). Studies in knockout mice have shown that Fas-mediated cytolysis is not required for any stage of host defense against L. monocytogenes or M. tuberculosis, and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is important only for containing disease in the chronic stages of L. monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis infections. Rather, CD8+ CTLs contribute to anti-bacterial defense primarily by releasing IFN\u03b3 and TNF, which are critical both for inflammatory cell influx and direct killing of infected cells, and by secreting granulysin, a molecule that has direct anti-microbial activity. Knockout mice deficient for the expression of either TNF or IFN\u03b3 or the receptors for these molecules show increased susceptibility to infections with L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, animals treated with anti-TNF or anti-IFN\u03b3 antibodies show increased susceptibility to listeriosis, while those treated with anti-IL-4 actually show increased resistance.

Consequently, internal damage to the phagocyte itself is prevented, and non-phagocytic cells (which do not create phagosomes) run no risk at all. In view of the compartmentalized nature of phagocytosis, intracellular bacteria can evolve in one of two ways to improve their chances of survival. They can either enter and replicate in non-phagocytic cells, or enter phagocytic cells and employ strategies to avoid phagolysosomal destruction. One example of an intracellular bacterium that targets a non-phagocytic cell is\nM. leprae, which infects Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. The Schwann cells, which wrap around the axons of nerves and generate the myelin sheath, express a surface protein called \u03b1-dystroglycan. This protein normally has a role in early development and morphogenesis, but in this case acts as a receptor for M. leprae. The microbe enters the Schwann cells and is protected from phagocytosis. Similarly, L. monocytogenes expresses internalin proteins that bind to the host adhesion molecule E-cadherin, allowing the bacteria to enter non-phagocytes. L. monocytogenes also deliberately accesses phagocytes using the host cell Fc and complement receptors, but then employs survival tactics to prevent killing within the phagosome. These tactics include the synthesis of the listeriolysin O protein mentioned previously. LLO induces pore formation in the membrane of the phagolysosome, allowing the bacterium to escape into the relative safety of the cytoplasm.",

First, when this bacterium finds itself being engulfed in a macrophage phagosome, it recruits a host protein called TACO (tryptophan-aspartate-containing coat protein) to the cytoplasmic surface of the developing phagosome. The presence of TACO inhibits the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes and other vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes and specialized killing components. Secondly, mycobacteria also produce NH4\n+, which reverses the acidification of phagolysosomes and promotes fusion with harmless endosomes. Thirdly, M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages interferes with STAT1-mediated transcriptional responses to IFN\u03b3 signaling, blocking the expression of genes needed for microbicidal action and hyperactivation. As a result of these three strategies, mycobacteria can survive within host phagosomes for long periods. The bacteria may remain active, or enter a state of dormancy in which many of their metabolic pathways are downregulated. Other intracellular bacteria focus on blocking the ROIs produced within the phagosome. The phenolic glycolipid found in M. leprae neutralizes ROIs, while other bacterial species produce superoxide dismutase and catalase that break down ROIs and hydrogen peroxide. Catalase may also inhibit the generation of RNIs.",

Still other bacterial products confer resistance to cationic peptides. These measures permit the Salmonella to survive within the macrophage for a relatively short period of time. However, because macrophages are mobile, the bacterial infection is quickly disseminated all over the body. In typhoid carriers, the disease becomes chronic, as the bacteria accumulate in the gall bladder and are shed for several months or even indefinitely into the feces. Transmission to fresh hosts is achieved under conditions of poor sanitation when the feces of an infected person enter the water supply consumed by non-infected individuals. An infected human does make antibodies to the capsule of S. typhi, and carriers have such antibodies in their plasma, but the antibody is not protective while the bacterium is hidden in the macrophages.

Ultrastructural studies have shown that, in host cells infected with L. monocytogenes, the bacterium induces the actin-based formation of a pseudopod that invaginates into a neighboring non-phagocytic cell. The neighboring cell engulfs the pseudopod (which contains the bacterium plus bits of the original host cell cytoplasm) and pinches it off to form a secondary vacuole surrounded by a double plasma membrane (Plate 22-4\n). The bacterium then uses LLO and phospholipases to forge its way through both sets of host membranes and enters the cytoplasm of the new host cell, free to start the cycle anew. The beauty of this tactic is that the bacterium is never extracellular, meaning that antibodies can never bind to it.

Unlike bacteria and parasites, which often give rise to chronic disease in cases of persistent infection, most viruses that persist in the body do so in a latent state. During latency, viral activity is held in check by cell-mediated immunity. The host experiences no symptoms and the virus remains in a non-infectious mode in which no new virus particles are assembled. However, as the host ages or faces immune system challenges such as other infectious agents, cancer, or immunosuppressive drug treatments, the cell-mediated response weakens. This weakening increases the likelihood that the latent virus will become reactivated, leading to recommencement of a productive infection with associated symptoms. A common example of this type of latent viral infection occurs with the virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV; also known as human herpesvirus 3, or herpes zoster). After an initial infection that results in the characteristic chicken pox rash, the virus moves up to the dorsal root ganglia of sensory nerves that reach into the skin and becomes latent, usually for years. Upon reactivation, the viral infection spreads down the affected nerves to the skin, causing the formation of vesicles called \u201cshingles\u201d that are very painful to the host and are teeming with infectious virus particles. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) acts in a similar way on nerves supplying the mouth area, giving rise to cold sores after a period of latency. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) persists in a latent infection that causes no symptoms and is not infectious as long as cell-mediated responses are intact and ongoing.

Upon entering the body, the virus replicates first in skeletal muscle and connective tissue. It then enters and spreads along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and CNS, where it eventually causes encephalitis. Initial symptoms are slow to develop, and may include irritability, fever, pain, and fatigue that can progress to hallucination and paralysis. The rabies virus readily infects cats, dogs, raccoons, foxes, bats, and skunks, all of which are creatures that interact quite frequently with humans. The bite of a rabid animal is usually fatal for humans unless a course of injections of protective anti-rabies antibodies is undertaken immediately (see Ch. 23). The virus replicates in slow waves, meaning that the passive supply of relatively short-lived antibodies must be replenished several times to ensure elimination of the virus.",

The reader will recall from Chapter 17 that IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 induce the synthesis of the host enzyme PKR, which is inactive until it encounters a dsRNA molecule such as a viral genome. Among other substrates, activated PKR phosphorylates first itself and then eIF2, a factor necessary for translation of both host and viral proteins. Since the virus relies on the host cell's translation machinery for viral protein synthesis, viral reproduction is halted. IFNs also induce expression of 2\u20135A synthetase, an enzyme activated by dsRNA that generates short 2\u2032,5\u2032 oligoadenonucleotides. These 2\u20135A molecules activate RNAse L, which degrades both viral and cellular RNAs, again blocking translation.

It seems that, unlike the case for any other cell type, low levels of viruses infecting hepatocytes are controlled solely by cytokine action that does not lead to cytolysis. For example, LCMV and mouse CMV are cleared from murine liver cells primarily by the action of CTL-synthesized IFN\u03b3, in sharp contrast to the cytolytic elimination of these viruses in other cell types. In a poorly defined mechanism, the binding of IFN\u03b3 to its receptor on an infected hepatocyte activates intracellular degradation of viral components, curing the cell without killing it. In the case of hepatocytes infected with HepB virus, both TNF and IFN\u03b3 must\nbind to their respective receptors on the hepatocyte surface to induce selective degradation of the viral genome as the virus replicates within the hepatocyte. Again, the threat is removed without killing the liver cell. Liver cells are killed when viral loads are high, because the heightened inflammatory response sparked by large numbers of virus particles recruits activated macrophages. In the cytokine-rich milieu of the inflamed liver, the macrophages commence expression of CD40L, which engages CD40 expressed on hepatocytes. This interaction induces FasL expression on hepatocytes, making them vulnerable to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Should FasL be engaged either by Fas on the surface of the same hepatocyte, or on an adjacent hepatocyte, cell death is induced, which can eventually lead to clinical liver damage. This type of liver pathology is prominent in severe cases of HepB and HepC infection in humans.",

A similar scenario holds for LCMV infection in mice. While antibody and CD4+ T cell responses do occur in response to LCMV infection, it is the CD8+ CTL cell response that is critical for defense.

The viral genome persists in only 0.01% of the neuron population but does not integrate into the host DNA. Rather, the viral genome forms a complex with host nucleosomal proteins that blocks transcription of productive infection genes. A new set of LATs is then transcribed to maintain latency.

The process occurs in two steps: the ATP-independent binding of peptides to the TAP heterodimer and the ATP-dependent translocation of the peptides into the lumen of the ER. In EBV-infected B lymphoma cells, the transcription of both TAP-1 and TAP-2 is downregulated, reducing peptide loading and thus presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells. Herpesviruses express small proteins that interfere with peptide binding to TAP on the cytosolic side of the ER. Other viruses express proteins that allow the peptide to bind to TAP but then trap the complex on the luminal side of the ER, blocking its release and subsequent interaction with MHC class I.",

Poxviruses and herpesviruses also express MHC class I homologues, many of which have deficits in peptide binding. We mentioned previously that the Nef protein of HIV depresses surface expression of MHC class I, blocking antigen presentation to CTLs. Interestingly, the expression of the non-classical MHC class I molecules HLA-C, HLA-E, and HLA-G is not affected by Nef, leaving at least some MHC class I-like molecules to bind to the inhibitory receptors of NK cells. The human CMV protein UL40 actually upregulates expression of HLA-E, increasing the numbers of non-classical MHC class I molecules able to bind NK inhibitory receptors. Curiously, some small viruses (such as the flavivirus West Nile virus) upregulate conventional host MHC class I expression in an infected cell in the hopes of staving off NK-mediated destruction. It is thought that this measure allows these rapidly reproducing viruses to complete their life cycle and disseminate long before the MHC class I-dependent CTL response can be brought to bear.",

The natural immune response to rabies is thus considerably delayed. Interestingly, because the virus replicates relatively slowly, an individual bitten by a rabid animal can be successfully treated with a post-exposure vaccine, as an alternative to the administration of anti-rabies antibodies. The rabies vaccine contains an inactivated form of the virus that is injected directly into regions of the body where APCs are present, rapidly inducing an immune response (see Ch. 23).

Similarly, vaccinia virus secretes an IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R homologue that intercepts IFN\u03b1, and an IFN\u03b3R homologue that binds IFN\u03b3. Myxoma virus also produces huge amounts of an IFN\u03b3R-like viral cytokine receptor called M-T7 that binds host C, CC, and CXC chemokines, disrupting leukocyte extravasation into infected tissues. The p35 protein expressed by vaccinia and other poxviruses acts like a decoy chemokine receptor although it does not structurally resemble one. P35 binds to CC chemokines with higher affinity than does the host receptor, sequestering host chemokine molecules and reducing the efficiency of the immune response. The M-T1 protein of myxoma virus is another secreted molecule that binds and inhibits several chemokines in vitro and blocks the influx of monocytes into sites of acute infection in vivo. The opposite strategy has been adopted by KSHV. The suspected natural host cells of this virus are endothelial cells and B cells. KSHV induces the expression of a viral transmembrane receptor called ORF74 in the host membrane. ORF74 closely resembles CXCR2, an IL-8 receptor. However, unlike CXCR2, ORF74 is constitutively active, constantly stimulating signaling pathways associated with the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The increase in VEGF production is thought to trigger the formation of new sites of vascularization, facilitating the spread of the virus to fresh host cells. ORF74 may also regulate the migration of virus-laden B cells to lymphoid organs. Here, virions released from lysing host cells would find fresh, susceptible B cells to infect, enhancing propagation of the virus.",

The first recognized function of semaphorins was one of conveying signals guiding the growth of axons during embryonic neuronal development, but the fact that certain viruses have apparently acquired the genes for semaphorins implies the subversion of some kind of immunological function. The genome of vaccinia virus contains the gene for a small semaphorin called A39R that has a truncated sema domain. When A39R expression is engineered in human monocytes, this protein downregulates ICAM-1 expression, induces synthesis of IL-8, TNF, and IL-6, and inhibits migration in response to chemoattractants.

They often replicate directly within host cells, including within leukocytes. Important protozoan parasites for humans are L. major, P. falciparum, and Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness (Table 22-11\n). At the other end of the scale, we have the parasitic worms. Many helminth species, which include the trematodes (flukes and worms that attack the lungs and liver), cestodes (tapeworms in the gut lumen), and nematodes (roundworms and hookworms, primarily in the intestinal lumen), are also major human pathogens. These organisms are complex, multicellular beasts that reproduce inside a host's body but outside its cells, or outside of the host entirely. However, in the latter case, millions of parasite eggs or larvae are often deposited in places (like water sources) where access to a host is made easy. The growth and maturation of the parasite then occur within the host.",

As well as taking steps to fight pathogen infections of humans, measures to control the mosquito or raccoon population must be implemented. From an individual's point of view, that fact that some parasite stages may be intracellular while others are extracellular means that the infected individual must be able to mobilize both the cell-mediated and humoral arms of the immune response to eliminate the pathogen.

When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected human to acquire a blood meal, it takes up RBCs bearing P. falciparum gametocytes. When the gametocytes reach the mid-gut of the mosquito, they commence maturation and 24 hours later combine to form worm-like zygotes that mature into ookinetes. Each ookinete penetrates into the mosquito's mid-gut wall, forms an oocyst, and starts to produce progeny called sporozoites within it. When an oocyst bursts, the sporozoites are released and migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands. When the infected mosquito bites a human, 5\u201320 sporozoites are injected into his or her subcutaneous tissues. Within minutes of injection, the sporozoites race through the blood to the liver and invade hepatocytes. In these cells, the sporozoites replicate asexually (and asymptomatically) for 2\u201310 days, producing thousands of merozoite progeny. The infected hepatocytes then lyse, each releasing 10,000\u201330,000 merozoites into the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and express parasite proteins on the RBC surface. Within the erythrocytes, the merozoites mature into schizonts that reproduce asexually and exponentially. The RBCs lyse 48 hours later, releasing new progeny merozoites into the blood, where they attack more erythrocytes. This synchronized rupture of the erythrocytes is felt as the cyclical constellation of chills, fever, and sweating that constitutes clinical malaria. These symptoms are due to the release of TNF and IL-1 by macrophages responding to the presence of lysed RBCs. However, not all RBCs are lysed by the merozoites. Within some infected RBCs, the merozoites develop into the sexual male and female gametocyte forms. These gametocytes can persist for years in the host.

Only 1% of newly infected individuals show symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and a distinctive swelling at the site where the triatomine accessed the body. In most individuals, these difficulties are resolved without treatment. However, if T. cruzi is not completely cleared, the infection enters an indeterminate stage that can prevail for decades. The patient remains asymptomatic because the infection is kept under control by effective antiparasite cell-mediated and humoral Th1 immune responses. About one-third of Chagas\u2019 disease patients go on to the chronic stage of the disease, in which much more serious symptoms appear 10\u201340 years after the initial infection.

Humans naturally resistant to Schistosoma mansonii exhibit high levels of Th2 cytokines, whereas those susceptible to this pathogen have high levels of Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, susceptibility to S. mansonii infection in humans has been found to be under the control of a gene called SM1. Interestingly, this gene occurs in a chromosomal region (5q31-33) that encodes several molecules that regulate T cell differentiation.

Activated CD4+ T cells are critical for anti-helminth defense because these cells differentiate into effectors supplying the Th2 cytokines and CD40L contacts required for isotype switching to IgE by B cells. Circulating IgE directed against worm surface molecules can bind to the pathogen, attracting the attention of circulating eosinophils expressing Fc\u03b5RI molecules at a moderate density. Alternatively, prior to encountering specific antigen, the anti-parasite IgE may bind to mast cells expressing high levels of Fc\u03b5RI, allowing these cells to \u201cpre-arm\u201d against the parasite. In either case, the interaction of parasite antigen, anti-parasite IgE, and Fc\u03b5RI triggers intracellular signaling within eosinophils and mast cells that induces degranulation in close proximity to the worm. Eosinophil granules contain a variety of chemical substances that work directly and indirectly to kill the worm. Some molecules degrade the skin of the worm, creating an opening that allows other eosinophils to penetrate into its underlying tissues. These cells also degranulate and release additional toxic proteins and peptides that kill the worm. In addition, certain enzymes released from the eosinophil granule can further stimulate the release of histamine by activated mast cells. Histamine causes the contraction of host intestinal and bronchial smooth muscles that is associated with peristalsis and bronchospasm. The actions of these muscles can shake the parasite loose from its grip on the mucosae and expel it from the body. Histamine is also directly toxic to some helminth parasites.",

IL-5 strongly promotes the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of eosinophils, and supports the differentiation of plasma cells that have undergone isotype switching to IgA production. As we learned in Chapter 20, IgA is the precursor to secretory IgA that coats the mucosae and fends off parasite attachment, particularly that of schistosome worms. In humans, IL-5 expression is strongly associated with resistance to S. mansonii infection. IL-4 and IL-13 suppress macrophage production of IL-12, inhibiting IFN\u03b3 production and hence the development of a Th1 response. IL-13 is also required for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and the alterations to gastrointestinal fluids and the functions of intestinal smooth muscle and epithelial cells that accompany GI pathogen expulsion. Both IL-4 and IL-13 are effective in inducing Th2 responses to nematode and schistosome infections, but the response to a specific parasite may rely more heavily on one cytokine than the other. For example, IL-13 is more important than IL-4 for the expulsion of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis from the gut of mice, but either will do for the elimination of Trichurus muris.\n",

In addition, Plasmodium-infected RBCs express a parasite-encoded adhesion protein that allows the RBCs to bind to integrins on the surfaces of DCs and macrophages. This binding blocks the activation of macrophages and interferes with the maturation of DCs, thus inhibiting APC function and T cell responses. The erythrocytic stage of malaria infection can also induce the accelerated apoptosis of antigen-specific memory T cells. L. major uses slightly different tactics to manipulate the host immune response. The reader will recall from our previous discussion of viral evasion strategies that the cross-linking of CD46, complement receptors, or Fc\u03b3Rs on macrophages by viral components inhibits IL-12 production at the transcriptional level. Similarly, molecules expressed by L. major promastigotes and amastigotes can bind to macrophage CR3 and Fc\u03b3Rs, respectively, and reduce IL-12 production. The Th1 response that would kill the parasite is thus inhibited. Lastly, some parasites secrete hormone-like peptides that appear to downregulate the host immune response.",

Important fungal pathogens are Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida species, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis carinii (Table 22-13\n). Blastomycosis occurs when conidia of the yeast-like fungus B. dermatitidis are inhaled. This organism replicates extracellularly to cause a pulmonary infection that spreads through the blood to the skin, bones, and male urogenital tract, but not the gut. In contrast, H. capsulatum is an intracellularly replicating yeast-like fungus that causes histoplasmosis. Inhaled microconidia develop into Histoplasma that take up residence preferentially in local respiratory macrophages. A progressive pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis can spread to the secondary lymphoid organs, mucosae, gut, and adrenal glands. Candida species such as C. albicans and C. tropicalis lurk in the normal flora at the mucosae (but not in the skin) and cause disease only if these mucosal barriers are compromised. A deficiency of neutrophils in the host (neutropenia) leaves him or her especially vulnerable to candidiasis. Such Candida infections are usually fairly superficial in nature (such as vaginitis and cystitis) but can progress to infections of the eye, skin, and brain. Inhalation of spores of Aspergillus species causes a variety of diseases and can induce allergic responses. Conidia of three species, A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. niger, are particularly pathogenic for humans, causing invasive pulmonary infections that can be fatal if allowed to entrench. Again, neutropenia is an aggravating factor. Clumps of filamentous Aspergillus readily colonize previously damaged airway tissues. Aspergillus species also produce mycotoxins that damage hepatocytes, macrophages, and CTLs. C. neoformans is a yeast-like fungus often present in pigeon droppings. When the unencapsulated spores of Cryptococcus are inhaled by a host, the parasite enters the lung and synthesizes a protective capsule that inhibits phagocytosis. If the infection becomes established, the result may be cryptococcosis, a syndrome of pulmonary infection accompanied by meningitis. P. carinii is a unicellular eukaryote that, although classified as a fungus, shares structural features with the protozoan parasites. P. carinii infection causes PCP (P.carinii pneumonia), a common feature in immunocompromised individuals (especially AIDS patients). Inhalation of P. carinii results in severe lung damage in hosts lacking cell-mediated immune responses. Spread of the infection to other tissues does not usually occur.",

Over the years, it was found that each of these diseases could be transmitted to experimental animals by injecting brain extracts from patients or animals that had died of SE. Indeed, D. Carleton Gajdusek was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1976 for his discovery in the early 1960s that kuru in humans represented a new form of infectious disease.

Analysis of the scrapie agent revealed it to be extremely resistant to heat, formalin, and both UV- and ionizing irradiation\u2014all treatments that normally destroy infectious pathogens. Furthermore, scrapie, kuru, and vCJD did not provoke any of the normal immune responses expected during an infection.

Surprisingly, protocols that destroyed nucleic acids had no effect on scrapie infectivity, while procedures known to destroy proteins reduced its infectious strength. By 1982, Prusiner concluded that the agent responsible for scrapie infectivity was a protein devoid of any nucleic acid, an unprecedented discovery in biology. At this point, he coined the term \u201cprion\u201d to identify this novel type of pathogen that was both proteinaceous and infectious. The scrapie agent was therefore denoted as PrPsc (prion protein, scrapie). Further work by Prusiner established that PrPsc was actually a conformational isomer of a normal glycoprotein found on the surfaces of many mammalian cells. This normal glycoprotein was denoted PrPc (prion protein, cellular). It turns out that, upon exposure to a PrPsc molecule, a PrPc molecule undergoes a dramatic change in conformation. An \u03b1-helical region of the native PrPc protein spontaneously re-folds into the \u03b2-pleated sheet structure characteristic of PrPsc. This refolding process appears to be facilitated by an as-yet-unidentified co-factor (perhaps a membrane lipid). It is also unclear exactly where the conversion occurs, although there is some evidence pointing to the minute infoldings of the plasma membrane generated during pinocytosis (called caveolae) as the site. In any case, when PrPsc is introduced into a fresh host, it acts as a template for the refolding of existing host PrPc molecules into additional copies of PrPsc. In other words, the disease-causing prion can effectively \u201creplicate\u201d itself in a new host and a mass conversion of the host's PrPc molecules to the PrPsc conformation occurs (Fig. 22-15\n). Unlike PrPc, the misfolded PrPsc has profoundly altered physicochemical properties. When the PrPsc protein invades cells of the CNS, it induces brain degeneration that is manifested as the clinical signs of SE. Intriguingly, no other part of the body appears to be affected by the presence of PrPsc. For his discovery of prions and his investigations into the mechanisms by which they cause disease, Dr. Prusiner was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997.",

Interestingly, it appears that misfolding of native proteins may be implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Other forms of prion disease are inherited rather than infectious and do involve a mutation of the host's PrPc gene. More than 20 such mutations have been identified, some of which may account for the sporadic cases of prion disease that have been reported over the years. Once a mutated PrPc gene arises de novo in one individual, the pathogenic gene is passed down to his or her offspring.",

A small number of humans who consumed beef processed from these cattle then acquired the PrPsc protein and became ill with vCJD. The use of sheep offal as animal feed is now banned, but 1 million cattle were thought to have been infected with prions before this restriction came into place. Infectious prions are also responsible for the human disease kuru. Kuru was found almost exclusively among the Fore people of New Guinea, a tribe that used to routinely engage in ritualistic cannibalism. This practice included eating the brain tissue of dead relatives, some of whom had died of kuru. At the urging of missionaries, the practice of cannibalism ended in the late 1950s, so that the incidence of kuru has declined steadily since that time.",

Similarly, chickens immunized with either human or bovine PrPc coupled to the carrier KLH generate antibodies directed against human or bovine PrPc.

However, it appears that the immune system may actually promote the progress of prion disease both directly and indirectly. In a natural setting, prion infection occurs by a peripheral route, usually oral. Leukocytes are among the first cells to take up the prions, but the \u201creplication\u201d of the prions via PrPc conversion causes no harm to these cells, in contrast to the severe damage done to neurons. However, leukocytes are apparently responsible for the subsequent introduction of prions into the CNS. In addition, it seems that the FDC in the lymphoid follicles is required for the replication of prions that precedes their spread into the nervous system. The mechanism remains obscure but is an absolute requirement for prion disease progression. There is also evidence that the activation of specific complement components plays a role in the initial trapping of prions in the lymphoid organs soon after infection. This too may relate to FDC function, since C3d/C4b-opsonized antigens interact with CR2/CR1 complement receptors on FDC and may therefore be important for the intracellular accumulation of prions in the FDC. Other studies have suggested that macrophages and DCs can be involved in prion disease, and that a microbial or viral pathogen may sometimes act as a triggering co-factor.",

For example, while mitogenic stimulation of lymphoid cells enhanced prion disease susceptibility, lymphoid suppression achieved by either corticosteroid administration or splenectomy reduced it. In addition, studies of mice assessed at various time points after birth showed that increasing susceptibility to prion infection correlated with the progressive maturation of the immune system. Lastly, and perhaps most strikingly, scid mice (which cannot mount either T or B cell-mediated responses) were resistant to infection by the BSE or scrapie agents, while immunologically reconstituted scid mice were not.

            "text": "\nSUMMARYImmune responses have evolved to combat the five major types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. For all types of pathogens, the mechanisms of innate immunity offer an immediate response that either foils the establishment of infection or slows the infection down until adaptive immune mechanisms can target the pathogen more effectively. When an adaptive immune response is activated, the elements that will be most effective depend on whether the pathogen is extracellular or intracellular. Extracellular entities that are relatively small, such as extracellular bacteria, virus particles, protozoan parasites, and some fungi, can be targeted by antibody and then cleared effectively by antibody-and complement-mediated mechanisms that involve either direct lysis or phagocytic destruction. Protozoan worms are also subject to antibody assault because they are extracellular; however, these organisms are too large to be subsequently engulfed.Instead, specialized antibody isotypes such as IgA and IgE are produced to ensure that the worm does not become anchored in the host. In addition, mediators released by degranulating mast cells and eosinophils act on worm tissues to degrade them. Intracellular bacteria and replicating viruses, which are found inside host cells and cannot be targeted by antibody, must be eliminated by cytolytic mechanisms mediated by CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. A successful immune response against a given pathogen thus depends on cells and cytokines of the innate response inducing Th responses of the appropriate subtype, with Th1 responses being required for cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, and Th2 responses being needed for humoral responses against external threats. In the quest for continued survival, many pathogens have evolved complex evasion strategies intended to compromise the success of the immune response invoked.\n",

For example, human CMV induces both expression of the MHC class I analogue UL18 that can bind the IR, and the expression of UL40 that induces upregulation of HLA-E. In contrast, West Nile virus (WNV) induces overexpression of conventional MHC class I.",
