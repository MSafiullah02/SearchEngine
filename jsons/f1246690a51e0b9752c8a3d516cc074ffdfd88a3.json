As to March 10, 2020, a total of 80924 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in China, and 32778 confirmed cases overseas, which represents a trend of global spread(4). On 11 March 2020, the world health organization declared the COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Theoretically, the most effective strategy for epidemic is early diagnosis, quarantine and treatment. Therefore, how to diagnose COVID-19 early is of great importance. It's now the period of seasonal influenza, and the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to common respiratory diseases (influenza, common cold, viral pneumonia, etc.), which indicates the differential diagnosis are difficult for clinicians. At present, the diagnostic gold standard for studies had described the differences in clinical characteristics between ICU and non-ICU patients (7) (8) (9) (10) , however very few scientists focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups(11). Therefore, we described and compared the epidemiological history, clinical, laboratory characteristics and imaging features between confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 groups aim to providing a reference for the COVID-19 differential diagnosis, prevention and treatment.",

These nonspecific symptoms are shared by winter respiratory diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, especially influenza. Influenza are usually characterized by fever, myalgia, headache and dry cough, most of which are self-limiting but may also progress to severe conditions, such as pneumonia, myocarditis and death(16, 17). In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) also caused similar clinical symptoms, but more frequent diarrhea symptoms (18, 19) .

Qin et al demonstrated that lymphocytes counts in most severe COVID-19 patients was reduced, which suggests that SARS-CoV2 might impaired immune system and mainly damaged lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes (20) . This was similar to SARS-CoV, which spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, triggering a series of inflammatory responses and cytokine storm, resulting in changes in lymphocytes (21) . Therefore, the reduced white blood cell count and lymphocytes could be used as a reference index for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the ESR of the confirmed group was significantly higher than that of unconfirmed group, while there was no statistical difference in CRP and procalcitonin between the two groups. Therefore, ESR could help clinicians distinguish between COVID-19 and winter respiratory diseases.

In this study, 4 cases with asymptomatic infections of the 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients were first detected by chest CT scan and finally confirmed by RT-PCR. Therefore, it could not only be possible to identify patients with negative results of RT-PCR but highly suspicious of COVID-19 for clinicians, but also to screen patients with a clear history of epidemiological exposure but asymptomatic infection. In addition, chest CT was helpful for monitoring the dynamic therapeutic effect of patients during treatment(27). It was worth noting that 9 of the 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients in this study had no abnormal lesions in chest CT. Therefore, suspected cases with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory tests should be diagnosed combined with the results of RT-PCR test.",

Chest CT could become an effective clinical diagnostic tool for screening patients with suspected COVID-19, but the final diagnosis still needs to be combined with the results of RT-PCR tests.
