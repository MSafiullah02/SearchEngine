            "text": "During the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in studies pertaining to the interaction of various transition metal complexes with nucleic acid [1], [2], [3], due to their unique physical properties and potential applications in biology [4], [5]. In particular, the potential application of these complexes in the design and development of synthetic restriction enzymes, new drugs, DNA foot printing agents, stereoselective probes of nucleic acid structure has been explored extensively [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Polypyridyl metal complexes can bind to DNA in a non-covalent interaction fashion, such as electrostatic binding for cations, groove binding for large ligands [16], intercalative binding for planar ligands and partial intercalative binding for incompletely planar ligands [17], [18]. However, this activity has primarily focused on the mononuclear complexes, the di- or polynuclear complexes have attracted limited attention. Heterodinuclear metal complexes have some advantages over other complexes as photoprobes and stereochemical probes of nucleic acids, such as increased variations in shape and size, by connecting two chiral centers into a heterodinuclear complex one could hope to amplify the chiral discrimination. More recently, non-intercalating dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes have been synthesized as probes for DNA structure [13], [14], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].",

They were also used as shape-selective probes of RNA tertiary structure [31], agents of RNA oxidation cleavage [32] and recognition of mismatches in RNA [33]. However, investigations of the binding mode and the enantioselectivity for the interaction between metal complexes and RNA have been relatively few.

Although some experimental investigations on RNA\u2013metal complex interactions have been carried out during the past decade as described above, there are still some questions need to be answered for a better understanding of the mechanism and the biological implications of the interactions, for example, how the structures of nucleic acids affect the binding behaviors of metal complexes with them.

Also, the antitumor activities of the complex have been evaluated by MTT method (MTT = (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) and Giemsa staining experiment. We hope the results to be of value in understanding the mechanism of the interactions of metal complexes with nucleic acids, and should be useful in the development of nucleic acid molecular probes and new therapeutic regents for some diseases related to viruses such as AIDS (AIDS = acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and SARS (SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome).",

The ligand bpibH2 was prepared through condensation of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (2) with benzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde according to literature methods [40]. By the action of an ethylene glycol solution of bridging ligand bpibH2 (3) and the precursor complex cis-[Ru(phen)2Cl2] was converted into 4 under Ar atmosphere, then, by the action of an ethylene glycol solution of 4 and the precursor complex cis-[Co(phen)2Cl2]Cl was converted into the title complex under Ar atmosphere (51% yield). The desired Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex was isolated as its perchlorates and purified by column chromatography. The title complex was characterized by elemental analyses, mass spectra and NMR spectra. The heterodinuclear Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex displayed resolvable 1H NMR spectra in d6-DMSO, all proton resonance signals are assigned through 1H\u20131H COSY (COSY = correlated spectroscopy) experiments and the 1H NMR spectra of the heterodinuclear complexes. The well-defined 1H NMR spectra of the heterodinuclear Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex is given in Fig. 1\n, which permit unambiguous identification and assessment of purity. Due to the shielding influences of the adjacent the bridging ligand bpibH2 and phen, the phen protons of complexes exhibit two distinct sets of signals. In addition, the proton resonance on the nitrogen atom of the bridging ligand bpibH2 imidazole ring was not observed, because the proton is active and exchanges quickly between the two nitrogens of the imidazole ring. A similar example has been reported previously [43], [44]. The absorption spectrum of the heterodinuclear complex was recorded in acetonitrile solvent at room temperature (Fig. 2\n), which showed well resolved bands in the 200\u2013600 nm range. The lowest energy absorption bands at 459 nm for heterodinuclear complex are assigned to the metal\u2013ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition. The high energy absorption bands are attributed to the intragand \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition by comparison with the spectra of the bridging ligand [45].",

As can be seen from Fig. 3, with the increase of the concentration of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA, the UV\u2013vis spectra of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex showed clearly hypochromism and red shift in absorbance bands. For CT-DNA binding of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex, the hypochromism reaches as high as 57.3%, 35.2% and 24.9%, and red shifts of 3 nm, 10 nm and 9 nm at a ratio of [DNA]/[Ru\u2013Co] of 2.9 at 263 nm, 377 nm and 459 nm respectively. For yeast tRNA binding of the complex, upon increasing yeast tRNA concentration, the hypochromism reached as high as 54.4% , 29.1% and 23.1% at 263 nm, 377 nm and 459 nm, respectively, with 4-nm, 8-nm and 10-nm red shifts at a molar ratio of [RNA]/[Ru\u2013Co] of 1.9 at 263 nm, 377 nm and 459 nm respectively. Obviously, these spectral characteristics suggested that the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex could strongly interact with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, and the hypochromism of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA is higher than that of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with yeast tRNA. Compared the hypochromism of the UV\u2013visible spectra for both CT-DNA and yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex with that of CT-DNA binding of its parent complex [Ru(phen)3]2+ (hypochromism in MLCT (MLCT = metal-to-ligand charge transfer) band at 445 nm is 12% and the red shift is 2 nm) [47], which interacts with CT-DNA through a semiintercalation or quasi-intercalation [48], and considering that the UV\u2013vis spectrum of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine), a typical electrostatic binding complex, has been demonstrated to be unchanged upon the addition of CT-DNA [49], these spectral characteristics obviously suggest that both CT-DNA and yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex used in this paper are most likely through a mode that involved a stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore bpibH2 and the base pairs of CT-DNA and yeast tRNA.",

            "text": "In order to further elucidate quantitatively the affinity of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding to CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the intrinsic binding constants K\nb were obtained by monitoring the changes in absorbance at the three bands (263 nm, 377 nm and 459 nm respectively) with increasing concentration of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA using the following equation [50]:(1a)\u03b5a\u2212\u03b5f/\u03b5b\u2212\u03b5f=(b\u2212(b2\u22122Kb2CtNucleic acid/s)1/2/(2KbCt)\n(1b)b=1+KbCt+KbNucleic acid/2swhere [Nucleic acid] is the concentration of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA in base pairs, the apparent absorption coefficients \u03b5\na, \u03b5\nf, and \u03b5\nb correspond to A\nobsd/[Ru], the absorbance for the free Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex, and the absorbance for the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex in the fully bound form, respectively. K\nb is the equilibrium binding constant in M\u22121, C\nt is the total metal complex concentration, and s is the binding size. The K\nb values of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA are listed in Table 1\n. From Table 1, we can see that although Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex yielded hypochromism in the all bands induced by CT-DNA are bigger than that induced by yeast tRNA. Based on that the extent of the hypochromism commonly parallels the intercalative binding strength, the DNA-binding affinity of complex should be greater than that of yeast tRNA affinity, however, the K\nb values of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA are smaller than that of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with yeast tRNA. Some similar examples of complexes binding with DNA have been reported previously [51], [52], [53], [54]. Synthetically considering these reported results, we can further understand that the extent of the hypochromism commonly (but not absolutely) parallels the intercalative binding strength. Therefore, the K\nb values of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with CT-DNA and yeast tRNA presented in this article are not conflict with hypochromism. The values are comparable to that of those so-called DNA-intercalative Ru(II) complexes [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ (dppz = dipyrido-[3,2-a:2\u2032,3\u2032-c]phenazine, > 106\n M\u22121) [55], [Ru(bpy)2(dppx)]2+ (dppx = 7,8-dimethyldipyridophenazine, 8.8 \u00d7 106\n M\u2212 1) [56], and the known DNA intercalator EB (EB = ethidium bromide, 1.4 \u00d7 106\n M\u22121) [57]. However, compared the DNA binding affinities of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III)complex with those of [L2Ru{DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ}RuL2]4+ {where L = 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl, DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ = 11,11\u2032-bi(dipyrido-[3,2-a:2\u2032,3\u2032-c]-phenazinyl, K\n \u2248 l012\n M\u2212 1) [25] reported by Lincoln and Nord\u00e9n, the vast differences in the DNA binding affinities are observed. By the replacement of one Ru(II) for a Co(III) and one bridge DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ for a bridge bpibH2 in the complex [(phen)2Ru{DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ}Ru(phen)2]4+, the coordination number and the configuration of the new complex [(phen)2Ru(bpibH2)Co(phen)2]5+ still remain unchanged, which are the same as those of the complex [(phen)2Ru{DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ}Ru(phen)2]4+, however, which does result in the vast differences in the DNA binding affinities. This data indicates that replacement of one Ru(II) for a Co(III) and one bridge DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ for a bridge bpibH2 in the complex [(phen)2Ru{DPPZ(11-11\u2032)DPPZ}Ru(phen)2]4+ has a significant effect on the strength of DNA binding, and the most suitable metal ion and bridge ligand leads to the highest affinity of complexes with DNA. But, these are only preliminary and only qualitative results, further studies are underway in detail.",

Also, the characteristics of UV and visible spectra, as well as the binding constants obtained demonstrate that yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT-DNA binding. A possible explanation for this observation may be due to the A-form configuration and the L-shaped tertiary structure of yeast tRNA, in which the major groove, is wide and shallow, thus its base pairs are well exposed and can be attacked by complexes easily. In addition, the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex may bind to the bugle region of yeast tRNA, and that may be another reason why RNA binding affinity of the complex is greater.",

            "text": "Luminescene spectroscopy is one of the most common and at the same time most sensitive ways to analyze drug-nucleic acid interactions. Support for the above intercalative binding mode also comes from the emission measurement of complex. Upon excitation using a wavelength of 459 nm, the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex is luminescent in Tris buffer at room temperature, with the fluorescence maximum at 604 nm. As shown in the steady-state luminescene spectra of 1 \u03bcM solution of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex in the presence of CT-DNA or yeast tRNA (Fig. 4\n). Upon addition of CT-DNA (Fig. 4a), the fluorescence-emission intensity increases by a factor of ca. 1.74 and saturates at a [DNA]/[Ru\u2013Co] ratio of 2.4. This indicates that the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex strongly interacts with DNA, which efficiently \u2018protects\u2019 it, since the hydrophobic environment inside the DNA helix reduces the accessibility of solvent H2O to the complex, and because complex mobility is restricted at the binding site this results in a decrease of the vibrational modes of relaxation and thus higher emission intensity. In contrast, for yeast tRNA binding of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex, the fluorescence intensity of the complex decreased gradually upon the addition of yeast tRNA (Fig. 4b)\uff0cwhich suggested that yeast tRNA can partially quench the fluorescence of Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex. This quenching of fluorescence of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex by yeast tRNA is most probably due to electron or energy transfer between the Ru(II) complex and yeast tRNA caused by a stronger interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA [60]. The hypochromism of the peak reached as high as 64.8% and saturates at a [DNA]/[Ru\u2013Co] ratio of 3.0. Compared with that for CT-DNA, the change in emission for yeast tRNA titration was smaller. In addition, the inset of Fig. 4b shows a Stern\u2013Volmer plot of the quenching of fluorescence of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex by yeast tRNA, where I\n0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of yeast tRNA. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4b, at higher yeast tRNA concentrations, the quenching curve bended downward obviously and went up slowly, reaching a comparatively saturated situation at the molar ratio of yeast tRNA to the complex of about 3.0.",

We decided to perform some experiments at ambient temperature, using a similar method as that described by Satyanarayana et al. [61]. As illustrated in (Fig. 5\n), in the absence of CT-DNA (Fig. 5, top, dotted lines) or yeast Trna (Fig. 5, bottom, dotted lines), Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) was efficiently quenched by [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212, resulting in a linear Stern\u2013Volmer plot, and the slope, namely K\nsv is 9.68. However, in the presence of CT-DNA (Fig. 5, top, solid lines) or yeast tRNA (Fig. 5, bottom, solid lines), it is difficult to be quenched, which may be explained by the fact that the bound cations of Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) is protected from the anionic water-bound quencher by the array of negative charges along the DNA and RNA phosphate backbone [41]. Fig. 5 indicated that the fluorescence quenching curves were in good agreement with the linear Stern\u2013Volmer equation. For CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the slopes, namely K\nsv are 0.40 and 0.08. In the presence of CT-DNA and yeast tRNA, the final fluorescence intensity was originally 71.1% and 81.8%. The curvature reflects different degrees of protection or relative accessibility of bound cations, a large slope for the Stern\u2013Volmer curve parallels poorer protection and low binding. The result thus further confirms that Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) binds to yeast tRNA more strongly than to CT-DNA.",

            "text": "To further clarify the interactions between the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex and DNA, viscosity measurements were carried out on CT-DNA by varying the concentration of the added complex. Hydrodynamic measurements that are sensitive to length change (i.e., viscosity and sedimentation) are regarded as the least ambiguous and the most critical tests of a binding model in solution in the absence of crystallographic structural data [33]. A classical intercalation model demands that the DNA helix must lengthen as base airs are separated to accommodate the binding ligand, leading to the increase of DNA viscosity. In contrast, a partial or non-classical intercalation ligand could bend (or kink) the DNA helix, reduce its effective length and, concomitantly, its viscosity [62]. The effects of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex together with ethidium bromide (EB) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ on the viscosity of rod-like DNA are shown in Fig. 6\n. EB has been well known to binding with DNA through the intercalation mode. While for complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+, which has been known to bind with DNA in electrostatic mode, it exerts essentially no effect on DNA viscosity. On increasing the amounts of Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex, the relative viscosity of DNA increases steadily, which is similar to the behavior of EB. The increased degree of viscosity, which may depend on its affinity to DNA follow the order of EB > Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) > [Ru(bpy)3]2+. A similar sharp increase in relative viscosity has been observed on the addition [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+, which was proved to be bound to DNA by intercalation. The results suggest that the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binds to DNA through a classical intercalation model. Such a result is consistent with the foregoing hypothesis.",

Racemic solutions of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex dialyzed against CT-DNA or yeast tRNA for 32 h, and then subjected to CD analysis. During the course of the dialysis at intervals of time, the CD signals started from none, increased to the maximum magnitude after 32 h dialysis of the complex, then no longer changed. That is to say, the CD signals of the complex neither increased nor decreased at the end. The CD spectra in the region of 230\u2013630 nm for complex the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex after its racemic solution had been dialyzed against CT-DNA and yeast tRNA are shown in Fig. 7\n. As shown in Fig. 7, the dialysates of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex dialyzed against CT-DNA and yeast tRNA showed two distinct sets of CD signals, with two positive peaks at about 280 nm and 420 nm, two negative peaks at about 300 nm and 470 nm, and the CD signals for the dialysate of the complex dialyzed against yeast tRNA were much stronger than those for the complex dialyzed against CT-DNA. The presence of CD signals indicates enrichment of the enantiomer binding less favorably to yeast tRNA or CT-DNA. Although the complex was not resolved into the pure enantiomers, and we cannot determine which enantiomer binds preferentially yeast tRNA or CT-DNA, it is evident that the complex interact enantioselectivly with both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT-DNA. According to the proposed binding model by Barton and co-workers [11], the \u0394 enantiomer of the complex, a right-handed propeller-like structure, displays a greater affinity than the \u039b enantiomer with the left-handed CT-DNA helix due to more-appropriate steric matching. Although the configuration of CT-DNA is different from that of yeast tRNA, both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA have the same right-handed helix structure. Therefore, we can deduce that the \u0394 enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT-DNA than the \u039b enantiomer does. In addition, the phenomenon that the CD signals for the dialysate of the complex dialyzed against yeast tRNA are much stronger than those for the complex dialyzed against CT-DNA, which implies that the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex binding with yeast tRNA shows more enantioselective than that with CT-DNA. Therefore, for yeast tRNA, the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex is a better enantioselective binder.",

Cis-platin has been included as the control, and it shows high cytotoxicity, which are in accordance with the literature reports [64]. The IC50 values were calculated after 48 h of incubation with complexes and are listed in Table 2\n. As shown in Table 2, the Ru\u2013Co complex demonstrated different cytotoxicity against selected tumor cell lines in vitro, namely, the human HL-60 cells are more sensitive to the Ru\u2013Co complex than HepG2 cells. Compared the Ru\u2013Co complex with cis-platin, the former displayed lower antitumor activity against the tumor cells tested. The results indicated that the toxicity of the Ru\u2013Co complex was found to be concentration dependent, namely, the cell viability decreased with increasing complex concentration. Although higher complex concentration reduced the percentages of cell survival, there is a significant difference in susceptibility between the Ru\u2013Co complex and cis-platin. It's well known that, due to exist leaving group (chloride ion) in cis-platin, its cytotoxic effects through covalent binding to DNA form cis-DDP-DNA adducts, which interferes with DNA replication and transcription and ultimately induces cell death. However, no leaving group exists in the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex, therefore, the anti-tumor mechanism of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex may not occur with the DNA cross-linking reaction. Furthermore, the anti-tumor mechanism of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex does not seem entirely like that of some organic molecules, such as drugs adriamycin and daunorubicin, which inhibit tumor by inserting DNA. According to the results, we speculate that the antitumor activity of the Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex not only may be related to inserting DNA, but also related to the specific molecular shape of Ru(II)\u2013Co(III) complex and the chemical structure and nature of the inserted ligand.",
