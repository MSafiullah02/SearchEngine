            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a highly virulent emerging infectious disease, can spread rapidly among large human populations as demonstrated in the first half of 2003. The etiological agent of SARS was identified as a new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). While the first SARS epidemic was successfully contained with the collaborative efforts organized by the World Health Organization, SARS remains a potential threat due to the mysterious source of its initial infection and highly transmittable nature of this virus (Callow et al., 1990, Holmes, 2001, Kraaijeveld et al., 1980). Its apparent presence in animal reservoirs provided the possibility of reemergence, including in forms with increased infectivity. Because the symptoms of SARS can be confused clinically with many respiratory diseases caused by other etiological agents, a simple and highly specific diagnostic test applicable at the early onset of SARS still needs to be developed. The current medical strategies mainly relying on non-specific anti-viral and supportive treatment are not sufficient. While questions remain whether natural SARS infection will ever return in the form seen in 2003, it is important to test various candidate SARS-CoV vaccines and to produce tools which can be used to diagnose and treat this infection when it re-emerges.",

Open reading frames (ORFs) analysis by analogy with other known coronaviruses indicated that four structural proteins might play important functions associated with SARS-CoV infection, including the surface spike protein S (1,255 aa), which has an N-terminal receptor binding domain to mediate attachment to cellular receptors (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002, Wong et al., 2004) and C-terminal heptad repeats (HRs) to promote virus entry by fusion with cell membranes (Bosch et al., 2003, Luo and Weiss, 1998, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Spiga et al., 2003). The nucleocapsid N protein (422 aa) is a highly basic structural protein, which is usually known to bind viral RNA to form the helical core structure in coronavirus (Davies et al., 1981) and to promote viral packaging and viral core formation (He et al., 2004a, Hiscox et al., 2001). The matrix membrane glycoprotein M (221 aa) is an integral membrane protein involved in budding. There is a small envelope protein E (76 aa), a critical component of the virus responsible for virion envelope morphogenesis (Arbely et al., 2004) which acts as a scaffold protein to trigger assembly. SARS-CoV lacks the envelope-associated hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein that is encoded by some coronaviruses. There are additional genome fragments which code for RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (1a/b) and eight other non-structure proteins (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003).",

However, the breadth and specificity of antibody responses in animals immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV have not been well characterized. At the same time, a number of studies have mapped the major neutralizing domain on SARS-CoV to the S protein between amino acids 261 and 672 (Sui et al., 2004). This epitope coincides with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding site identified for S protein in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV (Berry et al., 2004, Che et al., 2003, He et al., 2003, Hua et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Sui et al., 2004, ter Meulen et al., 2004, Traggiai et al., 2004, Wen et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004).",

Our results suggested that most mAbs generated by this approach recognized quite diverse epitopes on S protein but not against the other three structural proteins (N, E, and M). S-specific mAbs showed different biological activities. Because virion-associated antigens may resemble the true topology of SARS-CoV antigens more closely than recombinant SARS-CoV proteins, the current study produced a panel of mAbs against epitopes which may not be otherwise recognized, thus providing useful tools for a wide range of potential applications related to SARS research.",

We used individual segments of S (Fig. 2\n) to further map the epitopes for six mAbs that showed high reactivity against the full-length S protein. The designation of S1 (aa 12\u2013798) and S2 (aa 797\u20131255) domains in the current study was based on the knowledge of S protein structure from coronaviruses in general (Lai and Holmes, 2001) and the alignment of SARS-CoV S protein sequence against S proteins from other coronaviruses with known cleavage sites between their S1 and S2 domains (Bosch et al., 2003, Krokhin et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Spiga et al., 2003). However, there has been no direct evidence in the literature to suggest S protein of SARS-CoV was cleaved into S1 and S2. In our study, the S1 segment was further divided into two sub-segments, S1.1 (aa 12\u2013535) and S1.2 (aa 534\u2013798), based on the distribution of the predicted N-glycan sites. The S1.1 segment was then further divided into S1.1a (aa 12\u2013311) and S1.1b (aa 310\u2013535), and the latter was reported to be the site for binding of SARS-CoV S protein to its receptor ACE 2 (Li et al., 2003).",

The specificity of these mAbs was further confirmed by Western blot analysis recognizing specific recombinant S protein fragments. Fig. 3\nshows the example of one mAb, 2A3, whose specificity was mapped to the S1.1a domain by ELISA (Fig. 3A) and confirmed by the Western blot of its recognition to recombinant S, S1, S1.1 proteins, and the SARS-CoV virion associated S antigen, but not to recombinant S1.2 or S2 protein (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the epitopes of mAbs 2B1 and 2C5 were mapped to S1.1a and S1.1b, respectively (Table 1). Another mAb, 3A3, which mapped to the S2 domain by ELISA (Table 1), recognized not only the virus-associated full-length S antigen and its oligomer but also a smaller fragment about 70 kDa which is likely to be the cleaved S2 (Fig. 4\n). Interestingly, the other two S-specific mAbs (1B4 and 1A5) as identified by the ELISA screening did not show any recognitions to the recombinant S proteins by the Western blot (Table 1), suggesting these mAbs may mainly recognize non-denatured epitopes.",

While it is less likely that inactivated SARS-CoV can completely reflect the antigen conformation of SARS-CoV, our data revealed that the S protein is the dominant antigen among the virion-associated proteins because majority of the mAbs produced in this study were specific for S protein including two with excellent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 6). It is interesting that none of the mAb could recognize N, M, and E antigens even though anti-N antibody has been reported as one of the major antibody components in SARS-CoV-infected patient sera (Ying et al., 2004). This finding is different from the recent in vitro study using subunit SARS-CoV antigens in which M protein interacts with the N protein through its C-terminal domain to facilitate formation of nucleocapsids, and M was also reported to be able to interact with S protein to form pseudoparticles (Huang et al., 2004). In the same study, DNA vaccine expressing N antigen elicited high titer anti-N antibody responses thus ruling out the possibility that N is a poor immunogen.",

Knowledge related to the specificity of antibody responses generated by inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines is important for the evaluation of efficacy and safety profile for such vaccination approach against SARS. Viral enhancing antibody (or autoimmune responses) was reported for inactivated vaccine approach against animal coronaviruses (Marshall and Enserink, 2004, Scott, 1987).

This is different from other approaches that produced anti-S mAbs. MAbs have been isolated from SARS-CoV-infected patients' IgG memory B lymphocytes and immortalized with EBV (Traggiai et al., 2004). Mice receiving the high dose of one such mAb, S3.1, were protected from viral challenge (Traggiai et al., 2004). Another study showed that a mAb specific for the nucleoprotein and five mAbs reacted with the Spike protein out of the seventeen IgG mAbs screened by ELISA were able to neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro (Berry et al., 2004). A human mAb CR3014, generated by antibody phage display technology screening a large naive antibody library, could reduce replication of SARS-CoV if prophylactic administrated to ferret (ter Meulen et al., 2004). Several mAbs were raised by using recombinant protein fragments of the SARS CoV S protein (residues 249\u2013667 or 485\u2013625) or N proteins expressed from Escherichia coli (Berry et al., 2004, Che et al., 2003, Wen et al., 2004). Synthetic gene fragments from predicted S epitopes have also been used to raise mAbs to study the S domain structure (Hua et al., 2004). There were recombinant antibodies against E and N protein isolated from the mouse synthetic VH + VL scFv phage display library with high binding affinity to the SARS proteins E and N purified from E. coli (Liu et al., 2004). Our study used the inactivated vaccine approach to immunize the mice and the resulting mAbs showed diverse specificities and various biological functions.",

Specificities and strength of two high titer neutralizing mAbs (1A5 and 2C5) were indistinguishable in our experiment, thus they probably recognized the same or a closely related epitope. The relative ease with which these mAbs were generated further supports the idea that subunit vaccination with S1- or S1.1b-like constructs may be sufficient to protect animals and perhaps humans. Two of the three S1.1a-specific mAbs (2A3 and 1B4) also showed slightly positive neutralizing activities. However, their low neutralizing titers would not support the role of S1.1a region as another neutralizing domain. These two mAbs may recognize a region on S protein which can interfere with the binding of virion to the viral receptor but may not be in a direct manner.",

It is quite unique that 2D4 could not recognize either the full-length recombinant S protein or the virion-associated full-length S protein. The direct interpretation of this finding is that the 2D4 epitope in the S1.1a region may not be accessible on the full-length S protein given the large size and heavy glycosylation of SARS-CoV S protein.

Most of the reports suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV was not normally processed into S1 and S2 subunits; however, it could be cleaved by exogenous trypsin (Simmons et al., 2004, Yao et al., 2004). In the current study, a cleaved S2 fragment at about 70 kDa was identified with S2-specific mAb 3A3 by Western blot analysis. This finding is consistent with the observation in a recent publication that an S2 product was detected by mAb generated by purified recombinant S2 protein (Wu et al., 2004). These data revealed important evidence that S protein can be cleaved in the lysate of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, indicating the presence of proteolytic processing of S protein. This process may be cell dependent because no such cleavage was observed with recombinant S protein in transfected 293T cells. The availability of specific cellular enzyme may be critical for such cleavage. The discovery of mAbs 2D4 (specific for processed S1 protein) and 3A3 (specific for S2) can aid further study on the proteocleavage of S protein.",

Therefore, in this study, the immunoglobulin isotypes were also analyzed although it is known that the classification of mouse IgG subclasses does not match with that of human's. Among 11 IgG mAbs produced from this study, there are five IgG1, five IgG2a, and one IgG2b. Two strong neutralizing mAbs 1A5 and 2C5 were IgG2a and IgG1, respectively.
