            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was first described in 1963 and was initially termed \u2018chronic fibrinois peritonitis\u2019.1 Today, FIP is a major killer of domestic cats, especially kittens\u2014where over 50% of FIP infections occur in cats younger than 12 months.2 FIP is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), which belongs to the alphacoronavirus phylogeny. FIP affects domesticated and wild cats globally and is especially prevalent in multi-cat households because it is spread through the feces. Studies have shown that at least 50% of American cats have antibodies against FCoV.3 Typically, FCoV infection results in feline enteric coronavirus (FEC), which is highly prevalent in cats and causes asymptomatic to mild enteritis and diarrhea.4, 5 FEC is known to replicate in enterocytes; however, spontaneous mutation of a particular region in the FCoV genome allows for the phagocytosis of the FCoV virions into macrophages and their subsequent replication.6, 7, 8 The ability of mutated FCoV to replicate in macrophages allows the coronavirus to spread throughout the entire cat, ultimately resulting in FIP virus (FIPV).9 Approximately 5% of cats in multi-cat households develop fatal FIPV.10 Currently, there are no therapeutics on the market for the treatment of this deadly feline virus. Non-domestic cats are also affected by FIP; cheetahs are known to be highly susceptible to the disease, having a possible predisposition as a consequence of a genetic deficiency in their cellular immunity.11\n",

Upon translation, ORF1a and ORF1b produce the coronaviral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.12, 13 The viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are then processed by two cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease (Mpro) or nsp5. Both PLpro and 3CLpro are essential for the coronaviral life cycle, making them appealing targets for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics.",

A trend is immediately observed in the six compounds with the highest inhibition of FIPV-3CLpro (6\u201311), that is, having greater than 60% inhibition at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM, where a leucine residue is favored in the P\n2 position of the inhibitor over phenyl or isopentenyl groups (1\u20133). Analysis of the eleven cleavage sites within the FIPV replicase polyprotein 1ab shows that nine of the eleven cleavage sites have a leucine residue at the P\n2 position and none have a phenylalanine residue (Fig.1\nA), which is the P\n2 residue that is present in compounds 1, 2 and 4, 5.21 Furthermore, the two best peptidomimetic inhibitors, compounds 6 and 7, have either a serine or threonine residue at the P\n4 position.

The statistics for X-ray data collection, processing, and refinement are given in the Supplementary material.22, 23, 24 The X-ray structure of the FIPV-3CLpro:6 complex was determined to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution (Rpim\n = 4.0%, Rwork\n = 17.6% Rfree\n = 23.0%) with four monomers in the asymmetric unit (Fig.2\nA and B). The four monomers in the asymmetric unit represent two complete, biologically active dimers of the FIPV-3CLpro:6 complex. Electron density associated with compound 6 is clearly visible in final, FO\n \u2212 \nFC electron density omit maps contoured to +3.0\u03c3 (Fig.2C).",

Interestingly, Kim and coworkers have shown that peptidomimetic compounds, similar to our compounds 1\u20133, with sterically bulky P\n2 substituents (leucine, benzyl or cyclohexylmethyl) are effective against FCoV in cell-based antiviral assays.18 This suggests that despite the reduced inhibition of FIPV-3CLpro by compounds 1\u20135 relative to 6\u201311, these compounds may be effective in cell-based antiviral assays. Kim et al. did not test their compounds against purified FIPV 3CLpro enzyme suggesting that our compounds 6\u201311 may be even more potent in FCoV antiviral assays. Furthermore, Kim et al. have demonstrated that peptidomimetics akin to 1\u20133 and 5\u201311 are capable of reducing viral titers and pathological lesions in the livers of mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus similar to FCoV.18 Together, our studies and those of Kim et al. suggest that peptidomimetic compounds like 1\u20133 and 6\u201311 may have significant potential for being developed into effective therapeutics against FIPV infection.",

We determined the X-ray structure of FIPV-3CLpro in complex with the best peptidomimetic inhibitor identified, compound 6, which is the first reported structure of FIPV-3CLpro. The molecular details elucidated from the X-ray structure of FIPV-3CLpro in complex with 6 provide insights into the key interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme that can be targeted in the design of more potent FIPV-3CLpro inhibitors.",
