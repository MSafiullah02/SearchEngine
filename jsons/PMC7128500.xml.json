Although annual influenza vaccine production is a well-planned process, rapid bulk manufacture of avian influenza vaccines of unknown growth and processing characteristics may be challenging. New approaches in immunisation strategies may be required to optimise protection of immunologically unprimed individuals.2\n",

Before release from high biocontainment, reassortant viruses derived by reverse genetics from highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses must undergo stringent safety testing.4 Currently it can take 8\u201312 weeks following receipt of wild-type virus to the release of a safe reference vaccine virus to manufacturers. In some countries, guidelines governing \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d impose additional regulation on work with viruses generated by reverse genetics. This time could be reduced substantially if regulatory authorities agree to allow release of these viruses earlier in the process. Because of intellectual property rights surrounding this technology, vaccine manufacturers may need to obtain appropriate licences in advance. To reduce delays in developing reference viruses, it is essential that avian influenza isolates from poultry and human beings are shared quickly with WHO laboratories for antigenic characterisation.",

The European approach is the development of \u201ccore dossiers\u201d that contain preclinical and safety data pertinent to existing influenza vaccines. Dossiers can be submitted in advance, and the strain or subtype variation added once the pandemic strain is known. Safety and immunogenicity assessments of adjuvanted or new formulations should be done during interpandemic periods.
