Nevertheless, vaccination still remains contentious owing to its limitations. For example, conventional inactivated virus vaccines may leave residual live virus in vaccines, DNA vaccines elicit inadequate neutralizing antibody to protect against the disease in swine (Balamurugan et al., 2004, Ward et al., 1997), chimeric vaccines have possibilities to lead to production of virulent viruses and to a lack of thermostability for inactivated vaccine production (Van Rensburg and Mason, 2002) and so on. Furthermore, it is imperative to use a new antiviral strategy to compensate vaccine\u2019s requirement of at least 7 days to induce protection while the clinical disease and infectivity appear in infected animals as early as 2\u20133 days post-exposure (Grubman and de los Santos, 2005).",

It is known that the viral genomic RNA in positive-stranded picornaviruses was used both as a messenger for translation and as a template for negative-strand synthesis and there might be a \u201cswitch\u201d between these processes (Belsham, 2005, van Rij and Andino, 2006). Recent studies of poliovirus (Gitlin et al., 2005) and influenza virus (Kahana et al., 2004) showed that intriguingly only the positive RNA strand was targeted by RNAi. As the cleavage at a specific location might result in degradation of the full length of virus, we chose VP1 of FMDV as a specific target to inhibit the replication of FMDV, which encodes a structural protein and contains an Arg\u2013Gly\u2013Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence in G-H loop responsible for binding of fibronectin to its cellular receptor integrins (Mason et al., 2003).",

In brief, sequence candidates from VP1 gene of FMDV for siRNAs synthesis were selected using the web-based tool siRNA Target Designer (Version 1.51) from Promega (http://www.promega.com/siRNADesigner/) which meets the sequence requirement that the presence of a \u201c5\u2032-GN17C-3\u2032\u201d sequence in the target RNA is needed. Specificity of the sequence candidates was verified by BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). The DNA templates for in vitro transcription of siRNAs contain T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and six extra nucleotides upstream of the minimal promoter sequence and an additional two adenine nucleotides are added to the 5\u2032 end of templates. The pEGFP-N1-siRNA (Qin et al., 2004) and scrambled-siRNA were also chosen as positive and negative siRNA control, respectively. The oligonucleotide-directed production of small interfering RNA with T7 RNA polymerase was carried out using T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Betz, 2003) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sense and antisense 21-nucleotide RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions, incubating at 70\u00b0 for 10 min, followed by 20 min at room temperature to obtain small interfering double-stranded RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. The mixture was then purified by isopropanol precipitation followed by 70% ethanol washing, dried and resuspended in appropriate amount of nuclease-free water. siRNA aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0 until used.",

Firstly, the high genetic and phenotypic variability of FMDV inevitably poses the need for screening a relatively large amount of siRNAs for those efficaciously inhibiting the amplification of FMDV in a specific FMD outbreak. Secondly, the chemical synthesis of siRNAs involves high cost, and the large quantities of shRNAs cloned into plasmid or viral vectors are time-consuming, both of which cannot guarantee the sufficient inhibitory effect.

First, the most important factor for virus escape from efficacious siRNAs in our experiments might be the quasispecies of FMDV, but not those new emerging resistant variants. As our results showed, the inhibitory effect of each efficacious siRNA did not persist longer than 48 h post-infection, which could not allow the occurrence of large number of mutants despite high mutation rates of FMDV. Second, the restricted transfection efficiency of siRNAs could not guarantee complete occupation of siRNAs in BHK-21 cells infected with FMDV.

In this study, quasispecies dynamics or possibly high mutation rates of FMDV RNA might facilitate the escape of FMDV from siRNA, which is characterized by a high degree of sequence specificity. As we observed, different variants existed in the supernatant of viral infected BHK-21 cells. Particularly, as we tested, a single nucleotide substitution G \u2192 A found within the VP1-siRNA401 target region can be the main factor causing the marked decrease of anti-FMDV efficacy. Moreover, although the single nucleotide substitution C \u2192 T near the target region of VP1-siRNA616 did not result in resistance of the target sequence to VP1-siRNA616, we cannot absolutely deny the possibility that the existence of variations within VP1-siRNA616 target sequence could be identified by molecular cloning and sequencing of more clones. It was also possible that the C \u2192 T substitution could affect the RNA structure, affecting the accessibility of RISC to FMDV RNA and the efficiency of interference. A study of HIV-1 escape mutant viruses (Westerhout et al., 2005) revealed that not only the nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target sequence, but also the mutations outside the target region stabilizing a repressive structure in viral RNA genome could mediate escape from RNAi. Variations within VP1, identified by us, were not located in the target sequence for VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519. Additionally, the restricted transfection efficiency and the relatively quick speed of degradation of siRNAs could not guarantee that siRNAs entered all the FMDV-infected BHK-21 cells or persisted long enough at an efficacious concentration, raising the possibility of virus escape.",

Fortunately, many strategies, such as the non-viral or viral vector-based expression of shRNA in vivo, and the selection of conserved sequences and the combinatorial use of several viral and/or feasible cellular targets, are being exploited to overcome the above problems (Brass et al., 2008, Giering et al., 2008).
