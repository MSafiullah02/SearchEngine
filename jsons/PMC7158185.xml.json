Although specific attention is focused on these tissues in inhalation studies, treatment-related effects sometimes occur in the nose following exposure to chemicals administered by other routes, such as gavage dosing. Because of the varied anatomic features of the nasal passages and the encasement of the nose within the bones of the maxilla, special attention to collection, fixation, trimming, and sectioning is required to obtain uniform sections. Optimal decalcification, rinsing, and processing are critical for obtaining well-stained sections of the nose for histopathological evaluation. Anatomical landmarks for trimming and careful embedding must be used to consistently obtain the desired sections. These landmarks are illustrated and described in Section 2. Typically, three or four levels of the nose, three levels of the larynx, and one section of the trachea are examined. This chapter provides a brief outline of the morphology of the nose, larynx, and trachea and descriptions of spontaneous and treatment related lesions observed in these tissues in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.\n",

Proliferation of the mesenchyme at the margins of the placode produces a depression (the nasal pit), which deepens to form the primary nasal cavity. The first microvilli on respiratory epithelium appear around day 14, and by day 18, cilia are evident. The olfactory epithelium develops from ectoderm of the olfactory placode in the roof of the nasal passages. Primitive neuroepithelial cells become neuroblasts and then esthesioneurocytes, which are thought to differentiate into sustentacular cells and olfactory neurons. By day 18 of gestation, the olfactory epithelium exhibits clear differentiation of sensory and sustentacular cells and resembles that in the adult rat.",

The nasal passages consist of two major compartments separated by a septum with three well-developed sets of turbinates, the nasoturbinates, maxilloturbinates, and ethmoid turbinates (Figure 22.1\n), that project into the lumen of each compartment (Harkema et al., 2006). The septal window in the caudoventral portion of the nasal cavity provides a direct connection between the left and right nasal passages and the nasopharyngeal duct. The septal window is the point of convergence for both air and mucus streams. There are four main routes for inspiratory airflow through the dorsal, middle, ventral, and lateral meatuses (Figure 22.1) (Morgan et al., 1989). Nasal airflow pattern is one of numerous factors influencing the distribution of nasal lesions in toxicology studies (Morgan and Monticello, 1990). The lateral meatus has a characteristic medially curved profile ventrally and a curved lateral recess dorsally, which reflect its anatomical association with the roots of the incisor teeth.",

Nasal lesions tend to be site specific due to airflow, regional deposition of inhaled toxicants and chemicals, and regional tissue sensitivity or susceptibility to these agents (Morgan and Monticello, 1990). In toxicologic studies, it is essential to sample and evaluate the nasal cavity in relation to the regional differences. Three sections are routinely examined microscopically in studies sponsored by the National Toxicology Program. However, modifications in the number of levels sectioned may be necessary, depending on the degree of detail needed for a particular study (Mery et al., 1994). Specific palatal landmarks are used to obtain the necessary sections (Figure 22.2\n). Level I is trimmed immediately posterior to the upper incisor teeth; Level II, through the level of the incisive papilla anterior to the first palatial ridge; Level III, through the middle of the second molar teeth. Using these landmarks, some variation will still be observed. A difference of millimeters at a particular level will alter the amount and shape of nasoturbinates and teeth, the location of ducts and accessory glands, and the types of epithelium in the section.\n",

The posterior septal glands, ventral to the junction between the respiratory epithelium and the septal olfactory organ, and near the bony encasement of the vomeronasal organ, have a mucous secretion that empties into the vomeronasal organ. The posterior septal glands can be clearly distinguished from the anterior septal glands by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of the posterior glands. The lamina propria of the turbinates and lateral wall also contains tubular and compound acinar glands whose ducts open directly into the maxillary sinus or nasal lumen.",

The sensory neurons are bipolar, and interposed between the sustentacular cells. The nuclei and perikaryon of the olfactory neurons are in the middle third of the epithelial layer. An apical dendritic process extends above the surface of each epithelial cell to form a bulbous swelling, the olfactory vesicle. The olfactory vesicle has 10\u201315 basal bodies that give rise to long, nonmotile, sensory cilia that are approximately 50 microns in length and 0.1\u20130.3 microns in diameter (Harkema et al., 2006, Jenkins et al., 2009, Menco, 1997, Naguro and Iwashita, 1992). These cilia intertwine with each other and with surface microvilli to provide an extensive surface area for reception of odorants. An axon originates from the base of each olfactory neuron and passes through the basal lamina to join axons from adjacent neuronal cells to form nonmyelinated nerve fascicles and bundles in the lamina propria. The axons from the olfactory nerves traverse perforations in the cribriform plate to synapse with neurons forming the outer olfactory nerve layer of the olfactory bulb.",

The M cells are similar to those of the gut- and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT and BALT). Most of the nasal secretions pass over this area on their way to the nasopharynx. NALT is considered to play a central role in regional mucosal immunity of the upper respiratory tract. M cells function in the uptake and translocation of antigen from the surface of the nasal epithelium to the submucosal lymphoid aggregates.

Conditioning of the air also prevents excessive drying of the mucosal surfaces and facilitates absorption of olfactory stimuli. Inspired air is cleansed by the absorption and/or metabolism of toxic and irritant gases and vapors and filtering of particulates of various sizes. The short coarse hairs of the external nares eliminate larger inhaled particulates whereas smaller particulates, toxic gaseous and chemical impurities are trapped in the seromucous layer that covers the mucosal surfaces and are effectively removed by the mucociliary apparatus.",

Mucus in the anteriodorsal portion of the nose of the rat flows as a counter-current system with respect to the inspired air. The counter-current exchange system maintains a concentration gradient between the two fluids in order to maximize movement from one fluid to the other. The complex mucus streams converge on the nasopharyngeal duct to pass into the pharynx and are subsequently swallowed along with any trapped materials. In addition to clearing particulate material from the upper respiratory tract, as the medium in which olfactory molecules are dissolved, mucus prevents excessive transudation of fluid from tissues into the lumen and inward osmotic passage of water condensed on the surface during expiration, and facilitates the sense of smell.",

There are specialized organs in the nasal cavity concerned with olfaction including the olfactory neuroepithelium, vomeronasal organ, septal olfactory organ, and olfactory nerves (fila olfactoria). The septal olfactory organ is a functioning part of the chemosensory system and primarily has an alerting function, providing information relevant to odor stimulus assessment. The vomeronasal organ may also play an important role in the sucking reflex in the young and reproduction in the adult through recognition of pheromones and affecting release of hormones from the pituitary. Unlike the respiratory epithelium, the olfactory epithelium has high levels of cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which are considered important in metabolism and removal of odorants. The high metabolic capacity of submucosal glands may contribute to the development of some chemically induced lesions in the olfactory epithelium. Submucosal glands of the maxillary sinus also have extensive metabolic capacity and are specific target cells for some chemicals that require metabolism to proximate carcinogens.",

The extrinsic laryngeal muscles position and stabilize the larynx. The intrinsic muscles regulate tension in the vocal folds, and open and close the entrance to the trachea.

Epithelial degeneration is less common in the submucosal glands. Degeneration may be accompanied by mucosal inflammation and variable exudation into the nasal passages. Degenerative lesions that result from exposure to chemicals of low toxicity or irritancy, or to low concentrations of more potent chemicals, may be subtle and difficult to detect. Such mild lesions may manifest only as loss of cilia and slight flattening or rounding of normally cuboidal/columnar cells. Some areas normally have few cilia, and nonciliated epithelial cells are normally present in the respiratory type epithelium, which may make lesions detection difficult. When the epithelium of the submucosal glands is affected, glandular dilation and accumulation of secretory material in the ducts may be observed. Atrophy of the respiratory epithelium may occur secondary to degeneration. The affected epithelium appears thin and may not be pseudostratified (Figure 22.18\n).

The significance of exposure-related exacerbation of this change in inhalation studies is uncertain, but is thought to be a nonspecific, adaptive or protective response to chronic inhalation exposure to chemical irritants and frequently accompanies epithelial hyperplasia. The globules are located in the sub- or supra-nuclear cytoplasm and are thought to be secretory in nature.

Following more severe injury, sustentacular cells may predominate or there may be complete loss of sensory and sustentacular cells, and the atrophic epithelium may be lined primarily by basal epithelial cells.

Exposure to highly irritant agents may elicit an early suppurative response, which may persist. With suppurative inflammation, there are considerably more neutrophils, many of which are degenerate. Cellular debris from damaged tissue and degenerate and dead neutrophils, fibrin and protein exudation may be evident. Chronic inflammation signifies a persistent response to injury. There may be a predominance of mononuclear inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes mostly), with fewer neutrophils, as the response to injury progresses. Evidence of tissue destruction may still be evident, as are attempts at healing, including proliferation of connective tissue (fibrosis) and endothelial cells (neovascularization). Prolonged severe, necrotizing injury with inability of the tissue to repair may elicit chronic active inflammation in which macrophages are still the predominant cell type; however, neutrophils still comprise a large proportion of the inflammatory cells. Granulomatous inflammation occurs in response to inhaled foreign bodies, some infectious agents, or exposure to inhaled agents that are resistant to degradation and clearance. The inflammatory cell infiltrate is predominantly activated macrophages, some of which are epithelioid and multinucleated, accompanied by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils.\n",

In both epithelial types, the degree of irritation, sensitivity of the mucosa to the irritant, and integrity of the mucociliary apparatus generally determine the course of the toxic response to inhaled chemicals and particles. The transitional epithelium may be especially sensitive. The increased sensitivity may be due in part to its anterior location in the nasal passage, to the thinner mucous blanket covering this epithelium, or to the paucity of ciliated cells in this region, which results in a more slowly moving mucous blanket. Exposure to irritants such as ozone will cause proliferative and metaplastic responses in the transitional epithelium at concentrations that have little effect on the squamous, respiratory, or olfactory epithelia. The lesions may be superficial, or involve the full thickness of the epithelium extending to the lamina propria. If the irritant is relatively mild and the exposure is of short duration, goblet cell metaplasia and mucous secretion may be the only response. A purely serous inflammation is often seen in the nasal cavity in response to mild irritants; microscopically, the serous exudate contains few or no inflammatory cells. Highly irritant chemicals will elicit a more varied and extensive response in the epithelium and associated glands. This may include epithelial cell vacuolation and loss of cilia, or more severe forms of degeneration, inflammation, epithelial necrosis and ulceration, and necrosis, atrophy, or hyperostosis of the turbinates. During the reparative response, a single layer of flattened regenerating cells or, with continued injury, two or more layers of undifferentiated polyhedral cells, may replace the ciliated and secretory cells. These lesions may progress to hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and hyperkeratosis, with persistent injury. Hyperplasia, particularly when atypical, may be an indication of incipient neoplasia.

Lesions may include epithelial cell vacuolation, degeneration, and/or necrosis, loss of sustentacular and neuroepithelial cells, and consequently, decreased thickness or atrophy of the epithelium. Regeneration follows and may be accompanied by epithelial and basal cell hyperplasia and, frequently, respiratory epithelial and squamous metaplasia. These epithelial responses may involve the submucosal (Bowman\u2019s) glands. These glands are often a prime target because the P-450 metabolizing enzyme content in these cells may produce metabolites that are toxic to the glandular epithelium. Atrophy and/or loss of the nerve bundles in the lamina propria is a common finding. The regenerative or hyperplastic epithelium is often quite disorganized, which may simply be due to a lack of structural support normally maintained by the sustentacular cells. Respiratory epithelial metaplasia is a unique but common response to irritants. In addition to the epithelium of the ethmoid turbinates, this change is often found in the olfactory epithelium that lines the dorsal meatus in the Level II section of the nasal cavity. The olfactory neurons are extremely sensitive to the effects of noxious gases. The protection offered by the metaplastic respiratory epithelium may be due to a thicker mucus blanket.",

In Sprague-Dawley rats, acute inhalation exposure (3 h) to cigarette smoke caused alterations in genes encoding the oxidative stress-response pathways (Nrf2 signaling) and phase I and II metabolizing enzymes in the nasal epithelium and lungs. However, the same exposure over a 3-week period resulted in a markedly reduced oxidative stress and phase II responsive genes but not in phase I gene expression pattern indicating an adaptive response in both nasal epithelium and lungs (Gebel et al., 2004). Formaldehyde targets the respiratory epithelium causing dose dependent epithelial degeneration, respiratory cell hypertrophy, squamous metaplasia, cell proliferation and nasal tumors in the rat (Monticello et al., 1996). The toxic effects of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde on the nasal cavity have been reported (Schroeter et al., 2014). At 2 ppm formaldehyde, pathways associated with cellular stress, thiol transport/reduction, inflammation and cellular proliferation were upregulated, whereas, at 6 ppm and greater, pathways associated with cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis, ERBB, EGFR, WNT, TGF-beta, Hedgehog and Notch signaling were enriched. Formaldehyde exposure also altered miRNA expression in the nose (Andersen et al., 2010). Based on gene expression and toxicokinetic data, along with histological examination for cell proliferation, the authors suggested that there are dose/duration transitions for the formaldehyde-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity in the nasal tissues.",

            "text": "Examination of the protein expression in the nasal tissue is usually performed as a part of the validation of the transcriptomic studies and to examine the enzyme induction, to determine the cell of origin in cytotoxicity and neoplasia within the nasal epithelium. One of the major challenges for immunolocalization of the proteins in nasal epithelium is the tissue processing. The typical decalcification processes using either 5\u201310% formic acid or 10% hydrogen chloride may degrade the native protein structure within the nasal epithelium, and immunohistochemical localization of proteins in these decalcified tissues is typically not successful. Gentler decalcification methods such as 14% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at pH 7\u20137.6 for 2\u20133 weeks, RapidCal\u00b7 Immuno (BBC biochemical, Mount Vernon, WA) for 2 h, or Immunocal (Decal Chemical Corporation, Congers, NY) for 6 days are preferred for rat nasal immunohistochemical studies. In spite of these gentler decalcification processes, independent optimization of the immunohistochemical parameters is still often necessary for successful localization of proteins in nasal tissues (Harris et al., 2013). Alternatively, dissection of the respective nasal epithelium from various regions allows for direct measurement of the CYP enzymes and metabolic intermediates of nasal toxins (Dunston et al., 2013).",

Based on the differential distribution of these biotransformation enzymes, differential regional susceptibility to various nasal toxins has been demonstrated (Morris and Shusterman, 2010). Naphthalene is metabolized within the nasal epithelium by CYP enzymes to an unstable 1,2-epoxide that undergoes further epoxidation and/or glutathione conjugation. Upon saturation of the CYP metabolic pathway, tissue injury occurs. Parenteral administration of naphthalene causes diffuse cytotoxicity of the nasal olfactory mucosa whereas with inhalation exposure, tissue injury is confined to dorsal medial meatus. Measuring the CYP enzymes and naphthalene metabolites within the nasal epithelium from the dorsal medial meatus and the ethmoturbinates from the distal regions demonstrated that the differential susceptibility of parenteral versus inhalation exposure was due to the differences in extent of naphthalene distribution within the tissues (Lee et al., 2005).",

Formaldehyde can cause inter- and intra-DNA crosslinks, base adducts and DNA-protein crosslinks. It induces N-hydroxymethyl mono-adducts primarily on guanine, adenine and cytosine, and N-methylene crosslinks between adjacent purines in DNA resulting in DNA damage (Kawanishi et al., 2014). Examination of Tp53 mutations from formaldehyde-induced rat nasal squamous cell carcinomas indicated G:C to T:A/C:G transversions, and G:C to A:T transitions (Recio et al., 1992).
