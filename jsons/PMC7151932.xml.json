Febrile respiratory illnesses and respiratory failure can signify a natural outbreak (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, plague, tularemia, or a novel strain of influenza) or a bioterrorism event.1, 2 Most cases of febrile respiratory illnesses admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are caused by community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) subsequently develop in up to 11% of these community-acquired pneumonia cases.3, 4 Although most cases of community-acquired pneumonia are recognizable, the rare and contagious causes (e.g., plague) can have a large impact on the health care and public health systems.2, 5 Thus, early recognition of these infections becomes important for two reasons. First, early infection control and public health preparedness strategies must be implemented to reduce spread to health care workers and the public, particularly in the acute stages of disease when patients are most contagious and most likely to undergo aerosol-generating diagnostic procedures. Second, intentional release of these agents is a bioterrorism event, and public health and law enforcement authorities are now trained to provide immediate investigation and support. Therefore, early suspicion of a bioterrorism or outbreak event, along with early protective measures and public health contact, will reduce the likelihood of transmission to health care workers, visitors, patients, and the community.",

For example, in the 14th century, the Tartars catapulted plague-infected corpses into Kaffa, leading to disease spread and defeat of the city (also starting the second wave of the Black Death in Europe).9 In the New World, smallpox-contaminated blankets may have been distributed by early settlers to natives in an effort to overcome the siege of Fort Pitt. However, bioterrorism took form in the last 100 years with extensive biowarfare units in World War I and II.7, 8 Notably, Unit 731 of the Japanese army in World War II used anthrax, plague, cholera, and typhoid on Chinese prisoners with high mortality, but the transition to the battlefield was less successful.7, 8, 9 The Cold War saw both the United States and the former Soviet Union develop bioweapon stockpiles that have since been dismantled. However, over the past 25 years, there has been an increase in individual-initiated bioterrorism, culminating in the anthrax outbreak in 2001 that used the postal service for distribution, causing 22 cases.7, 8, 10\n",

Fewer specific public health responses are required (Table 40-2\n).7\nCategory C agents are considered future or potential threats because they are easily available and can have a high mortality, but they have not been documented or engineered successfully (Table 40-3\n).14 Although all of these agents can potentially cause serious disease, the category A agents, along with select category B agents, would be seen by clinicians and have the greatest impact on the public and health care system.

The lesions first appear as small erythematous macules on the mucous membranes, tongue, and face (herald spots).24, 25, 29 The lesions spread in a centrifugal fashion, with macules evolving into papules, then vesicles, and finally the classic pustules (pox) (Fig. 40-3\n) by day 5 to 7 of the rash (see Table 40-4). Fever usually resolves during the eruptive phase but may persist after the pustules develop. Crusting and healing begin by day 14 of the rash.",

Infected fleas bite their rodent hosts, inoculating the rodent. Mortality in these animals is lower than in nonrodent mammals, and disease is passed from infected rodent to flea and the life cycle continues. Y. pestis is transmitted to humans by bites from rodent-infected fleas, scratches or bites from infected animals, exposure to infected humans, or bioterrorism.33, 34 Bites by infected fleas are the most common mode of transmission; squirrels, rabbits, domestic and wild cats, and prairie dogs are the most common sources of infected fleas. Large rodent or other animal die-offs, particularly in more susceptible species, may herald a large epidemic in nature.33, 34 Plague is found worldwide; in the United States endemic disease is concentrated in the western states; most likely because of introduction of Y. pestis\u2013infected rats through the ports of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle in the late 19th century.35\n",

Thus the clinical findings of cranial nerve palsies, particularly in the appropriate clinical setting (e.g., heroin use, or ingestion of the same food as another person with botulism) should prompt consideration of botulism (see Table 40-5). Laboratory diagnosis is by toxin detection or organism isolation.45 Detection of toxin in blood or stool is most reliable.51 The growth of C. botulinum from a stool or wound sample with the corresponding clinical findings can also confirm the diagnosis. Electromyography will also support the diagnosis if toxin and organism isolation is unsuccessful. There are no specific radiologic changes seen with botulism. Low lung volumes on chest radiographs may be seen but are not specific (see Table 40-6).",

Monitoring for impending respiratory failure and providing mechanical ventilation when needed are the highest priorities. An equine trivalent antitoxin (against serotypes A, B, and E) is available from state public health departments and the CDC, and is directed at neutralization of toxin that has not yet entered cells. Botulinum antitoxin cannot reverse botulinum intoxication48, 49, 52 (see Table 40-7). While the antitoxin is widely used in cases of botulism, its efficacy has only been inferred and, since the available antitoxin is derived from immunized horses, anaphylaxis and/or serum sickness can develop in 9% to 20% of recipients. A human-derived antitoxin is available but only for infant botulism. Human monoclonal antibodies have been prepared that neutralize multiple types of botulinum toxins, and these provide the potential for use in adults with a lower risk of adverse effects than the equine antiserum.53 In wound botulism, after wound drainage, antibiotic administration is useful; penicillin or clindamycin are the drugs of choice.48, 49 In food-borne and inhalation botulism, because the disease results from exposure to the toxin and not from infection, antibiotics are not efficacious. In all cases of botulism, routine monitoring of forced vital capacity is recommended, with early intubation if the vital capacity falls below 10 mL/kg (approximately 30% predicted). There is no direct prophylaxis for exposure, but in the setting of high-risk threats, a vaccine directed against serotypes A and E is available and has been largely used in the military.52 Patients die of botulism due to respiratory failure without ventilatory support or from complications during critical care.",

The Crimean-Congo and Rift Valley fever viruses belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Only the Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and Arenaviridae are listed as category A agents. The Filoviridae family serves as a classic template for viral hemorrhagic fevers and is largely discussed here.54 Marburg virus has a single species, while Ebola virus has five different species that vary in virulence in humans.55, 56 Transmission appears to be through contact with blood or secretions of nonhuman primates and infected individuals. People have become infected after handling primate products, after consuming nonhuman primate meat, or after exposure to symptomatic patients, including in hospitals. Several cases have presented due to exposure in laboratories. The use of hemorrhagic fever viruses as bioterrorism agents has also been postulated, largely based on their high contagiousness in aerosolized primate models.55, 56 The animal reservoir for these viruses was initially thought to be wild primates, but has recently been tentatively identified to be bats, which transmit the infection to nonhuman primates in the wild.",

In some patients, coagulation becomes impaired with the appearance of increased conjunctival and soft tissue bleeding. In some of the reported outbreaks, hemorrhage can be massive in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts and, in rare instances, the lung.56, 57 In the outbreak of Ebola virus disease centered in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2014, hemorrhage was not prominent; instead, the clinical picture was dominated by voluminous diarrhea.57a, 57b The onset of maculopapular rash on the arms and trunk may be a very distinctive sign (Fig. 40-6\n). Along with volume depletion and hypotension, multiorgan failure can develop and often leads to death (see Table 40-4). Outbreaks and cases have largely been described in developing countries where critical care resources are limited, thus experience with mechanical ventilation and the development of ARDS is not well documented.

Upon admission, cases of acute febrile illness and respiratory failure should undergo initial diagnostic testing, including pretreatment Gram stain, respiratory culture, and urine antigen testing for Legionella. If an etiologic agent is identified on initial screening and clinical findings (i.e., gram-positive diplococci with a lobar pneumonia on radiograph), targeted treatment should be initiated, with appropriate isolation precautions based on the pathogen. However, if an agent is not easily identified, patients should be placed in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. If multiple cases with similar symptoms or a case with an uncommon epidemiologic link is determined, patients should be isolated and public health officials should be contacted. If specific clinical features subsequently arise, then directed diagnostic testing should be performed. If no clear etiology is detected, further evaluation is warranted with invasive and expanded testing. Although bronchoscopy generates aerosols that increase the risk of transmission, bronchoscopy should be performed with appropriate protection of personnel in these cases, because identification of the etiology of illness is an essential component of an appropriate public health response. The public health authorities and the institutional infection control should be contacted as early as possible when clinical suspicion of bioterrorism arises or when diagnostic tests do not yield results.",

As these cases progress, the cumulative number of cases with severe respiratory illness will increase, potentially stressing the critical care system and leading to a sustained need for emergency mass critical care (EMCC) for weeks to months. Sustained EMCC can lead to depletion of critical care resources, such as mechanical ventilators, specially trained staff, antibiotics and antivirals, and ICU beds.5 Thus, the unique issues associated with sustained EMCC have led to improved planning for a response to a bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases outbreak.89, 90\n",

            "text": "Recent consensus statements have recommended special critical care preparedness to include ICU capacity expansion, critical care resource storage, and the coordination of critical care across communities to a regional and statewide level.89, 90 Capacity for critical care should be approximately three times normal ICU capacity, with all critically ill patients to be located in acute care hospitals (less severely ill patients will be diverted to alternative sites within the community). Each hospital should have enough supplies for 10 days for each critically ill patient along with plans to have expanded care by noncritical care specialists in the case of a shortage.91 ICU admission should be limited to the most severely ill. Most importantly, establishment of a triage mechanism is required for the allocation of scarce resources in sustained EMCC, with the most identified critical resource being mechanical ventilation and medical oxygen.92 This triage mechanism shifts the focus of critical care from optimal care of the individual to optimal care for the population and would identify critically ill patients who may not get specific scarce resources during a period of limited supply in an outbreak. It would include inclusion and exclusion criteria for ICU admission along with a triage scoring mechanism for patient assessment. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score is valuable, due to its value in sequential assessments and its ease of use given its lower reliance on laboratory data. Additional triage scoring systems may be warranted in future outbreaks as disease and outbreak conditions change.Key Points\n\u25aaBioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases present unique and different diagnostic and treatment challenges.\u25aaCategory A agents are considered the highest risk to the public and national security for the following reasons: (1) easy person-to-person spread; (2) high mortality; (3) major public health impact causing panic and social disruption; and (4) requirement for specific and specialized public health emergency response (e.g., public prophylaxis or protective equipment). Diseases caused by these agents initially present with a nonspecific prodrome that develops into severe disease with specific epidemiologic hallmarks.\u25aaCategory A agents are anthrax, smallpox, plague, tularemia, botulism, and viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Ebola, Lassa).\u25aaCategory B agents are diverse but carry lower morbidity and mortality, with some having few to no pulmonary manifestations.\u25aaCategory C agents have the potential for future use as bioterrorism agents.\u25aaEarly recognition relies on the astute clinician, with early involvement of public health and institutional infection control personnel to reduce spread to health care workers and the community.\u25aaAggressive supportive care is the mainstay for all critically ill patients infected with a bioterrorism agent. Targeted therapy is under development.\u25aaFor inhalational anthrax, raxibacumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against B. anthracis protective antigen, has been approved for use and should be used in combination with antibiotics when the diagnosis of inhalation anthrax is suspected or confirmed.\u25aaDuring an outbreak of a category A agent, emergency mass critical care for a sustained period may be required, leading to depletion of critical patient care resources. With emergency mass critical care, the focus of critical care shifts from optimal care of the individual to optimal care for the population. Predictive mortality scores are recommended for appropriate triage of the critically ill.\n\n",
