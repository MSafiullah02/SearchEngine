            "text": "Infectious diseases are caused by a variety of microoganisms including bacteria and viruses and can often lead to a decrease in the quality of life and increased (risks of) mortality. In 2016, 1.6 million people died due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) alone. The infectious disease burden can be delineated using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Infectious diseases were listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a number of the top contributing issues. With regard to what was infectious disease-related, the DALYs for lower respiratory infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis were 1939, 855, and 763 per 100,000 and were ranked as 2nd, 11th, and 12th, respectively, in 2015 [1]. Various therapeutic and preventative interventions have been used to combat infectious diseases. Vaccination in particular has played a critical role in preventing, treating, and even eradicating diseases (i.e., smallpox). Poliomyelitis or polio is another deadly infectious disease that mainly affects children. The inactivated polio vaccine and oral polio vaccine are two types of vaccines that helped reduce polio by 99% worldwide; and now 80% of the population worldwide live in polio-free regions [2], [3]. As of 2016, inactivated polio vaccine immunizations have helped to globally eradicate wild poliovirus type 2 serotype.",

However, for other pathogens with hypervariability, vaccine efficacy may be more limited. DNA vaccines can be used to overcome this challenge, as the engineered DNA can encode specific antigens. DNA recombinant-based subunit vaccines have been known to have enhanced stability, to a degree, for transportation and storage in comparison to traditional protein-based vaccines. There is greater control over the risks of virulence reversion when using DNA vaccines; therefore, DNA vaccines are considered in some aspects to be safer. Because of this, DNA vaccines can have potentially greater utility for immunocompromised patients. However, there are remaining issues that must be resolved for enabling DNA vaccines to be clinically translated for human use. The main remaining issue is the lack of immunogenicity associated with DNA vaccines. The current state of DNA vaccines is discussed within this review article.",

Extensive reviews have been written containing information regarding vaccine classifications, namely: live attenuated vaccines [4]; polysaccharide vaccines [5], [6]; inactivated vaccines [7]; and DNA vaccines [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Fig. 1\nshows the number of publications between 1931 and April 2018 for different types of vaccines, which can be an indicator of popularity. We report values based on PubMed results using EndNote between 1931 and 2020, where the projected values, as indicated by an asterisk \u2018*\u2019 for 2011\u20132020, were calculated by multiplying the current values by the ratio 120/87.5 (number of total months within the timeframe of interest divided by the number of months to date). DNA vaccines, in particular, show an increased number of PubMed results when compared to other vaccine types. However, the hype of DNA vaccines is dampened, thereby reaching a plateau, likely owing to difficulties in achieving sufficient immunogenic levels for protection. DNA vaccines, however, can be engineered to have effectively zero risk for virulence reversion.",

The first step consists of inserting the gene of interest (GOI) into the plasmid vector, followed by transformation into replicating bacteria or yeast. After the replication, the recombinant protein is extracted, purified, and prepared as a vaccine. In the case of DNA vaccines, the replicating vector is usually disrupted and the engineered DNA is extracted and purified to produce the final vaccine. After administration to the patient, recombinant protein vaccines are internalized within the host cells and processed to antigenic peptides, which elicit CD8+ T cell responses. The DNA vaccine must achieve being internalized by the nucleus to use the host molecular machinery to promote the transient expression of the GOI. After the transcription and translation of the GOI, it is processed to antigenic peptides, and these antigenic peptides elicit immune responses.",

Please note that in Fig. 2, certain cellular processes shown are generally for somatic cells (i.e., plasmid delivery), while other processes are for antigen presenting cells (APCs) (i.e., MHC I/II-peptide display). For example, the translated product within a somatic cell from a plasmid could transport extracellularly and then be uptaken by an APC. A vaccine is processed by three main pathways: direct somatic cell engulfment/APC display (Fig. 2(1, 5, 3), thus leading to MHC II-peptide display); phagocytosis of a transfected (nonviral) or transformed (viral) cell/cross-priming (Fig. 2(1, 4, 6), thus leading to MHC I-peptide display); and Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation (Fig. 2(2, 7)). A vaccine may be taken up intracellularly by endocytosis within APCs (Fig. 2(1)) [15] or interact extracellularly by the TLR2/4 pathway, thereby resulting in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin (IL)-8/10, TNF\u03b1) (Fig. 2(2)). When nonviral gene delivery systems are used to deliver DNA vaccines, the proton sponge effect plays an important role for the pDNA to escape the endolysosomal degradation pathway (Fig. 2(3)). pDNA can be either randomly encapsulated by the nuclear envelope reforming postmitosis or actively transported to the nucleus through nuclear localization signals (i.e., DNA-targeted sequences \u2013 SV40 [16]). DNA vaccines may contain unmethylated CpG sequences that function as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and can activate TLR9 in the endosome, eventually releasing IL-4 and interferon (IFN)\u03b1 (Fig. 2(4)).",

For example, polysaccharide-based adjuvants can also improve the immunogenicity of vaccines. Chitosan is a known mucoadhesive and may exhibit important roles in mucosal immunization [82]. Sawaengsak, et al. [19] reported nanoparticles of chitosan combined with tripolyphosphate and hemagglutinin (HA) induced a two-fold increase in the number of splenocytes that secrete IFN\u03b3 in mice infected with the influenza virus when compared with a nonadjuvanted HA vaccine [20]. Gordon, et al. [21], [22] reported that inulin-based adjuvants (Advax\u00ae) elicit efficient immune responses against hepatitis B (Phase I). At least a fourfold increase in seroprotection and CD4+ T-cell responsiveness was observed for subjects immunized with Advax\u00ae when compared to HBsAg alone. However, biopolymers have difficulties to control drug release owing to their solubility in water. For example, a report comparing pectin content demonstrated that higher pectin content resulted in increased erosion, thus leading to faster drug release; on the basis of the type of application, this concept can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the length scale of drug release desired [23]. The reported pectin/amylose formulations released \u223c50%\u2013100% of the drug within a 4 h timeframe in a gastrointestinal context.",

A GOI can be inserted into a self-replicating organism (bacteria or yeast). A circular pDNA is usually used as the DNA cloning vector, which can then be extracted from the replicating organism and chemically purified [43]. The pDNA can be engineered to be expressed in bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli (E. coli)) [44] or yeast (i.e., Pichia pastoris) [45], [46] for amplification purposes in bioreactors and can also be expressed in mammalian cells for a therapeutic purpose. The major components involved within an engineered DNA plasmid are the origin of replication, promoter, GOI, and commonly an antibiotic resistance gene for selection [47]. As for E. coli-based plasmid production, the composition of the culture media can vary from mineral-containing media to complex mixtures supplemented with yeast extracts. After replication in the bioreactor, bacteria can undergo a lysing process through alkaline or thermal treatments, followed by plasmid purification through precipitation/centrifugation [48], [49]. This large-scale pDNA production is cost-effective in comparison to LAV and IV manufacturing processes, possibly making the technology cheaper in the long run for consumers. The relatively recent development of minicircles (episomal DNA)/miniplasmids (i.e., P1, P7, and F)/ministrings [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55] can potentially be transported more easily through cellular barriers to improve bioavailability [51].",

Despite nonviral gene delivery systems being safer than viral vectors, risks of insertional mutagenesis are not zero, although the risks are believed to be lower than those of everyday random mutations. Unfortunately, often such nonviral risks are based on the insertion of a functional fluorescence-based marker where the entire functional sequence must be inserted not only within the genome but also into a region that is expressed. Nonviral risks of insertional mutagenesis may be higher than that currently believed. Such risks are also a function of the sequence and whether the DNA is supercoiled.",

In the case of incorporation into an exon, an insertional mutation or a frameshift mutation occurs. Such mutations can cause a gene to malfunction or inactivate (i.e., a tumor suppressor gene). The insertion of foreign genes into the host genome could also lead to constituent expression of previously silent bacterial/parasite genes that have been inserted. The insertion may also increase the probability of rearrangements or breaking. The guidelines for industrial production of DNA vaccines published by the FDA recommend that the pDNA is supercoiled to more than 80% to help prevent insertional mutagenesis. It has been reported that the FDA recommends integration studies, regardless of the delivery method, if there are greater than 10,000 copies of foreign DNA per microgram of host DNA [71]. Interestingly, minicircle DNA [51], [53], [54], [72], [73] and ministring DNA [74], [75] have been reported to have less risk of insertional mutagenesis because the major bacterial DNA (i.e., the unmethylated CpG repeats functioning as PAMPs) is removed.",

Karni, et al. [77] investigated the thermal degradation rates of pDNA (0.75 \u00b5g of pUC19) and found that there was complete degradation after 9 min at 170 \u00b0C in an aqueous solution. When the pDNA was incubated at 200 \u00b0C under aqueous conditions, no intact pDNA could be found after 20 s. In the case of dried pDNA, the degradation temperature was reported to have a low threshold. They incubated pDNA and pUC19 at 10 \u00b0C increments for 5 min and found that pDNA started degrading at 130 \u00b0C and completely degraded at approximately 190 \u00b0C (in comparison to degradation at 95 \u00b0C).

A particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) gene gun was used in preclinical trials to deliver a DNA vaccine against the dengue virus in nonhuman primates. Plasmids, including the oligonucleotide sequence of the vaccine antigen, were precipitated onto 1 \u00b5m-diameter gold beads. The DNA-adsorbed gold beads were then delivered using a gas-pressurized gene gun, which is a needle-free device [96]. The difference in PMED in terms of IM and intradermal injections using a needle and syringe is that PMED enables direct delivery of the vaccine into the intracellular environment more efficiently, thereby improving the cellular uptake and resulting in higher immune responses with substantially lower doses (100- to 1000-fold) of DNA [97]. Choi, et al. [98] compared three different delivery methods (IM, intradermal, and epidermal inoculation) using plasmid-coated gold beads through particle-pressurized bombardment (i.e., gene gun). The intradermal injection and gene gun resulted in specific IgG antibody responses but not IgA. Despite the induction of IgG responses, both the gene gun and intradermal administration methods failed to protect mice from a rotavirus infection in that particular study.",

Similar results were also reported in a previous work on hepatoma cells [110] and glioblastoma cells [111]. The exact mechanisms of chemical structure-related cell specificity remain unknown. However, it is important to note that the cell specificity of the nonviral gene delivery system was not due to factors such as cellular division rate, cellular uptake amounts of nanoparticles, or media composition. Although the exact mechanism remains elusive, it is hypothesized that different pathways of endocytosis, tuned by different polymer structures, may be the answer to the cell specificity differences. Understanding the Structure Activity Relationships (SARs) is an ongoing endeavor within the field. Enabling the ability to engineer optimized delivery systems is the objective in elucidating such SARs.",

Several authors have observed enhanced endosomal escape using polyethyleneimine (PEI) conjugated to the pDNA to further enhance the \u201cproton sponge effect,\u201d which promotes endosomal swelling and rupture [114]. This effect occurs because of the buffering capacity of the unprotonated amine groups on PEI. The PEI becomes increasingly protonated during the acidification process of the endosomes and thus imbalanced osmotic pressure differences form across the membrane. This is due to influx of Cl\u2212 ions and water molecules into the endosome [115]. Other escape mechanisms have involved fusogenic peptides. For example, Nakase, et al. suggested the association between PEI and the fusogenic peptide GALA on the cationic lipid-coated exosomes, which increased endosomal escape of exosomes that are useful for nucleic acid delivery [116]. Hu, et al. [117] developed a DNA vaccine against malignant melanomas employing TAT-based fusogenic peptides with PEI-mannose nanoparticles adsorbed onto microneedles [118]. The use of the TAT-based fusogenic peptide resulted in T-cell activation and enhanced expression of IFN\u03b3 IL-12 [119].",

Because parental bacteria sequences are absent to a greater extent, the lack of CpG sequences has resulted in longer half-lives of the plasmid. However, for specific applications, encoding CpG is desirable for enhancing the immunogenic response. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that gene transfer using minicircles induces a 10- to 1000-fold increase in the long-term transgene expression in vivo and in vitro when compared to pDNA for specific applications, which can potentially improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines [125].",

The same group has also worked on designing computational tools such as the python language-based \u201cDNAplotlib\u201d library to visualize the gene circuit outline [141]. Another application using gene circuits and synthetic biology is the orthogonal polymerases, which independently control multiple pathways in the same cell [142]. Using multiple activator-chaperone pairs has also been observed to improve the orthogonality in gene circuits [143]. Moon, et al.

The immunostimulants and adjuvants, depending on the type, may require more complex storage and transportation conditions. Methods involving the use of cytokines (i.e., IL-4) or the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have proven useful in enhancing the immune response. For example, Kalams, et al. [144] reported that IL-12 and/or IL-15 produced a safe and immunogenic response for their HIV-1 Gag DNA vaccine. Kalams, et al. also evaluated the positive impact of EP delivery methods for the HIV-1 Gag antigen/IL-12 adjuvant plasmid vector in a phase I clinical trial. Other studies have also assessed the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines containing chemokine-expressing sequences for HIV-1 immunization [144], [145], [146]. The CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) is another common genetic adjuvant used for DNA vaccines [9], [147], [148]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CpG ODN activates TLR9-bearing B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells and further support the induction of strong Th1-type responses [149]. In addition to engineering the ratio of CpG motifs in DNA vaccines to improve immunogenicity, administering additional synthetic CpG ODNs or co-administering a second plasmid cloned with CpG motifs has been investigated. Kojima, et al. delivered a CpG-encoding plasmid 2 days and 4 days both before and after an HIV DNA vaccine was delivered (as well as at the same time). Results showed that a significant boost of HIV-specific IgG and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity can be obtained when the CpG plasmid was administered either 2 or 4 days after HIV DNA vaccination [150].",

A large and immediate T-cell immune response was observed after administering the rFPV boost in macaques 12 days after priming with DNA vaccines.

Because the gene-based formulations require greater safety evaluation than conventional vaccines (e.g., nucleic acid integration into the host\u2019s chromosomal genome), the timeline for approving DNA vaccines for humans is relatively lengthy. While many human DNA vaccines are still being evaluated in clinical trials, to the extent of our knowledge, there have been four DNA vaccines approved for veterinary applications. Overviews of DNA vaccines approved for animal models have been reported in several articles [154], [155], [156]. These approved DNA vaccines are for a number of species including equine, salmon, porcine, and canine. The earliest DNA vaccine approvals were obtained in 2005, namely, the West Nile\u2013Innovator\u00ae (equine) and Apex-IHN\u00ae (salmon). These two vaccines are prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases encoding subcomponents of the viral proteins for generating antibodies against the West Nile Virus and the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, respectively. In 2008, a single dose of vaccine expressing the growth hormone LifeTide\u00ae SW5 (i.e., porcine) was licensed for gene therapy. The latest approval was in 2010, namely, Oncept\u2122 (canine), which is used for cancer immunotherapy against oral melanoma (Table 3\n). Although the noninfectious vaccines are not the main focus of this review, the two vaccines are included in Table 3 to provide a wholistic picture of the current progress of DNA animal vaccines.",

However, the transfection efficiency of DNA plasmids is generally poor resulting in an insufficient induction of an immune response, which is possibly one of the greatest challenges in current clinical trials. As a result, more trials have been utilizing hybridized formulations (i.e., CpG) and/or higher DNA doses for greater expression levels and immunogenicity [151]. A number of current clinical trials for HIV infections are an example of such endeavors. The GOVX-B11 vaccine, currently in phase II, constitutes two components: a DNA vaccine used to prime a person\u2019s immune response and a recombinant MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara, attenuated vaccine) used to boost the primed response. Their studies were conducted in HIV-infected participants who were currently undergoing antiretroviral treatment. It has been demonstrated that GOVX-B11 is capable of eliciting antibodies and a T cell response against a heterologous challenge [158]. On the other hand, the PENNVAX DNA vaccines developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, currently in phase I, utilize the prime-boost strategy, similar to that of GOVX-B11, by combining a viral vector vaccine. Furthermore, Inovio demonstrated that the immune response can be enhanced when PENNVAX is delivered in vivo by intradermal EP compared to a syringe injection [52], [159]. These results reveal that the modification of DNA vaccine formulations or combinatorial delivery approaches can improve the potency and efficacy of DNA vaccines in human clinical trials.",

New technologies such as SEAL [161] are seriously needed and are likely to be highly impactful.
