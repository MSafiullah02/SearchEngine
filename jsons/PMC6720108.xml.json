The most common RPE used by HCWs are surgical masks and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs).[5,6] However, surgical masks are not able to provide barrier to sub-micrometer-size bioaerosols,[7,8] while N95 class filters are associated with high breathing resistance, which may be the reason for 1/3 of HCWs\u2019 headaches during long-term use of N95 FFRs.[9] In addition, annual fit-testing is required for N95 FFRs since face seal leakage would significantly affect the achieved protection.[10,11]",

Firstly, PAPRs offer higher assigned protection factors (APF) ranging from 25 (loose-fitting PAPRs) to 1,000 (full facepiece tight-fitting PAPRs), whereas the APF for N95 FFRs is 10.[14] Other significant advantages of using PAPRs are the decreased breathing effort and the cooling effect on the face. In addition, loose-fitting PAPRs do not require annual fit-testing and can be used by HCWs who cannot achieve a good fit with N95 FFRs due to facial hair or other factors.[15]",

            "text": "Given that a loose-fitting PAPR is not designed to completely seal to the face or neck, if inspiratory flow exceeds the airflow delivered by the blower (over breathing), unfiltered air may leak in.[16] It was found that with increasing inspiratory flow, the manikin fit factors for a loose-fitting PAPR decreased exponentially.[17] Therefore, the determination of minimum operational flow is crucial for a loose-fitting PAPR. PAPRs were originally developed to protect various industrial workers from workplace airborne hazards.[3] The minimum air flow rates for NIOSH-approved tight-fitting and loose-fitting PAPRs are 115 L/min and 170 L/min, respectively.[14] These testing flow rates were mainly obtained from industrial workplaces, primarily mining.[18,19] Industrial settings often require workers to perform moderate to high effort job activities,[20] therefore PAPRs used in those conditions must provide sufficient air flows to satisfy the breathing demands for the workers. However, the workplace environments experienced by HCWs differ significantly from the industrial conditions, especially pertaining to physical exertion when performing routine work activities.[21]",

The differential pressure sensor is mounted inside the mask to measure breathing resistance/pressure drop (\u25b3P). A reading is taken every 0.02 sec and stored in the data logger, which can be belt or pocket mounted. The battery capacity allows sampling for at least a full 8-hr work shift. After sampling, each reading of \u25b3P is converted into a respiratory flow rate through a pre-calibrated \u25b3P-flow curve. The maximum flow measurement for the device is 400\u2013500 L/min.",

Some of the exercises may be omitted, while other exercises (e.g., changing curtain, Figure 1) may be added. Since this is a field investigation in real hospital patient rooms, observers were not allowed to step inside to visually determine the exact time period of each exercise. Furthermore, for all nine subjects tested, it was found that the change of MV, MIF, and PIF during the 30-min \u201cisolation unit work\u201d was minimal. Therefore, data analyses were performed for the entire 30-min \u201cisolation unit work\u201d. The minimum, average \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), and maximum values of the MV, MIF, and PIF for the nine HCWs were reported (Table 4).",

The Pearson correlations of MV, MIF and PIF with weight, ADu and BMI were all positive and statistically significant. Since both ADu and BMI are expressions of weight and height,[20,22] and height was not statistically significant (may be caused by its narrow range: 1.50\u20131.65 m), the results suggest that weight has a significant effect on subjects\u2019 inspiratory flow. As the subjects\u2019 weight increased, the inspiratory flow increased significantly. The correlations of MV, MIF, and PIF with age were negative, indicating that with the increase of age, inspiratory flow tends to decrease, although this decrement was not statistically significant.",
