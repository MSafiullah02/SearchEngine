(Biosafety conditions are described as biosafety levels in four categories [BSL 1\u20134], with BSL-3 and BSL-4 recommended for work with pathogens that cause serious human and animal disease). It seems that transmission occurred as a result of inappropriate laboratory procedures that led to cross-contamination of the West Nile virus specimen with SARS-CoV. No other workers in the laboratory, and none of the medical staff who cared for the student while he was ill, became secondarily infected, nor did household and other contacts.",

These conditions were met in the smallpox laboratory in Birmingham in 1979, and in at least two of the laboratories associated with the recent cases of SARS during 2003. If the resulting human infection causes viral shedding, with exposure to susceptible workers in the laboratory, health-care system, or community, an outbreak can result. In the outbreak in Brimingham after the smallpox laboratory accident, infection spread from the initial case to a close family member and one other. In the current outbreak of SARS, chains of transmission seem to have moved from the laboratory, to a close family member, and to a hospital, from where a nurse who treated the laboratory worker then transmitted infection to five others.",

During the SARS outbreak last year, many specimens were obtained from human cases of SARS and sent to many different national and international laboratories for various studies. In April, 2003, WHO provided guidelines for handling, packing, and shipping SARS specimens, and listed laboratory practices that could safely be done under BSL-2 and those that required BSL-3.7 These guidelines were reviewed and updated during later WHO consultations, and laboratory research activities continue at many of these sites.8 Unfortunately, adherence to these guidelines has now failed at two, and possibly three, different laboratories, reaffirming the importance of strong national, and possibly international, monitoring of their implementation. The predictable emergence of new dangerous pathogens in the future further highlights the need for such action.",

That poliovirus reintroduction could occur was seen in 1992 when a reference strain of wild-poliovirus type I that is used in the production of inactivated poliovirus vaccine was isolated from a young child being investigated for diarrhoea.9 The subsequent epidemiological investigation found that the child's father was employed at a production site for inactivated poliovirus vaccine where an accident had occurred. Fortunately the child was fully immunised against poliovirus. But the child served as a healthy carrier of poliovirus to the community, although sanitation was adequate and poliovirus vaccination coverage was high enough to prevent an outbreak. A similar poliovirus reintroduction from a laboratory or production facility for poliovirus vaccine to one of the many countries that have indicated their intention to stop poliovirus immunisation after certification of global eradication could result in future outbreaks of poliomyelitis.10\n",

Through the comprehensive surveys of national laboratories that are underway or completed in 152 countries in five continents, over 160 000 facilities have been inventoried to date. About 500 facilities have reported wild-type poliovirus or potential infectious materials. At the same time, technical and engineering solutions have allowed the continued production of inactivated poliovirus vaccine from wild poliovirus under enhanced BSL-3 conditions to ensure that such a vaccine is available to the countries that choose to continue routine immunisation against the poliovirus after eradication has been certified globally and the routine use of oral poliovirus vaccine stopped.12\n",

A biosafety strategy for minimising the risk of a laboratory accident with the Sabin polio-virus is under development. In addition, consensus is being sought on the mechanisms and procedures for ensuring that the necessary stockpiles of oral poliovirus vaccine are available should poliovirus be reintroduced into human populations because of a laboratory accident.",

SARS-CoV seems to represent a high laboratory risk. Unlike SARS-CoV, poliovirus is not efficiently transmitted by droplets from person to person, and a vaccine is available that fully protects laboratory workers from disease and reduces the risk of infection, thereby providing additional assurances against substantial consequences should a laboratory accident occur once routine immunisation with oral poliovirus vaccine has stopped. It is also reassuring that no further accidents have occurred with the smallpox virus stored in two reference laboratories for over 20 years. Nevertheless, the recent laboratory accidents with SARS-CoV are a stark reminder that the security of public-health achievements requires greater investment to ensure that global biosafety standards for dangerous pathogens in laboratories are universally adopted, strictly adhered to, closely monitored, and rigorously enforced.",
