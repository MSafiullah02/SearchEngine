Elucidation of the mechanisms behind these associations will require extensive 152 experimental work. A straightforward, even if, likely, over-simplified explanation could be that the larger 153 number of genes to be translated by the virus lengthens its replication cycle, under the assumption that 154 the number of translation initiation events and/or subgenomic RNAs that need to be transcribed are 155 rate-limiting factors in virus reproduction. Similarly, a higher GC content leads to the formation of 156 stable secondary structures in the virus RNA, with higher kinetic barriers that the ribosome then needs 157 to disrupt during translation, resulting in longer translation times 12 . Thus, one possible explanation for 158 the association between the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content and longer incubation 159 periods is that the longer cumulative translation time extends the replication cycle and consequently, 160 the incubation period. Alternatively or additionally, extra genes could contribute to more complex 161",
