            "text": "The DEAD-box RNA helicases play multi-functional roles in RNA transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA transport, translation initiation and RNA decay (Edgcomb et al., 2012, Fuller-Pace, 2013, Ishaq et al., 2009, Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2010). Recently evidence in the literature suggests that interactions with RNA helicases contribute to the lifecycle of positive sense RNA viruses. For example, DDX1 facilitates replication of a number of viruses such as: Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by interacting with HIV-1 Rev protein (Edgcomb et al., 2012); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM strain (JHMV) through interactions with nsp14 (Xu et al., 2010) and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (Wu et al., 2014); and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) by binding to the 3\u2032(+) UTR and 5\u2032(\u2212) UTR (Tingting et al., 2006). Besides DDX1, DDX3, facilitates replication of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) through interactions with JEV NS3 and NS5 proteins, and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR (Li et al., 2014); HIV-1 by interactions with HIV-1 Tat (Lai et al., 2013, Yasuda-Inoue et al., 2013) and HIV-1 Rev and cellular export receptor CRM1 (Lai et al., 2013); HCV by binding to the HCV core protein (Ariumi et al., 2007, Owsianka and Patel, 1999); and West Nile virus by binding to NS3 at viral replication sites (Chahar et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The New World alphavirus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) harbors a single stranded, positive sense RNA ranging \u223c11 kb in length that codes for 4 non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) from the genomic RNA and 5 structural proteins (capsid, envelope 3 (E3), E2, 6K and E1) from the subgenomic RNA (Foy et al., 2013a, Go et al., 2014). The structural proteins ultimately interact to form viral particles and the functions of the individual proteins are well understood (Atasheva et al., 2010a, Atasheva et al., 2010b, Foy et al., 2013a, Garmashova et al., 2007, Leung et al., 2011, Malygin et al., 2009, Parker et al., 2010, Snyder et al., 2013). The non-structural proteins (nsPs) are primarily responsible for viral replication (Foy et al., 2013a, Jose et al., 2009, Shin et al., 2012, Weaver and Barrett, 2004). We previously identified that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with the host kinase IKK\u03b2 in infected cells and that this interaction was important for efficient viral multiplication (Amaya et al., 2014). We hypothesized that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with a subset of host proteins in infected cells to form a VEEV-nsP3 interactome (molecular interactions of host proteins with VEEV-nsP3); such that knockdown of the identified host proteins will influence VEEV multiplication. We employed a mass spectrometry (MS) based approach from which RNA helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 were identified to interact with VEEV-nsP3 in infected cells. To assess the requirement for these interactions in the viral lifecycle, siRNA mediated depletion of DDX1 and DDX3 indicated a decrease in infectious viral titers. Therefore, our studies demonstrate a potential role for DDX1 and DDX3 in the VEEV life cycle. Collectively, these results will aid future studies of the role of VEEV-nsP3 in context of the viral life cycle.",

The replication kinetics of rTC-83 and rTC-83-nsP3-HA in U87MG cells at a low (MOI:1) and high (MOI:10) MOI were compared to determine if insertion of the tag significantly impaired viral replication. Relative titers of infectious virus analyzed by plaque assay indicated that at the low MOI a minor lag in the replication kinetics was observed (Fig. 1B left) but at the higher MOI the replication kinetics of the tagged virus was comparable to that of the wild type rTC-83 (Fig. 1C left). Expression levels of the structural protein capsid (representative for viral protein expression) of rTC-83-nsP3-HA were comparable to that of rTC-83 (Fig. 1B and C, right). We determined nsP3 protein expression by virtue of the HA tag in whole cell extracts at later time points at the higher MOI (Fig. 1C, right, lanes 6 and 7). We next determined if insertion of the HA tag impacted intracellular viral RNA kinetics by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. Fig. 1D indicated that rTC-83-nsP3-HA replicated to high titers over the time course investigated in an MOI dependent manner when compared to rTC-83. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nsP3 could be immunoprecipitated by using the tag from infected cells at 6 hpi (Fig. 1E, lane 4). We also validated the IKK\u03b2:nsP3 interaction that we had reported in our previous publication using a plasmid construct that expressed nsP3 (Amaya et al., 2014) (Fig. S1A). Additionally, our confocal microscopy studies illustrated VEEV-nsP3 localizing as distinct cytoplasmic structures (as reported by others (Foy et al., 2013a, Foy et al., 2013b)). Within these structures, we were also able to observe localization of IKK\u03b2 at 12 hpi (Fig. S1B). Overall, rTC-83-nsP3-HA could replicate to high titers and appropriately express viral proteins. Taken together these results indicate that rTC-83-nsP3-HA can be utilized as a tool to yield biologically relevant data.",

Supernatants were collected at 6, 12 and 24 hpi and analyzed by plaque assay for infectious virions. In the DDX1 and DDX3 depleted infected cells, a \u223c70% decrease in infectious viral titers was observed at 6 hpi, whereas at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, a \u223c1log and 2log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed, respectively (Fig. 3C), suggesting a time dependent decrease in infectious viral titers in DDX1 and DDX3 depleted cells. Cell lysates from the experiment performed in Fig. 3C were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent blot was probed for VEEV capsid, DDX1, DDX3 and \u03b2-actin (Fig. 3D). Western blot analysis indicated that VEEV capsid levels were modestly reduced in DDX1 (Fig. 3D left) and DDX3 (Fig. 3D right) depleted cells when compared to the control. Capsid protein expression could not be detected as early as 6 hpi by western blot. In addition, intracellular and extracellular viral RNA was quantified by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. DDX1 or DDX3 depleted U87MG cells infected with rTC-83 were processed for q-RT-PCR at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. In DDX1 depleted cells a 1log decrease was observed at 6 and 12 hpi was observed whereas at 24 hpi a 50% decrease was observed in intracellular viral RNA replication when compared to the controls (Fig. 3E). A 2log decrease in intracellular viral RNA replication was observed at 6 and 12 hpi, and a 1log decrease was observed at 24 hpi in the DDX3 depleted cells when compared to the controls. It was observed in DDX1 depleted cells at 6, 12 and 24 hpi a 50%, 70% and a 1log decrease in extracellular viral RNA replication, respectively (Fig. 3F). In DDX3 depleted cells a \u223c1log decrease in extracellular viral RNA was observed at 6 and 12 hpi, whereas at 24 hpi a 2log decrease was observed when compared to the rTC-83 controls. Taken together, depletion of endogenous DDX1 and DDX3 at non-toxic concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in rTC-83 replication. This suggests that these RNA helicases positively regulate VEEV replication potential, with potentially, DDX3 having a comparatively greater impact on VEEV life cycle in the context of TC-83.",

Fig. 3G demonstrated a \u223c1log decrease with DDX1 siRNA, whereas \u223c55% decrease in viral titers was observed with DDX3 siRNA when compared to the control. From Fig. 3G it appears that although TrD multiplication was inhibited similar to that seen with rTC-83 at 24 hpi, the extent of inhibition differed by 1log, which may speak to the difference in viral virulence between the two strains. This data suggests that the virulent TrD strain utilizes DDX1 and DDX3 for viral multiplication although, the reliance on DDX3 may be lesser for the virulent strain. Collectively, the data indicates that VEEV utilizes DDX1 and DDX3 to facilitate viral replication.",

            "text": "Viruses such as HIV-1 (Edgcomb et al., 2012, Lai et al., 2013, Yasuda-Inoue et al., 2013) and HCV (Ariumi et al., 2007, Owsianka and Patel, 1999, Tingting et al., 2006) utilize both DDX1 and DDX3 to facilitate viral replication; likewise, in our studies, VEEV-nsP3 interacted with both DDX1 and DDX3. This opens the possibility that RNA helicases may serve compensatory roles in the viral life cycle. To address this we hypothesized that depletion of both DDX1 and DDX3 would result in a greater decrease in infectious viral titers than that observed in the individual depletion studies. Western blot analysis indicated that silencing of DDX1 and DDX3 was highly efficient as early as 48 h post transfection (Fig. 4\nA) at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 4B). To determine the impact of depleting both DDX1 and DDX3 on viral multiplication, U87MG cells transfected with control or DDX1 and DDX3 siRNA were infected with rTC-83 and supernatants were collected at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Plaque assay analysis indicated that in the DDX1/3 depletion scenario a 1log decrease in viral titers was observed at 6 hpi and 24 hpi, whereas at 12 hpi a 2log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the respective controls (Fig. 4C). The decrease observed in infectious viral titers using the combinatorial knockdown was modestly greater than with the individual knockdowns at 6 and 12 hpi, suggesting that DDX1 and DDX3 are more likely to serve compensatory functions in VEEV multiplication. Although the decrease in infectious viral titers observed at 24 hpi was with the double knockdown was statistically significant, it was not greater than the individual knockdowns. In addition, intracellular capsid protein expression in the siRNA studies was assessed under the same experimental conditions as Fig. 4C. Western blot analysis indicated that in comparison to the respective controls, at 12 hpi and 24 hpi capsid protein expression was reduced with DDX1/3 siRNA (Fig. 4D). In addition, intracellular and extracellular viral RNA was quantified by q-RT-PCR. DDX1 or DDX3 depleted U87MG cells infected with rTC-83 were processed for q-RT-PCR at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Fig. 4E indicated that at 6 and 24 hpi a 1log decrease in intracellular viral RNA replication was observed when compared to the rTC-83 controls, whereas at 12 hpi a 2log decrease was observed. Fig. 4F indicated that extracellular viral RNA was decreased by 2logs at 12 and 24 hpi, however, no significant decrease (30%) was observed at 6 hpi when compared to the rTC-83 controls. This observation leads us to speculate that the dependence on host RNA helicases may be more prominent in the context of these infected cells, at the later time points during infection when iterative rounds of viral multiplication have occurred in the infected cells. This may also be related to the relative abundance of viral multiplication in the cells that may impose additive demands on the host machinery to support a productive viral infection. To determine if DDX1 and DDX3 double knockdown extended to TrD, supernatants collected at 24 hpi from infected U87MG cells transfected with control or DDX1/3 siRNAs were analyzed by plaque assay for infectious virions. Fig. 4G demonstrated a \u223c1log decrease with DDX1/3 siRNA when compared to the control. Taken together this data reiterates that TC-83 is likely to utilize DDX1 and DDX3 for viral multiplication.",

Old world alphaviruses SFV (Panas et al., 2012), SINV and CHIKV (Fros et al., 2012) have been shown to induce SG formation in G3BP1 foci early in infected cells and interact with G3BPs (Fros et al., 2012, Panas et al., 2012, Scholte et al., 2015). In particular SFV-nsP3 recruits G3BP and disassembles SGs (Scholte et al., 2015).

Of note, in our MS analysis, we also identified PABP as interacting with nsP3; however PABP fell below our condition of 50% reproducibility and therefore excluded from Fig. 2A. We hypothesized that the interaction of DDX3 with nsP3 may play a role in facilitating the recruitment of the eIF machinery to potentially aid in translation of viral proteins. Therefore, we asked, does VEEV-nsP3 associate with any of the eIFs that are known to interact with DDX3? To address this we proposed the following working model (Fig. 5\nA). During VEEV infection, a global inhibition of cellular transcription and translation occurs (Akhrymuk et al., 2012), resulting in accumulation of pre-existing DDX3-eIF4A-eIF4G-PABP complexes. We propose that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with DDX3 along with its pre-existing partners to initiate translation of viral mRNA. To address the validity of this model, U87MG cells infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:20) were collected at 6 hpi, lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation. The subsequent western blot was probed with antibodies to HA, eIF4A, eIF4G, PABP and DDX3. Fig. 5B illustrates that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with the host translational factors; eIF4A, eIF4G and PABP; together with DDX3 thus supporting our proposed working model. Taken together, this data puts forth the suggestion that VEEV-nsP3 may co-opt the host translational machinery from SGs to initiate translation of viral proteins in infected cells.",

We asked if inhibiting DDX3 helicase activity would have an effect on the interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and the identified host translational components. We initially determined by cell viability assays the highest non-toxic concentration of RK-33 (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 6\nA). Next we determined if RK-33 interfered with viral RNA replication kinetics over a time course. Plaque assay analyses indicated that at 8 and 16 hpi a 1log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the DMSO controls (Fig. 6B). However, at 4 hpi no observable difference occurred in the RK-33 treated cells whereas at 24 hpi a 50% reduction in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the DMSO control. Hence, we opted for a 6 hpi time point to determine if inhibition of DDX3 helicase activity interfered with the interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and the host translational components, as the inhibitor treatment at this time point would not interfere with viral replication kinetics. Western blot analysis indicated a decrease in interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and eIF4G, eIF4A and PABP (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 5 and 7). This decrease was not due to reduced levels of VEEV-nsP3. Densitometric counts indicated that VEEV-nsP3 interactions with eIF4G, eIF4A and PABP were reduced by 54%, 86% and 44% respectively. This data indicates that DDX3 helicase activity may be necessary for VEEV-nsP3 interactions with host translational machinery to potentially facilitate viral translation.",

The introduction of an HA tag at the C-terminal end of rTC-83 (rTC-83-nsP3-HA) did not significantly impede viral replication kinetics (Fig. 1) and could therefore be utilized as a tool to characterize the VEEV-nsP3 interactome. We identified and validated RNA helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 as interacting partners of VEEV-nsP3 (Fig. 2). DDX1 and DDX3 were found to have an effect on rTC-83 multiplication (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Although we observed a similar decrease in TrD multiplication when compared to rTC-83, the extent of inhibition differed by a log, which may speak to the difference in virulence between the two strains. The U87MG glioblastoma cell model is an attractive system to study host-based candidates for development of therapeutics against alphavirus infections. Additional studies with primary brain cells will enable us to further our understanding of the magnitude of relevance of DDX1 and DDX3 to new world alphavirus infections.",

To that effect, we have observed that the dependence of the virulent TrD strain on DDX3 is lesser than that of TC-83 (Fig. 4), which may also attest to the dependence on host helicases as a reflection of viral virulence.",

This suggests that RNA helicases may serve redundant roles in the viral life cycle or may be utilized at different time points in the viral life cycle to serve different roles. On that note, it is important to bear in mind that during the course of infection, different pools of VEEV-nsP3 may be present that interact with a selected subset of host proteins, which may speak to VEEV-nsP3 interacting with DDX1 and DDX3 at different times during infection to serve different roles in the viral life cycle. This may offer a plausible explanation to the additive effect of the double knockdown scenario where a decrease in infectious viral titers was greater than that observed with the individual knockdowns at the earlier time points of infection (Fig. 3, Fig. 4C); however, at 24 hpi similar levels of infectious viral titers were detected between the individual and combinatorial knockdowns.

In the case of HIV-1, DDX1 and DDX3 are critical co-factors that interact with HIV-1 Tat and Rev to promote HIV-1 mRNA translation and transition to late-stage HIV-1 infection (Lai et al., 2013). A recent study demonstrated that DDX3 interacted with influenza virus NS1 and NP proteins, and localized to virus induced SGs (Thulasi Raman et al., 2016). Furthermore, that study indicated that DDX3 is capable of nucleating stress granule formation, and that the core helicase domain of DDX3 was sufficient for its localization to SGs (Thulasi Raman et al., 2016). This offers further support to the loss of interactions we observed between VEEV-nsP3 and the host translational machinery with treatment of RK-33. Alternatively, VEEV-nsP3 could usurp these host factors to disassemble the SGs to create an environment suitable for efficient viral multiplication. A similar subversion of SGs is necessary for establishment of a successful influenza infection, as knockdown of DDX3 impaired stress granule formation and increased viral titers (Thulasi Raman et al., 2016). The effect of VEEV-nsP3 interactions with host translational machinery on viral translation are future avenues being explored by our laboratory.",

            "text": "The applicability of DEAD box proteins as candidates for therapeutic intervention has primarily been researched in the field of cancer biology. DDX3 levels have been observed to be significantly elevated in a number of human sarcoma subtypes (Wilky et al., 2015). Treatment with the small molecule inhibitor RK-33 was found to be preferentially cytotoxic to sarcoma cells, including chemotherapy resistant cells, but spared non-malignant cells (Wilky et al., 2015). It was also reported that 39% of all colorectal tumors overexpressed DDX3 (Heerma van Voss et al., 2015). Knockdown of DDX3 function in colorectal tumors with RK-33 was reported to cause G1 cell cycle arrest, reduced tumor proliferation, inhibited Wnt signaling, and promoted tumor death (Heerma van Voss et al., 2015). In the context of viral infections, a number of studies have suggested the DEAD box proteins DDX1 and DDX3 as promising therapeutic targets for treatment of HIV-1 infection, but such experiments have not yet been completed (Fang et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2013). In addition to the reported role in influenza SG formation, DDX3 was also implicated in the formation of SGs in HCV infections, which redistribute and co-localize with HCV core protein around lipid droplets to facilitate viral budding. It was shown that silencing of DDX3 and other stress granule components significantly inhibits HCV infection (P\u00e8ne et al., 2015). Therefore, it is of interest to apply the strategies employed by cancer researchers to the treatment of acute viral infections such as HIV-1, HCV, and VEEV.",

Our data have demonstrated that VEEV-nsP3 associates with DDX1 and DDX3 in infected cells to facilitate viral multiplication. As a putative mechanism for these interactions, we determined that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with a pre-formed translational complex, comprising of DDX3:eIF4A:eIF4G:PABP to potentially aid in translation of viral proteins. Novel components of the nsP3 interactome in infected cells can, therefore, pave the way for novel therapeutic intervention strategies.",

Using the rTC-83 clone as a backbone and standard PCR recombination techniques, an HA tag was inserted at the C-terminus of nsP3 to allow for detection and isolation of nsP3-containing complexes. Briefly, the nsP3 region of rTC-83 was sub-cloned with primers containing a linker region (Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala) and an HA-tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of nsP3.
