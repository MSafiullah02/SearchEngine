The most common viruses implicated in foodborne disease are enteric viruses, which are found inthe human gastrointestinal tract, excreted in human feces and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Many different viruses are found in the gastrointestinal tract but not all are recognized as foodborne pathogens. The diseases caused by enteric viruses fall into three main types: gastroenteritis, enterically transmitted hepatitis, and illnesses that can affect other parts of the body such as the eye, the respiratory system and the central nervous system leading to conjunctivitis, poliomyelitis, meningitis and encephalitis. Viral pathogens excreted in human feces include noroviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotaviruses, and astroviruses. Most of these viruses have been associated with foodborne disease outbreaks. Noroviruses and HAV are commonly identified as foodborne causes of gastroenteritis and acute hepatitis, respectively.",

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified norovirus (NoV) and HAV as the major foodborne viruses of public health significance. The HEV was also included because of its high prevalence in pigs and the potential for zoonotic transmission (EFSA 2011).

            "text": "All enteric viruses except the adenoviruses contain RNA, have a protein capsid that protects the nucleic acid, and are non-enveloped. In the environment and in food, the enteric viruses are inert particles and do not replicate or metabolize because, like all other viruses, they are obligate pathogens and require living cells to multiply. Cell cultures are generally used for the growth and analysis of culturable viruses. Using culture methods, infectious viruses can be identified through their ability to produce cell changes or cytopathic effects (CPE), or through expression of viral antigens that may be detected serologically. The advantage of culture-based methodology is that it can be either quantitative or qualitative and produces unambiguous results with respect to virus presence and infectivity. Many of the enteric viruses such as astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, HAV and rotaviruses are fastidious in their in vitro growth requirements but can still be grown in cell cultures with some effort. Despite numerous attempts to grow human norovirus (HuNoV) in vitro in traditional cell lines, primary cell cultures, or differentiated tissues grown in three-dimensional cultures (Duizer et al. 2004; Lay et al. 2010; Papafragkou et al. 2013), they have until recently remained recalitrant. Low-level HuNoV infection in cultured B-cells was recently reported (Jones et al. 2014). Such findings are exciting and promising, but the model awaits optimization and validation before it can be routinely applied. In addition, no animal model for Human NoV infection has been validated, although recent reports on replication of this virus in immunocompromised mice and gnotobiotic animals suggest that this task is not out of reach (Tan and Jiang 2010; Bok et al. 2011). In the meantime, surrogate viruses that are closely related to HuNoV and are easily cultured in the laboratory, are used to conduct studies on the disinfection and environmental persistence of HuNoV.",

The SPIEM is more sensitive than direct EM because, in the presence of specific antibodies, the virus particles are aggregated together making them more easily distinguishable from the background matrix. Many of the \u2018small round viruses\u2019, which include astroviruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses and parvoviruses, were first discovered through the use of EM. Molecular methods, especially real-time quantitative PCR, are now the most commonly used techniques for the identification of enteric viruses in foods. Other methods for identification of enteric viruses in human specimens include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and culture-PCR, which is a combination of cell culture and PCR methods. The latter technique detects only the infectious virus and is preferable to direct PCR, which currently detects both infectious and non-infectious viruses.",

Most resist freezing and drying and are stable in the presence of organic solvents. It is not clear whether pasteurization at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min inactivates all enteric viruses in all food types. Many enteric viruses show resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, which is now widely used as a food processing treatment for shellfish, jams, jellies and dairy products (Kingsley 2013). The resistance of enteric viruses to environmental stressors allows them to survive both the acidic environment of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and also the proteolytic and alkaline activities of the duodenum, so that infection can be established in the small intestine. Thus, enteric viruses can survive in acidic foods, marinated and pickled foods, frozen foods and lightly cooked foods such as gently steamed shellfish. Most enteric viruses are believed to have a low infectious dose of 10\u2013100 particles or possibly even less. Hence, although they do not multiply in food, enough infectious viruses may survive in food to cause infection.",

Shellfish filter between four and 20 L of water every hour, sieving out and accumulating food particles, including bacteria, viruses and heavy metals. Feeding rates depend upon water temperature and salinity and availability of food and particulate matter. Bacteria and viruses become trapped in the mucus of the gills, which is then pushed into the digestive gland where viruses concentrate. Shellfish can accumulate high concentrations of viruses within a few hours e.g., they may contain virus levels that are 100\u20131000 times greater than in the surrounding waters.",

In winter, the shellfish are physiologically less active and do not accumulate viruses as fast as in warmer seasons. In clean waters, shellfish depurate or cleanse themselves of bacteria and particulate matter. However, studies have shown that depuration does not remove viruses efficiently and that there is no correlation between the removal of bacteria and viruses (Lees 2000). This was demonstrated in a large hepatitis A outbreak in Australia where oysters were depurated for 36 h before consumption but still retained infectious HAV (Conaty et al. 2000). Recent laboratory-based depuration experiments have shown that poliovirus, HAV and norovirus are eliminated at different rates from Pacific oysters over a 48 h period; most of the poliovirus was inactivated but HAV remained infectious over the 48 h period (McLeod et al. 2009). Human noroviruses are particularly recalcitrant to removal by depuration due to specific carbohydrate moieties expressed in the digestive diverticula of some filter-feeding bivalves that bind and retain the viruses (Le Guyader 2006; Maalouf et al. 2010; Tian et al. 2007).",

Although it is presumed that fresh produce is \u201cclean, green and healthy\u201d, it may not be so, especially when it is imported from countries where general hygiene practices do not meet international standards. In recent years, there have been numerous outbreaks of HuNoV and HAV associated with contaminated fresh produce imported into Europe, Australia and North America (Anonymous 2013; Carvalho et al. 2012; Cotterelle et al. 2005; Donnan et al. 2012; Ethelberg et al. 2010; Falkenhorst et al. 2005; Fournet et al. 2012; Korsager et al. 2005; Le Guyader et al. 2004; Made et al. 2013; Maunula et al. 2009). Confirming the sources of contamination during these outbreaks has proven to be very difficult. In some cases, more than one pathogen or strain of virus was associated with the outbreak, suggesting that sewage-impacted irrigation or produce-wash water may have been involved.",

Foods that are subject to much handling and are subsequently consumed cold or uncooked are at risk of contamination from food handlers. Such foods include bread and bakery goods, lightly cooked or raw shellfish, sandwiches, salads, herbs, fresh fruits, cold meats and cold desserts. It is probable that the current trend for the consumption of raw or lightly cooked ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, especially salads and sandwiches, has increased the risk of foodborne viral disease.

Immunofluorescence is often used for detection of HAV antigen in infected cells because of the lack of CPE. The virus is usually slow-growing and the yield in cell cultures is low compared to most other picornaviruses. Consequently it is difficult to identify the virus in clinical, food or environmental sources by culture alone. Under normal conditions, the virus requires 3 weeks for in vitro growth. Laboratory-adapted strains such as HM 175 are able to produce CPE and have been used extensively in research studies. These strains require less time for in vitro growth and produce visible CPE or plaques. Molecular techniques, including culture-PCR, have become the method of choice for detection of HAV in non-human samples. In humans, clinical diagnosis is usually based on the patient\u2019s immune response.

The virus exhibits greater thermal stability at high temperatures when compared to norovirus surrogates. The resistance of HAV to heat is greater in foods and shellfish due to reduced heat transfer and protection by the shellfish tissue. Under refrigeration and freezing conditions the virus remains intact and infectious for several years. It is also resistant to drying, remaining infectious for over 1 month at 25 \u00b0C and 42 % humidity, and shows even greater resistance at low humidity and low temperatures. The survival of HAV on fresh and semi-dried tomato (SDT) surfaces was investigated following a recent outbreak of HAV. Results showed that inactivation of HAV on SDT using chemicals or heat was difficult and that it was important to inactivate HAV prior to or during the manufacture of SDT because, following manufacture, any HAV remaining on SDT could retain infectivity at both room temperature and at 5 \u00b0C for periods beyond the shelf life of the product (Greening and Hewitt 2012).",

In addition, HAV was not inactivated by 300 mg/L perchloroacetic acid or 1 g/L chloramine at 20 \u00b0C for 15 min (Hollinger and Emerson 2007) although it was susceptible to formalin (3 % for 5 min or 8 % for 1 min at 25 \u00b0C), iodine (3 mg/L for 5 min) and \u00df-propiolactone (0.03 % for 72 h at 4 \u00b0C) (Hollinger and Emerson 2007). The virus is stable at pH 1.0 and survives acid marination at pH 3.75 in mussels for at least 4 weeks (Hewitt and Greening 2004; Hollinger and Emerson 2007). Gamma irradiation is not effective for inactivation of HAV on fresh fruits and vegetables and high doses of ultraviolet radiation are required for inactivation (Hollinger and Emerson 2007). Hydrostatic pressure, now used as an isothermal preservation method for perishable foods, inactivated HAV following 5 min exposure at 400 MPa (Kingsley 2013). Free chlorine concentrations of less than 10 ppm inactivate HAV at room temperature when sufficient exposure times are provided (5\u201315 min) and organic solids contribute minimally to chlorine demand (Hollinger and Emerson 2007). Like many enteric viruses, fecal material and virus aggregation provide protection to HAV against chemical and physical assaults. Overall HAV exhibits greater resistance to stressors than other picornaviruses.",

The disease has an incubation period of 2\u20136 weeks with an average of 28 days. Initially the symptoms are non-specific and include fever, headache, fatigue, anorexia, dark urine, light stools, and nausea and vomiting with occasional diarrhea. One to two weeks later, characteristic symptoms of hepatitis such as viremia and jaundice appear. Peak infectivity occurs in 2 weeks preceding the onset of jaundice and the virus is present in the blood at 2\u20134 weeks. The virus is shed in large numbers (>106 particles/g) in feces from the latter 2 weeks of the incubation period and for up to 5 weeks.

Because the onset of symptoms occurs several weeks after infection, it is rare to have the suspected food available for analysis. A killed vaccine that provides long-lasting immunity has been commercially available since 1995 and is commonly given to travelers at high risk. It is now a part of the childhood vaccination schedule in the US, as recommended by the CDC.

Other shellfish-associated outbreaks include oysters in Australia (Conaty et al. 2000), oysters in Brazil (Coelho et al. 2003), mussels in Italy (Croci et al. 2000) and clams in Spain (Bosch et al. 2001).

In fact, HEV is now regarded as a significant emerging zoonotic and potential foodborne pathogen by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2011). Seroprevalence rates of 16\u201329 %, and as high as 52 % in a hyperendemic region of Southern France, have been reported among adults in Europe.

The HEV is 27\u201334 nm, non-enveloped virus with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (linear genome of 7.2 kb) (Table 2.1). The capsid symmetry is icosohedral and the buoyant density in potassium tartrate\u2014glycerol gradient is 1.29 g/ml. Virus particles isolated from serum associate with lipids and therefore have a lower density (1.15\u20131.16 g/ml) in sucrose fractions than do HEV isolated from feces (1.27\u20131.28 g/ml) (Kamar et al. 2012). The HEV was originally classified in the Caliciviridae family because of similarities in structural morphology and genome organization but was later reclassified under Togaviridae because of similarities between the replicative enzymes of HEV and the togaviruses. Until very recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification placed HEV under a new family Hepeviridae under the single genus Hepevirus (Van Regenmortel 2000). The family has since been divided into two genera; Orthohepevirus, which infects mammalian and avian species and Piscihepevirus, which includes only the cutthroat trout virus (Smith et al. 2014). While there are four groups of orthohepevirus (groups A-D), only group A is known to infect humans (Smith et al. 2014). Within group A, there are four HEV genotypes (HEV1-HEV4) that infect humans and other mammals but only a single serotype (Dalton et al. 2013).",

Both HEV3 and HEV4 strains have been detected in retail pork products (Berto et al. 2013; Berto et al. 2012; Colson et al. 2010) and epidemiological investigations strongly point to human infections caused by consumption of pork products and game meat (Li et al. 2005; Masuda et al. 2005; Matsubayashi et al. 2008; Matsuda et al. 2003) and deer (Mushahwar 2008; Takahashi et al. 2003; Tei et al. 2003). Other mammals such as rats, bats, rabbits and ferrets are known to harbor HEV, but no cases of human disease have been associated with these animals. Contamination of water, shellfish and fresh produce with HEV has also been documented, suggesting the occurrence of non-zoonotic sources of foodborne infections and/or water and crop contamination with swine or other animal waste (Meng 2011). Blood transfusions and organ transplants are another significant source of HEV infection in the developed world (Mushahwar 2008). Secondary person-to-person transmission is relatively uncommon and is estimated at 0.7\u20138.0 % (Cromeans et al. 2001).",

Clinical (icteric) infections are generally mild and self-limiting, lasting 4\u20136 weeks unless an underlying chronic liver disease is present. Excess fatalities among pregnant women have not been reported for HEV3 or HEV4 (Dalton et al. 2013). Symptomatic infection is reported to be 3 times more common in middle-aged and elderly men than women, even though seroprevalence rates in men and women are similar. Reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, but are probably linked to excessive alcohol consumption among a cohort of this population. Chronic infection occurs primarily among immunosuppressed patients, particularly solid organ transplant recipients. It is estimated that HEV prevalence among transplant patients is 1.0\u20132.3 % and although infection is usually asymptomatic, approximately 10 % of exposed patients develop cirrhosis within 2 years. Infrequently, neurological disorders, encephalitis and muscular impairments (including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have resulted from acute and chronic infection with HEV3 and possibly also HEV1. Viremia and virus excretion in feces through bile begins 2 weeks before the peak elevation of liver enzymes (and symptoms, if present) and continues until the enzyme levels return to normal (up to 2\u20133 weeks after symptoms appear). Diagnosis is generally by detection of IgM and IgG in patients\u2019 sera or by molecular detection of the virus in feces or sera. A recombinant vaccine was licensed in China in 2012 but has not yet received WHO recommendation (Dalton et al. 2013).",

Similarly, fecal contamination of run-off waters from pig farms or from lands spread with untreated pig manure could contaminate irrigation and surface waters with subsequent HEV contamination of fruits, vegetables and shellfish. The virus has been detected in raw sewage, river water, shellfish and seawater in Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, UK and the U.S. (Clemente-Casares et al. 2003; Crossan et al. 2012; Ishida et al. 2012; Jothikumar et al. 1993; Masclaux et al. 2013; Pina et al. 2000; Pina et al. 1998; Williamson et al. 2011). Therefore, consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish is a risk factor for HEV infection and has been implicated as the source of sporadic cases occurring in Europe and Southeast Asia (Cacopardo et al. 1997; Koizumi et al. 2004). In addition, HEV has been detected on strawberries irrigated with river water under experimental conditions (Brassard et al. 2012), providing evidence for HEV contamination through irrigation water. In a study where enteric viruses were traced through a food production chain, 1 of 38 samples of frozen raspberry tested positive for HEV, but the source (water or human/animal contact) of viral contamination could not be definitively identified (Maunula et al. 2013).",

Human HEV3 and HEV4 strains can easily infect pigs under experimental conditions indicating a zoonotic origin for these viruses, a property not shared by human HEV1 and HEV2 strains (Meng 2011). The virus replicates in the liver and intestine and is shed in the feces and bile of swine for 3\u20135 weeks following infection (Halbur et al. 2001). It is highly contagious and therefore can spread among herds of domestic pigs very efficiently (Dalton et al. 2013). Swine veterinarians and handlers are significantly more likely to be seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies (Meng 2011), a finding consistent with HEV transmission through contact or environmental exposure.",

In Japan, 2 % of commercial pig livers were HEV positive and the strains were closely related to those detected in HEV-infected humans (Yazaki et al. 2003). Consumption of raw or undercooked pig and wild boar livers was a risk factor for several sporadic HEV illnesses recently reported in southeast Asia and Europe (Colson et al. 2010; Li et al. 2005; Masuda et al. 2005; Matsubayashi et al. 2008; Matsuda et al. 2003).

The prototype norovirus, the Norwalk virus, was first discovered by Kapikian et al. (1972) following an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio (Kapikian et al. 1972). Immune electron microscopy was used to examine feces from volunteers who consumed fecal filtrates from infected cases (Dolin et al. 1971; Kapikian et al. 1972). At that time, most cases of gastroenteritis that could not be attributed to a bacterial agent were termed as acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis of unknown etiology. The discovery of Norwalk virus provided the first evidence of a viral etiology for human diarrheal disease. Despite this discovery, noroviruses remained largely unrecognized until about 20 years ago because their detection was technically difficult and because the illness was generally thought to be mild and short-lived and so was frequently not reported to public health authorities.",

Outbreaks commonly occur in closed community situations such as rest homes, schools, camps, hospitals, resorts and cruise ships where many high-touch surfaces and food and water sources are shared. Since norovirus infections are often not notifiable, the global burden of disease is not known and is generally grossly under-reported particularly in developing countries. However, some of the disease burden is recorded in many developed countries through the notification of gastroenteritis outbreaks to the public health disease surveillance systems. Human noroviruses cause ~90 % of all outbreaks of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and ~50 % of all-cause outbreaks worldwide (Patel et al. 2009). The National Outbreak Reporting system (NORs), launched in 2009 by the CDC in the United States, determined that norovirus was responsible or suspected in 89 % of all outbreaks of gastroenteritis with a known etiology (Wikswo and Hall 2012).",

The buoyant density in cesium chloride gradient is 1.36\u20131.41 g/ml. The genome is composed of three open reading frames (ORF), which code for the non-structural proteins, including the RNA polymerase in ORF1, the major capsid protein (VP1) in ORF2 and a minor structural protein (VP2) in ORF3. Currently, six norovirus genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV and GVI) have been identified. The majority of human infections are caused by genogroup I and II (GI & GII) strains but infections with GIV strains are sometimes reported. Genogroups I and II contain 9 (GI.1-9) and 22 genotypes (GII.1-22), respectively (Kroneman et al. 2013) (Fig. 2.2). Genogroup II includes three genotypes (GII.11, GII.18 and GII.19) that cause asymptomatic infection in swine. Two genotypes of genogroup III (GIII.1-2) are known to cause diarrhea in bovine calves. Genogroup IV noroviruses have been detected in humans (GIV.1), dogs, lions and cats (animal strains belong to GIV.2) (Martella et al. 2007; Martella et al. 2008b; Pinto et al. 2012). Genogroup V noroviruses are highly prevalent in laboratory mice but are not known to infect other animals (Wobus et al. 2006). The most recently established genogroup VI viruses infect canine species (Green 2013). An international norovirus working group established in 2008 recently published new parameters for norovirus genotyping and proposed a standard nomenclature for reporting purposes (Kroneman et al. 2013). In addition, an online typing tool (http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/norovirus/typingtool) is now available for public use.\n",

However, recently Jones et al. (2014) reported low-level HuNoV infection in cultured B-cells which could be enhanced by co-inoculation with bacteria expressing specific carbohydrate molecules known as histo-blood group antigens (Jones et al. 2014). While an exciting breakthrough, further optimization is needed to increase its robustness and applicability in food virology laboratories. Permissive cell lines have been identified that are capable of producing genome-packaged, intact virus particles after transfection of virus-derived genomic RNA, but viruses were not capable of infecting new cells, even after over-expression of the putative cellular receptors for HuNoVs (Guix et al. 2007). Replication of HuNoVs in laboratory animals has been described in gnotobiotic pigs and calves and non-human primates (Bok et al. 2011; Tan and Jiang 2010), but such animals are not well suited for routine laboratory studies. Evidence of HuNoV replication in the systemic tissue of immunocompromised laboratory mice was recently reported (Taube et al. 2013), suggesting the possibility for a mouse model for human norovirus gastroenteritis in the near future. Several animal caliciviruses, including a murine norovirus (MNV), can be grown in routine laboratory cultures. Animal models in gnotobiotic pigs and calves have also been described (Tan and Jiang 2010). Much information regarding the basic virology and pathogenesis of noroviruses can be inferred from these models, but many questions remain unanswered.",

Studies using human volunteers showed that norovirus retains infectivity when heated to 60 \u00b0C for 30 min and therefore is not inactivated by pasteurization treatment although studies with infectious norovirus surrogates indicate pasteurization temperatures are sufficient for inactivation (Bozkurt et al. 2013; Cannon et al. 2006). The virus also retains infectivity following exposure to pH 2.7 for 3 h at room temperature (Dolin et al. 1972; Dolin et al. 1971; Green 2007). Further evidence of its resistance to low pH was shown when norovirus was exposed to heat treatment and subsequent marination at pH 3.75 in mussels for 1 month; no decrease in norovirus titer was observed by real-time RT-PCR (Hewitt and Greening 2004). There are anecdotal reports of people developing gastroenteritis after eating pickled shellfish. Norovirus, like other enteric viruses, remains infectious under refrigeration and freezing conditions, appears to survive well in the environment, and is resistant to drying. This was demonstrated when carpet layers became ill after lifting carpet that had become contaminated 12 days earlier in a retirement home outbreak (Chadwick et al. 2000). In a recent study, HuNoV remained infectious in groundwater for at least 61 days (last collection point for human challenge study) and viral RNA could be detected 3 years after inoculation (Seitz et al. 2011).",

It is probable that noroviruses persist in these environments for extended periods (weeks or months). In infected live oysters, noroviruses were still detectable after 4\u20136 weeks in natural growing conditions (Greening et al. 2003). Fecal material associated with these viruses and their propensity to aggregate causes them to be more moderately resistant to chemical disinfectants, including free chlorine levels used in drinking water distribution systems. Noroviruses also retain at least partial infectivity after exposure to 20 % ether at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h (Dolin et al. 1972; Green 2007). It should be noted, however, that virus titer could not accurately be determined in the early human challenge experiments reviewed in Green (2007). If starting virus titers are high (i.e. \u22658 log per ml), incomplete virus inactivation may be observed even if a disinfectant produces 3\u20134 log10 reduction in the titers of infectious virus.",

These widely used criteria are: stools negative for bacterial pathogens, a mean or median duration of illness of 12\u201360 h, vomiting in \u226550 % of cases and a mean or median incubation period of 24\u201348 h. The mechanism of immunity to norovirus infection is not clear. Infection normally stimulates production of both gut and serum antibody and although immunity to the infecting norovirus strain may develop, it is generally short-lived, is strain-specific and does not confer protection against future infection. Re-infection with a different strain can occur soon after the initial infection. Thus, given the genetic variability of noroviruses, people are likely to be re-infected many times during their lifetimes.",

Persons deemed to be \u201csecretors\u201d are capable of expressing HBGAs on their gastrointestinal cells and secretions, including saliva. Noroviruses are capable of binding to HBGAs and saliva from secretors and the role of HBGAs as receptors or co-receptors for virus attachment and entry into cells has been speculated. Evidence for this was derived from human challenge studies with Norwalk virus (GI.1 prototype) where \u201cnon-secretors\u201d, individuals that do not express HBGAs on their GI mucosa, were resistant to symptomatic infection (Atmar et al. 2011; Hutson et al. 2002; Lindesmith et al. 2003; Tan and Jiang 2010). There also appears to be an association with HBGA expression and susceptibility to infection with GII.4 noroviruses (Frenck et al. 2012; Tan and Jiang 2010); although, this association is not as well defined as it is for Norwalk virus. There is also evidence that susceptibility to infection by other norovirus genotypes may not depend on the secretor status (Lindesmith et al. 2005). Considering the genetic diversity of noroviruses, this unfortunately means that there is likely a genotype capable of infecting almost everyone, regardless of their HBGA expression.",

Of the 886 outbreaks where the factors leading to food contamination were indicated, 82 % of outbreaks involved food handler contact and 13 % indicated contamination of the raw product (Hall et al. 2012). Determination of the original source of virus is often problematic because several modes of transmission frequently operate during norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks. Although the initial transmission route may be through consumption of contaminated foods, secondary transmission via direct contamination of the environment or person-to-person contact also often occurs. This results in wide dissemination where infection quickly spreads through institutions, schools, camps and resorts and cruise ships leading to large-scale epidemics, often with over 50 % attack rates.",

The comparison of norovirus sequences from fecal specimens and contaminated foods, such as oysters, can often indicate if it is a common source outbreak or if individual cases are somehow related, particularly when a strain is involved that is not common in the community. In 1993, 23 gastroenteritis outbreaks across six states in the United States were shown to be related to consumption of oysters harvested from a single area and contaminated with the same norovirus strain (Dowell et al. 1995). Validating the source of outbreaks caused by GII.4 strains is often more difficult because these strains can be highly prevalent in the community, particularly during pandemic years. Sequencing either the full capsid- encodingORF2 or minimally the hypervariable region of ORF2 is needed for molecular epidemiologic investigations of these strains.",

Despite the presence of GII norovirus strains in swine populations (0.2\u201325 % detection rate) globally, there is no evidence of human infection by these strains (Mathijs et al. 2012). Similarly, GIII bovine noroviruses have been detected in the stools of diarrheic calves with a 1.6\u201372 % detection rate (Mathijs et al. 2012). Despite serologic evidence of large animal veterinarians\u2019 exposure to bovine noroviruses (Widdowson et al. 2005), no illnesses have been reported. GIV.1 noroviruses appear to infect only humans and animal strains of GIV norovirus have not been detected in humans. Recombination between strains within the same host species has been reported for human, bovine, canine and mouse noroviruses; however, recombination between strains of different host species has not been confirmed. In the laboratory, HuNoV infection in gnotobiotic pigs and calves (Cheetham et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2008; Takanashi et al. 2011) and non-human primates (Bok et al. 2011; Rockx et al. 2005) has been extensively studied as models for viral pathogenesis, immunology and response to vaccination (Tan and Jiang 2010). Only two reports to date provide evidence of animals as reservoirs for human noroviruses. In one study, human norovirus-like sequences were detected in the feces of livestock (cows and pigs) (Mattison et al. 2007). Human norovirus RNA was also detected in the feces of pet dogs from households where symptoms of gastroenteritis were reported, suggesting a potential role for dogs in HuNoV transmission (Summa et al. 2012). However, based on current evidence it seems more likely that dogs are the recipients of spill-over from the human population rather than being a reservoir.",

            "text": "The sapoviruses, formerly described as the \u201cSapporo-like viruses\u201d or SLVs, also belong to the Caliciviridae family and cause gastroenteritis among both children and adults. Sapoviruses were first identified in 1977 after a gastroenteritis outbreak in a children\u2019s home in Sapporo, Japan. Sapoviruses were oncethought to be primarily associated with pediatric diarrhea in infants since infections among adults were less frequently reported and were less severe than those caused by HuNoVs (Hansman et al. 2007a). Diagnostic testing for sapovirus is, therefore, infrequently performed during routine outbreak investigations or after emergency room visits. However, outbreaks of sapovirus gastroenteritis among adults and elderly persons are increasingly reported worldwide (Pang et al. 2009; Svraka et al. 2010). In addition, the emergence of specific sapovirus strains (GI.2 and GIV) has correlated with its increased occurrence (Gallimore et al. 2006; Khamrin et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2012; Svraka et al. 2010). Sapovirus infections occur throughout the year, but the frequency is higher during the winter and spring months. Person-to-person transmission is believed to be the most common route, although several foodborne outbreaks have been reported (Hansman et al. 2007b; Iizuka et al. 2010; Kobayashi et al. 2012; Nakagawa-Okamoto et al. 2009; Noel et al. 1997; Ueki et al. 2010; Yamashita et al. 2010).",

Based on the nucleic acid sequence of the major capsid protein (VP1), human sapoviruses are further divided into at least seven GI and GII genotypes, one GIV genotype and two genotypes of GV (Oka et al. 2012; Oka et al. 2015). GV genotypes also have been detected in pigs and sea lions (Oka et al. 2015). Of the additional proposed genogroups, three infect swine (GVI, GVII and GVIII) (Scheuer et al. 2013).

Its culture depends on supplementation of media with glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), a bile acid (Chang 2004).

In fact, the clinical symptoms, virus shedding, and epidemiological features (incubation period, duration of illness) of epidemic sapovirus are nearly identical to those of noroviruses. It is hypothesized that using the Kaplan criteria alone for diagnosis of outbreaks may result in an overestimation of norovirus and an underestimation of sapovirus (Lee et al. 2012). Severe gastrointestinal illnesses and even deaths due to sapovirus do occur, but are infrequently reported. In a recent study, norovirus- and rotavirus- negative clinical specimens collected from children seeking medical attention for acute gastroenteritis were screened for less common agents of viral gastroenteritis; 5.4 % were positive for sapoviruses (Chhabra et al. 2013). However, determining sapovirus as the causative agent of gastroenteritis is sometimes difficult, particularly for sporadic cases, due to the common presence of other gastroenteritis-causing viruses in fecal specimens and high rates of asymptomatic carriage. In one study, 4.2 % of the healthy control specimens tested positive for sapovirus and mixed infections with rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus and adenovirus were reported (Chhabra et al. 2013). High levels of sapovirus shedding (106\u20131011 per g) in stools from both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons have been reported (Yoshida et al. 2009). While the infectious dose is not known, it is thought to be low and similar to that for noroviruses.",

Although the animal and human strains are usually distinct, some human strains are closely related to animal strains and cross-species infections do occur (Sattar and Tetro 2001). Rotaviruses can be excreted in human stool at concentrations of up to 1012 virus particles per g of feces, making them highly transmissible through direct person-to-person contact and by contaminated fomites (Bishop 1996). Transmission of rotavirus via aerosolized droplets following a vomiting event has not been confirmed. As few as ten virus particles appear to be sufficient for causing infection in humans (Graham et al. 1987). Infection is generally not recognized as being foodborne but outbreaks associated with food and water have been reported from a number of countries (Sattar and Tetro 2001).",

Rotaviruses belong to the Sedoreovirinae subfamily. Electron micrographs of rotaviruses show a characteristic wheel-like appearance, hence the name \u2018rotavirus\u2019, derived from the Latin meaning \u2018wheel\u2019 (Fig. 2.1b). These viruses are distinct in that they have a complex, segmented genome that undergoes reassortment during replication. There are eight groups (also termed species) within the Rotavirus genus, designated A-H (Desselberger 2014). Group A rotaviruses are most commonly associated with human disease; infection with Groups B and C is rarely reported. Group A rotaviruses are also common agents of disease in cattle and several other domestic animal species (equine, porcine, ovine, caprine, canine, feline (rare), and poultry (rare)) (Dhama et al. 2009). In addition, Groups C and E rotaviruses infect swine; Groups D, F and G affect poultry; and Group B viruses have been detected in young cattle, swine and sheep, although rarely (Dhama et al. 2009). Initially isolated from humans but unassigned to a rotavirus group until recently, Group H rotaviruses have been reported to infect both humans and piglets (Molinari et al. 2014).",

The 16\u201327 kb genome is enclosed in a triple layered capsid composed of a double protein shell and an inner core. The 11 segments of RNA code for 11 proteins (six structural and five non-structural). Their classification has been traditionally based on the antigenic properties of two structural proteins, VP7 (G-type glycoprotein) and VP4 (P-type protease-sensitive protein), which comprise the shell and spike proteins of the outer capsid, respectively, and are important in virus infectivity and immunogenicity. The proteins have been used to define P and G serotypes of rotaviruses (Estes and Kapikian 2007). However, serotyping is time consuming and immunological reagents are not always readily available. While there is good correlation between G serotypes and VP7 genotypes, P serotype and VP4 genotyping results are not always in agreement (Greenberg and Estes 2009), so classification is now mainly based on sequencing of these genes or a double nomenclature for P types, based on genotype and serotype information (Desselberger 2014). Genotyping by sequencing is based on identities between sequences of cognate gene segments. There are at least 27 G genotypes and 37 P genotypes within the Rotavirus A (RVA) species (Desselberger 2014). Predominant strains circulating globally include six G types (G1-4, G9, and G12) and two P types (P[4] and P[8]). The six G- and P-type combinations accounting for 80\u201390 % of all rotavirus infections in North America, Europe and Australia include, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8] and G12P[8] (Desselberger 2014). In Africa, G5, G6 and G8 types predominate (Desselberger 2014). A Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG) charged with developing a genome classification system for RVA was recently formed to address the lack of uniformity in the literature (Matthijnssens et al. 2008). In 2008, abbreviations for all 11 RNA segments were defined and percent cut-off values established for categorizing rotavirus strains using a common nomenclature (Matthijnssens et al. 2008). Furthermore, the RCWG proposed a standardized strain nomenclature system for reporting complete rotavirus genome sequences and for use in epidemiologic studies (RV group/species of origin/country of identification/common name/year of identification/G- and P-type). Since this time, 50 new genotypes have been reported and in several cases, a link between animal and human strains has been revealed (Greenberg and Estes 2009).",

Addition of trypsin to the culture medium is required to enhance viral growth in cell cultures. Rotaviruses do not show the same tolerance to extreme conditions as other enteric viruses although they are stable in the environment and can be stored for several months at 4 \u00b0C or even at 20 \u00b0C. They are resistant to drying and may survive on fomites and surfaces, but are labile under conditions of high relative humidity (approximately 80 %) (Estes and Kapikian 2007). Heating at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min reduces their infectivity by 99 % and infectivity is rapidly lost at pH <3.0 and >10.0. Repeated cycles of freeze-thaw can also destroy infectivity. The viruses are resistant to solvents such as ether and chloroform and to non-ionic detergents such as deoxycholate. Chelating agents such as EDTA disrupt the outer shell and inactivate rotaviruses. Treatment with disinfectants such as chlorine, phenol, formalin and 95 % ethanol is also effective against rotavirus (Estes and Kapikian 2007). Normal cooking temperatures are usually sufficient to inactivate rotaviruses. The viruses are found in water and sewage, are resistant to chlorine levels present in the drinking water distribution system and are persistent in the environment. Human rotavirus can survive for several weeks in river water at 4 and 20 \u00b0C.",

The characteristic symptoms of vomiting and watery diarrhea develop quickly and persist for 3\u20138 days, frequently accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. Dehydration is a key factor that contributes to the high infant death rate from rotavirus disease, especially in developing countries where rehydration therapy is often not readily available. Virus is shed in feces for 5\u20137 days. The main transmission route is fecal-oral. Since rotaviruses most often infect young children, the major route of transmission is believed to be person-to-person through care-givers and the general adult population. Rotaviruses, particularly group B, can also infect adults and have been occasionally associated with food and water outbreaks. In the early 1980s, a large waterborne epidemic affecting nearly 1 million persons was reported in China (Hung et al. 1984). Waterborne outbreaks have also been reported from Germany, Israel, Sweden, Russia, Turkey and the US (Ansari et al. 1991; Koroglu et al. 2011; Sattar and Tetro 2001). Rotavirus infections are more common during the winter months in countries with a temperate climate. In tropical regions, outbreaks can occur in cool, dry months as well as throughout the year especially when transmission is related to contaminated water supplies or in the absence of sewage treatment systems (Ansari et al. 1991; Cook et al. 1990).",

Cross-contamination of foods during preparation in the home may be an important source of infection for children, particularly for weaning infants (Motarjemi et al. 1993). Eleven foodborne outbreaks consisting of 460 cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis were reported in New York between 1985 and 1990. Seven of these outbreaks were associated with food-service premises and the implicated foods included salad, cold foods, shepherd\u2019s pie, and water or ice (Sattar and Tetro 2001). In Japan, a foodborne rotavirus outbreak was reported among adults eating restaurant-prepared meals (Iizuka et al. 2000). College-age students in the United States became ill following consumption of tuna or chicken salad sandwiches prepared by food workers testing positive for the same P[4], G2 rotavirus strain that was detected in the stools of the students (CDC 2000).",

There is mounting evidence of zoonotic transmission between humans and animals, particularly when domestic animals are kept in close proximity to humans. Interspecies replication of rotaviruses occurs readily with many rotavirus strains, but is less commonly associated with disease. Exploitation of this fact was the basis for construction of live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine candidates. Due to the segmented nature of the viral genome, there is potential for genomic reassortment of human and animal rotaviruses. Close interspecies relationships between porcine-human and bovine-human strains have been identified by RNA-RNA hybridization and more recently by full genome sequencing. Several rotavirus strains that have caused illness in humans in Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa have now been either confirmed or are highly suspected to have emerged after reassortment with animal rotaviruses (Martella et al. 2010). Continued efforts to generate full-length genome sequences for human and animal rotavirus strains will thus be important for further elucidation of the zoonotic potential of rotaviruses.",

Transmission is through the fecal-oral route via food, water and person-to-person contact, especially in nurseries, childcare centers and hospitals. Asymptomatic excretion is estimated to be approximately 10 % in most human populations but as high as 30 % prevalence rates have been reported in developing countries (De Benedictis et al. 2011; De Grazia et al. 2011; Guix et al. 2002).

Astroviruses are 28\u201330 nm icosohedral, non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of about 6.8\u20137.8 kb and a buoyant density of 1.32 g/ml in potassium tartrate-glycerol gradient (Table 2.1). Since only 10 % of astroviruses exhibit the typical 5 or 6 pointed star-like morphology by direct EM, the efficiency of detection was restricted until the introduction of molecular detection methods and improved culture techniques. Eight human astrovirus species (HAstVs 1-8) have been identified based on serotyping but new species continue to emerge through molecular studies. Currently there are 33 genotypes in the Mamastrovirus genus and 11 genotypes in the Avastrovirus genus (Bosch et al. 2014). Mamastrovirus species are also detected in bovine, feline, porcine, canine, ovine, mink, rodent, bat and marine mammal hosts. Avastroviruses include turkey, chicken and duck astroviruses as well as the avian nephritis virus (De Benedictis et al. 2011).",

Human, porcine, bovine and avian astroviruses have been adapted to grow in established cell lines, but trypsin is required in the growth medium to boost infectivity for all astroviruses except chicken astroviruses. Propagation of reference strains and wild-type astroviruses from stool suspensions is most successfulwith the adenocarcinoma cell lines, Caco-2 and T-84, and the human liver hepatoma cell line, PLC/PRF/5 (Mendez and Arias 2007). Virus detection is carried out mainly by EM of stool specimens, diagnostic RT-PCR using broadly reactive primers, or by an integrated cell culture-RT-PCR (ICC-RT-PCR) procedure. Astroviruses are resistant to extreme environmental conditions. Their heat tolerance allows them to survive 50 \u00b0C for 1 h. At 60 \u00b0C, the virus titer falls by 3 log10 and 6 log10 after 5 and 15 min, respectively. Astroviruses are stable for years at \u2264 \u221270 \u00b0C but repeated freeze/thawing cycles can lead to structural damage. The virus is stable at pH 3.0 and is resistant to chemicals, including chloroform, lipid solvents, and alcohols and to non-ionic, anionic and Zwitter ionic detergents. Astrovirus particles exhibit a range of buoyant densities in cesium chloride (CsCl), from 1.35 to 1.39 g/mL for complete virus particles, and from 1.28 to 1.33 g/mL for empty (no genome) capsids or VLPs. Divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) in CsCl facilitate virus and VLP stabilization (Mendez and Arias 2007).",

The outbreak was traced to food prepared by a common supplier for school lunches; astrovirus type 6 was identified by immune electron microscopy and confirmed by molecular and culture methods. There are several reports of astrovirus genomes identified in shellfish and evidence indicates that astroviruses may contribute to outbreaks of gastroenteritis through consumption of contaminated oysters (Kitahashi et al. 1999; Le Guyader et al. 2008; Ming et al. 2013). In a French shellfish-related gastroenteritis outbreak, astroviruses were among a range of enteric viruses identified in patient feces and related shellfish samples (Le Guyader et al. 2008).

Adenoviruses are 80\u2013110 nm non-enveloped, linear double-stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral symmetry and a genome of 28\u201345 kb (Table 2.1, Fig. 2.1c). Most human adenovirus (HAdV) infections in normally healthy individuals are mild or subclinical but can be associated with respiratory, ocular and gastrointestinal disease. HAdV-F types 40 and 41 are generally associated with fecal-oral spread and cause gastroenteritis, although all types are shed in feces, often in large numbers (up to 1011 particles/g feces) for several months (Wold and Horwitz 2007). Over 60 human adenovirus types have been recognized that appear to be specific to humans as none have been detected in the stools of domestic and wild mammals (Jiang 2006). This feature makes them a good candidate for microbial source tracking to identify sources of fecal pollution (Wong et al. 2012).",

Adenoviruses can be transmitted person-to-person by direct contact or via fecal-oral, respiratory or environmental routes. Waterborne transmission of adenovirus has been associated with conjunctivitis in children. Enteric adenovirus infections are common all year round, whereas outbreaks of adenovirus-associated respiratory disease normally occur from late winter to early summer. Adenoviruses have been detected in a variety of environmental samples, including wastewater, sludge, shellfish, and marine, surface and drinking waters. No foodborne or waterborne outbreaks associated with the enteric adenoviruses have been reported but, as these viruses are common in the environment, it is possible that disease has occurred but the source of infection was not recognized. There are no reports of foodborne transmission or disease resulting from consumption of adenovirus-contaminated shellfish.",

The incubation period is usually between 3 and 7 days with virus transmission occurring from 3 to 10 days after symptoms develop. Enteroviral infection is most common in summer and early autumn and many infections are asymptomatic.

Because they are easily cultured in vitro and are stable in the environment, live attenuated vaccine strains of poliovirus have been used as indicator viruses for the presence of other virulent enteric viruses in food and water. They have also been used extensively in environmental and food virology research for method development and to gather information on virus recovery, persistence and behavior in these settings. The first recorded outbreak associated with foodborne viruses was an outbreak of poliomyelitis linked to consumption of raw milk in 1914 (Jubb 1915). A further ten outbreaks associated with raw milk consumption were reported in the USA and United Kingdom over the following 35 years (Sattar and Tetro 2001). The widespread introduction of pasteurized milk in the 1950s decreased transmission by this route. There have been few recorded foodborne outbreaks associated with enterovirus infection despite the regular occurrence of enteroviruses in the environment. Enteroviruses, including echoviruses and coxsackie A and B viruses, have been isolated from sewage, raw and digested sludge, marine and fresh waters, and shellfish. In two reported foodborne outbreaks associated with echoviruses in the United States, the source of the virus was not identified (Cliver 1997). Although enteroviruses are often present in shellfish, other enteric viruses are also usually present and no shellfish\u2014associated outbreaks have been reported specifically for enteroviruses.",

Aichiviruses have been detected in stools, human sewage and in shellfish worldwide, but seem to be more often detected in Asian countries. Aichivirus was identified in 33 % of 57 commercial packages of Japanese clams (Hansman et al. 2008). The first identifications of the virus outside Asia occurred in clinical specimens in Germany and Brazil (Oh et al. 2006). Aichiviruses were also among several enteric viruses identified in clinical specimens and oysters associated with a gastroenteritis outbreak in France (Le Guyader et al. 2008). Since it is often detected along with other viruses associated with gastrointestinal illness, its importance as a food- and water-borne pathogen is still unclear.

Although they have been isolated from feces of children and adults with diarrhea (Koopmans et al. 1991), their exact role in human gastroenteritis and foodborne disease is still unknown.",

These viruses have been detected in feces of many animals and birds and are known to cause gastroenteritis in a range of domestic animals. They have also been detected in humans with and without diarrhea and are now regarded as opportunistic pathogens which can cause gastroenteritis in immunocompromised patients. They have been detected in sewage and river waters (Hamza et al. 2011) and in humans from several countries, including Australia, Brazil, England and the USA. Their role as true human pathogens is unproven and although there is no documented evidence of foodborne transmission, it is likely that they can be transmitted by the fecal-oral route and possibly via food.",

Tick-borne encephalitis is a zoonotic arbovirus infection endemic to Eastern and Central Europe and Russia. However, the distribution of these viruses can extend to Northern Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Three subtypes of TBE virus cause tick-borne encephalitis: the Eastern European subtype, the Western European subtype and the Siberian subtype. Most cases occur in spring and summer following bites of different species of Ixodes tick. Foodborne transmission is less common but can occur following consumption of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk, yogurt, butter and cheese from infected cattle and goats (D\u00f6bbecker et al. 2010). The disease is serious and can result in long-term neurological sequelae or death. Increased tourism to the endemic areas has extended the risk of travellers acquiring TBE.
