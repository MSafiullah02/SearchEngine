The virus is highly contagious with potential human-human transmission which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across six continents and emerged as a global pandemic in short span with alarming levels of spread and severity. This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 . The SARS-CoV-2 possesses enveloped club-like spike protein projections with positive-sense large RNA genome and has a unique replication strategy. This virus was believed to have zoonotic origin with genetical identity to bat and pangolin CoV. In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity. Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options. Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19.",

Highly acidic endosomal pH is needed for the fusion and eventually uncoating of the envelope (25) . Further, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm and translates into two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab that encode non-structural proteins, and form replication-transcription complex (RTC) (26) . Continuously the polymerase produces a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs and finally translates into relevant viral proteins. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi together assemble the newly formed genomic RNA, envelope, nucleocapsid and glycoproteins in vesicles thereby the virion fuses with the plasma membrane to release outside the cell. The envelope protein E has conserved the functional features, such as ion-channels and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) which is required to induce virulence (27). The virus can infect ACE2-bearing cells in organs such as lung, esophagus, mouth, heart, intestines, bladder, and kidney (28) (Figure 3 ). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from BAL or throat swab from nine patient samples and found interesting observations that the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences exhibited more than 99\u00b798% sequence similarity among different patient samples tested, which shows that the smaller degree of diversification. They also found an 88% similarity to bat derived SARS like CoVs including bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Interestingly, this study also compared the similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where it was observed a 79 and 50% similarity which indicates that these viruses are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, in late December Wuhan bat species were in hibernation and were not available for sale in the seafood market. This report also speculates that and various evidences has been described in Table 2 .",

The current evidence suggest that human-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by coughing or sneezing from the infected individual through respiratory droplets (droplet particles >5-10 \u03bcm in diameter) in close contact (within 1 meter) or as droplet nuclei (particles <5\u03bcm in diameter) which can remain in the air for long periods and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 meter. The transmission is also possible with the indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment exposes to the mucosa by nose and mouth or conjunctiva (eyes) for the viral entry During an emerging pandemic outbreak of an infectious disease, it is essential to know the level of transmission and the contagiousness which can be estimated by \"R naught\" (R0), a mathematical term which is the basic reproduction number that determines the average number secondary cases who are previously free of infection gets infected by one sick host. If the R0 is less than one the existing infection causes less than one infection, in such cases the spread J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f declines and disappears. If R0 value equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection may spread on an average more than one individual which may lead to dramatic increase in transmission and may result in epidemic (45). The R0 value of SARS was ranging from 1 and 2.75, while the R0 of MERS-CoV was <1. The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China was estimated to be in the range of 2.24 to 3.58 in the early phases (46). Steven Sanche et.al found that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be 5.7 (47). Data from six different studies estimated that R0 could range from 1.5 to 6.49, with an average of 4.2.",

However, there are documented additional fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and incidence of grand-glass opacities (an area of increased attenuation in the lung on computed tomography (CT) with preserved bronchial and vascular markings in the periphery of the lungs with haziness overlying an area of the lung) (50) in some cases which lead to increased mortality rate (51). Recent evidence suggest that 97.5% of infected individuals develop symptoms within 11.5 days and the median incubation period to develop symptoms was estimated to be 5.1 days and 101 out of every 10000 cases were found to develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine (52).",

            "text": "Cytokine storm refers to an aberrant or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines that lead to acute inflammation and pyrexia, which begins at a local site and spreads throughout the body via the systemic circulation. The previous out breaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have witnessed acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS and death which is accompanied by rapid virus replication that led to excessive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm (54). Similarly, now in COVID-19 outbreak, elevated cytokine levels are observed in critically ill patients. A case report by Chen et al, has observed a markedly higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-2R, and IL-6, with remarkable reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, nearly in all 11 severe cases tested as compared to 10 moderate cases. The reduction in T lymphocyte number may further reduce the production of IFN-\u03b3 (55). These findings are in line with Pederson et.al and Diao et.al which demonstrated that the depletion of T cells and dysfunction in COVID-19, which can be implicated with the cytokine storm through the activation of highly inflammatory macrophages that produce the inflammatory cytokines and may dampen adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, an increase in the inflammatory indicators such as D-dimer and procalcitonin were found (56,57). Based on the clinical data by Hui Li many critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical sepsis symptoms such as cold extremities, shock weak peripheral pulses and severe metabolic acidosis and hypothesized that the viral sepsis could be one of the critical clinical manifestations in cytokine storm. However, very little is known about the involvement of Toll like receptors (TLR) (58). In another case study, the COVID-19 patients plasma samples were analyzed for cytokines by multiplex assay, where IL-1\u03b2, IL-7, IL-10, IL-8, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f IL-9, basic FGF, IL1-RA, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, MCP-1, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1,   VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3 were found to be elevated in both (Intensive care unit) ICU and non-ICU   patients, while no apparent changes were found in the levels of IL-15, IL12p70, IL-5, Eotaxin, and RANTES when compared to healthy adults. On the other side, the higher plasma levels of IL-7, IL-2, IL-10, GSCF, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and IP-10 were observed in ICU patients in comparison with non-ICU patients. This data suggest that the disease severity might be through the involvement of cytokine storm with SARS-CoV-2 infected critically ill patients (53).",

Apart from these symptoms, prolonged prothrombin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in 80 and 55 patients, respectively. Another observation was a gradual increase in blood urea, creatinine levels, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts before death. The other major complications during hospitalization are shock, arrhythmia, ARDS, and acute kidney injury (59). Chen and colleagues based on a retrospective, single-center study on 99 cases (20), subsequently, Qian and colleagues reported that in 67.03% infected patients had multilobe infiltration in 53.85% patient population and an elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was seen, further in 15.39% patients elevated levels of procalcitonin was detected. Interestingly, in one case report COVID-19 had been detected from the rectal swab, who suffered from abdominal symptoms but tested twice negative by throat swab (60). Therefore, along with the antiviral therapy it may be crucial to use antiinflammatory agents in treating COVID-19 patients. Theoretically, corticosteroids may suppress lung inflammation, and they have been prescribed in 72.2% of ICU patients (61) but its efficacy in treating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is still controversial as the concerns J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f centered around their short-and long-term adverse effects as well as promotion of viral rebound and ARDS (62).Therefore, it is important to identify the cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanism behind the cytokine storm.

Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit the heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemozoin. Plasmodium species continue to accumulate toxic heme, killing the parasite and exhibits antimalarial activity (78) . Whereas the antiviral activity of chloroquine is exerted by diffusing into the host cells and accumulating in endosomes, lysosomes and Galgi complexes, where it is converted into protonated form, then this moiety is deposited in organelles and further involve in raising the surrounding pH (79) . The raised pH in endosomes and lysosomes prevent viral fusion and inhibits the viral entry by endocytosis into the cells (80) . ACE2 is the target receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for viral fusion, however, chloroquine does not affect the ACE2 levels but downregulated the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 (79, 81, 82) . Insufficient Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been used extensively to understand the mechanism of Nanoparticles uptake into cells. It was used as inhibitor of Nanoparticles uptake via endocytosis pathway. Similar kind of viral particle entry through endocytosis route is proposed to be inhibited by Chloroquine (83) . Artemisone found to be effective against human cytomegaloviruses, but effect of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 needs to be evaluated (89,90). Moreover, the severe inflammatory cytokine storm observed in multiple organs may be curtailed by Chloroquine due to its immunomodulatory effects.",

Another group of researchers found evidence of CoV by genomic sequencing in dead Malayan pangolins and named it as Pangolin-CoV and found that 91.02% similarity to SARS-CoV-2, and 90.55% with Bat CoV RaTG13, have provided evidence based J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f most possible intermediate reservoir to humans. Their findings propose the aptitude for evolution with higher chances of homologous recombination between bat and pangolin CoVs and emerged as SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus with mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (39,40).

It is commonly used in the treatment of pneumonia, sinusitis, lyme disease, skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases (91). Apart from antibacterial activity, Azithromycin has antiviral activity observed in bronchial epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus, where it increased the production of interferon-stimulated genes (92). Additionally, its antiviral activity was reported against Zika virus in human glial cells, where it prevented the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f virus induced alterations in fetal brain (93). Also, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was found to be effective in SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia, where this combination significantly decreased the virus load and involved in the elimination of virus (94). Energetics based modeling suggests that this drug combination might show the effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complex. Recently Pfizer has reported the necessary data of azithromycin for SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials (NCT04321278) (95).

Remdesivir exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity and showed beneficial results in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV induced respiratory infections. It has been recommended to administer to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in United States of America, Europe, and Japan, where physicians found the beneficial results(107). But it is not yet approved by the drug regulators for treating the patients who are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Gilead has started the clinical trials for the potential treatment of COVID-19 (108). Remdesivir is a prodrug and is metabolised to its active form GS-441524, which is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNAdependent RNA polymerases(109). It interferes with the viral RNA polymerase activity and further inhibits the viral exoribonuclease involved in proofreading and ultimately causes the deprivation of viral RNA production(110).Remdesivir  was tested in clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, where it exhibited significant antiviral activity. Further, it was also tested in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f combination with Chloroquine and found to be effective against COVID-19 (79). However, the data available is limited on Remdesivir and further studies need to be conducted to prove its essential role in treating COVID-19 along with its drug-drug interactions and contraindications. Oseltamivir is recommended to treat and prevention of Influenza A and Influenza B viruses. It belongs to the class of neuraminidase inhibitors and acts as a competitive inhibitor of neuraminidase enzyme present in influenza virus and prevents the respiratory tract infections. This enzyme involved in the cleavage of the sialic acid which is an important component of glycoproteins present on the surface of human cells and helps new virions to exit the cells (111). The therapeutic potential of Oseltamavir on SARS-CoV-2 infections need to be evaluated. Few of the combinational drugs such as ASC09F and Ritonavir are being evaluated together with Oseltamivir, these are under the clinical trials now. The anti-HIV drugs and protease inhibitors Lopinavir and Ritonavir were found to be effective in SARS-CoV infections and also these drugs are currently under the clinical trials for testing the efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2 (112). Investigators performed an open-label randomized trial at Wuhan hospital, China. They have given the treatment to adult SARS-CoV-2 patients with oral Lopinavir and Ritonavir (400&100 mg, respectively) twice daily for 14 days. They found that Lopinavir and Ritonavir combination was significantly effective against SARS-CoV-2 (113). However, further studies are needed to draw a clear conclusion on the usage of combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2.",

CR3022 epitope was not overlapped with the ACE2 binding site within SARS-CoV-2 RBD ((132). This novel monoclonal antibody might be effective clinically for treating SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia. Zhongyu Zhu et al. tested the human monoclonal antibody m396 for treating the SARS-CoV, which competes with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2 and inhibits the interaction J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between SARS-CoV and ACE2 (133). Chunyan Wang and coworkers tested human monoclonal antibody 47D11 on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains, where it binds with conserved epitope present on the spike RBD and further it cross-neutralized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and this mode of action is independent to receptor binding inhibition (134). Anjeanette Roberts and colleagues developed monoclonal antibody MAb 201 and tested on the golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection, where it inhibited the viral replication and decreased the interstitial pneumonitis (135). Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible due to interaction of spike protein with human ACE2, thus spike protein is the main target for antibodymediated neutralization. Various neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are tested against SARS-CoV including 80R, CR3014, CR3022, m396, B1, 201, 68, 1F8, and 5E9, these antibodies might play an important therapeutic role in SARS-CoV-2 infections (136). Collectively, spike proteins, ACE2 and their interactions are the main targets for developing new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.Tocilizumab is used in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myoloma and it is a human recombinant IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody(137). It is associated with major side effects such as allergy, liver toxicity and hyperlipidaemia(138). IL-6 is involved in the activation of various immunological and inflammatory mediators, which are responsible for respiratory collapse observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Tocilizumab is under phase II clinical trials and tested for SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia (NCT04317092).Another IL-6R monoclonal antibody Sarilumab is under clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04315298). It is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and it suppresses the IL6R mediated inflammation(139). Cytokine storm is responsible for the pneumonia conditionin SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Clinical trials on Sarilumab and Remdesivir have been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f initiated to test the therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (140).

Additionally, Curcumin also inhibited the SARS-CoV replication and the effective concentration (EC 50 value) was found to be around 10 \u03bcM and also acted as a protease inhibitor(142). Thus it might be effective againstSARS-CoV-2 infections, where intravenous (i.v.) route of administration in suitable formulation form may enhance the better bioavailability. Similarly, a thorough search across all the natural products needs to be evaluated for their direct antiviral effects and their potential role in controlling severe inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 induced pneumonia. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe Indian traditional plant Neem (Azadirachta Indica) and its parts such as leaves, seeds, flowers, barks and routes are widely using in various diseases. Ancient people believe that it is a Sarva roga nivarini (the cure for all diseases). Methanolic extract of neem leaves exhibited antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 infections by inhibiting HSV-1 glycoprotein mediated viral fusion and polykaryocytes(143). Nimbolide is an active constituent of Neem tree explored as a pharmacological modulator in treating various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases(144). TNF-\u03b1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in activation of various signaling cascade and this cytokine might be playing role in respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 mediated pneumonia. Nimbolide is found to be TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor and also suppresses the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-\u03baB and HDAC-3 and inhibited the cytokine storm observed in ARDS experimental model(145). Thus it might show beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections by direct antiviral activity or indirect supportive therapy by controlling the inflammatory cytokine storm. This natural product may have clinical significance in inflammation associated with viral diseases. The other natural product Withaferin A is isolated from Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and widely used to treat various diseases such as cancer, fibrosis, and inflammatory disorders. It has shown the antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex virus 1 and 2(146), which may show plausible effects against COVID-19.",

Vaccines are available as prophylactic Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as well as therapeutic agents. Apart from the traditional live attenuating method, Novavax is constructing the recombinant vaccine, where the antigens stably expressed from the spike protein in baculovirus system(160). In this method, they are isolating the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is involved to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and this sequence is pasted into the genome of a bacterium or yeast, where it will produce the large quantity of protein of interest.The mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-COV-2 was developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the clinical trials. Here, the mRNA vaccine isinjected to the people through intra muscular route, where the immunogens are produced in human cells instead of recombinant system and exhibit the higher immunocompatibility(162). In this mRNA vaccine system, the uridines are modified into pseudouridines in order to prevent the immune-mediated reactions exerted by toll-like receptors such as TLR7 and TLR8, where they recognize the uridines and further activate the interferon response(163,164). This vaccine strategy is currently under phase I clinical trials, where they are working on two objectives, the first objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity measured by ELISA to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57(165). However, it will take some more time to evaluate its full efficacy and safety potential before it is allowed for patient application by regulatory bodies. Similar type mRNA vaccine BNT162 was developed by BioNTech and Pfizer against COVID-19, which is under the clinical trials(166). -Immune Medical Institute has developed synthetic minigene vaccine LV-SMENP-DC and antigen-specific CTLs and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) for SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine is under the clinical trials, where they are going to test safety and efficacy of innovative SARS-CoV-2 minigenes, engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (LV) to express viral proteins and immune-modulatory genes to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and aAPC to activate cytotoxic T cells(167). Additionally, Chinese based company CanSino Biologics has developed the recombinant novel CoVs vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) candidate in alliance with Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (BIB), based on the viral vector vaccine technology platform, which was previously used to develop Ebola vaccine. This vaccine strategy has given significant results in preclinical studies, now they have received the approval to initiate clinical trials and Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing on(168).University of Oxford researchers have developed the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and this vaccine was tested on 18-55 years old UK healthy adult volunteers. Further studies and data are needed to get clearance from regulatory authorities, which might need significant amount of time(169).",

The recent epidemiological study suggests that universal BCG vaccination might play an important role in controlling the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The SARS-CoV-2 affected countries mortality is different in various countries; it may be due to temperature, elder population, humidity, cultural differences, migration, and health systems. New York Institute of TechnologyJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (NYIT) scientists proposed that the countries that do not opt the universal BCG vaccination were affected mainly by SARS-CoV-2 infections such as Italy, Netherlands, and USA etc. as compared to the counties who follow the universal BCG vaccination (173). BCG vaccination offers broad-spectrum activity against the prevention of respiratory infections and it might reduce the SARS-CoV-2 oriented mortalities. Currently, Australia, Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) have started the clinical trials first on the front line health workers (174). If it works effectively in SARS-CoV-2, it will be a game-changer in vaccine research in the current overwhelming situation. Various Pharmaceutical and Biotechnological companies such as Sanofi, Zydus Cadila, Codagenix, Serum Institute of India, Bharath Biotech, Inovio Pharmaceuticals & Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology, Sanofi & Translate Bio, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) and Seqirus have started the vaccine development programs in association with academic institutes, research centers and hospitals.

Apart from traditional drug therapy, researchers are trying to treat patients who suffer from SARS-CoV-2 infections with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).MSCs are the type of multipotent stromal cells that can able to differentiate into various types of cells such as myocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes(176). SARS-CoV-2 enhances J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f thepro-inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-\u03b1 and further causes the terrible cytokine storm in the lungs followed by edema, alveolar dysfunction for theair exchange, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and the systemic infection, which may ultimately lead to death (53). MSCs are having a powerful immunomodulating effects and may involve in preventing and reducing the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2. Zikuan Leng et al. treated seven patients who are suffering from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with MSCs in Beijing You'an Hospital, China. They have evaluated the inflammation and immunerelated parameters for 14 days after a single infusion of MSCs, where they found that all the patients recovered from all the symptoms without any adverse effects. Where MSCs inhibited the cytokine storm by upregulating the cytotoxic cells and suppressed the TNF-\u03b1 levels. Thus, the intravenous administration of MSCs will be a safe and effective approach for treating severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients (177). Various scientific groups are working on MSCs to treat SARS-CoV-2 and few of the studies are under the clinical trials (Table 8) Cytotoxic lymphocytes mainly available as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, these are essential for limiting the dangerous viral infections. Meijuan Zheng et al. reported that CD8+ T-cells and NK cells were significantly decreased, while NKG2A expression was dramatically increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (178). NK cells recognize the NKG2D, which is an activating receptor of NK cells involved in clearing the virus infected cells. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) exhibit an important role in modifying the NK cells and play an essential role in cell-based immunotherapy for treating cancer and viral diseases (179). Actually, NK cells have shorter half-life and their activity was improved by IL-15 super agonist (sIL-15/IL-15R\u0251 chimeric protein) upto 20 times more and ultimately increases the target cytotoxicity (180). In general Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neutralizes the CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (181). Chongqing Public Health Medical Center has constructed and prepared the universal off-theshelf IL-15 super agonist-and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. This developed vaccine system inhibited expression of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and suppressed the NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2. Additionally, IL-15 super agonist enhances the NK cells activity and CRS is prevented by GM-CSF neutralising scFv. Further, ACE2 CAR-NK cells inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection safely and effectively. These advanced targeted cell therapy strategies need to be evaluated under controlled clinical trials, which is already initiated currently (NCT04280224 and NCT04324996).Apart from the above mentioned pharmacological interventions, few more drugs are illustrated in",

In 2012, another zoonotic CoV were identified from Saudi Arabia postulated to have originated from the dromedary camels which infected 2494 people and 858 deaths were reported(184), In late December 2019, a recent global J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f outbreak, a novel CoV strain has been evolved which is linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China with the symptoms varying from mild respiratory illness and pneumonia in most of the patients, to fatal consequences that progresses to ARDS by the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm. As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.43 million cases of COVID-19 has been confirmed worldwide, and this pandemic is rapidly escalating all around the globe and most of the countries implemented the most restrictive mass quarantines that led to severe global socioeconomic disruption which has become the greatest concern of WHO (185). As of now, there are no specific approved drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 and currently, physicians are using the repurposing drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Azithromycine, Dexamethasone, Acetaminophen etc., and they are showing plausible results, however more studies are required for specific use against SARS-CoV-2.Moreover, immune boosters such as Vitamin C, Zinc and other natural products are suggested in preventing the viral infections. Additionally, scientists are developing the new antiviral drugs and vaccines, and few are under the clinical trials. Apart from traditional drug therapy, medical practitioners are transfusing the convalescent plasma to rescue the critically ill patients with successful outcome in viral load reduction; Also, MSCs were effective for treatment with encouraging improvement with fewer side effects. Thus there is a lot of scope to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; there is a need for vigorous effort on the vaccine development and exploration of potential antiviral treatment regimens. Simultaneously, the primary and intermediate host and mechanism of its cross-species spread and human interface needs to be investigated. Owing to the fact that new CoV viruses will continue to evolve on the basis of their ability to undergo frequent recombination's of their genomes, mutations, the propensity to infect multiple species and the increasing human-animal interface, Huang Y.
