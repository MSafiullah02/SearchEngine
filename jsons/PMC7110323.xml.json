Although viral infections until recently were not commonly diagnosed, it is becoming clear from epidemiological studies that caliciviruses alone may be as frequent causes of foodborne illness as Salmonella[[6], [8]].

In the last 27 years, several viruses have been identified as etiological agents of viral gastroenteritis in humans [16]. In most studies of food\u2010 and waterborne viruses, samples have been screened for viruses by tissue culture isolation techniques or by electron microscopy (EM). Some enteric viruses, however, cannot be grown in tissue culture, and EM is rather insensitive with a detection limit of around 105\u2013106 particles per ml of stool suspension. Broadly reactive and user\u2010friendly diagnostic tests, such as enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), have routinely been used for group A rotavirus and adenovirus in clinical specimens only. Recently, ELISA\u2010based assays have been developed for detection of astroviruses and NLV [[17], [18], [19]], but the latter lack the broadness that is required for generic detection. No similar assays exist for testing food samples. As a result of these limitations, foodborne viral gastroenteritis is usually not diagnosed.",

Using this definition, an estimated 32\u201342% of foodborne enteric infections in the USA are caused by viruses. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis may be caused by rotaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses, and the human enteric caliciviruses. The human caliciviruses are assigned to two genera, which are currently described as \u2018Norwalk\u2010like viruses\u2019 (NLV), also known as small round structured viruses, and \u2018Sapporo\u2010like viruses\u2019 (SLV), also known as typical caliciviruses [[22], [23], [24], [25]].

A major breakthrough was the discovery of the Norwalk virus (NV) using immune EM (IEM) in fecal samples collected during an outbreak of gastroenteritis, which occurred in 1968 in an elementary school in Norwalk, OH, USA [30]. These viruses were non\u2010enveloped and the particles had a \u2018fuzzy\u2019 amorphous appearance and measured 34\u201338 nm in diameter. Volunteer studies established NV as an enteric pathogen and, except for the unsuccessful cultivation of the virus, fulfilled Koch's postulates [[31], [32]]. Since then, additional studies have been carried out using fecal samples from other outbreaks of gastroenteritis, containing particles which were morphologically indistinguishable from NV [[33], [34]]. These viruses have often been named after the geographic setting in which the outbreak occurred, for example, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Montgomery county virus, Toronto virus. This practice became a routine procedure and persists to the present day.",

Astroviruses may have the five/six\u2010pointed surface star on up to 20% of the particles, which makes it possible to distinguish them from typical caliciviruses [36]. However, because these viruses were detected as frequently in asymptomatic as in sick children, no clinical significance could be attached to this finding. The first convincing association with disease came from a study of \u2018winter vomiting disease\u2019 which occurred in a school in London in January 1978 [37], and since then, typical caliciviruses have been linked with cases of mild diarrhea in both infants and children and shown to induce illness in volunteers [38].",

The distinguishing feature between the genome organization of NLV and SLV is the arrangement of the open reading frames (ORFs). In both genera, ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein (1789 amino acids for NV) with conserved regions of amino acid similarity with the picornavirus 2C helicase, 3C protease, and 3D polymerase [[22], [24]]. For NLV, the ORF2 region encodes the single major capsid protein (\u224556 kDa) [24]. A third ORF encodes a minor structural protein with a predicted molecular mass of 22.5 kDa [39]. In SLV, the region encoding the capsid protein (60 kDa for the prototype of this group, Manchester virus) is found in the same reading frame as ORF1, and is contiguous with the non\u2010structural proteins. Together, the non\u2010structural genes and the major capsid gene form one long polyprotein, which occupies over 90% of the total genome [25].

Data from a recently completed community\u2010based cohort study in The Netherlands were surprising in that 20% of NLV\u2010infected persons reported symptoms for more than 2 weeks, suggesting that NLV infections may be less innocuous (Rockx et al., in preparation). In adults, projectile vomiting occurs frequently. Sometimes parenteral fluid therapy or even hospitalization is required, with up to 12% of cases hospitalized in a recent outbreak in military recruits [[27], [33], [40], [41]]. Deaths associated with NLV outbreaks have been reported, but the etiologic association needs to be confirmed [[8], [12]]. The average attack rate is high (typically 45% or more) [10]. Virus is shed via stools and vomit, starting during the incubation period, and lasting up to 10 days, and possibly longer [[20], [26], [42], [43]]. NLV infections are highly contagious, resulting in a high rate of transmission to contacts. Mixtures of symptoms may occur, since contaminated foods may contain multiple agents [44].",

However, EM is a relatively insensitive technique, requiring the presence of a minimum of around 105\u2013106 particles per ml of stool sample, and \u2013 unlike some other enteric viruses \u2013 NLV are not shed to very high maximum titers. This may not be a problem in outbreak investigations, when similar results may be obtained when stool samples have been collected promptly [48]. For community\u2010based studies, however, this was an impediment until the complete genome of the NLV prototype, the Norwalk virus, was sequenced from cDNA clones derived from RNA that had been extracted from a bulk stool specimen [[23], [24]]. From early work with IEM, and later sequence analysis of genomes of different NLV strains, it became evident that the NLV are in fact an antigenically and genetically diverse group of viruses [[49], [50], [51], [52], [53]]. At present, genome\u2010based detection methods are available, in which fragments of the viral RNA are amplified directly from stool samples by reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) ([[54], [55]], reviewed in [47]). Initial studies using these methods to detect viral RNA in outbreak specimens confirmed the unusual level of divergence, even when a highly conserved region of the viral genome was selected as a target for the RT\u2010PCR [[51], [56], [57], [58]]. Since then, second generation assays have been developed, which have been optimized for detection of a broad range of NLV, by targeting conserved motifs in the non\u2010structural protein genes [[9], [57], [59], [60]]. Following detection of NLV by RT\u2010PCR, the PCR products can be characterized further by sequencing (described in Section 2.9).",

However, the current problem is that (hyper)immune responses are predominantly type\u2010specific, and that assays based on these reagents are narrow in their applicability [[19], [60], [65]]. NLV are a diverse group of viruses, and can be divided into two, possibly three broad genogroups, based on antigenic and genetic criteria (see Section 2.9). Recently, a NV\u2010specific monoclonal antibody was characterized with reactivity to strains from four out of five other variants within genogroup I NLV that were tested [66]. Similarly, for genogroup II NLV, a common epitope has been identified [67]. When tested in an ELISA, this monoclonal appeared to detect GGI viruses as well, suggesting that it detects a genus\u2010specific epitope. These monoclonal antibodies offer the first hope for development of a more broadly reactive detection assay. For a complete overview of NLV diagnostics see Atmar and Estes [47].",

However, an important message is also that the estimate of the proportion of foodborne NLV outbreaks varies greatly from one country to the other, due to differences in case definition, surveillance systems, and methods used. In The Netherlands, approximately 80% of outbreaks of gastroenteritis that were reported in the past seven years to RIVM through health services NLV [[9], [10], [68], [69]]. More than half of these outbreaks occurred in nursing homes [[10], [68]]. The proportion of foodborne outbreaks was 14% in 1994\u20132000, with 83% of these attributed to NLV. This clearly is an underestimate as foodborne outbreaks are usually reported through the regional food inspection services, rather than municipal health services. In a survey of all outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease in England and Wales between 1992 and 1994, 27% outbreaks were caused by NLV (for comparison: 32% of the outbreaks were due to Salmonella spp.) [8]. NLV were the cause of 6% of foodborne outbreaks. Since outbreak specimens were mostly examined by EM, the actual number of NLV outbreaks may be higher [[8], [19]]. In the US, 86 of 90 (96%) outbreaks of non\u2010bacterial acute gastroenteritis reported to CDC between January 1997 and June 1998 were caused by NLV infection. Of those outbreaks for which a mode of transmission was reported, 24 of 51 (47%) were considered foodborne. Several large outbreaks with a serious impact on troops on military aircraft carriers have been described [70]. Nosocomial outbreaks are common [[10], [71], [72]]. In Finland, hospital outbreaks (mostly on geriatric wards) are almost exclusively caused by NLV, but there is serious underreporting. Also in Finland, 56% of the epidemics reported as foodborne, from which stool samples (and foodstuffs, in some instances) were submitted for virological screening, were NLV\u2010positive [73]. Of water epidemics 12/15 have been NLV\u2010positive. Since 1998 15 berry\u2010related epidemics have occurred, which has resulted in a ban on the use of unheated berries in all catering and other large\u2010scale kitchens [74]. Since then, some berry\u2010associated outbreaks have occurred, in cases where the ban was ignored. Most of these outbreaks were linked to imported berries. From molecular typing, based on a 125\u2010bp fragment of a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene, it was shown that many different lineages of NLV could be found, which illustrates that contamination of these foods was not linked to a single common source (Fig. 1).",

Similar studies in the UK suggested a slightly lower incidence of community cases of gastroenteritis (190 cases/1000 persons per year) but with a higher rate of referral to the physician [4]. Again, NLV were surprisingly common causes of illness in people of all age groups. The NLV are the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in young children [[3], [75], [81], [82]]. The course of illness appears to be somewhat milder than rotavirus gastroenteritis [75]. This may explain the lower percentage of hospitalized children with NLV that has been reported [[83], [84]]. Asymptomatic infections are common [[3], [82]].",

Sporadic cases of viral gastroenteritis also occur frequently in these settings. The risk factors for these infections are currently under investigation in the UK and in The Netherlands. According to Gerba et al. [86] the groups of individuals who would be at the greatest risk of serious illness and mortality from water\u2010 and foodborne enteric microorganisms include young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. This segment of the population currently represents almost 20% of the population (in the USA) and is expected to increase significantly in the years to come, due to increases in life\u2010span and the number of immunocompromised individuals. Worldwide, diarrheal diseases account for millions of deaths annually, mostly in developing countries [15]. In developed countries, mortality due to diarrhea is low, but does occur in young children [[14], [87], [88]] and in the elderly (where >50% of all mortality occurs [[11], [13], [86]]). While specific mortality data on NLV are not available, given the high incidence of calicivirus infections in the elderly, it is likely that deaths resulting from calicivirus infection do occur [[8], [12]].",

Typically, variant viruses would be characterized by neutralization assays using hyperimmune sera or panels of monoclonal antibodies in a tissue culture infectivity assay. However, because no one has succeeded in culturing these viruses in vitro, their antigenic relationships have been evaluated primarily by cross\u2010challenge studies and IEM or solid phase IEM with viruses purified from stool samples [[20], [30], [33], [34], [52], [53]]. Since this could not be done with every new variant that is identified, genome characterization by sequence analysis has been used to provide an interim system of genotyping. As the genotypes ideally would correlate with serotypes, the sequence of the major structural protein gene was used as the basis for phylogenetic analysis. [[89], [90]]. Sequence analyses of viruses from different outbreaks and different geographical locations have confirmed that NLV can be divided into two major genetic groups (termed genogroups) based on capsid sequence and polymerase sequence data [[51], [56], [57], [58]]. NV, Southampton virus, and Desert Shield virus are members of genogroup I. Snow Mountain virus, Hawaii virus, Toronto virus are members of genogroup II. In addition, a highly divergent virus (Alphatron) was assigned to a putative third genogroup. Within genogroups I and II stable lineages have been identified, based on phylogenetic analysis based on the complete capsid gene of at least two representatives per cluster [[85], [91], [92]]. To date, 15 distinct genotypes have been recognized, but as more strains are characterized, this number is likely to increase [[89], [90]].",

Molecular epidemiology has been used on several occasions to confirm (e.g. [[94], [95], [96], [104], [105], [106]]) or disprove links between outbreaks (e.g. [108]).

This may change, however, based on new data for NLV. Until recently, the NLV were considered to be pathogens with humans as the sole host. Recently, however, NLV were found in healthy pigs in Japan and in historic calf stool specimens from the UK and from Germany [[125], [126], [127], [128]]. The calf viruses, named Newbury agent and Jena virus, are pathogenic for young calves. The two bovine enteric caliciviruses and the pig enteric calicivirus are genetically distinct from human strains, but cluster within the NLV genus. In a pilot study in The Netherlands, pooled stool samples from calves, fattening pigs, and adult cows were tested for the presence of NLV [119]. Thirty\u2010three (45%) of the calf herds tested positive for a NLV strains belonging to one cluster, with highest homology with the Newbury genotype. The Netherlands calf viruses were sufficiently distinct to suggest that they may be a separate lineage (based on capsid sequencing). If confirmed, that implies that in calves also several lineages or genotypes of NLV cocirculate, and that zoonotic transmission cannot be excluded by finding distinct strains in animals and humans. In addition, one pig herd was found positive for a virus, which was very similar to the pig calicivirus from Japan [119]. These findings raise important questions on the host range of the NLV. At this stage the animal NLV appear to form genetically distinct stable lineages, but are sufficiently related to the human NLV to suggest that under the right conditions interspecies transmission could occur. Animal caliciviruses in another genus within the family Caliciviridae (the genus vesivirus) have a wide host range, and interspecies transmissions have repeatedly been documented [129].",

The virus is endemic over a wide geographic area, primarily in countries with inadequate sanitation where HAV is endemic as well (south\u2010east Asia, Indian subcontinent, Africa), but not as widespread as HAV. In industrialized countries HEV infections are rare, and are usually travel\u2010related [[131], [132], [133]]. HEV outbreaks can be distinguished based on the higher attack rate of clinically evident disease in persons 15\u201340 years of age compared with other groups, higher overall case fatality rates (0.5\u20133%), and the unusually high death toll in pregnant women (15\u201320%). In younger age groups, the majority of people with symptoms due to HEV infection may present without jaundice, unlike those infected with HAV [[134], [135], [136]]. Since HEV can cause illness with high mortality in pregnant women, a study of foodborne virus transmission in our opinion should include HEV. The recent discovery that HEV is common in pigs and rats and that pig HEV have been found in humans is reason for a careful evaluation of HEV cases in countries where the virus is not endemic in the human population [[137], [138]]. However, the primary source for HEV infection appears to be fecally contaminated water, and few human cases have been reported in regions where pig HEV is endemic, suggesting that interspecies transmissions of HEV are not common in countries with high standards of living. The subsequent discussion will focus on HAV [[139], [140], [141]].

Paradoxically, as socioeconomic and environmental conditions improve and HAV decreases in endemicity (Fig. 2), the overall incidence and average age of reported cases often increase because older individuals are susceptible and develop symptoms with infection [157]. An illustration of this can been seen from national surveillance data: for instance in England and Wales, the annual notification rate of HAV infection has risen fourfold between 1987 and 1991 from 3.6 to 14.6 per 100 000 population [165]. In Italy, data collected from a surveillance system for type\u2010specific acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA) showed that the incidence of HAV declined from 10/100 000 in 1985 to 2/100 000 during the period 1987\u20131990, while an increase was observed after 1991.

As a result, even with strict sanitary measures, infection may not always be prevented. Foodborne outbreaks have occurred due to contaminated food sources that passed all microbiological assays. A common\u2010sense guideline is to remove people with symptoms consistent with viral gastroenteritis from the production chain until at least 2 days after remission of the symptoms. A practical problem with this guideline is that an unknown proportion of viral infections will be subclinical, viral shedding may last longer, and \u2013 even in the incubation period \u2013 infected persons may shed sufficient amounts of virus to cause food contamination [[42], [123], [171], [177], [178]].

Given the highly infectious nature of NLV and HAV, and the documented risk of virus transmission to food during the incubation period, it is envisioned that guidelines should be developed that consider the occurrence of gastroenteritis in contacts (e.g. children) of people working in critical points in the food chain. This should be based on data on the kinetics of viral shedding following natural infection.

Heating foods (such as shellfish) to temperatures >85\u00b0C for 1 min and disinfecting surfaces with a 1:100 solution of sodium hypochlorite in tap water will inactivate HAV. Little is known about the stability of NLV outside the host, and infectivity can hardly be measured due to the absence of a cell culture system. From experiments with adult volunteers in the 1980s it has been suggested that NV is resistant to low pH (2.7), ether extraction, and heat treatment (30 min at 60\u00b0C) [26].
