The rapid transmission of the causal organism, a coronavirus named SARS Corona Virus [4, 5], led to 8439 cases in 32 countries worldwide with over 800 fatalities. Although most patients presented with respiratory symptoms or fever, isolated or coexisting abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms were not uncommon. The epidemic resulted in the implementation of stringent precautionary measures for patients and particularly hospital staff who were at greatest risk from the contaminated droplets and bodily fluids of their patients.",

Total operative procedures reduced from 182 to 112 (32%), mainly due to a reduction in minor, intermediate and major cases (Fig. 1). Of the 182 operations performed Pre\u2010SARS, 82 (45%) were emergency procedures compared to 63 of 112 operations (56%) during SARS. Cancer resections reduced only from 49 to 41 (16%) during the respective periods. Laparoscopic resection rates were similar (13/49 Pre\u2010SARS vs 7/41 SARS). Before SARS emerged, there were 181 specialist operative episodes and 152 trainee operative episodes. These operative episodes reduced to 143 for specialists and 73 for trainees during SARS, reductions of 21% and 52%, respectively. Operations performed by trainees were supervised by a specialist in 7 of 97 cases (7%) Pre\u2010SARS and in 7 of 39 cases (18%) during SARS. Waiting times for elective minor colorectal operations increased from 11 months to 18 months.",

The dramatic reductions in throughput of cases, with the notable exceptions of cancer resections and major emergency surgery, have had profound effects on the service. The figures for patients awaiting a colorectal clinic appointment do not appear to be dramatic because a preplanned reconfiguration of outpatient services occurred during SARS which saw new routine colorectal cases deflected to another hospital in the region. In many cases, nonurgent surgery was postponed indefinitely to ensure priority was given to those with life\u2010threatening diseases. Consequently, most patients requiring minor or intermediate elective procedures such as haemorrhoidectomy and fistulotomy will wait more than 18 months for surgery.",

Basic surgical trainees suffered most by a drastic reduction in the minor, intermediate and elective cases. Participation in the major cases was discouraged due to the high risk of contracting SARS during operative or endoscopic procedures, while instruction was further hampered by the self\u2010contained ventilation systems used for surgical or endoscopic attire (see Fig. 2). Colonoscopy turnover was further hampered by non\u2013attendance, barrier precautions and prolonged endoscope cycling times, but we have not measured these factors.",
