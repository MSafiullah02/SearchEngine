The patient is a 40-year-old woman who had no baseline comorbidities, her disease course was illustrated in Fig. 1A . She developed fever up to 37.8 C on January 25th without other symptoms. 2 days later, she felt shortness of breath and developed diarrhea, and then went to local hospital. There her nasal swab was obtained, and SARS-CoV2 was tested positive with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting ORF1ab and N gene of virus genome.
