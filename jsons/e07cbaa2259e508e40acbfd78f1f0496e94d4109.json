Less emphasis has been paid to the post-acute healthcare system capacity to manage numerous cardiac patients after COVID-19, i.e. as patients transition from hospital to long-term care facilities or home. In Canada, post-acute cardiac care includes outpatient and inpatient cardiac rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, and nursing homes.",

In the worst-case scenario, which assumes a growth rate of 33% in daily cases (similar to that in Italy), the number of available hospital beds in Ontario could fall to 0 by early-to-mid April 2020, without recovery through mid-May.",

Finally, in a third scenario which assumes an initial 15% daily increase, with a similar subsequent 10.74% decrease, the overall impact would be reduced; however, the timing of patient influx to post-acute care would likely be unchanged.",

Post-acute care facilities will be increasingly challenged by a rising influx of patients with serious, incompletely resolved cardiac problems. Fortunately, as a large country with a significant rural population, Canada has experience with various alternative models for post-acute cardiac care. In fact, several cardiac rehabilitation programs in the country already deliver home-based programs, which have been shown to have similar clinical outcomes, cost, and completion rates compared to clinic-based programs. 9 The maximization of these services, in order to treat patients at home, will be an extremely important component of managing resources during COVID-19. To accomplish this, open communication between cardiac rehabilitation centres will be needed for knowledge exchange, allowing centres not currently offering home-based programs to quickly learn from other centres where this practice has been successfully implemented.",

In the context of this pandemic, telehealth technology can be leveraged to reduce the need for in-person care, for apporopriate patients. Specifically, this technology can be applied to patient follow-up after discharge, to perform remote cardiac monitoring, and to administer cardic rehabilitation curriculums remotely. Digital health interventions -such as the Virtual Care Program from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (https://pwc.ottawaheart.ca/programs-services/virtualcare)-provide services such as self-monitoring tools, reminders, and notifications, as well as peer support groups for those undergoing remote curriculums. Healthcare systems that will leverage these technologies to manage the upcoming influx of patients could see a reduction in in-person care needs and be in a better position to serve their patients. These technologies will play a particularly important role in filling gaps present in areas with limited access to current cardiac rehabilitation care.",
