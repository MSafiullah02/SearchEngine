The constituents of surfactant are phospholipids (80 %), neutral lipids (8 %), and proteins (20 %). Among the phospholipids, the predominant one (60 %) is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), with lesser amounts of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine compounds, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol. The proteins consist of four unique surfactant-associated apoproteins. Two of these, SP-A and SP-D, are hydrophilic proteins and belong to a subgroup of mammalian lectins called collectins. The other two, SP-B and SP-C, are hydrophobic proteins. Surfactant is produced in the type II cells of the alveoli (Fig. 28.1 ) , which differentiate between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation in the human. It is assembled and stored in the lamellar bodies, which are concentric or parallel lamellae of phospholipid bilayers. Lamellar bodies are extruded into the fl uid layer lining the alveoli by exocytosis and form long stacked tubes composed mainly of",

On cross section, tubular myelin has a lattice-like structure because the corners of the component tubes appear fused. Tubular myelin enters the airwater interface quickly by adsorption and greatly reduces the surface tension of that interface (Hallman 2004 ) . It is the major source of the monolayer surface fi lm lining the air-liquid i nterface in the alveoli. In this monolayer the hydrophobic fatty acyl groups of the phospholipids extend into the air, while the hydrophilic polar head groups bind water (Possmayer et al. 1984 ). The total pulmonary surfactant content can be divided into an intra-alveolar and an intracellular pool (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). However, the total surfactant pool size is not equivalent to the amount The composition of lung surfactant is critical to lung function, and the subcellular lamellar body of the type II alveolar cell has a major role in maintaining the composition of surfactant. The distribution of ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter A3 ( ABCA3 ) is shown in red . It is possible that ABCA3 targets surfactant-containing vesicles to the lamellar bodies. The lamellar body is formed through the fusion of several multivesicular bodies, and its lipid bilayers are converted to tubular myelin as they are turned out into the alveolar space. Surfactant protein A, secreted primarily by a constitutive pathway that does not involve the lamellar body, is required for the formation of tubular myelin. Surfactant aggregate, such as tubular myelin, is the precursor of surfactant at the air-water interface ( inset ). Cationic transmembrane proteins (surfactant protein B or surfactant protein C or both (not depicted in the monolayer-multilayer fi lm)) together with anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol or both ( green )) facilitate the entry of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholines ( blue ) into the monolayer at the interface, maintaining a low surface tension. During tidal breathing, tubular myelin surfactant is converted to smaller aggregates that are taken up by type II cells and alveolar macrophages. Arrows depict the direction of surfactant fl ux of active surfactant. Maintaining an adequate intra-alveolar surfactant pool is essential for lung function and is dependent on the dynamic cycle of surfactant metabolism (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). Surfactant pool size increases in late pregnancy, followed by a gradual decrease after birth to adult values (Zimmermann et al. 2005 ) . During and shortly after birth, large amounts of surfactant are released into the alveolar space (Zimmermann et al. 2005 ) . Among different species, humans have the smallest alveolar pool sizes, whereas the amount of saturated phosphatidyl choline in lung tissue is similar across species. The lower alveolar surfactant pool size makes the human lung particularly vulnerable to surfactant dysfunction in case of lung injury. The surfactant pool size in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is around 10 mg/kg or less, while healthy term infants have an estimated surfactant pool size of 100 mg/kg (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). The rate of synthesis of surfactant in preterm infants is also low (Zimmermann et al. 2005 ) .",

Type II cells have beta-adrenergic receptors and respond to beta-agonists with increased surfactant secretion (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). Purines, such as adenosine triphosphate are potent stimulators of surfactant secretion and may be important for its secretion at birth. Mechanical stretch, such as lung distension and hyperventilation, has also been found to be involved in stimulating surfactant secretion (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). Hormones also play a role in surfactant secretion. Thyroxine accelerates type II cell differentiation while acting synergistically with glucocorticoids to enhance lung compliance and DPPC synthesis. Finally, both prenatally administered maternal glucocorticoids and exogenous surfactant administration after birth stimulate endogenous surfactant synthesis.",

In vitro studies (Moses et al. 1991 ; Clark et al. 1987 ) and animal studies (Sun et al. 1993 ; Davey et al. 1993 ) have demonstrated that meconium inhibits surfactant function and is likely to be partially responsible for alveolar collapse in meconium aspiration syndrome. Components of meconium that may contribute to altered surfactant function include cholesterol, free fatty acids, bile salts, bilirubin, and proteolytic enzymes (Moses et al. 1991 ; Clark et al. 1987 ; Sun et al. 1993 ; Lieberman 1966 ) . In particular, phospholipase-A2 (PLA2) in meconium has been found to inhibit the activity of surfactant in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, through the competitive displacement of surfactant from the alveolar fi lm (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). PLA2 is also known to induce hydrolysis of DPPC, releasing free fatty acids and lyso-PC which damage the alveolar-capillary membrane and induce intrapulmonary sequestration of neutrophils (Nkadi et al. 2009 ).",

ALI/ARDS is characterized by sudden onset, impaired gas exchange, decreased static compliance, and a nonhydrostatic pulmonary edema (Nkadi et al. 2009 ). ARDS is characterized by an increase in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier due to injury to the endothelium and/or alveolar lining cells. Damage to the alveolar type I cells leads to an infl ux of protein-rich edema fl uid into the alveoli, as well as decreased fl uid clearance from the alveolar space. Neutrophils are attracted into the airways by host bacterial and chemotactic factors and express enzymes and cytokines which further damage the alveolar epithelial cells (Nkadi et al. 2009 ).

When a bolus of surfactant is instilled and propagates down the airways, it deposits a liquid layer that coats the airways. The bolus may rupture because it may not pick up as much fl uid as it is depositing and therefore may not reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli where it is needed. However, the deposited liquid layer that is left behind may still advance due to the effects of gravity and surface tension, especially as the liquid layer thins. The potential magnitude of uneven distribution of exogenously administered surfactant has been emphasized by Jobe ( 2006 ) , who points out that there are 20 generations of airway branching from the trachea to the respiratory bronchioles and saccules, with 250,000 binary branch points and 500,000 distal airways leading to saccules. If the distribution is not proportionate to the number of saccules beyond each branch point, surfactant distribution will not be uniform. Any nonuniformity at a proximal branch point will be amplifi ed at subsequent branch points. When exogenous surfactant is administered in clinical practice, its distribution is not ideal, but is often good enough because of the biophysical properties of surfactant and the small amount that is needed regionally in the lung for a treatment response (Jobe 2006 ). No neonatal studies were available at time of publication; the displayed details of dosing were obtained from studies on animals and in adult patients (Spragg et al. 2004 ; Hilgendorff et al. 2006 ) There are several variables that contribute to the distribution of surfactant in the lungs (Jobe 2006 ) : surface activity causes rapid adsorption and spreading, gravity contributes to the distribution of surfactant in large airways, a higher volume of surfactant and faster administration cause better distribution, positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure help clear the airways of fl uid, and higher volumes of fetal lung fl uid or edema fl uid improve distribution. Therefore techniques to improve surfactant distribution include positioning the infant to minimize gravity, giving surfactant quickly in a reasonable volume, and giving the infant enough ventilator support to quickly clear the airways of fl uid.",

In another small clinical trial of preterm infants (Zola et al. 1993b ) , there were no differences in clinical outcomes with administration by bolus versus slow infusion.

All these trials used animal-derived surfactant preparations. Trials varied whether surfactant was given before or after the onset of air breathing (pre-or post-ventilatory administration), but all administered surfactant before 15 min of age. The average time of administration of surfactant in the selective treatment groups ranged from 1.5 to 7.4 h. The results of the meta-analysis of the eight trials from a systematic review (Soll and Morley 2012 ) (Soll 2001) prophylactic administration compared to selective administration were of greater magnitude. The meta-analysis demonstrates that compared to selective administration, prophylactic administration of animal-derived surfactant to infants less than 30 weeks gestation resulted in a greater reduction in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.49-0.78; typical ARD \u22120.06, 95 % CI \u22120.09 to \u22120.03) and a reduction in the combined outcome of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death (typical RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.77-0.97; typical ARD \u22120.05, 95 % CI \u22120.09 to \u22120.01). Preventilatory Versus Post-ventilatory Prophylactic Surfactant Administration : The initial studies using prophylactic surfactant administered the drug as an immediate bolus after intubating the infants rapidly after birth (i.e., \"before the fi rst breath\"). This approach delays the initiation of neonatal resuscitation, including positive pressure ventilation, and is associated with a risk for surfactant delivery into the right main stem bronchus or esophagus. A randomized trial demonstrated that prophylaxis may be administered in small aliquots soon after resuscitation and confi rmation of endotracheal tube position, with equivalent or greater effi cacy (Kendig et al. 1998 ). Based on this trial, prophylactic surfactant should be administered after initial resuscitation of the infant at birth and administration prior to the \"fi rst breath\" is unnecessary.",

            "text": "The trials mentioned above comparing the use of prophylactic surfactant to surfactant treatment of established RDS were all performed in an era when the use of maternal antenatal glucocorticoids was not as high as in the current era, where 90 % or more of mothers who deliver prematurely receive antenatal glucocorticoids. Also, in these trials, surfactant in the \"rescue\" group was given relatively late, between 1.5 and 7.4 h, after birth. There are no trials comparing the effects of prophylactic intubation and surfactant administration shortly after birth to infants at high risk of RDS (with intubation primarily performed to administer surfactant) to very early selective administration (e.g., at 30-60 min of life) in intubated infants with early RDS or respiratory insuffi ciency. Therefore, in current practice, the benefi ts of prophylactic surfactant demonstrated in these trials might not be as large. A strategy of surfactant prophylaxis subjects infants without RDS to unnecessary intubation and surfactant administration and also to the risk of ventilatorinduced lung injury (Clark et al. 2001 ) (although admittedly some of these infants without RDS may still require intubation and ventilation for respiratory failure not due to RDS). In recent years, prophylactic surfactant administration to preterm infants at risk of RDS has been compared with the use of nasal CPAP (and attempting to avoid mechanical ventilation) as the primary method of respiratory management at birth. These studies are discussed in the next section. In the SUPPORT trial (SUPPORT Study Group of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network 2010 ), infants 24-27 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to intubation and surfactant treatment (within 1 h after birth) or to CPAP treatment initiated in the delivery room, with subsequent use of a \"protocoldriven limited ventilation strategy.\" The primary outcome, death, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defi ned as supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post-menstrual age) did not differ signifi cantly between the CPAP group and the surfactant group (47.8 and 51.0 %, respectively; RR with CPAP, 0.95; 95 % CI, 0.85-1.05) after adjustment for gestational age, center, and familial clustering. The results were similar when bronchopulmonary dysplasia was defi ned according to the need for any supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks (rates of primary outcome, 48.7 and 54.1 %, respectively; RR with CPAP, 0.91; 95 % CI, 0.83-1.01). Infants who received CPAP treatment, as compared with infants who received surfactant treatment, less frequently required intubation or postnatal corticosteroids for bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( P < 0.001), required fewer days of mechanical ventilation ( P = 0.03), and were more likely to be alive and free from the need for mechanical ventilation by day 7 ( P = 0.01). In secondary analyses, among infants 24 and 25 weeks gestation, there was a signifi cant reduction in the risk of death in the CPAP group, as compared with the early-intubation group. The rate of death during hospitalization was 24 % versus 32 %, RR with CPAP, 0.74; 95 % CI 0.57-0.98. The rate of death at 36 weeks was 20 % versus 29 %, RR, 0.68; 95 % CI 0.5-0.92.",

This approach can avoid unnecessary intubation, unnecessary surfactant administration, and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, while reducing healthcare costs and resource utilization. However, clinicians should closely monitor infants initially stabilized on CPAP to identify infants who have progressive respiratory failure, so that infants who require surfactant can be intubated and given surfactant as early as possible. Clinicians should also use information available prior to the birth of the infant to identify infants who are not likely to do well with initial stabilization on nasal CPAP, such as infants born to mothers who have not received antenatal glucocorticoids.",

Six randomized controlled clinical trials addressed this question and are summarized in a systematic review (Stevens Timothy et al. 2007 ). The rapid (within one hour) extubation attempted in these trials contrasts with the traditional approach -developed when surfactant therapy was fi rst used -of keeping an infant on mechanical ventilation after surfactant administration, weaning ventilator support gradually as the pulmonary status improved, and extubating the infant from low ventilator settings. This approach of rapid extubation followed immediately by the use of nasal CPAP has been called \"INSURE\" (INtubate, SURfactant, Extubate to CPAP) and is intended to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury than can result from even brief periods of mechanical ventilation (Donn and Sinha 2006 ; Schmolzer et al. 2008 ) . The six randomized trials, all of which are trials of \"rescue\" surfactant administration, are summarized in a systematic review (Stevens Timothy et al. 2007 ) . Most of these studies included infants with a gestation of 35 weeks and below and a birth weight of 2,500 g and below. Many of the infants in these studies were between 32 and 35 weeks (few were extremely premature). In these studies of infants with signs and symptoms of RDS, intubation and early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to nasal CPAP (NCPAP) compared with later selective surfactant administration was associated with a lower incidence of mechanical ventilation ( (Rojas et al. 2009 ), infants 27-31 weeks gestation with RDS who were randomly assigned within the fi rst hour of life either to intubation, very early surfactant, extubation, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure required less ventilation and had a lower incidence of mortality and air leaks (pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema) than infants assigned to nasal continuous airway pressure alone. These data suggest that for a preterm infant with RDS who is not on mechanical ventilation (and is being managed on CPAP or an oxygen hood), early intubation at a low FiO 2 threshold (FiO 2 < 0.45), surfactant administration, and rapid extubation to CPAP decreases the risk of needing mechanical ventilation, BPD, and air leak syndrome, although it results in more surfactant use. Whether the same INSURE approach should be followed when prophylactic surfactant therapy is used is not clear due to lack of evidence.",

Therefore preterm infants who do not receive prophylactic surfactant and subsequently develop clinical features of RDS should receive the fi rst dose of surfactant as early as possible. Outborn infants are at highest risk of delayed administration. Tertiary referral units accepting outborn infants should attempt to develop systems to ensure that surfactant is administered as early as possible to these infants, either by the transporting team or, if appropriate, by the referring hospital. In inborn infants, delays in administration of surfactant occur if other admission procedures such as line placement, radiographs, and nursing procedures are allowed to take precedence over surfactant dosing soon after birth. Surfactant administration should be given priority over such admission procedures.",

However, surfactant may become rapidly metabolized and functional inactivation of surfactant can result from the action of soluble proteins and other factors in the small airways and alveoli (Jobe and Ikegami 1993 ) . Administering repeat doses of surfactant can overcome such inactivation. The results of two randomized controlled trials (Yost and Soll 2000 ) that compared multiple dosing regimens to single-dose regimens of animal-derived surfactant extract for treatment of established respiratory distress syndrome (Dunn et al. 1990 ; have been evaluated in a systematic review (Soll and \u00d6zek 2009 ) . In one study (Dunn et al. 1990 ), after the initial dose of bovine lipid extract surfactant, infants assigned to the multiple-dose group could receive up to three additional doses during the fi rst 72 h of life if they had a respiratory deterioration, provided they had shown a positive response to the fi rst dose and a pneumothorax had been eliminated as the cause of the respiratory deterioration. In the other study , infants in the multiple-dose group received additional doses of poractant at 12 and 24 h after the initial dose if they still needed supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 70 % of the infants randomized to the multiple-dose regimen received multiple doses. The meta-analysis supports a decreased risk of pneumothorax associated with multiple dose surfactant therapy (typical RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.30-0.88; typical ARD \u22120.09, 95 % CI \u22120.15 to \u22120.02). There was also a trend towards decreased mortality (typical RR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.39-1.02; typical ARD \u22120.07, 95 % CI \u22120.14 to 0.00). No differences were detected in other clinical outcomes. No complications associated with multiple-dose treatment were reported in these trials. In a third study, in which protein-free synthetic surfactant was used in a prophylactic manner, the use of two doses of surfactant in addition to a prophylactic dose lead to a decrease in mortality, respiratory support, necrotizing enterocolitis, and other outcomes when compared to a single prophylactic dose (Corbet et al. 1995 ) . In the OSIRIS trial, which used protein-free synthetic surfactant, a two-dose treatment schedule was found to be equivalent to a treatment schedule permitting up to four doses of surfactant.",

Again, there were minor short-term benefi ts to using a low threshold with no differences in major clinical outcomes. However, in a subgroup of infants with respiratory distress syndrome complicated by perinatal compromise or infection, infants in the high-threshold group had a trend towards higher mortality than the low-threshold group.

Within some multicenter trials, signifi cant differences in outcomes of surfactanttreated infants have been noted between participating hospitals (Collaborative European Multicentre Study Group 1991 ; Herting et al. 1992 ) , suggesting that variations in patient care practices have an important infl uence on the outcomes of surfactant-treated infants.",

            "text": "Transient hypoxia and bradycardia can occur due to acute airway obstruction immediately following surfactant instillation (Zola et al. 1993a ; Liechty et al. 1991 ) . Other acute adverse effects of surfactant administration include refl ux of surfactant into the pharynx from the endotracheal tube, increase in transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension, tachycardia, gagging, and mucous plugging of the endotracheal tube. These complications of surfactant administration generally respond to a slower rate of surfactant administration or to an increased airway pressure or FiO 2 during administration. Rapid improvement in oxygenation after surfactant administration necessitates close monitoring and appropriate reduction of ventilatory parameters. Several authors have reported a transient decrease in blood pressure (Hellstrom-Westas et al. 1992 ; Skov et al. 1992a , b ) , a transient decrease in cerebral blood fl ow velocity (Cowan et al. 1991 ; Murdoch and Kempley 1998 ; Edwards et al. 1992 ), a transient decrease in cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentration (Edwards et al. 1992 ) , and a transient decrease in cerebral activity on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (Hellstrom-Westas et al. 1992 ) immediately after surfactant administration. The EEG depression observed after surfactant instillation is not caused by cerebral ischemia (Bell et al. 1994 ) , and the EEG suppression is not directly related to alterations in blood gases or systemic circulation (Lundstrom and Greisen 1996 ) . The clinical signifi cance of these fi ndings is uncertain. One study (Horbar et al. 1990 ) reported an increase in the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and a case report documents a temporal association between the development of intraventricular hemorrhage and the administration of surfactant-TA to improve respiratory failure caused by pulmonary hemorrhage (Funato et al. 1992 ). However, the meta-analyses of multiple trials do not show an increase in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage with surfactant therapy compared to placebo (Seger and Soll 2009 ; Soll 1998 ; Soll and \u00d6zek 1997 , 2010 ) .",

Although trials in which animal-derived surfactants were used reported a higher incidence (5-6 %) of pulmonary hemorrhage than trials of protein-free synthetic surfactant (1-3 %), direct comparison demonstrates no difference in the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. The overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was low and the absolute magnitude of the increased risk is small (Raju and Langenberg 1993 ) . However, moderate and severe pulmonary hemorrhage is associated with an increased risk of death and short-term morbidity. It is not associated with increased long-term morbidity (Pandit et al. 1999 ).The occurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage may be related to the presence of a hemodynamically signifi cant patent ductus arteriosus (Garland et al. 1994 ). Seppanen et al. studied the association of neonatal complications with the Dopplerderived aortopulmonary pressure gradient (APPG) across the ductus arteriosus, which refl ects pulmonary artery pressure during the fi rst day of life. Infants in whom the APPG decreased after birth had a lower frequency of patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary hemorrhage than those whose APPG remained low (Seppanen et al. 1995 ) . Another mechanism for the pulmonary hemorrhage may be a direct cytotoxicity, which has been demonstrated in in vitro studies and appears to be different for different surfactants and different dosages (Findlay et al. 1995 ) .",

For both protein-free synthetic and animalderived surfactant, the \"long-term\" outcomes reported consist of outcomes predominantly in the fi rst 3 years of life, with very few reports of outcomes at school age or higher. Given these limitations, the evidence suggests that not only do more infants survive from surfactant therapy but they are also at no selective disadvantage for neurodevelopmental sequelae due to the surfactant therapy. Most comparisons of long-term outcomes have been between infants treated with surfactant and placebo. There are few or no comparisons of long-term outcomes between infants treated with different types of surfactant or different regimens of the same surfactant.

The meta-analysis of these four trials (El Shahed et al. 2007 ) showed a decreased need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with surfactant therapy (typical RR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.46-0.91; typical ARD \u22120.17, 95 % CI \u22120.30 to \u22120.04).

Therefore, surfactant replacement has been proposed as a treatment for patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which, although more common in adults and older children, can occur in term neonates (Faix et al. 1989 ; Pfenninger et al. 1991 ) . Exogenous surfactant therapy has been attempted in ARDS in adults but the results of clinical trials have not been promising (Anzueto et al. 1996 ; Gregory et al. 1997a ). There are no randomized trials of exogenous surfactant therapy specifi cally for ARDS in neonates, but in older children with acute respiratory failure, surfactant use decreased mortality and duration of ventilation (Willson et al. 1999 ; Duffett et al. 2007 ). Because of this, and based on the pathophysiologic, clinical, and radiologic similarities between RDS and ARDS, it is reasonable to provide exogenous surfactant therapy to term infants with clinical and radiologic features of ARDS (severe respiratory failure with pulmonary opacifi cation and air bronchograms on chest radiographs). The use of surfactant in ARDS is discussed in detail in Sect. 28.2 .",

The studies of both Robillard et al. in 1964 Robillard et al. in ( 1964 and Chu et al. in 1967 Chu et al. in ( 1967 tried unsuccessfully to treat infants with established IRDS (called hyaline membrane disease at the time) using aerosolized DPPC. The failure of this initial \"surfactant replacement therapy,\" together with a small but apparently positive physiological response to pulmonary vasodilatation, led to the erroneous conclusion that IRDS was due to ischemia and that surfactant defi ciency was the result and not the cause of this disease (Chu et al. 1965 (Chu et al. , 1967 . This misinterpretation was widely accepted until Enhorning and colleagues (Enhorning et al. 1973a , b ) in 1973 demonstrated that whole surfactant isolated from adult rabbits could induce near-normal gas exchange when instilled into the trachea of premature rabbit pups, documenting that their respiratory failure was caused by surfactant defi ciency. Moreover, it was not until 1981 that Fujiwara et al. (Fujiwara 1981 ) reported positive responses in respiratory function in human infants treated with a bovine-derived exogenous lung surfactant. We now understand that pulmonary surfactant is more than just DPPC, and that multiple lipid and peptide components are required for full activity. It is also now appreciated that the attempts of Robillard et al. ( 1964 ) and Chu et al. ( 1967 ) to aerosolize DPPC were not effective in delivering adequate amounts of material to the alveoli. Intratracheal instillation of exogenous surfactants in aqueous suspension is the current standard of care for the treatment and prevention of IRDS.",

It has been known for some time that endogenous surfactant becomes dysfunctional in many forms of acute infl ammatory lung injury, providing a direct conceptual rationale for exogenous surfactant supplementation. Despite this rationale, initial controlled studies attempting to treat adults with ARDS with exogenous surfactants were unsuccessful (Anzueto et al. 1996 ; Gregory et al. 1997b ) and prompted calls for abandoning further clinical trials (Matthay 1996 ) . However, the exogenous surfactants used in these studies (Anzueto et al. 1996 ; Gregory et al. 1997b ) lacked one or more highly active components found in native surfactant, and the patients had sepsisinduced ARDS that involved substantial extrapulmonary pathology. Other studies of exogenous surfactant therapy in patients with ALI/ARDS give reason for cautious optimism about the use of this intervention, particularly in the case of direct pulmonary forms of these syndromes.

            "text": "Unlike IRDS, surfactant defi ciency is not a major factor in most forms of ALI/ARDS. Instead, surfactant dysfunction (inactivation, inhibition) induced by infl ammatory lung injury is an important contributor to pathophysiology. In ALI/ ARDS, an initially functional pulmonary surfactant system becomes \"collateral damage\" during whatever primary process injures the lung. Surfactant dysfunction can occur whether the cause of lung injury originates on the alveolar side of the epithelium (so-called direct lung injury such as from aspiration, pulmonary bacterial or viral infection, pulmonary oxygen toxicity) or from the vascular side (\"indirect\" or \"extrapulmonary\" lung injury, such as in association with sepsis, shock, fatty acid release from long bone fracture or pancreatitis, burn injury, multiple blood transfusions). During both direct and indirect lung injury, initially active surfactant can be rendered dysfunctional by one of several mechanisms (Fig. 28 .5 ) (Jobe and Ikegami 1998b ; Notter and Wang 1997 ; Wang et al. 2005a ; Notter 2000 ) : 1. Inhibition of surfactant biophysical function by plasma proteins (Holm et al. 1985 ; Seeger et al. 1985a Seeger et al. , b , 1993 Holm and Notter 1987 ; Holm et al. 1988 ; Fuchimukai et al. 1987 ; Keough et al. 1989 ; Wang and Notter 1998 ; ) or other blood components such as fatty acids (Wang and Notter 1998 ; Seeger et al. 1985b ; Hall et al. 1990 Hall et al. , 1992b Hall et al. , 1994 Holm et al. 1999 ) that leak into the alveolar space as a result of alveolocapillary membrane injury and decreased barrier integrity 2. Alterations in alveolar surfactant aggregates whereby the most active \"large aggregate\" forms of surfactant are reduced in activity and/or percent content, while less active \"small aggregate\" forms of surfactant become more prevalent (Wang et al. 2005a ; Hall et al. 1994 ; Davidson et al. 2005 ; Russo et al. 2002 Russo et al. , 2007 Wright et al. 2001 Fig. 28 .5 Schematic diagram illustrating pathways that can contribute to surfactant dysfunction in acute infl ammatory pulmonary injury. Initiators of lung injury can act initially either from the alveolar side (\"direct\" lung injury) or from the vascular side (\"indirect\" or \"extrapulmonary\" lung injury). However, both direct and indirect etiologies of injury induce pulmonary infl ammation, alveolocapillary membrane injury, permeability edema, and reactive vasoconstriction or related vascular dysfunction. Surfactant dysfunction can occur by multiple mechanisms in the injured lungs, as shown in the fi gure and described in the text. The resulting loss of surface-active function contributes to acute respiratory failure with decreased lung volumes, decreased compliance, and severe ventilation/perfusion mismatching (Adapted from Wang et al. ( 2005a )) et G\u00fcnther et al. 1996 ; Veldhuizen et al. 1995 ) 3. Inhibition and/or chemical alteration of components in the alveolar surfactant fi lm induced by cell membrane lipids Wang and Notter 1998 ; Holm et al. 1999 ; Cockshutt and Possmayer 1991 ; Wang et al. 2005b Wang et al. , 2008 , meconium (Moses et al. 1991 ) , or other substances present during the innate pulmonary infl ammatory response such as proteases (Pison et al. 1989a ), phospholipases Enhorning et al. 1992 ; Wang et al. 2007 ), or reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species (Seeger et al. 1985b ; Hickman-Davis et al. 2001 ; Haddad et al. 1993 ; Amirkhanian and Merritt 1998 ) 4. An altered synthesis, secretion, or composition of active surfactant due to injury-induced changes in alveolar type II pneumocytes, which are stem cells for the alveolar epithelium in addition to being the primary cells of lung surfactant metabolism (Finkelstein 1990 ; Finkelstein et al. 1992 ; Mason et al. 1977 ; Mason and Williams 1997 ) Abnormalities in surfactant composition and/ or activity have been well documented in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with many forms of ALI/ARDS e.g., (G\u00fcnther et al. 1996 ; Veldhuizen et al. 1995 ; Seeger et al. 1990 ; Pison et al. 1989b ; Gregory et al. 1991 ; Griese 1999 ; Schmidt et al. 2007 ; Greene et al. 1999 ) . Regardless of etiology, the practical consequences of surfactant dysfunction in ALI/ARDS are not dissimilar to those found in IRDS. As a result of decreased surfactant activity, the lungs become less compliant, with a progressive loss of aerated volume and an increased mismatching of ventilation with perfusion. Hypoxia, respiratory failure, and the need for respiratory support then ensue. In addition to surfactant dysfunction, ALI/ ARDS also involves pulmonary infl ammation and vascular dysfunction that can signifi cantly impact overall patient outcomes and responses to therapy. Moreover, systemic infl ammation and multiorgan (extrapulmonary) pathology are prominent in \"indirect\" forms of ALI/ARDS. The complex pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS is reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Bernard et al. 1994 ; Ware and Matthay 2000 ; Knight and Rotta 2005 ; Artigas et al. 1998 ; Krafft et al. 1996 ; Rubenfeld et al. 2005 ; Raghavendran et al. 2008b ; DeBruin et al. 1992 ; Flori et al. 2005 ) .",

Surfactant dysfunction, and hence surfactant replacement, is most important mechanistically in the acute exudative phase of ALI/ARDS. However, lung injury can progress to more chronic fi broproliferative and fi brotic stages, including superimposed effects from iatrogenic barotrauma, volutrauma, or atelectrauma induced by mechanical ventilation (\"ventilator induced lung injury,\" VILI) (Dos Santos and Slutsky 2000 ; Ricard et al. 2001 ; The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network 2000 ; Pelosi and Negrini 2008 ) . The presence of evolving lung injury, together with infl ammation and other non-surfactant factors in the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS, complicates assessments of the long-term effi cacy of exogenous surfactant therapy. Even if acute surfactant dysfunction is reversed effectively, long-term therapeutic benefi ts may not be apparent due to the presence of other aspects of disease. The long-term effi cacy of surfactant therapy also depends on the specifi c activity of the exogenous surfactant used, the method of surfactant delivery, and almost certainly other variables that remain to be elucidated.",

Importantly, these studies also document that inhibitor-induced inactivation can be overcome by raising surfactant concentration. The ability of exogenous surfactant supplementation to overcome inhibition in vitro is not only a function of surfactant concentration but also depends on the content of essential apoproteins, particularly surfactant protein (SP)-B. Exogenous surfactants with higher contents of SP-B generally have greater activity and better inhibition resistance than those with little or no SP-B (Fig. 28.6 ). This is particularly relevant clinically, because the two major surfactant drugs studied unsuccessfully in the 1990s in controlled trials in adults with ARDS contained either no SP-B (Exosurf \u00ae ) (Anzueto et al. 1996 ) or minimal levels of SP-B (Survanta \u00ae ) (Gregory et al. 1997b ).",

            "text": "The effects of exogenous surfactant replacement have been studied in a large number of animal models of acute pulmonary injury (ALI/ARDS). Animal studies of acute injury most commonly examine responses to therapy over a timescale of hours, although some (e.g., hyperoxia) can address effects over longer times. Animal studies of acute pulmonary injury offer limited insight into long-term effi cacy and the mitigation of chronic pathology, but are essential in providing a direct measure of the effectiveness of exogenous surfactants in mitigating injuryinduced surfactant dysfunction and associated acute respiratory failure. Data from animal experiments on surfactant therapy have given insights into optimal preparations and delivery methods and are reassuring with regard to safety. Selected fi ndings relating to exogenous surfactants and their effi cacy in animal models of lung injury include the following (see Refs (Wang et al. 2005a ; Notter 2000 ) for further review of animal studies of surfactant therapy in ALI/ ARDS): Type of lung injury : \"Direct\" lung injuries in animal models such as saline lavage (Lachmann et al. 1983 ; Kobayashi et al. 1984 ; Berggren et al. 1986 ; Lewis et al. 1996 ; Walther et al. 1997 Walther et al. , 1998 , acid aspiration (Kobayashi et al. 1990 ; Zucker et al. 1992 ; Schlag and Strohmaier 1993 ) , viral infection (van Daal et al. 1991 (van Daal et al. , 1992 , or hyperoxic injury (Matalon et al. 1987 (Matalon et al. , 1988 Loewen et al. 1989 ; Engstrom et al. 1989 ; Novotny et al. 1995 ) have been shown to respond well to the instillation of active exogenous surfactants. In contrast, signifi cant benefi ts from surfactant replacement have not been documented in animal models of \"indirect\" lung injuries from systemic sepsis or intravenous oleic acid administration. Exogenous surfactants that most closely mimic natural surfactant (CLSE/Infasurf \u00ae and Alveofact \u00ae ) are best able to resist inhibition and reach low surface tensions despite high levels of inhibitory proteins. Clinical exogenous surfactants are described and categorized in more detail in a subsequent section. Surfactant concentration for all preparations shown was uniform at 2 mg/ml (Data are from Seeger et al. ( 1993 ) as adapted by Notter ( 2000 )) Type of surfactant : Surfactant preparations containing high levels of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C are more effective physiologically than protein-free synthetic surfactants. Additionally, SP-B is known to have greater effi cacy than SP-C in enhancing biophysical and physiological activity in exogenous surfactant mixtures (Curstedt et al. 1987 ; Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis et al. 1991a Revak et al. 1988 ; Seeger et al. 1992 ; Wang et al. 1996 Wang et al. , 2002 Yu and Possmayer 1988 ; Notter et al. 2002 ) , and supplementation with purifi ed SP-B or synthetic SP-B peptides increases the activity of surfactants that contain SP-C in animal models of surfactant replacement (Walther et al. 1997 ; Notter et al. 2002 ; Mizuno et al. 1995 ) . Timing of administration : Early as opposed to late administration of exogenous surfactant has the most potential effi cacy in ALI/ARDS for several reasons: (a) a better distribution of exogenous surfactant is possible because lung injury is more homogeneous early on; (b) early surfactant administration can help to moderate subsequent ventilator-induced lung injury; and (c) surfactant defi ciency/dysfunction is most pronounced, and can be most specifi cally targeted, early in the course of lung injury. The benefi ts of early exogenous surfactant therapy have previously been documented clinically in premature infants (Bevilacqua et al. 1996 ; Kattwinkel et al. 1993 ; Kendig et al. 1998 Kendig et al. , 1991 OSIRIS Collaborative Group 1992 ) . Method of delivery : Delivery of exogenous surfactants by direct airway instillation has been found to be more effective than aerosolization (Notter 2000 ; Lewis et al. 1991 Lewis et al. , 1993a . Despite the theoretical advantages of aerosolization, it has proven diffi cult to deliver adequate amounts of surfactant to the alveoli using current technology. Also, aerosolized surfactant tends to go where inspired gas goes and consequently may not reach and recruit poorly aerated lung regions effectively (Lewis et al. 1993a , b ) . Other variables : The effi cacy of exogenous surfactants can also be affected by the method or mode of mechanical ventilation (Van Kaam et al. 2004 ) , dosage amount and concentration, surfactant viscosity (King et al. 2002 ) , rate of delivery, and other physical variables. Further animal studies, however, are necessary in order to study these variables systematically.",

Endogenous lung surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids (primarily phospholipids) and specifi c apoproteins that is highly conserved across mammalian species (Table 28 .2 ). The degree of resemblance of native surfactant to pharmaceutical surfactants is highly variable, and the latter can be divided into three functionally relevant groups (Notter 2000 ; Notter and Wang 2008 ; Chess et al. 2005 ) : I. Organic solvent extracts of lavaged lung surfactant from animals ( Alveofact \u00ae , BLES \u00ae ; Infasurf \u00ae ) II. Organic solvent extracts of processed animal lung tissue with or without additional synthetic additives ( Curosurf \u00ae ; Survanta \u00ae or Surfactant -TA \u00ae ) III. Synthetic preparations not containing surfactant material from animal lungs ( ALEC ; Exosurf \u00ae ; Surfaxin \u00ae ; Venticute \u00ae ) Surfactants in Categories I and II are sometimes classifi ed together as \"animal-derived\" or \"natural\" surfactant preparations. However, clinical surfactants in Category I have the closest compositional analogy to endogenous surfactant because they are obtained directly from recovered alveolar lavage fl uid. Category I surfactant preparations in principle contain all the surfactant phospholipids plus the two hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C in close approximation to the natural ratio (the hydrophilic surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D are removed by organic solvent extraction in all Category I and Category II surfactants). Surfactant preparations in Category II also contain surfactant phospholipids and one or both of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins, but in addition they potentially contain constituents such as cellular lipids and/or hydrophobic fragments of cellular proteins because they are derived from processed lung tissue.",

Two early protein-free synthetic surfactants (ALEC and Exosurf \u00ae ) are now no longer used because their activity is signifi cantly less than existing animal-derived surfactants. Two newer synthetic surfactants are Surfaxin \u00ae (KL4) and Venticute \u00ae (recombinant SP-C surfactant). However, the 21 amino acid KL4 peptide in Surfaxin \u00ae has only very approximate molecular analogy to native SP-B, and Venticute \u00ae contains no SP-B peptide. Thus, the development of more optimal fully synthetic surfactants with a highly active SP-B peptide component with or without added novel lipids that can resist phospholipase-induced degradation in lung injury is an active area of investigation (Notter 2000 ; Wang et al. 2003 Wang et al. , 2007 Notter and Wang 2008 ; Notter et al. 2007 ) . Synthetic lung surfactants have signifi cant potential advantages in purity, manufacturing, quality control, scale-up, and cost relative to animal-derived preparations Notter et al. 2007 ) . Synthetic surfactants are also free from animal pathogens like prions, and they are not subject to cultural or religious issues that can affect bovine-or porcine-derived preparations. Simple dosage calculations illustrate the potential practical importance of synthetic surfactants in ALI/ARDS, since drug amounts 50-100 times larger than those used in premature infants are required in adults and older children to achieve an equivalent dose normalized by body weight. The dollar expense of surfactant therapy in adult patients will be extremely high unless drug costs per unit weight can be reduced substantially from the current price of 100-200 mg infant vials of animal-derived surfactants. Synthetic surfactant production involves no animal costs, and chemical manufacturing methods can theoretically be scaled-up and quality controlled much more efficiently to allow more cost-effective therapy of ALI/ARDS.",

To treat severe acute infl ammatory lung injury, exogenous surfactants must have the greatest possible activity and resistance to inhibition or inactivation. Specifi c differences in composition among clinical exogenous lung surfactants are a major factor in predicting and interpreting their clinical efficacy. For example, the protein-free exogenous surfactant Exosurf \u00ae has some activity in treating IRDS (Bose et al. 1990 ; Corbet et al. 1991 ; Long et al. 1991a , b ) , but it is signifi cantly less effi cacious in premature infants than apoproteincontaining animal surfactants like Infasurf \u00ae (Hudak et al. 1996 (Hudak et al. , 1997 Notter 2000 ) , and it has no clinical benefi ts in adults with ARDS (Anzueto et al. 1996 ) . Similarly, Survanta \u00ae has been found to have minimal benefi ts in adults with sepsisinduced ARDS (Gregory et al. 1997b ) , which correlates with its very low content of active SP-B (Seeger et al. 1993 ; Mizuno et al. 1995 ; Hamvas et al. 1994 ) . At the same time, Survanta \u00ae has signifi cant activity due to its content of SP-C , and it is effi cacious in treating premature infants with IRDS as well as term infants with acute respiratory failure from meconium aspiration lung injury as detailed later (Khammash et al. 1993 ; Lotze et al. 1993 Lotze et al. , 1998 Findlay et al. 1996 ) .",

Knock-out mice with isolated SP-B defi ciency die shortly after birth of respiratory failure (Clark et al. 1995 ) , and human infants with SP-B mutations do not survive beyond the fi rst days of life without surfactant replacement (and ultimately lung transplant) (Hamvas et al. 1994 (Hamvas et al. , 1995 (Hamvas et al. , 1997 Whitsett et al. 1995 ). An elegant series of experiments by Ikegami et al. ( 2005 ) using a conditional knock-out mouse model demonstrated that adult mice rendered acutely defi cient in SP-B develop severe respiratory distress with evidence of surfactant dysfunction and pulmonary infl ammation. Mice left SP-B defi cient died with pathology resembling ARDS, but the abnormalities were reversed and the mice survived if SP-B synthesis was restored. Interestingly, these mice maintained normal levels of the SP-C protein during study (Ikegami et al. 2005 ) .",

            "text": "Multiple clinical studies have reported measurable benefi ts following the instillation of active exogenous surfactants to term newborns, children, or adults with ALI/ARDS or lung injury-related acute respiratory failure (Auten et al. 1991 ; Khammash et al. 1993 ; Lotze et al. 1993 Lotze et al. , 1998 Findlay et al. 1996 ; Willson et al. 1996 Willson et al. , 1999 Willson et al. , 2005 Gunther et al. 2002 ; Walmrath et al. 1996 Walmrath et al. , 2002 Spragg et al. 1994 ; Wiswell et al. 1999 ; Lopez-Herce et al. 1999 ; Hermon et al. 2002 ; Herting et al. 2002 ; Luchetti et al. 1998 Luchetti et al. , 2002 Moller et al. 2003 ; Amital et al. 2008 ) (Table 28. 3 ). However, while a number of these have been controlled trials, many have been uncontrolled pilot studies or case series that reported signifi cant improvements primarily in acute lung function (arterial oxygenation). Moreover, as noted earlier, two large controlled trials not included in the positive studies in Table 28 .3 either showed no benefi t (Anzueto et al. 1996 ) or minimal benefi ts (Gregory et al. 1997b ) from surfactant therapy in adults with sepsis-induced ARDS. A more detailed summary of the clinical experience with surfactant therapy in term infants, children and adults with ALI/ ARDS follows below. Perhaps the best-studied application of surfactant therapy for an indication other than IRDS is in full-term infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) (Auten et al. 1991 ; Khammash et al. 1993 ; Lotze et al. 1993 Lotze et al. , 1998 Findlay et al. 1996 ) . Meconium is a thick, tarry mixture of bile acids and mucous glycoproteins that fi lls the fetal colon during gestation, and prenatal defecation associated with maternal/fetal stress can lead to meconium aspiration at birth. Meconium mechanically obstructs airways, causes infl ammation (Holopainen et al. 1999 ) , and inhibits the biophysical activity of lung surfactant (Moses et al. 1991 ; Clark et al. 1987 ) . Auten et al. ( 1991 ) , Khammash et al. ( 1993 ), and Findlay et al. ( 1996 ) have all reported signifi cant lung functional improvements following exogenous surfactant administration (Infasurf \u00ae , Survanta \u00ae ) to infants with MAS. The randomized study of Findlay et al. ( 1996 ) also found signifi cant reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax, duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, time of hospitalization, and requirements for ECMO in 20 term infants with MAS treated with Survanta \u00ae compared to a similar number of controls. Lotze et al. ( 1993 Lotze et al. ( , 1998 have also reported favorable results using Survanta \u00ae in a controlled trial in term infants referred for ECMO due to severe respiratory failure (meconium aspiration was a prevalent diagnosis). Twenty-eight infants treated with four doses of Survanta \u00ae (150 mg/kg) had improved pulmonary mechanics, decreased duration of ECMO treatment, and a lower overall incidence of complications after ECMO compared to control infants (Lotze et al. 1993 ) . A subsequent larger multicenter controlled trial in 328 term infants similarly reported signifi cant improvements in respiratory status and the need for ECMO following surfactant treatment (Lotze et al. 1998 ) . Exogenous surfactant is now used in many institutions to treat neonates with MAS. Surfactant therapy is also frequently used in intensive care nurseries to treat neonates with respiratory failure from pneumonia, although controlled studies in the NICU setting have not been done.",

Two other controlled clinical trials reporting disappointing results in adults with ALI/ARDS are those of Gregory et al. ( 1997b ) with Survanta \u00ae and Spragg et al. ( 2003 ) with recombinant SP-C surfactant (Venticute \u00ae ). These results reinforce the importance of including highly active SP-B in exogenous surfactants used to treat ALI/ARDS in adults, since Survanta \u00ae contains only minimal levels of this apoprotein (Seeger et al. 1993 ; Mizuno et al. 1995 ; Hamvas et al. 1994 ) and Venticute \u00ae contains none. The trial of Gregory et al. ( 1997b ) found small benefi ts in oxygenation for patients with sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS who received intermediate-sized doses of Survanta \u00ae (100 mg/kg), but no benefi ts in other surfactant dosage groups. There were no overall long-term benefi ts from surfactant therapy as measured by length of mechanical ventilation or survival in the total of 43 surfactant-treated patients studied (Gregory et al. 1997b ). The study of Spragg et al. ( 2003 ) showed acute increases in oxygenation following instillation of Venticute \u00ae in adults with ARDS, but no longer-term improvements (duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality). A post hoc analysis suggested possible benefi ts from surfactant therapy in the subgroup of patients with ARDS from \"direct\" lung injury. However, a follow-up randomized trial of Venticute \u00ae limited to patients with direct lung injury was recently stopped after 900 patients because of a failure to demonstrate clinical benefi ts (Spragg R, 2009, personal communication) .",

Evolving evidence documenting benefi ts for the most active exogenous surfactants in pediatric and/or adult patients with direct pulmonary ALI/ ARDS will hopefully allow earlier and bettertargeted use of this intervention in the future. Finally, a major issue regarding the most optimal use of surfactant therapy in ALI/ARDS involves its combination with added agents or interventions that target other aspects of the complex pathophysiology of acute infl ammatory lung injury. Combination therapy approaches may be particularly important in adults with ALI/ARDS, where responses to exogenous surfactant have so far been disappointing in terms of improving long-term outcomes. Combination therapies designed to exploit potential mechanistic synergy between surfactant and agents directed at different facets of lung injury may have a more substantial impact on long-term outcomes in patients with ALI/ARDS. The rationale for the use of exogenous surfactant therapy in specifi c combined-modality interventions for ALI/ ARDS is described in more detail elsewhere (Raghavendran et al. 2008b ; Notter et al. 2000 ; Pryhuber et al. 2005 ) . Examples of agents that might be synergistic with exogenous surfactant in ALI/ARDS include vasoactive drugs such as inhaled nitric oxide, which has the potential to selectively enhance perfusion in newly ventilated lung regions recruited by exogenous surfactant (Raghavendran et al. 2008b ; Notter et al. 2000 ; Pryhuber et al. 2005 ) . Other drugs for possible use in combination with exogenous surfactant include anti-infl ammatory antibodies or receptor antagonists, antioxidants, and antioxidant enzymes (Raghavendran et al. 2008b ; Notter et al. 2000 ; Pryhuber et al. 2005 ) . Specifi c ventilator modalities or ventilation strategies that reduce iatrogenic lung injury may be equally important to consider in conjunction with surfactant therapy (Raghavendran et al. 2008b ; Notter et al. 2000 ; Pryhuber et al. 2005 ) .",

Today lifesaving surfactant replacement therapy in premature infants is a crucial staple of neonatal intensive care. The development of surfactant replacement therapy for acute respiratory failure associated with lung injury (ALI/ARDS) has shared some of the same growing pains found in the case of IRDS, including the use of nonoptimal exogenous surfactants and delivery methods in initial controlled clinical trials. In addition, the complex multifaceted pathology of ALI/ ARDS clearly presents more of a challenge for surfactant therapy compared to surfactantdefi cient IRDS. It remains to be determined if the reversal of surfactant dysfunction in patients with ALI/ARDS will prove similarly lifesaving, despite the fact that a fi rm basic science rationale for exogenous surfactant therapy exists.",

Evidence is clear that endogenous surfactant becomes dysfunctional in direct forms of acute infl ammatory lung injury, and exogenous surfactant therapy has been shown to mitigate lung injury severity in multiple animal models of ALI/ARDS. Treatment of humans with ALI/ ARDS with exogenous surfactants in clinical studies has been associated with improved oxygenation and few side effects and has led to improved longer-term outcomes in several patient populations. In particular, surfactant therapy has been documented to be benefi cial in term infants with meconium aspiration lung injury, and it is also used in treating acute respiratory failure in neonatal pneumonia. Studies on surfactant therapy in children with direct pulmonary ALI/ARDS are also promising, with improvements found not only in lung function but also in longer-term variables (including survival in a recent study (Willson et al. 2005 ) ). A substantial number of studies in adults with ALI/ARDS have also reported acute improvements in lung function (oxygenation) from surfactant therapy (Table 28 .3 ). Lung functional improvements in principle have the potential to lower required ventilator distending pressures and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and infl ammatory cytokine production that can worsen patient outcomes. Signifi cant statistical correlations have been demonstrated between acute improvements in lung function and improvements in clinically signifi cant long-term outcomes in surfactant-treated infants with IRDS (Segerer et al. 1991 ; Kuint et al. 1994 ) .",

These lung injury syndromes have a complex multifaceted pathophysiology that includes not only surfactant dysfunction but also prominent elements of infl ammation, vascular dysfunction, and oxidant injury. In addition, progressive fi broproliferative lung injury may be present, as well as multiorgan pathology, particularly in patients with \"indirect\" or \"extrapulmonary\" ALI/ARDS. This multifaceted pathology reduces the resolving power of clinical studies to demonstrate benefi cial effects on long-term outcomes from surfactant therapy, even if the intervention itself is effective in mitigating its targeted aspect of lung injury (i.e., surfactant dysfunction). Controlled trials in adults with ALI/ARDS have not yet shown that surfactant therapy can substantially improve long-term outcomes, although exogenous surfactants with the greatest content of highly active SP-B have not been tested in detail in adults. Another major area that has received relatively little study in clinical trials to date is the use of exogenous surfactant therapy in combination with potentially synergistic agents or interventions that target additional aspects of the complex pathophysiology of acute infl ammatory lung injury.
