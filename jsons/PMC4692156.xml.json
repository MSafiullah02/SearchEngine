Agar-filled \u201csettle plates\u201d caught bioaerosols that fell out of the air because of gravity, and a Bourdillon slit impactor4 collected air samples. Cistern-fed, gravity-flow toilets and a mains-fed pressure-valve toilet were examined. In addition to colonies found on the floor-based settle plates, microbes were still being captured from the air 8 minutes after the flush, indicating collection of \u201cdroplet nuclei\u201d bioaerosols. Droplet nuclei are the tiny particles that remain after the water in a droplet evaporates. They have negligible settling velocity and will float with natural air currents.5 Jessen observed that the amount of bioaerosol increased with increasing flush energy.3\n",

A wash-down toilet releases the flush water from the toilet rim where it flows down the bowl walls and washes the waste into the S-shaped exit trapway.7 Bioaerosol was detected in samples collected above the toilet 5 to 7 minutes after the flush, indicating droplet nuclei bioaerosol. Despite over 99% reductions in bowl water microbial concentrations with each flush, air samples indicated only 50% to 60% bioaerosol reductions. They concluded that this was at least partially attributable to a reduction in the number of bacteria per droplet rather than a reduction in the number of droplets containing bacteria because both a multiorganism droplet and a single-organism droplet would appear as 1 colony when deposited on an impactor agar plate.",

For the first sample set (0-2 hours), cultured bacteria were predominantly from plates near the toilet, whereas, in later sample sets (2-4 and 4-6 hours), the positive plates were more randomly distributed around the room. This was consistent with an initial deposition of large droplets close to the toilet immediately after the flush, followed by dispersion and mixing of the droplet nuclei into the air with delayed deposition throughout the room. The E coli bioaerosol remained airborne and viable for at least 4 to 6 hours postflush.",

Settle plates were placed near the toilet and air was sampled at seat height, flush handle height, and midway in-between, with the toilet lid both up and down. Settle plates showed widespread dissemination of large droplets with the lid up but not with the lid down. C difficile was recovered from air sampled at heights up to 25 cm above the toilet seat and up to 90 minutes after flushing, at concentrations 12-fold greater with the lid up than with the lid down. They concluded that lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of C difficile environmental contamination and thus discouraged their use. In the United States, however, this would contradict current Uniform Plumbing Code specifications regarding toilet seat design and the installation of toilet seat lids on health care and other public facility \u201cwater closets\u201d14 as well as similar requirements for gap-front seats without cover for water closets in the US Veterans Administration specifications often cited for health care facility design.15\n",

            "text": "In 1956, Hutchinson associated the transmission of Sonne dysentery with Shigella contamination on toilet seats,23 and a number of subsequent field studies have detected contamination on toilet seats and surrounding surfaces with fecal organisms.9, 11, 24, 25 Thorough cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in health care facilities is a foundational component of infection control programs,26 and disinfection is particularly important because many studies have shown that microbial surface contamination (including C difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) may persist even after cleaning.27, 28, 29 The limits of environmental cleaning in preventing spread of viral disease are apparent with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). AGE is frequently caused by norovirus, and the diarrhea and vomiting typically associated with AGE as well as the high viral loads in both stools and vomit suggest a likely toilet role in disease transmission. Environmental contamination has been shown to be a major source of AGE infection on ships,30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 including during sequential voyages of a cruise ship in spite of aggressive sanitation efforts and a documented history of good Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vessel Sanitation Program inspection scores.34 This may be due in part to the ability of toilets to continue generating contaminated toilet plume during multiple flushes after original contamination as well as the apparent resistance of norovirus36 and perhaps other viruses to cleaning and disinfection. Gerba et al observed that MS2 bacteriophage and poliovirus were not completely cleared from a toilet even after 7 flushes and that scrubbing with or without addition of a surfactant to the water was only minimally effective in eliminating these residual organisms.10 The manner in which cleaning and disinfection is performed is also important in ensuring complete disinfection of surfaces, especially when surfaces are heavily contaminated.37\n",

AGE incidence among those using communal bathrooms correlated significantly with the bathroom usage density. It was also shown that, in cabins with multiple occupants, the risk of a second person developing disease was higher in cabins where the first person had vomited, even though none of the subsequent cases either assisted the ill person or cleaned up the vomit. Presence in the room when vomiting actually occurred also did not appear to matter.

A report on the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens apartment complex concluded that exposure and disease propagation was likely due to virus-laden aerosols originating in the sanitary system.64 The system was contaminated with SARS CoV when the index patient, who was suffering from diarrhea, visited one of the apartments and used the toilet. Sewer drain bioaerosol was believed to be drawn through dry floor drain U-tube traps into the bathrooms of other apartments by bathroom exhaust fans, and some may have then been exhausted to the outside of the multistory building and carried upward to other apartments. Prevailing winds were thought to be responsible for carrying the infectious aerosol to nearby buildings where cases also occurred.63, 75 These studies suggest that SARS CoV droplet nuclei bioaerosols produced from contaminated sewage may have been highly infectious for significant periods and over long distances. Because the infectious waste, whether feces or vomit, is most concentrated in the toilet bowl and substantial quantities of aerosol are known to be produced during flushing, it might reasonably be expected that infectious SARS CoV droplet nuclei bioaerosol would also be produced during toilet flushing. To date, however, this has not been either experimentally or epidemiologically demonstrated.",
