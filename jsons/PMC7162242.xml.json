During this period, the percentage of H1N1sw-positive samples remained stable at c. 10%. In September, the number of samples increased suddenly but the percentage of H1N1sw-positive samples decreased (Fig. 1).

The N'/N ratio (allowing standardization of the number of samples in the age groups) showed that the highest proportion of positive patients was observed in the 10\u201319 years age group (30\u201360%) and that this proportion fluctuated c. 20% for patients over 40 years old (Fig. 2c\n).

            "text": "The retrospective analysis of the first 7 months (from late April to late November; weeks 17\u201348) of the wave of H1N1sw pandemic infections in the region of Marseille (south-eastern France) indicates that three periods with distinct epidemiological characteristics can be distinguished. The very first imported cases were observed from April to August in travellers returning from abroad (mainly Mexico and the USA), and thus with a majority of adults [9]. In the second phase, with indigenous cases, which became predominant during the summer, the number of paediatric cases (<10 years old) increased progressively to reach a stable proportion of approximately 40% of all cases. Consequently, the global distribution among age groups became comparable to that previously observed for seasonal H1N1 outbreaks [11], with a majority of cases in patients younger than 20 years, confirming data from other countries [7, 12]) and a low number of patients over 60 years old. The final phase, a \u2018winter\u2019 wave, began in Marseille during October (as was also observed in other regions of metropolitan France [13]) 2\u20133 months before the classic winter wave of seasonal influenza.",

Whether \u2018classical\u2019 tests (designed for detection of seasonal A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B viruses) could be used for the detection of the new A/H1N1sw variant was uncertain and contrasting results had been obtained using various available commercial kits [13, 14, 15, 16]. Our results suggest that RIDTs could make a significant contribution to the management of suspected cases. They allowed more rapid delivery of positive diagnosis (<2 h) for 49.4% of the H1N1sw-positive samples, the highest sensitivity (close to 60%) being obtained in children younger than 10 years. Other studies showed a similar sensitivity for the detection of this new variant [13] and an equal analytical sensitivity between seasonal influenza and this new variant [14] using the BD EZ Flu A+B test.",

Approximately 30 bed-days were attributable to H1N1sw in the public hospitals of Marseille, of which six were in ICUs. Since the public hospitals of Marseille serve a population of approximately one million inhabitants, these numbers are similar to those encountered in surveys previously performed in Australia and New Zealand [8]. Importantly, our results indicate that the duration of hospitalization was short for patients admitted to medical units, but also that the pattern of hospitalization observed (children younger than 1 year and patients over 40 years being significantly more frequently hospitalized than others) was reminiscent of the U-shaped age-distribution curve previously reported for seasonal influenza.",
