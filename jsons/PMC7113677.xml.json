In the viral genome, ORF1 codes for the replicase (Rep) protein and ORF2 for the capsid (Cap) protein. The Rep protein is a non-structural protein and functions for the viral replication, while the structural Cap protein dominates immunogenicity (Cheung, 2003; Mankertz et al., 1998a, b; Nawagitgul et al., 2002). As a DNA virus, PCV2 has high evolutionary mutation rate of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year, and has been constantly evolving. With the emerging viral strains, PCV2 has been divided into 5 genotypes, namely PCV2a\u20132e strains, according to the diversity level of the ORF2 nucleotide sequences (Franzo et al., 2016; Segales et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2016). The continued mutation in the PCV2 genome (Eddicks et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2018) made it more difficult to identify, especially by some older molecular detection methods.",

To ensure that the obtained PCV3 genome was from a single genome, and not amplified from more than one genome, a full length PCV3 genome was amplified by a single pair of tail-to-tail primers that overlapped at a unique PstI site in the PCV3 genome (illustrated in Fig. 1\n). The full-genome amplicon of PCV3 was then digested with the PstI restriction enzyme and cloned into pACYC177 cloning vector. The PCV2 fragments containing the assay targets were also amplified, and the PCR product was cloned into the pCR\u21222.1 vector using the original TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, CA).

With the help of bioinformatics tools, 1907 PCV2 full genome sequences that were currently available in the GenBank were downloaded and analyzed to achieve high coverage in the assay design stage. We believe that the coverage of the primers and probes over available sequences in the designing stage is the best estimation of assay\u2019s future diagnostic sensitivity against field strains (Bai et al., 2018). Compared to the three published duplex assays, our assay has much higher coverages: 97.9% (184/188) for PCV3 and 99.1% (1889/1907) for PCV2. All 4 PCV3 strains that our primers or probes mismatch to are all single nucleotide variations, and very often these oligoes that have single nucleotide mismatches will not affect their ability of binding to the templates. Therefore, the actual diagnostic sensitivity for PCV3 can be higher than this estimation. Using two non-overlapping targets for a given virus may not increase the assay\u2019s analytical sensitivity, but it will increase field strain coverage, and will help to detect strains with additional mutations, as the chance for a strain to have mutations on both target sites is small. Also, compared to the LOD of 50 copies per reaction in Kim et al. (2017) and 90 copies per reaction in Zhang et al. (2018), our assay appeared to be more sensitive: 17 copies per reaction of PCV3 and 14 copies per reaction of PCV2. The LOD of PCV2 was also evaluated with cell culture, with an LOD of around 1.4 TCID50 per reaction. In addition, the internal control, swine SB2M gene, is included in our assay to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiencies and potential PCR inhibitions in order to reduce the false-negative rate, which were not used in the previous studies.",
