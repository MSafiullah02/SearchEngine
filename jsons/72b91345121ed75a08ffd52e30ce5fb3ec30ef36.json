With the increasing case numbers, there has been a greater focus on infection control measures, particularly in hospitals where there is potential for spread of the virus not just between patients but also to staff members in healthcare 5 . These measures can be implemented not just at hospital level, but also regional or even national level. There have been articles on how radiology departments can exercise caution to reduce the risk of an outbreak in their unit 6 , but still little advice has been given in the nuclear medicine setting. Whilst there are similarities, there are also pertinent differences between the subspecialties regarding the urgency of scans, length of patient contact, ability for portable scanners and period of scans, which we feel would necessitate a separate set of advice.",

The airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence; however, it can be envisaged if certain aerosol-generating procedures are conducted in health care facilities 7 such as supplemental oxygen or intubation. There are some clues from previous outbreaks of coronaviridae such as the SARS and MERS epidemics, that have given rise to advice and measures in the current outbreak 8 .

A notice at the reception desk for patients to self-declare would be helpful. Large departments dealing with outpatient or provider to provider referrals, should consider thermal screening using mass screening systems that measure the skin temperature at high-speed using thermal imaging and temperature measurement equipment as used in airports. Healthcare staff should recognise the symptoms of COVID-19 infection, including fever, dry cough, fatigue and dyspnoea. However they should also be aware of the fact that there are asymptomatic carriers of the virus and a good contact history is of use. It may be prudent to ensure the waiting area has access to hand washing facilities and tissue boxes and masks are within easy reach so patients can be encouraged to follow basic hygiene practices 9 . The waiting area may need to have enough space so that waiting patients may sit at enough distance, as the risk of transmission increases within three feet 27 .",

It is therefore crucial that potentially infected patients should be identified prior to this step, as physical contact is inevitable for cannulation, and a significant amount of time may be spent with the patient. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory if COVID-19 spreads widely in the UK. This consists of eye protection with goggles, surgical masks at least (if N95 masks are unavailable), fluid resistant isolation gown and disposable gloves. However, currently performing procedures with full PPE is difficult at the best of times, and this may affect the ability of staff to handle the same patient load as before.
