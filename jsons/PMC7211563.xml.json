Potential accessibility ensures the optimum access to comprehensive and quality healthcare to every single individual of a population within a short of healthcare service providers [1]. Adequate accessibility to healthcare service is one of the vital elements for holding an advanced society status. Thus, it holds a position in the 17th global targets set by the United Nations for promoting sustainable development goals [2]. WHO under the human right concept describe accessibility as availability of health services within a safe and reasonable physical reach to all section of the population especially vulnerable and marginal groups likely ethnic minorities and indigenous people, women, children, aged groups and persons with disabilities including in rural areas [3]. A United States President\u2019s Commission in 1983 sort to explain the meaning and conceptual problem related to accessibility that equitable access to healthcare should be in a manner that every single citizen can acquire an adequate level of medical care without excessive burdens [4]. Another Commission came with a solution regarding the conceptual problems related to access and gave a comprehensible answer that the concept of accessibility is as important as the usage of service for health outcomes. Their definition relies on both the concept of timely use of healthcare services and on the best possible use of health outcome [5].",

Geospatial techniques are widely used in different field of studies related to healthcare for maximizing the geographical accessibility to medical services [11]. GIS is a platform which provides a framework in relation to the population for both assessments of the distribution of healthcare centres and evaluation of effective coverage [12]. Spatial or geographical accessibility generally refers to the physical access of a user to a provider\u2019s location [13] or simply reflect the linkages between the point of supply and point of demand by taking consideration of existing transport framework and travel impedance [14]. Accessibility is a multidimensional concept which inherent both spatial dimension such as availability, accessibility and non-spatial dimensions like affordability, acceptability and accommodation [15, 16]. Khan [16] highlighted the vehicular travel time/distance and Euclidean distance for characterising spatial attributes to measure spatial accessibility. Spatial separation based model is a suitable approach when there is incomplete and lacking transport network data and give desirable result for accessibility operation by using the physical distance between infrastructures as it only uses the location of services of interest [17]. Cumulative opportunity or isochrones approach is an effective method as it considers the elements of travel time as well as maximum desirable travel time by capturing land use pattern and infrastructural barrier across the land cover. Gravity Model is another model for operating accessibility provides the size of the zone of interest, the configuration of the zone, choice of attractor variables and the values of travel impedance time. Besides these approaches, the two-step floating catchment area was (2SFCA) proposed by Luo and Wang for calculating spatial accessibility [18]. In this method, a floating catchment area is selected as a window to measure service-to-population ratio for each healthcare service. After that, the entire ratio is summed up for each point of location within the catchment area and use it as an accessibility index of that location. Enhanced two steps floating catchment area method come to overcome the rigidity and arbitrariness of the 2SFCA i.e. it does not take into account the distance decay method, it sets catchment and subzones of healthcare by considering travel time or travel distance based on the road network is often used as the spatial barrier or impedance [19]. Three steps floating catchment area method used by Rekha et al. [1] to calculate accessibility by considering three attributes namely attractiveness of health services, travel time and distance between the location of the service centre and the location of residents and population demand for healthcare facilities.",

GIS application in healthcare accessibility measurement is exclusively popular for two decades [20]. GIS is one of the sophisticated spatial analyst techniques that not only potential to identify demand flexible points based on residential clustering but also pinpoint spatial inequalities in healthcare delivery points and provide suitable locations for new health facilities [11]. The geographical dimension of access can be authentically expressed by GIS and appreciate the fact that GIS technique has potential to fit in a wide range of aspects such as identification of vulnerable population who are devoid of service reach, delimit the points of quality service and treatment without looking at the loopholes in previous qualitative research [21]. Several studies found that GIS technique is very useful in the demarcation of nearest healthcare centre for different road network by using patient\u2019s postal/zip code and converted then into grid reference to find straight line or travel time distance [11, 22]. Geographical information system applied to measure the relative importance of distance on providers to gain treatment for depression and also tried to understand the barriers regarding the adaptation of such medical facilities in rural as well as urban areas [23]. Distance and travel time are the most important factor for serving people because the number of death increases with increasing travel time to a hospital in a region [24]. GIS offers a distance tool to estimate travel time between healthcare and residential premises and also deals with the shortest and fastest path analysis to reach nearby healthcare in a short time interval.",

The above statistics on literacy, male\u2013female ratio of literacy, and worker pattern indicate that this region is not well developed in term education and occupation. As far as the healthcare facilities are concerned, the district depicts a deprived health service profile where only one medical college and hospital is situated with a bed occupancy rate of 139.8. There is only three super-specialist hospital and four sub-division hospitals are present with a bed occupancy rate of 97.5 and 127.55 respectively [27]. Rural hospital and public healthcare are also available but the service qualities are not well. Moreover, the accessibility of these healthcare facilities is also a vital concern and need to bring focus on proper access to present institutions and also the elimination of disparity region.",

Optimal exercise of healthcare facilities assessment is not an easy task and can be done by estimating location-based accessibility and individual-based accessibility. Spatial distribution of public health services illustrates a healthcare profile of any space. Murshidabad district has an average portrait of medical services where availability of health institutions is not quite unacceptable but accessibility in terms of a positive outcome is not adequate. A positive outcome can be assessed through efficient treatment, adequacy of a speciality hospital, proper diagnostic and treatment skills of the provider.

Geographical accessibility and availability of healthcare services contain spatial dimension which can be analysed by geographical information system while the rest two i.e. affordability and acceptability are non-spatial dimensions. Many types of research have been done to achieve higher accessibility to healthcare service mainly under the four notions: distance from the system works under two concepts i.e. nearest service centre to the population and average distance to the set of service centres, the threshold of the service, gravitational models for providers. Distance is the major element to calculate higher accessibility to the service. Sometimes it can be measured trough nearest location to the population, travel cost, travel time. Nearest the location of a service centre lesser the travel time and will minimize the travel cost, ultimately provide higher accessibility. Travel cost and the travel time will also be considered as an important element to measure the non-spatial dimension. Geographical information system (GIS) studies commonly used Euclidean distance method to calculate nearest the location of a service centre i.e. distance from a population centre [1]. This method faces drawback to provide suitable site mainly in urban areas where the population enjoys sets of service options within a certain point or point of reference. Thus, average travel impedance to the service will be suited to ensure spatial accessibility as it incorporates both the entities; accessibility and availability to the population. The threshold of the service can be calculated by several patients per medical institutions. It also refers to the supply options which incorporates doctor\u2013patient ratio, number of bed per person. This method can be shown by density analysis (Point, Line, Kernel density) in GIS researches. This method also has some demerits as it does not consider the cross-border population demand to reference supply point. The gravity model is an updated version on Newton\u2019s law of gravity to analyse the spatial accessibility. This model overcomes the problems associated with former dimensions. It incorporates accessibility and availability of services within both rural and urban settings. It also helps to set the potential supply options to a certain set of potential population point.

It can be calculated by using the equation:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$f\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{nh}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} k\\left( \\frac{x - Xi}{s}\\right)$$\\end{document}fy=1nh\u2211i=1nkx-XisWhere \u2018k\u2019 is the kernel function with density f(y), \u2018y\u2019 is the sampled data, \u2018n\u2019 is the number of sample and\u2018s\u2019 is the smoothing parameter or say bandwidth.",

Healthcare accessibility in this district is always a major issue as most of the inhabitants prefer to gain health services due to poor and inefficient access to medical care. The present study aims to explore the suitable site for medical institution after analysing the present situation of healthcare facilities within the district. For the existing situation of health care facilities, the relative accessibility index (RAI) was calculated by considering no. of medical institutions, no.of patients admitted in a year, and no.of doctors available per day. The result of the existing situation of health care facility reveals that the spatial distribution is not uniform throughout the district (Fig. 2). Hence, for better treatment and getting well service, the resident has to travel another place after crossing a long distance, whereas, many suitable conditions for developing better service have already existed here. The numbers of medical institutions have clustered at the central part of the district i.e. the district capital, Behrampore. As a result, the residents of the other areas are suffered to get better facilities. Thus, the present study was carried out to find suitable locations for health care service by developing a hybrid decision model. For the same, the decision hierarchy was developed using existing facilities of health service, their spatial distance, density and proximity to support the suitable places; where better and well-accommodated health care service would be proposed by considering the local land use and distance to transportation route. After getting selected the proposed sites for local health care service, these are linked with district medical college and hospital located at the central part using shortest path network analysis. This effort will offer better health service to the residents reside at the peripheral part of the district and interlinked with medical college and hospital.",

Thus, from the overall spatial result of the relative accessibility index, it can be decided that the study area is poor in term of medical facilities and health care services. Thus, looking towards this problematic issue, the present study proposed a hybrid decision model with three tiers of analysis to find suitable places for new health care and shortest distance to interlink with the district medical hospital. The first tier of analysis highlighted the distance, density and proximate of each existing health care to find more deprived and inaccessible areas in term of health service. The second tier of analysis emphasized to find suitable sites for proposing new health care services based on land use land cover, distance to road, rail, and proximity to residential areas. Finally, the third tier of analysis highlighted the most suitable sites among the proposed health care and network analysis through the shortest path to connect with district medical hospital.",

The result from each layer of distance, density and proximate reveal that the peripheral parts of the district have always lower facilities. The lower distance to healthcare indicates higher accessibility; lower density of healthcare indicates lower accessibility and closer to healthcare shows higher accessibility. These three spatial layers integrated to consider the accessibility and inaccessibility to healthcare facilities throughout the study area. The 1\u20135 point scale was used for linear combination i.e. 1 for low accessibility (inaccessibility) and 5 for higher accessibility of healthcare facility. Figure 4 shows the overlay result.

These factors were buffered around the road, buffer around rail, land use land cover and buffer around the settlement (Fig. 5). If the suitable sites for healthcare facilities would locate within 5 km, then it would be considered as more suitable than located far from the road because it will offer higher accessibility in term of travel time as well as travel coast. Any healthcare that is located nearer to the railway, it will be considered as most accessible because of getting immediate and fast service. Land use land cover should be considered before going to choose any space for locating health care. Barren land and agricultural fellow nearer to the settlement would be the best site because this site will offer lower land price, utilization of land, and also getting close to residential areas. The sites that are located within 5 km distance to populated areas will get the best service. Thus, looking towards these conditions, 8 suitable sites were proposed in the present study which can offer health service in inaccessible areas (Fig. 6). The proposed health care in a suitable site can be merged and interlinked with existing health care to make the district enrich and accessible in term of health service. This is figured in supplementary file (S-1). It is essential to validate the location of each proposed site by verifying ground truth. In the present study, site-1 and site-3 were validated through the ground visit. But the rest sites were not visited; instead, their ground truth was measured in Google Earth search engine. All sites were selected in open space, barren land or agricultural land, by considering their location nearer to settlement, closer to transportable routes. These ground locations were also plotted in Google Earth search engine, which is shown in Fig. 7.",

This site is far from the district medical college and other health care facilities and resides by a huge number of the rural population and therefore, it is the best site to shape modern health care to serve large people surrounding by connecting district medical college and another hospital on a transfer basis (Figs. 6, 7). Consequently, site-2 and 7 have the lowest Pi with 0.35 and 0.37 respectively. It is because these sites are within 30 km from the district medical college, very close to rail and road transportation route and these sites are considered as already accessible.

This study offered a hybrid decision-making approach for proposing suitable sites regarding better healthcare service. To provide better service and reach a deprived group of people, a pipe dream was prepared that needs for logical decision making and resolve existing problems. The result reveals that spatial discrepancy exists in case of access to healthcare facilities. The location of existing healthcare primarily clusters in the central and northern portions. The distance, density and proximate analysis of these healthcares explored the spatial inaccessible areas. To achieve equal access, allocation of new healthcare is essential to reduce the spatial disparity. Thus, the equal weight-based weighted linear combination was performed using land use, proximity to road and rail, and distance to residential areas to support suitable site for determining and allocating new healthcare facilities.",

Poor accessibility and poor health services in an area increase health and social disparities. Hence, the urgent requirement is needed to increase accessibility. The present study emphasized the same issue and developed a hybrid approach to integrate multiple factors to propose sites for new healthcare facilities and remove spatial disparity in the study area. The advantages of developing and using a hybrid model are (1) it integrates different models and approach, (2) it increases the accuracy of the result and reduces the drawbacks of single model and method, (3) it interlinks two or more aspects of a study, for instance, in case of the present study using a hybrid model two aspects, i.e. accessibility to healthcare and site suitability of healthcare have been determined, and (4) hybrid model helps in simplifying the complex relationship of among criteria or perspective. However, a hybrid model also suffers from some disadvantages, like (1) it is more complex to apply (2) the preparation of model take more times than single model (3) sometimes it also suffers from overfitting etc. Therefore, removing such disadvantages and adopting the above-mentioned advantages, the present proposed and used a hybrid model to show healthcare accessibility and site suitability. This study would appear like a good source of health service enhancement and plan implementation to policymakers and health planners. Recently, not only our country but the world worried about the outbreak of \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019. The government truly finds enormous space for \u2018isolation\u2019 service. Globally 2,193,558 confirmed cases are reported (till 17.04.2020). India is no exception in this case, where, 13,495 confirmed cases are identified. It is assumed that Murshidabad is also too much vulnerable as there is a lack of basic infrastructure. Therefore, in this regards, it is recommended that Government and local planners can start medical emergency in proposed sites with primary equipment and service to reach target population groups. On getting success in the mission, modern infrastructural development and service could be proposed afterwards.",
