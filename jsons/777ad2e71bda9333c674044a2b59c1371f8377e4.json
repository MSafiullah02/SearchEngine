We have conducted an anonymous online survey of Asian medical students in Poland to assess whether they experience any form of prejudice related to the ongoing pandemic. As demonstrated, the COVID-19 outbreak had triggered xenophobic reactions towards students of Asian-origin (n=85) before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was confirmed in Poland. Facing prejudice, including discrimination related to COVID-19, may add to feelings of isolation of students of Asian origin who study abroad, and affect career development, especially for students. We recommend that universities should proactively develop policies that support students, faculty, and staff affected by discriminatory behavior both during the current outbreak and in the future. However, preventing such behaviors should also be enforced by national authorities",

The first cases in North America, Oceania, and Europe were reported in January 2020, while the spread of COVID-19 to Africa and South America was confirmed in February 2020 [4] . With epidemiological updates reported by different authorities daily, the outbreak has received enormous attention from the worldwide mass media [2] . However unavoidable, this has triggered an unintended backlash of public fear and panic, which in selected countries has preceded the emergence of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases [5, 6] . Considering that the majority of affected individuals, including those with fatal outcomes, are of Asian origin, one could, sadly, expect an increase in Asia-phobic reactions [7] . In the past, the epidemic of infectious diseases has also been associated with the backlash of discrimination and xenophobia, and this was also seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [8] [9] [10] .",

Apart from preventing the spread of disease, they are worn for unrelated reasons such as to guard against air pollution and allergens, or as a social firewall [11] . However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the use of face masks may also be a potential source of public misassumption that any Asian individual wearing them constitutes a threat of COVID-19.",

Such behaviors can particularly affect those individuals of Asian origin who are tending to wear face masks. Overall, these findings underscore the responsibility of different parties in overcoming and preventing discrimination during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Firstly, universities that host Asian students and staff from abroad should support their students during the outbreak (and any other future epidemic emerging from Asian region) and protect them from harmful misconceptions. This may be achieved by providing reinforcing statements as well as educational campaigns related both to the outbreak and the true reasons behind the use of face masks [17] . The preventive measures, as well as policy development and implementation, should also be undertaken by those involved in the management of international student exchange programs, and by national and international authorities for higher education. To maximally increase output, mass and social media should be employed in undertaken actions [18] . The successful implementation of anti-discriminatory practices requires to follow advice on intercultural communication, also when reporting and visualizing public health risks [19, 20] .",

The students were asked to provide answers to questions exploring whether they have faced any prejudice during their stay in Poland (on the street, at restaurants, during shopping, at health service units, and at university) since the outbreak began in China and if such was the case, to briefly describe their experiences and to indicate how much it affected them on 0-5 Likert scale (0 -not at all; 5 -very much).
