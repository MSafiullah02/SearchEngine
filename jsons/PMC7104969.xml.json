Dynamic entry of IAV starts from binding of haemagglutinin (HA) with sialic acid [5], followed by two pH-controlled events. The optimal acid milieu in late endosomes triggers conformational alterations of HA, which fuses IAV with host endosomal membrane. Prior to fusion, acidic activation of the M2 ion channel occurs in early endosomes, which facilitates IAV uncoating [6]. Thus, inhibiting HA or M2 constitutes the primary mechanisms to suppress IAV entry. Though M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, can block IAV entry, the emergence of adamantane-resistant M2 and associated adverse effects temper their clinical application [7].",

M2 proton conduction may involve interactions between protonated His37 and Trp41 of TM at an acidic pH, which is responsible for adamantane-based sensitivity [9]. M2 oligomerization, based on assessment of either tetramerization of M2 TM peptides or dimerization of full-length M2, was particularly necessary for its entire channel function [8], [9], [10], [11]. TM of M2 was sufficient to form tetrameric M2 [12], which was unstable unless AH is present [9], [10], [13].

BA-based medications have evolved from hydrophobic chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its taurine-conjugate TCDCA to more hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its taurine-conjugate TUDCA. Both later strategies are current FDA-approved treatments for human liver disorders [19]. Since BA reduces intracellular protein aggregates as chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) does, UDCA and TUDCA are considered as chemical chaperones [20]. Recently, TUDCA is implicated as a therapy for hepatitis B virus infection [21]. TUDCA also inhibits IAV replication [22] by suppressing the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) [22], [23], a conserved molecular network orchestrating ER pathology.",

For animal infection, SPF-housed C57BL/6J mice (4-week old, male, 16\u201318 g) from Vital River (Beijing, China) were used and infected. Lung injury was induced by intratracheal injection of live H5N1 IAV at a titre of 1 \u00d7 106 TCID50-1.6 \u00d7 106 TCID50 or identical volume of AF (vehicle control). Body weight and survival rate were recorded every day after intratracheally challenged with either AF or H5N1 IAV. TUDCA at 150 mg/kg was intratracheally administrated to mice 24 and 6 h before IAV exposure or 6 and 24 h after IAV injection to determine prophylactic and therapeutic effects, respectively. Dose of TUDCA for in vivo tests was chosen from previous studies [20]. Histological assessment of mouse lung tissue and measurement of mouse lung wet/dry ratio were performed 4 days post infection. Lung injury scores were fulfilled as described [24]. Details are given in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

UPR activation occurred in parallel with hyperplasia of smooth ER, which became striking 24 h post infection (Fig. 1\na). However, UPR responsive pathways were absent in HPAI A H5N1-challenged host (Fig. S1b online), including IRE-1\u03b1 branch (Fig. S1a online). Though lack of typical UPR signatures, a remarkable ER swelling was detectable 1 h after H5N1 infection (Fig. 1a). This result confirmed ER involvement in IAV life cycle and further suggested different ER responses to seasonal and highly pathogenic IAV infection. In contrast to previous reports where UPR activation mediates pandemic IAV-induced acute lung injuries (ALI) [23], the absence of UPR in highly pathogenic H5N1-infected cells in our study suggests alternative underlying mechanisms. In light of severe ER swelling induced 1 h after H5N1 infection, we explored the potentiality of clinically available ER stress inhibitors, TUDCA and 4-PBA, as anti-H5N1 strategies.",

When added 12 h before and during infection, TUDCA restored A549 cell viability from 41.6% to 82.5% 48 h after H5N1 exposure (Fig. 1b) with a nearly undetectable viral load (Fig. 1c). Notably, the anti-H5N1 effect of TUDCA was only achieved at relatively high doses, which were much greater than those used to relieve ER stress [22], [23]. In view of good tolerance and apparent benefits of high dose TUDCA against lethal IAV infection (Fig. S1c, d online), we utilized 3 mmol/L in our in vitro studies. Due to lack of UPR, TUDCA did not impact UPR markers in H5N1-exposed cells, though H1N1-infected cells could possess a tight association of TUDCA with IRE-1\u03b1 (Fig. S1a, b online), as shown previously [22]. In contrast, 4-PBA failed to rescue H5N1-induced cell death (Fig. S1e, f online), which supports an UPR-independent antiviral action of TUDCA. Moreover, protection of the host against H5N1 infection was unsuccessful when TUDCA was added 3 h post H5N1 challenge compared to prophylactic interventions (\u22126 and \u22123 h) or therapeutic treatments within 2 h after infection (Fig. 1d). As 2\u20133 h is the critical time point corresponding to the end of HA fusion and the start of viral genome transportation [26], our results suggest IAV entry as a target of TUDCA.",

To clarify in which step TUDCA plays a role, we permuted TUDCA treatment into four tactics based on when TUDCA is administered to the host, namely either before or concomitant with IAV infection (Figs. 2c and S2c (online)). Intriguingly, even when cells were not pre-exposed, as long as TUDCA was applied during IAV infection (\u2212/+), TUDCA inhibition of IAV entry was comparable to the condition where TUDCA was added both before and during infection (+/+). Meanwhile, presence of TUDCA during infection (\u2212/+ and +/+) was critical, as removal of TUDCA during infection even after a 12 h pre-treatment of the host (+/\u2212) failed to prevent viral infection, an effect similar to non-TUDCA-treated cells (\u2212/\u2212). This result suggests that the anti-IAV effects of TUDCA unlikely rely on priming host cells. We further verified this point by testing dynamics of host cell endocytosis using virus-free, fluorescence-labeled dextran (Fig. 2d). Our results showed no inhibition of dextran uptake by TUDCA at both 20 and 60 min after dextran loading, indicating that TUDCA does not affect host endocytosis. In addition, TUDCA as a bile acid may sequester cholesterol from the cellular membrane, leading to attenuated viral entry [27]. Here, we found no decrease of internalized H5N1 when cells were pre-incubated with cholesterol-depleting methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD, Fig. 2e and S2d (online)), consistent with H1N1-infected cells [28]. Altogether, these data indicate TUDCA may target IAV instead of the host.",

We verified bands of M2 oligomers by M2 specific antibody (Fig. S3i online) and confirmed disruption of M2 oligomers by TUDCA through co-incubating TUDCA with either authentic H5N1 IAV (Fig. 3d) or corresponding iVLPm1\u20132 from A/Jilin/9/2004 strain (Fig. S3j online). Our results showed that TUDCA impaired M2 tetramer of both H5N1 IAV and iVLPm1\u20132 without an obvious impact on HA and M1 of authentic H5N1 IAV. Collectively, these data provide critical evidence that the effects of TUDCA are associated with M2.",

Similar to our in vitro data, TUDCA increased the survival rate of mice without detectable side effects (Fig. 4\na). Reduced body weight in infected mice improved in TUDCA-treated subjects (Fig. 4b). Lung injury scores based on H&E staining (Fig. 4c) indicated a 50% reduction of lung impairment in TUDCA-treated mice (Fig. 4d), and pulmonary edema in infected mice dramatically recovered in TUDCA-treated groups (Fig. 4e). These results indicate that TUDCA is a highly effective prophylactic treatment against IAV-induced disease. Conversely, when TUDCA treatment began 6 and 24 h after H5N1 exposure, both survival rate and body weight in the TUDCA-treated group was indistinguishable from the non-treated group (Fig. S4a, b online). These in vivo observations confirm TUDCA targets internalization rather than replication of IAV.",

Besides assembling and folding newly synthesized proteins, ER as intracellular bank of Ca2+ also regulates cytosolic Ca2+. Indeed, IAV infection induced cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in host cells, which was required for efficient IAV internalization [29]. Yet, details behind ER pathophysiology during IAV entry remain mostly unclear, it opens interesting questions \u2013 whether UPR activation induces detrimental or beneficial host responses following IAV infection and whether typical ER signals serve as indicators of viral virulence.",

First, it forms a liposome-like structure with measurable M2 proton channel activity. Second, iVLPm1\u20132 can penetrate freely into cells, probably through endocytic pathways. Third, the penetrating potential of iVLPm1\u20132 may rely on M2, which is likely endowed with a cell-penetrating competence. From the first identification of proteins that can move across cellular membranes, a group of proteins with similar features was classified as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [30]. One class of CPPs was identified comprising a high degree of amphipathicity, where AH is the most common structural motif [31]. In AH, hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids are usually grouped on separate faces of helix, with a highly hydrophobic patch on one face and a cationic patch on the other face. Penetration of CPPs containing AH is mainly due to the amphipathicity of AH [32]. Regarding M2, the existence of AH in C-terminus has been reported by several groups [15], [16], [33] and its putative function involves viral budding and scission [33], [34]. When expressed in host cells, AHs of M2, which are arranged parallel to membrane, partially penetrate themselves through its hydrophobic face mediating membrane deformation [35]. In this regard, it is plausible that AH of M2 utilizes a similar mechanism triggering IAV entry by inducing membrane curvature. However, due to being interior of IAV, it is more likely that AH of M2 reinforces the contact between the viral envelope and host membrane by a protruding viral envelope. The implication of M2 as CPP is by far not fully defined and additional work will be required to understand whether the CPP property of M2 is the nature of IAV entry.",

BA are facial amphiphiles, adopting an almost flat conformation with a rigid steroidal backbone in parallel with the interface, which allows contact of hydroxyl groups with the aqueous environment [36]. Typically, conjugated head groups of BAs are able to capture cationic species [37]. Our TEM and AFM data (Figs. 3f and S3f, g (online)) suggest that TUDCA may form a complex with M2, which inherited the flat conformation of BA. This complex may be composed of a hydrophobic interface of BA in parallel with a hydrophilic contact via electrostatic forces between positively charged M2 AH and negatively charged TUDCA. Thus, TUDCA reorganization of the M2 protein deforms the liposomal construct of iVLPm1\u20132, shown as strings of membranous debris. As binding features of BA usually appear above millimolar concentrations [37], this may explain the high doses of TUDCA required in this study.",
