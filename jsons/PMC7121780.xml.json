This reflects the similarity in therapeutic\napproach required for the final common physiology that follows from many different pathological processes. Since their\noriginal definitions and descriptions, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the two clinical\nconditions that have shaped health policy and dominated the research agenda in critical care [1, 2]. It is a truism to state that these are\nconglomerates of numerous different sub\u2010syndromes; to make this observation is simply to restate the definition of\nsepsis and ARDS as common patterns arising from numerous different injuries. But it is also clear that, if we take the\nsimple example of organ failure arising from a sterile versus an infectious insult, there is a very high likelihood that\npatients will respond differently to treatment with antibiotics. Or to take a more ambitious example, if we could\ndiagnose, at presentation, the infectious agent causing sepsis, we could then confidently treat with narrow spectrum\nantibiotics. In this way, sub\u2010classifications of critical illness are almost certainly directly applicable to clinical\npractice.",

Thus, critical care is contemplating approaches that are considered useful in cancer medicine and other\nclinical fields such as respiratory medicine, to inform clinical trials in sepsis and ARDS. However, the challenges with\nprecision medicine in the critically ill could be related to the classic paper by Geoffrey Rose; \u201cSick Individuals and\nSick Populations\u201d [3]. The key principle is that individual and population\napproaches to improving health achieve different aims: the individual approach aims to protect susceptible (high\u2010risk)\npatients, whereas the population approach aims to reduce the group level incidence of or outcome from diseases. In this\nshort perspective, after discussing the rationale for current definitions, we discuss whether the heterogeneity and\nprecision medicine concepts could inform future studies in sepsis and/or ARDS.",

ARDS is defined as acute onset hypoxemic respiratory\nfailure despite a positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O or greater, with non\u2010cardiogenic\npulmonary edema evidenced by bilateral chest opacities. With this definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS based on\nseverity of hypoxemia, were associated with significantly higher mortality and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation\nin survivors [2]. Sepsis is defined as life\u2010threatening organ dysfunction caused by\na dysregulated host response to infection, with organ dysfunction defined as an increase in the sequential organ failure\nassessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more [4]. Septic shock was defined as a subset\nof sepsis in which profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality\nthan with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean\narterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/l in the absence of hypovolemia\n[5]. With this definition, sepsis and septic shock were associated with significantly\nhigher mortality, compared to uncomplicated infection [1]. The predictive validity for\nmortality categories could potentially inform clinical care and trial design. For example, worsening ARDS severity has been\naligned with treatment options, with severe ARDS aligned with need for neuromuscular blockade, prone position and extracorporeal\nsupport [6].",

Identifying \u2013 and understanding \u2013 the genetic factors underlying predisposition may lead directly to tractable\ntherapeutic targets in the host [13]. Several strong associations with susceptibility\nto infections have been discovered (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], West Nile virus [WNV], tuberculosis, malaria,\ninfluenza, meningococcus) [14\u201316], but these tend to be highly pathogen\u2010specific. Whether there is general genetic\nsusceptibility to sepsis, or even more broadly to a deleterious response to sterile injury, remains an open question. However,\nseveral lines of evidence suggest that responses to critical illness are likely to exhibit heritable variation in human\npopulations. First, the consensus in critical care medicine, supported by many years of clinical and animal model research, is\nthat organ failure seen during critical illness is complex, driven by immune\u2010mediated injury and alterations in bioenergetics\n[17, 18], alongside individual\npredisposition discussed as patient heterogeneity. Second, immune phenotypes tend to be strongly heritable, and numerous genetic\nassociations for both autoimmune and infectious diseases have been discovered. Importantly, many of these disease associations are\npleiotropic [19]. Hence, variation in the host responses to severe systemic injury is\nlikely to be in part genetically\u2010determined. Finally, and most directly, the results of the Genomic Advances in Sepsis (GAinS) and\nGenoSept studies have discovered some genetic associations with outcome in sepsis [20], which will be important candidates for further biological investigation.",

A simple example for the impact of time on\ntreatment effect is the relationship between time to antibiotic treatment and outcome. In a cohort study, Seymour\net al. highlighted that in patients who had the 3\u2010hour Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle (blood culture, antibiotic therapy and\nmeasurement of lactate) completed within a 12\u2010hour period, every extra hour taken to complete the bundle was associated with\na significant increase in mortality [36]. Similarly, the treatment effect of drugs\nhas been shown to vary with illness severity, using activated protein C trials in sepsis and effect of PEEP in ARDS [37] as examples. A related concept in this context is heterogeneity in treatment response, which\nis a crude omnibus test for differences in responses to treatment and illness\u2010related outcomes arising from all factors\ncontributing to heterogeneity and stochasticity of risk. This has been illustrated using simulation of sepsis and ARDS RCTs\n[38] and by using completed RCT data from intravenous immunoglobulin trials in sepsis\n[39]. As the risk of death changes in a trial population, the differences in\nmortality between the intervention arm and the usual arm also changes. This could potentially highlight a risk of outcome\u2010specific\nsubgroups within ARDS and sepsis who are likely to benefit the most from the intervention.",

For example, in children with septic shock,\nusing a 100\u2010gene profile and serum protein biomarkers, it is possible to identify two patient subsets, with different outcomes,\nand differential responses to corticosteroid treatment [41]. Similarly, in adults\nwith septic shock, corticosteroid responders can be identified using a three\u2010biomarker panel [42]. Similarly, ARDS subsets, which respond differently to ventilator and fluid management, have\nbeen identified using data from completed ARDS trials [32, 33].",
