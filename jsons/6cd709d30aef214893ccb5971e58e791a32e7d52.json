First, up to $50 billion of rapid-disbursement funding is available for LMICs, which need not have an existing full-fledged IMF programme. 2 Second, countries can apply for catastrophe containment and relief trust support, designed to assist with pandemics; this fund has about $400 million available thus far and might increase further. By early April, only four countries had received support from either instrument, and the IMF's principal response has been more of the same: urging crisis-stricken countries to apply for conventional loans, albeit with greater flexibility in funding-up to $1 trillion is reportedly available. These loans are subject to controversial conditionalities-reforms that must be introduced before money is disbursed. Such conditionalities have adverse effects on population health because they include ill-designed policy measures such as budget cuts, reducing the number and wages of health and social workers, weakening workforce protections, or promoting privatisations. 3 The World Bank has announced a $14 billion package of fast-track assistance, and hopes to deploy up to $160 billion over the next 15 months. 4 Rather than using its Health, Nutrition, and Population Division, with its expertise in health, the bulk of this support ($8 billion) will channel through the International Finance Corporation, the Bank's private sector financing arm. This arm has been chosen despite its absence of expertise in building public health systems, and the accumulated evidence of the poor (and costly) results of public-private partnerships in health. 5 Acceptance of World Bank (or IMF) loans would also saddle countries with additional debt repayments that will continue to drain money from health systems.",

Yet it is unclear whether this will strengthen public health systems that are struggling now or instead finance private health services that might take much needed staff from them. 4 The latter seems more likely, for two reasons. First, the $2 billion that the International Finance Corporation will disburse via its Real Sector Crisis Response Facility envisages, among others, loans to private companies in the health-care sector. Second, World Bank President David Malpass clarified that his institution's support will be conditional on structural adjustment policies mandating deregulation (eg, by promoting private markets in health) or trade liberalisation. 6 Once again, both the IMF and parts of the World Bank are pursuing policies that will have adverse consequences on health outcomes 7 because they prioritise fiscal objectives and market-driven solutions.

Governments will benefit from additional sources of fiscal space for public health systems, from larger fiscal deficits to wealth or other taxes. Capital controls can stop destabilising mass outflows that put pressure on governments' financing costs, and the IMF can assist countries instituting them. 9 Fourth, there must be an immediate debt moratorium to public and private creditors, such as those being implemented in some high-income countries, channelling funds to deal with the pandemic. 10 For decades, international financial institutions have pursued policies that undermine public health systems, allowing billions of people to remain without adequate health care.
