            "text": "With the advancement in the field of nanotechnology, \u2018Nanovaccines\u2019 have been explored by combining pathogen-specific antigens with synthetic or natural nanomaterials in an effort to elicit controlled immune response. This requires the use of necessary components of the pathogen known as subunits to make vaccines more tunable and safer. Such subunits can be peptides, proteins, membranes, polysaccharides, capsules and toxins. Vaccines comprising of these subunits possess more safety, controlled immune response and protection against diverse pathogenic strains [2]. In addition, nanoparticles have the ability to impart more stability with high antigen loading and less proteasomal degradation of antigenic subunits. Small and more specific subunits often tend to be less immunogenic, which can be overcome by the use of adjuvants that produce co-immunostimulatory or immunomodulatory signals. Side effects associated with such conventional adjuvants with individual-specific response, immunotolerance to the target antigen and unwanted reactions towards self-antigens limit their use [3]. Therefore, biocompatible nanoparticles can also be directly used as adjuvants and may mitigate the need of strong conventional adjuvants (e.g., alum). Another reason associated with low subunit immunogenicity is their low cellular internalization and rapid clearance from the body. Nanoparticles with tunable physicochemical properties can overcome this limitation by enhancing circulation time, bio-accumulation in lymphoid organs and efficient targeting of immune cells. They can also increase cross-presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activate the immune system at much lower doses. For instance, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles enhanced the cross presentation of ovalbumin through major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) in bone marrow derived primary dendritic cells due to which T cells were stimulated at 1000-fold lower concentrations as compared to soluble antigen [4].",

Most of the synthetic nanoparticles interact with APCs structurally to increase internalization rather than functionally as they lack specific binding locations for cell receptors. On the contrary, protein-based nanoparticles can interact both structurally and functionally as they can carry antigens as well as interact with the pattern associated receptors on APCs [6]. Nanovaccines have the ability to induce both the components of human adaptive immunity i.e. cell-mediated as well as antibody-mediated immunity with induction of memory response. Prolonged release of antigens from nanoparticle depots can cause enhanced stimulation for a long period of time, alleviating the need for frequent booster doses and therefore, nanovaccines can be used as both prophylactic or therapeutic which involves its administration before or after the occurrence of the disease respectively. However, the safety, biodistribution and residence of the nanoparticles must be optimized to obtain preferred immune responses towards nanoparticle-based vaccines.",

            "text": "Prophylactic nanovaccines are generally administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intranasally whereas therapeutic vaccines (e.g. for cancer treatment) are injected intravenously. Depending on the route of immunization, nanovaccines first encounter immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, DCs and natural killer (NK) cells which quickly recognize the nanovaccine (foreign particle) based on the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with them [15]. PAMPs (e.g. bacterial LPS, teichoic acid, lectins, oligonucleotides or material from the carrier nanoparticle etc.) serve as the ligands for PRRs [e.g. toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs) etc.] abundantly present on these cells [16,17]. Thus, interaction of PAMPs with PRR trigger endocytosis of larger particles (usually >500 nm) preferentially by macrophages and smaller particles by DCs. Engulfment of nanovaccines by macrophages results in gradual degradation of nanovaccine particles and the encapsulated antigens. To prevent this, nanovaccine particles have been engineered to survive the attack by macrophages and facilitate direct delivery to APCs [18,19]. Additionally, depending on the type of PAMPs, neutrophils and macrophage secrete a variety of cytokines and chemokines which further activate APCs. Besides PAMPs, there are several unknown mechanisms which can activate innate immunity for example, induction of immune responses (potential adjuvant effect) by glycolic acid component of PLGA co-polymer [20] or by cationic liposomes [21]. Eventually, the secreted cytokines and chemokines stimulate maturation and activation of APCs (mainly DCs) which initiate strong adaptive immune response (refer Fig. 1). Therapeutic nanovaccines developed for treatment of metastatic cancer directly target DCs for strengthening adaptive immune responses in body [22]. Activated DCs serve as the link between innate and adaptive immunity.",

The CMI responses are triggered by migration of activated DCs (following uptake of nanovaccine particle) to lymphatic organs (spleen and lymph noted). Activated DCs present their antigens via MHC class I receptor to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (refer Fig. 1). Activated CTLs elicit strong CMI and selectively kill target cells (infected altered cells or cancerous cell) by inducing apoptosis in them [20]. Killing target cells is a complex immunological process that attracts several compliment systems (CS) proteins and co-stimulatory molecules. Therapeutic cancer nanovaccines are preferentially designed to strengthen CTLs responses by ex vivo educating DCs via adoptive transfer of antigen (for example, Sipuleucel-T, a therapeutic vaccine approved for treatment of metastatic contraction resistant prostate cancer) [25].",

Subsequently, effector Th cells undergo activation and maturation leading to secretion of variety of cytokines signals (refer Fig. 1). Depending on the type of cytokine secreted, Th populations are divided into Th1 cells and Th2 cells subsets [7]. Th1 subset majorly secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1) which stimulates proliferation of CTLs and strengthen the function of CMI. Th2 subset secrete class of cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13) which stimulate B cell proliferation during antibody-mediated immune responses [7,26]. A subtle balance between Th1/Th2 responses determines overall therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine potential of candidate nanovaccine [27]. In some cases, nanovaccines also work by suppressing T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which naturally suppress activation and proliferation of effector T cells in the body [28].",

            "text": "Plasma cells are short-lived and their number gradually declines over time, as do the corresponding antibody titers [30]. In that case, memory cells (B cells and T cells) which were generated and stored in the lymphatic organs or bone marrow for several months, come into play and protect the body from reinfection of the same antigen. In such situations, memory B cells quickly proliferate and turn to antibody-secreting (mainly IgG) plasma cells to neutralize the antigen. On the other hand, memory T cells (both types CD4+ and CD8+) serve to produce more cytokine and chemokine signals to stimulate enhanced CMI and antibody-mediated responses. However, in case the structure of the antigen (epitope) has undergone significant changes due to cleavage, aggregation or re-folding, even memory cells cannot provide the required protection [31]. Although, in some cases, primary immunization can offer up to 90% protection, however, as even the rest 10% can be disastrous, therefore booster doses are scheduled to increase protection up to 100% [32]. Booster doses promote generating of more population and a variety of memory cells. Generally, booster doses are scheduled after the antibody titer from plasma cells has dramatically declined to allow more competitive binding of memory cells to the injected antigen [33,34]. In a related context, the use of nanoparticles help recalling more robust immunological memory even at a low dose [35]. Nanoparticles (e.g. PLGA based nanovaccine) facilitate prolonged availability of intact antigen in blood due to sustained release that leads to a higher proliferation of B cells and hence more memory cells [36,37]. Also due to small size, nanoparticles can travel through the narrow lymphatic system to lymph nodes inducing differentiation of more memory cells [38]. For example, Demento et al., reported that over alum-based (free antigen) or liposome-based (burst release) carriers, mice immunized with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LM-OVA) encapsulated in PLGA particles (sustained-release) showed the highest protection against a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes even after 13 weeks post immunization. They observed that mice immunized with antigen in PLGA nanoparticles had a robust population of CD8+ T memory cells [36]. Similarly, Kanchan et al., showed that encapsulation of tetanus toxoid (TT) inside poly(lactic acid) (PLA) particles generated long lasting primary antibody response in mice and interestingly even after 18 months re-exposing the animal using very low antigen dose induced heightened and robust B cell responses [39].",

Adjuvants activate innate immune responses that shape and trigger the adaptive immune responses to vaccines [41]. Traditionally used adjuvants such as alum, complete Freund's adjuvant and AS04 (combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A) are known to form local depots that induce secretion of cytokines, chemokines and recruitment of immune cells. Absorption of antigen on surface of adjuvants enhances antigen uptake and presentation, thus promoting antigen transport to draining lymph nodes [42]. Activation of TLRs has been potentially used for designing vaccine adjuvants. TLR ligands or agonists have served as potential immunostimulatory molecules as TLRs activate innate immune responses by identifying PAMPs and down signaling the transcription factors responsible for immune responses such as NF-\u03baB, IRFs and lymphocyte activation [43]. The co-delivery of antigen along with TLR ligands promotes antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells via MHC-II signaling and cross-presentation to activate CD8+ T cells [44]. TLR agonist such as CpG up-regulates expression of CD40, CD54, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II molecules thus enhancing antigen processing and presentation in plasmacytoid DCs [45].",

            "text": "Vaccine antigens are either encapsulated inside or surface decorated over nanoparticles to get delivered efficiently (refer Fig. 2\n). There are chances that free antigens may degrade and elicit local immune responses at the site of administration, therefore, encapsulating free antigen inside nanoparticles prevents their degradation and provides prolonged and controlled release at the target site. The controlled release of antigen prevents burst responses and eliminates the need of booster doses. Surface decoration of nanoparticles with antigen also confers the advantage of presenting the antigen to cells in a similar way as presented by pathogens [46]. Polyanhydride-based nanoparticles encapsulating F1-V antigen when administered intranasally induced an immune response that persisted for 23 weeks and elicited a high anti-F1-V IgG1 antibody response post-vaccination and conferred long-lived protective immunity against Yersinia pestis infections compared to recombinant F1-V antigen [47]. Similar nanoparticles were functionalized with di-mannose targeted macrophage mannose receptor (MMR). These carbohydrate functionalized nanoparticles enabled sustained release of immunogen for 30 days and enhanced the uptake of antigen by dendritic cells simultaneously upregulating the co-stimulatory molecule CLR, CD206, and CD40 in cells as compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles [48]. Apart from encapsulation, several other strategies have been exploited for the co-delivery of antigens and nanoparticle such as surface absorption, conjugation, and mixture (refer Fig. 2). Nevagi et al., observed enhanced immune activation against GAS (Group A Streptococcus) antigen using tri-methyl chitosan (TMC) nanoparticle conjugated with B cell and T cell epitope as compared to antigen mixed with TMC [49].",

Due to above-mentioned effects, nanoparticles act as a better adjuvant in comparison to complete Freund's adjuvant and conventional aluminum containing salts by inducing higher immunogenic responses at low antigen doses [51]. Also, their small size facilitates internalization by dendritic cells and induces adaptive immune responses. Studies by Swaminathan et al., have proved enhanced immune responses by lipid nanoparticle (LNP) adjuvant formulations against ovalbumin (OVA) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice injected with HBsAg along with LNPs as compared to HBsAg alone [52]. Co-administration of quarternized chitosan nanoparticles as adjuvants along with ovalbumin intranasally in female BALB/c mice induced activation of APCs followed by enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation as compared to OVA mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel [53]. Asgary et al., also reported that silver nanoparticles showed increased antibody-mediated responses against CVS-11 rabies and reduced toxicity as compared to conventionally used adjuvants such as alum [54]. Although nanoparticles possess great adjuvant properties, their co-delivery along with generally used adjuvants such as TLR agonists can provide very robust immune protection. The use of TLR agonists is restricted because of their instability, particularly while using RNA as TLR agonists. Nugyen et al., have designed lipidoids to effectively deliver immunostimulatory RNA to activate innate and adaptive immune responses. These lipid-RNA nanoparticles enhanced IFN-\u03b3 responses and anti-OVA cell-mediated and antibody-mediated responses. These lipidoids were superior to the conventionally used N- [1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-tri-methyl ammonium methyl sulfate\u2013RNA delivery system [55]. Similarly, Siefert et al., have synthesized PLGA based bacterial biomimetic nanoparticles co-presenting monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA) and unmethylated CpG-rich oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), a TLR agonist. These nanoparticles induced pro inflammatory responses and antigen-specific antibody and cell-mediated immunity. Co-localization of MPLA and CpG also induced functional memory CD8+ cells. These findings clearly demonstrated the ability of bacterial elements and TLR agonists towards developing a more effective vaccine design [56]. In addition, TLR agonists have been used in designing disease-specific nanovaccines, which are discussed later in this review.",

Mice vaccination and intranasal boosting showed antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.

A recent study on non-viral E2 protein-based biomimetic nanoparticle-containing acid-labile CpG (DC activating molecule) and SIINFEKL peptide epitope conjugate has shown the potential to enhance the CpG mediated DC activation by 25-fold in vitro as compared to unbound CpG. Interestingly, co-delivery of SIINFEKL peptide conjugated with CpG has shown elevated cross-presentation and CD8+ T cell activation by inducing a 3-fold greater display of SIINFEKL on MHC-I by DCs as compared to unbound peptide or peptide bound directly to E2 protein. This shows the ability of biomimetic protein-based nanoparticles to facilitate enhanced immune response by DC activation and cross-presentation [62].",

Comparative adjuvant activity of mono mycoloyl glycerol-1 (MMG-1) immunopotentiator containing hexosomes and cationic liposomes (CAF04) loaded with Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP) antigen in CB6/F1 mice after vaccination was studied by Rodrigues et al. MMG-1 hexosomes made up of lipid phytantriol induced a strong MOMP-specific antibody-mediated immune response whereas MMG-1 cationic liposomes elicited much stronger MOMP-specific cell-mediated response. It indicated the immune activation by two lipid-based adjuvants via different mechanisms [95]. In addition, cubosomes are generally made up of lipid bilayers forming continuous periodic cubic lattice structures with interwoven water channels and a stabilizing polymeric outer corona [96]. Phytantriol, pluronic F127 and propylene glycol-based cubosome formulation containing (imiquimod and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)) adjuvants and model OVA antigen elicited robust IFN-\u03b3 production and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation as compared to similar adjuvant containing liposomal formulation and alum [97].

Abundance of silanol groups over silica nanoparticle surface provides an advantage for easy conjugation of targeting moiety for various viral infections [118]. Silica vesicles adsorbing E2 glycoprotein of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) showed 6-month antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune response with no histopathological changes at the site of infection [119]. The use of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) through phospholipid functionalization of TACA glycopeptide showed enhanced antibody titers against both human and mouse tumor cells expressing that glycopeptide [120]. Calcium nanoparticles have also been reported for their superior adjuvant property with DNA vaccines and to confer mucosal immunity. They can also induce enhanced antibody production against viral antigens as compared to aluminum adjuvants [121].",

Though clear demarcation or direct comparison across nanocarriers has not been studied but there are unique properties and advantages associated with each nanocarrier that gives them an edge over each other. Biomimetic carriers like VLPs are expected to possess inherent immunogenicity that can elicit antibody reaction against carrier antigens itself. This could lead to the competition with the target antigen and alter antibody repertoire or memory response against it. Reactive toxicities or neutralization upon repeated dosing can also limit their multiple use in a patient [122]. Such problems can be avoided by the use of nanoclusters that are solely made up of single type of antigen. These protein-based biomimetic and rationally designed nanocarriers are most suitable for the incorporation of a highly hydrophobic antigens of varied sizes with an intent to preserve its native structure, whereas hydrophilic peptides can be well delivered using amphiphilic micelles [6]. Carrier specific immune response has also been observed for certain polymeric and lipid-based carriers but it can be avoided using natural or biomimetic components (e.g., cellular lipid isolates or extracellular matrix polymers) [6]. Control over spatiotemporal antigen release, biodegradability, biocompatibility and ease of modification makes them two of the most widely explored nanocarriers for vaccine development. Precise control over size with high reproducibility and ease of antigen functionalization gives inorganic nanoparticles an edge over other nanocarriers but reports suggesting their dose-dependent clinical toxicity because of prolonged exposure limits their potential use. Different examples of nanoparticle-based vaccines and their current clinical status has been summarized in Table 1\n.",

To address this, Ansari et al., have synthesized archeosomes encapsulating a T cell antigen Rv3619c, that upon immunization elicited type-1 cytokine response in mice. Also, it increased the production of IgG2a antibodies, antigen-specific T lymphocytes and enhanced expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of APCs. By the virtue of all these properties, vaccination with archeosomes containing antigen reduced mycobacterial burden in the lungs and spleen of animals upon challenging with Mtb [135]. Similarly, self-assembled peptide nanofibers, when loaded with T cell epitope, also showed similar responses by inducing corresponding effector memory T cells and increasing cytotoxic T cell population in the lungs upon intranasal immunization. Mice vaccinated with co-assembly of nanofibers containing CD8+ T cell epitopes and TLR2 agonists in the lungs increased the expansion of multi-functional cytotoxic T cell population. On further challenge with Mtb, significant reduction in lung bacterial load was observed in comparison to BCG primed mice [67]. In another study, Mtb lipid-based nanovaccines were used wherein chitosan nanoparticles bound with Mtb lipids induced cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity by secretion of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) and prominent Th1 and Th2 cytokines in lymph node and spleen cells [136].",

Mice were immunized with free antigens and liposome-encapsulated antigen, further challenging mice 16 weeks post immunization with Mtb, it was observed that Mtb burden in the lungs and spleen was significantly less in mice immunized with liposome-encapsulated antigen as compared to free BCG vaccine [137]. The potential of nanoparticles in augmenting the prophylactic activity of antigens against TB was well understood and human trials were initiated.

For example, codon harmonized Pfs25 (CHrPfs25) has been used with gold nanoparticles as adjuvants for the induction of immunity against transmission. Strong transmission-blocking antibodies elicited by simultaneous delivery of CHrPfs25 with gold nanoparticles could be due to the co-ingestion of nanoparticles and antigen by immune cells [112]. Similarly, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged (his-tagged) Pfs25 when mixed with preformed co-porphyrin containing liposomes at the time of immunization resulted in spontaneous nanoliposome antigen particularization (SNAP). Immunization of mice and rabbits with SNAP resulted in higher functional antibody generation as compared with other \u2018mix-and-inject\u2019 adjuvants.

            "text": "Three types of influenza viruses A, B and C have different viral nucleoproteins and matrix proteins giving rise to variable antigenic differences among them. Influenza virus A and B cause epidemics attacking both adults and children, causing around 5 million infections annually [145]. Presently, two types of vaccines are used against influenza based on strain A and strain B that target and produce antibody-mediated protective responses against hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. These antigens are highly prone to antigenic shift and drift due to error-prone RNA dependent RNA replication in influenza [146,147]. Due to environmental selection and antigenic variations, chances of influenza epidemic still persists [148]. Although animal influenza virus is distinct from the human virus, zoonotic animal viruses can still occasionally infect humans through direct/indirect contact. Avian and swine influenza viruses have been known to infect humans in some countries. Thus, there is an unmet need for producing more efficient vaccines that can provide both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity to confront homologous and heterologous variants [149]. Association of various influenza antigens with nanoparticles have shown promising preliminary results in providing enhanced immune responses against variable influenza antigens.",

Similarly, Ross et al., have shown that intranasal or subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c mice with polyanhydride nanoparticles encapsulated H53 induced high titer neutralizing antibodies. Also, significantly higher CD4+ T cell expansion was observed in vaccinated mice as compared to non-vaccinated mice, thus providing cell-mediated and antibody-mediated protective immunity to mice. Mice were further challenged intranasally with A/H5N1 VNH5N1-PR8CDC-RG influenza virus at 63 days post immunization and viral load was significantly reduced as compared to saline-administered mice [152]. It has also been demonstrated that the polyanhydride nanoparticles give equivalent responses at 64-fold lower doses as compared to free antigen [153]. Also, encapsulation of antigen in polyanhydride nanovaccines exhibited stability of antigen for one year at room temperature, thus providing a major benefit for maintaining stocks of pandemic vaccines [154].",

Due to antigenic variations, multiple strains of influenza virus have emerged over the years posing serious public threats, indicating the need for a universal vaccine, which includes broad cross-presentation against multiple strains of influenza to reduce community threats. Insights into the structural properties of antigens or peptides can be further explored for the rational designing of broad-spectrum nanovaccines using multiple antigens. On similar lines, to increase the breadth and potency of nanovaccines, Deng et al., have designed double-layered protein nanoparticles. The core of the protein nanoparticles (4MtG) contains four types of M2e from human (huM2e), swine (swnM2e), avian (aviM2e), and domestic fowl (fwlM2e) viral consensus sequences coated with HA variants hrH1 and hrH3 (refer Fig. 5\n). Mice were immunized intramuscularly with Uni4MC (PNp), Uni4C1 (hrH1-coated double-layer PNp) and Uni4C3 (hrH3-coated double-layer PNp) and Uni4C13 (Cocktail of Uni4C1 and Uni4C3). Robust antibody-mediated responses were generated and induced M2e antibodies were strongly cross-reactive to diverse antigens. Also, Uni4C13 group produced broad cellular responses by significantly inducing more IFN-\u03b3 secreting splenocytes after stimulation with diverse antigen peptides. Na\u00efve mice were vaccinated with sera from pre-immunized mice with DPBS, Uni4MC, or Uni4C13 and then challenged intranasally with PR8 or Aic after 24 hours. Sera from Uni4C13 immunized mice prevented the mice from a viral infection, indicating the role of serum antibodies. Also, antibodies specific to human M2e, PR8, and Aic were viable for four months after the immunization in mice and implied long-lasting protection [155].",

HIV infection causes systemic depletion of CD4+ T cells, hence compromising the activity of the immune system and the development of AIDS. Immune functions can be preserved in the early stages of HIV by using antiretroviral therapy (ART). It targets the HIV life cycle, but the major challenge is strict adherence to complex ART regimens. This necessitates the urgent need for the development of a prophylactic vaccine against HIV. The most recent and promising HIV vaccine RV144 is in the phase III trial [156]. IgG antibodies raised against V1V2 loop were inversely correlated with the risk of infection in the clinical trial of RV144 [157]. SAPN-based vaccine reduces the need for essential glycosylation of the HIV-1 Env V1V2 loop to form a native-like structure to act as potential immunogen [157]. Although self-assembling VLPs as vectors have shown great potential in the development of immunity against HIV, anti-vector immunity is a significant concern. Here, synthetic nanoparticles offer versatile platform technologies that can induce strong adaptive immune responses while avoiding anti vector immunity and toxicity issues [156].",

Nanovaccines shifted the immune response towards Th1 polarization and enhanced the Th1 cytokine pattern [158]. Recently, protease cleavage sites (PCS) has been utilized as a strategy to hamper the maturation and infectivity of HIV. Due to low immunogenicity of peptide antigens, they have been crosslinked with chitosan and hyaluronic based nano-formulation. Nanoparticles containing PCS showed enhanced activation of APCs and the production of anti-PCS antibody. Also, these nanoparticles generated memory T cells at longer time points after the last booster dose, indicating their capacity to elicit a good immune response upon infection [159]. Silver nanoparticles coated with amantadine triggered the production of HIV specific CTLs in the spleen of mice with 8-fold stronger TNF-\u03b1 production in vivo. The co-culture of these HIV specific CTLs with HIV infected cells in vitro enhanced the death of infected cells and reduced the production of HIV [160]. Similarly, HIV-1 peptide and oligosaccharide loaded AuNPs enhanced antigen presentation to isolated T cells from HIV-1 patients. Treatment with AuNP formulated vaccine increased proliferation of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with increased secretion of pro-Th1 cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro\n[161].",

Immunization of mice with protein nanoparticles conjugated to melanoma-associated epitope gp100 and CpG adjuvant enhanced the production of melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells. Pre-immunization with nanoparticles delayed onset of tumor growth and increased the survival rate to 40%, showing prophylactic potential of protein nanoparticles [59]. Luo et al., showed strong cytotoxic T cell response by a physical mixture of PC7A polymeric nanoparticle and OVA antigen. This was achieved by enhanced cytosolic delivery and antigen presentation in APCs of draining lymph node by PC7A NPs and activation of type-I interferon stimulating genes. Nanovaccines showed tumor growth inhibition in melanoma, human papilloma virus E6/E7 tumor and colon cancer models. The combination of anti-PD1 with PC7A NPs showed synergism with 100% survival in a TC-1 model over 60 days. Further, re-challenging of tumor-free mice with TC-1 cells after immunization with PC7A nanoparticles and anti-PD1 showed complete tumor growth inhibition. This indicates the prophylactic response of nanovaccine by generating long-term anti-tumor memory [46]. Liu et al., developed a unique prophylactic nanovaccines using metallo-organic nanoparticles (MOF) coated with fused membrane (FM) of dendritic cells and cancer cells. Presence of whole tumor antigens and immunological co-stimulatory molecules on its cytomembranes impart them APC like properties for cancer specific T cell immuno-activation. Since, fusion of DC and cancer membrane is accompanied by DC maturation, MOF@FM nanovaccines possessed lymph node homing molecules. Therefore, enhanced retention and homing of MOF@FM in lymph nodes and spleen as compared to only cancer membrane fused (MOF@CM) and dendritic cell membrane fused (MOF@DM) nanovaccines was observed. Pre-immunization of mice with MOF@FM has significantly prevented the development of 4T1 tumors by promoting differentiation of CD8+ T cell precursors into cytotoxic T cells with enhanced generation of IFN-\u0263 and IL-6 immuno-stimulatory cytokines (refer Fig. 6\n) [77].",

The steady rise in antibiotic resistance and lack of curative cancer therapy because of continuous causative strain variations and cancer heterogeneity respectively drives the focus towards personalized therapeutics. Hence, on similar lines, vaccines against bacterial infections and tumors could benefit significantly, but the current vaccine's antigenic breadth and lack of potency are the limiting factors. Therefore, researchers have recently shifted towards biomimetic nanotechnology to develop biomimetic nanovaccines as personalized medicines. Such nanovaccines can be inherently immuno-stimulatory and multi-antigenic. Coating of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) onto nanoparticles for anti-virulence vaccination to deliver and neutralize bacterial toxins outplays the pathogen by utilizing its own survival mechanism. This can prevent bacterial colonization effectively and reduce direct selective pressure to develop antibiotic resistance. A large number of such nano-toxoid formulations can be developed by varying the outer membrane coating of these biomimetic nanovaccines [213]. Despite the advancements in the field of cancer nano-based immunotherapy, the major challenge is the toxicological assessments of these nanovaccines. Prior evaluation of autoimmune side effects generated from nanovaccine induced immune activation needs to be done. Over-activation of antigen presenting cells by nanovaccine can prove to be detrimental as it may cause the death of dendritic cells [47]. Last but not least, increased complexity, cost of manufacturing, and commercialization hurdle related to nanovaccine therapy requires strategies to minimize these limitations for the successful translation of nano-based immunotherapy.",
