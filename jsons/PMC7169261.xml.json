The scope of this review includes the four genera that have been associated with human disease, ie, Orthohantaviruses, Orthonairoviruses, Orthobunyaviruses, and Phleboviruses (Figure 1).",

Yet, it is important to step up to the challenge since these emerging human viruses are now spread over more than 80 countries in Europe, Asia, Middle East, America, and Africa.3 The great diversity and continuous emergence of new bunyaviral species that cause severe disease make it unfeasible to develop drugs or vaccines for every single virus. Therefore, comprehensive efforts towards the development of antiviral drugs with an extended efficacy against an entire virus family or even virus order need to be made. These offer protection against not only the (re)emerging viruses of today but also from the pandemic threats of tomorrow. To aid in such efforts, we here review the available knowledge of potential druggable targets in the replication cycle of these viruses together with current available tools and models.",

The manganese\u2010dependent endonuclease domain of bunyaviruses is located at the N\u2010terminus of the L\u2010protein, with exception of the nairoviruses where it is located more downstream (Figure 3A).13, 14 The aa similarity of the endonuclease domain of species within the four studied bunyaviral families is 50% to 80% conserved, whereas between families, this is 30% to 45%. The degree of similarity with the arena and influenza domains is 28% to 45% and 22% to 38%, respectively (Figures 3B and S2). However, within the active site of these domains, there are motifs that are highly conserved (H..E/D..PD..E/D).15 Their crucial function and conserved regions makes such domains a suitable target for antiviral endeavors. Successes have already been achieved against the endonuclease of influenza, confirming this enzyme is indeed a druggable target.16 Such compounds include endonuclease inhibitors pimodivir/JNJ872 (formally VX\u2010787), which is active against a diverse panel of influenza A virus strains and influenza JNJ5806 (formally AL\u2010794) (J&J/Alios) and S\u2010033188 (Shionogi).17 This not only shows that the endonuclease is a viable drug target but its conservation among strains and species may also indicate possibilities for the development of pan\u2010bunya inhibitors.

In fact, some polymerase\u2010targeting broad\u2010acting antiviral drugs have been reported. Galidesivir (BCX4430, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals) is an adenosine nucleoside RdRp\u2010inhibitor currently being developed against filoviruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Marburg virus), also exerts activity against coronaviruses, picornaviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses.18 GS\u20105734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, is being developed as anti\u2010filovirus drug. Its acting range includes also flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses, but not bunyaviruses or arenaviruses.19 Also favipiravir/T\u2010705 exerts a wide range of anti\u2010RNA\u2013virus inhibition, including some minor activity against bunyaviruses.20 The antiviral activity of favipiravir is discussed in more detail in Section 4. The similarities between the polymerases of bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, and influenza viruses, ie, their common motifs and similar architecture, could point in the direction of a common ancestor.6 From an antiviral prospective, this could be a very interesting notion, since a single drug might be able to target them all.",

The viral L\u2010protein catalyzes primary transcription of viral mRNAs, which will translate into new structural proteins and (depending on the species) nonstructural proteins. The three negative\u2010sense vRNA segments are converted into positive\u2010sense cRNA that will serve as template for novel RNPs. These will be transported to the Golgi complex where it will interact with newly translated glycoproteins to commence assembly processes.
