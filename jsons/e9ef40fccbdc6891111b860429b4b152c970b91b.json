            "text": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor/transcription factor that modulates several cellular and immunological processes following activation by pathogen-associated stimuli, though its role during virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1\u2424 (IL-1\u2424), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1 \u03ea/\u03ea macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.",

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototypic CoV, causes hepatitis and/or encephalitis, depending on the strain. Previous studies have detailed many of the cellular pathways critical for or elicited by MHV infection (1, 2) . Several antiviral mechanisms are induced by MHV infection, but MHV encodes proteins that counter these host processes. For instance, interferons (IFNs), especially type I IFNs (IFN-I), are vital to limiting MHV infection in mice (3, 4) , but IFN-I production and signaling are inhibited during MHV infection in multiple cell types (5) (6) (7) . MHV also inhibits the functions of downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). For example, the MHV macrodomain, a virus-encoded ADP-ribosylhydrolase, reverses cellular ADP ribosylation by IFN-I-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that limit viral replication (8, 9) .",

While initially believed to operate only in the context of the cellular response to toxins, AhR is now recognized as a significant regulator of the host immune response, as well. AhR in the cytosol is activated by binding ligands that are exogenous, such as the toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), or endogenous, such as cellular metabolites (Fig. 1 ). This triggers AhR translocation to the nucleus, where AhR complexes with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) or other binding partners to induce expression of several different proteins (downstream effectors) responsible for degrading the xenobiotic agent and for limiting potential cellular damage. Upregulated genes include those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) that catabolize exotoxin, negatively regulating AhR activation by depleting AhR ligands (10) . Another inhibitory protein, the AhR repressor (AhRR), is also upregulated and competes with ARNT for AhR dimerization in the nucleus (11) . PARP7, also known as TCDD-inducible PARP (TiPARP), is highly induced by AhR activation, as well, indicating a relationship to cellular ADP ribosylation. TiPARP is responsible for mitigating pathology after TCDD administration to mice, at least in part due to feedback inhibition of AhR (12) .",

The prototypical endogenous ligand is kynurenine, a tryptophan catabolite produced by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) or IDO2 in immune cells or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) (encoded by the TDO2 gene) in the liver (13, 14) . IDO1, the best characterized of these enzymes, is induced by inflammatory factors, such as IFN-I or IFN-II, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u2424), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (15) . AhR also activates IDO1 expression and enhances its activity through multiple pathways (16) , and the resulting IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positivefeedback loop prolongs the effects of AhR activation (17, 18) . Though kynurenine is believed to be the predominant derivative of tryptophan that drives AhR activation, multiple other degradation products of tryptophan or other biomolecules are synthesized independently of IDO1/2 or TDO or can be sourced from the gut microflora, diet, or even UV-mediated photo-oxidation (19) . Prostaglandins, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and oxidative species may also activate AhR, though with unknown physiological or pathological significance (20) (21) (22) .",

AhR has also been shown to bind to and modulate the transcription specificity of NF-B in multiple experimental settings, which could contribute to cytokine modulation (30, (33) (34) (35) . Other studies have shown that AhR activation in immune cells is driven by IDO1, and the resulting IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positivefeedback loop helps to establish immunotolerance (18, 36, 37) . In contrast, less is known about the role of AhR during virus infection. While previous work has explored pathways affected by AhR activation during influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (38) (39) (40) (41) , the virological impact of AhR is still largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that CoV replication in macrophages results in AhR activation in an IDO1-independent manner, leading to increased expression of several downstream effectors and to modulation of the cytokine response.

Infection of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with the neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) results in increased expression of several IFN-I-inducible PARPs (PARP7, -9 through -12, and -14) (8). However, PARP7 (TiPARP) was also induced during MHV-JHM infection of IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs, suggesting that other factors besides IFN-I mediate TiPARP upregulation during infection (8) . To expand on these results, we infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma cells ( Fig.  2A ) or 17Cl-1 fibroblast-like cells (Fig. 2B) , both of which minimally produce IFN during MHV infection (6, 7) , with the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59). We used MHV-A59 because it replicates to higher titers than MHV-JHM in vitro (42) . Upregulation of most PARPs, including PARP9, -11, -12, and -14, was lost or attenuated in these cell lines during infection, contrasting with the robust PARP upregulation profile seen in MHV-A59-infected wild-type (WT) BMDMs (Fig. 2C ). Despite the diminished expression of many IFN-dependent PARPs, TiPARP was highly upregulated following MHV-A59 infection in all three cell types, suggesting a conserved mechanism of induction. Furthermore, induction of TiPARP in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs was conserved after infection with MHV-A59, consistent with previous findings with MHV-JHM (Fig. 2D ). Although not further studied here, PARP13 was also upregulated in infected IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea cells. Overall, these results indicate that TiPARP is upregulated by another pathway during infection in the absence of IFN-I signaling.",

We previously noted that viral genomic RNA (gRNA) levels during MHV-JHM infection were reduced in BMDMs treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed toward TiPARP (8) . To confirm this phenotype, we treated BMDMs with TiPARP-specific siRNA prior to infection with MHV-A59 at low (0.1 PFU/cell) and high (5 PFU/cell) multiplicities of infection (MOI) and measured replication by quantification of viral genomic content and infectious virus (Fig. 3) . At low MOI at 12 h postinfection (hpi), TiPARP knockdown decreased viral gRNA levels ( Fig.  3A) and titers (Fig. 3B) , though the former only trended toward statistical significance. MHV infection at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell showed significantly decreased gRNA levels and virus titers in TiPARP knockdown cells ( Fig. 3C and D) , indicating a role for TiPARP in facilitating MHV-A59 infection. These differences in gRNA and virus titers persisted even at later time points p.i., when cell viability was decreased, resulting in decreased infectious-virus titers. Furthermore, while IFN-\u24234 and IFN-\u2424 mRNA levels were unaffected by TiPARP deficiency at low or high MOI at 6 or 12 hpi, they were increased at 18 and 22 hpi ( Fig. 3A and C) . Together, our results suggest that TiPARP augments MHV replication throughout infection and negatively regulates IFN-I expression during later stages of infection.",

Because expression of TiPARP is well established to be induced by ligand-activated AhR (43), we hypothesized that MHV-A59 infection resulted in AhR activation. To assess AhR activation during MHV-A59 infection in BMDMs at multiple time points, we quantified the mRNA expression of known effectors downstream of AhR, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, TiPARP, and AhRR ( Fig. 1) . We also analyzed gene expression of AhR itself and of the AhR ligand-producing enzymes IDO1, IDO2, and TDO, as IDO1 gene expression can also be induced by AhR activation. We found that, while CYP1A1, CYP1A2, IDO2, and TDO2 mRNAs were undetectable at all time points, CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, IDO1, and AhR mRNAs were all upregulated over the course of infection (Fig. 4A ). To determine if this response is conserved in other immune cell types, we quantified the transcription of these downstream effectors in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Fig. 4B ). At both 12 and 22 hpi, CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, IDO1, and AhR were all upregulated in BMDCs, suggesting that AhR activation occurs following MHV-A59 infection in multiple cell types.",

To examine whether AhR activation and not an alternative factor facilitated expression of these downstream effectors, we infected cells following chemical inhibition of AhR (Fig. 6A ). We opted for treatment with CH-223191, a well-described chemical inhibitor that prevents ligand binding to AhR ( Fig. 1 ) but does not inhibit other receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (44, 45) . We first confirmed that CH-223191 inhibited chemical AhR activation by agonist TCDD in BMDMs without altering cell viability ( Fig. 6B and C) . During MHV-A59 infection, AhR inhibitor treatment resulted in dose-dependent attenuation of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1. Surprisingly, TiPARP induction was not diminished at any concentration of inhibitor. Furthermore, CH-223191 treatment actually increased AhR mRNA levels slightly at 12 hpi but had no effect on gRNA levels, indicating that the CH-223191-mediated reduction in downstream effector expression was due to inhibition of AhR activation itself rather than decreased AhR expression or increased virus replication.",

TiPARP expression was induced by AhR agonist treatment (Fig. 7A ) but did not change following inhibitor treatment during infection (Fig. 6A) , suggesting MHV could also induce TiPARP expression by an AhR-independent mechanism. Because IFN-I treatment in BMDMs can induce TiPARP expression (8), we next examined whether IFN-I upregulated TiPARP expression after inhibition of AhR activation. Using MHV-infected IF-NAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs treated with CH-223191, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1 (Fig. 8) , confirming that AhR activation did not require IFN signaling. In addition, AhR inhibitor treatment reduced TiPARP induction in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs, indicating that AhR and IFN-I were compensatory in inducing TiPARP during infection. However, CH-223191-mediated reduction of TiPARP mRNA levels in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs was less than that of CYP1B1, AhRR, or IDO1, suggesting that an additional, as yet unknown factor modulated its expression. Finally, gRNA levels in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs trended toward a modest reduction following AhR inhibition (P \u03ed 0.12), possibly reflecting decreases in TiPARP expression. Taken together, our data show that MHV-induced AhR activation is responsible for upregulation of CYP1B1, AhRR, and IDO1 in IFN-replete and -deficient cells and of TiPARP in the absence of IFN-I signaling.",

To determine if IDO1 has a role in AhR activation during MHV-A59 infection, we infected IDO1 \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs with MHV-A59 and quantified effector mRNA levels (Fig. 9B) . Interestingly, levels of CYP1B1, AhRR, TiPARP, AhR, and gRNA were equivalent following infection in WT or IDO1 \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs. As expected, IDO1 mRNA was not detectable in deficient cells. To rule out compensatory effects of other enzymes known to produce kynurenine, we also assessed cells for IDO2 and TDO2 mRNAs but could detect neither in WT or IDO1 \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs. Together, our results suggest that MHV-A59 infection of BMDMs elicits AhR activation through a pathway independent of IDO1.",

While AhR activation has been studied in immune cells following agonist or immunostimulant treatment, its role in the context of virus infection is relatively understudied, and only a few studies have details of host pathways affected by AhR activation. EBV encodes the viral protein EBNA-3, which binds to ARNT and enhances transactivation of downstream effectors by AhR (41) . AhR facilitates HCV infection by inducing expression of CYPs that aid in the formation of lipid droplets required for virus production (38) . As mentioned above, AhR functions in a proviral manner in IAV infection by inducing TiPARP (40) . In contrast, AhR activation in HSV-or HIV-infected macrophages restricts replication by inhibiting expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (39) . Thus, AhR activation during viral infection has differing effects and modulates multiple cellular pathways, many of which remain uncharacterized.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, while AhR is thought to be activated primarily by kynurenine synthesized via IDO1 in inflammatory states and can drive positive-feedback cycles in immune cells (17, 18) , our results demonstrate that MHV infection activates AhR independently of IDO1 ( Fig. 1 and 9 ). We detected gene expression of IDO2 and TDO2 in infected murine liver samples (Fig. 4C) , consistent with the notion that TDO is largely confined to the liver (14) . While TDO or IDO2 could be driving AhR activation by producing kynurenine during in vivo infection, IDO2 and TDO mRNAs were undetectable in IDO1 \u03ea/\u03ea BMDMs. This suggests that kynurenine is produced by a novel IDOI/IDO2/ TDO-independent pathway in BMDMs or that the cells do not utilize kynurenine as the primary AhR ligand during CoV infection. AhR can be activated by several biochemical species, including metabolites of tryptophan or bilirubin or other metabolites of uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways (49) (50) (51) (52) . Other potential initiating pathways include prostaglandin synthesis, cAMP production, and general oxidative stress (20) (21) (22) . Alternatively, during infection, a host or viral protein could directly bind to AhR, enhancing its transactivation activity in a manner similar to that of EBV-encoded EBNA-3, though this may still require concomitant ligand binding (41) . Nonetheless, the levels of the ligand or binding partner activating AhR in BMDMs would likely scale with replication, as downstream effector transcription was correlated with the virus load (Fig.  5) . Additional investigation will be necessary to detail the exact mechanism of this IDO-independent AhR activation pathway. Furthermore, while IDO1 does not regulate AhR activation during MHV infection in BMDMs, it could still be modulating other cellular pathways as part of the host response. For instance, IDO1 has been shown to regulate immune cell function by mediating tryptophan starvation, resulting in activation of mTOR, a mediator of several metabolic and immune pathways (53, 54) .",

Specifically, AhR negatively regulated TNF-\u2423 and positively regulated IL-1\u2424 and IL-10, cytokines that are also upregulated in the brains of MHV-infected mice (2) . These changes were not due to alterations in viral replication, as the viral load was unchanged by AhR activation or inhibition. The mechanism driving cytokine changes during MHV infection is likely complex but probably involves interaction of activated AhR with NF-B (30, (33) (34) (35) 55) (Fig. 1) . The effects of these cytokine expression changes will need to be investigated in vivo to determine their roles in pathogenesis, because their functions are protean: some of these cytokines are additionally posttranscriptionally regulated, and activating ligands may differ in cultured BMDMs versus infected mice. Thus, it is difficult to conclude at present that AhR drives a strictly pro-or anti-inflammatory phenotype. Rather, AhR activation may serve to fine tune the innate immune response to MHV infection.",

To determine whether AhR activation during CoV infection modulates cytokine expression, we infected CH-223191-treated BMDMs with MHV-A59 and quantified levels of IFN-\u24234, IFN-\u2424, and IFN-\u2425 mRNAs and of cytokines previously shown to be regulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AhR activation in macrophages (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u2423], IL-1\u2424, and IL-10) (29, 30) (Fig. 10A). Inhibition of AhR had no impact on expression of IFN-\u24234/IFN-\u2424/IFN-\u2425 mRNAs. On the other hand, CH-223191 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of TNF-\u2423 mRNA and a concurrent decrease in the levels of IL-1\u2424 and IL-10 mRNAs.
