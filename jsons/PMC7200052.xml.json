Moreover, evidences show that in bats there is a continuous circulation of additional SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses able to replicate efficiently in primary human lung cells [5]. It is therefore predictable that new epidemics/pandemics due to zoonotic coronaviruses will emerge in humans in the future. Consequently, together with a preventive vaccine, effective antivirals are needed to be developed within a broader program of Global preparedness.",

Moreover, active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract is observed in patients also after the peak of respiratory symptoms, which may result in prolonged viral spreading of the infection [8]. Therefore, reducing the viral titer represents a major goal in order to slow/block the disease progression as well as to significantly limit the viral shedding. The latter objective would result in the lowering of R0 from 2.5 (2.5 people infected by a positive subject) to a value < 1 (less than one person infected by a positive subject). In this way the spread of the virus would be drastically contained and lastly blocked. Finally, the reduced viral replication would give the opportunity to the adaptive humoral immune system (with the production of antibodies, hopefully neutralizing) enough time to mount a sufficient primary response capable of containing further viral replication and eradicating the infection.",

Similarly to all RNA viruses, the viral genome replication and transcription processes of SARS-CoV-2 depend on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is encoded by the RNA virus to catalyze the RNA synthesis from RNA templates. Consequently, RdRp is the key enzyme in the viral biological cycle of all RNA viruses, regardless the polarity of the viral RNA genome [9, 10]. Although different for each RNA viruses, all viral RdRps are characterized by a 500\u2013600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven catalytic motifs are located in the RdRp palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRp and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Nevertheless, RdRps from positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses show differences with significant implications in the enzymatic mode of action [11]. In particular, the palm catalytic subdomain (Motif C) is the most conserved region of all monomeric viral RNA polymerases with two aspartic acid residues that coordinate the two metal ions necessary for the phosphoryl transfer reaction [12, 13]. However, while positive-sense RNA viruses show a glycine preceding the two aspartates, negative-sense RNA viruses show a serine, resulting in the alternative interactions with the metal ions [14]. Mutation of the first aspartic residue results in a complete loss of RNA polymerase activity, whereas mutations of the second aspartate diminish the polymerase activity or modify the metal cofactor requirements, but do not inactivate the enzyme [15, 16]. Negative-sense RNA viruses, have an asparagine instead of the second aspartic acid in Motif C which has been shown to enable viral RNA polymerases to use manganese (Mn2+) instead of magnesium (Mg2+) as cofactor [17].",

NHC EIDD-1931 has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in a pre-clinical animal model [22]. However, all three of them have been developed for negative-sense RNA viruses which show a significant difference in the RdRp sequence and structure compared to the positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus. In this respect, Sofosbuvir could represent the optimal nucleoside analog to be repositioned to treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, it has been developed for the positive-sense HCV RNA virus which shares high sequence and structural homology with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Sofosbuvir has been already shown to be effective for other positive-sense RNA viruses, namely Yellow Fever and Hepatitis A virus [23, 24].",

            "text": "In conclusion, as for all RNA viruses, the RdRp of the newly identified positive-sense human SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus represents the most optimal target for an antiviral drug. Linear amino acid sequence as well as molecule structure show the highest homology to RdRps of other positive-sense RNA viruses. Therefore, it is highly predictable that an antiviral developed for an RNA virus with a genome of the same polarity (i.e. Sofosbuvir for HCV) could have a higher inhibitory efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2, compared to those developed for negative-sense RNA viruses. Overall, the possibility of repositioning already available drugs will significantly accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses.",
