First, the small number of cases limits our ability to detect discriminant factors on presentation. Second, the retrospective nature of the study may also limit the power of the study to identify clinical predictors. Third, the inclusion of patients from the Al-Hasa outbreak may have contributed to the absence of significance of predictors of MERS-CoV and may explain why there were high proportions of ESRD and diabetic patients among our cases. One of the strengths of our study is ascertainment of cases and controls through the master list that included all cases admitted to rule out MERS-CoV infection during the study period. In conclusion, the results suggest that few clinical predictors could enhance the ability to predict which patients with CAP would have MERS-CoV. However, further prospective analysis and matched case-control studies may shed light on the possible predictors of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Zaki", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Van Boheemen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Bestebroer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Osterhaus", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Fouchier", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "367", "issn": "", "pages": "1814--1834", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "epidemiological findings from a retrospective investigation", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Hijawi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Abdallat", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Sayaydeh", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Novel coronavirus infections in Jordan", "volume": "19", "issn": "1", "pages": "12--20", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
