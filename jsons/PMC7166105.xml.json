This disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is believed to have emerged from a live animal market in Wuhan, China, and was transmitted to humans through close contact; although, there are competing theories on the viral origin. The virus is part of a larger family of viruses called coronaviruses that are single-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses [4]. Coronaviruses are not new and classically have caused mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms in humans [5]. If the name SARS sounds familiar, it is because there have been two strains related to outbreaks this century to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",

Patients can help by avoiding contact with people who are ill. This has led many health care facilities (eg, hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities) to ban all visitors. Stress can ensue when friends and family members are hospitalized, but it is important to follow these guidelines. Many states and locales have instituted social distancing policies with the goal of decreasing viral transmission; therefore, it is important for the public to follow current regulations to avoid congregating and gathering in groups.",

Antiviral medications exist, and clinical trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy of these medications. Treatment at this time is mostly supportive with isolation and oxygen therapy when needed. Patients who have difficulty breathing may require intubation and treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. At this point, a vaccine is not available for the general public, but clinical trials of various vaccines are currently underway, which is a top priority to prevent future epidemics.",

However, the risks of being infected with COVID-19 in the perioperative setting must be discussed with the patient, as emerging data suggest a worse clinical outcome if this occurs in the postoperative setting. Furthermore, disposition to a higher risk facility such as a nursing home or rehabilitation facility may place patients in an unsafe environment.

By allowing these medical providers to work in other sectors of health care or simply stay home and promote social distancing, we are fighting this disease as a global team.
