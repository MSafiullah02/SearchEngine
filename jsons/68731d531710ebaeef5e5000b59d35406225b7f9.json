            "text": "The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a metaanalysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high-versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 -0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 -0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 -0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.",

Many clinical staff have been moved into new roles and may be managing acutely unwell patients using unfamiliar equipment. Stresses caused by high patient mortality rates, staffing shortages, concerns about infecting self or family members, and changing guidance on personal protective equipment can add to work pressure. This has raised concerns about the potential impact on the mental health of epidemic and pandemic responders Greenberg et al., 2020) .",

We defined high and low exposure as direct contact with infected patients, or work in wards where direct contact was considered highly likely (e.g. critical care, designated treatment wards, emergency departments) compared to clinicians working without direct contact or work in hospital areas where direct contact was unlikely.

Both of these comparisons suggest that the impact of epidemic and pandemic response work on mental health is small, but in the case of meta-analytic assessment, statistically detectable. However, this is in addition to already high levels of poor mental health that are common in acute medical staff. A narrative review of potential risk factors for poor mental health in epidemic and pandemic response identified being a nurse, experiencing stigma from others, seeing colleagues infected, and being personally quarantined as predictors of worse outcomes. Protective factors included social and occupational support, effectiveness and faith in infection control measures, a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Formal psychological support services were identified as a valuable form of support.",

            "text": "The results of this review and meta-analysis raise several issues with regard to provide ongoing and long-term support for clinical staff responding to such health emergencies. One is the extent to which epidemic and pandemic response is uniquely 'traumatising' and might lead to high levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, thereby implying that a trauma-focus for staff support should be the dominant approach to addressing outcomes of poor mental health. With regard to the published studies, although there are seemingly high rates of staff who score above cut-off on measures of PTSD symptoms, some significant caveats need to be born in mind. As can be seen from Table 3 , cut-off values used for defining a positive 'case' varied considerably even between studies using the same measure. The most widely used scale in these studies is the Impact of Events Scale-Revised for which a cut-off of 33-34 has been found to be the most predictive of diagnosable PTSD (Creamer et al., 2003; Morina et al., 2013 ) and yet most studies use a cut-off of considerably less. This suggests that an important proportion of those reported under the prevalence figures are likely to have transitory, sub-syndromal PTSD symptoms, or non-specific distress, that may be a risk for PTSD but are unlikely to reach the level of a diagnosable case. Indeed, the prevalences reported here are comparable to prevalences found in clinical staff more widely. For example, the reported prevalence of >33 scoring on the IES-R is 15% in acute medical staff , 16% in surgical trainees , and 17% in cancer physicians (McFarland and Roth, 2017) . Studies included in this review using similar IES-R cut-offs tended to report lower prevalence rates with only one study reporting higher.",

Finally, symptoms were almost exclusively measured by self-report measures which are known to inflate the rate of true cases (Bonanno et al., 2010) . Indeed, high rates on self-report measures but low rates on structured interview assessments have been found in SARS responders (Lancee et al., 2008) .",
