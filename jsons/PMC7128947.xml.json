Diarrheal diseases are also of public health importance in developed countries and are associated with considerable morbidity and a substantial number of hospitalizations among children and the elderly. Acute diarrhea can be caused by many different agents including parasites, bacteria and viruses; the latter of which have been given significant attention in recent years. This review is devoted to Rotavirus-induced enteric infection, and in particular, to the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to underlie the intestinal fluid secretion caused by the virus.",

Six of the proteins are found in the virus particle (vp1, vp2, vp3, vp4, vp6 and vp7), whereas the remaining five proteins are non-structural (NDP1\u2013NSP5). Rotavirus is classified into serogroups A\u2013E based on antigenic properties. Only groups A\u2013C have been shown to infect humans and most human Rotavirus disease is caused by group A Rotavirus. The group A Rotavirus are further classified into G (serotypes) and P types based on identification of antigens on the outer capsid proteins. Of the 14 serotypes (G-types) that have been identified in various species, nine have been recognized in humans, and of these, four serotypes (1\u20134) are dominant globally.",

Current information indicates that Rotavirus attachment and entry into cells constitute a multistep process. Recent models suggest that rotaviruses interact first with a sialic acid receptor and then with a sialic acid-independent receptor \u301a9\u301b. It has been proposed that the receptors might be part of lipid microdomains \u301a10\u301b and recognize integrins \u301a11\u301b. In view of this and other information, two opposing hypotheses have been proposed as to how Rotavirus enters the target cell: through direct entry or fusion \u301a12\u301b and through Ca2+-dependent endocytosis \u301a13\u301b. The Ca2+-dependent endocytosis process represents the most attractive mode of entry and is based on the fact that infectious Rotavirus is endocytosed into the cytoplasm with a very low Ca2+ concentration that leads to a Ca2+ afflux from the vesicles to the cytoplasm. Once the endosome Ca2+ concentration equilibrates with the cytoplasm, below the critical level for stability of the outer capsid, the virus loses its outer proteins and then lyses with the vesicle membrane, permitting the virus to escape to the cytoplasm \u301a14\u301b.",

            "text": "A symptomatic infection with Rotavirus stimulates a strong humoral IgG immune response which lasts for the lifetime. While the IgG responses are easily recorded, it is generally thought that protection from Rotavirus disease is mediated by local IgA antibodies. Several studies have shown that local IgA is important or at least a good predictor of protection \u301a15\u301b. Two proteins on Rotavirus, vp4 and vp7, are thought to play a critical role in mounting a protective immune response. Both proteins are constituents of the outer capsid and have been found, independently of each other, to stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies. Children infected with a particular serotype of Rotavirus are more likely to be protected against challenge with the same serotype than against re-infection with a different serotype. However, heterotypic protection is operating, as has been found in several studies. There are several possible explanations for this. One is that local IgA antibodies recognize cross-reacting epitopes on vp4 and vp7, another is that antibodies to the inner capsid protein vp6 can modulate protection, and a third possibility is that cross-reacting virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) participate in protection. The role of CTLs in Rotavirus infections is, however, not yet established.",

Neonatal infections appear to be nosocomial in origin, because they are rarely seen in babies born at home or at village health centers. Serological surveys imply that most children have experienced a Rotavirus infection by 24 months of age. Contrasting with the capacity of Rotavirus to cause infection at any age, the clinical consequences of infection appear to be strongly influenced by age. For example most neonatal infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild symptoms. The relative resistance to clinical symptoms that is observed in older children and adults is not likely to be due to age-altered physiological status, as in certain small animals, but more likely due to active immunity, reinforced by repeated infections throughout life.

Strains causing less illness were characterized by milder histological changes \u301a18\u301b. These histological changes are not limited to calves with symptomatic response; in fact asymptomatically infected calves show villus blunting too \u301a19\u301b. In pigs, the macroscopic changes include thinning of the intestinal wall, and microscopic changes include villus atrophy, villus blunting and conversion to a cuboidal epithelium. As with bovine Rotavirus, porcine rotaviruses have been shown to differ somewhat in their ability to cause histologic lesions \u301a20\u301b. The SDSV strain of porcine Rotavirus causes more severe villus atrophy than the OSU strain, but the two strains produce similar clinical symptoms. Finally, rabbits infected experimentally with Rotavirus show normal histology in the face of marked changes in glucose and leucine uptake \u301a21\u301b.

The pathology of murine Rotavirus is generally similar to that of lambs, pigs and calves, but differs in certain aspects. Within 24 h after infection with murine Rotavirus, mouse intestinal enterocytes appear swollen and vacuolated. Infection and histologic changes are concentrated to the upper small intestine. Vacuolation of enterocytes is most prominent on the villus tip, but can occur in enterocytes throughout the villus. The vacuolation is more extensive in mice than in other species. Unlike other species, the villus blunting is limited and very transient in mice, despite clinical signs of diarrhea. The lack of extensive pathologic changes found in the mouse intestine and the observation that many enterocytes appear vacuolated but do not show evidence of replication led Osborne and coworkers \u301a22\u301b to propose that in mice, fluid loss in diarrhea is secondary to a local villus ischemia, as discussed in more detail below.",

When no glucose was present in the intestinal lumen of newborn pigs, a net secretion of water and sodium ions was observed in control animals.

In contrast to the pig experiments summarized above, a net fluid and sodium uptake was observed in the control rats when perfusing the intestinal lumen with an isotonic electrolyte solution devoid of glucose. Net fluid secretion and a significantly decreased net sodium uptake peaked 24 h after virus inoculation. Concomitantly, villus height had decreased to one-third of control, whereas crypt depth was unaltered. Similarly, Starkey et al. \u301a28\u301b investigated epithelial transport of murine intestines in vitro at different times after inoculation with Rotavirus. The intestinal segments were perfused with an isotonic electrolyte solution containing mannitol in an organ bath. A significant secretion of fluid, sodium and chloride ions was only seen at 72 h postinoculation, a time at which the clinical signs of diarrhea in awake mice was most pronounced \u301a29\u301b. In line with this, Lundgren et al. \u301a30\u301b showed with a similar technique that 48\u201360 h after infecting newborn mice with Rotavirus a net fluid secretion was observed and indirect evidence was also obtained for an increased electrolyte secretion.",

In Ussing chamber experiments the increases in PD and SCC upon adding glucose to the mucosal incubation medium were significantly smaller in the infected intestinal segments \u301a32\u301b. Unidirectional measurements of sodium fluxes indicated that this difference in response was mainly explained by a blunted glucose effect on the lumen-to-tissue flux of sodium \u301a32\u301b. In line with this, the glucose effect on intestinal net sodium and water flux, measured in infected piglets in vivo, was absent or considerably smaller than that seen in normal intestines \u301a26\u301b. The influence of the virus infection on glucose transport has also been investigated using the more sophisticated technique of brush border membrane vesicles.

In agreement with this, Halaihel et al. \u301a38\u301b showed that the Na-D-glucose symport (SGLT1) was strongly inhibited by Rotavirus.

Most studies suggest that one mechanism that at least in part may explain the virus-induced attenuation of electrolyte and fluid absorption is an inhibition of the symports for sodium and glucose/amino acids. A lowered activity of the brush border enzymes probably also contributes to a diminished absorptive capacity. Finally, the presence of blunted villi, decreasing the surface area for fluid and solute uptake, may be of importance.",

In this context it should be pointed out that Hamilton\u02c8s studies were performed on neonatal pigs using Coronavirus, which may not mimic Rotavirus in all its effects, as pointed out earlier when discussing epithelial permeability. As support for their hypothesis Hamilton and collaborators reported cell biological changes that indicated that the villus cells were more crypt-like in infected intestines. Thus, Hamilton et al. explain the lowered glucose uptake (see above) in infected intestines as an indication of an increased number of crypt-like cells in the intestinal mucosa \u301a39\u301b. Furthermore, as reviewed earlier, enzymatic activity measured in mucosal scrapings of control and virus-infected intestines differs markedly. Whereas mucosal sucrase, lactase and Na, K ATPase activity were found to be higher in controls than in infected intestines, the opposite was true for thymidine kinase \u301a24\u301b, \u301a31\u301b, \u301a34\u301b, \u301a35\u301b, \u301a39\u301b, \u301a40\u301b. Again, the lowered disaccharidase activity is taken as evidence for the enterocytes being crypt-like. The increased thymidine kinase activity may explain the findings reported by Shepherd et al. \u301a40\u301b that the migration of 3H-thymidine-labelled epithelial cells along the crypt-villus axis was faster during the acute phase of virus diarrhea than in control animals. Finally, in the Coronavirus-infected intestines, the inhibitory effect of theophylline on mucosa-to-serosa flux of sodium ions could not be demonstrated. All these observations were taken to indicate that the enterocytes of infected animals exhibit the functional characteristics of crypt cells.",

In line with this cholera toxin induced secretion was accompanied by an augmented release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, a neurotransmitter, into the venous effluent from feline intestinal segments. Taken together these observations strongly suggested that ENS in some way was activated by cholera toxin. This conclusion was further substantiated by Kirchgessener et al. \u301a78\u301b, who monitored the activation of ENS neurons with a histochemical method using an antibody to the fos oncogene product, the expression of which has been shown to be a marker of nervous activity. Exposing the intestinal mucosa to cholera toxin activated neurons in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses.

In Ussing chamber experiments it was demonstrated that tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and mecamylamide (a nicotinic receptor blocker more lipophilic than hexamethonium) in a dose-dependent way attenuated the increased PD observed in intestines exposed to virus. Similarly, in experiments in which the lumen of intact intestinal segments were perfused in an organ bath, tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and hexamethonium significantly lowered the monitored PD and often turned fluid secretion into fluid absorption in virus-infected intestines. Finally, giving lidocaine repeatedly intraperitoneally to awake mice inoculated with Rotavirus significantly prevented the fecal losses of fluid.

The experimental evidence for a decreased rate of absorption of electrolytes and glucose/amino acids is convincing and may reflect both an attenuated absorptive area (possibly more pronounced in Coronavirus than in Rotavirus infection) and a decreased transport capacity of epithelial cell symports. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity in the brush border region is markedly decreased, indirectly lowering the rate of transport of the symports for glucose and amino acids. It is more difficult to evaluate the importance of the Rotavirus-evoked increase in tissue conductance (most likely reflecting an augmented paracellular permeability) for the transport of fluid and electrolytes. The conductance increase may partly dissipate the hyperosmolar compartment in the upper parts of villi, lowering the osmotic forces moving water across the epithelial layer.",

            "text": "Figure 1: A speculative hypothesis for Rotavirus-induced diarrhea. Panel A. Cellular events leading to diarrhea. Rotavirus and/or its enterotoxin NSP4 inhibits fluid and electrolyte transport of the villus epithelium by attenuating the Na-glucose symport SGLT1 and possibly also Na-amino acid symports (not shown). Concomitantly, disaccharidase activity is inhibited. It is possible that the Na, K pump in the basolateral membrane is also attenuated, although quantitatively this effect is much less pronounced than for the disaccharidases. Taken together, these events will lower the rates of fluid, electrolyte and glucose absorption. The paracellular epithelial permeability is increased by Rotavirus and NSP4. The importance of this effect for epithelial transport is difficult to judge. Intracellular calcium concentration is increased in the intestinal epithelium in response to virus/NSP4. This may evoke the release of amines/peptides from intestinal endocrine cells (middle cell). Furthermore, cytokines, prostaglandins and NO are known to be released from the enterocytes in response to microorganisms. All these biologically active compounds may, alone or together, activate neuronal dendrites located just underneath the intestinal epithelium and hence stimulate secretory reflexes in the ENS. For a more detailed account of the intracellular mechanisms leading to an increased calcium concentration, the reader is referred to reference \u301a14\u301b. Panel B. Integrative events leading to diarrhea. NSP4 may diffuse into the crypts to directly influence the intestinal secretory epithelium, possibly via the NSP4 effect on intracellular calcium. Furthermore, Rotavirus and/or NSP4 may activate secretory reflexes in the ENS in the way depicted in panel A. Inflammatory mediators, if present, may also stimulate nervous reflexes. The nervous reflex shown in the figure represents the simplest model that can be constructed from the observations made with cholera toxin. No pharmacological analysis has been made of the nervous reflex activated by Rotavirus. Minus sign indicates an attenuation; plus sign an increase. Shaded cells in panel B depict endocrine cells.",
