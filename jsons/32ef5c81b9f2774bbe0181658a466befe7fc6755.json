Because the viruses are expelled mainly attached to small liquid droplets, with diverse sizes and weights, and the external environmental conditions can also be diverse, the subsequent motion spanes different spatial and temporal scales. We analize the validity of two simple models in this context. For droplet sizes larger than 100 \u00b5m, computing the time of decay to the ground and the distance travelled within a simple free fall model with empirical data extracted from the literature, we obtain distances in the range between 1 to 3 meters from the emitter, with a falling time of less than 1 s, similar to known recommendations for safe social distancing. For droplet sizes less than 100 \u00b5m a model of motion in a viscous medium predicts that isolated viruses could remain suspended in quiet air for more than a month, while small droplets of 1 \u00b5m in size can remain suspended for several hours, in qualitative agreement with experimental results on virus stability in aerosols.",

The initial advise from the World Health Organization was that only confirmed infected people should wear masks, in order to prevent transmission of the virus by sneezing and coughing [1] . But the high rate of propagation of the virus in different environments around the world raised a concern about this initial prescription. In particular, the fact that most of infected people go without developing symptoms make them potential transmitters of the desease. Together with restrictions on human circulation and social distancing, other important protective measure can be the generalized use of masks in public places, like hospitals, supermarkets and aircrafts [2] .",

It was found that droplets of sizes less than \u223c 30 \u00b5m can remain suspended in the air of the room after exiting the main current. Another way of exhaling the viruses in the air is when speaking and breathing. These are softer processes as compared with a cough or a sneeze, but they are equally potential ways of spreading the virus in the surroundings of an infected person. From these observations, it is clear that the answers to the above posed questions are not unique. Many factors influence the spatial and temporal extensions of the virus in the air.",

First, we will consider a virus that is ejected from the mouth as a free falling object under the only influence of gravity. We will analise the validity of this approximation with the size and weight of the particle. When valid, the results for this model predict that the virus should settle down on the ground after travelling approximately 1 to 3 meters, as suggested by different sources and transmitted in the general media [7] . Then, we will present some estimates of the air interparticle distance as compared with the size of the Covid-19 virus and of larger droplets. This will suggest us that the virus falls down in a viscous medium, the air. We will address the problem of the identification of the correct form of the drag force on the droplets, which has been considered many times in related contexts, see e.g. references [8, 9] for excellent discussions (see also [10, 11] for elegant analytical solutions to the equations of motion). Because expelled droplets, where the virus can be found, show a distribution of sizes and masses, we will present simple estimations of the rate and time of decay for typical sizes of the particles. We will not consider the initial turbulent flow nor external currents produced by air conditioning, for example [3, 5] . Instead, we will focus on the late regime of deposition of the small droplets that remain suspended in quiet air in equilibrium. The results can be considered as bringing lower bounds, or conservative estimations, to the spatial and temporal extensions of airborne virus. The analysis leads us to conclude that typical droplets containing virus may remain suspended in quiet air for more than an hour, in agreement with experimental results reported recently [6] .",

The maximal initial velocity of a particle when talking or breathing was reported to be v 1 \u2248 1.5 m/s, while the maximal initial velocity when sneezing or caughing was found to be v 2 \u2248 5.0 m/s.

Droplet sizes are strongly dependent on the nature of the phenomenon, while talking, breathing, sneezing or caughing. For example, it has been found that sneezing produces larger droplets than coughing, and also that the velocity at which the droplets are expelled is considerably larger during sneezing. Other characteristics that may influence the final results reported in the literature are measurement techniques, the number of sampled indiviuals and their health conditions, among others. Last but not least, it is also known that droplets suffer evaporation after coming out of the respiratory tract. Then, the methodology of measurment is also important. The further from the mouth, the smaller will be the droplet size, due to evaporation.

For droplets larger than \u2248 200 \u00b5m, typical of sneezing events, a free fall model is appropriate. They can attain distances of several meters, justifying recommendations for social distancing. On the other side, for droplets of sizes less than \u2248 200 \u00b5m, the free fall model is not accurate, and a model of motion in viscous air is necessary. Our results show that typical respiratory droplets with sizes \u2264 10 \u00b5m can remain suspended in dry quiet air from several minutes to hours. The time of evaporation of water droplets of sizes as small as 10 \u00b5m is much less than a second [25] , leaving droplets nuclei. Then, we conclude that droplet nuclei, which can be suspended in dry air for hours, may be carriers of the virus in quiet air environments, like in a closed room or in an aircraft.",

Note the double logarithmic scale. A(h) depends on the height from which the droplet is emitted (see text). Vertical solid lines correspond the examples computed in the text. times of decay from a height h = 1.7 m for both cases are: v dn \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m/s, t dn \u2248 5.9 \u00d7 10 4 s \u2248 16.3 h for droplets nuclei, v d \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 m/s, t d \u2248 5.9 \u00d7 10 2 s \u2248 9.8 mins for water droplets. (11) These order of magnitude estimates show that droplets nuclei of \u223c 1 \u00b5m can remain suspended in air for around 16 hours, while droplets of \u223c 10 \u00b5m can remain for around 10 minutes. These results are compatible with recent experimental determinations of the halflife of the Covid-19 virus in aerosols",

More experimental studies are needed in order to confirm if airborne transmission is relevant as compared with other known mechanisms, like surface mediated ones. Finally, it is important to stress that the results presented here, based on simplified models of motion, represent lower bounds for the time of stability of small droplets in the air. Considering realistic situations, taking into account small currents and/or convection mechanisms in closed spaces do not contradict the present conclusions [4, 5, 28]. Inclusion of these and other effects, like the process of evaporation of droplets, are interesting routes for future research.
