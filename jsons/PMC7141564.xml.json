Because of the low fidelity of RNA polymerases, viral RNA genomes comprise a collection of RNA species (quasispecies) with random mutations. Therefore, in RNA viruses the generation and selection of variants with different antigenic properties that can evade recognition by neutralizing antibodies is common. Genetic variability can also generate variant peptide sequences that are either new antigens or that do not bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at all.",

Viruses encode homologs of complement regulatory proteins that are secreted and block complement activation and neutralization of virus particles (Table 1;\nBox 1\n). The cowpox virus (CPV) complement inhibitor, termed inflammation modulatory protein (IMP), blocks immunopathological tissue damage at the site of infection, presumably by inhibiting production of the macrophage chemoattractant factors C3a and C5a (Ref. 3). Viruses protect the membranes of infected cells and the lipid envelopes of virus particles from complement lysis by encoding homologs of inhibitors of the membrane-attack complex. Viruses such as HIV, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and vaccinia virus (VV) utilize a clever strategy, \u2018borrowing\u2019 host cellular factors, including CD59, which normally protects cells from complement lysis, and incorporating them into the viral envelope.AlcamiAntonioKoszinowskiUlrich H.Box 1Box 1.

The key role of both type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type II (\u03b3) IFNs as one of the first anti-viral defense mechanisms is highlighted by the fact that anti-IFN strategies are present in most viruses5, 6, 7 (Table 2\n). Viruses block IFN-induced transcriptional responses and the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signal transduction pathways, and also inhibit the activation of IFN effector pathways that induce an anti-viral state in the cell and limit virus replication. This is mainly achieved by inhibiting double-stranded (ds)-RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation, the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1) and the RNase L system, which might degrade viral RNA and arrest translation in the host cell.",

The VV-secreted IFN \u03b1/\u03b2R is also localized at the cell surface to protect cells from IFN (Table 3\n). Additionally, several viruses inhibit the activity of IFN-\u03b3, a key activator of cellular immunity, by blocking the synthesis or activity of factors required for its production, such as interleukin (IL)-18 or IL-12 (Table 4\n): CPV cytokine response modifier (Crm A) inhibits caspase-1, which processes the mature forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (2, 6); various poxviruses encode soluble IL-18-binding proteins (IL-18BPs)8, 9, 10; measles virus (MeV) binds CD46 in macrophages and inhibits IL-12 production1; and herpesviruses and poxviruses express IL-10 homologs that diminish the Th1 response by downregulating the production of IL-12 (1, 11, 12).",

These proteins were originally identified as homologs of host TNFRs, IL-1Rs and IFN-\u03b3Rs. The discovery of four distinct soluble poxvirus TNFRs, and a membrane TNF-binding activity in VV infections, is remarkable and suggests that viral TNFRs might have additional functions18, 19, 20 (M. Saraiva and A. Alcami, unpublished). Binding and activity assays have identified secreted proteins that bind IFN-\u03b1 and-\u03b2, chemokines (CKs) or granuloctye\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2, and that have no sequence similarity to cellular counterparts6, 18, 21. In poxviruses, three distinct secreted IL-18BPs that have recently been identified are homologs of human and mouse secreted IL-18BPs but not of membrane IL-18Rs8, 9, 10. Inactivation of poxvirus cytokine receptor genes results in virus attenuation in vivo but, interestingly, deletion of the VV IL-1\u03b2R enhances virus virulence and the onset of fever, suggesting that the purpose of some immune-evasion mechanisms is to reduce the immunopathology caused by viral infection18.",

Virus-encoded CKs are either antagonists that block leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection, or agonists that could enhance the recruitment of cells that support viral replication or prevent Th1 anti-viral responses. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) chemokine 1 (MCK-1) activates monocytes in vitro and increases monocyte-associated viremia in vivo\n23. HIV Tat is partially homologous to CKs and is a potent monocyte chemoattractant24. Herpesviruses encode many CK receptors (vCKRs) but their function is not clear. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated virus [human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)] open reading frame (ORF) 74 is constitutively activated and induces cell proliferation, which might favor virus replication. vCKRs encoded by HCMV and HHV-6 reduce the amount of the factor regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in tissue culture and/or its transcription and might inhibit CK activity locally16, 25. A role for vCKRs in vivo has been shown for MCMV. vCKs and vCKRs might contribute directly to pathology. The angiogenic properties of HHV-8 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (vMIP-1) could account for the increased vascularization found in HHV-8-associated tumors, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US28 mediates vascular smooth muscle cell migration and perhaps vascular disease26, and expression of HHV-8 ORF74 in transgenic mice results in Kaposi\u2019s-sarcoma-like lesions27.",

Cellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome, the complex major intracellular protease, and the resulting peptides are translocated by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they contribute to the assembly of MHC class I molecules1, 11, 32, 33, 34. MHC class I molecules indicate the composition of cellular proteins to cells of the immune system. The presentation of foreign peptides activates and attracts cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Interference with antigen processing [e.g. Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen A1 (EBNA1)] or TAP function [e.g. herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cell protein 47 (ICP47) and HCMV US6 and pp65] prevents peptide generation and transport either specifically or generally (Table 6\n). Viruses use various mechanisms to modify the maturation, assembly and export of MHC class I molecules. To date, no cellular homologs have been found for the proteins and functions that target peptide processing, transport and MHC maturation. With few exceptions35, the viral proteins bind their target molecule directly. There is only limited functional homology and no sequence homology among the different viral effectors. Nevertheless, the general outcome of these functions is the same: downregulation of MHC class I molecules or of some MHC class I alleles. The study of MHC class I regulation has revealed additional genes in herpesviruses of different species36, 37, 38, which might affect many cell types or only those tissues relevant for virus maintenance.",

NK cells, the first line of cellular defence against viruses, have receptors for certain MHC molecules. Some of these receptors silence the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and act as killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR). Other receptors, designated leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIR), are expressed mainly on monocytes and B cells. Engagement of an NK receptor can alternatively result in NK activation as not all receptors have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their intracellular domains. The HCMV protein UL18 and the MCMV m144 protein, which are homologous to MHC class I, could be associated with NK killing, and UL18 is instrumental in the identification of LIR-1. In addition, the HCMV UL40 protein provides a peptide selectively required for the maturation of the HLA-E molecule, an NK target39, 40. However, clinical isolates of HCMV confer a much stronger NK resistance than the laboratory strains sequenced and tested so far, and this resistance is unrelated to MHC class I expression and LIR-1 (Ref. 41). Clinical isolates carry additional genes, and in vitro propagation has probably led to a loss of certain NK-specific gene functions.",

At the post-translational level, the HCMV US2 protein, which affects MHC class I, apparently also translocates the DR\u03b1 and the DM\u03b1 chain into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. Another target involved in interference with MHC class II function is the shuttling between endosomal peptide loading and surface expression. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and HIV Nef affect vesicle traffic as well as the function of the endocytic machinery. Accordingly, in addition to MHC class II, other proteins that use this pathway, for example the CD4 molecule, are also affected.",

Moreover, why is there such complexity and functional redundancy? Is there a hierarchy in terms of general importance or do some functions operate only in certain tissues? Is complexity and redundancy a viral strategy that enables viruses to infect individuals resistant to some functions? Are the functions of an individual viral gene modulated by its genetic context, and is there any evidence for cooperativity?
