Multiple hurdles exist to clinical xenotransplantation, including immunologic barriers, metabolic differences between pigs -the source species most commonly considered -and humans, and ethical concerns. Since clinical trials were first proposed almost 10 years ago, the degree of risk for infection transmitted from the xenograft donor to the recipient has been extensively investigated. A number of potential viral pathogens have been identified including porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV). Sensitive diagnostic assays have been developed for each virus. Human-tropic PERV are exogenous recombinants between PERV-A and PERV-C sequences and are present in only a subset of swine. Porcine cytomegalovirus can be excluded from herds of source animals by early weaning of piglets. In contrast, the risks associated with PLHV remain undefined. Microbiologic studies and assays for potential xenogeneic pathogens have furthered understanding of risks associated with xenotransplantation. Thus far, clinical xenotransplantation of pig tissues has not resulted in transmission of viral infection to humans; significant risks for disease transmission from swine to humans have not been confirmed. If immunologic hurdles can be overcome, it is reasonable to initiate carefully monitored clinical trials.",

Others who might benefit from organ transplantation are either not yet 'sick enough' to be placed on official waiting lists, or suffer from diseases (diabetes, cirrhosis) that might be treated with organ, islet or cellular transplants if the supply of tissues were increased dramatically. In 1907 Alexis Carrel suggested that the future of transplantation for the treatment of organ failure was 'heterotransplantation'. This transplantation of cells, tissues, or vascularized organs from nonhuman species into humans, now termed xenotransplantation, would have the theoretical advantage of providing an unlimited supply of transplantable organs as either permanent organ replacements or as 'bridges' to the availability of human-derived organs (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In addition, these organs might be resistant to infection by common human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus or HIV.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, multiple barriers currently exist to the broad application of xenotransplantation, including immunologically mediated graft rejection of xenogeneic tissues, possible metabolic or molecular incompatibilities between donor organs and humans, ethical concerns, and the risk of infections that might be transmitted from the donor species to the human recipient and to the general human population. The likelihood of clinical success of xenotransplantation was initially enhanced by the development of genetically modified swine which express human complement regulatory proteins. More recently, pigs have been produced that have disrupted genes for the enzyme alpha-1,3galactosyltransferase; these swine are unable to express a\u22121,3-gal (Gal) sugars on their cells, which is the major endothelial antigen targeted by hyperacute, humoral graft rejection. The combination of immune suppression, use of organs across histocompatability barriers, and the absence of pre-existing immunity in the recipient to animalderived organisms, render the host more susceptible to infection. Consequently, infection is likely to remain a significant barrier to xenotransplantation even as immune barriers are breached. Indeed, public attention regarding xenotransplantation has focused less on these immunologic hurdles than on the on the possible spread of infection from nonhuman species to human xenograft recipients and into the community at large (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . This theoretical risk merits reconsideration in light of data assembled over the past 10 years regarding the degree of infectious risk posed by xenotransplantation.",

Hyperacute graft rejection (HAR) is the effect of preformed ('natural') antibodies present in humans and other Old World primates against a ubiquitous Gal epitope expressed on (porcine) vascular endothelial cells (2, 4, 5, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . With HAR, the binding of antibody with complement deposition results in the rapid death of vascularized xenografts. Strategies to prevent hyperacute rejection have included depletion of anti-Gal antibodies and genetic engineering of swine to express human complement regulatory proteins on porcine xenografts to decrease complement deposition and tissue injury. However, some of these complement regulatory proteins also serve as cellular receptors for human pathogens (e.g. CD46 and measles) to which swine are not naturally susceptible. Consequently, it is possible that human measles virus might be given an opportunity to grow in transgenic porcine cells and have the capacity to infect either the transgenic swine, or transgenic xenografts in human hosts (33) . It is also notable that natural antibodies may provide an immunological defense against human infection by retroviruses, parasites and other common organisms carrying Gal epitopes. Thus, depletion of anti-Gal antibodies may, theoretically, allow transmission of porcine viruses (carrying the Gal epitope) from a porcine xenograft to the host. However, the role of such antibodies in vivo remains unknown.",

Accordingly, lists have been generated to guide the breeding of source animals for xenotransplantation including organisms thought likely to cause disease in xenograft recipients based on known ability to infect humans (Toxoplasma gondii), similarity to organisms commonly causing infection in transplant recipients (e.g. pocine cytomegalovirus), or organisms with a high predilection for recombination (e.g. parvovirus).

Swine can be classified according to whether their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) either do or do not transmit PERV to human cells in vitro. Such animals are termed either 'transmitters' or 'nontransmitters'. High-titer human-tropic PERVs isolated from 'transmitting' animals are recombinants between PERV-A and PERV-C sequences (38, 47) . Although the site of recombination varies, viral sequences are derived from the recombination of PERV-A elements with the post-VRA (envelope) region of PERV-C. Therefore, although PERV-C is not capable of infecting human cells, it appears to be an essential component of high-titer human-tropic PERV from these swine and may be important in the assessment of infectious risk associated with xenotransplantation. The source of such recombinants in vivo is unknown; analysis of the germ-line DNA of transmitting animals has not identified the presence of such recombinant viruses (48) . Thus, swine with incomplete genomic provirus (i.e. Porcine endogenous retrovirus A without a complete env gene) might be able to generate infectious recombinant viruses in the presence of infectious PERV-C. No evidence of infection has been demonstrated of human cells in vivo and no disease resulting from this family of viruses has been described in swine or humans to date (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) . Porcine endogenous retrovirus appears to be susceptible to currently available antiviral agents (55) . Some data suggest that primary cell lines of primates (baboons, gorilla, and macaques) can be infected by PERV-A, -B, and possibly -C, which enhances the value of preclinical studies in primates (56) . However, other studies question the value of these models, as the infection of nonhuman primate tissues is often abortive. Whether humans are equally nonpermissive remains to be determined.",

Extensive molecular screening identified three families of herpesviruses in swine: porcine CMV, and porcine lymphotropic virus-1 and -2 (PLHV-1, -2). Replication of porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is enhanced by intensive immune suppression in pig-toprimate models of xenotransplantation (21, 22) . Porcine cytomegalovirus infection causes tissue-invasive infection in porcine xenografts in baboon hosts and contributes to endothelial injury and consumptive coagulopathy (CC) in some animals (57) . Based on molecular and histological evaluations, PCMV does not appear to cause invasive disease in tissues of baboons that have received porcine xenografts (21) . It is possible to exclude PCMV from herds of swine by early weaning of newborns (58) . The absence of PCMV improves graft survival and reduces coagulopathy in pig-to-baboon xenotransplantation. Recent data suggest that porcine CMV has reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir compared with human strains (59) .",

This syndrome has characteristics similar to post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) (5, 23, 24, 60) . Based on sequence analysis, this virus has some genetic homology with known sequences of lymphocryptovirus (EBV) and the rhadinoviruses (HHV8; 24) . The role of this virus in the pathogenesis of PTLD is under investigation. In porcine allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, the risk of PTLD in swine is related to the overall intensity of immune suppression, the MHC disparity between donor and host, the degree of T-cell depletion, and the PLHV activation that precedes B-cell proliferation. The role of PLHV-2 and -3 are unknown. Unlike PCMV, PLHV-1 is not removed from source animals by early weaning of newborns (61) .",

            "text": "Recent human epidemics of viral infection have been traced to animal-derived strains that have been adapted to human hosts, heightening concerns about possible animalto-human disease transmission with xenotransplantation. These include hantavirus (mice), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome owing to a new coronavirus possibly associated with civets), BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus thought to evolve from primate viruses). In each case, the epidemiology was defined after the recognition of a new clinical syndrome and the development of new, rapid, molecular assays for the causative agent [discussed in (68) ]. As an example, sporadic cases of zoonotic human infection with swine influenza A viruses have been detected in the United States, Europe, Asia, and New Zealand since 1976, most with direct evidence of exposure to swine (69, 70) . Influenza A viruses circulate in many animal hosts that may serve as a reservoir for human disease. In most cases, these viruses are not adapted for human infection and cannot cause human disease. As a result, the number of individuals affected is small compared with the number involved in pig farming (71) . Pigs may also serve as hosts for the adaptation of avian respiratory viruses to human hosts. Thus, human, porcine, and avian viruses may undergo genetic reassortment in swine to produce novel strains of pandemic potential (72) (73) (74) (75) . It is possible that infected lung xenografts might, for example, provide the 'Petri dish' for recombination between porcine and human influenza viruses, particularly in the immunocompromised host. This theoretical concern can be addressed via the breeding of herds of source animals in isolation from human respiratory viruses from animal caretakers and adventitious birds and rodents. Given highly sensitive molecular assays, it is feasible to assure that pigs used as source animals for xenografts, particularly lungs, be screened for influenza viruses.",

In xenograft recipients, these signs may be manifestations of common, community-acquired infections or latent (human) infections reactivated in the recipient. Monitoring schemes have been proposed to detect known pathogens and archive specimens from source animals, and from patients, intimate contacts, and animal handlers on a routine basis for use in the event of unexplained infectious episode. These samples may be utilized as further microbiologic assays are developed for previously unrecognized pathogens. Routine samples might be studied for the emergence of pig-derived pathogens (PERV, herpesviruses) even in the absence of clinical evidence of infection. One exciting area of research is the use of newer molecular techniques (broad-range hybridization probes or PCR primers, molecular differential display, and microarray technologies) that can be applied in xenotransplantation to detect pathogens posing a risk to xenograft recipients or their contacts.",

This is followed by empiric antimicrobial therapy and hospital admission with isolation from other patients until the nature of the process is further defined.

The identification of PERV and other viruses have allowed the development of sensitive assays for these agents and strategies for exclusion of these pathogens from xenograft donors. There may be additional human pathogens in swine not yet identified. Most should be identifiable in preclinical models while others may appear only in clinical trials. Thus, it is essential that investigators share clinical and preclinical data that suggest the presence of unusual infectious events in xenotransplantation. Without a commitment to sharing epidemiologic data, the 'occasional' infectious event or 'novel syndrome' is likely to remain unrecognized -below the 'epidemiological radar screen'. Approaches to the sharing of data internationally have been addressed (see the 'Consultation on Xenotransplantation Surveillance' sponsored by the OECD, WHO, and Health Canada, http://www.oecd.org).

Concerns regarding xenotransplantation were raised by these authors and others when clinical trials were first proposed and focused largely on those pathogens that could not be 'removed' by selective breeding -the endogenous retroviruses and possibly herpes viruses of swine. Data generated over the past 10 years suggest that the risks of human infection resulting from xenotransplantation are manageable. More so, the risk of the spread of infection to contacts of the xenograft recipient appears to be low. Careful screening and early weaning of donor swine can exclude many potential human pathogens in isolated herds with routine microbial surveillance. Unfortunately, the risk of infection will never be zero. Further studies in swine will elucidate pathogenic mecha-nisms (e.g. retroviral recombination and the pathogenesis of post-transplant lymphomas). Current data suggest, however, that consideration can now be reasonably given to research into other barriers to clinical xenotransplantation (immune and metabolic) as a prelude to clinical trials.",
