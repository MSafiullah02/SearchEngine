The germination behaviour of annual pasture species was studied by subjecting two collections of seeds taken from plants and soil-seed banks to two phytotron-simulated weather patterns: early and late autumn rains. Species from these pastures were arranged along a gradient of sensitivity to temperature on the arrival of the first persistent rain. This sensitivity was manifested in both the total germination success of the species and the germination time profile. The different germination patterns of the species can provide competitive advantages depending on the autumn weather conditions.",

Controlled tests on the influence of temperature on the germination of mediterranean annual species have focused on very few or a single species (e.g. Smith 1968; Young, Evans & Kay 1969 , 1973 . Inter-annual variations in germination timing are often attributed to differences in weather patterns (Bartolome 1979; Young et al. 1981; Ortega & Fernandez Al\u00e9s 1988) .

Talbot, Biswell & Hormay (1939) differentiated grass, filar\u00e9e and clover years, which are closely correlated with precipitation. Heady (1958) found that pasture composition is already determined before December. Talbot & Biswell (1942) observed that leguminous species are usually favoured by the late arrival of growth through the elimination of unwanted Cistus ladanifer, Lavandula stoechas and other thicket species. Each year after the summer drought, most species regenerate from the seed bank, whose composition has a high degree of similarity to the extant vegetation (Levassor, Ortega & Peco 1990 ).

The homogeneity of seed banks from slopes with the same successional age is higher than amongst those with different successional ages (Levassor, Ortega & Peco 1990) . For this reason, three slopes with different successional ages were chosen (1, 14 & 33 yr since last ploughing) as representatives of three successional stages: early, intermediate and late. From the upper and lower zones of each slope four random samples of soil were taken. Each of the 24 samples was homogenized and divided into two sub-samples, which were subjected to the above-mentioned treatments. Emerging seedlings were noted with the date of germination and removed after identification. The experiment was maintained for a 5-week period, i.e. the time difference between the weather patterns being compared. This period is sufficient to detect possible gradients in the responses of the species. 58 species from the seed bank were found.",

The seeds were stored in a dark, dry place until October 1989. The storage may have affected the germination, but such an effect would have been the same for the seeds subjected to the two treatments; thus the experiment is valid for the establishment of germination differences in 'cold' and 'warm' regimes. Two sets of 20 seeds of each species were placed in Petri dishes on blotting paper and a 1.5 cm layer of hydrophyle cotton wool, and subjected to both treatments. The number of germinated seeds of each species in each treatment was noted every day over a period of 5 weeks.",

There were quantitative differences on all slopes in terms of the number of germinations in the species (normally lower in the cold treatment), and there were no significant differences between slopes. The time pattern of treatment sensitivity was not different in the characteristic species groups of the successional determine whether these factors differed amongst grasses (Poaceae), legumes (Fabaceae), composites (Asteraceae) or other groups. Neither absolute differences between warm and cold germination nor the temporal pattern of sensitivity revealed any significant relationship in the families analysed. The same analysis applied to groups of species that are characteristic of pioneer, intermediate and mature stages was also unable to provide any significant result. Neither absolute nor profile differences in germination between both treatments function consistently in grasses, legumes, composites or other families. Although previous studies (e.g. Talbot, Biswell & Hormay 1939; Talbot & Biswell 1942; Pitt & Heady 1978) have shown that the abundance of some taxonomic groups (mainly grasses and legumes) depends on rainfall and its annual distribution, we were unable to find that this relationship is linked to germination success under different autumn-rainfall patterns. Previous seed-bank analyses have demonstrated that a transient seed bank is characteristic of therophytic vegetation (Grubb 1988; Young & Evans 1989) , and that annual legumes have a tendency to establish more or less permanent seed banks (Bartolome 1979) . Grime et al. (1981) noted rapid germination in annual grasses and forbs. In Mediterranean ecosystems, where the dry season leaves the ground practically bare, a crucial factor is occupation of space. Although high germination rates are adaptive for occupying space, species which prolong their period of germination may have other advantages -fast germinators can die if a catastrophe occurs (Grubb 1977; Mara\u00f1\u00f3n & Bartolome 1989 ). Probability of drought in periods following germination, or advantages of some species in the occupation of space during seedling establishment, may also explain differences in floristic composition which were found among different types of years.",

The overall delay in germination under the cold treatment could indicate that the experimental period of 5 weeks was not long enough for all seeds to germinate, especially in species in which this delay was more pronounced. The right-skewed shape of the warm-cold emergence differences ( Fig. 2 ) could be evidence of this, and might explain the lack of statistical significance for the species under the cold treatment. Nonetheless, only a few species need to be favoured by high temperatures for this to be manifested in an alternation of communities in years with early and late autumn rain.",
