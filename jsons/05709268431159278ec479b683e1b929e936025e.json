Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembles of two rhinolophoid bats -the great leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros armiger) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations.",

LDC echolocators can separate pulse and echo in time to avoid forward masking, whereas some species of HDC echolocators separate pulse and echo in frequency. It has been documented that rhinolophoid bats might possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems (Jones and Teeling 2006) . Recently, results from some hearing-related genes suggested sequence convergence in laryngeal echolocating bats (Li, et al. 2008; Davies, et al. 2012) . We attempted to investigate whether similar patterns can be detectable in other hearing-related genes. Furthermore, a sensory trade-off between investment in vision and echolocation has been identified (Dechmann and Safi 2009) . Loss-of-function in short-wave sensitive opsin (Sws1 gene) occurred in rhinolophoid bats, which use HDC echolocation and can emit long constant frequency calls (Zhao, et al. 2009 ). Although several bat genomes have been sequenced (Zhang, et al. 2013) , the evolutionary mechanisms of the rhinolophoid bats remains unclear. Comparative genomics will provide us opportunities to investigate whether similar patterns can be detectable in other sensory genes.",

The one-ratio model assumed an equal Ka/Ks ratio for all lineages in the phylogeny, and the two-ratio model assumed two Ka/Ks ratios: one branch for the background, one for the foreground branch leading to the specific species. Then, Clade model C was employed to test for positive selection along the rhinolophoid bats. The two clades were assumed to share sites under purifying selection and neutral evolution, but to differ at a third site partitions under divergent selection. The null model used for the Clade model C was M2a_rel (Weadick and Chang 2012) , whose LRT has a relatively lower false-positive rate. GO annotations were downloaded from Ensembl databases and were assigned to these orthologous genes. The binomial test was used to identify GO categories with more than 20 gene that had an excess of non-synonymous changes in bat lineages.

The chemosensory receptor genes in mammals have high sequence similarity. Here, we re-performed a TBlastN against the genome sequences using OR coding genes identified from each species, and the non-redundant blast-hits were used to identify the OR pseudogenes containing interrupting stop codons or frameshifts. To identify partial OR genes from these sequences, we extracted the sequences that did not have any nonsense or frameshift mutations. We then constructed a multiple alignment of these sequences together with functional OR genes by the program E-INS-i in MAFFT version 5.8 (Katoh, et al. 2002) . From those alignments, we extracted partial OR sequences that meet the following criteria. When the C-terminal region of an OR gene is missing from the genome sequence, the N-terminal region should contain an initiation codon at a proper position and should not contain any nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or long gaps. When the N-terminal region is missing, the C-terminal portion should have a stop codon at a proper position and should not contain any nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or long gaps.

To facilitate the genome annotation, we generated a high-depth transcriptome data from these two rhinolophoid bats. With repeats masked, the genome was annotated by integrating the homologous prediction, ab initio prediction and transcription-based prediction methods. As a result, a non-redundant reference gene set of 22,009 and 23,152 protein-coding genes were generated for the great leaf-nosed bat and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ( Supplementary Fig.4) , respectively. We employed CEGMA method to evaluate the completeness of genome annotation. The result showed that the vast majority of the core genes were present in our predicted gene sets (97.08% for the great leaf-nosed bat and 96.14% for the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat), indicating the completeness of gene sets identification. Next, we aligned the transcriptome sequencing reads to the predicted genes, and the result showed that approximately 96% of exons are accurately covered (96.8% for the great leaf-nosed bat and 97.1% for the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat).

Some studies insisted that bats belong to the clade of Pegasoferae which comprises chiroptera, carnivores and odd-toed ungulates (Lindblad-Toh, et al. 2011; Meredith, et al. 2011; McCormack, et al. 2012) , whereas others proposed that bats are a sister group to the clade comprising carnivores and euungulata (Pumo, et al. 1998; Murphy, et al. 2001; Murphy, et al. 2007; Song, et al. 2012; Zhang, et al. 2013) . To determine the phylogenetic position of bats within the superorder Laurasiatheria, a total of 4,569 single-copy 1:1 orthologous genes were Fig.6 ). The result based on nucleotide data was in line with previous analysis that bats are a sister group to odd-toed ungulates, whereas the result based on amino acid data supported that bat bats are sister group to the Fereuungulata (Carnivores + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla). To account for the tree discordance among loci, coalescent method was applied. Coalescent trees were highly consistent with the result inferred from amino acid data using partitioned method ( Supplementary Fig.7) . To dissect the phylogenetic signal, previously published eight different phylogenetic hypotheses ( Supplementary Fig.8) were proposed (Waddell, et al. 1999; Murphy, et al. 2001; Nishihara, et al. 2006; Prasad, et al. 2008; Lindblad-Toh, et al. 2011; Meredith, et al. 2011; McCormack, et al. 2012 Table S7 , Supplementary Fig.9 ). The result is consistent after incorporating the data from Eulipotyphyla group ( Supplementary Fig.10) . We subsequently estimated the divergence time among these 14 mammalian species. The bat lineage seems to be diverged from Fereuungulata around 81 million years ago, and the rhinolophoid bats seem to be diverged from the Old World fruit bats around 68 million years ago.",

Functional annotation showed that gene family contraction mainly included many olfactory receptor gene families in both rhinolophoid bat lineages (Supplementary Table S8 ), which is consistent with the result that the olfactory system is aberrant in some echolocating bats. Many of the expanded gene families in both rhinolophoid bats are significantly enriched in immune-related functional categories (Supplementary Table S9 ).

In Old World fruit bats, olfaction appears to be of particular importance, and fruit bats can find food from scent cues. Animals that rely heavily on the sense of smell tend to have large numbers of OR genes, while species that always use other senses have fewer functional OR genes (Niimura and Nei 2007) . It has been suggested that bats displayed a diverse olfaction abilities. In order to describe the diversity of bat OR gene repertoires, we identified the entire set of OR genes of four bat species (Supplementary methods, Supplementary Table S13 ). In line with previous work (Hayden, et al. 2014) , we observed that echolocating bats have less fraction of OR pseudogenes (18% for the great leaf-nosed bat, 16% for the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and 14% for the little brown bat) than non-echolocating bats (26% for the large flying fox). However, further analysis showed that the large flying fox and little brown bat have more than 400 intact OR genes while these two rhinolophoid bats only have <300 intact OR genes. This finding is consistent with the result that rhinolophoid bats have a relatively small olfactory epithelium than the frugivorous Pteropodidae (Neuweiler 2000) . Next, we reconstructed a protein neighbor-joining tree of all newly identified intact OR genes in bats (Fig. 3a) . It is obvious that OR genes can be classified into two distinct classes based on sequence similarity: Class I, postulated to bind to water-borne molecules, and Class II, hypothesized to bind to airborne molecules. The exact number of OR genes in each class/OR family are shown (Supplementary Table   S14 , Table S15 ). It seems that four bat species contain similar number of OR genes in Class I, while OR gene contraction occurred in two rhinolophoid bats in Class II .",

To further understand the evolutionary changes of OR gene repertoires, we estimated the gains and losses of the OR genes in a diverse range of mammals (Supplementary methods). Evolutionary changes in the number of OR genes in mammals have been shown in Fig. 3b . We can clearly identify an extensive OR gene contraction events occurred to the branch leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. This finding also suggests massive \"birth-and-death\" of OR genes in the bat species. Table S18 ). Since high omega may be due to stochastic effect caused by extremely small sample size, we removed these genes with omega value of 999. The result is also stable that more positively selected genes were detected in the branches leading to echolocating bats (12 genes, great leaf-nosed bat, P = 9.1E-5; 10 genes, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, P = 8.8E-3; 10 genes, little brown bat, P = 0.011). Next, branch model (two-ratio model) was carried out with the attempt to detect genes with accelerated evolution in the bat species. The result further indicated that more hearing-related genes have higher \u0277 values on the branches leading to echolocating bats than all other lineages (Supplementary Table S19) . Clade model C implemented in PAML was employed (Weadick and Chang 2012) , and the result also persisted that more positively selected genes were detected in the branches leading to echolocating bats (Supplementary Table S20 ). Moreover, a significant association between the average number of non-synonymous substitutions for all the hearing-related genes leading to each mammalian species and the estimated frequency of best hearing sensitivity for that species (r = 0.84, P = 0.00032, Fig. 4 ) was observed. No significant correlation between such hearing frequencies and number of synonymous changes was observed (P = 0.132). A significant association between the number of non-synonymous changes between sister taxa was observed (r = 0.67, P = 0.006). It is obvious that echolocating bats have typically undergone many more non-synonymous changes in the hearing-related genes than non-echolocating mammals. These results indicated the evolution of ultrasonic hearing in the rhinolophoid bats has involved in adaptive amino acid replacements in the hearing-related genes, which provided evidence conferring greater auditory sensitivity to ultrasonic frequency.",

Further analyses showed that echolocating bats are paraphyletic based on synonymous substitutions, whereas the non-synonymous trees revealed monophyly of laryngeal echolocators for only one hearing-related genes (STRC gene, Supplementary Fig.12 ). Next, multivariate analyses of protein polymorphism (MAPP) was employed to detect the physicochemical impact of convergent substitutions in echolocating bats. MAPP scores were estimated for the amino acid variants nested in the STRC gene, and the result showed that these replacements had important functional effects (MAPP score = 18.61, P = 1.44E-4 for H28Q; MAPP score = 10.33, P = 3.98E-3 for A39T; MAPP score = 7.37, P = 2.27E-2 for V169I). We further measured the number of sites with convergent amino acid substitutions along the branches as a direct measurement of sequence convergence, and found that the number of convergent sites in the branch pairs is proportional to the number of divergent sites ( Supplementary Fig.13 ). The number of convergent sites in the laryngeal echolocating bats does not significantly exceed that between the branch pair of the little brown bat and large flying fox, given their numbers of divergent sites (Supplementary Table S22 ). No significant differences was observed in the total number of sites that have experienced convergent substitutions from hearing-related genes. This result indicated that there is no exceptional genomic signature indicative of adaptive convergence between laryngeal echolocating bats, and genes with adaptive convergent substitutions might confine to few specific genes.",

They are heavily reliant on hearing for a variety of ecologically important roles. Previous works have documented that hearing-related genes are predominantly evolutionarily conserved in mammals (Kirwan, et al. 2013) . Here, we found evidence that some hearing-related genes have undergone Darwinian selection associated with the evolution of specialized constant frequency echolocation. Positive selection acting on hearing-related genes in rhinolophoid bats might result from the extreme selectivity used in auditory processing by these bats. Many previous works have reported the sequence convergence of some hearing-related genes reuniting echolocating bats (Li, et al. 2008; Liu, et al. 2011; Davies, et al. 2012; . We found no genome-wide sequence convergence for echolocation, indicating erroneous phylogenetic grouping are still rare It has been suggested that the enlargement of one area of brain might be associated with the reduction in size of other brain area (Harvey and Krebs 1990) . The auditory cortex and the inferior colliculus are extremely enlarged in the volume in laryngeal echolocating bats (especially in rhinolophoid bats), while visual brain areas are relatively enlarged in Old World fruit bats (Dechmann and Safi 2009 ). The trade-off has been proposed in investment in brain tissues because of the extreme energetic demands imposed by neural processing. Our result showed more visual perception genes have become pseudogenes in rhinolophoid bats, and it is reasonable to speculate that some visual perception gene may have undergone relaxed natural selection in echolocating bats. Meanwhile, positive selection acting on some hearing-related genes was identified. Such concordance suggests that some genes are impacted by natural selection, which raised the possibility that changes at the sensory genes will have direct consequences for those genes controlling for other sensory modalities, perhaps via trade-offs. This finding supports the longstanding but weakly supported assumption that bats are experiencing trade-off between vision and audition .",

The genome re-sequencing analysis has been performed based generally on the following considerations: 1) to characterize the genetic diversity and patterns of evolution; 2) to understand the genetic bases of adaptation to high altitude in the great leaf-nosed bats. Efforts for the conservation measures will benefit from the knowledge of population genetic structure of the great leaf-nosed bats. Here, we found very little differentiation among populations, which suggests universal inter-region gene flows or incomplete lineage sorting. A broader geographical scale analysis is needed in the future. Furthermore, we provided evidence of genetic adaptation in the great leaf-nosed bat that are associated with high altitude. Selective sweep mapping was conducted for populations from different altitudes, and identified several hypoxia-related genes with a high extent of differentiation on the genome scale. EPAS1 is transcription factor that respond to the changes in the available oxygen in the cellular environment under high-altitude conditions, and mutations at EPAS1 are tightly associated with hematologic phenotypes (van Patot and Gassmann 2011). Previous works have documented that EPAS1 polymorphisms are associated with Tibetan people with lower hemoglobin concentrations (Beall, et al. 2010) . A loss-of-function role of EPAS1 might exist in high-altitude adaptation. So, our result indicated potential high-altitude hypoxia adaptation mechanisms of the great leaf-nosed bat. Our work is based on a limited genome re-sequencing resource, and data from more samples are necessary for future work. However, false positives notwithstanding, the results provided valuable staring points for experimental follow-up, and suggested an initial evolutionary scenario of bats in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia.",

These genes participate in phototransduction in the retina, dim-light adaptation, or color vision, etc. We next incorporated genes belonging to more visual-related GO categories, and identified more genes (15 genes, Supplementary Table S23, S24) that might have lost their functions due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons in rhinolophoid bats.

Furthermore, positively selected genes in the rhinolophoid bats are highly enriched in some immune related functional categories (Supplementary Table S25, 26), for example, regulation of innate immune response (GO:0045088, P = 0.0053, 5 genes), regulation of T cell differentiation (GO:0045580, P = 0.033, 6 genes), regulation of T cell activation (GO:0050863, P = 0.044, 8 genes) in the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat; regulation of innate immune response (GO:0045088, P = 0.02, 7 genes), T cell differentiation (GO:0030217, P = 0.009, 7 genes) in the great leaf-nosed bat. Additionally, we found that DNA repair pathway is over-represented among the positively selected genes in both rhinolophoid bats. DNA repair machinery of host cells can recognize viral genetic material as abnormal and damaged DNA. So, DNA repair apparatus becomes part of the innate intracellular defense against foreign invaders. Overall, these lines of evidence indicate a well-developed immune defense system against virus and microbial infection in rhinolophoid bats.",
