It leads to a misuse of animal resources and to economic loss for the dairy farmer, due to loss of milk production, extra labor, loss of income from the sale of carcasses, and increased replacement costs as the herd turnover rate increases, as well as the cost for cadaver transport and incineration.",

The results from these studies differ but some are in concordance. Previous studies have identified that an increased proportion of purchased cows (Thomsen et al., 2006; Raboisson et al., 2011), no pasture-grazing (Thomsen et al., 2006; Burow et al., 2011; Dechow et al., 2011), larger herd sizes (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2000; Raboisson et al., 2011) and lower herd average milk yield (Smith et al., 2000; Thomsen et al., 2006), are all factors associated with increased MR. In contrast, Menzies et al. (1995) did not find any effect of herd size on mortality and Miller et al. (2008) found a small but consistent decrease in death frequency as herd size increased. Also, N\u00f8rgaard et al. (1999) found an increase in mortality with increasing average milk yield. These studies were, however, carried out in different countries under varying conditions and this may explain the sometimes conflicting results. Swedish dairy production has undergone large structural changes during the last years and dairy cow mortality has not been thoroughly studied previously. Therefore, a need exists to identify risk factors for mortality also under Swedish production conditions. Such information is of interest not only for improving the management routines, but also for policy makers (e.g., in relation to animal welfare).",

Season was treated as a categorical variable with 3 categories: winter-spring (January 1 to April 30), summer (May 1 to August 31), and autumn-winter (September 1 to December 31). This classification was done to discern the grazing period as a separate season and to enable comparison between the early and late housing period. To be able to capture potential nonlinear associations, calving interval and milk yield were treated as categorical variables with 4 categories based on quartiles: <389.3 d, 389.3 to 403.5 d, 403.6 to 421.9 d, and \u2265422.0 d; and <8,525 kg of ECM, 8,525 to 9,290 kg of ECM, 9,291 to 9,980 kg of ECM, and \u22659,981 kg of ECM, respectively.

As this period is longer in southern Sweden (4 mo) compared with the northern parts (2 or 3 mo), a pasture variable was created as a categorical variable with 3 classes: 2, 3, and 4 mo of legislated pasture period (SJVFS, 2010).

This increasing trend is consistent with the results from other studies performed in countries with intensive milk production (Thomsen et al., 2004; Thomsen and Houe, 2006; USDA, 2007; Miller et al., 2008), but the average rate in our study is in the upper range of what others have found (Thomsen and Houe, 2006; USDA, 2007; Pinedo et al., 2010; Burow et al., 2011; Raboisson et al., 2011). Dairy cattle production in Sweden has undergone considerable changes during the last decade, with an increase in the average herd size from approximately 40 to 60 cows. During 2002 to 2010, the proportion of small herds (<50 cows) has decreased from 71 to 52%, and the portion of cows in small herds has decreased from 48 to 25%. In the same time period, the portion of large herds (>200 cows) has increased from 0.8 to 2.8%, and the portion of cows in large herds has increased from 5 to 12% (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). Also, more herds are being kept in freestalls than in tie-stalls, there is an increased use of AMS, and SH are increasingly replacing SR cows, with an accompanying, relatively modest increase in average milk yield (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). However, neither the increased herd size nor increased use of SH cows can be the only reasons for the increasing mortality, although both factors are identified as risk factors in our analyses, because also the MR ratios from the multivariable analyses (Table 4) show an increasing trend over the years. A change in regulations at slaughter (European Union regulation number 854/2004), only allowing healthy animals, was implemented in 2006 and may explain some of the increased risk for on-farm euthanasia. Further studies are needed to fully explain the increasing mortality.",

Thomsen et al. (2006) demonstrated decreased mortality risk (odds ratio 0.93) with an increased mean milk yield per cow-year of 1,000 kg. Also, a herd average milk production level greater than 9,072 kg had death losses of 5.9% compared with death losses of 7.7% that were found in herds producing less than 7,258 kg of milk (Smith et al., 2000). By contrast, Miller et al. (2008) found that death frequency increased with 0.4% when the average milk yield per cow increased by 1,000 kg in Holsteins and Jerseys and Dematawewa and Berger (1998) showed that high-producing cows are less likely to survive. An explanation for the association in our study might be that milk yield at a herd level may be more associated with the level of management. High average milk yields as in this study cannot be achieved without good management. A farmer who is able to obtain a high milk production probably also does many other things right, thereby decreasing the risk of cows dying. Also, this association between high milk yield and reduced mortality is valid only at a herd level. Extrapolating to the individual cow level may be an \u201cecological fallacy\u201d (Robinson, 2009; i.e., associations at the herd level may not necessarily apply at the cow level).",

In larger herds, less time is generally available to spend on individual cows (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 1999). Also, pasture management becomes more complicated in larger herds. Decreased grazing time or zero grazing has been associated with increased mortality (Thomsen et al., 2006; Burow et al., 2011) and with a higher proportion of loser cows (Thomsen et al., 2007). Zero grazing is not allowed in Sweden, according to legislation, and dairy cows have to be given the opportunity to graze for at least 6 h a day for 2 to 4 mo, depending on the region (SJVFS, 2010). At least 80% of the pasture has to be covered with grass, but the quality of the offered pasture is not regulated or controlled, and problems related to grazing may still be part of the explanation for the association between herd size and mortality in Sweden. This may also be supported by the interaction between herd size and season, showing a slightly reduced beneficial status during autumn-winter for the larger herds (i.e., the difference between autumn-winter and winter-spring is decreasing with increasing herd size; Table 4). Single-year analysis showed that herds with \u2265200 cows had a different seasonal pattern of MR ratio (Table 5) but still, this largest herd size group has a greater MR ratio than other herd size groups.",

            "text": "In agreement with our study, Miller et al. (2008) found that deaths were most frequent in July and least frequent in November. Hertl et al. (2011) demonstrated that season had no effect on probability of mortality in primiparous cows, but found that multiparous cows were more likely to die in spring and summer than in fall or winter. Also, Pinedo et al. (2010) showed that annualized death rates were highest in spring and summer (7.8 and 6.9%, respectively) and lowest during autumn (5.5%). An Italian study (Vitali et al., 2009) demonstrated, however, that the spring season had the lowest frequency of deaths and the summer season the highest, as a consequence of heat-related stress, which agrees with Crescio et al. (2010) who found that increases in the temperature-humidity index above a certain threshold resulted in higher risk of mortality. No significant seasonal variation was observed by Faye and Perochon (1995), although they found that the beginning of the grazing period seemed to be associated with a higher MR. It can be debated if the high MR ratio observed during summer is a consequence of the previous indoor period or if it is due to the possible heat stress for cows on pasture (Kendall et al., 2006). Burow et al. (2011) found that free access between barn and pasture was associated with higher mortality compared with systems where the farmer followed the herd out to the pasture and then brought them home for milking. Burow et al. (2011) proposed that less frequent observation of the cows (and the associated nonidentification of sick cows) could be part of the explanation. A lesser MR ratio during autumn-winter can be a positive effect of the previous pasture season, as Alban and Agger (1996) found that grazing is associated with better health. Burow et al. (2011) and Dechow et al. (2011) concluded that the more time cows spend on pasture, the lower the mortality. This is also supported by our results showing that regions with a longer pasture period, according to legislation, had a lower MR ratio. In Sweden, no seasonal calving pattern exists and the differences in death frequency are, therefore, not a consequence of unequal calving distribution.",

(2009) compared 20 organic and 20 conventional managed herds in Sweden, and demonstrated a decreased likelihood of infection with bovine corona virus and bovine syncytial virus in organically managed herds. The beneficial status in the organic herds may partly be explained by the closely regulated animal trading, which only allows trading between organic herds. Recommendations also exist relating to quarantine before introducing new animals (Swedish Organic Certification Association, 2011), which may decrease the risk of introducing infectious diseases that increases the risk for on-farm mortality. In addition, organic herds generally have a longer, and more regulated, pasture season. Accordingly, organically managed cows in Sweden have to get >6 kg of the daily DMI from the pasture and spend at least 12.5 h per day on pasture during the pasture season (Swedish Organic Certification Association, 2011). There are also managerial differences between organic and conventional herds that may explain the differences. Some of them, such as herd size, milk yield, housing system and breed, were accounted for in the multivariable analyses (Table 5) and additional explanations should be investigated further.",

            "text": "Cows of the SH breed have in several other studies been shown to have a higher incidence of the common production diseases, such as mastitis and ketosis, among others, compared with cows of the SR breed (Bendixen et al., 1988; Emanuelson et al., 1993; Nyman et al., 2007; Persson Waller et al., 2009) and also a higher culling risk (del P. Schneider et al., 2007; Dechow et al., 2011). In this study, we found a higher MR ratio in herds with predominantly SH cows (Tables 4 and 5), which is in line with the results of Hare et al. (2006), Thomsen et al. (2006), and Raboisson et al. (2011). By contrast, Miller et al. (2008) found only negligible differences due to breed when comparing Holstein, Jersey, and other breeds. The main difference between SH and SR cows is the higher yield (in kilograms of milk) in SH cows, although the yield in kilograms of solids is almost equal (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). However, other differences also exist, such as size and conformation (e.g., udder and stature), which may contribute to the differences in mortality that we observed in the multivariable analyses, where milk yield was also included in the models. Indications of differences in immunological and metabolic patterns also exist between the 2 breeds (Nyman et al., 2008).",

We would argue that calving interval at a herd level in this case may serve as a proxy for good management, as has also been indicated by Sandgren et al. (2009) and Nyman et al. (2011), and that the high level of management needed to achieve short calving intervals also increases the probability for low on-farm mortality.",

A possible explanation for the higher MR ratio in Norrland compared with S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland is that distances between farmers, veterinarians, and abattoirs are longer in Norrland, but this cannot explain the numerically higher MR ratio in \u00d6stra G\u00f6taland and V\u00e4stra Svealand.

However, a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was also tested because there was an excess of zero counts in the data set. The ZINB model handles zero counts in 2 separate ways: by logistic regression, where the probability of mortality is the outcome, and by negative binomial regression, where the mortality risk is estimated conditional on occurring mortality in the herd (Dohoo et al., 2009). The Vuong test showed that a ZINB model fit the data better compared with the negative binomial model. However, none of the predictors became significant in the logistic portion of the ZINB model and the information from the ZINB model was equal to the information gained from the negative binomial model. Therefore, the ZINB model was rejected and a negative binomial regression model was used for the analyses because of the much easier interpretation. The model evaluation indicated a lack of fit, but this was mainly due to the observations with high mortality, which were not predicted well by the model and, thus, not due to an excess of zero counts in the data.",
