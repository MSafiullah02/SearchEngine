Median duration and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated to describe virus-specific shedding, and shedding was compared between viruses using a binary variable indicating the occurrence of documented shedding duration exceeding 7 days. Pairwise correlations between the prevalence and quantity of specific viruses were determined by Pearson correlation coefficients displayed with a heat map (R, Vienna, Austria). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing differences in patient characteristics and illness symptoms between multiple virus and single virus illnesses were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a robust estimator to account for correlation in events measured from the same children.

The frequency of additional virus detection during follow-up varied by specific virus: only 1 of 53 (2%) RSV detections occurred for the first time after one week of illness, followed by 6 of 78 (8%) for PIV types 1\u20134, 4 of 26 (15%) for HMPV, 14 of 70 for HCoV (20%), 3 of 15 (20%) for influenza, 25 of 121 (21%) for HBoV, 27 of 122 (22%) for AdV, and 38 of 223 (17%) for HRV.

This percentage of illnesses with multiple viruses (47%) was higher than other recent studies of viral coinfections that have found multiple viruses in up to 40% of patients [2].

Children with MVIs did not have more severe illness initially than children with single virus illnesses. Children with multiple viruses detected at illness onset had significantly lower rates of fever, however children with MVIs at onset did have longer duration of illness symptoms. We have previously reported decreased severity associated with MVI in hospitalized children, with an increased risk of oxygen requirement, extended hospital stay, and inpatient and intensive care unit admission among children with SVI [32]. Our finding of decreased severity among children with MVI has been [20, 22, 23] contrasts with reports of greater severity of illness in children with MVI [1, 10\u201316]. These latter studies only collected samples at the time children were admitted to the inpatient ward or emergency department; only one study included outpatients [12]. Also, many studies addressed the severity of coinfections specifically with RSV [10\u201312, 14, 15] while we focused on MVI patterns among 15 different viruses and subtypes of viruses.",

The clinical importance of HRV detection has now clearly been associated with severe disease leading to hospitalization in children <5 years of age [33, 34]. Rhinovirus has also been identified as an important coinfection in invasive pneumococcal disease, where it is associated with increased severity of disease [7\u20139] and with invasive pneumococcal disease due to typically noninvasive pneumococcal serotypes [6]. The role of HRV in virus-virus coinfections has been unclear. HRV has been found by some investigators to be frequently codetected with other viruses [24], while others have suggested that HRV may have a competitive relationship with other viruses. In a study of 1742 specimens, Brunstein and colleagues reported a number of instances of suspected pathogen cosuppression between specific viral combinations, particularly between single-stranded RNA viruses [35]. Greer et al reported that, among 1247 specimens, HRV was negatively associated with coinfection with AdV, CoV, HBoV, HMPV, RSV, PIV, influenza A, and polyomaviruses [36].",

This finding provides supportive evidence for the possibility of co-suppression. Potentially, the immune response to a first infection decreases the risk of infection by a second virus due to the induction of cytokines or other factors known to prevent viral infection. Jartti et al reported that children with atopy have a higher risk of HRV but a lower risk of RSV [37], suggesting that the risks of acquisition of these two viruses are differentially affected by a child's immunologic state. This would make coinfections with both viruses in the same child simultaneously less likely. Other authors have similarly found nonrandom distribution of specific virus combinations [38].",

Given the high prevalence and frequent extended shedding of HBoV and HRV, it is not surprising that these viruses were frequently detected in coinfections. This may simply be a result of persistent infection extending over a prolonged time period, making it more likely for an infection with a second virus to occur. The impact of persistent shedding on the severity of incident illness remains unknown. Our study found prolonged shedding of HRV for up to 41 days by PCR and of HBoV for up to 44 days following the onset of initial symptoms. We did not detect any extended shedding of HBoV when it was detected alone, yet extended shedding of HBoV was detected in 36% of multiple virus illnesses, similar to other studies evaluating HBoV time. This suggests that 2 potential pathways of HBoV infection may exist: one with a short, acute, and more symptomatic, single virus infection (perhaps the primary infection) and the other pathway with a long-shedding, perhaps more indolent, infection during which other viruses are frequently detected.",
