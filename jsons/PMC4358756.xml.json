Vimentin is the most abundant IF protein and has a critical role in stabilizing intracellular architecture2. Until recently, the importance of vimentin remained elusive because vimentin knockout (Vim\u2212/\u2212) mice displayed a relatively normal phenotype3. However, a thorough characterization of Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice under stress conditions revealed prominent abnormalities4,5,6, complementing the metabolic, signalling and regulatory abnormalities displayed by patients with IF-related diseases and mice expressing functional mutations in IFs2,7,8,9,10. Recently, evidence to support a role for IFs as scaffolds for macromolecular complexes involved in critical cell signalling functions was reported11,12. In this study, we demonstrate that vimentin is required for the activation of the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, a macromolecular complex that orchestrates early inflammatory responses of the innate immune system.",

The wide range of pathogens known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome suggests that NLRP3 indirectly senses microbes by probing for host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns that are produced or released after cellular or tissue injury17,18. For example, uric acid released from cells exposed to bleomycin triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to maturation of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and inflammation19. In both human patients and animals treated with bleomycin, IL-1\u03b2 released from injured cells results in production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), which contributes to the development of pulmonary fibrosis20. In addition, exposure to crystalline particles such as asbestos and silica also cause pulmonary fibrosis21 that is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome22,23.",

Unlike other inflammasome-associated Nod-like receptor (NLR) proteins, NLRP3 is expressed at very low levels in naive macrophages. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct pro-inflammatory stimuli. In the first step, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling activates NF-\u03baB and upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b224. The second step involves the assembly of the multiprotein complex, which induces self-cleavage of caspase-1, which in turn mediates the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its biologically active form25. The mechanism by which the inflammasome is ultimately activated is still a subject of intensive research.",

Histopathological examination showed that lungs of LPS-treated WT mice had more severe alveolar damage characterized by interstitial oedema and more fluid and debris in the airspace than in LPS-treated Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1b). Wild-type mice exposed to LPS exhibited an increase in wet-to-dry lung weight ratio and total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), whereas Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to exhibit such an increase (Fig. 1c,d). Exposure to LPS is followed by large increases in immune cells in the airspace29,30. Therefore, to further characterize the nature of immune cell recruitment into the lungs, we performed a systematic flow cytometric analysis of whole-lung lysates31. No differences were observed in the myeloid cell population between WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with saline (Supplementary Fig. 1a). As expected, both WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with LPS had significant increases in neutrophils and moderate increases in macrophages compared with saline-treated animals (Supplementary Fig. 1a); no differences were observed between WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with LPS (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

In a model of asbestosis, we sought to determine whether Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice showed diminished cytokine production and whether these animals were protected from lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. Wild-type and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice were exposed to crocidolite asbestos or an inert particle, titanium dioxide (TiO2); markers of injury, inflammation, cytokine production and fibrosis were assessed. Confirming previous reports22,23, asbestos-exposed mice had increased total cell numbers in BALF compared with TiO2-exposed animals. However, significantly fewer cells were recruited to the lungs of Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice after asbestos exposure (Fig. 2a). Additional analysis of immune cell recruitment into the lungs of WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of whole-lung lysates (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Wild-type mice had profound inflammatory cell infiltrates following exposure to asbestos as observed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining; in contrast Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Wild-type mice exhibited an increase in total protein concentration in BALF, whereas Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to exhibit such an increase (Fig. 2b). The reduction in inflammation in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice exposed to asbestos was associated with reduced levels of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 in BALF compared with WT mice (Fig. 2c,d). These data suggest that vimentin is required for asbestos-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (step 2), but not for NF-\u03baB activation and upregulation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 (step 1). Furthermore, we observed that WT mice exposed to asbestos develop pulmonary fibrosis, as assessed by Masson trichrome and Picrosirius red stain (a dye that binds specifically to collagen fibrils, Fig. 2e) and Sircol assay (Fig. 2f). Vimentin deficiency prevented pulmonary fibrosis, as no significant increase in collagen deposition was observed in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2e,f). Collectively, these results demonstrate that loss of vimentin prevents asbestos-induced collagen deposition and fibrosis.",

Moreover, bleomycin-induced fibrosis has been shown to be dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome35. WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice were exposed to bleomycin for 5 days. WT mice displayed intense lung inflammation as assessed by H&E staining (Fig. 3a), increased wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (Fig. 3b), and increased protein concentration in BALF (Fig. 3c). All of these end points were significantly attenuated in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3a\u2013c). Exposure to bleomycin resulted in a large increase in immune cells in the airspace of both WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of whole-lung lysates (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to exhibit an increase in caspase-1 (Fig. 3d) and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3e) in BALF following the exposure to bleomycin; in contrast, WT mice showed a robust activation of caspase-1 and production of mature IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3d,e). As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, macrophage-produced IL-1\u03b2 is known to induce production of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We observed that WT mice, but not Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice, had increased levels of IL-6 following the exposure to bleomycin (Fig. 3f). TGF-\u03b21 is a critical mediator of remodelling and fibrotic responses in the lung. Total TGF-\u03b21 was detected after activation in BALF from WT mice 5 days following the exposure to bleomycin, but remained at the baseline level in BALF from Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3g). No significant difference was observed between WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice in NLRP3 inflammasome-independent cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 (Fig. 3h,i). Interestingly, IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels were increased in the lungs of both WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice following the exposure to bleomycin (Supplementary Fig. 3b).",

Lung compliance is influenced by the underlying connective tissue, which is rich in extracellular matrix components such as collagen37. Because Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited less collagen deposition following treatment with either bleomycin or asbestos, we reasoned that lungs of these mice would maintain normal compliance. To test this hypothesis, we measured the lung mechanics of WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice using a SCIREQ ventilator 21 days following the bleomycin administration. In comparison with saline treatments, lungs of WT mice exhibited a 2.5-fold decrease in quasi-static compliance following the bleomycin administration, whereas the compliance of lungs from Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice decreased only 1.3-fold (Fig. 4e). Bleomycin administration creates heterogeneous regions of lung fibrosis in mice (Fig. 4a), which is a pathologic feature of the human disease as well38. To assess focal changes in lung tissue stiffness, we performed regional nano-indentations on lung sections (200\u2013400 \u03bcm thick) using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The micro-indentations provide a measure of the stiffness or elastic modulus (E) of lung tissue, which is inversely related to lung compliance. Elasticity maps from AFM micro-indentation from bleomycin-treated WT lungs clearly displayed the wide ranges of tissue stiffness (Fig. 4c), which corresponded to the heterogeneity of collagen deposition (Fig. 4a). The median elastic modulus of lung parenchymal tissue from WT mice increased 2.4-fold in response to bleomycin compared with control lung tissue (27 to 7.5 kPa, respectively), whereas the elastic modulus of lung tissue from bleomycin-treated Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly decreased (P<0.0001) compared with WT bleomycin-treated lung tissue (Fig. 4f). The wide range of E-values is reflected in the frequency of occurrence and in the median and interquartile ranges for each condition (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In addition, there was a strong correlation (Pearson r=\u22120.99) between the mean compliance values for each condition and the mean E-values for each condition (for example, WT-bleomycin-AFM versus WT-bleomycin-SCIREQ). Thus, the mechanical properties of the lung were preserved in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice following the bleomycin treatment, which is evident at both the global tissue scale and in focal regions of lung.",

Secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5c), IL-6 (Fig. 5d) and TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. 5e) in the BALF of WT mice significantly increased in response to bleomycin; the response in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly attenuated. Finally, WT mice displayed a significant degree of collagen deposition and fibrosis, as shown by Masson trichrome (Fig. 5g) and Picrosirius red stain (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and Sircol assay (Fig. 5f), whereas this response was severely attenuated in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 5c).

An inflammatory stimulus, such as LPS, primes cells to transcribe and synthesize pro-IL-1\u03b2 (signal 1) and then another stimulus such as extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), monosodium urate (MSU) or asbestos (signal 2) is necessary for inflammasome complex formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation19,22,39. To further investigate the possibility that NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires vimentin, we isolated primary alveolar macrophages from WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice. Macrophages were primed with LPS and stimulated with ATP as previously described39. Levels of mature caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly increased in the supernatants collected from WT macrophages following LSP and ATP treatment compared with saline treatment, but in the supernatant collected from Vim\u2212/\u2212 macrophages there was only a slight increase (Fig. 6a,b). There was no difference in pro-IL-1\u03b2 levels in total cell lysates between activated WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 alveolar macrophages (Fig. 6c; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7). As an independent approach, we expressed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to vimentin (VimKD) or a scrambled shRNA (Ctrl) in J774a.1 macrophages and treated the cells with ATP. Caspase-1 is required to cleave pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its biologically active form and like other caspases is proteolytically activated from a pro-enzyme to produce a tetramer of its two active subunits, p20 and p10 (ref. 28). The levels of mature caspase-1 p20, but not pro-caspase-1, were considerably reduced in VimKD cells (Fig. 6d,e; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7) compared with Ctrl cells treated with ATP, further supporting the hypothesis that vimentin deficiency prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

A human macrophage-like cell line was treated with silencing RNA (siRNA) targeted to vimentin (VimKD) or a scrambled siRNA (CT; Fig. 7a; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 8) and subsequently activated with MSU. No differences were observed in the levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 between CT and VimKD cells (Fig. 7a), suggesting that vimentin deficiency does not impair signal 1. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was repressed in VimKD cells as assessed by IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1 levels in cell supernatants (Fig. 7b,c). Similar results were obtained when CT and VimKD cells were activated with asbestos (Fig. 7b,c). In addition, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from WT and Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice, primed with LPS and activated with MSU. Caspase-1 activation was assessed using a specific fluorescent probe, FAM-YVAD-FMK41. WT BMDMs showed robust caspase-1 activation following treatment with MSU, with caspase-1 forming aggregates throughout the cytoplasm. However, caspase-1 activation was severely reduced in BMDMs isolated from Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7d). No caspase-1 activation was observed in untreated BMDMs isolated from either WT or Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Furthermore, the vimentin network spanned the cytoplasm in the WT activated cells, whereas in unstimulated cells, the network appeared to be collapsed around the nucleus and lamellipodia were not observed (Fig. 8d). Vimentin filaments (red) strongly co-localized with NLRP3 (green) in both perinuclear and distal regions of the cells. Co-localization studies were performed using Fiji 1.48r (64-bit, win) and the Coloc 2 test43. Co-localization analyses were calculated on ROIs drawn around the lamellipodia, determined by the vimentin image. The thresholded Manders co-localization scores were 0.89\u00b10.15 for vimentin and 0.86\u00b10.18 for NLRP3. NLRP3 and ASC also co-localized in stimulated macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 5); the score for NLRP3 co-localization with ASC in untreated cells was 0.20\u00b10.11, indicating weak co-localization. In contrast, the score for NLRP3 co-localization with ASC in cells treated with ATP was 0.85\u00b10.21, indicating strong co-localization. However, knockdown of vimentin resulted in a lack of co-localization between NLRP3 and ASC, even in activated macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 5).

In fact, IL-1\u03b2 produced by the inflammasome has been recently identified as an initiator of fibrosis in response to bleomycin35, and administration of IL-1\u03b2 alone recapitulates much of the lung pathology caused by bleomycin47. Because vimentin-deficient mice did not produce the same amount of IL-1\u03b2 as WT mice, we reasoned that Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice would be protected from bleomycin- and asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Indeed, lung pathology was significantly reduced in vimentin-deficient mice, pointing to the essential role of vimentin in pulmonary fibrosis. We found substantially less collagen deposition in Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice. The excessive collagen deposition in lungs of WT mice led to loss of mechanical compliance, whereas the lungs of Vim\u2212/\u2212 mice maintained compliance similar to that of saline-treated mice. These results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating decreases in the compliance of fibrotic lungs33. The elastic modulus measurements strongly suggest that increased tissue stiffness at the microscale corresponds to areas of increased collagen deposition. Importantly, macroscale measurements of lung compliance were highly correlated with the microscale elastic modulus measurements obtained by AFM.",

These phenotypes led us to investigate whether vimentin might serve as a scaffold for the inflammasome by binding to one or more proteins in the inflammasome complex. Several studies have suggested that IFs, including vimentin, act as scaffolds for signalling molecules2,11,12. In fact, vimentin interacts with and is involved in the translocation of pERK1/2 to the nucleus51, limits the ability of 14-3-3 to interact with Raf and CdK1, and regulates the release and translocation of ROK\u03b1 following RhoA activation. These findings exemplify how vimentin IFs can act as scaffolds for signalling molecules. Recently, vimentin was reported to bind to NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2), a member of the NLR family, via the leucin-rich-repeat (LRR)52. The LRR is a protein-binding domain shared by 19 other NLR family members, including NLRP3. Therefore, we sought to determine whether vimentin interacts with NLRP3. In our experiments, immunoprecipitation of both NLRP3 and caspase-1 in lysates from WT alveolar macrophages resulted in a robust co-precipitation of vimentin, which was enhanced following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These data were confirmed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of human and murine macrophages. The co-localization score for vimentin with NLRP3 was 0.89\u00b10.15, indicating strong co-localization43. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate a direct protein\u2013protein interaction between vimentin and NLRP3 by BLI assays, further establishing a role for vimentin in assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

            "text": "We can only speculate about where and how vimentin associates with NLRP3 and caspase-1 during inflammasome assembly, since the crystal structures of the vimentin dimer and all components of the inflammasome except for PYD are unknown13,14,15. NLRP3 proteins have been shown to form inactive preassembled complexes in unstimulated cells13,14,15. Under stimulation, these proteins undergo conformational changes whereby the inflammasome is activated. The vimentin IF network could potentially associate with the NLRP3 inflammasome through one or more domains of NLRP3 and mediate the conformation change or stabilization of NLRP3 that leads to activation. We reason that vimentin may interact with NLRP3 in two distinct regions: the NACHT domain and the LRR; vimentin has been previously shown to interact with NOD2 in the LRR domain52. Because ASC is localized to the nucleus in unactivated cells, no interaction with vimentin is anticipated in nonactivated cells. Furthermore, on the basis of the structure of ASC, a PYD and CARD domain with a short linker, we do not anticipate a direct interaction with vimentin as vimentin lacks either of the ASC domains, therefore, any ASC signal following cell activation is anticipated to be due to vimentin interaction with other proteins in the inflammasome protein complex. An unresolved issue is how vimentin mediates inflammasome activation. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to inflammasome activation55. Vimentin IF are known to modulate mitochondrial motility56, and lack of vimentin results in increased ROS production57. This suggests that vimentin-deficient cells should have more robust inflammasome signalling, the exact opposite of what we have demonstrated. In a very provocative paper, however, Bauernfeind et al.24 demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived ROS is required for priming, not activation, of the inflammasome, as ROS inhibitors blocked the priming step required for NLRP3 expression, but activation was not affected. This correlates with our findings that signal 1 is unaffected by the lack of vimentin. Further studies on the relationship between vimentin, mitochondria and ROS will likely provide insights into the regulation behind both signals 1 and 2 during inflammation, but currently they are beyond the scope of this paper.",

We further demonstrate that vimentin is required for IL-1\u03b2 maturation through its interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Vimentin may act as a scaffold for assembly of the inflammasome protein complex and thus regulate its function.
