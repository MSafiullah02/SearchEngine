All patients included were seen by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and had a diagnosis of classic or incomplete KS, according to standard clinical criteria [12]. As part of an ongoing epidemiological investigation of respiratory viruses at The Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver, from November 2004 to November 2005, we archived at \u221270\u00b0C all respiratory specimens that tested negative by direct immunofluorescence (DFA) for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, and adenovirus. For each patient with KS who had a banked respiratory specimen, we identified at least 2 matched control subjects from our archived specimens. Control subjects were matched by age (within 6 months if <5 years old and within 1 year if >5 years old) and by date of specimen collection (within 1 week of the case patient). All respiratory specimens used in the study were nasopharyngeal washes. All control and KS samples came from the same pool of samples that were negative for the 7 respiratory viruses tested by DFA. Use of banked specimens and clinical data was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. All samples (from case patients and control subjects) were identified and coded at The Children\u2019s Hospital microbiology/virology laboratory and then transferred to the University of Colorado Health Science Center laboratory (Aurora, CO) for blinded analysis for HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA by reverse\u2010transcription (RT)\u2013PCR.",

Specimens were screened for the presence of HCoV\u2010NL63 by RT\u2010PCR using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random primers, followed by PCR and/or nested PCR. Amplicons were analyzed in ethidium bromide\u2013stained agarose gels. On the basis of results published elsewhere, 8 different primer sets were used [4, 5, 13]. Multiple primer sets were used purposely because of the potential variations in specificity and sensitivity caused by variations in the nucleotide sequences of different HCoV\u2010NL63 strains. Primer sets had binding sites located within the HCoV\u2010NL63 (NH strain) spike gene (primer set A, with nested primers B) [4], HCoV\u2010NL63 (NH strain) replicase 1a gene (primer set C) [4], HCoV\u2010NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene (primer set D) [13], and HCoV\u2010NL63 replicase 1b gene (primer set E with nested primer set F) [5]. Additionally, 2 sets of degenerate coronavirus primers (G and H) [4] were designed using the conserved region of the replicase 1b gene. HotStarTaq (Qiagen) was used in all PCRs, and PCR amplification programs were run as described elsewhere for each primer set. Primer set H was designed in our laboratory on the basis of a conserved region shared by HCoV\u2010NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013CoV, HCoV\u2010229E, and HCoV\u2010OC43. Primer set H consisted of forward primer 5\u2032\u2010GCGCAAAATAATGAATTAATGCC\u20103\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032\u2010CAATACAWACAAAYAGACGCWCCACC\u20103\u2032 (W, A + T; Y, C + T). The PCR amplification program was as follows: 15 min at 95\u00b0C to activate the HotStar polymerase; 10 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 60 s at 45\u00b0C, and 45 s at 72\u00b0C; followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 60 s at 50\u00b0C, and 45 s at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension of 10 min at 72\u00b0C.",

All studies of KS are limited by the time of patient presentation. It is possible that this could have falsely decreased the recovery of an etiological infectious agent. However, 80% of our samples were collected on or before day 10 of illness, and restricting our analysis to these samples did not significantly change our results. In a recent report that examined infants with lower\u2010respiratory\u2010tract infections, Kaiser et al. [18] were able to recover HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA from 3 (50%) of 6 patients in follow\u2010up samples obtained 3 weeks after their acute illness, which suggests that prolonged viral shedding can occur in the respiratory tract.",

Other researchers have made similar observations, and a recent report by Benseler et al. [19] found that one\u2010third of patients presenting with KS had a concurrent confirmed viral or bacterial infection. In addition, Rowley et al. [20] discovered that an antigen detected by immunohistochemical analysis using synthetic KS antibodies in ciliated bronchial epithelium from patients with acute KS is found in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are consistent with aggregates of viral proteins. This suggests that infection with an as\u2010yet\u2010unidentified infectious agent may be important in the pathogenesis of KS.",
