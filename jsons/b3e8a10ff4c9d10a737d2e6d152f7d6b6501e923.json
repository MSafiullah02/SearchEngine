Allocation of supplies was strictly based on the stratification of infection risk. All procedures were dynamic, and changes were implemented based on the emerging new COVID-19 knowledge to ensure up-to-date requirements and reality of managing the hospital in a challenging climate (Sun, Chen, & Viboud, 2020 Patient management and flow was regulated to safeguard in-and out-of-hospital patients. To minimize intra-hospital infection among fever patients, two COVID-19 fever clinics, independently located, were successively set-up with 17 quarantine rooms for highly suspected patients. As of 27 February 2020, the fever clinics received 3,145 patients, monitored 44 suspected patients and three patients were confirmed with COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). Hospital entrances were controlled by staff and each patient/visitor had to follow safety procedures (Figures 2 and 3) . These included temperature check and a survey of clinical history (Table 1) . Only patients with critical conditions were admitted after COVID-19 screening from 23 January-3",
