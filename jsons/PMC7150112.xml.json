            "text": "\nOn April 28, 1988, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Aloha Airlines experienced explosive decompression and structural failure at 24,000 ft. It resulted in a dramatic separation of the fuselage upper lobe and made startling headlines like, \u201cAnd Then, Whoosh! She was Gone\u201d (Wright & Tanji, 1988). The accompanying photos showed evidence of what might have been considered impossible in the past. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) noted that the probable cause of the accident was \u201cthe failure of the Aloha Airlines maintenance program to detect the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage which ultimately led to\u2026the separation of the fuselage upper lobe\u201d (NTSB, 1989, p. v). Almost a year later, on March 10, 1989, Air Ontario accident in Dryden, Canada, also revealed a number of systemic factors, including maintenance failures (Commission of Inquiry, 1992a). On June 10, 1990, a British Airways BAC 1-11 experienced explosive decompression when the captain\u2019s window blew out (King, 1992). These three accidents resulted in both an intense focus on maintenance-related accidents as well as a unique, multiparty collaboration between the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Transport Canada (TC), and the United Kingdom\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA), as well as partnerships across airlines, maintenance repair and overhaul facilities, and universities.",

            "text": "Early efforts to assess safety-related issues in maintenance and develop appropriate intervention programs relied heavily on the success of the cockpit resource management (CRM) program among the flight crew during the decade of the 1980s, which was focused on crew communication and teamwork. Thus, the early maintenance resource management (MRM) programs, which were essentially CRM principles applied to the maintenance environment, also focused on communication and teamwork among the maintenance personnel (Fotos, 1991, Taggart, 1990). Pre/post training evaluation tools developed by Gregorich, Helmreich, and Wilhelm (1990) were modified from CRM to MRM to suit the audience while maintaining their psychometric integrity and applied to the assessment of MRM programs (Taylor, Robertson, Peck, & Stelly, 1993). Similarly, much of the style and content of the MRM training intervention was borrowed from the successful CRM programs as studied by Helmreich, Foushee, Benson, and Russini (1986).",

            "text": "Concurrent with the emerging research in MRM, three other major accidents drew attention to safety in maintenance operations: June 1995 Valujet accident in Atlanta, Georgia; August 1995 Atlantic Southeast Airlines accident in Carrollton, Georgia; and 1996 Valujet accident in Miami, Florida. Reviews of these three accident cases, along with the knowledge from previous accidents and effects of early MRM training interventions resulted in improved understanding of the maintenance environment, resulted in the beginning of a shift from individual-level blame to system-level responsibility, and led to both conceptual as well as psychometric separation of MRM from CRM. For example, in 1994, Gordon Dupont from TC identified twelve overarching issues in aviation maintenance, which were later known as the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d: lack of communication, complacency, lack of knowledge, distraction, lack of teamwork, fatigue, lack of resources, pressure, lack of assertiveness, stress, lack of awareness, and norms (CAA, 2002, p. 20). Concurrently, Dr. James Taylor from Santa Clara University built a robust survey instrument to study the pre/post effects of MRM training programs (Taylor, 1998, Taylor, 2000a). Through such efforts of various scientists and practitioners, MRM matured beyond a CRM application to the maintenance environment and a clear definition of MRM emerged: MRM is \u201c\u2026 an interactive [emphasis added] process focused upon improving the opportunity for the maintenance technician to perform work more safely and effectively\u201d (ATA, 2002, p. 5).",

Safety nets associated with each of these elements were also discussed.2.\nAccident case analysis: One or more exercises were designed to illustrate how a chain of events (at times each event is a minor deviance) can lead to disastrous consequences.\n3.\nOrganization-specific problem: Focus was placed on a particular problem that the organization wants to rectify immediately. Examples of such problems include shift turnovers, logbook errors, ground damage, or lost-time injuries.4.\nInteractive exercises: Typically, the training also included at least one interactive exercise to illustrate concepts such as the value of teamwork or hazards of verbal turnovers.\n",

Concurrently, the aviation industry also suffered a number of serious public health, security, and economic challenges like the Asian economic crisis of 1997, terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the US financial crisis of 2007\u201308, and the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic of 2009. These challenges had substantial impact on MRM programs: the initial efforts to build and sustain MRM programs had to be redesigned, updated, and regrouped into different other programs in order to cope with the decline in available resources, as well as retirements or transfers of many committed champions of the MRM programs. Awareness of these external factors provides valuable insight into the need to stay true to the core value of safety in the aviation industry and to remain resilient to external challenges.",

Enthusiasm for this program was higher than for the previous case\u2014nearly 90% of the participants said there would be at least a moderate change in their on-the-job behavior (Taylor & Robertson, 1995, p. 15). Over a 26-month period, the program participants reported a gradual improvement in attitude toward change and moved from passive practices (like being a better listener) to active practices (like will not hesitate to speak up) (Taylor and Christensen, 1998, Taylor and Robertson, 1995, Robertson et al., 1995). During the same time frame, lost-time injuries and ground damage incidents decreased (Taylor & Robertson, 1995). Thus, there were three levels of improvements: enthusiasm about the training content, individual attitude toward safety, and safety outcomes. Unfortunately, even this program did not continue past the initial 26-month run and it had to be put on hold as the management\u2019s attention shifted toward economic priorities such as station closures and cost-cutting; soon the excellent results of their MRM program began to reverse (Taylor & Christensen, 1998, pp. 128\u2013129).",

Although only 450 personnel (about 300 technicians) were reported to have completed this training, 80% of them reported that they expected moderate to large changes in their behavior as a result of the MRM training (Taylor, Robertson, & Choi, 1997). With respect to behavioral changes, 40% committed to active behavioral changes as a result of the MRM training and about 45% committed to passive behavioral changes. Furthermore, there was even stronger (compared to the previous case) improvement in lost-time injuries and ground damage incidents. Thus, this case also proved that MRM programs can be effective in improving attitudes, behaviors, and performance outcomes. More importantly, the frontline personnel are more responsive to the training as evidenced in the higher level of improvement in performance outcomes. Again, this program did not continue past the initial phase due to resource constraints.",

The content of this program was differentiated from the first generation programs in two ways: (1) it emphasized behavioral change rather than just an attitudinal change that was emphasized in the first generation programs and (2) it included company-specific cases from maintenance and was directed at maintenance technicians rather than managers and/or engineers. Additionally, there was a strategic differentiation: this program was built on an informal agreement between the company, the FAA, and the maintenance technicians\u2019 union. The agreement was that the union would encourage their members to participate in the training program and be forthcoming in their errors so that the company could focus on systemic issues and implement changes that would minimize the opportunity for similar errors in the future. In exchange for such cooperation from the union, the company promised to address the broad systemic issues rather than just individual-level corporate disciplinary action (assuming the error was inadvertent) and the FAA Flight Standards District Office also adopted a broader, collaborative stand recognizing that individual-level disciplinary actions were not effective in long-term improvements in safety. Moreover, all the parties recognized the importance of engaging the erring technician in the safety conversation in order to minimize recurrence of similar errors. The agreement between the FAA, company, and the union was built on the trust among the three individuals (John Goglia, Joe Kania, and Jim Ballough) representing the three parties and their respective credibility among their affiliate groups. This critical risk taken by the three individuals and the subsequent success of the second generation MRM programs was foundational to the modern-day Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and the Safety Management System (SMS) Program.",

Examples of such recommendations included formal training in documentation for all maintenance technicians. The result of this training was immediate and the errors decreased, but it did not last long (Taylor and Christensen, 1998, Taylor, 1995). The second-order changes included more structured efforts, but in the form of a control group and an experimental group. As part of the MRM training, the experimental group/station received specific content (awareness, role-playing, group exercises, and tutorials) on how to reduce documentation errors. All other stations formed the control group. The experimental group\u2019s errors declined and stayed lower than the control group (Taylor, 1994, Taylor, 1995).",

In this report, the Honorable Commissioner Moshansky took a very broad, systemic stand on the investigation and noted several limitations of the aviation system that allowed the accident to occur. This philosophical shift\u2014from individual blame to systemic responsibility\u2014and review of the specific role of air carrier management, practical recommendations for the airline, the regulator, and the global aviation industry laid the foundation for broader systemic changes across the global aviation industry. Similar to the value of Dr. Drury\u2019s testimony in the case of the Aloha Airlines accident, in the case of the Air Ontario accident, Dr. Robert Helmreich was invited to review the investigative data and make his recommendation. Dr. Helmreich, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, was funded by the NASA Ames Research Center to conduct this study. Based on his study, Dr. Helmreich claimed the following:The results of this analysis suggest that the concatenation of multiple factors from each category allowed the crew to decide to take off with contaminated wings. According to this view, no single factor taken in isolation would have triggered the crew\u2019s behaviour prior to and during take-off, but in combination they provided an environment in which a serious procedural error could occur. This array of contributory influences without a single, proximal cause warrants classification of the accident as a system failure.Commission of Inquiry (1992b, Appendix 7, p. 322)\n",

Although the HPIM program was developed for the Canadian audience, and the first two generation of MRM programs were a mix of awareness and behavior programs, thereafter, the majority of the North American MRM programs developed during 1994\u201398 focused on awareness and individual coping. For example, in 1996 a major US airline developed its MRM program to create an awareness of the impact of human performance on maintenance-related errors and personal safety. The Dirty Dozen were thoroughly integrated in this program. This program was developed by a team of technicians, supervisors, and the company\u2019s training department. Thus, it had broad support and had good instructional design. As a result of this training, over 60% of the participants said there would be a moderate or large change in their on-the-job behavior (Taylor & Christensen, 1998), which is substantially lower than that claimed by the first generation MRM programs. In terms of behavioral intentions, about 46% of the participants committed to passive changes and 27% committed to active changes. This outcome is also substantially different from that reported in the third case of first generation MRM programs. Given that the training focused on awareness rather than behavior, such intentions were not surprising. On the other hand, statistically significant improvements were found in attitudes about sharing responsibility, communication, and stress management immediately following the training sessions, and they remained stable for several months after the training (Taylor & Christensen, 1998, pp. 154\u2013155).",

This airline worked with its union and the local FAA to develop the MRM training program based on the Canadian HPIM model, but decided to split it into two days that were separated by several months. The separation of the training days enabled the trainers to introduce the various topics on the first day, allow the participants to return to work and reflect on the training content, and return to the training topics for a more applied approach on the second day, when the emphasis was on how to manage errors through practiced assertiveness and awareness of risk factors. Thus, this approach seemed to be a bridge between the behavioral focus of the first two generations and the purely awareness-level focus of the third generation MRM programs. Most of this training was accomplished in one city during 1998 and in another city in 1999. In 1998, the likelihood for voluntary change increased from 60% to about 65% from phase 1 to phase 2 of the training program, while in 1999, the likelihood for such a change increased from 69% to 85%. Similarly, attitude and opinion changes after the two training days/phases showed significant improvement. However, in 1998, field interviews several months after phase 2 of the training revealed that the safety standards and MRM program implementation were deteriorating due to lack of management follow-through. The intentions to change at both cities were largely passive (between 44% and 61%), while the active change responses ranged between 8% and 14%. With respect to performance changes, both cities showed a significant decline in ground damage incidents following the start of the MRM program and the decline continued for about 16 months after the second phase of the training. (Taylor and Robertson, 1995, Taylor et al., 1997). Again, the third generation MRM programs showed an improvement in participant attitudes, commitment to change their behaviors (mostly passive behaviors, but some active behaviors as well), and a sustained improvement in performance outcomes. Thus, by all measures these training programs were successful. Nonetheless, they lacked continued support and follow-through from management (Taylor, 1998) and they remained focused on improving awareness and passive influence over behaviors (Taylor & Patankar, 2001). They also did not have clear safety performance goals, rapid feedback of results, and appropriate reinforcement for those who demonstrated the desired safety behaviors.",

While these programs continued to build upon the best practices from previous generations, like including the Dirty Dozen topics and incorporating role-playing and interactive exercises, they started incorporating cases involving internal maintenance error investigations. The management and the technicians knew from previous experience and research findings that employee\u2013management trust was low and improved transparency with data-sharing and open communication would help strengthen the employee\u2013management trust. Also, one critical investigative lesson learned through the Aloha Airlines accident, the Air Ontario Accident, and the BAC 1-11 accident was that the underlying systemic causes of human errors must be investigated thoroughly in order to develop meaningful, comprehensive preventive solutions for the future. Thus, the fourth generation programs included specific tools for human factors investigations of maintenance errors, thereby translating the awareness of elements like the Dirty Dozen into practical, actionable tools (Allen and Marx, 1994, FAA, 1997). However, the fundamental challenge of interpersonal trust between technicians and managers, as well as between technicians and the local FAA inspectors continued to challenge the continuation of MRM programs. As a result, the efforts to advance MRM program development and implementation kept returning to the notion that technicians, management, and the FAA must uphold their commitment to certain fundamental tenets: focus on systemic issues rather than individual blame; implement nonpunitive error-reporting system; and follow-through on their commitments. It was known from previous studies that the technicians did not tend to trust others very easily because they tend to be more individualistic (Taylor and Patankar, 1999, Taylor, 1999) and self-reliant (Taylor & Christensen, 1998). Thus, the fourth generation programs not only addressed individual awareness and behavioral issues, but also gradually shifted toward seeking a deeper, cultural change (Taylor & Patankar, 2001).",

            "text": "\nTaylor and Patankar (2001) presented two cases that illustrate the transition of the fourth generation MRM programs toward cultural change. In the first case, the emphasis was on individual behavior, regardless of the attitudinal readiness. This approach was quite the opposite of previous attempts to seek attitudinal change first and hope for a behavioral change to follow. In this case, certain behaviors were expected from the maintenance, flight, management, and dispatch personnel. Their emphasis was on a structured communication protocol, called the Concept Alignment Process (Lynch, 1996, Patankar and Taylor, 1999), which was specifically designed to expect procedural compliance, integration of risk analysis in tactical decision-making, vigilance and safeguard against individual complacency, and question another team member\u2019s decision in a safe and respectful environment (Lynch, 1996). The key to the success of this program was a reinforcement cycle: prescribed behavior led to procedural changes for flight, maintenance, as well as management; these procedural changes were supported and implemented; the participants\u2019 acceptance of the new communication protocol increased and their attitude toward the protocol improved; and improved attitude led to improved adoption and more consistent adherence to the prescribed behavioral protocol, which led to further organizational changes (Patankar & Taylor, 1999). One of the key performance outcomes of this program was that it not only resulted in changes to internal organizational procedures, but it also impacted the FAA\u2019s approved procedures and manufacturer\u2019s service bulletins. While the internal impact was not surprising, the external impact brought to light the potential for a broader influence of MRM programs.",

This program was representative of the state-of-the-art at that time. It utilized the available training materials and past practice in terms of the Dirty Dozen topics and the associated case examples, but it also incorporated behavioral aspects such as the Concept Alignment Process and known tools and techniques associated with the investigation of human error in maintenance. Additional information available through the FAA, NASA, and other public domain web sites was also made available. Thus, the expectation was that the participants would continue to build their awareness after the training and practice their behavioral skills taught in the course. Furthermore, the company was also better prepared to act on the systemic improvement ideas that might arise from the training participants. The company management was open to making the necessary changes and keeping everyone informed of the changes as well as rationale for adopting or not adopting the suggested changes.",

As a result, most companies in the United States suspended their MRM programs. In 2003, the FAA funded a different type of project. Instead of continuing to fund research related to traditional MRM programs, they funded a project related the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) in maintenance. This change in research focus was consistent with the internal shift the airline industry had made\u2014it had shifted from the traditional CRM/MRM programs to ASAP programs, which were consistent with the core concept over which MRM programs were built. As presented in the discussion about the second generation MRM programs, the core concept was that three parties\u2014company, labor, and regulator\u2014need to come together and focus on systemic improvement rather than individual blame. Also, by that time, there was sufficient awareness regarding the human factors principles and so the MRM training could focus on event investigation and classification of human error. Thus, the fifth generation MRM programs were in fact, Maintenance ASAP programs, which continued to use the basic MRM concepts (like the Dirty Dozen and case studies), but focused more on the integration of human factors in event investigation methods. However, since the adoption of ASAP programs was much slower in the maintenance community (in 2003, there were only six programs in maintenance; whereas, there were 28 programs in flight), the FAA was interested in learning about the barriers to adoption, particularly if the barriers were related to the FAA\u2019s ASAP policy (FAA, 1997, FAA, 2002).",

Since the advisory circular pertaining to Maintenance ASAPs used language similar to the flight domain, it was hypothesized that it would be difficult to apply the same circular in the maintenance domain. Patankar and Driscoll (2005) conducted an extensive field study and reported eight best practices across successful Maintenance ASAP programs; of those, five are presented here:1.Use the template MOU provided by the FAA, but create an addendum to provide maintenance-specific details about the specific program: The original template MOU was based on the needs of the flight crew. It was incredibly difficult to create an entirely new MOU for maintenance; thus, it was recommended that the maintenance community try to accept the flight MOU and add a separate document to provide details about the maintenance ASAP program.2.Try to keep an open mind and accept as many ASAP reports as possible: In the beginning, the Maintenance ASAP program suffered from the same interpersonal trust issues as those discovered during the early generation MRM programs. Since the intent of the Maintenance ASAP program was to provide a nonpunitive pathway to report errors and implement systemic solutions, it was recommended that the ASAP program\u2019s Event Review Committee (ERC) accept as many reports as possible.3.Consider a report as \u201csole source\u201d if it is from anyone within the company: In the early stages of the Maintenance ASAP program, there was much debate about what would be considered a \u201csole source\u201d report because if it was not a sole source report, it could be subject to company and/or FAA action. To simplify matters, the recommendation from the industry was to consider all reports from within the company to be sole source reports.4.Try to link ASAP reports from different professional communities to leverage the overall benefits: In some companies, there were separate ASAP programs and ERCs for each professional community\u2014flight, maintenance, and dispatch. While there were several reasons to keep these reports and programs separate, the industry also noted potential to link the reports so that comprehensive solutions could be developed.5.Follow through on labor, management, and FAA commitments: Since an ASAP program is a tripartite agreement, all three members must honor their commitments, regardless of the political pressures or cost of the corrective actions. Thus, the industry strongly advocated for consistent commitment from all parties.\n",

Taylor (2004) focused on this issue and reported on his findings regarding acceptance criteria for maintenance ASAP events. Taylor noted that for the maintenance community, the notion of \u201cintentional disregard for safety\u201d was a difficult concept to define, but could be approached with a risk-based philosophy of error management, and decisions could be made on a case-by-case basis. Taylor concluded that the regulators, union representatives, and air carrier representatives responded similarly to the accept/reject decision with respect to the ASAP cases provided to them. Thus, the community standard approach could be used in Maintenance ASAP programs to detect intentional disregard for safety, without having to explicitly define it.",

So, members from American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, AAR Corporation, United Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, International Association of Machinists (IAM), Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), FAA, NASA Ames Research Center, and Saint Louis University started organizing and holding separate Maintenance InfoShare meetings. Until about 2008, these meetings were held separately, but thereafter, there was sufficient momentum and interest that they could be integrated in the national InfoShare meetings, along with flight and dispatch communities. Today, these meetings are robust and are attended by over 1000 participants from a variety of professional communities (flight, maintenance, dispatch, cabin, regional airlines, universities, etc.) and there is a broader exchange of lessons learned and informal consultation with the FAA representatives.",

Thus, toward the end of 2008, the maintenance community\u2019s attention turned toward the line oriented safety audit (LOSA) program that had been operational in the flight community since the 1990s (Klinect et al., 1999, Klinect et al., 2003). The LOSA name was changed to Line Operations Safety Assessment (rather than Audit) to make it more consistent with the nonpunitive intent of the program (Ma & Rankin, 2012). It was based on a strong theoretical model of Threat and Error Management (Klinect et al. 1999), and it had proven to be successful in improving safety in the United States as well as abroad (ICAO, 2002). Ma et al. (2011) reported the early rationale for the exploration of LOSA programs in maintenance as follows:1.Implementation of a LOSA program in Maintenance and Ramp operations would enable proactive identification of threats and errors before they lead to an incident or accident, thereby reducing ground damage and personal injuries.2.Early success with Maintenance and Ramp LOSA programs demonstrates their ability to not only reduce ground damage (decline in ground damage attributable to human error ranged from 43% to 73%), but also their ability to improve efficiencies and reduce potential for human error by simplifying procedures like the lock-out and tag-out procedure for B767 leading edge devices at one of the partner air carriers.3.Improved communication and coordination of safety expectations with airport officials and external contractors working on air carrier aircraft.\n",

Thus, the assumption is that if one increases the vigilance regarding routine threats and errors, the operator(s) will be able to stop the error trajectory from manifesting itself in harm (this is the proactive aspect of this approach), and if the operator(s) is mindful of the systemic causes for such errors, he/she could enhance the safety even further by implementing systemic solutions (this is the predictive aspect of this approach).2.The data from LOSA observations are collected anonymously and are maintained entirely within the organization; therefore, there is no need for an approval from the FAA/regulator.

            "text": "As presented earlier in this chapter, the 1988 Aloha Airlines accident was the first airliner accident publicly acknowledged as one caused by maintenance errors. Recognizing that much of the transport aircraft fleet across the nation was aging, and similar challenges could be lying dormant at other companies, in June 1989, Dr. William Shepherd, from the Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences Division of the FAA, called the first meeting on human factors issues in aircraft maintenance and inspection (Shepherd & Parker, 1989). The objective of this meeting was to identify key human factors issues that impact maintenance and inspection actions, and Dr. Shepherd sought to both raise the awareness of the conditions under which an aircraft maintenance technician performs his/her job, as well as to identify research efforts necessary to improve safety in aviation maintenance and, if necessary, make appropriate recommendations for regulatory changes. The recommendations arising out of this initial meeting could be categorized as follows:1.Modernize technical training: It was widely recognized that the extant technical training and performance requirements in the FAA Part 147 curriculum are inadequate for the modern aircraft technology that is in use. The participants recommended a thorough review and rewrite of the regulatory requirements so that both technical requirements as well as instructional technologies could be enhanced. It was also noted that the supply of trained aircraft maintenance technicians was inadequate to meet the future demand; therefore, enhanced marketing efforts were recommended.2.Add soft skills training: The need for supplementing technical training with soft skills focused on the need for training in interpersonal communication and management of stress and time pressures in the work environment.3.Create means for ongoing research on aviation MHF: There was a need for ongoing research in aviation MHF ranging from task analysis of actual technician and inspector jobs to improvement in maintenance instruction and data as reported in various technical publications and manuals. Also, the participants expressed the need for a centralized database of industry information concerning maintenance technologies, procedures, and problems.\n",

Thus, in response to the above recommendations and overwhelming support from the aviation maintenance industry, the Human Factors in Maintenance Research Program was born, and it was housed under the Office of Aviation Medicine. Ms. Jean Watson was appointed the Program Manager. From then on, the FAA followed a structured process of engaging the aviation maintenance industry in identifying research requirements, identifying and selecting appropriate researchers (both academic and nonacademic), leveraging resources from other federal agencies, and disseminating results through annual conferences, published reports and proceedings, as well as journal articles, books, book chapters, software, website archives, and videos. Today, most of the training materials and research reports are available at the following site: https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/maintenance_hf/.",

            "text": "Just months before Dr. Shepherd organized the first Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection meeting, in March 1989, Air Ontario\u2019s Fokker F28 crashed in Dryden, Ontario, Canada. The subsequent investigation resulted in almost 200 recommendations, including those related to aviation MHF. Thus, Transport Canada (TC) was also highly motivated to develop stronger awareness regarding human factors in aviation maintenance. The year 1990 onward, representatives from TC started to participate in the FAA\u2019s Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection meetings. In 1993, TC hired Gordon Dupont to develop their HPIM training program and released the program in 1994 (as previously discussed in Section 13.1.3 under Third Generation MRM Programs). Almost concurrent with this development in Canada, and triggered by the 1990 BAC 1-11 accident in the United Kingdom, the UK CAA's interest in MHF also began to grow. The participation of representatives from both TC and the UK CAA, as well as airlines and maintenance organizations from Canada and Europe continued throughout the 1990s. Ultimately, the FAA, TC, and the UK CAA decided to take turns hosting the meetings. The first international meeting was in fact the Twelfth Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection Symposium, which was hosted by the UK CAA in 1998 and held at Gatwick Airport. In 1999, the 13th symposium was in Daytona Beach, FL; in 2000, the 14th symposium was in Vancouver, BC; in 2001, the 15th symposium was in London, UK; in 2002, the 16th symposium was in San Francisco, CA; and in 2003, the 17th (and final) symposium was in Toronto, ON.",

            "text": "There are numerous outcomes that could be linked with this series of seventeen symposia that lasted for 14 years. Some of the key outcomes are as follows:1.Built the legitimacy of Maintenance Human Factors (MHF): Through numerous funded research projects, many serious academics from a variety of universities, as well as the NASA Ames Research Center, were drawn to research opportunities. They developed a substantive scholarly body of knowledge and built the foundation upon which text books and training materials could be developed. The applied nature of research in this field enabled the industry partners to fully participate in the research studies and not only appreciate the value of academic research, but also strengthen it by providing practical guidance and validation. Thus, the research outcomes had both practical significance as well as substantive contributions to the advancement of the state of knowledge in the field of MHF. Additionally, two of the most critical appointments that could be directly attributed to the success of the MHF program were as follows:a.In 1995, Mr. John Goglia was appointed to the Board of the NTSB and he served till 2004. He was the first aircraft mechanic to ever serve on the NTSB Board and throughout his term, he was the most effective champion of human factors in maintenance.b.In 2002, Mr. James \u201cJim\u201d Ballough, an early believer in human factors created the position of the Chief Scientist and Technical Advisor for Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance with the FAA. He selected Dr. William \u201cBill\u201d Johnson for that position and brought MHF on equal footing with flight deck human factors and other technical disciplines.\n2.Created foundational materials and ready-to-use products for training: The FAA, TC, and the UK CAA used results of research projects and industry best practices derived from various generations of implementation to develop foundational materials such as the PEAR Model, the SHEL(L) Model, Reason\u2019s Swiss Cheese Model, the Dirty Dozen, and various role-playing exercises, case studies, and videos that are commonly used in MHF courses across the western world. Such widespread shared use led to the development of a common body of knowledge, including shared understanding of terminology such as fatigue, sleep deprivation, closed-loop communication, and safety nets. The impact and dissemination of research results is demonstrated by the depth and breadth of outcomes posted on the following websites:a.Most of the FAA-funded research products, including reports, tools, and training materials are available at https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/maintenance_hf/\nb.Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., which was recently acquired by Taylor & Francis, has built up a niche in aviation human factors and published a number of seminal works. Their catalog of current publications is available at https://www.routledge.com\nc.TC\u2019s publications and videos are available at http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/menu.htm\nd.The UK CAA has published guidance material to help approved maintenance organizations comply with the EASA Part-145 requirements. This document is available at http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP716.PDF\n\n3.Contributed toward regulatory guidance materials and requirements: The various MRM programs implemented at the participating airlines and repair stations achieved numerous changes to maintenance tasks, organizational procedures (like maintenance manuals updates), and industry-wide best practices (like nonpunitive error-reporting policies). At the national and international levels, the reports and recommendations from various research projects and conversations at the symposia contributed toward the development of the following legislative changes:a.Canadian Aviation Regulations, Subpart 7: SMSs. In 1999, TC began its journey toward system-wide implementation of SMS programs by first developing an overall framework for the entire Canadian aviation industry. It was published as, Flight 2005: A Civil Aviation Safety Framework for Canada (Transport Canada, 1999). Canada became the first country in the world to regulate the implementation of SMS in the aviation industry, but took a phased approach to building awareness through guidance materials and progressive phase-in requirements across all the industry sectors (flight operations, maintenance, design, airports, etc.). Subsequently, in Flight 2010, TC increased the emphasis on risk-based decision-making (Transport Canada, 2006). Today, Subpart 7 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations delineates the general requirements of SMS programs at all approved, certificate-holding organizations. Advisory Circular 107-001 provides guidance regarding development and maintenance of a Safety Management Program at large or complex organizations (Transport Canada, 2015).b.International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In 1986, the ICAO Assembly adopted Resolution A26-9 regarding flight safety and human factors, and the Air Navigation Commission formulated the subsequent objectives. Among those objectives was the development of training materials to raise awareness regarding how human factors issues impact safety in every aspect of the aviation industry\u2014design, operation, navigation, air traffic control, and maintenance. ICAO began with the publication of a series of Human Factors Digests (earliest guidance material on Human Factors in Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection dates back to 1995, Circular 253), but subsequently integrated their content into a two-part training manual: Human Factors Training Manual, Doc 9683-AN/950 (ICAO, 1998). With respect to the handling of MRM in this Manual, the following topics were included: contemporary maintenance problems; human errors in maintenance; organizational perspective on human errors in the maintenance and inspection environment; illustration of various cases of maintenance errors; human factors issues such as interpersonal communication and shift turnovers; variations in technical training methodologies and tools; teamwork and organizational factors; and job design. In 2003, ICAO published the Human Factors Guidelines for Aircraft Maintenance Manual (ICAO, 2003). Many of the outcomes from the Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection Research Program were incorporated in this document: general background on human factors in aviation maintenance; key issues in maintenance error; countermeasures to maintenance errors; skills training in shift turnover/handover, task turnover/handover, and planning and recording of nonscheduled maintenance; environmental factors impacting maintenance actions and errors; ergonomic audit programs; document design for aircraft maintenance; and fatigue management. In 2008, ICAO published amendments to Annex 6, which included the requirement for all operators of international general aviation operations with certificated maximum take-off weight exceeding 5700 kg or those equipped with turbojet engines, to establish and maintain a SMS (ICAO, 2008, section 3.3.2), In February 2013, ICAO developed the new Annex 19, dedicated to safety management, and adopted it in November 2013\u2014this annex provides comprehensive guidance on SMS implementation requirements and timelines for both operators and regulators (ICAO, 2013).\nc.European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and UK CAA. EASA incorporated the human factors training requirements under Joint Airworthiness Requirements (JAR) Part-145. The deadline to comply with this requirement was July 1, 2005 and for alternate means of compliance, the deadline was September 28, 2006 (CAA, 2003, Chapter 11, p. 1). All approved maintenance organizations were expected to have in place a process for initial and recurrent human factors training. The guidance material, with respect to interpretation and compliance with the JAR-145 requirements, from UK CAA (CAA, 2003) began with the discussion of safety culture and organizational factors leading to maintenance errors; thereafter, it continued with focus on error management, individual-level human factors issues such as fatigue, environmental factors, maintenance procedures and documentation, communication, planning, professionalism, event reporting systems, and concluded with human factors training for maintenance professionals.d.FAA. While ICAO, TC, EASA, and UK CAA took the compliance-based approach to implementation of MRM and SMS programs, the FAA took a voluntary approach to MRM and SMS adoption and produced numerous materials that could be used for awareness training. The FAA also updated its Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook (General) by adding Chapter 14 on Human Factors (FAA, 2008), and further revised it in 2011. In recent years, the FAA has committed to comply with the ICAO requirements and is making efforts to make the appropriate regulatory changes (FAA, 2016). For example, in 2015, the FAA issued the final rule requiring all air carriers operating under Part 121 to develop and implement an SMS program; it also indicated that a similar requirement might be extended to Part-145 operators (approved repair stations) through the corresponding Part 121 air carriers. The requirements for human factors training are not specifically listed in the final rule, but under Subpart E (Safety Promotion), it is expected that the workforce will \u201cattain and maintain the competencies necessary to perform their duties relevant to the operation and performance of the SMS\u201d (FAA, 2015, \u00a75.91, p. 1328). Also, according to the latest Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the implementation of SMS programs at certificated airports, the requirement for an SMS program will only apply to small, medium, or large hub airports\u2014the comments in response to this NPRM are under review (FAA, 2016). Thus, the US aviation industry is on a good path to sustainable implementation and continuous improvement of MRM and SMS programs.\n\n",

With respect to the MRM programs, the participants seemed to be very motivated to learn and transfer (as indicated by the posttraining attitudinal scores), but the organizational climate for transfer of training was not always conducive to realize the full potential of the MRM training (as evidenced by the interview data that claimed lack of management follow-through). Thus, future implementation of MRM programs might benefit from Sitzman and Weinhardt\u2019s (2015) training engagement theory, which advocates for continuous assessment of engagement and commitment from multiple levels of the organization so that there is an ongoing attention to the training and multilevel vested interest in the training program\u2019s success.",

The significance of interpersonal trust began to emerge in fourth generation MRM programs and grew stronger in the fifth and sixth generation programs. In the early stages (fourth generation), the realization of the significance of interpersonal trust was limited to co-workers and employee\u2013management relationship. As the MRM programs continued to mature through the fifth generation, the notion of interpersonal trust became foundational to the sustainability of MRM programs, and in the sixth generation programs, the level of trust expected from co-workers, managers, regulators, and industry-wide colleagues has set a new high standard without which incorporation of programs like ASAP and LOSA, and predictive analytics available due to sharing of safety data, would be impossible.",

Those who were more inclined to value group harmony or community goals over individual autonomy were classified as \u201ccollectivistic,\u201d and those that valued individual autonomy over group or community harmony were classified as \u201cindividualistic.\u201d Hofstede noted that the individualistic versus collectivistic differentiation mapped very well across national boundaries\u2014people from western countries were more individualistic than those from eastern or South American countries. This study laid the foundation for classification of cultures based on national boundaries. Helmreich and Merritt (1998) called such differentiation \u201cnational culture\u201d and built on the underlying concepts across professional and organizational boundaries to define \u201cprofessional culture\u201d and \u201corganizational culture.\u201d Helmreich and Merritt applied Hofstede\u2019s individualistic versus collectivistic measure to airline pilots and surgeons and discovered that the surgeons were more individualistic than Hofstede\u2019s original sample of IBM workers and that the pilots were more individualistic than the surgeons. When Taylor (1999) conducted a similar study of aircraft maintenance technicians, he discovered that the technicians were more individualistic than pilots. Thus, on the continuum of individualism-through-collectivism, aircraft maintenance technicians tend to be the most individualistic, which is quite the opposite of the goals of MRM programs. Therefore, in order for MRM programs to be effective in improving interpersonal communication and teamwork, they must place greater emphasis on behavior modeling and skills training. In terms of cross-national implications, subsequent studies (Patankar and Taylor, 2001, Patankar, 1999, Taylor and Patankar, 1999) have noted that while the North American MRM training transitions well to Asian audiences, the assertiveness scores increased more significantly in Taiwan and India. Therefore, a typical North American MRM training could be used in more collectivistic national cultures, but certain populations may respond differently to the modules related to assertiveness.",

            "text": "In the United States, the implementation of MRM training has been voluntary. Thus, most companies needed to demonstrate a positive return-on-investment in order to offer such programs and make them part of the broader safety strategy. The FAA has provided a basic return-on-investment calculator tool (FAA, 2017b). This tool provides a good way to generate an initial estimate of the ROI to be expected from an MRM program. However, while it accommodates for a less than 100% probability of success with the MRM program (training may not achieve 100% of its goals), it does not accommodate for other concurrent or recently completed safety initiatives that might influence the overall safety performance outcome. In order to objectively measure the financial impact of MRM training, while giving credit to non-MRM safety initiatives that might have been concurrently or previously supported, Taylor (2000b) presented a formula that distills the effects of MRM instruction for a realistic assessment of return-on-investment from MRM training alone. In this formula, a \u201ccausal operator\u201d is used as a multiplier (between 0 and 1) to appropriately right-size the estimated ROI. The actual value of this causal operator is based on the pre/post comparison of change in participant attitudes resulting from an MRM training program. Thus, if there was a 30% improvement in participant attitudes after the MRM training, the training program could take credit for only 30% of the total ROI. Patankar and Taylor (2004a) presented two examples to illustrate that substantial positive ROI is possible from expensive MRM programs that affect \u201chigh value\u201d outcomes (such as the lost-time injuries example). Also, at times, MRM programs may be successful at improving safety outcomes, but not result in a positive ROI. Therefore, it is important to plan and design one\u2019s MRM program to impact the specific targets and their associated ROI.",

At the next higher level, the analysis shifts to company-wide safety programs.

Although Lercel et al. did not report any mid-level examples from the aviation industry, they presented compelling examples from construction and pharmaceutical industries to illustrate both company-wide benefits of safety programs as well as risks of a safety-related failure. At the macro level of analysis, Lercel et al. illustrated the devastating effects of safety incidents (even those with a relatively benign or positively heroic outcome) on company stock prices\u2014essentially, companies could lose substantial market value as a result of a safety incident, regardless of the actual outcome (in terms of loss of life/property).",

One could argue that in the early years of MRM programs, the shared experience of aircraft maintenance engineers/technicians revolved around blame. Accident/incident investigations focused on \u201cwho\u201d made the mistake and the corrective actions were largely punitive to the individual responsible for the mistake. Thus, theoretically, if one had to change this blame-oriented culture in aviation maintenance, it was essential to create a different shared experience. While they may not have realized it at the time, the founders of the second generation MRM programs\u2014John Goglia, Jim Ballough, and Joe Kania\u2014knew from personal experience that the technician who made the mistake was most knowledgeable about the circumstances leading up to the mistake and therefore needed some degree of protection from disciplinary action so that he/she could help prevent similar errors in the future. As the second generation programs went through implementation and the three parties\u2014company, FAA, and the union\u2014demonstrated that they could uphold their mutual agreement, all three parties created a new shared experience. Over time, repeated and consistent emphasis on nonpunitive error management helped move the aviation maintenance community away from blame-oriented culture. However, it took almost a decade for this cultural shift to be institutionalized as a formal, replicable process: it came in the form of ASAP programs as part of the fifth generation MRM programs. Thus, today, the artifact that illustrates the shift from a blame culture to a reporting or just culture within a particular organization is the ASAP agreement between labor, management, and the regulator. The claim that such cultural shift is a national phenomenon is supported by the rise in Maintenance ASAP programs from 6 to 168 from 2003 to 2017.",

The resultant accident investigations also played a critical role in shifting the mindset from individual-level blame to system-level responsibility. Thus, when MRM programs were created and implemented, they offered an alternate shared experience to the maintenance personnel, management, and regulators. As each party learned from the new experience and held steadfast on their mutual commitment, the old assumptions melted away, interpersonal trust improved, shared values changed, and workplace performance outcomes improved. Both internal and external leaders (people who held formal positions) and influencers (people who did not hold direct operational responsibilities) played their part in shaping the interventions, providing objective feedback from the success and challenges in implementing the interventions, and developing reports and training materials. Holistically, an intricate web of social systems, comprising of individuals, corporations, labor unions, universities, and government agencies, achieved a fundamental shift in shared values across the global aviation industry. This is not to say that the process was flawless or the experience was without challenges and setbacks; nonetheless, people persevered, adapted to the changing fiscal, geopolitical, and regulatory constraints, and in some cases passed on the responsibilities to their successors to continue the core pursuit.",

Once the MEDA tool was developed, field-tested, and ready for broad distribution, the Boeing Company started providing the tool and the accompanying training on how to use it to all its customer airlines. Thus, the tool as well as the basic concepts of human factors in maintenance, nonpunitive reporting systems, and emphasis on systemic solutions were promulgated across the international air carrier community.",

By setting the trigger on an \u201cevent\u201d rather than an accident or incident, the MEDA process encouraged review of all undesirable outcomes. Also, it allowed the operators to track events that were important to them. Examples of such events included flight cancellation, gate return, and inflight engine shut-down. All the events were associated with actual cost incurred by the air carrier (although the cost varied by company), and therefore the process encouraged the users to consider financial implications of both the errors as well as the solutions. In the decision phase, the operator is expected to determine whether or not the event was maintenance-related; only if it was maintenance-related, the operator would use the MEDA process further to conduct the investigation. The predeveloped MEDA form guided the investigators in determining the underlying causes of the event and enabled them to determine whether the event occurred due to an error or a violation. According to MEDA, an error is an unintentional human error and a violation is an intentional human action; maintenance-related events can be caused by either errors, violations, or a combination of the two. MEDA also allowed the investigators to consider appropriate prevention strategies. Finally, the feedback phase was intended to communicate back to the workforce the nature of the event, results of the investigation, and strategies to be employed to prevent similar events in the future. As of 2007, Boeing claimed that over 500 of its customer organizations have used MEDA training, and the outcomes ranged from a 16% reduction in delays due to maintenance to 48% reduction in operationally significant events. Thus, MEDA has proven to be an effective tool to mitigate lower-level events and thereby reduce the risk of higher-consequence events (assuming that the contributing factors for both levels of consequences are similar or the same).",

One of the core principles of the HFACS-ME model is that accidents are a combination of latent conditions and active failures; thus, in order to develop long-term preventive measures, one should address the latent conditions. Latent conditions and active failures are classified into four broad categories: unsafe management conditions, unsafe maintainer conditions, unsafe working conditions, and unsafe acts of the maintainer. As a result of this approach, it is likely that any given investigation will reveal latent conditions that could contribute to other undesirable events in the future. Schmidt et al. (2001) analyzed 15 NTSB accident reports and discovered that 100% of them reported unsafe management conditions, 73% reported unsafe maintainer conditions, 67% reported unsafe working conditions, and with respect to unsafe maintainer acts, 87% reported errors (unintentional human error) and 47% reported violations (intentional risky or illegal actions).",

In the case of technical operations, maintenance personnel had experienced a blame-oriented culture wherein it was common for error investigations to focus on the person who might have committed the error rather than addressing latent issues in the system. Thus, the maintenance community had learned to not speak up or maintain their personal notes on how to prevent errors. However, certain key leaders knew that in order to address the challenge of maintenance errors, they needed to earn the trust of their maintenance personnel and engage them in solving the system problems. Therefore, when John Goglia, Joe Kania, and Jim Ballough decided to work together to address this issue, they took the foundational step toward changing the shared experiences of maintenance personnel and thereby setting in motion the long journey toward a sustainable cultural change in aviation maintenance. At that time, a deeper, underlying assumption in the maintenance community was that if the technician was forthright in admitting his/her mistake, he/she would be subject to not only corporate disciplinary action, but also to a certificate action by the FAA. Thus, it was essential for both the company and the FAA to provide the technician with consistent protection while not making the protection serve like a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card (full amnesty). This approach was also foundational to today\u2019s notion of a just culture, wherein there is a clear separation between inadvertent errors and intentional disregard for safety; the latter is punishable. Reflecting on how the culture in technical operations matured over the six generations of MRM programs, it is clear that the shared experience of the technicians, managers, and the regulators must have changed, which eventually led to the development of formal tripartite agreements among company, union and the FAA. Once these agreements started to be formalized and supported, the subsequent shared experiences served to reinforce the shared organizational values regarding safety, nonpunitive reporting, and just culture.",

Violation of any one of these behaviors constituted negligent behavior and hence the individual did not receive amnesty, bringing about a balance between accountability and benevolence (Patankar and Baines, 2003).

As noted in the preceding sections, the various generations of MRM programs have aimed at both improving awareness and changing individual behavior. While some programs had specific behavioral change goals directed at addressing problems like documentation errors, others simply assumed that a change in awareness would translate into change in behaviors and ultimately into change in performance outcomes such as reduction in ground damage or lost-time injuries. For the most part, however, the planned aspect of the program was limited to individual-level awareness or individual-level change in behavior. Furthermore, most programs were successful in achieving passive behavioral changes suggested by their increased self-awareness regarding human performance issues, but not active changes in the sense that the participants were not overtly committed to doing anything different such as implementing mitigation measures to counter fatigue, distractions, stress, etc. In the future, interventions involving training programs could consider comprehensive models of training evaluation like Alvarez et al.\u2019s (2004) integrated model of training evaluation and training effectiveness as well as Spitzer\u2019s (2005) Learning Effectiveness Measurement (LEM) methodology, which take a more active stance on transfer of learning into workplace behaviors and incorporate the role of extant organizational culture. Such an approach would not only make MRM-like training interventions more effective in achieving their outcomes, but also enable the managers (frontline through senior management) to be better prepared to support the organizational changes emanating from the implementation of the training intervention.",

Over the years, both these conditions changed: the MRM training became more independent of CRM training and the InfoShare meetings had strong representation from the maintenance community.

In the case of MRM programs, three catastrophic maintenance-related accidents (Aloha Airlines, Air Ontario, and British Airways BAC 1-11) served as the defining moments or trigger events. In response to these events, there was a flurry of responses. First, there was an organized series of symposia to gather industry-wide input in determining the nature of the work environment and general challenges like aging aircraft, workforce development, and human fallibility. Almost concurrent with these symposia the previously successful CRM training was adapted to the maintenance environment and the first generation of MRM training program was launched. Over the years, both the series of industry symposia and the MRM training programs evolved through six generations, they survived multiple economic challenges, and adapted to meet the emerging regulatory and economic needs.
