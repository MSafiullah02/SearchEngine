The volunteers participating in our study had a mean age of 36 years, which excludes the possibility that the humoral immunity acquired could have been related to historical exposure to the influenza A virus, as was the case with those born before 1957.12 We also reject the hypothesis that immunity is related to prior vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, as its cross-reactivity with pandemic virus is almost non-existent.13 The high seroprevalence observed is coherent with the fact that these healthcare workers did not present a higher incidence of cases of influenza A despite their presumably greater exposure, as a result of their work, because although they were more exposed, the proportion of protected subjects would also have been higher.",
