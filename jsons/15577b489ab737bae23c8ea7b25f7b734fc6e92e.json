Yet IgA remains inadequately understood, at least with respect to its biological functions. In part this reflects its molecular heterogeneity as well as its occurrence in two distinct physiological compartments: the systemic circulation and the mucosal secretions. As detailed in Chapter 1 of this volume, IgA in humans and the anthropoid apes occurs in two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) as well as in monomeric, polymeric (dimeric and higher), and secretory forms. Secretory IgA (SIgA) predominates in mucosal secretions, where its activities in the protection of these surfaces against colonization and invasion by pathogens and against injurious toxins are relatively well understood. However, the functions of circulating \"serum\" IgA remain poorly understood. Despite the metabolic cost involved in synthesizing IgA, which implies that there should be a significant physiological benefit derived from producing it, IgA is also the most readily dispensable isotype, as revealed by IgA deficiency. This is the most common form of primary immunodeficiency occurring in up to 1:400 individuals of Caucasian origin (although less frequently in other populations); yet, affected individuals are usually not severely immunocompromized (Chapter 13). Consideration of all these facts reveals that much about IgA remains perplexing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 59, "end": 78, "text": "(Deza et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Nevertheless, specific IgA antibodies, particularly in mucosal secretions, have been documented to provide significant protection against a variety of toxins, viruses, bacteria, and protozoa in both humans and experimental animal models (Tables 6.1 and 6.2) (reviewed in Russell and Kilian, 2005) (see Chapters 7 and 8). Conventional concepts of SIgA neutralizing toxins and enzymes, inhibiting the adherence of microorganisms to mucosal surfaces, and facilitating their clearance in the mucus layer remain essentially valid. SIgA is well adapted to mucosal protection, because its abundant carbohydrate chains render it hydrophilic and negatively charged. In addition, the secretory component (SC) of SIgA has been shown to protect it from proteolysis ( Crottet and Corth\u00e9sy, 1998) , thereby prolonging its survival within enzymatically hostile environments such as the intestinal tract. This is consistent with models showing SC folded around the juxtaposed Fc domains of two IgA monomers that are held together partly by the J-chain polypeptide (Royle et al., 2003) , based on computerized predictions derived from other Ig structures and solution studies (Chapter 1). However, a crystallographic model of SIgA, or even of its Fc 2 .J.SC segment, is not yet available to confirm this.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 296, "text": "Russell and Kilian, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 753, "end": 782, "text": "( Crottet and Corth\u00e9sy, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1068, "text": "(Royle et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In considering the biological functions of IgA, one should keep in mind that IgA is the most heterogeneous of immunoglobulins, occurring in several molecular forms, subclasses, allotypes, and probably glycoforms, although Fernandez et al. (2003) in polarized mouse epithelial cells the latter have been little explored. These patterns of heterogeneity also differ between species, implying that its functions might differ in subtle ways also. Most notably, humans along with our close relatives, the great apes, have evolved a novel subclass, IgA1, which has an extended proline-rich and O-glycosylated hinge region (Chapter 1). IgA1 circulates in human blood plasma at a relatively high concentration (2-3mg/mL) and in predominantly monomeric form. In contrast, most other eutherian mammals that have been investigated possess only one IgA isotype that is structurally more akin to IgA2 and that is predominantly dimeric and circulates at concentrations around 0.2 mg/mL, similar to the concentration of human IgA2. Quite what the physiological significance of this difference between humans and other mammals represents is uncertain, but the implication is that the \"extra\" abundance of monomeric (m) IgA1 fulfills an additional function that remains largely unknown. Steady-state concentrations of Igs in plasma, however, give a misleading impression, because they do not take into account the half-lives of the different isotypes. Whereas IgG has an average circulating half-life of \u223c21 days, that of IgA1 is 5.9 days and that of IgA2 is 4.5 days (Morell et al., 1973) . These authors estimated the synthetic rate of plasma IgA1 as 24 mg/ kg/day and that of IgA2 as 4.3 mg/kg/day, whereas for IgG it was \u223c30 mg/kg/ day. Given that IgG consists of four subclasses, it is therefore probable that IgA1 is the most abundantly produced circulating Ig isotype in humans! Antibody specificities for proteins and polysaccharides have been reported to be differently distributed between the subclasses, such that antibodies to carbohydrates are often preferentially expressed as IgA2; however, the distinction is not absolute (Mestecky and Russell, 1986) . Otherwise, few clear functional differences have emerged, as both isotypes bind SC and are represented in SIgA and both bind the IgA Fc receptor on myeloid cells equally. A major difference is that IgA1, but not IgA2, is susceptible to cleavage by bacterial IgA1 proteases (see Sect. 6.2.4), but as these enzymes thereby disrupt its structure and function, the advantage of possessing IgA1 is difficult to grasp and it seems more likely that pathogens have exploited this weakness in human IgA1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 245, "text": "Fernandez et al.

Different glycoforms arise from the differential occurrence of N-glycosylation sites between subclasses and allotypes, as well as the presence of O-linked glycans in the hinge region of IgA1 (Mattu et al., 1998) . In addition, structural analysis of the N-linked glycans in myeloma proteins has revealed considerable sequence variation, which might also occur in normal IgA (Endo et al., 1994) . Because glycans can interact with lectinlike receptors and modulate interactions with Fc receptors and complement components, it is likely that subtle variations in glycosylation affect the functional properties of IgA in ways that have yet to be examined in detail. A particular example, however, is that defective glycosylation of IgA1 might be responsible for IgA nephropathy (Chapter 13).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 231, "text": "(Chintalacharuvu et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 425, "end": 445, "text": "(Mattu et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 608, "end": 627, "text": "(Endo et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Heterogeneity of IgA in Relation to Function"}, {"text": "Some other mammals also possess multiple IgA subclasses.

As discussed in Section 6.2.3.2, pIgA is better able to cross-link Fc\u03b1 receptors on phagocytes and might therefore be advantageous in protection against infection. Otherwise, the functional significance of this, and the maturation of the response toward mIgA, is uncertain. Other studies have revealed that individual IgA-secreting cells first produce pIgA and later mIgA (Moldoveanu et al., 1984) . The long-term production of circulating IgA is probably due to plasma cells in bone marrow, which mainly secrete mIgA1 (Hijmans, 1987 Just as it has become clear that colonizing microorganisms, whether pathogenic or commensal, must adhere to host tissue surfaces, so also has it been recognized that an important function of antibody-mediated defense of the mucosae is the inhibition of microbial adherence. It can readily be envisaged that any isotype of antibody having specificity for microbial adherence epitopes would inhibit their interactions with host receptors. However, SIgA is particularly well suited to this role because of its extensive glycosylation (accounting for 20% by weight), which confers hydrophilicity and negative charge on the molecule. SC, which contains 22% carbohydrate, contributes much of this property to SIgA. The macromolecular bulk of SIgA (400 kDa for dimeric forms) might also be important. Comparative studies of IgG, serum mIgA or pIgA, and SIgA antibodies of the same specificity for antigen have revealed the superiority of the latter in inhibiting adherence of different organisms to host surfaces (Hajishengallis et al., 1992; Phalipon et al., 2002) (see Chapter 8). Even if SIgA antibodies are not specific for adhesin antigens or epitopes, covering the surface of a microbe with a hydrophilic shell might be able to repel attachment of microbes to the surface. Agglutination of microbes is facilitated by the multiple valency (4 in the case of dimers) of SIgA, and this might promote their removal in the mucus stream.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 241, "text": "Russell et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 616, "end": 641, "text": "(Moldoveanu et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 763, "end": 777, "text": "(Hijmans, 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1813, "text": "(Hajishengallis et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1836, "text": "Phalipon et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Heterogeneity of IgA in Relation to Function"}, {"text": "The carbohydrate residues on SIgA might also enable it to inhibit adherence of microorganisms independently of its antibody activity, by binding to carbohydrate-specific adhesins on bacteria. For example, certain strains of Escherichia coli possessing mannose-specific type 1 pili can be agglutinated especially by IgA2, which carries mannose-rich glycans, and, as a result, inhibited from adherence to epithelial cells (Wold et al., 1990) . In some cases it might be necessary for sialic acid or other terminal residues to be removed to expose the interactive sugar residues (Royle et al., 2003) . However, the extent to which these interactions function in vivo to inhibit adherence, or conversely to promote it depending on the size of aggregates formed, has been debated (Friman et al., 1996; Liljemark et al., 1979 ). An interesting if controversial example is represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has been proposed to exploit its ability to bind SC to enhance epithelial cell invasion by inducing retrograde reuptake of SC (Brock et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 439, "text": "(Wold et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 576, "end": 596, "text": "(Royle et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 775, "end": 796, "text": "(Friman et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 797, "end": 819, "text": "Liljemark et al., 1979", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1059, "text": "(Brock et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1079, "text": "Zhang et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Heterogeneity of IgA in Relation to Function"}, {"text": "An old concept for the biological function of SIgA at mucosal surfaces is that SIgA is arrayed on the surface of the mucus layer to form a kind of immunological \"flypaper,\" allowing entrapped microbes to be swept along with the mucus flow. As appealing as this idea might be, supporting experimental evidence is only tentative. Interactions of SIgA with mucins, possibly involving the mucinlike hinge region of IgA1, or even the formation of disulfide bonds have been proposed (Clamp, 1977) , but other more recent studies indicate that SIgA diffuses freely through mucus (Saltzman et al., 1994) . Coating of microorganisms with SIgA antibodies reduces their hydrophobicity and facilitates their entrapment in mucus (Edebo et al., 1985; Magnusson and Stjernstr\u00f6m, 1982; Phalipon et al., 1995) . SIgA is associated with highmolecular-weight fractions of saliva that also contain mucins, and binding of SIgA to mucin MG2 has been described (Biesbrock et al., 1991) . Interestingly, when spermatozoa are coated with SIgA, their ability to penetrate cervical mucus is impaired, but treatment with IgA1 protease to remove the Fc and SC regions restores this ability (Bronson et al., 1987) . It is likely that cross-linked complexes formed by polyvalent SIgA interfere with sperm mobility, but this is alleviated when IgA1 protease cleaves SIgA1 to monovalent Fab fragments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 490, "text": "(Clamp, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 572, "end": 595, "text": "(Saltzman et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 716, "end": 736, "text": "(Edebo et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 737, "end": 769, "text": "Magnusson and Stjernstr\u00f6m, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 770, "end": 792, "text": "Phalipon et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 938, "end": 962, "text": "(Biesbrock et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1183, "text": "(Bronson et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interaction with Mucus"}, {"text": "Numerous examples of enzyme and toxin neutralization by SIgA antibodies have been described, including cholera and other enterotoxins (Johnson et al., 1995; Lycke et al., 1987; Stubbe et al., 2000) , bacterial neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, or chondroitin sulfatase (Fukui et al., 1973) , the glycosyltransferases of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, which are involved in dental caries development (Smith et al., 1985) , and bacterial IgA1 proteases ( Reinholdt and Kilian, 1995) . In some instances, it has been demonstrated that pIgA antibodies, or divalent F(ab') 2 fragments of IgA, are more effective than equivalent mIgA or IgG antibodies (Johnson et al., 1995; Norrby-Teglund et al., 2000) . This implies that neutralization involves more than simply the blockade of substrate binding or induction of a conformational change that affects enzyme or toxic activity, because this would be independent of isotype, the presence of the Fc region, or molecular conformation. In contrast, the monovalent Fab fragments of IgA1 antibodies to bacterial IgA1 proteases retain inhibitory activity (Gilbert et al., 1983) . Secretory IgA antibodies have been well documented to neutralize a wide variety of viruses. Although in many instances this might be due to inhibition of the binding and uptake of virus by cell receptors, viral replication can be inhibited in various ways, including inhibition of viral uncoating and other intracellular replicative processes depending on the epitope specificity, isotype, and concentration of antibody and the virus and cells involved (Armstrong and Dimmock, 1992; Castilla et al., 1997; Liew et al., 1984) . Again, pIgA and SIgA antibodies might be more effective than mIgA-for example, in inhibition of hemagglutination by influenza virus (Renegar et al., 1998) . However, pIgA antibodies to gp340 that neutralize the infectivity of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for B-cells (via complement receptor CR2) promote infection of colonic carcinoma cells via pIgR, at least in unpolarized cells in vitro (Sixbey and Yao, 1992) . On the other hand, polarized epithelial cells transport pIgA-complexed EBV from the basal to the apical surface without becoming infected by the virus, both in vitro and in vivo (Gan et al., 1997) . Likewise, IgA antibodies to gp120 might neutralize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of T-cells (Burnett et al., 1994) , whereas IgA antibodies enhance HIV infection of Fc\u03b1R-expressing monocytes Kozlowski et al., 1995) . SIgA or plasma IgA from HIV-1-exposed but uninfected individuals is especially effective in inhibiting the uptake and transcytosis of HIV-1 in epithelial cells (Devito et al., 2000) . SIgA antibodies to the ELDKWA epitope of gp41 have been shown to prevent epithelial cell uptake of HIV-1 (Alfsen et al., 2001; Matoba et al., 2004) . pIgA antibodies to gp41 can reexport virus to the apical surface of pIgR-expressing epithelial cells (Bomsel et al., 1998) , in a process resembling the removal of absorbed antigens (Kaetzel et al., 1991 ) (see Chapter 7). Furthermore, it is possible for viruses to be neutralized within epithelial cells by pIgA antibodies during their pIgR-mediated transcytosis (Mazanec et al., 1992) . For this to occur, vesicles containing replicating virus must interact with the vesicles that carry pIgA across the epithelial cells, and evidence of this has been obtained both in vitro and in vivo (Feng et al., 2002; Huang et al., 1997; Mazanec et al., 1995; Ruggeri et al., 1998; Yan et al., 2002 ) (see Chapter 7). In a similar way, the ability of Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate nuclear factor (NF-\u03baB) within epithelial cells can be inhibited by pIgA antibody during its pIgR-mediated transcellular transport (Fernandez et al., 2003) . The extent to which these mechanisms operate under natural conditions will depend on the presence of IgA antibody-secreting cells of appropriate specificity in the lamina propria adjacent to the site of the viral invasion or LPS uptake. Moreover, as pIgA is transported largely through cells in intestinal crypts, it might not encounter viruses or LPS entering through M-cells or the villi.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 156, "text": "(Johnson et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 157, "end": 176, "text": "Lycke et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 177, "end": 197, "text": "Stubbe et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 265, "end": 285, "text": "(Fukui et al., 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 413, "end": 433, "text": "(Smith et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 465, "end": 494, "text": "( Reinholdt and Kilian, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 660, "end": 682, "text": "(Johnson et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 683, "end": 711, "text": "Norrby-Teglund et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1128, "text": "(Gilbert et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1613, "text": "(Armstrong and Dimmock, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1636, "text": "Castilla et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1655, "text": "Liew et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1812, "text": "(Renegar et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2067, "text": "(Sixbey and Yao, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2266, "text": "(Gan et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2398, "text": "(Burnett et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2475, "end": 2498, "text": "Kozlowski et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2682, "text": "(Devito et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2811, "text": "(Alfsen et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2812, "end": 2832, "text": "Matoba et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2957, "text": "(Bomsel et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3017, "end": 3038, "text": "(Kaetzel et al., 1991", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3199, "end": 3221, "text": "(Mazanec et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 3423, "end": 3442, "text": "(Feng et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3443, "end": 3462, "text": "Huang et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3463, "end": 3484, "text": "Mazanec et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 3485, "end": 3506, "text": "Ruggeri et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 3507, "end": 3523, "text": "Yan et al., 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 3752, "end": 3776, "text": "(Fernandez et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neutralization of Toxins, Enzymes, and Viruses"}, {"text": "Uptake of food antigens in the intestine can be inhibited by SIgA antibodies previously developed in response to them (Walker et al., 1972) .

The classic example of a SIgA antibody interacting with complement and lysozyme to lyse E. coli (Adinolfi et al., 1966) unfortunately proved difficult to reproduce, and it is now thought that undetected contaminants were responsible for the observed effect. The bacteriostatic synergy of lactoferrin and SIgA antibodies (Stephens et al., 1980; Funakoshi et al., 1982) is possibly due to antibodymediated inhibition of alternative mechanisms of iron acquisition; covalent complexes between lactoferrin and SIgA have been reported (Watanabe et al., 1984) .

It is accepted that IgA does not activate the classical complement pathway (CCP), as IgA molecules do not contain a C1q-binding motif. Statements commonly found in many texts that IgA activates the alternative complement pathway (ACP), however, should be examined by reference to the primary literature and careful consideration of the conditions under which the experiments were performed. Numerous reports describe activation of the ACP by heat-aggregated, chemically cross-linked, or denatured human serum IgA, colostral SIgA, or myeloma proteins or by artificial recombinant IgA antibody constructs produced in transfected cell lines and complexed to haptenated antigen (Boackle et al., 1974; G\u00f6tze and M\u00fcller-Eberhard, 1971; Hiemstra et al., 1988; Valim and Lachmann, 1991) . In contrast, human monoclonal and polyclonal IgA antibodies physiologically complexed with antigen do not activate the ACP (Colten and Bienenstock, 1974; Imai et al., 1988; R\u00f6mer et al., 1980; Russell and Mansa, 1989) . However, the same IgA antibodies might activate the ACP when bound to a hydrophobic surface, chemically cross-linked or deglycosylated (Nikolova et al., 1994a; Russell and Mansa, 1989; Zhang and Lachmann, 1994) . Interestingly, ACP activation by aggregated IgA depends on the Fc (or Fc.SC) region instead of Fab, which is responsible for ACP activation by IgG (Nikolova et al., 1994a) . In heat-aggregated mixtures of human IgG and IgA, C3b fixation by the ACP depends on the proportion of IgG, and C3b becomes covalently coupled to the IgG component (Waldo and Cochran, 1989) . Mouse, rat, or rabbit IgA antihapten antibodies complexed with haptenated proteins activate the ACP (Pfaffenbach et al., 1982; Rits et al., 1988; Schneiderman et al., 1990) . However, comparison of mouse monoclonal antibodies of different isotypes in studies of complementmediated solubilization of immune complexes showed that whereas IgM and IgG complexes fix C4 and C3, IgA complexes do not (Stewart et al., 1990) . Several factors might contribute to all of these conflicting results. IgA purified by procedures involving exposure to denaturing conditions might be conformationally altered. Recombinant IgA proteins produced in hybridoma or transfectoma cells are often abnormally or incompletely glycosylated. Moreover, heavily haptenated proteins themselves can activate the ACP. Nevertheless, it remains possible that differences in amino acid sequence as well as glycosylation between human and animal IgA result in subtle but important functional differences, including their ability to activate the ACP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 490, "text": "(Adinolfi et al., 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 691, "end": 714, "text": "(Stephens et al., 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 715, "end": 738, "text": "Funakoshi et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 900, "end": 923, "text": "(Watanabe et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1126, "text": "(Tenovuo et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1282, "text": "(Hirano et al., 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1401, "text": "Russell and Kilian, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2100, "text": "(Boackle et al., 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2133, "text": "G\u00f6tze and M\u00fcller-Eberhard, 1971;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2156, "text": "Hiemstra et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2182, "text": "Valim and Lachmann, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 2308, "end": 2338, "text": "(Colten and Bienenstock, 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2339, "end": 2357, "text": "Imai et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2377, "text": "R\u00f6mer et al., 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2402, "text": "Russell and Mansa, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2564, "text": "(Nikolova et al., 1994a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2589, "text": "Russell and Mansa, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2615, "text": "Zhang and Lachmann, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2789, "text": "(Nikolova et al., 1994a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2956, "end": 2981, "text": "(Waldo and Cochran, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3110, "text": "(Pfaffenbach et al., 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 3111, "end": 3129, "text": "Rits et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 3130, "end": 3156, "text": "Schneiderman et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 3378, "end": 3400, "text": "(Stewart et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interaction with Innate Defense Factors"}, {"text": "Numerous studies have shown that IgA antibodies can effectively interfere with complement activation mediated by other antibody isotypes.

However, some findings remain to be explained, and it is possible that significant differences exist between IgA from humans and other species. In addition, it has been well demonstrated that denatured, conformationally altered, deglycosylated, or chemically modified IgA can activate the ACP. Whether equivalent changes can occur in IgA due to abnormal synthesis or even microbial attack and thereby initiate activation of complement and consequent pathological lesions is an interesting speculation.

Interactions of IgA with various cell types. Human cells of the myeloid lineage (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages) express Fc\u03b1RI (CD89) through which they can be activated by serum IgA, especially in polymeric form or when aggregated or complexed with antigen. Binding of SIgA (at least by neutrophils) requires Mac-1 as a coreceptor. Expression of Fc\u03b1RI varies according to the cell type, its state of differentiation or activation, and location. Signal transduction and hence cellular responses depend on association of Fc\u03b1RI with FcR\u03b3 chain. Eosinophils bind and respond especially well to SIgA (or SC), but the nature of the receptor is not clear. Basophils are also reported to degranulate in response to SIgA. Fc\u03b1/\u00b5R occurs on T-and B-lymphocytes, but its physiological function remains uncertain. The interaction of IgA with NK cells mighty be mediated by lectinlike receptors for carbohydrate determinants. DCs variably express Fc\u03b1RI or another receptor for IgA, but their response to IgA is controversial. Epithelial cells, including hepatocytes of certain nonprimate animal species, express pIgR, which binds pIgA and thereby transports it to the apical surface where it is released as SIgA. Antigens complexed to pIgA antibodies can be similarly transported by hepatocytes into bile or by intestinal epithelial cells into the gut lumen. pIgA antibodies might also be able to interfere with intracellular viral replication or inhibit responses to LPS within epithelial cells. Enterocytes and M-cells are also reported to bind IgA by other, possibly lectinlike, receptors. Serum IgA is catabolized by hepatocytes, probably after uptake mediated by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. For further details, see text. Reproduced with permission from Russell and Kilian (2005) , \u00a9 Elsevier Inc. However, it is now known that a receptor for the Fc of IgA, Fc\u03b1R (CD89), is expressed on myeloid cells and can mediate phagocytosis and other cellular responses to complexed IgA (reviewed in Monteiro and van de Winkel, 2003) (see Chapter 4). The level of expression of Fc\u03b1R varies between cell types and their activation state. For example, Fc\u03b1R is upregulated on gingival exudative neutrophils (Fanger et al., 1983; Yuan et al., 2000) but is absent from macrophages isolated from the gut mucosa (Smith et al., 2001) . Several activating agents such as phorbol esters, bacterial LPS, or even IgA itself, as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-8, and granulocyte monocytecolony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhance the surface expression of Fc\u03b1R on neutrophils, whereas interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 downregulate it (Gessl et al., 1994; Hostoffer et al., 1994; Maliszewski et al., 1985; Nikolova and Russell, 1995; Reterink et al., 1996; Weisbart et al., 1988; Shen et al., 1994) . pIgA is more effective than mIgA in cross-linking Fc\u03b1R (Stewart et al., 1994) ; indeed, plasma mIgA concentrations are sufficient to saturate Fc\u03b1R, but in the absence of cross-linking, the cells are not triggered. Association of Fc\u03b1R with the common FcR\u03b3 chain is necessary for signal transduction ( Honorio-Fran\u00e7a et al., 2001; Van Egmond et al., 1999) , but its expression varies between different cell types, their state of activation or differentiation, and location (Hamre et al., 2003) . In the absence of the signaling FcR\u03b3 chain, IgA might be taken up and recycled without inducing inflammatory responses (Launay et al., 1999) . Binding of SIgA appears to require Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) as an accessory receptor (Van Spriel et al., 2002) . Thus, numerous factors are involved in determining whether myeloid cells respond to IgA. It is remarkable that mice lack a CD89 homologue, implying that differences exist in the physiological functions of IgA in mice and humans. However, it has been found that galectin-3 can substitute as an IgA receptor, at least in mediating IgA antibody-dependent protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a mouse model (Reljic et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1783, "end": 1808, "text": "Russell and Kilian (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2051, "text": "Monteiro and van de Winkel, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2243, "text": "(Fanger et al., 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2262, "text": "Yuan et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2343, "text": "(Smith et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 2689, "end": 2709, "text": "(Gessl et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2733, "text": "Hostoffer et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2759, "text": "Maliszewski et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 2760, "end": 2787, "text": "Nikolova and Russell, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 2788, "end": 2810, "text": "Reterink et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2833, "text": "Weisbart et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2852, "text": "Shen et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 2910, "end": 2932, "text": "(Stewart et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 3153, "end": 3183, "text": "( Honorio-Fran\u00e7a et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3184, "end": 3208, "text": "Van Egmond et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 3326, "end": 3346, "text": "(Hamre et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3468, "end": 3489, "text": "(Launay et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 3571, "end": 3596, "text": "(Van Spriel et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 4014, "end": 4035, "text": "(Reljic et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neutrophils and Macrophages"}, {"text": "Several studies have reported that polyclonal human serum IgA or monoclonal IgA antibodies can promote phagocytic uptake and killing of bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis by human neutrophils in vitro (Janoff et al., 1999; Van der Pol et al., 2000; Vidarsson et al., 2001) .

The finding that certain animal species, among them rats, mice, and rabbits, have pIgR expressed on hepatocytes that can therefore transport pIgA directly from the blood into bile led to the demonstration that pIgA antibodies can mediate elimination of bound antigens from the circulation by hepatobiliary transport (Peppard et al., 1981; Socken et al., 1981) . This has been proposed as a means of noninflammatory disposal of complex microbial antigens that cannot be broken down in mammalian tissues, or of food antigens absorbed in the intestine Russell et al., 1983) . However, as human hepatocytes do not express pIgR, this process does not occur in humans (Tomana et al., 1988) . Nevertheless, other receptors, such as the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which mediates the uptake of desialylated glycoproteins for catabolism by the liver (Mestecky et al., 1991) , and possibly also membrane galactosyltransferase, might contribute to a functionally similar transport process on a smaller scale (Tomana et al., 1993) . A portion of desialylated IgA, together with any bound antigen, taken up by these receptors might become missorted into the biliary secretory pathway instead of the lysosomal degradative pathway (Schiff et al., 1984 (Schiff et al., , 1986 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 846, "end": 868, "text": "(Peppard et al., 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 869, "end": 889, "text": "Socken et al., 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1100, "text": "Russell et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1213, "text": "(Tomana et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1395, "text": "(Mestecky et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1549, "text": "(Tomana et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1767, "text": "(Schiff et al., 1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1790, "text": "(Schiff et al., , 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 61, "text": "(Fig. 6.1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"text": "One measure of the significance of IgA in protection of the mucosae in humans might be the frequency with which bacterial pathogens have developed countermeasures specific for human IgA. A classic example of this is IgA1 protease, which is expressed by numerous significant human mucosal pathogens but not by closely related nonpathogenic species (Table 6 .3). Other species of bacteria produce IgA-binding proteins that have been proposed to interfere with functional protective mechanisms exerted by IgA antibodies, although these are not well understood . Molecular characterization of the IgA1 proteases and their catalytic mechanisms has revealed three distinct classes of enzyme: serine proteases (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Ureaplasma), metalloproteases ( Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga), and cysteine proteases (Prevotella), as well as several different genetic origins (Table 6 .3). This means that the same unique enzymatic activity has evolved independently as many as five times in bacterial phylogeny. Yet, all IgA1 proteases show the same effect of cleaving human IgA1 specifically at one or other of the proline-serine or proline-threonine bonds in the hinge region, yielding Fab\u03b1 and Fc\u03b1 fragments, which are not further degraded by these enzymes. mIgA, pIgA, and SIgA forms are all susceptible to cleavage, and the Fab\u03b1 fragments retain antigen-binding activity (Mansa and Kilian, 1986) . Apart from the homologous IgA1 proteins of other anthropoid apes (Cole and Hale, 1991; Qiu et al., 1996) , no other species of IgA, or human IgA2, is cleaved by these proteases. Investigation of the role of IgA1 proteases as virulence factors is hampered by this exquisite specificity, which precludes the use of conventional animal models. Moreover, many of the bacteria that produce them are exclusively human pathogens. However, indirect inferential evidence suggests that IgA1 proteases contribute to the virulence of the organisms that produce them. One hypothetical mechanism concerns the three species implicated in bacterial meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae, which all produce IgA1 proteases. IgA1 anticapsular antibodies, which might occur in primary infections of children as a result of prior exposure to cross-reacting antigens, are cleaved by IgA1 protease to Fab\u03b1 fragments, which facilitate instead of preventing invasion of the organisms. Moreover, these Fab\u03b1 fragments block access of other functionally intact antibodies of the same or different isotype. However, if the IgA1 protease elicits an inhibitory antibody response against itself concomitant with the induction of anticapsular IgA1 antibodies, then protection might be achieved. Several items of evidence lend indirect support to this hypothesis. The IgA1 proteases particularly of H. influenzae and to a lesser extent of N. meningitidis show extensive antigenic variation, which permits escape from antibody-mediated inhibition (Lomholt et al., 1995) . Fab\u03b1 fragments have been shown to be ineffective in inhibiting adherence, and to inhibit complement activation mediated by IgG antibodies (and resultant bacteriolysis) to the same antigen (Hajishengallis et al., 1992; Janoff et al., 2002; Jarvis and Griffiss, 1991; Reinholdt and Kilian, 1987; Tyler and Cole, 1998) . In addition, adherence of S. pneumoniae to epithelial cells is enhanced in the presence of IgA1 antibodies to capsular polysaccharide that have been cleaved by IgA1 protease (Weiser et al., 2003) . Analysis of virulence genes in S. pneumoniae has also revealed an association of the iga gene with pathogenicity in a mouse model, even though murine IgA is not susceptible to cleavage by IgA1 protease, suggesting the possibility of additional activities of IgA1 protease (Polissi et al., 1998) . However, it is possible that a paralogous \"iga\" gene was involved in the observed association ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1375, "end": 1399, "text": "(Mansa and Kilian, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1488, "text": "(Cole and Hale, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1506, "text": "Qiu et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2954, "end": 2976, "text": "(Lomholt et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 3167, "end": 3196, "text": "(Hajishengallis et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3197, "end": 3217, "text": "Janoff et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 3218, "end": 3244, "text": "Jarvis and Griffiss, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3245, "end": 3272, "text": "Reinholdt and Kilian, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 3273, "end": 3294, "text": "Tyler and Cole, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 3471, "end": 3492, "text": "(Weiser et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 3767, "end": 3789, "text": "(Polissi et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 347, "end": 355, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 874, "end": 882, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Counteraction of IgA by Bacterial IgA Proteases"}, {"text": "Immunoglobulin A has long been thought of as a benign form of antibody that lacks the dramatic functional activities commonly associated with other isotypes. Its relatively noninflammatory nature is undoubtedly important at mucosal surfaces where the immune system is continuously exposed to an abundance of microorganisms both pathogenic and harmless, as well as foreign macromolecules. IgA antibodies can form immune complexes with antigens without necessarily eliciting inflammatory reactions that can inflict collateral damage on the host tissues (Brandtzaeg and Tolo, 1977 ) (see Chapter 10). Yet, it has become clear that IgA can mediate potent responses in cells that possess receptors for it. Key to understanding the physiological role of IgA is the recognition that it is heterogeneous in structure, comprising monomeric, polymeric, and secretory forms, two subclasses (in humans), and possibly several glycoforms. Moreover, these variants are differentially distributed in two distinct compartments (the systemic circulation and mucosal secretions) and are produced with different temporal kinetics. In addition, the expression of cellular IgA receptors is subject to regulation. SIgA probably has little opportunity to interact with either complement or phagocytes at mucosal surfaces, because leukocytes quickly disintegrate in the hypotonic environment of most secretions and a fully functional complement system is not usually present. However, if the mucosal barrier is breached, microorganisms will become exposed to an environment dominated by submucosal pIgA secreted by resident plasma cells as well as SIgA. Infiltrating neutrophils expressing Fc\u03b1R will be capable of responding to IgA-opsonized organisms and thereby providing immune defense, but the IgA might also afford damage-limiting capability by regulating inflammatory responses. In this connection, it is noteworthy that inflammatory bowel diseases appear to involve increased IgG relative to IgA production in the affected tissues (Baklien et al., 1977) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 577, "text": "(Brandtzaeg and Tolo, 1977", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2035, "text": "(Baklien et al., 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IgA and Homeostasis"}, {"text": "Observations that preexisting mucosal antibody responses can interfere with the use of live bacterial or viral vectors for the delivery of mucosal vaccines (e.g., Attridge et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1999; Svennerholm et al., 1981) have suggested that SIgA antibody might regulate the initiation of the immune response. This has been demonstrated in infant mice suckled on immune foster mothers: The neonates' antibody responses to reovirus were suppressed by maternal milk antibodies (Kramer and Cebra, 1995) . It is likely that the low level of mucosal antibodies elicited by commensal bacteria prevents overstimulation of the immune system without actually eliminating harmless organisms that are desirable for host survival (Shroff et al., 1995) . IgA antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I have been reported to promote the survival of kidney allografts (Koka et al., 1993) , but the mechanism underlying this apparent suppression of immune responsiveness is not known.
