            "text": "Cough is a very common symptom that results in around 30 million healthcare visits each year in the USA [1]. Severity ranges from mild, all the way to severe excessive cough which can cause vomiting, urinary incontinence, and even rib fractures. The cough reflex serves a purpose, and that is to clear the airway from bacteria, debris, and secretions. The physiologic pathway that results in cough is rather complex. Humans have cough receptors in the respiratory tract, pericardium, diaphragm, pleura, esophagus, and stomach. There are chemical and mechanical receptors that respond to a variety of stimuli which results in an impulse that travels through the vagus nerve to the \u201ccough centre\u201d in the medulla. An efferent signal then travels down to the spinal motor nerves to the expiratory musculature, producing cough [2]. Despite serving a purpose physiologically, cough is an unpleasant symptom and proves to be the most common new complaint seen in primary care [3]. There are many possible causes for a troublesome cough. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) suggests that assessing the duration of symptoms is the most useful first step in assessing patients who present with cough. Based on duration, cough is classified as acute (<3 weeks), subacute (3\u20138 weeks), and chronic (>8 weeks). Duration of symptoms is key because acute, subacute, and chronic cough each has distinct etiologies [4]. Generally, patients with cough >3 weeks should be referred to their physician. Pharmacists play an important role in the assessment and management of patients with cough. They can identify patients who need urgent medical attention, those who are appropriate for self-care, and anyone in between. Cough assessment involves gathering a focused history from the patient, concentrating on clinical features, exposure history, presence or absence of red flags, and key patient-specific factors. Once the pharmacist has gathered the necessary information, he/she can move on to next steps such as prescribing an OTC medication or referral to the family physician or the emergency department.",

Cough often lingers after the other symptoms have resolved. This is called a postinfectious cough and is a common cause of subacute cough. Postinfectious cough is thought to be caused by a combination of postnasal drip and a direct sensitizing effect of the virus on airway receptors [5]. Both of these mechanisms fall under the umbrella of upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), which is discussed in the disease-related cough section. Table 5.1 shows the infectious syndromes that cause cough.",

For more severe exacerbations (marked breathlessness, impaired speech, accessory muscle use, or drowsiness), patients should use initial therapy with salbutamol as above and proceed to the ER urgently for assessment and management.

However, up to 40% of patients with cough due to reflux do not have any traditional GERD symptoms. It is thought that refluxed acid and stomach contents stimulate receptors in the upper and lower respiratory tract, leading to cough [19]. ACCP recommends empiric antireflux therapy for patients who have chronic cough and classic symptoms of GERD. If there is no other explanation for the cough after evaluation, a trial of antireflux therapy is also recommended for patients with chronic cough even if they do not have GERD symptoms [1]. Antireflux therapy should include lifestyle modification (weight loss if overweight, limiting fat intake, smoking cessation, etc.) as well as proton pump inhibitor use. Further options include metoclopramide and antireflux surgery [20].",

It has been described as a persistent dry cough, sometimes with a scratching or tingling sensation in the throat [22]. The incidence is anywhere from 5% to 35% of patients taking this class of medication. The exact mechanism of this adverse effect is unknown. Bradykinin and substance P likely play a role. These molecules are normally broken down by ACE, and thus build up in the presence of an ACE inhibitor. It has been proposed that bradykinin sensitizes airway sensory nerves, possibly through increasing prostaglandin levels [22, 23]. Onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough ranges from hours to months after initiation of therapy. After stopping the ACE inhibitor, resolution of cough usually occurs within 1\u20134 weeks but may take up to 3 or more months. Cessation of ACE inhibitor is recommended for all patients with chronic cough who are taking an ACE inhibitor [22]. Upon rechallenge, cough will recur in approximately 67% of patients. Rechallenge may be reasonable in patients with compelling indication for ACE inhibitor therapy [24]. Most patients can be switched to an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), as these agents have proven efficacy for many of the same indications, and are much less likely to cause cough [22].",

It is important to distinguish a productive (\u201cwet\u201d) cough from a nonproductive (\u201cdry\u201d) cough. For patients with a productive cough, antitussive medications should be avoided, as they can prolong and worsen their illness [25]. For these patients, an expectorant such as guaifenesin can be tried, which has a mechanism of action of loosening phlegm and helping to expel it. For patients with a nonproductive cough, an antitussive such as dextromethorphan can help lessen their coughing. Table 5.3 depicts the pharmacologic options for cough in adults. Cough and cold medications are not appropriate for over-the-counter use in children <6 years old, as per Health Canada guidelines. Serious adverse effects have occurred in young children. This warning includes first-generation antihistamines, antitussives, expectorants, and decongestants. Use of these medications in children must be in conjunction with a primary care provider [26]. For bacterial infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotics will likely be required. Choice of antibiotics depends on severity of illness, previous antibiotic exposure, etc. and is beyond the scope of this chapter. For patients with influenza, oseltamivir should be considered if symptom duration is <48 hours or for those at risk of complications from influenza. Oseltamivir may decrease symptom duration by 12 to 72 hours [27]. The seasonal influenza vaccine should also be given to most people for prevention of influenza.",

For example, formany patients who are appropriate for self-management, and who have trialed a cough medication, it would be prudent to follow up with them in the next 1\u20137 days. Efficacy-monitoring parameters would include frequency of cough, quality and quantity of sleep, and amount of sputum production. Safety monitoringparameters would include common side effects of whatever medication was chosen. For example, safety monitoring for codeine would include questioning for drowsiness or constipation. For dextromethorphan, one would need to ask about serotonin toxicities if the patient is taking any other serotonergic drugs.",
