The work must often be tactical, and what has been produced the day before often must be completely revised the day after because a new piece of information has arrived.

As the COVID-19 epidemic spread across China from Wuhan city in early 2020, it was vital to find out how to slow or stop it. We could not investigate the effectiveness of control measures in a controlled experiment or a clinical trial, and instead the epidemiology of COVID-19 has been punctuated by conspicuous superspreading events, in which an infected person transmits the virus to many more people than average. The average transmissibility of a pathogen is quantified by its basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is a bedrock concept in infectious disease dynamics. Yet biological, social and environmental factors -aided by a good dose of happenstancegive rise to significant individual variation around this average. This holds true for all pathogens to varying degrees, but evidence suggests that the emerging coronaviruses causing SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are systematically prone to superspreading 2,3 .",

Such individual variation makes transmission chains more likely to die out, and outbreaks rarer but more explosive, than if every case was an average transmitter 2 . This variation matters most when case numbers are small (early in the pandemic, or after successful outbreak suppression if the population remains susceptible), as countries try to prevent establishment of community transmission. Health officials must guard against complacency, recognizing that many importations will fade out by chance but a minority will ignite outbreaks that expand with shocking speed.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen with some key characteristics that many mathematical modellers were concerned could emerge together: quite high mortality and efficient transmission had to rely on statistical and mathematical modelling. However, precise evaluation of particular interventions requires substantial data or assumptions: not only accurate characterization of the epidemic process itself but also government actions and even human behaviours, such as the three billion trips taken over the Chinese New Year holiday. We therefore constructed models in con junction with a growing geocoded database on coronavirus epidemiology, human movement and public health interventions.",

On the basis of statistical tests of association carried out with general linear models, we found that the unprecedented Wuhan city travel ban (affecting 11 million people) slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 3 days 1 , delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. We found, too, that Chinese cities that pre-emptively implemented control measures -such as suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatheringsreported in the first week of their outbreaks one-third fewer cases than cities that started control later. Our second approach to analysis built these findings into a dynamic mathematical model, from which we calculated that China's national emergency response prevented hundreds of thousands of cases that we otherwise expected to see during the first 50 days of the epidemic. between people. As the virus has made its way around the world, transmission models are proving invaluable to the response effort. Some models aim to provide answers that public health decision-makers need in real time: how effective possible interventions are likely to be. Our group recently modelled a classical intervention against infectious diseases: contact tracing and isolation 4 , in which the contacts of known cases are found, and, if they show symptoms, are isolated quickly. Doing so therefore little information. For these parameters, we provided scenarios of a range of values, so that decision-makers could see the effect under different regimes, and so that if that information became available in the future, the model would still be informative.",

While firefighters in Australia were bringing the devastating 2019-2020 bushfires under control, a novel coronavirus was spreading rapidly through China, transitioning from a local outbreak into a global pandemic. Remarkably, the mathematical models scientists use to study the spreading of both fires and pathogens share many features. An important similarity is that in both cases, models and data show that the economic and health costs do not increase linearly with the number of people infected or hectares burned; instead, they explode, going from imperceptibly small to unimaginably large in what seems an instant. Herein lies the central challenge of studying such systems: both involve random, multiplicative processes characterized by exponential growth and discontinuous phase transitions, where the equilibrium number of cases can go from nearly zero to infinitely many in actually an instant. Accordingly, their mathematical properties depend on rare, exponentially costly and hard-to-study events.",

Whereas the effects of fires can often be seen with the naked eye, public health records contain information on only the largest outbreaks. As a result, although ecologists can study the past effects of numerous fires, both large and small, epidemiologists rely primarily on data from rare, population-spanning events. Why does this matter? At the phase transition, between local outbreak and global pandemic, the proportion infected can be scale free, meaning measuring only the large outbreaks leads to immeasurably large bias. Mathematical epidemiologists have developed models that can inform policy that saves lives, but the need remains for more refined instruments to gather empirical observations and test those models.",

Reported case counts are inevitably biased by the proportion of infections that are symptomatic, care-seeking behaviour and the availability of tests. Although these biases could be partially addressed by developing transmission models to analyse all available epidemiological and clinical data, a synergistic and complementary solution is to use seroepidemiological studies. These use measurements of antibody response across a population to infer infective exposure to (and, by extension, immunity against) the pandemic pathogen, and provide the most direct and reliable data for estimating true epidemic size. Integrating seroepidemiological data into transmission models can greatly reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of clinical severity and transmission dynamics. At the time of writing, serological tests for COVID-19 are being developed and validated. Long-term longitudinal sero logical follow-up of recovered individuals is crucial for characterizing the underlying immunodynamics. For instance, it can reveal the strength and duration of protective immunity and thus the probability of reinfection. As such, large-scale serosurveys should be conducted regularly and prospectively planned over the course of the different waves of the pandemic and beyond to provide serological data from different age groups.",
