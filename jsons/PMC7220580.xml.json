The 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea was the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside of the Middle East, resulting in 186 infected cases, 38 causalities, and 16,752 people being quarantined [2\u20134]. The characteristics and mechanisms of MERS transmission have been well investigated since the outbreak [5\u20137]. Specifically, MERS deaths in Korea can be attributed to the absence of effective vaccination and treatment for MERS, weak healthcare system for epidemic control, and ill-prepared hospitals with a deficiency in professional expertise, as well as negative pressure room for isolation of MERS patients [7\u201310]. Furthermore, increased incidences of nosocomial infection of MERS during the outbreak in 2015 elevated the fear, panic, and anger among the general public [11, 12].",

Also, the usage is even greater among those with a chronic condition and report poorer health status [16\u201319]. Thus, the use of CAM among infectious diseases patients has gained popularity over the past decades, and a growing body of literature highlights its use against the threat of new and emerging infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and H1N1 [20\u201326]. Furthermore, it is especially important to investigate the characteristics of CAM use in countries where the practice of traditional medicine is popular.",

In Korea, consumption of natural products such as a multivitamin, whole grain, and probiotics was popular during the MERS outbreak, which were the modalities that are widely used for the management and treatment of common cold and influenza-like illnesses [24]. Such similarities in modalities used support existing findings that people\u2019s decision to use particular CAM is influenced by specific physical symptoms experienced and self-assessed health care needs [45, 46]. Our findings also show differences in the use of self-administered modalities (multivitamin, nutritional supplements, food products, and exercise) and practitioner-administered modalities (massage, yoga, and traditional Korean medicine). Higher preference of self-administered CAM modalities in our study implies that in order to protect themselves from an outbreak event, people are more likely to rely on self-medication and minimize the risk of exposure. In fact, a high proportion of Koreans during the 2015 MERS outbreak avoided the crowded area and health facilities to prevent infection [2].",

Furthermore, similar to the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [50], the majority of respondents also reported the mass media as the main source of disease-related information during the MERS outbreak in Korea.

            "text": "Lastly, several factors were identified as potential predictors of CAM use during the MERS outbreak. As for sociodemographic characteristics, previous studies found female gender, younger age, and tertiary education level to be associated with CAM use among people with risk of disease development [54, 55]. However, on the contrary, only the higher age groups (being 40 to 49 years of age, being over 50 years of age) were more likely to use CAM in our study. This incongruency may be due to differences in the sample size of the study and characteristics of diseases, as in the case of infectious disease outbreaks, higher perceived vulnerability among elders could influence them to engage in health-promoting behaviors [14, 56]. In the case of health belief-related factors, those who used CAM prior to the outbreak and showed dissatisfaction with the government response to the outbreak were more likely to use CAM in the present study. Similarly, previous studies found distrust in the government and dissatisfaction with the conventional health care system to be associated with CAM use [16, 57]. These results suggest that individuals who find the formal health care system to be unreliable resort to CAM to compensate for the lack of perceived-health care quality, to practice autonomy, and to protect themselves from health threats [16, 57\u201359]. However, the findings remain inconclusive, and further research is needed to improve our understanding of the determinants of CAM use during epidemic events.",

In the era where emerging infectious diseases continue to be a major public health concern, the effective use of mass media and information and communication technology should be considered to achieve efficient delivery of health information and to promote behavior changes in situations of vulnerability. Therefore, public health authorities should build an integrated platform that provides proven and reliable information during public health emergencies to protect the health of citizens.",
