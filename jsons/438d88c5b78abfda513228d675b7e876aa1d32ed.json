            "text": "Background: Phishing URLs are critical security threats to internet users. They serve as weapons to perpetrate cyberattacks such as phishing, scam and drive-by-download attacks. These attacks cause inevitable losses to businesses and their users. Recently, Machine Learning Phishing URL classification (MLPU) systems have gained tremendous popularity to detect phishing URLs proactively. However, the security vulnerabilities of MLPUs remain mostly unknown. Aim: To address this concern, we conducted a study to understand the test time security vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art MLPU systems in order to provide guidelines for the future development of these systems. Method: In this paper, we propose an evasion attack framework against MLPU systems. To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial phishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline performance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU systems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to the previous works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with an average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and less popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively; (ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL variant that is available for registration with a median cost of only $11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google SafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that Adversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not significantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the success rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv) Further, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU systems. Our findings can lead to promising directions for the future research. Conclusion: Our study not only illustrate vulnerabilities in MLPU systems but also highlights the implications for future research towards assessing and improving these systems.",

            "text": "A URL is a concise sequence of characters that points to a unique web resource (e.g. file, web page) [27] . In contrast, a phishing URL points to a counterfeit version of the legitimate website. For instance, \"https://www.paypal.com/\" is a URL of Paypal company that points to a legitimate online payment service. However, \"http://paypal.com.igr2.ru/n\" is a phishing URL that was recently detected by Openphish [60] . Although, phishing URLs are not associated with the actual genuine websites, their associated websites often look alike [104] . Figure 1 shows an example of an official Paypal sign-in page versus its counterfeit version access through these two URLs. Both pages look similar with only a few differences in the URL of both sites. Since the two websites and their URLs look similar, the counterfeit website can deceive a naive user into giving away sensitive information (such as credentials and credit card number) or downloading malicious software. Consequently, it can cause financial and reputational losses to the user and the legitimate businesses [59] . Therefore, it is critical to detect them promptly. To this end, several efforts have been made by the industry [20, 32, 37, 43, 67, 75, 84, 94] and academia [1, 10, 21, 76, 96] to prevent people from visiting these URLs. However, the lines of defences are mostly reactive measures that rely on updating the sets of rules for domain registrations or adding new phishing URLs reported by users in blacklists of already known phishing URLs. For example, recently a new vulnerability was discovered in Verisign and other software as a Service (SaaS) [9] including Google, Amazon, and DigitalOcean that allowed people to register \".com\" and \".net\" homograph domain names [15] (similar-looking characters but having different Unicode, e.g., \"www.microsoftonLine.com\" against \"www.microsoftoline.com) generated using IPA Extensions [92] . To resolve this issue, Verisign and Amazon (S3) had to deploy new changes to upgrade their registration rules. These solutions have following limitations: (i) they cannot handle zero-day attacks (new phishing URL not in the blacklist). (ii) they require constant updates and (iii) they are not scalable.

Over the years, many studies [6, 72, 80] have proposed MLPU systems ranging from traditional Machine Learning (ML) that use classical ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) to more complex Deep Learning (DL) methods. These studies have shown that these MLPU obtain good accuracy and effectiveness in detecting zero-day (unseen) phishing URLs. For example, [47] showed that their method could differentiate between phishing and legitimate URLs with an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.29%. However, MLPU systems are also subject to some limitations.",

Such an analysis can help the practitioners to select robust features and classifiers for developing MLPU systems. Whilst it can also assist researchers in identifying security vulnerabilities in these systems. \u2022 In RQ2, we further investigate the evasion behaviours of all the models with each evasion adversary type. This analysis identifies the most potent adversary type (an adversary with highest success rate across all the models). These insights can guide the researchers to carry more specific research and development efforts towards defending the potent adversaries. \u2022 Adversarial training is a popular technique largely used in image [82] and text [73] classification to improve model robustness. It increases the robustness of ML models by augmenting adversarial examples with training data. RQ3 examines whether integrating the adversarial training can serve to advance the robustness of the test models against evasion attack. This type of analysis can help the practitioners to understand whether or not an adversarial training is a suitable defense against evasion attacks. Moreover, researchers can perform their researches on evasion defences to improve the robustness of MLPU systems. \u2022 Lastly, RQ4 assesses the actual threat posed by an evasion attack by studying the computational effort, scale, registration price and availability of our generated phishing URLs. This analysis can help to understand the ease of registering a phishing domain and unveil the vulnerabilities in overall web infrastructure, which can guide the future research. To answer these questions, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 41 state-of-the-art MLPU systems against our evasion attack. We first generate three types of adversaries (adversarial phishing URLs) by introducing perturbation on three parts of the target URL, i.e., domain, path and Top Level Domain (TLD). We then train 41 MLPU systems to reproduce the state-of-the-art models. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack on these MLPU systems. By further analysing the results and answers to these questions, we distil potential vulnerabilities in considered MLPU systems and recommend future direction to improve these systems.",

The scheme indicates the network protocol for accessing the requested resource. The most common protocols are Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), HTTP with Transport Layer Security (HTTPS), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). A domain is a name that points to the server or computer that host the resource (website or file). The domain can be a direct Internet Protocol (IP) address of a computer. For example, \"212.432.43.09\" is a valid URL that contains the IP address to represent the domain. However, IP addresses are hard to remember; therefore, domain names are used instead. E.g., for the URL 'https://aws.amazon.com/login?id=xyz#abc', 'amazon' is the domain name for Amazon website. A sub-domain is an additional part of the primary domain name. Sub-domains systematize different sections of the website. In the above example, 'aws' is a sub-domain that indicates Amazon Web Services (AWS) section of the main Amazon website. A Top-level-Domain (TLD) indicates the type of the website. E.g. '.gov' correspond to government website while '.edu' suggest that a website is educational. A domain name, along with its TLD is called the hostname and is unique across the internet. In the above example, \"amazon.com\" is a unique identity of the Amazon organization on the Internet. A path represents the address of the location of a resource within a website. It is analogues to the underlying file structure of the website. 'login' in the above example indicates the login page location is the root directory of the 'amazon'. A query-string defines the values to the site parameter. For instance, id=xyz assign 'xyz' to id parameter. The last part of the URL is a fragment. Both query string and fragment are optional parts of a URL. Fragment identifies the portion of a webpage and helps in navigation within a page.",

For instance, a study [57] identified two types of obfuscation techniques used by the attacker: hostname obfuscation and directory obfuscation. In hostname obfuscation, the attacker replaces the hostname of the phishing URL with an IP or a brand name e.g., 'http://34.227.96.252/d/internet/dosegmento', 'www.hi-google.com'. In the directory obfuscation technique, an attacker manipulates the path of the phishing URL using encoding, redirection or hexadecimal numbers. For example, '/%63ur%65' is an encoded hexadecimal form for the word 'cure'.",

The authors then identified bad and good features based on GPPF score feedback and then devised two attacks, namely addition of good features and removal of bad features. The study found that the GPPF can be evaded successfully by on average adding three good and eliminating five bad features. Additionally, the study also unveiled that adding only 2.5% good URL features could result in a successful evasion attack. This is an interesting observation suggesting the Phishing URL features can affect not only MLPU but also effect the state-of-the-art industrial Phishing page detectors like GPPF.

These constraints are usually data-dependent, e.g., for textual data, the limitation is the adversarial example must follow the grammar and syntax format of the used language [102] . We formulate three main constraints that our generated adversarial phishing URLs must satisfy. (a) The adversarial example must be a valid URL, i.e., it must follow the generic syntax provided by RFC 3986 [27] . (b) They should either contain the target domain name as a part of the adversarial URL or the edit distance (number of character transformations) between real and adversarial URLs must be minimal [28] (less than 10% of the total length of the real URL). These constraints are essential for satisfying the semantics of the phishing URLs [46] . (c) They should be available for registration.

For each related word r in the list R n , the algorithm concatenates it with d using '.' and op i.e. ('-' or \") to create url sub and url part respectively. For illustration, against 'Netflix', our algorithm produces a new domain 'netflix.hd'. The generated domain is 'hd, whereas 'netflix' is a subdomain. Similarly, four url part are produced i.e., 'hd-netflix', 'netflix-hd','hdnetflix' and 'netflixhd' against 'netflix'. Here, the above generated adversarial example combines the target domain \"Netflix\" which provides video streaming service to users with HD short form for high definition video quality. Both words semantically convey that \"Netflix in HD quality\". As we have mentioned earlier that the domain name may contain multiple word tokens.",

            "text": "We further analyzed the results based on three categories: adversary type, level of granularity and URL obfuscation. Figure 5 shows the box-plot analysis of each category over all the 41 models. Figure 5 (a) demonstrates that both domain and path adversaries are highly successful in evading all the models with a median success rate of approximately 70%. On the other hand, TLD adversary is not significantly successful, attaining a median success rate of 55.29%. One reason behind this result is that we used an already known list of malicious TLD to create these adversaries. Thus there is a high chance that these TLD are already present in phishing class distribution of training data set. Despite their presence, these adversaries are still able to deceive the underlying models half of the time. Another interesting observation is that path adversary has an outlier with a minimum success rate of only 9.06%, indicating that one of the models (LR-Basic Lexical) tends to classify path adversary as phishing URLs. However, the original accuracy of this model is only 89% with an FNR of 21.80%. Figure 5 (b) shows the performance of all the adversaries in terms of the perturbation level. The character-level perturbation is more powerful (i.e., median of 97%) than word-level. We expected this result as a character-level perturbation introduces new character distributions (Out of Vocabulary problem) that may not be present in the training data. An interesting observation is that character perturbation achieves a success rate of more than 94% even for the models that work based on character-based features. Figure 5 (c) illustrates the relation of success rate with the URL obfuscation technique. Among Character level techniques, all the URL obfuscation were able to evade all the model with a median of more than 90%. Specifically, omission, subdomain, transpose, and homoglyph obfuscation techniques had a median success rate of 100%. Even the highly accurate deep learning models were 100% evaded by these methods. In contrast, in word-based obfuscation method word repetition was able to evade all the models more effectively (median 86.49%) than other methods. Whereas, word hyphenation and subdomain based obfuscation method showed a minimum success rate with a median of 38 and 40% respectively. This result shows that the current baseline models yield unreliable results for all the obfuscation methods, especially character-level perturbations such as subdomain, transpose and obfuscation technique. Summary: Domain and path adversaries are more successful than a TLD adversary. We found that MLPU systems are highly sensitive to character-level perturbations, especially subdomain, omission and homoglyph methods. Figure 6a depicts the difference between average validation accuracies of original versus adversarially trained models. The result shows that there is no significant difference between the average validation accuracy of models with and without adversarial training. With an exception to SVM and LR trained over basic lexical features, the performance of all other models is slightly (<1%) increased notably for Deep learning models. Figure 6b shows the evasion results of the original versus adversarially trained models for adversarial URLs F tar generated using S \u2032 . Compared to original models, 31 out of 36 adversarial trained models have less success rate on our attack. However, still, the average success rate of our attack is 79.85% across these models for F tar . The decrease in success rate is prominent for models using word-based and basic lexical features as compared to those using character-level features with exception of the Expose model. Additionally,the models using LR, XGB, LGBM and Bags of CNN become comparatively more robust by adversarial training than models using RF, SVM and DT as classifiers. Interestingly, there is an increase in success rate for five models, notably for URLNET word and special character level CNN, on which the success rate is increased by 14.88% compared to the original model.",

However, it is more severe for Phishing URL detection because for a given website, the domain name can be repeated in the training dataset at most to number of webpages on a website whereas the probability of the same path, query-string and parameter repetition across all the legitimate URLs is relatively low. Subsequently, for the phishing URLs, an attacker usually generates multiple URLs of the same kind [77] targeting popular brands. Therefore, the probability of phishing tokens appearing as features is high but, limited to specific brands. Figure 8 (a) and (b) shows the word cloud for individual legitimate, and phishing dataset while (c) shows BoW vocabulary of the combined training dataset, respectively. Most of the words appearing in BoW features are high-frequency words from phishing URLs. In contrast, only a few domain names from the legitimate dataset (Geocities, pastehtml and Wikipedia) with more webpages appear in the vocabulary. It suggests that the training vocabulary is more biased towards phishing tokens while the legitimate domain names remain underrepresented. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by generating adversarial examples against less popular targets and with more legitimate keywords as also shown by our results (Figure 8 ).",

Furthermore, this issue is not only limited to the domain names but also extends to other recurring tokens in phishing dataset. These systems misclassify all the examples with login keyword irrespective of the legitimate or phishing nature of a URL. e.g., \"http://www.netflix.com/login\" are misclassified by all models decision boundary.

These phishing URLs get detected and subsequently get added in the blacklist such as PhishTank or OpenPhish. As the training dataset for phishing URLs is mostly collected from the open-source threat intelligence sites, these URLs become a part of the training dataset of the models. Later, the attacker carries out an actual attack by using a different kind of URLs (similar to legitimate URLs pattern, i.e., less than 30 characters impersonating Common Wealth Bank).

Comprehensive experimental results and evaluation have shown that our proposed attack is effective and realistic for generating targeted adversarial phishing URLs. Our study has revealed that considered MLPU systems are highly sensitive to the character-level perturbations. We have also discovered that adversarial training is not an effective defence against our attack. Additionally, we have found that there is a lack of information exchange between online blacklist, WHOIS and domain registration services that hamper users to get precise, consistent and up-to-date information regarding a URL that they intend to visit. On further analysis, we have identified several limitations of the considered MLPU systems that include incomplete modelling assumption and biases towards phishing trends. The implication of our study and the limitations of our research are presented below:",

This suggests that the performance should not be used as a sole criterion for an effective MLPU system. The researchers can propose standard metric to quantify the robustness and performance of these systems. This type of metric can help to select robust and effective hyper-parameters of the models while training. (2) We have found that the considered MLPU systems can be evaded successfully by our attack and have also identified the most powerful adversaries (adversary type, perturbation level and obfuscation method). In future, researchers can conduct more focused research on these adversaries to propose more robust and effective MLPU systems. (3) We have also discovered that the MLPU systems are biased towards Phishing URL dataset that is one of the reasons behind the success of our evasion attack. The researchers can propose solutions to address this limitation. (4) Our results revealed that the adversarial training is not suitable for defending the considered MLPU systems against our evasion attack. The researchers can introduce effective defence mechanisms for protecting MLPU systems from evasion attacks. (5) We have shown that there is a gap in phishing detection infrastructure. In future, the researcher can propose a standard synchronization mechanism to exchange information between different services (blacklist, domain registration and WHOIS) so that users can get precise, consistent and up-to-date information regarding the URL they intend to visit.",

While we used a large dataset obtained from various sources, we cannot generalize our findings to industry or open-source solution using different features and classifiers.

Thirdly, our approach does not assume any knowledge of the target ML system to generate adversarial examples whereas Deepphish and GAN attacks utilize the knowledge of the phishing score and the features respectively.
