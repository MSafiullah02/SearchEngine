Currently, no specific drug has been confirmed to treat COVID-19, and drugs of pre-approval access are still in ongoing clinical trials. The safety and efficacy of these medications remains unclear, and some drugs (such as lopinavir-ritonavir and arbidol) may cause serious adverse reactions. Therefore, hospital pharmacists should actively participate in making evidence-based decisions for medications, and assist clinicians in formulating and adjusting drug regimens of COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, hospital pharmacists should provide close monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, management of drug interactions, and monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy. Based on the characteristics of special populations and patients with underlying diseases, pharmacists should provide strengthened pharmaceutical care services. In addition, the emotional status of COVID-19 patients is also an important factor affecting the treatment and prognosis of the disease. It's necessary for hospital pharmacists to provide COVID-19 patients with emotional counselling and psychological support. Given the importance and urgency of COVID-19 vaccine development for the control of global pandemic, hospital pharmacists should also provide vaccine-related scientific information to patients. To this end, the pharmaceutical care framework of COVID-19 hospitalized patients for hospital pharmacists was researched and constructed (see Fig. 1\nfor details) to help promote the pandemic control and patient management.",

Therefore, in order to avoid symptoms aggravation due to drug interactions, pharmacists should be highly vigilant for potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions, strengthen the management of patients\u2019 medication and diet. Taking lopinavir-ritonavir as an example, clinicians and pharmacists should avoid combining other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme (nifedipine, atorvastatin, midazolam, etc.), and educate patients not to eat foods that affect the CYP3A enzyme (grapefruit, honey, etc.). In addition, in the current clinical practice, it has been proved that integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine has a certain effect on COVID-19. Pharmacists should also strengthen the interaction management between traditional Chinese and western medicine, and recommend patients to take medicines at intervals.",

It is recommended to use medications with FDA Pregnancy Category B or C, and avoid using medications of D class.22 Regularly monitor vital signs of patients and fetuses during medication use, and adjust medication regimens if necessary. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and prevent drugs\u2019 harm to infants through breast milk, pharmacists should advise lactating patients to suspend breastfeeding.23 As the safety and efficacy of antiviral drugs for children and adolescents remains unclear, medication regimens should be formulated carefully. For critically ill children, drugs for adults could be considered and dosage must be adjusted.24 For elderly patients with impaired immunity or complicated chronic diseases, pharmacists should adjust the dosage according to their liver and kidney function, manage medications for secondary prevention, and pay close attention to drug interactions.",

CPT is an effective therapy choice, and has been successfully applied to the treatment of SARS and H1N1 influenza.27 Before conducting CPT, pharmacists should assist clinicians in assessing patients' indications of CPT, combining with allergy history, contraindications of plasma transfusion, and individual clinical conditions. Also, the infusion dose should be formulated based on patients\u2019 weight and clinical condition, usually ranging from 200 ml to 500 mL (4\u20135 mL/kg). When performing CPT, pharmacists need to closely record and monitor adverse effects of plasma transfusion before, during, and after transfusion, and cooperate with clinicians to manage adverse effects. Common adverse transfusion reactions include transfusion-related circulation overload, acute lung injury, dyspnea, allergic, hypotension, non-hemolytic febrile, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, infectious transfusion reaction, etc.",
