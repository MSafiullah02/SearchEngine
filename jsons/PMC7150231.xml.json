            "text": "In early 2003, about 8500 people were diagnosed across the world with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Among them, almost 800 died due to its first outbreak. The disease was broken out and turned into an epidemic in Guangdong of South China. Two cases of SARS infections were noticed in Taiwan and Singapore due to improper handling of the samples in the research laboratory. During April 2004, a \u201cmini outbreak\u201d of infections took place in a research laboratory of Beijing that, in turn, led to a chain of infections across three generations. Fortunately, the total number of SARS-infected people was only nine that time. This incidence threatens us about the mini outbreaks of SARS globally at any time (Anand et al., 2005). The SARS is caused by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that belongs to the family of Coronaviridae. This family also includes viruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as well as human coronavirus 229E (Kim et al., 2015). The SARS is considered as a global threat to the health (Khan, 2013, Perlman and Netland, 2009). Moreover, water and food-borne viral gastroenteritis may be caused by the noroviruses that belong to the family Calciviridae (Atmar, 2010, Patel et al., 2009). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop small molecule antiviral drugs to combat these viruses. The picornavirus belongs to the family of viruses namely Picornaviridae, Calciviridae, and Coronaviridae (Mandadapu et al., 2013a). A number of pathogeneses in human may occur due to these viruses leading to economic and medical burden. For example, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the major reason for upper respiratory tract infection (Ren et al., 2012, Turner and Couch, 2007, Winther, 2011) whereas nonpolio enteroviruses are responsible for symptomatic infections with 10\u201315 million cases per year in United States (McMinn, 2012, Solomon et al., 2010). Depending on the similarity of the polycistronic organization of the genome, common and posttranscriptional strategies along with the conserved region of domain homology in viral proteins, the virus families are related phylogenetically though these families are not related morphologically (Anand et al., 2005, Cavanagh, 1997, Cowley et al., 2000). Coronavirus is found to be responsible for causing a number of diseases not only in human but also in animals, though the human coronavirus has not been taken into account seriously before the SARS outbreak (Anand et al., 2005). Human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and 229E may be responsible for illness in the upper portion of the respiratory tract along with common cold-like conditions (Myint, 1995). The HCoV 229E is the only strain till date that can be cultured in cell culture technique efficiently. The symptoms of SARS include rigor, malaise, high degree of fever, cough, headache, and dyspnoea. The symptoms may also lead to produce interstitial infiltrates in lungs that may be treated through ventilation and intubation (Lee et al., 2003). Not only the lungs but also other organs may be affected by SARS infection (such as liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract). Therefore, the SARS infection may be treated as a cause of systemic infection. Face-to-face contacts may be supposed to be the reason for transmission of the pathogen though other routes are also possible. A number of inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CLpro and HRV 3Cpro were reported and the process of development of new antivirals against this class has been continued for a decade. In the present report, quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs) techniques have been explored to understand the relation between the SARS-CoV 3CLpro and HRV 3Cpro enzyme inhibitory activity with the physicochemical and structural properties of these inhibitors developed till now. This approach may be a useful strategy to design and develop novel and potential SARS-CoV 3CLpro and HRV 3Cpro inhibitors to combat the dreadful viral infections.",

The RNAs are polyadenylated and 5\u2032capped. These are translated into large polyproteins following their entry into the host cell. The polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved by viral proteinases resulting in viral gene products. The RNA polymerase (pol) is found to be encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV and four structural proteins that commonly include the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the order of Pol-S-E-M-N. The spike protein (S) is the antigenic determinant for coronavirus and is found to be involved in receptor binding. The E protein plays a significant role during viral assembly. The M glycoprotein transmembrane envelope is found abundantly and is responsible for budding of the virus, and the N protein is related to the viral RNA packaging (Holmes, 2003, Shigeta and Yamase, 2005, Zhai et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Coronavirus contains a positive-stranded RNA with a single-stranded, large size (27\u201331 kb) RNA genome. Two overlapping polyproteins, that is, pp1a (450 kDa approx.) and pp1ab (750 kDa approx.) are encoded by the replicase gene with more than 20,000 nucleotides (Herold et al., 1993). These two polyproteins regulate the replication, as well as transcription processes in the virus (Thiel et al., 2001). Proteolysis helps to liberate nonstructural proteins (nsp) from these polyproteins. The proteolytic cleavage is mainly controlled by the viral proteinase termed as Mpro (Anand et al., 2005). The Mpro is a cysteine proteinase which is synonymous or rather called as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) as the substrate specificity resembles picornavirus 3C-protease (3Cpro), though both of these viruses are structurally less similar (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2005). The 3CLpro is found to cleave the polyprotein at 11 conserved region including Leu-Gln\u2193 sequences which are initiated by the autolytic cleavage of the enzyme from pp1a and pp1ab (Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002b, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins help to release functional polypeptides by papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3CLpro is located in the nonstructural protein regions, namely nsp3 and nsp5 (Fig. 11.1\n) via proteolytic reaction mechanisms (Grum-Tokars et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Three noncanonical Mpro cleavage sites are observed in SARS coronavirus polyproteins having Val, Met, or Phe amino acid residues at P2 position whereas the same cleavage site is found dissimilar in other coronaviruses. Therefore, the structural and functional criteria of Mpro helps to identify it as an important target for developing anti-SARS drugs or other anticoronaviral drugs (Anand et al., 2005). The structures of HCoV 229E Mpro, TGEV Mpro, and SARS-CoV Mpro demonstrate that these enzymes have three distinct domains. The first two domains (domain I and II) together possess similarity with chymotrypsin whereas the third one consists of an \u03b1-helical fold which is unique (Anand et al., 2005). The active site which is situated between the first two domains possesses a Cys-His catalytic site. Antiparallel \u03b2-barrels with six strands are composed of the domain I and II (residues 8\u201399 of I and 100\u2013183 of II, respectively). The domain II is connected to domain III (residues 200\u2013300) through a long loop (residues 184\u2013199) (Anand et al., 2005). The hydrophobic amino acid residues are found to compose the domain I \u03b2-barrel. The \u03b1-helix (residues 53\u201358) helps to close the \u03b2-barrel like a lid. The domain I is bigger than domain II, as well as the homologous domain II of chymotrypsin and 3Cpro of HAV (Allaire et al., 1994, Bergmann et al., 1997, Tsukada and Blow, 1985). Moreover, a number of secondary structural elements are found to be missing in coronavirus Mpro compared to HAV 3Cpro (such as strands b2II and cII along with the linking loop). The Gly135 to Ser146 form a portion of the barrel though domain II possesses maximum consecutive turns and loops. Moreover, the structural alignment of coronavirus Mpro domain II with the picornavirus 3Cpro domain II is found to be different. Superimposition of domain I of TGEV Mpro, with HAV 3Cpro domain I results in a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.85 \u01fa whereas superimposition of domain II of both of these enzymes yields a rmsd of 3.25 \u01fa. The overall rmsd for the C\u03b1 atoms between their structures is >2 \u01fa for all 300 C\u03b1 positions and the three Mpro structures possess similarity among themselves (Anand et al., 2005). The helical domain III is the most variable domain that exhibits a better overlapping between HCoV Mpro and TGEV Mpro compared to the SARS-CoV Mpro, with each other. Moreover, TGEV and HCoV 229E (belongs to group I coronavirus) show 61% sequence similarity whereas SARS-CoV (belongs to group II coronavirus) exhibits 40% and 44% sequence similarity with HCoV 229E and TGEV, respectively (Anand et al., 2003). A high degree of conserved region (42%\u201348%) between the domain I and II is observed while comparing group I coronavirus Mpro, and group II SARS-CoV Mpro. The domain III comparatively exhibits a lower degree of sequence similarity (36%\u201340%) between these two groups coronaviral enzymes (Anand et al., 2005). The X-ray crystallography structures of SARS-CoV Mpro, TGEV Mpro, and HCoV 229E Mpro show that these form dimers (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003). Moreover, it was also confirmed that the dimer form is enzymatically active but the monomeric form is not active (Anand et al., 2005, Fan et al., 2004). The dimerization process is found to be mandatory for enzyme activity and this process helps to discriminate the coronavirus Mpro, and the picornavirus Mpro distinctly.",

The X-ray crystallographic study between the inhibitor-SARS CoV Mpro suggests that the imidazole function of His163 is located at the bottom of the S1 site of Mpro to donate hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl function of glutamine. For interaction with glutamine at S1 site, the histidine amino acid residue has to be remained unaltered over a broad range of pH. This may be possible through two interactions involved in the imidazole ring. It may either stack to the phenyl ring of Phe140 or may accept a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl function of Tyr161. Replacement of the His163 is found to abolish the proteolytic activity (Hegyi et al., 2002a, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). All these residues discussed are found to be conserved not only in SARS-CoV Mpro but also in all other coronavirus main proteases. Moreover, residues Ile51, Met151, Glu166, and His172 of the S1 pocket take part in the conformation of SARS-CoV Mpro (Anand et al., 2005). Regarding the S2 specificity site, all the coronaviruses Mpro consists of a leucine residue at the S2 cleavage site. This S2 site is hydrophobic in nature and is composed of side chain amino acid residues, such as His41, Thr47, Met49, Tyr53, and Met165. The longer methionine residue may restrict the S2 pocket and requires slight spatial orientation to accommodate the substrate leucine residue. Due to the presence of Ala46 residue and differences in amino acid sequences, the S2 pocket is bigger in SARS-CoV Mpro compared to HCoV 229E Mpro and TGEV Mpro. In SARS-CoV Mpro, a stretch of amino acid sequences is observed in 40\u201350 residues that help to enlarge the size by forming a helix which is not observed in other coronaviruses. This bigger size may be effective in the substrate binding (Anand et al., 2005). Apart from the S1 and S2 pockets, some other substrate binding pockets should be taken into consideration. At the P4 position, small amino acid residues may be preferable (such as Val, Thr, Ser, and Pro) whereas no specificity at the P3 position is observed for coronavirus Mpro. At the P4 position, some amino acid residues are found to be conserved in SARS-CoV Mpro (such as Met165 and Thr190). Moreover, P5 amino acid side chains are found to interact with the main chain at Pro168, Thr190, and Gln192 in SARS-CoV Mpro, and help like a linker between domain II and III.",

            "text": "Apart from antivirals to fight against these coronaviruses, RNA interference (RNAi) and vaccine development may be a useful strategy though it is a challenging task. The RNAi is an important tool for gene silencing. Apart from the use of RNAi in cancer and genetic disorder (Wang et al., 2004), development of siRNA inhibitors in SARS infection may be a boon for the treatment of the disease (Li et al., 2005). The replication of the SARS may be inhibited effectively through RNAi in vero cells. Therefore, siRNA therapy may be effective to combat SARS infection (Wang et al., 2004). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) may be useful to target the N gene sequence of SARS coronavirus and to inhibit shRNA of SARS-CoV antigen expression (Tao et al., 2005, Zhai et al., 2007). These results suggest that gene silencing through RNAi may effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV antigen expression, and, therefore, RNAi approach may be effectively utilized as possible therapy for inhibiting SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, the RNAi is used to target the replicase enzyme of human SARS virus. It not only targets the hSARS gene but also produces inhibitory effects on the SARS RNA virus expression (Zhai et al., 2007). As far as the development of SARS vaccines is concerned, the inactivated SARS-CoV along with the full-length S protein and an attenuated weak virus, and recombinant SARS protein may be used (Jiang et al., 2005, Zhai et al., 2007). The S protein and the inactivated virus were reported to be used to neutralize antibodies. The attenuated or the weak form of the virus might be used to induce immunity, as well as to neutralize antibodies (Finlay et al., 2004). The development of recombinant vaccines may be a useful strategy to prevent SARS infections. It mainly depends on the best antigen identification, as well as the choice of expression system. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV along with its truncated form may be targeted for development of recombinant vaccine as the best candidate (Babcock et al., 2004, Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004, Zhai et al., 2007). A number of reports were published regarding recombinant S protein vaccine against different SARS-CoV through aryl delivery system (Pogrebnyak et al., 2005, Tuboly et al., 2000).",

Compound 8 having maximum SA exhibits hydrogen bonding with His41 and Cys145 through the keto functions of the isatin moiety. Moreover, the carboxamide function at the R2 position makes hydrogen bonding with Phe140 and His163.

Compounds with the smaller halogen substitution, such as fluorine at R position (Compound 8, Table 11.20) are better than compounds with the bigger halogen substituents, such as the chloro (Compounds 2 and 6, Table 11.20). Further, a dihalo substituted compound, such as compound 7 was shown to be less active as compared to monohalo-substituted analogs (Compounds 2, 6, and 8). The cyano (Compound 4) and the nitro (Compound 9) substitutions also produced the higher activity as compared to the methoxy substitution (Compound 3). The docking study suggested that the N1-phenyl group was located near to the S1\u2019 pocket. One of the oxygen atoms of the nitro group forms a hydrogen bond with Gly143. The keto function of the pyrazolone ring was also found to form another hydrogen bond with Glu166. The C-3 phenyl ring was found to be well-accommodated in the S2 pocket. The benzylidene ring without any carboxyl functions lost the activity. Therefore, it may be assumed that hydrogen bonding interaction is more important than the hydrophobic interaction. The oxygen atom of the carboxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with Gln192. Therefore, apart from S2 pocket, none of the aryl functions has exhibited hydrophobic interactions, whereas three hydrogen bonding interactions were observed.

Moreover, some structural indicator variables were found to play an important role for inhibition of these enzymes. In many cases, the dipole moment and the PSA were found to be dominant factors. The bulk of the inhibitors and their flexibility and polarity also appeared to play crucial roles in the inhibition of the enzyme. Most of the QSAR models exhibited a direct correlation of dipole moment with the 3CLpro or 3Cpro inhibitory activity, where a majority of them showed the positive effect of dipole moment on activity but few showed the negative effect, too. These positive and negative effects may be attributed to the orientation of the inhibitor molecules in the active site of the enzyme.",

With their positive coefficients in the correlation, they indicated the attractive electronic interactions of the molecules with the enzyme, and with negative coefficient, they indicated the repulsive interaction. In many cases, the polar volume was found to govern the activity. The polar volume also indicated the attractive or repulsive dispersion interaction between the molecule and the receptor.",

            "text": "Among all, the hydrophobicity of the molecules had its own role. In any drug-receptor interaction, hydrophobicity is found to play an important role because in most of the enzymes the active site has a hydrophobic pocket which plays an important role in the activity of the site. In most of the cases, the bulky portion of the molecule tries to occupy this hydrophobic pocket where it may have hydrophobic interaction. The molecular volume, MW, or molar refractivity all sometimes become synonymous to the hydrophobic property of the molecules. If they are not found related to hydrophobicity and are crucial for the activity, then it means that the inhibitor-enzyme interaction involves dispersion interaction. The QSAR models discussed here may be a great help to design some new, more potent compounds in any given category of SARS-CoV 3CLpro or HRV 3Cpro inhibitors.",
