The genus Enterovirus, which is by far the largest genus, comprises many human pathogens, including poliovirus, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, numbered enteroviruses (e.g., EV-A71 and EV-D68), and rhinoviruses. Infections with non-polio enteroviruses can result in a wide variety of symptoms, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis, whereas infections with rhinoviruses cause the common cold as well as exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (reviewed in Ref. [1]). Vaccines are only available against poliovirus and EV-A71. Development of vaccines against all enteroviruses seems unfeasible, given the large number of (sero)types (i.e., >100 non-polio enteroviruses and >150 rhinoviruses). Hence, there is a great need for (broad-acting) antivirals against entero-viruses. Here, we will review recent efforts to develop direct-acting antivirals as well as host factor-targeting inhibitors to treat enterovirus infections (Table 1\n).",

The enterovirus replication cycle (Figure 1\nb) is initiated by binding of a virion to its receptor. Most enterovirus receptors are protein receptors that belong to the Ig superfamily or the integrin receptor family (reviewed in Ref. [2]). The receptors usually bind in the \u2018canyon\u2019, a depression in the virion surface around the five-fold axes of symmetry [2]. Receptor-binding induces virion destabilization and release of the \u2018pocket factor\u2019, a fatty acid located in a hydrophobic pocket beneath the canyon, to initiate virion uncoating [2].",

These compounds replace the pocket factor in the canyon and thereby block virion uncoating. Clinical trials for the capsid binders pleconaril, vapendavir (a.k.a. BTA798), and pocapavir (a.k.a. V-073) are currently in progress or have recently been completed, the status of which has been described last year [5]. Since then, another trial with pleconaril was conducted for the treatment of neonates with enterovirus sepsis, which showed greater survival among pleconaril recipients [6]. A major drawback of capsid binders is the rapid emergence of resistance. Indeed, in a clinical trial for the treatment of rhinovirus infections with pleconaril, compound-resistant viruses were isolated [7]. In addition, naturally occurring pleconaril-resistant viruses (e.g., an echovirus 11 strain) have been reported [8]. These resistance issues may complicate the application of capsid binders in the clinic.",

Furthermore, the hydrophobic pocket is filled with bulky hydrophobic residues, thereby not providing sufficient space for a pocket factor or a capsid binder.

One of the best-described compounds targeting sialic acids is DAS181, a bacterial sialidase that cleaves \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-sialic acid linkages, and that has been tested in a phase II clinical trial for (para)influenza infection [15, 16].

Because it is very active against a broad panel of enteroviruses [3, 19, 20, 21], this compound was selected for clinical trials, despite its poor oral bioavailability [22, 23]. Although the results of rhinovirus challenge trials were promising [24], rupintrivir did not reduce disease severity in naturally infected patients [25], hence the clinical development was halted. However, many rupintrivir derivatives are currently under development [26, 27, 28]. Furthermore, non-peptidomimetic small molecule inhibitors are developed to circumvent difficulties with bioavailability [29], but they have yet to be evaluated in clinical trials.",

Another example is NITD008, which failed in preclinical studies for the treatment of dengue virus infection due to toxicity.

For example, the NI gemcitabine, an anticancer drug, was recently found to exert broad-spectrum anti-enteroviral activity [35, 36]. Besides incorporation into nascent viral RNA, gemcitabine has been suggested to block access of nucleotides into the active side of the polymerase. Furthermore, gemcitabine blocks viral genome replication by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, the cellular enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of deoxyribonucleotides to ribonucleotides [35]. The dose of gemcitabine needed for antiviral activity is significantly lower than the dose for the anticancer activity, which raises hope for an application without toxic effects that are inherent to many anticancer drugs.",

GPC-N114 was identified as a novel broad-range enterovirus inhibitor that targets the RNA template-primer site in the core of 3Dpol, making it the first anti-enteroviral compound with this mechanism of action [37\u2022\u2022]. Unfortunately, the efficacy of GPC-N114 in animal models remains to be tested due to problems with formulating the compound for in vivo use. Alternative strategies for 3Dpol inhibition, although thus far unexplored, may be to interfere with posttranslational modifications of 3Dpol like sumoylation and ubiquitination, both of which are important for 3Dpol activity [38].",

[5]). Several structurally disparate 2CATPase inhibitors have been identified, such as guanidine hydrochloride, HBB, MRL-1237 and TBZE-029 [3]. In addition, drug repurposing screens have recently uncovered a number of FDA-approved drugs (fluoxetine, pirlindole, dibucaine, zuclopenthixol) that inhibit replication of enterovirus species B and D members [39, 40, 41]. Since mutations in 2CATPase provide resistance to these compounds, they are considered to target 2CATPase. Indeed, fluoxetine (i.e., Prozac) was shown to interfere with the ATPase activity of 2CATPase, but the mechanism of inhibition of the other drugs has yet to be unraveled [40]. Recent in vitro experiments have confirmed the long-presumed ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity and ATPase-independent RNA chaperone functions of 2CATPase [42\u2022\u2022], paving the way for studies to elucidate the mechanism of action of 2CATPase inhibitors in more detail. So far, 2CATPase inhibitors have not been tested in clinical trials. However, fluoxetine was effective in an immunocompromised child with chronic enterovirus encephalitis [43\u2022], implying that 2CATPase inhibitors have potential for clinical use.",

Assisted by the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) [44, 45], P1 is processed into VP0 (i.e., the precursor of VP4 and VP2), VP1, and VP3, which spontaneously form a protomer. Five protomers subsequently assemble into a pentamer, twelve of which in turn form an empty capsid (a.k.a. procapsid). Assembly of pentamers and procapsids is supported by glutathione by an as yet unidentified mechanism [46\u2022, 47\u2022]. Governed by interactions between VP1/VP3 and 2CATPase [44, 48, 49, 50], actively replicating viral RNA is included in the procapsid to form a provirion.

The formation of enterovirus ROs is mediated by the concerted actions of viral proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A, as well as a selected set of hijacked host factors (recently reviewed in Ref. [52]). One of these pivotal host factors is phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type III\u03b2 (PI4KB) [52, 54]. It is recruited to membranes by the viral protein 3A and enriches ROs in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids, which is essential for genomic RNA replication [53\u2022\u2022]. As PI4KB is essential for all enteroviruses, inhibitors of this enzyme (e.g., PIK93, GW5074, T-00127-HEV1 and BF738735) (reviewed in Ref. [5]) have broad-spectrum activity [53\u2022\u2022, 54, 55, 56]. However, some PI4KB inhibitors showed lethal toxicity in mice and affected lymphocyte function in vitro, which has stalled the development of PI4KB inhibitors [57]. Besides the fact that PI4KB inhibitors may be toxic, their activity may also be overcome by some mutations in the viral 3A, as recently published [58, 59].",

We identified the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) as a novel target of itraconazole responsible for the antiviral effects [60\u2022\u2022]. OSBP is a PI4P-binding protein that shuttles cholesterol and PI4P at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites [62]. OSBP is recruited to ROs through the PI4KB-mediated increase in PI4P and its lipid shuttling activity is essential for viral genome replication. Other OSBP inhibitors (e.g., 25-hydroxycholesterol, AN-12-H5, T-00127-HEV2, TTP-8307, and the natural compound OSW-1) also impaired enterovirus replication [56, 63, 64, 65]. In a rhinovirus mouse model, prophylactic intranasal treatment with itraconazole reduced viral titers and pathology, raising expectations for topically applied itraconazole to prevent or treat common colds [66].",

Cyclophilins facilitate protein folding by catalyzing peptide bond isomerization and also play a role in the replication of other +RNA viruses, including HCV and coronaviruses (reviewed in Ref. [68]). Because cyclophilin inhibitors like cyclosporine A have an immunosuppressive effect, non-immunosuppressive inhibitors (e.g., NIM-811 [69]) were developed and are currently in clinical trials for antiviral activity (e.g., alisporivir, a.k.a. Debio025, for HCV treatment). It remains to be established whether uncoating of other enteroviruses also relies on cyclophilins. Hence, the spectrum of anti-enteroviral activity of cyclophilin inhibitors remains to be explored.",

Other targets for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are host factors, as many host factors are shared by enteroviruses, but a possible downside is the chance of adverse effects and toxicity, as exemplified by PI4KB inhibitors.

(a) The enterovirus genome encodes four structural proteins (VP1-VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D). IRES: internal ribosome entry site. (b) The enterovirus life cycle begins with the attachment of the virus particle to a cellular receptor followed by the internalization of the particle into the host cell. The genome is released and directly translated into a polyprotein, which is processed by virally encoded proteases into the individual viral proteins. Non-structural proteins rewire host cell membranes and generate replication organelles (ROs) for viral RNA replication. Several host proteins, such as PI4KB (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta) and OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein), are recruited to ROs by viral 3A protein, which results in ROs with a unique lipid composition. Genome replication starts with synthesis of complementary negative-stranded RNA, which is used as template for the synthesis of a large number of +RNA molecules. Newly synthesized +RNAs either enter a new round of genome replication or are packaged into capsid proteins to build infectious particles. Viruses are released by a non-lytic mechanism as well as upon cell lysis. Inhibitors of the different stages in the replication cycle are depicted in red.",
