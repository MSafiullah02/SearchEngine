The root of I. indigotica is the well-known Chinese medicine \u201cBanlangen\u201d (Radix Isatidis), which is widely used for flu and infections of the upper respiratory tract in China. During the epidemic period of severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) in 2003, Banlangen demonstrated the potential prevention of SARS [2]. However, the antiviral compounds of I. indigotica were still unknown until Li [3] learned that lariciresinol isolated from this plant was useful for the treatment of influenza A1 virus.",

Ralph and coworkers [16] suggest that the DIR proteins are subdivided into five groups: the DIR-a, DIR-b, DIR-c, DIR-d and DIR-e subfamilies. With the increasing numbers of DIR proteins, the DIR-b and DIR-d subfamilies are combined together with the appearance of the DIR-f and DIR-g subfamilies [17]. However, only members of DIR-a subfamily are being studied for their biochemical functions; the other proteins are referred to as DIR-like proteins. The DIR and DIR-like protein gene family in I. indigotica has not been analyzed in detail yet. Under the umbrella of a transcription profiling of I. indigotica[18], 19 full-length IiDIRs (the dirigent or dirigent-like protein genes of I. indigotica) are mined analytically through bioinformatics. Here we report an inventory and sequence analysis as well as the phylogenetic relationships of the IiDIR gene family. A detailed quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis in constitutive I. indigotica tissues is described for 19 IiDIRs. Finally, we provide a transcriptome analysis of IiDIRs, which is based on data treated with MeJA at different time points.",

For all of the19 queried sequences, the same three top-scoring proteins were found, all of which belong to the allene oxide cyclase-like protein (AOC) family. AOC barrel-like protein d2brja1, which shared only 17\u201326% sequence identity among the IiDIRs, was predicted as a DIR homolog with about 98% probability, followed by two hypothetical proteins with similar probabilities (d1zvca1 and c4h69A, Table 2). Among the highest confidence level predicted by Phyre2, IiDIR14 and IiDIR18 showed the highest confidence of 98.3% respectively with the template d2brja1.",

DIR-e and DIR-b/d subfamilies were mixed with genes from DIR-g subfamily. These DIR-g subfamily genes were all from B. rapa. The phylogenetic tree indicated that IiDIRs cluster into three groups, DIR-a, DIR-b/d and DIR-e (Figure 3). IiDIR1/2/3/4 grouped into subfamily DIR-a, along with 5 A. thaliana genes and 6 B. rapa genes.

Recent studies only focused on the function of the DIR-a subfamily, classifying the other DIRs from the other subfamilies to be the DIR-like proteins. According to Pickel [11, 27], AtDIR5 and AtDIR6 from DIR-a subfamily of A. thaliana were different from those DIRs found earlier, such as FiDIR1 and TpDIR7 [28]. The first DIR from Forsythia suspensa was found to guide E-coniferyl alcohol to form (+)-pinoresinol [12], and many other DIRs had the same function [29]. However, in the presence of AtDIR6, the final product of E-coniferyl alcohol was the enantiomer (\u2212)-pinoresinol. From the topology tree of DIRs from different species (Figure 3), IiDIR2/3/4 were adjacent to AtDIR6, and IiDIR1 was next to AtDIR5. These observations suggested that IiDIR1/2/3/4 might have similar functions with AtDIR6 and AtDIR5.",

This is in agreement with Ralph\u2019s studies [16, 17]. Ralph found subsequently that several sequences from the previous distinct DIR-d cluster were merged with the former DIR-b subfamily to form the new DIR-b/d subfamily and left the rice DIR-like proteins from the former DIR-d subfamily group to be a separate subfamily, DIR-g [17].

This is in accordance with Arasan\u2019s finding in B. rapa DIRs [19]. It is well known that DIR genes are participate in lignin biosynthesis. So the IiDIRs transcript abundance in an organ specific manner in this study suggests that IiDIRs take possible roles in specific organs through lignin formation and participate in I. indigotica\u2019s developmental processes. These organs also share characteristics that make them particularly prone to other stresses and protect themselves against stress attack. To find out IiDIRs transcript abundance in roots at the stress of MeJA, differential expression of IiDIR genes is mined from I. indigotica expression profiling database [18]. It shows that IiDIR8 and IiDIR9 may take part in defense response, because they are nearly not expressed in roots, stems, leaves or flowers, but both of them are up regulated after treatment with MeJA and the regulation lasting till the end of the experiment.",
