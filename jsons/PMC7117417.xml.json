Death losses of sexually mature breeding animals and market hogs add more economic burden to producers. In many situations, both infectious and non-infectious causes can account for reproductive problems and mortality; infectious diseases are considerably more important because of the rapid transmission between animals and many times the lack of effective preventive measures.",

            "text": "Since at least 1995, pork producers and swine practitioners have reported disease outbreaks characterized primarily by early infertility, hence commonly referred to as \u201csow infertility syndrome\u201d or \u201cgrowth depression syndrome\u201d (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Typically, producers have observed an acute decline in farrowing rate due to increased early or delayed returns followed by a prolonged period (up to 2 years) of sub-optimal farrowing performance. Loss of pregnancy most commonly occurs in the early stages of gestation (i.e., 30\u201355 days), although abortion and reproductive failure were reported on sows at later gestations. Affected animals which were confirmed pregnant at 30 days either aborted or demonstrated irregular return to estrus. Besides reproductive disorder, many of the affected animals were presented with neurological signs, such as posterior weakness/paralysis, ataxia, bar chewing, and head pressing/banging (Yoon, 2003). The neurologic symptoms in affected individuals progressed, with death in 2 or 3 days as the usual outcome. Central nervous signs were also observed in younger pigs such as nursery and fattening pigs. To reflect various clinical manifestations, the newly identified disease has also been commonly referred to as \u201cPorcine Reproductive and Neurologic Syndrome (PRNS)\u201d. Reproductive and neurologic problems were not, however, always present simultaneously.",

To date, affected herds have been observed in both PRRSV-infected and PRRSV-free swine herds in many states including Iowa (Yoon, 2003). Although many cases with similar clinical presentations have been presented to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL), a conclusive diagnosis could not be reached to date (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Laboratory testing including serology, has not yet demonstrated the role of any recognized reproductive or neurologic pathogens of swine associated with the symptoms described above, including foreign or exotic viral agents. No bacterial or viral pathogens were consistently identified in index cases. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the condition is toxin-related, or associated with any particular management practice or pig genotype. Therefore, the disease was thought to be due to a previously unrecognized agent. With that hypothesis, the following extensive laboratory diagnostic investigations were conducted to identify the causative agent.",

In brief, confluent monolayer of CL ISUVDL33 and CL ISUVDL99 cells were prepared in 96-well plates and inoculated with virus suspensions (100 \u03bcl/well) which were prepared by a serial 10-fold dilution technique. After 1-hr of absorption at 37 \u00b0C, the virus inoculum was removed and cells replenished with MEM supplemented with 40 or 160 \u03bcg/ml of BUDR (Sigma Chemical Co.) or 2 or 20 \u03bcg/ml of mitomycin C (Sigma Chemical Co.). Plates were incubated for an additional 48 h; virus titer was determined by the presence of visible CPE and then confirmed by IFA staining using rabbit antiserum raised against virus isolate designated ISUYP604671 from a PRNS case. As controls for RNA and DNA viruses, PRRSV and PRV, respectively were concurrently titrated under the same conditions described above.",

Although death loss and reproductive failure in breeding females is not an unusual event in many farms for various reasons, clinical presentations of reproductive problems along with neurologic disorders were a unique feature of PRNS. Unfortunately, diagnostic investigations focusing on all conventional infectious agents that had been implicated in reproductive and/or neurologic problems of pigs at various ages has been unfruitful or yielded inconsistent results. With the hypothesis that a previously unknown infectious agent could be responsible for the disease, extensive laboratory testing resulted in frequent isolation of a relatively small enveloped cytopathic virus (\u2018Virus X\u2019) from clinically affected animals. Although one might say that Virus X is not necessarily a causative pathogen, isolation of the virus from nervous tissues collected from clinically ill animals with CNS signs is a convincing evidence suggesting that Virus X was likely responsible for the disease. Observations from the animal inoculation study with pregnant sows clearly indicate that Virus X is capable of crossing the placental barrier and causing the loss of pregnancy most likely due to embryonic or fetal death as evident by recovery of the virus from fetal tissues. Furthermore, development of meningitis or encephalitis lesions in the brains of young CDCD pigs after inoculation with Virus X also indicate that the virus may be able to cause neurologic disorder in infected animals, although the inoculated CDCD pigs did not show clinical central nervous signs under experimental conditions. Those lesions were due to the attack by Virus X since the virus was recovered from brain tissues. Since all these experimental findings match well with field observations of PRNS, Virus X is postulated to be the causative agent for PRNS as Koch's postulates were partially fulfilled. It is proposed then that Virus X shall be named \u201cPRNS virus (PRNSV)\u201d.",

The positive cross-reactivity of PRNSV with anti-BVDV antibody is of particular interest with respect to taxonomical identification of the virus. The possibility that PRNSV could be CSFV was ruled out at the beginning of the investigation since US swine populations are known to be free of CSFV. Furthermore, diagnostic testing on some early PRNS suspect cases at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory of the National Veterinary Laboratory Service ruled out the presence of CSFV or its infection in those animals as well as the involvement of other foreign animal disease agents (Data not shown). Pigs are known to be susceptible to ruminant pestiviruses such as BVDV and BDV besides porcine pestivirus (i.e., CSFV). Although BVDV infection of pigs has been demonstrated both in the field and under experimental conditions, BVDV has not been considered to be a significant pathogen for pigs. Considering that PRNSV is readily spread among pigs and there is very minimum contact between pigs and ruminants in the US, it would be hard to believe that PRNSV is BVDV or BDV. This argument is supported by negative PCR results (5\u2032 UTR) on isolates of PRNSV for BVDV and CSFV. However, based on its morphological similarity with pestiviruses and cross-reactivity with anti-BVDV antibody, the possibility that PRNSV is a pestivirus cannot be completely ruled out until proven otherwise. At the time of writing this manuscript, PRNSV is proposed to be a novel swine pestivirus which remains to be further characterized for its conclusive taxonomical identification. As a pestivirus is suspected to be responsible for PRNS, development of a specific diagnostic reagent for PRNSV is prudent.",
