The majority of evidence for the diagnosis and management ARDS, however, has stemmed from research conducted in high-income countries.

These include differences in resources available in the ICU such as health care providers [17], equipment [18], and health care dollars spent per capita [19]. Since being on mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher mortality in LMICs [20], a better characterization of ARDS among mechanically ventilated patients in low-resource settings can help guide changes in critical care delivery. For example, a single-center study by Li et al. reported that changes in critical care structure and delivery were temporally associated with a decrease in the incidence of hospital-acquired ARDS with no change in incidence of ARDS on presentation over an 8-year period [21]. As such, it is crucial to understand risk factors for nosocomial ARDS as a step towards prevention of this condition.",

Consequently, we evaluated for differences in etiology, clinical characteristics, mechanical ventilation management, and associated morbidity and mortality in these two groups of patients with ARDS. We also evaluated risk factors for the development of ARDS among those who did not have ARDS at mechanical ventilation onset. With this information, we aimed to identify a high-risk population, health care practices, or factors that help to identify participants who develop ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset while in the ICU.",

Based on these findings, we tested if tidal volumes at the initiation of mechanical ventilation varied with BMI and predicted body weight. In these analyses, however, we found that tidal volumes at the initiation of mechanical ventilation were not associated with BMI but were positively associated with predicted body weight (Additional file 1: Fig. S3).\n",

We also observed that the majority of study participants were ventilated with > 6 mL/kg PBW. Indeed, the mean tidal volume for patients with ARDS at mechanical ventilation onset was 8.7 mL/kg PBW. This is not in compliance with the ARDS Network trial recommendations of lung-protective ventilation with a tidal volume of \u2264 6 mL/kg predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of H2O [37] and highlights an area for improvement. In routine clinical practice, however, non-compliance with ARDS Network ventilation protocols has also been commonly reported in studies conducted in the USA. For example, an observational study conducted in 57 ICUs in the USA found a compliance of 50% with tidal volumes \u2264 6.5 mL/kg PBW in patients with ARDS [38].

This can be due to less than optimal lung recruitment, i.e., inadequate application of PEEP. The average set PEEP in this cohort of mechanically ventilated patients was 7.7 cm H2O. Although PEEP was higher in those with ARDS on presentation, higher levels of PEEP may actually be needed given high driving pressures. Lower driving pressure, irrespective of tidal volume, is associated with lower mortality in ARDS [40]. Therefore, individualized titration of PEEP through measurement of driving pressure and plateau pressure may improve clinical outcomes [41]. This along with low tidal volume ventilation can facilitate achieving lower driving pressures. While driving pressure at the initiation of mechanical ventilation was not associated with the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset in our study, it is a known predictor of mortality in ARDS [29, 42].",

Among the ventilator-related risk factors, higher mean airway pressures, higher peak airway pressures, and higher set PEEP at the initiation of mechanical ventilation were all associated with a higher incidence of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset in adjusted analyses. The association between higher airway pressures (peak, mean airway, and PEEP) and ARDS development could reflect lung injury, but it could also reflect less-compliant lungs that are sicker and more prone to ARDS development. Indeed, high airway pressures have been linked with early barotrauma and higher mortality [43]. In fact, peak inspiratory airway pressure was also identified to be a potential target to lower mortality in an ancillary analysis from the LUNG SAFE study [43]. High inspiratory flow, for a given plateau pressure or strain, may contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury likely by locally intensified concentration of stress [44, 45]. Higher mean airway pressures may also reflect patients with higher airway resistance, lower compliance, and more elevated respiratory rates which could reflect a greater dead space, all of which can identify a group of sicker patients who are more likely to get ARDS. Mean airway pressure reflects mean alveolar pressure throughout an entire respiratory cycle, which may better reflect the power applied to the lung and risk for injury throughout tidal breathing. Targeting peak or mean airway pressures, therefore, may play a role in preventing ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset.",

            "text": "In contrast, we did not find an association between the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset and either plateau pressures or driving pressures at the initiation of mechanical ventilation, two well-described predictors of ARDS mortality. Nonetheless, both plateau pressure and driving pressure at the initiation of mechanical ventilation were higher in patients with ARDS at the start of mechanical when compared to those who developed ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset or never developed ARDS. There are a couple of possibilities that may explain why we did not find an association between the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset and either plateau of driving pressures at the initiation of mechanical ventilation. First, plateau or driving pressure may take longer to rise in relation to the time of onset of ARDS compared to peak or mean airway pressure. Therefore, plateau or driving pressures measured at the initiation of mechanical ventilation may not capture this relationship. Mean or peak airway pressures may be elevated earlier than plateau or driving pressures in patients who go on to develop ARDS later in the course of mechanical ventilation because physicians may set a higher inspiratory flow rate in response to compensatory tachypnea commonly observed in mechanically ventilated patients with metabolic acidosis resulting from sepsis or septic shock, pancreatitis, or trauma, all of which are well-known risk factors for ARDS. A set higher inspiratory flow rate will result in higher peak airway pressures whereas plateau or driving pressures are minimally affected [46]. Patients with sepsis may also have circulatory inflammatory mediators which causes bronchoconstriction and consequently higher airway resistance [47\u201349]. This also results in higher peak airway pressures whereas plateau or driving pressures are minimally affected. Patients may also have pulmonary edema that precedes radiographic changes before it causes flooding of alveoli, but which affects conducting airways and increases airway resistance [50]. Second, we had fewer measurements of plateau or driving pressures when compared to peak or mean airway pressure which could have affected our ability to measure a statistically significant difference. We may have had fewer measurements of plateau pressure or driving pressure because they can be cumbersome or difficult to achieve, as it requires a half second inspiratory hold on a ventilator to calculate driving pressure. In our study, nearly 30% (480) of the patients were missing a plateau pressure recording at the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Similarly, in the multinational LUNG SAFE study, plateau pressure was available in only 40% of patients with ARDS, again showing a deficiency of measurement of plateau pressure worldwide in the management of ARDS [29]. It is well established from clinical and animal studies that presumptive application of protective ventilation with low tidal volume to keep plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O can reduce the incidence of ARDS [51, 52].",

However, it was associated with a statistically significant difference between actual and predicted body weight. This suggests that excess adipose tissue in obese individuals may predispose them to an elevated risk for developing ARDS. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this association in previously published studies like obesity-induced adipokine imbalance [53], obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress-causing endothelium dysfunction [54], chronic inflammatory state of obesity, and elevated neutrophils and cytokines that induce upregulation of adhesion molecules on lung epithelium and enhanced susceptibility to injury [55].

First, both higher airway pressure at mechanical ventilation onset and subsequent development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset could reflect an underlying severe lung injury rather than a causal effect. Regardless, they serve as an indicator of the development of ARDS in the future, in a cohort of patients who initially do not meet the criterion for ARDS and hence provide an opportunity for early intervention. In addition, the association was adjusted for baseline severity of illness score APACHE III accounting for some of the disease severity at presentation. Second, our study was designed before the publication of the Berlin definition, but the collection of necessary information allowed for the addition of parameters like PEEP to the existing definition to make the criteria more aligned with the Berlin definition. Third, we did not have information about the potential etiology of injury that could have led to the development of ARDS. This precluded us from calculating a Lung Injury Prevention Score (LIPS) at baseline which has been studied to identify those at risk for acute lung injury [56]. Choosing mechanically ventilated participants helped us to enrich our cohort with individuals who are at the highest risk of developing ARDS and enabled us to isolate iatrogenic risk factors in mechanically ventilated individuals. Overall, the observational design allowed us to study current practices and incidence of disease and identify gaps and areas of improvement. Fourth, because this is an observational study, we did not dictate how frequently physicians obtained chest X-rays or arterial blood gases while on mechanical ventilation. This may result in an underestimation of the ARDS incidence after mechanical ventilation onset. Finally, our study was conducted between 2010 and 2013, and changes in the management of sepsis and mechanical ventilation could affect how our findings are applicable today. Replication of our findings in more recent cohorts is necessary.",

Risk factors for the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset include a high body mass index and the presence of high airway pressures (peak, mean airway, and positive end-expiratory pressures) early in the course of mechanical ventilation. Future studies need to validate the use of these early factors to identify mechanically ventilated patients at risk for developing ARDS after initiation of mechanical ventilation.",
