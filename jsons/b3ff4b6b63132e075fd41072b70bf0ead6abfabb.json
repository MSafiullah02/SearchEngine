The population was enriched with subjects with multiple co-morbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard of care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range: 42-79 years), and patients carried a median of one co-morbid condition (0-2); two out of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 presentation, and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of cancer patients to treatments, prioritizing the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value, and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including in clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the Global Response Agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.",

The rapid adoption of non-pharmacological public health interventions, such as social distancing and lockdown measures, has driven the initial response to an unprecedent extent for the national health system. The national capacity of Italy's health system has traditionally been regarded as an excellent model for a public health service, ensuring effective coverage for all, with 3.12 hospital beds per 1000 people and 3.99 physicians per 1000 inhabitants [2]; the system has been able to deliver efficient and effective healthcare, favoring the country in terms of productivity [3] . However, no health system can be truly prepared or sufficiently flexible for an impressive rise in the demand for intensive care capacity, especially if funded on vertical disease programs. An academic health model anticipated complete saturation of the number of available beds in intensive care units by March 14th, 2020, prompting an inter-sectorial approach that could clearly estimate and communicate the risk for severe COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care [4] . Such an approach broadens the chances for all to access the appropriate treatments, while the daily rate of new COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization was slowing down.",

As the pandemic rapidly escalated, the Italian Government enforced a state of emergency on a national scale [7] . Furthermore, the regional organs of governance and the emergency regulations emphasized the need to ensure essential care for cancer patients, a potentially frailer fringe of the population, exposed to both a higher risk of COVID-19 and fatal consequences [8, 9] . The bedrock for priority setting in oncology care is structured in value-based health system planning.

No recurrent pattern of cancer type (per histology) or setting of care (neo/adjuvant or palliative) was identified; three patients were receiving active treatment in the curative setting and five were receiving treatment for metastatic disease, all received within 14 days at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Chemotherapy was the most common ongoing therapy (n = 4), followed by experimental immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 2) and small molecules (n = 2). Possibly related to the inclusion in clinical trials, multiple NCD comorbidities were uncommon in the overall population, with a median of one comorbidity per patient (range: 0-2), represented by arterial hypertension (n = 4), diabetes mellitus type II (n = 2) and chronic kidney diseases (n = 1). Using the criteria to score SARS-CoV-2 infection proposed by the Italian Association of Anesthesiology, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI), we scored the COVID-19 severity in six stages-from stage I (non-complicated COVID-19, no pulmonary findings) to stage VI (septic shock)-and referred to stage 2 pneumonias as mild and stage 3 as severe. None of our patients accessed the intensive therapy unit; two had severe pneumonia and were hospitalized. All the other patients had a mild COVID-19 syndrome and were referred to home-based management, according to the local practice and clinical indications. For patients managed at home, a telemedicine system intended to connect doctors and nurses on a daily basis has been established, engaging with the primary health providers, and enhanced by the home delivery of territorial volunteers, community workers and nurses for specific tasks: registering vital parameters twice daily along with documentation of the patients' symptoms.",

In this study, cancer history represented the strongest single prognostic factor for severe events in COVID-19 (odd ratio: 5.399), more than age and the presence of other NCDs.

We report a mixed cohort of patients with diverse histology types and settings of care. While the previous studies seemed to be augmented with some cancer patients, like smoke-related malignancies, lung cancer diagnosis could itself represent a possible risk factor for severe outcomes from the infection, as observed in single case reports and case series. One of the two patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in our study is a patient with oncogene-addicted lung cancer and no comorbidities, receiving a targeted therapy. Of interest, the age range of our population falls halfway between the national median age for COVID-19 diagnosis and death. So far, we have observed no death from COVID-19 in our patients, and all the standard protocols for homebased management and regional criteria for hospitalization have been strictly followed.",

The questions of the medical oncology for the correct approach in the management of COVID-19 are still multiple and unresolved, in the absence of data; questions include whether there is a need to stop certain types of treatments, and whether there is a risk of impairing outcome when continuing some medications with immune-regulating properties (both suppressing and stimulating).
