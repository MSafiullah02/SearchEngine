However, these vaccines provide complete clinical protection of the animals at least 7 days after vaccination.4 In addition, these emergency vaccines are serotype and subtype specific, and as a result, their using often requires specific diagnostic tests to distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated animals.5 An alternative strategy that can be used is to use an immunomodulatory or antiviral molecules to induce immediate and serotype nonspecific protection of the animal under FMDV infection.6\n",

This process relies on the cellular translational machinery, thus, inhibition of protein translation process may become a new antiviral therapeutic strategy to control infection. To date, a number of compounds including silvestrol,7 hippuristanol,8 rocaglamide,9 elisabatin, and allolaurintenol10 have been identified to have a specific effect on inhibiting the translation process. Homoharringtonine is known to inhibit the first cycle of the elongation phase of eukaryotic translation.11, 12 Homoharringtonine was used in China for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other types of tumor diseases for the past 30 years.13 Besides that, homoharringtonine was reported to exhibit antiviral activity, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), chikungunya virus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus, varicella\u2010zoster virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV\u20101), and pseudorabies virus (PRV).14, 15, 16, 17, 18 All of these characteristics make homoharringtonine an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic, but its activity against FMDV remains unexplored. In the current study, the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV replication in IBRS\u20102 cells was demonstrated. Also, this study investigated potential mechanisms by which the homoharringtonine could exert its antiviral effects and provided preliminary evidence for its possible use as an antiviral agent during the early stage of viral infection.",

After the FMDVs entered the IBRS\u20102 cells, cells were treated with 12.5\u03bcM homoharringtonine at different times post infection. The viral levels were determined after the IBRS\u20102 cells at 24 hours post infection. The viral 2B mRNA and VP1 protein levels were remarkably decreased after addition of the drug at 0, 2, 4, and 8 hours post infection, but no further significant reductions occurred at 16 hours post infection, compared with viral mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in the nontreated group (Figure 7A and 7B). These results indicated that homoharringtonine inhibited FMDV infection by targeting early stages of viral replication.",

            "text": "In recent years, medicinal plants have been aroused increasing attention used to treat various infectious diseases. Previously it has been shown that homoharringtonine had an antiviral effect on several RNA virus. However, inhibition was not previously reported in FMDV. This study initially investigated whether homoharringtonine could be used as a potential antiviral agent for FMDV. First, homoharringtonine, within a certain range of concentrations, had no significant toxicity in IBRS\u20102 cells (Figure 2) or significant effects on cell morphology (data no shown). After homoharringtonine treatment, the viral DNA and viral protein levels were strongly inhibited in a dose\u2010dependent manner, as confirmed by q\u2010PCR, Western Blot, and IFA assays. These results supported that homoharringtonine inhibited FMDV infection of IBRS\u20102 cells. Generally, the viral life contains several stages, such as the attachment to cells, entry into cells, and replication in the nucleus. Among them, viral attaches to specific receptors on cells consists of the initial step for the viral life cycle, while, the attachment step is important for virus host tropism. These stages of the viral life cycle were investigated after homoharringtonine treatment in the present study. We observed that viral attachment and entry were not affected by the treatment of homoharringtonine. Time\u2010of\u2010addition studies were also performed to identify the window in the FMDV replication cycle when homoharringtonine exhibited its antiviral effect. Our study revealed that homoharringtonine remained potent when added at post infection from 0 hours to 8 hours post infection, indicating that the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV replication occurred primarily at the early stages. Similar result was also obtained from the study of Dong et al,17 in their study, they found that homoharringtonine play its roles in the viral replication cycle after viral entry.",

In this study, we found that homoharringtonine exerts antiviral activity against FMDV, a porcine Picornaviridae, including two different strains of FMDV. Therefore, this study broadened our understanding of the characteristics of its antiviral activity. Further study is needed to investigate the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV infections in vivo.",
