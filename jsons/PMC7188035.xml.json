The mechanisms of the outbreak are not yet fully clear but the responsible novel zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has high transmissibility.1 COVID-19 is mainly spread by exposure to respiratory droplets from nearby infected persons. These then get into mucosal membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth, either directly or indirectly, e.g. via touching one\u2019s face with a contaminated hand.",

Most infected persons will have a mild illness and some actually remain asymptomatic. However, 15-20% of those infected will have a severe illness with 5-10% requiring critical care. The mortality rate varies depending on local factors and is about 2%, i.e. about 10 time higher than regular seasonal influenza infections. Older adults and those with pre-existing medical illnesses (e.g. diabetes, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease) are at greatest risk of death from COVID-19 with a mortality of around 10%. Interestingly, children are much less susceptible to COVID-19 than adults.",

Hand-washing, respiratory etiquette, social/physical distancing, self-isolation, case detection, contact tracing, quarantining and travel bans are all essential measures to reduce risk of infection and rates of community transmission.2 Health care workers are at higher risk of exposure due to close contact with infected persons who may be symptomatic or even asymptomatic. When indicated, use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is therefore a key component in mitigating this risk in order to maintain the safety of health care workers, prevent depletion of the health care workforce, and reduce community spread of COVID-19.",

Local protocols should be based on national and international best practice guidance and will also need to include protocols for safe and supervised donning and doffing of PPE. Unfortunately, because of unprecedented demand, PPE gear is becoming a scarce resource and this needs to be factored into clinical decision-making processes, keeping in mind healthcare disparity between countries with high, middle and low incomes.",
