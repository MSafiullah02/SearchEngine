            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening contagious disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Since the first SARS case emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002, the disease has affected over 8000 victims in 31 countries and devitalized near 1000 lives (Schlagenhauf and Ashraf, 2003). To date, no specific, effective medicine or vaccine has been developed against SARS (Berger et al., 2004), which is currently treated with heteropathy and/or conservative therapeutics. Although the first SARS outbreak was controlled by the mains of quarantine, WHO's reports in 2004 (http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/docs/update/update_07022004_revisedfinal.asp and http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/docs/pressreleases/pr_31012004.asp) indicated that SARS remains a constant threat to public. Efforts to develop safe, efficient SARS vaccines are under way worldwide (Marshall and Enserink, 2004). It is, thus, important to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV. An inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine seems to be the most facile and convenient option, but inactivated vaccines have been associated with risks of infection. For example, monkey models and children immunized with inactivated measles virus vaccine may develop severe cases of atypical measles (Polack et al., 1999, Fulginiti et al., 1967). Therefore, developing a gene-based vaccine may be a more promising choice.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome is a single strand RNA molecule encoding four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Rota et al., 2003). S protein contains two subunits, S1 and S2. S1 is responsible for recognizing and binding to receptors on host cells, while S2 directs fusion between the viral and cell membranes (Ingallinella et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004a). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003b), and the receptor-binding region of spike was defined as amino acid residues 318\u2013510 of the S1 subunit (Wong et al., 2004). Both soluble ACE2 receptor and mAb to S1 subunit can interfere receptor association and block SARS-CoV infection (Hofmann et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004). Presumably, a vaccine designed to interfere with the binding between the S protein and its receptor on host cells would also prevent the spread of SARS. Buchholz et al. (2004) reported that S glycoprotein, of the structural proteins, appears to act as the only significant SARS-CoV neutralization antigen in a hamster model. A human mAb to S1 subunit was found to neutralize SARS coronavirus by blocking receptor association (Sui et al., 2004). Moreover, previous studies concerning the development of vaccines against animal coronaviruses have suggested that the S1 subunit contains neutralizing epitopes that confer protection to animals (e.g., birds and pigs) upon viral challenge (Cavanagh, 2003, Correa et al., 1990, Delmas et al., 1990, Song et al., 1998).",

However, they almost lack safety evaluation. Weingartl et al. (2004) reported recently that immunization with modified vaccinia virus expressing full-length spike (S) protein of SARS virus was associated with enhanced hepatitis, while developed a more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response. S protein was presumed that induced strong inflammatory responses in ferret liver tissue. In this study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus expressing a shorter, truncated S1 subunit of SARS-CoV (Ad-SN), and investigated its ability to induce humoral immunity against SARS-CoV and its safety in rats. Our study demonstrated that high titer antibodies against SARS-CoV were elicited in a rat model following both subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) administration of Ad-SN, the latter of which is targeted at fostering the respiratory mucosal immunity for protection against airborne diseases such as SARS. This result indicates that our construct could be developed into a safe SARS-CoV vaccine.",

Both of the two viruses were propagated in 293 cells, purified by CsCl-banding and titered with the Adeno-X\u2122 rapid titer kit (BD Biosciences, Inc.) (Eykholt et al., 2000). The prepared recombinant adenoviruses were monitored to prevent from contamination of bacterium, fungus, mycoplasma, wild type adenovirus and other viruses.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that several antigenic epitopes on the spike protein are recognized by sera from convalescent SARS patients and are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in humans (Hua et al., 2004, Guo et al., 2004). Spike protein or its S1 subunit have been reported that can induce efficient immunity against SARS-CoV and protect from the attack of SARS-CoV in animal models (Yang et al., 2004b, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Gao et al., 2003). In this study, we demonstrated that a truncated S1 subunit of spike protein (490 N-terminal amino-acid residues) could induce a strong humoral immune response against SARS-CoV in rats (Fig. 3A and B), and the sera from Ad-SN-immunized rats could effectively protect Vero-E6 cells against SARS-CoV (BJ01 isolate) infection in vitro (Fig. 3C). No evident pathological changes (e.g., inflammatory response) were observed in various tissues (including lung, liver, colon, heart, brain, spleen, kidney, etc.) of Ad-SN-immunized animals (data not shown), contrast to the finding of Weingartl et al. that immunization with modified vaccinia virus expressing the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein exhibited strong inflammatory responses in liver tissue in ferrets (Weingartl et al., 2004). This difference may be due to the difference of experimental animals, protocols and Spike gene fragments that vectors carried. Our present data cannot conclusively demonstrate whether truncated S1 gene vaccine will be a safer vaccine candidate. However, it can be presumed that truncated S1 gene carries less risk for spontaneous recombination with wild type virus to generate new virus types. Considering these favorites, truncated S1 subunit gene vaccine could be a safer vaccine candidate than the full-length Spike gene and may act as a pharmacologically active vaccine.",

Previous work has shown that immunization via the respiratory tract (i.e. intranasal) could induce protective mucosal immunity (Sakaue et al., 2003, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Xiang and Ertl, 1999). As respiratory epithelial cells are the natural hosts for adenovirus, recombinant adenovirus Ad-SN immunized through the respiratory tract should induce mucosal immunity as a first line of defense against viral attack. This is particularly important for SARS, which mainly spread through the respiratory tract. In this study, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-specific antibodies and neutralizing activities could be induced by intranasal immunization at the same serum level as that elicted by subcutaneous immunization (Fig. 3A and C). This indicates that recombinant adenovirus encoding truncated S1 subunit is a good candidate for development as a mucosal SARS-CoV vaccine.",

It is necessary to make clear whether Ad-SN can elicit T-cell immunity in rats. Comprehensive examinations of the associated immunological parameters will be further needed to evaluate the benefits of the various immunization strategies. In addition, the rat model may not faithfully replicate the immunological characteristics of humans. It will be necessary to test potential SARS vaccine candidates for their immunogenicity, safety and efficacy in other animal models, such as rabbit, primates, raccoons, dog and human.",
