            "text": "The novel coronavirus, which had initially led to pneumonia of unknown etiology in a series of patients in China's Hubei province in December 2019, has now precipitated a global health crisis (1) . With the number of infected individuals rising across the globe, identification of effective therapeutic strategies and management of their potential side effects has become of paramount importance. In the absence of solid evidence based on randomized controlled trials supporting a specific treatment, many healthcare professionals have resorted to the off-label use of different medications with a wide range of side effects. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), and azithromycin are among these medications with anecdotal reports supporting their effectiveness in the treatment of this infection. However, all three of these medications are known to cause QT interval prolongation and therefore increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (2) (3) (4) . Furthermore, stress, fever, and electrolyte disturbance can make these individuals prone to arrhythmia. Abnormalities in potassium and magnesium levels are known to affect the QT interval (5) . Therefore, effective countermeasures to manage QTc prolonging effects of the treatments used in patients with COVID-19 infection could play a substantial role in the final outcome of the disease.",

On admission, baseline QTc assessment was done and at the same time treatment for COVID-19 was initiated unless QTc \u2265 460 ms. QTc was calculated using Bazett's formula. The mean\u00b1SD pretreatment QTc was 417\u00b122 ms. At the same time baseline values for potassium and magnesium were measured and monitored in addition to providing supplementary doses of these electrolytes throughout the treatment in order to keep their levels above the mentioned thresholds suggested by the national protocol for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. The QTc intervals were assessed every other day in order to monitor for QT prolongation. After a week of treatment, the QTc increased by an average of 14 (95% CI -7 to 35) ms, which was not statistically significant (Fig 1) . There was no incidence of arrhythmia or sudden cardiac arrest among the studied individuals.",
