            "text": "Infections with enteric viruses are thought to play a significant role as an aetiological agent of acute enteritis in dogs. Among the viral species commonly detected in dogs with diarrhoea are canine parvoviruses (CPVs), canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PVs). Rotaviruses, caliciviruses and not further classified virus particles have also been described (Hammond and Timoney 1991, 1985, 1995, 1983, 2001, 2005, 1995). Prevalence of enteric viruses in dogs with diarrhoea seems to depend on age of dogs investigated, as well as on vaccination status of affected dogs; however, environmental factors are also thought to play an important role. High prevalences of CPV and CCoV were detected in faecal samples of dogs with diarrhoea from animal shelters, indicating the influence of hygiene and infection pressure (Stann and others 2005, 1984, 1993). Furthermore, geographic differences may play a role in prevalence of enteric viruses in canine gastrointestinal disease.",

While shedding of CPV seems to be associated with clinical signs of gastroenteritis, CCoV can be detected in healthy dogs without signs of gastrointestinal disease (Tennant and others 1994, 2005, 1993). Antibody prevalence against CCoV is high in dogs from animal shelters and breeding colonies in different geographic regions (Tennant and others 2001b, 1993, 2004). However, there are studies suggesting a significant role for CCoV in acute diarrhoea in dogs (Tennant and others 1993, 2004).",

Or if they are an incidental finding of non\u2010pathogenic organisms simply being shed by animals with diarrhoea as a result of another aetiology. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further investigate this question by evaluating privately owned pet dogs in Southern Germany and to compare viral prevalences in healthy dogs and in dogs with AHD in the same geographic region.",

These data clearly suggest that shedding of CPV is associated with clinical disease. This assumption is underlined by the results of other studies in which CPV could not be detected in the faeces of healthy dogs (Stann and others 2003, 2005, 1984). The only dog shedding CPV in this study was a one\u2010year\u2010old male hunting dog that had been adopted from a shelter six weeks earlier and since then had not displayed any gastrointestinal signs. A possible explanation could be a recent natural CPV infection before adoption because some naturally infected dogs have been shown to shed virus for up to 46 days after occurrence of first clinical signs (Decaro and others 2005). Also, the dog could have ingested CPV contaminated faecal material leading to enteric passage of the virus without systemic infection. This could, for example, happen if the dog is protected by parvovirus vaccination against development of clinical signs but not against infection, thus leading to virus shedding in an asymptomatic animal, as described for puppies shedding CPV despite presence of maternal antibody titres considered sufficiently high for protection (Elia and others 2005). The dog was fully vaccinated according to the owner.",

CCoV was detected in 17\u00b75 per cent of healthy dogs and only in 11\u00b76 per cent of dogs with AHD, thus questioning the role of CCoV as a primary intestinal pathogen in dogs. The prevalence of CCoV in dogs with AHD is comparable with older German studies, which examined the faecal samples from dogs with diarrhoea by EM, but so far no information is available about the prevalence of this virus in healthy dogs in Southern Germany. Studies performed in Europe and northern America showed high antibody prevalences of CCoV in up to 59 per cent of healthy dogs from animal shelters (Tennant and others 2005, 1993). A study performed by Tennant and others (1993) failed to detect CCoV in the faeces of healthy pet dogs in England.",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the high number of healthy dogs shedding CCoV in this study. CCoV belongs to one of three groups of the genus Coronavirus and is genetically closely related to feline coronavirus (FCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. Because of the high error frequencies of the RNA polymerase, coronaviruses are prone to rapidly develop point mutations in coding and non\u2010coding sequences, thus resulting in proliferation of different strains, serotypes and subtypes of the virus (Dolja and Carrington 1992). At least two distinct genetic clusters of CCoV can be identified in naturally infected dogs. Type I CCoV is classified as being genetically closely related to FCoV and type II as representing the \u201ctypical\u201d CCoV (Pratelli and others 2003), with both genotypes frequently being harboured by one dog (Pratelli and others 2004). Because of the broad genetic variability and fast rate of recombination, even specific strains seem to develop within several weeks in the dog population of animal shelters (Benetka and others 2006). Thus, dogs can be continuously re\u2010infected with new virus variants exhibiting a broad range of antigenic and genetic variability, potentially evading the host\u2019s immune response. This might be an explanation why, as is known for FCoV in cats, dogs are also suspected to become persistently infected with CCoV. Dogs were found to shed CCoV for up to 156 days after natural infection, and the virus strains involved underwent several mutations during that period (Pratelli and others 2002). A persistent infection could therefore also explain the shedding of CCoV in the healthy dogs in this study. Follow\u2010up faecal examinations and genetic sequencing would be interesting options in these patients to assess duration of shedding and strains involved. Because of the wide genetic variation of CCoV, different strains are also thought to have different characteristics concerning pathogenicity and virulence factors, possibly being responsible for variation of clinical signs associated with CCoV infection. Some strains seem to cause severe clinical signs of AHD predominantly in very young dogs (Pratelli and others 2006, 2005, 2003), especially in cases of dual infection with other viral species 1999, 2001). Although healthy dogs shedding CCoV were shown to be significantly younger than virus\u2010negative dogs in this study, this difference in age could not be demonstrated for the patients with AHD. Therefore, it could be assumed that healthy young dogs are more likely to serve as hosts and carriers for CCoV, but other factors are probably necessary to cause clinical disease related to CCoV infection.",

Another factor that could not be investigated in this study was the immune system of the dogs. In a recent study investigating host immune response after oral or parenteral inoculation of CCoV field or vaccine strains, Decaro and others (2004b) found significantly higher CCoV\u2010specific faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies in dogs orally infected with CCoV live\u2010vaccine and in naturally infected dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate if CCoV\u2010specific faecal IgA as part of the immune response correlates with grade of protection.",

Little information is available about the role of PV in healthy dogs, but data from this study suggest a strong association of PV infection with clinical disease. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an important PV, and while earlier studies described respiratory and neurological signs in combination with enteritis in dogs infected with CDV, results from this study suggest that CDV might be involved in the aetiology of AHD without affecting other organ systems (Decaro and others 2004a).

One of the advantages of this diagnostic tool is the possibility to detect different viral species in one faecal sample in one diagnostic procedure and to evaluate the samples for concomitant infection with more than one virus. The disadvantages of this method are an implied relatively high cost, lack of quantitative results and a lower sensitivity and specificity compared with PCR assays (Schunck and others 2000, 1995). New PCR methods have been proven to be up to 4\u00d7104 times more sensitive than EM and virus isolation for detection of CCoV, thus being able to detect virus also in the faeces of low\u2010grade shedding animals below 106 particles per gram of unprocessed faeces, which is considered the detection limit for EM (Naylor and others 2001a). Because of the lower sensitivity of EM, the prevalence of enteric viruses might have been underestimated in this study, and at the same time, the prevalence of virus\u2010negative animals might have been overestimated. In future studies investigating enteric viruses in the Southern German dog population, strain differentiation, especially concerning CCoV, would be desirable to obtain more information about its strain\u2010associated pathogenicity and clinical characteristics.",
