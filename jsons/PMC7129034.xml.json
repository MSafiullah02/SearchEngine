To identify the minimum size of the tag, peptide sequences were truncated by one or more amino acids. Truncation of a single amino acid at the C-terminus only minimally affected binding of the mAb 8G7. Any further deletion regardless from which terminus of the sequence significantly reduced protein recognition. Similarly, cutting a single amino acid from the C-terminal end of the 2G8 epitope abolished recognition of the protein. Truncation from the N-terminal side of the epitope sequence likewise drastically reduced affinity of the mAb 2G8. Thus, the optimal peptide size for use as protein tags consists of the nine amino acid sequence GNSRNSTPG for mAb 8G7 and the ten amino acid sequence KKKKTDEAQP for the mAb 2G8 (Fig. 2).",

For instance, the yield from 1.3 mg total protein of an E. coli lysate was 0.185 mg 8G7 epitope-tagged protein.
