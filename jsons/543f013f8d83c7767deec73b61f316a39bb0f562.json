There have been significant problems with leaders and citizenry deliberately ignoring and not complying with such measures and which have directly resulted in sudden rises in infection numbers. Here, I show the nature and extent of the widespread problem and argue that the problem is in large part due to our modern society characterised by liberal individualism. I apply the philosophy proposed by philosopher Alasdair MacIntrye to show that one key underlying cause of the noncompliant behaviour of citizenry is due to modern liberal individualism that has deprived the modern nation state of the opportunities and authority for it to teach or to dictate what is the common good of the society as a whole to individuals in its community. This is the first time MacIntyre's philosophy has been applied to public health, and this paper demonstrates the need for ethics education to counter-balance liberal individualism in order to contain and to prevent another pandemic and public health crisis in modern society.",

The first community transmission seemed to have been confirmed on 20 February 2020, and the patient had led an active life even when he had symptoms and was obviously contagious (Horowitz et al. 2020 ). This should have sounded alarm bells for the Italian authorities; instead, on 27 February 2020, the leader of the governing Democratic Party Nicola Zingaretti urged people \"not to change our habits\" and posted a picture of himself clinking glasses for \"an aperitivo in Milan\" (Horowitz et al. 2020) . Less than 10 days later in early March 2020, Italy had 5883 confirmed cases and 233 deaths (Horowitz et al. 2020) , and it was reported that on 21 March 2020, there were 793 deaths, a one-day record that saw the country's death toll increase to 4825 with the total number of confirmed cases of in Italy standing at 53,578 on 21 March 2020 (Channel News Asia 2020). On 27 March 2020, 1 month after Zingaretti's online post, the number of confirmed cases in Italy stood at 86,498 with 9134 deaths (Washington Post 2020).",

By 10 March, there were nearly 7400 cases, and the lockdown was extended to the whole of Italy with limits on travel abroad and across regions.

Spain had 589 confirmed cases at that point. Around 120,000 people gathered for the event in Madrid, and by the next day, the number of confirmed cases had doubled, very likely due to the mass gathering. On 15 March, Sanchez ordered a national lockdown, but it may have been too late-in the 10 days after, Spain's number of confirmed cases rose from 9000 to 50,000 (Sills and Lombrana 2020) .",

            "text": "In Australia, another country that has been slow to implement effective infectious disease control measures such as lockdown, its beaches in Sydney were crowded with thousands of people on 21 March 2020, even when social distancing measures and restrictions on public gatherings were already in place. One beachgoer told the reporter \"You can't stop people from living. That's the way I look at it. If it's a nice day and I want to have a run and a swim, well I'm gonna go do it\" with other beachgoers expressing the same sentiments (Taylor 2020) . After the lifesavers on patrol at the beaches were harassed by beachgoers, the police moved to close all the beaches to implement the restrictions on mass public gatherings. Even after the beaches were closed, members of the public were still defiant and continued to head towards the beaches, making their way past barricades that had been set up (Pengilley and Thomas 2020) . At that point in time, the state of New South Wales where Sydney is situated already had the highest number of cases in Australia with over 500 confirmed cases that had increased exponentially over the previous days and week (Pengilley and Thomas 2020) . Finally, after the events at the beaches, on 22 March 2020, the state government announced that the state would go into lockdown by 24 March 2020 except for essential services, which strangely included not just supermarkets and petrol stations, but also hairdressers and beauticians, liquor stores and schools (Drevikovsky et al. 2020 ). However, 1 week later on 27 March, the number of confirmed cases in New South Wales had tripled to 1617, with many cases directly attributable to the beachgoers based on geographical location and movement tracing. Desperate to contain the spiralling number of infections, the Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on 27 March that all returning travellers from overseas would be isolated for 14 days in hotels at the expense of taxpayers (Gladstone and Chung 2020) . Even so, a group of 33 medical professionals out of a group of 77, returning from Chile, disobeyed police orders to be quarantined at an airport hotel and instead headed to the domestic airport terminal to fly home (Fitzsimmons 2020) .",

In the US, party-goers in New Orleans and Nashville were highly criticised for not abiding by the restrictions (Aguilera 2020), as were partying college students in Florida (BBC News 2020b). Even more alarming, from the middle of April 2020 onwards, many demonstrators in some US states blatantly ignored the lockdowns and the safe distancing measures in place and came out in force in the streets, some carrying guns and automatic weapons making their way into a Capitol building and attempted to enter the floor of the in-session legislative chamber (Beckett 2020) , to protest the lockdowns and stay home orders (Dartunorro 2020 ). These protesters in over a dozen states (BBC News 2020a) across the US such as in Maryland, New Hampshire, Texas, Indiana, Nevada, Wisconsin, Ohio and California relied on claims of their supposed Constitutional rights not to be in lockdown (Straits Times 2020), whilst in some cities such as Denver, a few healthcare workers braved the protestors to stage their counter-protest by blocking the anti-lockdown demonstrations (Hutchinson 2020) . Even as these protests were taking place on 21 April 2020, the US had 761,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths (BBC News 2020a).

We, as individuals, develop and discover ourselves in the context of continuously shaping and re-shaping our interactions with communities. From this, the goals of morality are seen to be positive even though negative rules are needed to set limits on what is an intolerable behaviour in the community life, that is, the common life. In this sense, political and moral life is envisaged predominantly in terms of the positive pursuit of goods for humans (MacIntyre 1980, 31) .",

This is where the two competing standpoints come to a head, clashing precariously as thousands of lives are lost each day as countries attempt to flatten the infection curve and prevent the health systems from being overwhelmed, as well as to avoid putting healthcare workers in the impossible position of having to make impossible choices that have thus far resulted in none other than utilitarian and less than ethical decisions being made about choosing which patients should live or die, based on, for example, the age of a patient (Frakt 2020) . This is notwithstanding that medical professionals have never been endowed with the legal power to decide which patient should live and which should die-indeed, the question for medical professionals should always be what is the best treatment for any particular patient. It is true that scarce resources had placed the healthcare professionals in these very difficult dilemmas, but they do have an ethical and professional responsibility to allocate scarce resources in a fair and equitable manner. In any event, it could also be argued that healthcare professionals may have been able to avoid making such difficult decisions if citizenry had complied with infectious disease control measures and the hospital systems had not been flooded with very ill patients during a very short period of time.",

The deprivation of opportunities for such communal education about the good would appear to be, in MacIntyre's view, prevalent in liberalism (MacIntyre 1998) . This is the reason why MacIntyre rejects liberalism as an ideology because he argues that the rise of liberalism has resulted in the fabric of morality in society being torn apart-presumably he was writing about the US where he was based (MacIntyre 1980, 33) . Liberal individualism asserts the freedom of autonomous adults to pursue their own individual ends, and protects the individual from community-imposed determinations of the good with the end result that the government becomes the protector of the individual autonomy, at the sacrifice of the true common good (MacIntyre 2007) . This is exactly what we have witnessed in 2020 with governments in many countries, including the US, struggling to assert their authority over citizenry to isolate, and to lockdown for the common good of the entire community, which, of course, also includes the healthcare system.",

This kind of summation of individual goods could be reflected in notions of utilitarian common good, where not only the interests of the elderly patient may yield to that of a younger patient deemed to be more healthy, and more likely to survive and hence more deserving of the use of a ventilator (Frakt 2020 ) but also where a healthy patient may be sacrificed to save many other patients.",

It may be the case however that teenagers, having attained some maturity and practical reasoning abilities, are more suitable to ethics education. Certainly by the time one enters university, one would benefit from ethics education and some universities do mandate undergraduates take general education courses such as ethics. However, if ethics education is left until university, those who do not attend university would be left out.
