Concurrent circulation of both classic and variant IBVs have been identified in most parts of the world, raising major challenges to global prevention and control efforts. Therefore, immunopathogenesis, particularly early host responses, needs to be better understood for effective control of diseases caused by different strains of IBVs. We investigated differing immunopathogenesis in chickens following infection with IS/885/00-like (885), QX-like (QX) and M41 IBV strains. We confirmed that the histopathological changes, proinflammatory and innate immune gene responses were induced to different magnitudes, depending on the IBV strain. Results indicated that upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-1b) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF) expression is induced by IBV M41 in the trachea and by IBV 885 and QX in the kidney, which mainly coincides with tracheal and renal histopathological lesions respectively caused by these strains. In addition, elevated levels of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN-b expression occurred concurrently with greater lesion severity in IBV infected trachea and kidney tissues.

In this study, we investigated the differential immunopathogenesis in chickens infected with three IBV strains used previously for an in vitro study .
