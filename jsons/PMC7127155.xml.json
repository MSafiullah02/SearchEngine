Such measures can control [10] or drastically reduce transmission [11] when vigorously employed throughout the years [9]. Among the strategies for controlling zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, the culling of seropositive dogs in endemic areas has proved ineffective because it is expensive, the impact on human disease is limited and it is not socially accepted [12]. Several studies showed that treatment of canine leishmaniasis with pentavalent antimonials or pentamidine might result in clinical recovery with remission of the symptoms and even parasitological cure to the animals, although relapse normally occurs in the following 5\u201312 months [1].",

Moreover the LeIF component was shown to have therapeutic activity in the Balb/c model of cutaneous leishmaniasis [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. More importantly, these antigens were recently and successfully used in an immunochemotherapeutic protocol to treat human mucosal leishmaniasis [25]. The three antigens are present in both amastigotes and promastigotes forms of the parasite and are highly conserved among Leishmania sp., a requisite for ensuring cross-species protection [23], [26], [27]. A polyprotein constituted of these three antigens have been engineered to a final vaccine candidate, namely Leish-110f\u00ae, and when formulated with the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) plus squalene (MPL-SE\u00ae) elicited excellent protective immunity against L. major infection in the murine model [28]. In addition, a clinical investigation in dogs immunized with these recombinant antigens (TSA, LmSTI1 and LeIF) formulated with adjuvant MPL-SE\u00ae induced almost exclusively a Th1 response (IgG2/IgG1 \u2265 40), suggesting its use in field trials against CanL [29]. However, further studies demonstrated the failure of this multi-subunit vaccine to protect dogs against CanL in experimental and natural conditions [30], [31].",

All dogs included in this trial had typical clinical signs for symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis [2] as they presented lymphadenopathy, slight decrease of weight and opaque eye, alopecia, eczema, and skin ulcers and never received any treatment for CanL. Demonstration of parasites was performed before the beginning of the clinical trial using direct microscopic examination of Giemsa stain smears of bone marrow aspirates and ear skin biopsies. Bone marrow aspirates were also used to isolate the parasites in NNN-LIT culture medium. Serological tests were done using immunofluorescence test (IFAT) and ELISA using cut-off dilutions of 1:40 and 1:80, respectively. Crude Leishmania antigen and rk39 were used in the ELISA tests to follow the infection [32].",

Increase of lymphocyte counts was also seen in all groups at the end of the study but it was not significant when compared with baseline values. From day 60 of treatment, a statistically significant increase (P\n < 0.05) on values of red blood cells (RBCs) was demonstrated for animals that received either chemo or immunochemotherapy. Conversely, animals from remaining groups presented a progressive anaemia during the study.",

However, recent development of drug resistance associated with variation in the sensitivity of Leishmania species to this drug strongly reveals the need to develop (or re-develop) alternative treatment, which might replace or complement existing or newer therapeutic drugs [44], [45], [46]. Indeed, drug combinations for treating VL have been tested with some promising results to treat leishmaniasis caused by drug resistant [45]. Similarly, combination of drugs and vaccines or even vaccine alone has been successfully used to treat American cutaneous leishmaniasis over the past years [47], with low number of recurrence cases. Combined anti-Leishmania treatment using vaccine and drug would enhance drug efficacy and stimulate host immune responses, resulting in a therapeutic harness of cellular immune protection. The therapeutic use of recombinant antigens with standard drugs for treatment of leishmaniasis would be an advantage due their well-characterized nature required to meet both scientific and regulatory standards. Indeed, the leishmanial recombinant antigens TSA, LmSTI1 and LeIF in combination with the cytokine Granulocyte and Monocyte Colony Stimulator Factor (GM-CSF) used as adjuvant were recently and successfully used to treat human mucosal leishmaniasis [27].",

In dogs, chemotherapy using pentavalent antimonies has been mostly unsuccessful and in many occasions has reportedly caused exacerbation of disease [50], [51]. Although major clinical signs of disease disappear after treatment and treated animals may present a good general health status, this might not indicate the complete absence of parasites in spleen, bone marrow or skin [52].

On the other hand, the transmission blocking effect conferred by the immunochemotherapeutic protocol still remains uncertain since animals treated under the same protocol also presented a positive xenodiagnosis.

            "text": "Visceral leishmaniasis treatment is typically considered successful when clinical signs have disappeared, results of haematological and serum biochemical's analyses are within the reference ranges [54]. While the clinical recovery observed in those groups (Glucantime\u00ae\n + Leish-110f\u00ae/MPL-SE and Glucantime\u00ae alone) could be related to the use of the drug itself, the immunochemotherapy cohort had a reduced number of deaths, higher survival probability and higher specific cellular reactivity to leishmanial antigens, in comparison with the treatment with Glucantime\u00ae alone. Resistance to leishmaniasis is well known to be mediated by cell-mediated protective immune response to specific Leishmania antigens [55]. Although each clinical manifestation of Leishmania infection has a different immunological picture, patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis lack cell reactivity particularly when specific antibody titers are high. This T cell deficiency is manifested in vitro by failure of the T lymphocytes to proliferate after stimulation to parasite antigens [56]. Usually, these patients become responsive after resolution of their symptoms [57]. Therefore, T cell reactivity shown either in vitro (e.g. lymphocyte proliferative responses to Leishmania antigens) or in vivo (e.g. delayed hypersensitivity to leishmanial antigens) is an important surrogate of protection against leishmaniasis [52], [58]. Consequently, a treatment that provides clinical recovery and restore, at least partially, the cell reactivity against leishmanial components is highly desirable. Hence, CanL vaccines that promote at least partial protection and trigger a Th1 type of immune response, which eventually might lead to protection against disease, should be also considered in future protocols of immunochemotherapy of infected dogs. In this way, it was recently reported that a heterologous prime-boost vaccination with a non-replicative vaccinia recombinant vector expressing LACK confers protection against canine visceral leishmaniasis, which was correlated with absence of visceral leishmaniasis symptoms, lower parasite-specific antibodies, higher degree of T cell activation in parasitized organs and higher synthesis of Th1 cytokines [59]. In addition, the long lasting protective fucose mannose ligand (FML)-vaccine (Leishmune) [60] was demonstrated to be also effective in the immunotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis of asymptomatic [61] and symptomatic [14] infected dogs. The treatment of symptomatic dogs with Leishmune vaccine reduced the clinical symptoms and evidence of parasite, modulating the outcome of the infection and blocking transmission of the parasites to phlebotomines [14].",

On the other hand, we chose to use monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) as adjuvant because of its strong immunostimulatory effects of the innate immune system by the direct activating of antigen presenting cells to produce IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF and IFN-\u03b3, which results in enhanced phagocytosis and microbicidal activities [62]. In addition, a formulation of these antigens plus with (MPL-SE\u00ae) has been previously used in dogs and shown to be highly efficient in inducing a powerful Th1 response to the recombinant antigens [29], although it failure to induce protection after immunization in dogs [30], [31].",

Although the number of animals in each group was not large enough to warrant a statistical analysis this was an intriguing result. Unfortunately, this protocol alone was not sufficient to lead to total parasite elimination as it has occurred in two animals of the group treated with both Glucantime\u00ae and Leish-110f\u00ae. However, these results together suggest that the immunotherapy with Leish-110f\u00ae can be an important adjunct to anti-CanL therapeutic protocol that uses lower doses of Glucantime\u00ae. In other words, the immunotherapy can be an important factor that may favour the administration of much lower concentration of Glucantime\u00ae that is administered in the current protocols (also used in the current studies). It is well known that Glucantime\u00ae has serious side effects including death. In the present studies using Cox's statistical analysis based on serum levels of albumin, gamma globulin, and creatinine it was defined that the animals treated with Glucantime\u00ae had an instantaneous death risk of 3 times higher than animals under other treatments. Therefore, the institution of an immunochemotherapeutic protocol constituted of Leish-110f\u00ae together with Glucantime\u00ae may help to define new schemes with lower doses of the latter, consequently minimizing the risk of death. This is an interesting possibility that deserves further investigation.",

Several former studies have described immunochemotherapy protocols using a whole parasite vaccine as immunogenic component [47]. However, the use of multiple recombinant antigens delivered as a single recombinant polyprotein would result in a better approach to the immunochemotherapy as they represent higher standardized products, which simplify the manufacturing process and are attractive to distribution in developing countries due the associated reduced cost. This approach also represents a valid alternative treatment for those cases where conventional chemotherapy is not effective.",
