It is related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other human coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome first detected in China in 2002-2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively. 1 Based on currently available global data, COVID-19 is thought to cause mild, limited, or no symptoms in at least 80% of those infected. 2\u20134 A substantial portion of COVID-infected individuals are suspected to be asymptomatic carriers; estimates derived from select populations of quarantined individuals who underwent widespread testing (e.g. cruise ship passengers and Japanese citizens evacuated from China) range from 18-33%.5,6 Of those known to be COVID-19 positive, approximately 20-30% will develop more severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Such disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death. 7\u20139 Risk factors for severe disease have been reported to include advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes\u2014although recent data suggests hospitalization may be more common among younger COVID-19 patients than previously suspected. 7,8",

While N95 respirator masks physically filter 95% of particles at least 1\u03bcm in size from the inspired air, CDC and OSHA guidelines nonetheless suggest avoiding use of an oscillating bone saw at autopsy in cases of suspected/confirmed COVID-19. If a saw is employed, it is recommended that a vacuum shroud be attached to assist in capturing aerosols.17,18 Other oscillating saw aerosol reduction techniques to consider include moistening the saw blade before cutting, using autopsy tables with built-in ventilation, tenting plastic around the decedent\u2019s neck and head to entrap aerosols, and wearing a HEPA-filtered PAPR rather than N95 mask.46\u201349 As in the current presented case, other general splash and aerosol reduction techniques (e.g. eschewing use of vacuum assisted aspirator, sink tissue grinder, or hose) are also advised.

Surface disinfection with diluted household bleach solutions (i.e. of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solutions, or alcohol solutions (i.e. with at least 70% ethanol) have been shown to inactivate human coronaviruses within 1 minute.58,59 For hospital-grade disinfectants, staff should verify their suitability for use against SARS-CoV-2 and ensure disinfectants remain on surfaces in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency recommendations.60,61 While conclusive data regarding how long infectious human remains may harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, autopsies in cases of SARS found that SARS-CoV could be recovered from lung tissue and grown in cell culture up to seven days after death.62,63 Considering that there is reportedly 75-80% similarity between the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (causative agent of SARS), these results suggest that protective precautions are called for even in cases of delayed suspected COVID-19 death investigations or autopsies. 1,64 While limited data exists regarding formalin inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue, formalin fixation at room temperature has been shown to inactivate most of SARS-CoV (i.e. close to assay detection limits) within a day.64,65",

Additionally, sampling both lungs with a single swab may increase recovery of viral RNA. Concurrent testing for other causes of respiratory illness such as influenza is also strongly encouraged.17,19 In order to preserve limited viral testing kit supply, ME/C offices are encouraged to communicate with their testing laboratories to verify whether COVID-19 as well as other respiratory viral pathogen testing can be performed on a single swab.

Performing a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for SARS-CoV-2 requires neither a negative pressure room nor N95 respirator; basic contact and droplet precaution PPE are sufficient.17 In cases in which autopsy is merited, the above described precautions should be followed to prevent morgue staff-acquired COVID-19 infection. Some offices have elected to perform limited autopsies (e.g. precluding brain/spinal cord removal) in cases of suspected/known COVID-19 positivity to reduce morgue staff aerosol exposure. Others have incorporated antemortem or postmortem CT radiology as a means of helping triage decedents meriting testing and/or autopsy.19,21 Establishing collaborative relations with larger ME/C offices capable of safely autopsying suspected highly infectious disease cases should be encouraged. Globally, mobile biosafety autopsy facilities/laboratories with sophisticated infrastructure have been deployed during disease epidemics such as SARS and Ebola virus; advantages include the ability to mobilize rapidly to areas of need with minimal footprint.73\u201375 Such mobile facilities may be advisable in the US as well.",

Following appropriate decontamination of the body bag, a method of clearly designating the infectious nature of contents to funeral home personnel should be employed (e.g. body bag notification sticker); ME/C offices may want to consider modifying body release procedures to preclude contamination risks of opening body bag in morgue for funeral personnel identification.76 There is currently no CDC nor WHO requirement for cremation of COVID-19 positive decedents.17,20 While decedents can be buried or cremated as per current state requirements, burial may result in storage difficulties as social distancing-related funeral service delays. Further details of recommended funeral home/mortuary protocol in cases of COVID-19 positive decedents can be accessed on both the CDC as well as National Funeral Directors Association websites.77,78 ME/C offices are encouraged to closely collaborate with funeral homes/mortuaries to ensure body transportation and storage needs are met.

In order to ensure safety of scene investigators, medical examiners/coroners (ME/C), and morgue staff, developing an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, presentation, and prevention strategies is key. The current case presentation with literature review are intended to better inform and provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy. As community spread of COVID-19 increases, ME/C offices are encouraged to employ these biosafety principles broadly, as COVID carriers may be presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and yet still present infectious risk at autopsy. ME/C offices are cautioned that suspicious scene investigative history (e.g. nursing home resident or individual from homeless encampment) cannot necessarily be relied upon to identify COVID carriers. It is hoped that by documenting and sharing postmortem findings ME/C offices can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially assist in formulating therapeutic strategies to reduce disease mortality.",
