They cause mainly mosquito-borne diseases in vertebrates such as birds and rodents, which act as reservoir hosts. The genus Alphavirus is divided in two subcategories depending on the viruses' primary areas of endemicity and clinical manifestations [1], [2]. Old World Alphaviruses were initially identified in Asia and Africa, where they have been considered as causal agent of arthropathies [3], [4]. By contrast, New World Alphaviruses are usually implicated in neurological diseases with complications such as dysarthria, motor disorders and abnormal reflexes, and were detected solely in the Americas [5]. Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an exception to this classification. Despite its endemic distribution in South America, the induced disease has a clinical picture similar to the Old World Alphaviruses\n[6]. In particular, symptoms include mild-to-severe Dengue-like febrile syndrome, characterized by fever, headache, rash, myalgia, arthralgia and arthritis, which can be debilitating and can persist for months [4], [7], [8]. These clinical manifestations are reported also in the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease.",

It is worth mentioning that MAYV is mainly transmitted by mosquitos of Haemagogus and Aedes genera, the latter being also responsible for the distribution of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The recent Alphavirus outbreaks in concert with the absence of vaccines and targeted antiviral therapy emphasize the necessity to understand their replication mechanisms in detail [3], [12]. The global distribution and the constantly reported outbreaks of these viral infections point out the significance of preventing the potentially chronic, disabling and long-lasting complications caused by these viruses, in order to reduce the social and economic impacts of these zoonoses.",

NsP1 is carrying the enzymatic activities for the mRNA cap formation, nsP2 has a N-terminal domain with multiple enzymatic activities (e.g., ATPase, RNA helicase, RNA triphosphatase) [16], [17], [18]. Its C-terminal part is carrying a protease activity for polyprotein processing with a papain-like domain and is followed by a classical 2\u2019O-methyltransferase fold [19], [20]. NsP4 is carrying the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity [21] in charge of the replication/transcription. Many functions have been attributed to nsP3 in recent years [22]. Its C-terminal region, named HVR (hypervariable region), is a hub for interactions with several partners while its N-terminal region contains a globular macro domain (MD).",

The Alphaviruses MDs are located at the N-terminal region of nsP3 and adopt a \u03b2/\u03b1/\u03b2 mixed sandwich topology. Initially, MD's biological functions were linked to their ability to bind adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP-r), its derivative (Poly-) ADP-r and RNA. In addition, Alphaviruses MDs were found to be adenosine di-phosphoribose 1\u2033-phosphate phosphatases, but the role of this activity in viral replication remained elusive [27]. Subsequently, several studies proved its significance to viral replication and virulence, while recent studies proposed that the function of MDs is associated with their activity as ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting their implication in counteracting responses to infection [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. In general, viral MDs are postulated to be critically involved in replication complex formation, cell-specific viral replication and ADP-ribosylation dependent interactions with host proteins [37]. It remains to be investigated if and how distinct properties of different Alphaviruses MDs such as sequence, structure, dynamics and ligand binding can be correlated to different functions and different viral replication profiles.",

The addition and the removal of an ADP-r moiety to or from cellular targets are strongly regulated processes leading to functional changes through mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) and/or poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation). The induced alterations of enzymatic activities and the ability of ADP-ribosylated proteins to serve as \u201canchors\u201d for biomolecular interactions are connected with their assigned biological roles. These include DNA damage response, transcription signaling, cellular stress response, protein degradation and immune response. Most of the aforementioned functions require the cross-talk of proteins participating in the ADP-ribosylation and in other post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Recently, it was reported that ADP-ribosylation is induced upon Alphavirus infection in an interferon-independent manner [37].",

Note that signals of the neighboring residues Gly30\u2013Asp31, Cys34\u2013Ala36, Ala38, Gly112\u2013Phe114 and Asp119\u2013Arg120 are broadened beyond detection in the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the apo form of MAYV MD. Thus, their 1H,15N correlation peaks could not be assigned, strongly suggesting that the loops upstream to helices \u03b11 and \u03b13 undergo conformational exchange processes that may be relevant for the selectivity of substrate binding [52]. These data support the plasticity of two functionally important loops (Fig. 1c). According to our NMR data, the MAYV MD loop \u03b22\u2013\u03b11 seems to be more dynamic (lower S\n2 values and negative values {1HN}\u201315N NOEs, while at the same region, CHIKV exhibits only positive values; data not shown) than the corresponding segment of CHIKV MD (Fig. S2). In addition, the fact that the HN resonances of the neighboring residues mentioned above (Cys34\u2013Ala36 and Ala38) remain unidentified while the HNs of the corresponding segment in CHIKV apo MD could be assigned [53] (Fig. S2c), shows that an exchange process on an intermediate NMR timescale is present in the \u03b22\u2013\u03b11 loop of MAYV MD, but not in CHIKV MD.",

Furthermore, the analysis of the backbone amide chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) identifies the residues that are involved in this process (Fig. 2c and d). To this end, a complete backbone and side-chain resonance assignment of the MAYV MD\u2013ADP-r complex was obtained (BMRB accession no. 27612). Specifically, residues Asp10, Ala23, Asn24, Gln28, Gly32, Val33, Lys56, Val69, Ser110 and Ala116 exhibited the largest CSPs while undergoing chemical exchange between the free and the bound form in the slow exchange regime (~ 0.1\u20131 s, k\nex < <| \u0394\u03bd\n | and usually K\nd \u2248 \u03bc\u039c or lower [52]). In addition, adjacent amino acids like Ala9, Ala12, Thr13, Gly27, Val29, Asn72, Phe73, Leu109, Ser115 and G117 were also affected exhibiting a slow-exchange process during the interaction. The backbone HN resonances of Ile11, His25, Val37, Phe45, Ala68 and Lys146 broadened beyond detection, while those of Ala22, Gly30, Asp31, Cys34, Arg35, Ala36, Ala38, Gly112, Cys143 and Arg144, which were unassigned in the spectra of the apo MAYV MD, could be assigned in the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the MAYV MD\u2013ADP-r complex. These data suggest that the majority of the residues, which participate in ligand recognition and binding, are located near the positively charged ligand-binding cleft (Figs. 1d and 2d). It is worth mentioning that upon binding of ADP-r, the backbone and side-chain resonances of residues in the loops that comprise the positively charged cavity are observable, while they were not detectable in the free state of the protein. All these findings prove the high-affinity interaction of MAYV MD with ADP-r and indicate ligand binding via loops \u03b21\u2013\u03b22, \u03b22\u2013\u03b11, \u03b24\u2013\u03b12, and \u03b25\u2013\u03b13, which should comprise or be located nearby the anticipated binding cleft (Fig. 2d) [52].

The complex formation is achieved at a molar ratio of 1:4 (protein:ligand) and led to smaller CSP values than the intermediate or slow chemical exchange during the titrations with ADP and ADP-r, respectively. However, the residues exhibiting CSPs are practically the same as in the case of ADP. Similarly, the 1H,15N HSQC cross peaks of Ile11, Ala23, Asn24, Gly32, Val33, Val69, Leu108, Ser110 and Ala116 remained broadened beyond detection even after the last addition of ATP (Fig. 2f). On the other hand, Asp10, a key residue for the ligand binding, is in the fast-exchange regime upon addition of ATP to MAYV MD. The same behavior was observed for the other key residues Thr13 (Fig. 2f) and Leu109. Therefore, the interaction can be characterized best as fast exchange on the NMR timescale (k\nex > > | \u0394\u03bd\n |). Such an analysis of the binding kinetics can also provide an estimate of the binding affinity [52], [55], which in this case implies a weak binding with a K\nd of the order of ~ 10\u22123 M.

According to the literature [50], there are two structural water molecules that are H-bonded to the \u03b2-phosphate. In the crystal structures of the MDs from Oceanobacillus iheyensis (PDB ID: 5L9K) and CHIKV (PDB ID: 3GPO) in complexes with ADP-r, these water molecules interact with the conserved residues Ala29, Gly91 and Ala23, Gly70, respectively. Ala23 and Gly70 in MAYV MD exhibit much smaller CSPs (Fig. 2g and e) and undergo a fast-exchange process upon the addition of AMP compared to ADP, indicating an active role in the binding of the second phosphate group.",

            "text": "To further characterize the MAYV MD\u2013ADP-r interaction, MD mutants were designed considering the most affected regions in the CSP analysis (Fig. 2c) as well as available crystal structures of MD\u2013ADP-r complexes [25], [27], [28], [50], [56], [57] from various organisms. These structures reveal conserved patterns of amino acids that mediate the interaction of ADP-r with the protein (Fig. 2b). According to these models, the NH2 group of adenine forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of an aspartate (Fig. 2b, indicated with \u201c\u204e\u201d) at the beginning of the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 loop. The hydrophobic residue (Ile/Val) following this aspartate is also hydrogen-bonded to adenine via its backbone amide group. In several homologous structures (e.g., PDB ID: 2BFQ), an aromatic residue (Tyr/Phe) (indicated with \u201c$\u201d in Fig. 2b) is found to stabilize further the adenine through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking to its purine ring. The phosphate groups are connected through their oxygen atoms to the backbone amides of residues in two conserved sequence motifs around almost invariable Gly residues. The first motif is a Gly followed by Val/Leu just before helix \u03b11 (Fig. 2b, indicated with \u201c+\u201d), and the second one is Ser/Gly\u2013X/Thr\u2013Gly\u2013Ile/Val/Asn\u2013Tyr/Phe/Leu/Ala in the \u03b25\u2013\u03b13 loop (Fig. 2b, indicated with \u201c#\u201d). Finally, the distal ribose is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to an Asn residue in the \u03b22\u2013\u03b11 loop (Fig. 2b, indicated with \u201c\u02c4\u201d) [56], [57], [58], [59]. These residues, namely, Asp10/Ile11, Gly32/Val33, Gly112 and Asn24, are also present in MAYV MD (Fig. 2b) and interact with ADP-r as clearly shown by our CSP data (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3a).",

While the addition of CDP and UDP barely causes shifts to the 1H,15N resonances of MAYV MD suggesting that there is no interaction, GDP is apparently bound weakly. The interaction with GDP occurs in the fast-exchange regime, and there are only five residues with significant chemical shift changes: Ile11, Gly32, Leu109, Tyr142, and Lys146 (Fig. S5b). Compared to ADP binding (Fig. S5a), the CSPs are much smaller, no resonances are broadened beyond detection, there are no meaningful CSPs for residues Ala23\u2013Asn24 and Val69\u2013Asn72, and the key residue Asp10 is only minimally involved in the interaction. According to the available x-ray models [25], [50] in the presence of ADP, the carboxyl group of Asp10 of MAYV MD is most likely hydrogen-bonded to the NH2 group of adenine. However, if the orientation of the two nucleotides in the MAYV MD binding cleft were the same, this carboxyl group would repel the carbonyl oxygen on the C6 atom of guanine, which may explain the weaker interaction of GDP observed here. On the other hand, Ile11 usually forms a hydrogen bond to the base moiety of ADP and is still found to interact with GDP.",

The observed interactions of MAYV MD with C12 and U12 RNA oligonucleotides are driven putatively by electrostatic attraction. This hypothesis is based on the absence of interaction between CDP or UDP and MAYV MD (Fig. S5c and d). The oligonucleotides C12 and U12 seem to bind to the positively charged cleft of the protein (Fig. 4b and c) due to their increased negative charge compared to the diphosphate nucleotides.",

This selectivity characterizes a number of MDs, and data reported herein show that MAYV MD shares structural and functional features with other Alphavirus MDs. The MAYV MD polypeptide folds into a well-ordered structure in solution, characterized by the \u03b2/\u03b1/\u03b2 \u201csandwich\u201d topology and peptide segments with functionally relevant intrinsic flexibility. These segments surround a well-defined binding pocket, which provides high selectivity and variable affinity toward adenosine derivatives and adenine-rich RNA oligonucleotides, with a preference for ADP-r. The critical role [27] of Asp10 for ligand binding is confirmed by a dramatic reduction of binding affinity upon its mutation to Ala. Moreover, this study demonstrates that non-conserved residues in loop regions, like \u03b22\u2013\u03b11, \u03b11\u2013\u03b23 and \u03b25\u2013\u03b13, induce different local conformations and backbone dynamics in MAYV MD compared to other homologous MDs, thus customizing its ligand binding properties. This finding may represent a general principle in the structure\u2013function relationship of viral MDs and precludes the prediction of ligand interactions and function on the sole basis of sequence homology [30], [51]. Note that ADP-r binding has recently been correlated in different cell lines with immediate or slow viral replication [42].",

In the former case, the two MDs have ~ 77% sequence identity, but SFV does not bind ADP-r [30]. In the latter case, a group 3 CoV MD exhibits great structural similarity to a group 1 CoV MD, but does not bind ADP-r, whereas the group 1 CoV MD binds ADP-r with a K\nd in the \u03bc\u039c range [61], [62]. A similar finding has also been reported for MDs of the Alphavirus family. Some of us have observed different binding properties for the two MDs from VEEV and CHIKV, when they attempted to form the a MD\u2013ADP-r complex [27]. VEEV MD, which has 59% sequence identity with CHIKV MD, did not bind ADP-r due to an unfavorable reorientation of the N24 and F114 side chains, when VEEV crystals were soaked with ADP-r. This finding suggests that even minor conformational differences in the loops \u03b22\u2013\u03b11 and \u03b25\u2013\u03b13 (Fig. 1c) can fine-tune the substrate binding capacity of closely related MDs. The differences in structure and mobility of the MAYV MD loops \u03b22\u2013\u03b11, \u03b11\u2013\u03b23 and \u03b25\u2013\u03b13 with respect to CHIKV (Figs. 1c, S1 and S2) provide new insights into the structural basis of the functional role of these MD polypeptide segments. In addition, the structure elucidation of the MAYV MD along with the NMR driven interaction studies between the MD and ssRNA defines the positively charged surface illustrated in Fig. 1d, which represents another binding site, distinct from the ADP-r binding crevice, and its role in binding negatively charged biopolymer(s) (Fig. 4). These results are in line with the different roles of MD during the early and late stages of viral replication, in which a multi-functional domain is likely required [37]. The observations presented here enlighten the structural and physicochemical determinants of MD-ligand interactions and provide valuable functional insights into the MD of this neglected virus reinforcing the efforts to design novel structure-based inhibitors of this Alphavirus protein domain.",

Eighty-four torsion angle constraints used in the structural calculations were derived from TALOS+ [65].
