The spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV ranges from odynophagia and dysphagia, to nausea and vomiting, to abdominal pain and finally diarrhea and tenesmus. As with normal hosts, gastrointestinal disorders are very common in HIV patients, whether it be from opportunistic infections secondary to the patient's immunosuppressed status, medication induced, or through other etiologies. Almost all HIV and AIDS patients have some gastrointestinal complaints throughout the course of their illness. With the dramatic changes in HIV care because of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the mid-1990s, the incidence of opportunistic infections are decreasing, and as a result, the clinical picture of gastrointestinal illnesses in HIV is changing. The evaluation of the HIV patient with gastrointestinal complaints requires a thorough history and physical exam, in addition to selected studies, in order to diagnose the correct disease and treat accordingly.",

At least one-third of patients with HIV before the ART era had esophageal complaints,1 and the incidence increased with the progression of the disease. Most of the symptoms in these patients are secondary to opportunistic infections caused by the patient's immunosuppressed state, and related to the degree of immunosuppression. The most common etiologies of esophageal pathology and esophagitis in AIDS patients (Table 23.1\n) are Candida species, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).2 In addition, there is also an entity of idiopathic esophageal ulcers (IEU) that is also seen in HIV patients, which may be immunologically mediated,3 or caused by HIV itself.4 Other etiologies of esophageal complaints include malignancy (especially lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma) and other non-infectious causes. However, with the introduction of protease inhibitors (PIs) in 1996 and ART, and the decreased incidence of AIDS, more esophageal complaints in HIV these days are related to common etiologies like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) than opportunistic infections.5\n",

The history and physical exam is obviously important, as it may lead to a discovery of GERD, or pill-induced esophagitis. In addition, patients with disseminated CMV (e.g. CMV retinitis) with esophageal symptoms (especially odynophagia) may respond to CMV antiviral therapy in the absence of diagnostic endoscopy and biopsy. The most common sign on physical exam that relates to esophageal complaints is oral thrush, which can be suggestive of esophageal candidiasis in patients with esophageal complaints. In these patients, especially those with only dysphagia (or dysphagia and odynophagia, but not those with solely odynophagia) it may be beneficial to document the response from an empiric trial of oral fluconazole, as opposed to endoscopy.6 If there is a symptomatic response to the fluconazole, then it can be presumed the patient had candidal esophagitis and proceed accordingly.",

Barium esophagography is relatively insensitive and non-specific and should not be used for diagnostic purposes, but the most characteristic finding in candidal esophagitis is diffuse mucosal irregularity resulting in a \u2018shaggy\u2019 appearance mimicking diffuse ulceration.7 CMV and IEU may appear as well circumscribed ulcers that may be shallow or deep, and are indistinguishable on barium swallow.8 Of course, radiography can determine a neoplastic origin to dysphagia in patients with malignancies. Another form of evaluation is brush cytology, where a cytology brush is passed through a nasogastric tube and obtains tissue for viral cultures and immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, this leads to large sampling error, because it is done blindly without visualization of the lumen, and misses diagnoses (as patients may have two infectious processes, and IEU cannot be diagnosed). Viral culture and cytologic brushings add little in the evaluation of AIDS patients with esophagitis over endoscopy with biopsy.9 Endoscopy with biopsy generally yields a viral or fungal diagnosis based on culture and hematoxylin and eosin staining (which will exclude a viral etiology); only after several biopsy samples do not show any etiology of the ulcerations can a tentative, exclusionary diagnosis of IEU be made.",

It should be suspected in patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of <100 cells/mm3 (though can occur at any CD4+ count), and esophageal symptoms with or without thrush, which can be absent in 30% of patients.11 In patients with HIV and new onset symptoms, an empiric trial of standard dosed fluconazole is an effective strategy, as 82% of patients in a prospective study responded. If there is no response, endoscopy can be pursued.6 In patients that fail empiric antifungal therapy, the most common etiology (in 77% of the patients) is ulcerative esophagitis as opposed to persistent candidiasis.12 Fluconazole is the drug of choice for candidiasis, with a loading dose of 200 mg orally followed by 100 mg daily from 10\u201314 days. Clotrimazole troches are also successful, as topical treatment of esophageal candidiasis,13 but nystatin is not.14 Itraconazole and ketoconazole are efficacious systemic therapies, but not as effective as fluconazole.15,\n16 Amphotericin B is also a helpful therapy, but is generally used only in azole-resistant patients because of the toxicity of the medication. Low-dose amphotericin (0.3\u20130.5 mg/kg per day for 7\u201314 days) is usually adequate. Caspofungin can also be used in candidal esophagitis, and is felt to be as efficacious as fluconazole and well tolerated.17 However, it is only available in intravenous form and is more expensive, but may be the drug of choice for azole-resistant mucosal candidiasis because of the relative lack of toxicity compared with amphotericin B. Primary prophylaxis of candidal disease is not recommended because of the non-life-threatening nature of the disease, the effectiveness of acute therapy, and the risk of antifungal resistance.",

It may be discovered only after treatment for Candida, as they may exist concurrently in 20% of patients.21 The incidence of CMV esophagitis has declined dramatically in the ART era. Treatment for CMV esophagitis involves a wide array of antiviral medications, namely ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Ganciclovir was the first agent used to combat CMV and has the most data behind it; the response rate is about 70\u201380%. It is given intravenously in a 2\u20134 week induction period, 5\u201310 mg/kg per day, but has dose limiting side-effects, mainly bone marrow suppression (and resultant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Oral ganciclovir can also be used as maintenance therapy, but the data is limited. Intravenous foscarnet (90 mg/kg b.i.d., 2\u20133 weeks) is seen as equally effective to intravenous ganciclovir in the treatment of CMV esophagitis, but comes with a nephrotoxic side-effect profile; however, randomized studies have shown equal efficacy and safety.22 Foscarnet is generally used in cases of clinical failure after ganciclovir induction.23 Oral valganciclovir (900 mg/day) has not been tested in CMV esophagitis, but does have 60% of the bioavailability of intravenous ganciclovir. Cidofovir also can treat CMV, but is not typically used because of nephrotoxicity.",

As with esophageal disease, the incidence of opportunistic infections has decreased in the ART era, though the incidence of chronic diarrhea has remained steady even in the ART era.29 The evaluation of diarrhea includes a thorough history and physical, as much can be determined from just eliciting the patient's history of symptoms. If the diarrhea occurs with upper abdominal cramps, or bloating, this suggests an upper intestinal source, or enteritis. Bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and lower abdominal cramping imply colonic involvement. In addition, patients with a history of receptive anal intercourse have a higher involvement of colitis and sexually transmitted pathogens (e.g. gonorrhea, HSV, etc.) in the anorectal area. Homosexual or bisexual men have a 3-fold higher incidence of diarrhea than patients in other risk groups. Obviously, travel and diet history can also be important in the histories of HIV patients with diarrhea. As with other aspects of HIV, opportunistic infections tend to be more common in the setting of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts (and therefore greater immunosuppression).",

The tests to order include bacterial culture, clostridium difficile toxin assay, as well as looking for ova and parasites, especially Isospora, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidia. These generally need to be specified as potential pathogens when the sample is sent to microbiology when looking at ova and parasites. In addition, a gram stain or methylene blue stain for fecal leukocytes can also be helpful, as evidence of fecal leukocytes may point towards a picture of colitis. Another form of non-invasive testing is blood cultures and serologies, which can be helpful for the diagnosis of systemic opportunistic infections like Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) or viral etiologies like CMV. Especially in the patients who have diarrhea and fever, MAI may be a possibility. However, with all of these etiologies, a diagnosis may be treated, and symptoms may still persist as secondary infections may also be present.

Abnormal tissue should be biopsied, but if the mucosa is normal then random tissue can be sent. The flexible sigmoidoscopy is better than the alternatives as it does not require sedation. If small intestinal etiology is suspected, an EGD (going past the second portion of the duodenum) can help determine the cause of the diarrhea through biopsies of the small bowel, sent not only for pathology, but also electron microscopy and culture analysis. If the flexible sigmoidoscopy is nondiagnostic, and there is still no diagnosis from other studies, a colonoscopy can be performed so more biopsies can be done to rule out opportunistic infections, especially in the ileum.

In addition, anal neoplasms as a result of human papillomavirus (HPV) and other etiologies can also occur. Anorectal carcinoma has an increased incidence in both HIV patients and among homosexual males, and is the fourth most common malignancy seen in HIV;45 HIV+ homosexual men have twice the incidence than HIV negative homosexual men. Anal squamous cell carcinoma is frequently associated with squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and HPV, much like cervical carcinoma, and can be detected by anorectal cytology, similar to Papanicolaou smears.46 The gold standard for diagnosis of anorectal neoplastic disease is still anoscopy with biopsy, though anorectal cytology can be useful as a screening test.Box 23.1Differential diagnosis in anorectal disease in HIV patientsBacterial\u2022\nNeisseria gonorrhea\n\u2022\nChlamydia trachomatis (including Lymphogranuloma venereum)\u2022\nTreponema pallidum (syphilis)\u2022\nShigella\n\u2022\nSalmonella\n\u2022\nE. coli\n\nViral\u2022Herpes Simplex (HSV)\u2022Human Papillomavirus (HPV)\u2022Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\nOther\u2022Anorectal carcinoma\u2022Crohn's disease\u2022Ulcerative colitis\u2022Radiation proctitis\u2022Anal fissures\u2022Anal fistulas\u2022Perirectal abscess.\n",

Anal condyloma is the most common HIV related anal pathology, and is associated with HPV infection; treatment options include a variety of surgical options, including cryotherapy. The four most common infectious causes of proctitis in men who have sex with men are gonorrhea, herpes simplex, chlamydia and syphilis.47 Gonorrhea and chlamydia are typically treated together with ceftriaxone 125 mg i.m. once and azithromycin 1 g orally once; fluoroquinolones, oral cephalosporins and doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) can also be used. Primary syphilis is treated with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units i.m. once (or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks if penicillin allergic). HSV infections, as described earlier with esophagitis and colitis, can also cause perianal and rectal ulcerations, with associated symptoms of tenesmus, pain, and bleeding. Treatment is with antiherpetic medications like acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, as explained earlier, with foscarnet in acyclovir-resistant cases. Other etiologies of proctitis include lymphogranuloma venereum, as well as other causes of colitis detailed above; clinical overlap can also happen in HIV patients. In addition to a thorough physical examination, all patients with anorectal symptoms should have anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy with mucosal biopsy to look for fissures, perirectal abscesses, and fistulas in addition to searching for opportunistic infections, with microbiological studies sent for viral, fungal and bacterial cultures.",
