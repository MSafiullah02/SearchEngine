Both agreed to reimburse HBCR with the understanding that the quality of care and documentation would be identical to FBCR. In addition, they agreed that a daily, immediately available supervising physician would not be required because it was (a) inconsistent with contemporary practice of FBCR in which patients are encouraged to exercise on their own at home on days they are not scheduled to attend FBCR and (b) a service delivered via telehealth.

Patient education on pathophysiology, risk factor modification, medication compliance, etc, is facilitated using a series of 28 narrated slide shows (https://www.henryford.com/services/cardiology/support/cardiac-rehab/home-based-cardiac-rehabilitation), each of which is 5-8 min in duration. The slide show(s) to be reviewed by a patient before their next HBCR session is decided upon by the patient and the CR clinician.

However, scheduling the HBCR sessions for 20 min each allows each clinician to see 3 patients/hr, bringing productivity closer to that of a typical FBCR program. We currently conduct approximately 45 TM-HBCR visits/mo. Developing technology to allow the clinician to conduct multiple HBCR sessions simultaneously is necessary to improve productivity. Another limitation of the model is the inability to quickly respond to adverse events that may occur during exercise. For this reason, each HBCR session begins with confirming patient location and address. Furthermore, the highest risk patients (eg, left ventricular assistive device) are not currently eligible for HBCR. Finally, it is important to state that although specific brand names were used in the text of this article, these only represent the equipment that was available and compatible with existing work processes already in place and should not be construed as an endorsement.",
