The prevalence in India was roughly 10% of the global burden, that is, 5.8 lakhs.[14] From India, crude prevalence rates (CPR) between 6 and 53/100,000 have been reported. Above the age of 60 years, the PRs were higher, being 247/100,000.[15] It is known to occur in 1% of people above the age of 65 years. As per WHO estimates, the highest mortality in COVID-19 is among older individuals, with the highest death rates in those above the age of 80 years. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that persons with PD affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in India form a particularly high-risk population since most PD patients are above the age of 60 years. There is also the possibility that stress, especially high during these times, unmasks latent PD.[16] Whether there is an increase in the incidence or prevalence of PD following the pandemic will only be answered by long-term longitudinal studies.",

Conversely, whether the virus will influence drug effects is also not known. Foremost among PD drugs is the potential role of amantadine. Amantadine was used in the management of the influenza A virus. It acts by interfering with virus uncoating inside the cell. It blocks the M2-protein which forms an ion channel on the viral membrane which is required for virus transport inside the cell. However, its use was associated with the emergence of drug-resistant mutants and hence, it is no longer favored for this indication.
