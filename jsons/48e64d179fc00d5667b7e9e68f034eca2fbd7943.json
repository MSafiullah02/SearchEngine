            "text": "the United States. 2 Community transmission (cases without connection to travel) is now well documented in the United States. However, these cases likely represent the tip of the iceberg given the limitations on testing in the United States thus far. More than 700 publications have appeared in the medical literature and document the most common symptoms of fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Laboratory findings include lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase; radiography findings include bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity of the lungs on chest computed tomography scan. 3 Diagnostic testing using real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction has moved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to include state public health laboratories and, most recently, commercial laboratory options, 4 and work to develop a serology test for COVID-19 has begun. 5 Fortunately, pregnant women have not been forgotten. Three case series, for a total of 31 pregnancies affected by COVID-19, have been published, 6-8 and a WHO report from China provides limited information on 147 pregnancies. 9 Reviews examining features during pregnancy of diseases caused by other coronaviruses (eg, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), in the context of limited information on COVID-19 during pregnancy, have been published. 1,10 Guidelines for pregnant women have quickly been made available through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 11 and responses to frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and pregnancy have been posted by the CDC. 12 However, many key questions remain about COVID-19 in general and specific to pregnant women. One critical question about COVID-19 relates to the case-fatality rate of the disease. Early data from Wuhan, China, suggested that 4.3% of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 died 3 ; however, it was recognized that early estimates can overestimate the case-fatality rate because mild or asymptomatic cases are often missed early in an outbreak. Later data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention based on more than 70,000 cases suggested a lower case-fatality rate of 2.3% 13 ; recent data reported in the media from Iran have suggested a higher case-fatality rate of just less than 9%. 14 South Korea has reported 75 deaths among 8,236 confirmed cases for a lower case-fatality rate of 0.9%. 15 The casefatality rate depends not only on the disease and complete ascertainment of cases, but on the health care provided to affected patients and the age and health of the population studied. Given the small number of cases in the United States and the limited testing per-formed thus far, the case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States is unknown.",

One vital question is whether persons who are asymptomatic can transmit the virus; case reports have suggested asymptomatic transmission is possible, but how often this occurs is unknown. 16, 17 Because of the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when a person touches a contaminated surface, another critical issue is how long the virus can survive on surfaces. A recent review article suggests that coronaviruses could survive as long as 9 days depending on the surface and the type of coronavirus. 18 Answers to these questions are essential to guidance on infection control and disinfection and other public health control measures and will require careful study, including examination of seroprevalence among patients who never show symptoms and additional studies of virus persistence and inactivation.",

Preliminary information suggests that pregnant women are not more severely affected than the general population 1 ; however, the numbers of pregnant women reported have been small, and comparison is needed with nonpregnant women of similar age rather than with all persons with COVID-19, a population that is older (median age is approximately 50 years) and has underlying conditions. A small study that compared pregnant women with a matched control group of nonpregnant women of similar age suggests that pregnant women with SARS may have an increased risk of severe disease and death. 19 Whether intrauterine or perinatal transmission occurs is also unknown. Among the small number of pregnancies reported thus far, no evidence of transmission to the neonate has been observed; however, these women were nearly all infected in the third trimester and most underwent cesarean delivery. [6] [7] [8] The effects of the virus earlier in pregnancy are completely unknown; no neonates have been delivered to women infected in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.",

During the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, some health care systems in Canada had well pregnant women use separate facilities for labor and delivery. 27 Finally, owing to possible disruptions to health care delivery, pregnant women might benefit from having copies of their health care records. 26 As the situation with COVID-19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date on transmission in their area and on national guidance. Obstetricians should know who to contact at their hospital as well as their local or state health department if questions about testing or management arise. Obstetricians should regularly check the CDC website (www.cdc.gov) for clinical updates and sign up to receive Health Alert Network messages (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/updates.asp), the CDC's primary method for sharing urgent public health information by email. The CDC website has a wide range of information for health professionals on a number of topics, including clinical care (eg, availability of investigational therapeutics such as remdesivir), infection control, guidance for evaluating persons suspected of having COVID-19, and inpatient obstetric health care guidance, among others. This information is regularly updated as new information becomes available. Staying up to date on local disease activity by following state or local health department websites is also necessary. Obstetricians should also regularly check updated information on ACOG's website (www.acog. org), including Practice Advisories, which are brief, focused statements that are rapidly issued in response to urgent clinical issues. The websites for both ACOG and Obstetrics & Gynecology (greenjournal.org) provide direct links to the CDC for easy access to these critical resources.",

On December 31, 2019, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the outbreak, and shortly thereafter, on January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen. Just 2 days later, Chinese investigators shared the genetic sequence of the virus, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of its sequence similarity to the virus that caused a worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of illness with this novel coronavirus (now known as coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 1 On March 11, the WHO declared a pandemic, indicating global spread of this novel coronavirus.",
