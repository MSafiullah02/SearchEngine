Railways are not only used for freight purposes but are the primary means of long distance travel for a majority of lower, lower-middle and middle class population. Due to rapid electrification of railway lines and improved track technologies, rail travel is not only getting faster but is a very cost-effective means for passenger transport. While in high-income countries, railway transportation is considered one of the safest modes of public transport, owing to better infrastructure and stringent laws, the situation is not the same in LMIC's.",

As these data are generated from the police records, it is often underreported, even some studies suggest an underreporting of around 24% in such railway incidents [2].",

Most of the time, the intent of injury is reported by survived patients or based on narratives and interpretations of bystanders, fellow passengers and train drivers, thus subject to bias. There is also no linkage of judiciary data with medical records. In developed countries, most of the injuries recorded are deliberate, constituting more than two-third fatalities among all train-associated injuries. Virdee et al. reported that mortality rates between the accidental and intentional injury groups were almost the same, highlighting that those who attempt railway suicide are not more likely to die [13]. Limosin et al. showed that regardless of location or intent, train-associated injuries are caused by similar mechanisms and can be regarded as 'person hit by train' events leading to the same severe consequences [14]. This analysis comes with a perspective that any preventive measure directed for one mechanism will work for others as well, at least partially. Platform screen door (PSD) installation at platforms is one such intervention. Two studies have shown positive results in Hong Kong, where it reduced suicides by 59\u201384% and all injuries at platforms by 68.8% with no displacement of suicide attempters to unsealed platforms [15, 16].",

Virdee et al. reported a similar mortality rate, with the majority of victims (73%) succumbing to their injuries, either in the ED or the operating room shortly after admission [13]. Saskya et al. reported 9.8% in-hospital mortality in patients hit by the train and showed no difference in mortality compared with patients hit by an automobile [7]. In another study by Cocks RA, it reported that 35% of the patient cohort of train injuries died before reaching the hospital, with another 15.4% dying following admission to hospital [17]. Interestingly, our in-patient mortality rate is slightly higher than these reports as it does not take into account the large cohort of patients who were transferred out to other hospitals and were having a significantly less severe injury (mean ISS 6) than the admitted patients. In comparison with other injury mechanisms, patients with train-associated injuries are having higher chances of mortality. Deepa et al., in their analysis of 16,047 trauma patients, showed that railway injuries had 2.1 adjusted odds ratio for 30-day mortality compared to 1.4 for road traffic injuries [18].",

Evans et al. reported that in Great Britain, three times more trespassers were killed than passengers, railway track workers or pedestrians at legal crossings combined [3]. Many of these individuals used the railway tracks as a place to socialize, walk or rest. In developing countries, the railway tracks are frequently used as pedestrian paths in the absence of bridges, subways and other suitable road crossings. In our study, both groups had almost equal mortality, which may be due to overcrowding, illegal traveling on carriage footsteps, and rooftops, which is a common occurrence in India posing additional risk to passengers. Lerer et al. reported that several fatalities and injuries to passengers in their study were caused by risk-takers who had jumped into or out of moving trains [19].",

At platforms, falls occur during attempts of train surfing, premature boarding/ de-boarding on the train, escaping from train inspectors and so forth. This highlights the need of stringent preventive measures not only on the tracks (like manned level crossings, foot overbridges, dedicated pedestrian corridors, etc.) but also in carriages (e.g., automated doors) and at platforms (like platform screen doors). Literature characterizes preventive measures associated with railway-pedestrian safety as engineering or environmental and behavioral. There are limited studies on safety interventions in railway transportation. Most of the proposed interventions are country or culture-specific. Hav\u00e2rneanu et al. review showed that only physical barriers and media guidelines were quite sufficient, as per evidence from multiple studies in a variety of cultural contexts [20].",

Patients injured at the platform and out of the platform have the same severity of injuries, thus showing the need for safety measures and strict law enforcement both on the tracks and on the train stations. There is a need for detailed standardized event reporting for better evaluation of safety and trespasser prevention measures. Sustained governmental investment to make train travel safe in LMIC's will go a long way to reduce the added burden of mortality, morbidity and disabilities resulting from such injuries.",
