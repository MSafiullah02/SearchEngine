These 'asymptomatic' rather 'innocent blood donors' [IBD] may not even be fully aware of their viral status at the time of WB donation. We as a blood center catering to a 1,200-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in the Dehradun district of Uttarakhand, North India, wanted to deal with the issue. Therefore, we created a \"Can I Donate?\" 'A self-estimation tool [SAT] amid this pandemic to facilitate an estimation of the magnitude of the current pandemic, its implications for blood safety and to encourage self-deferral among these IBDs if they were found to be unsuitable for WB donation [Table1]. In addition, we also handed them the published SAT material to carry the same and help propagate the word amongst their peers and other potential IBDs. We believe that speedy sharing of any scientific information is an efficient tool to reduce public panic over any pandemic, including COVID-19, especially among those willing to donate their blood on a voluntary basis. As suggested by Raturi et al [5] , in addition to the otherwise existing donor screening questionnaire, the SAT content was designed and distributed by us. The awareness of COVID-19 is growing on n daily basis.

All the same, when healthy-looking 'asymptomatic' rather 'innocent blood donors' [IBDs] come forward to donate blood, they'll pose a serious threat 19]. This outbreak of COVID-19 has stomped the health care system in almost all the nations of the world[2]. Blood Transfusion Services [BTS] at every hospital, hold a prime position and insure the smooth functioning of all elective and urgent surgical interventions covering various traumas, emergency, obstetric and cancer care throughout the 24x7 duration. One of the major challenges ahead of us is to maintain high spirits and persistent enthusiasm among volunteer donors to continue donating their whole blood [WB], even during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that there might be a lot of paranoia, uncertainty and false rumors in the minds of donors about blood donation during the pandemic stage. In addition, due to government interventions, such as mass lockdown and containment measures for social gatherings, in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19, the arrangement of voluntary blood donation drives has been debarred[3]. Likewise, the general public has been reluctant to come to hospital-based blood centers to donate blood. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of blood collected globally. By calling for efforts such as public education and clarification of frequently asked questions, we believe that blood donation can be encouraged. In reality, the safety of both donors and employees should remain a priority of any BTS during this time. This implies frequent and consistent cleaning of donor stations, including surfaces with potential contamination and wearing protective face masks by donors as well as the BTS personnel. In addition, employees must be properly equipped to conform to all the requisite standards, including the donning of the personal protective equipment [PPE] and the management of biological waste produced.Furthermore, COVID-19 can exhibit in a varied manner, starting from an asymptomatic carrier state to full-blown acute respiratory illness.
