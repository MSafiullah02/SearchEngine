            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a typical form of pneumonia, was first reported in southern China in November 2002. SARS rapidly spread to 32 countries, creating panic among the public and in the World Health Organization (WHO).1, 2, 3 The initial outbreak of SARS included more than 8000 individuals diagnosed with the disease. Of these, 774 lives were claimed.4 SARS is characterized by a high fever (>38 \u00b0C), malaise, headache, rigor and a non-productive cough.5 The causative agent of SARS has been identified as a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV)6 that encodes several viral proteases that proteolyze polyproteins to yield functional proteins. One such highly conserved cysteine protease is the main protease (Mpro), also known as the dimeric chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro).7, 8, 9 3CLpro mediates the majority of proteolytic processes involved in producing two large viral polyproteins, replicases pb1a and pb1b.7, 8, 9 The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains Cys145 and His41, which together constitute a catalytic dyad in which the cysteine moiety functions as a common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.9, 10 Since SARS-CoV 3CLpro plays an important role in the virus life cycle, it has been recognized as a key target for the discovery of anti-SARS agents. Numerous SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors have been identified through chemical library screenings11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 or rational design approaches based on the active site properties.17, 18, 19, 20 These protease inhibitors include C2-symmetric peptidomimetics,11 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives,12 bifunctional arylboronic acids,13 keto-glutamine derivatives,14 isatin derivatives,15 thiophene-2-carboxylates,16 zinc conjugated compounds,17 cinanserin,18 calmodulin,19 benzotriazoles,20\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acids,21 anilide,22 and glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group.23, 24\n",

In the present study, we performed a molecular modeling study involving 1 and the 3CLpro. The study revealed the presence of a space in the S1\u2032-pocket that was larger than the size of the thiazole unit, and the N-terminal P4-moiety protruded from the binding site (Fig. 1B). Thus, P1\u2032 and P4 were sequentially optimized in a step-by-step approach that involved testing a wide variety of substructural substitutions in 1. The P2 and P1- sites were focused in parallel. As a result, some analogs were identified that exhibited potent inhibitory activity on the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Here we describe the results of these extensive studies in detail, including the design, synthesis, molecular modeling and biological evaluation of a series of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.",

The inhibitory activities (K\ni values) of compounds 5a\u2013i are listed in Table 3. Analog 5a (K\ni\n = 60 nM) showed 15-times lower activity than 2i; however, the other 5-arylated thiazoles (5b\u2013i) generally exhibited very low inhibitory activities compared to 5a, although the K\ni values of some inhibitors, including 5b, 5g\u2013i, were in the submicromolar range. These studies confirmed that the benzothiazole unit was appropriate as a warhead group for the P1\u2032-moiety.",

Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. A molecular simulation was subsequently performed. Figure 2A shows that the 2o moieties P1\u2013P3 (yellow stick) interacted with the same region of the enzyme as the lead 1. Interestingly, the benzothiazole unit occupied the S1\u2032-pocket more tightly than the smaller thiazole moiety. The minimized energies for 2o and 1 obtained from the docking study were \u221243.65 and \u221237.56 kcal/mol, respectively.32 Additionally, the 4-N,N\u2032-dimethylaminophenoxy acetyl group adopted a unique folding conformation by forming new hydrophobic interactions with \u03b1-carbon of Ala 191 at the P4 site, as shown in Figure 2B.",

A docking study of the initial lead compound 1 bound to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro provided a better understanding of the inhibitor-active site structure and interactions. These studies led to the development of several potent inhibitors, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p with IC50 or K\ni values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity, with K\ni values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. These results clearly indicated that the peptidomimetics were promising inhibitors for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics displaying potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro could be summarized as follows: (i) a benzothiazole unit was effectively accommodated as a chemical warhead by the S1\u2032-pocket; (ii) hydrogen-bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam at the S1-position; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and a size-appropriate l-leucine moiety in the S2-hydrophobic pocket and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.",

The initial rate measurements were determined as previously described using a fluorescence-based peptide cleavage assay with a commercially available fluorogenic substrate, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans (Genesis Biotech).24, 31 The change in fluorescence intensity was monitored in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) with 355 and 538 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Substrate was dissolved in deionized water, and inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO. The experiments were performed in a buffer containing10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP and 2% DMSO (pH 7.4). While varying inhibitor concentrations (0\u2013200 \u03bcM), the reaction was initiated by adding protease (final concentration 100 nM) to a solution of substrate at final concentration of 10 \u03bcM to a total volume of 120 \u03bcL in a microcuvette.
