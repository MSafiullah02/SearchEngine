The guidance state that to minimize the need for PPE, WHO recommends the \u201cuse of physical barriers to reduce exposure to the COVID-19 virus such as glass or plastic windows.\u201d",

A standard PPE for Clinician A includes a long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown, gloves, disposal face shield, N95 respirator, hair caps, and shoe covers; the barrier ensures that PPEs are preserved and can be used several times. As PPE supplies might not be able to keep up with the surge of COVID-19 patients [3], and witnessing hospitals around the world struggle with the use of their daily allotments with some even rationing their PPE to units or departments. Implementing and constructing this cost-effective approach can assist healthcare facilities in reducing their use of PPEs and not be burdened with a possible shortage in the future.",
