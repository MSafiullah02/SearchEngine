Relative survival was obtained by testing after decontamination and after storing the FFRs at 37\u00b0C and 95% relative humidity for 24 hours. The decontamination methods involved ethanol, bleach, ultraviolet irradiation (UVA 365 nm, UVC 254 nm), an autoclave, and a traditional electric rice cooker (TERC) that was made in Taiwan. Without decontamination, 59 \u00b1 8% of the loaded spores survived for 24 hours. When 70% ethanol was added to the N95 FFR at a packing density of 0.23, the RS was 73 \u00b1 5% initially and decayed to 22 \u00b1 8% in 24 hours. Relative survival remained above 20% after 20 minutes of UVA irradiation. The other four decontamination measures achieved 99%-100% biocidal efficacy, as measured immediately after the methods were applied to the test FFRs. Relative survival is a useful parameter for measuring sterilization or degree of disinfection. Bleach, UVC, an autoclave, and a TERC provide better biocidal efficacy than ethanol and UVA. Not only a higher filter quality but also a lower value of RS produced the most decontaminated FFR.",

To prevent tuberculosis, the CDC recommends that a disposable respirator can be reused by the same worker as long as it maintains its physical integrity and its proper use provides protection (exposure reduction) consistent with the assigned protection factor for respirator of its class. 1 Furthermore, NIOSH requires that, between uses, used respirators should be hung in a designated storage area or kept in a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag.",

Storage containers should be disposed of or cleaned regularly. 1 The FDA defines three kinds of reuse: between patients with adequate reprocessing, reuse by the same person with adequate reprocessing/decontamination, and repeated use by the same person over a period with or without reprocessing. 7, 8 Before FFRs are reused, they may be decontaminated to control the growth of microorganisms on them. However, whether a decontaminated N95 FFR can be reused is an issue that requires detailed consideration. In some cases, the use of chemical disinfectants may require that an employer train workers on protecting themselves against chemical hazards and on complying with OSHA's Hazard Communication, 29 CFR 1910 .1200, and other standards. 9 Contaminated objects with porous surfaces that cannot be disinfected may have to be disposed of. 9 All personnel, clothing, equipment, and samples that leave a contaminated area (generally referred to as the Exclusion Zone) must be decontaminated to remove any harmful chemicals or infectious organisms that may be attached to them. 10 Decontamination methods (i) physically remove contaminants, (ii) inactivate contaminants by chemical detoxification or disinfection/sterilization, or (iii) remove contaminants by a combination of both physical and chemical methods. 10 NIOSH has published a series of research articles on mask decontamination. [11] [12] [13] [14] In selecting decontamination methods, both decontamination and protective capability are considered. 15 For example, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and bleach reportedly do not significantly reduce the protective capability (penetration by contaminants) of FFRs. 13, 14 Bergman et al 13 tested many methods, involving UVGI and bleach, and found that FFRs that were treated with these two decontaminants and control samples exhibited expected filter aerosol penetration (<5%) and filter airflow resistance. Physical damage varied with treatment method. Further research is needed before any particular decontamination methods can be recommended.",

The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in sterile distilled water. This washing process was repeated two times, 26 and spores were resuspended in approximately 55 mL of sterile distilled water to yield a uniform mixture which was poured into the Collison nebulizer. 21 The spores were aerosolized at a pressure of 25 psi when the dilution air flow rate was 80 L/min, as presented in Figure 1 . The stability of the bioaerosol concentration in the system was verified using an Andersen single-stage sampler (Andersen Inc., Atlanta, GA). 21 The aqueous packing density (\u03b1 aq ) of the retained liquid decontaminants was modified that in a previous report, in which \u03b1 aq was the volume fraction of the filter 27 and their relative survival (RS) was calculated as follows. 21, 28, 29 where C f is the number of CFUs after decontamination and C i is the number of CFUs before decontamination (Figure 2 ). were loaded on the N95 FFR. An RS of 89 \u00b1 6% was obtained after spiking with 50% ethanol, and 73 \u00b1 5% was obtained after spiking with 70% ethanol. The lowest RS of 68 \u00b1 3% was obtained when the concentration of ethanol was 80%. The result that was obtained using 95% ethanol (RS = 73 \u00b1 7%) was close to that obtained using 70% ethanol although the samples that were spiked with 95% ethanol sometimes yielded slightly higher values of RS than were obtained using the 80% ethanol samples. An RS of 59 \u00b1 8% was obtained in 24 hours without decontamination. The 50%, 70%, 80%, and 95% ethanol-treated samples had RS values of 33 \u00b1 8%, 22 \u00b1 8%, 20 \u00b1 2% and 26 \u00b1 7% after 24 hours, respectively. Figure 4 shows the effect of 70% ethanol on the RS of B. subtilis spores. Just after spiking with ethanol, the RS was found to have declined from 100% to 68%-75%. When 0.4 mL (\u03b1 aq = 0.23) of 70% ethanol was applied, the RS fell to 22% in 24 hours. The RS fell to 20% when 80% ethanol was used.",

For example, bleach can harm the wearer if not properly used to decontaminate an N95 FFR before reuse. 15 Safe disposal of spent bleach is important, and users may decide to neutralize the microbicidal activity of the bleach before disposal. Solutions can be neutralized by reaction with chemicals such as sodium bisulfite, or glycine. 15 Considering the potential health risks, the method of decontamination using bleach must be modified such as by the use of chemical methods for neutralizing residuals. 12 The RS is a function of decontamination and the biological characteristics of pathogens. The filter quality combines penetration and pressure drop and is affected by the physical characteristics of the FFR. However, this study focused on RS because it is a useful metric for quantifying sterilization or degree of disinfection. In summary, bleach, UVC, the autoclave, and the TERC provide effective sterilization. However, ethanol and UVA are ineffective and not cleared as high-level disinfectant by US FDA. 19 A better reuse FFR has a higher filter quality and a lower RS. ",

For example, a study by Li et al revealed that the average values of RS (%) that were obtained by elution from a Nuclepore filter for hardy B. subtilis were 64% and 48% at sampling times of 1 and 30 minutes, respectively. The average RS (%) values of B. subtilis from a gelatin filter were 128% and 108% at sampling times of 1 and 30 minutes, respectively. 26 Our results were comparable to those obtained for Nuclepore filter samples.

The RS values of approximately 70%-95% (v/v) (Figure 3) that were obtained in this study support the US CDC's recommendation.The optimal bactericidal concentrations for various microorganisms may vary.15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa was destroyed by ethanol at concentrations of 30%-100%, and Serratia marcescens, E. coli, andSalmonella typhosa were destroyed by ethanol at concentrations of 40%-100%. Gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, were slightly more resistant to ethanol, being destroyed by ethanol concentrations of 60% to 95%. When the effect of ethanol against M. tuberculosis was evaluated, 95% ethanol was found to kill the tubercle bacilli in water or sputum suspension within 15 seconds. As the challenge bioaerosol in the current study is B. subtilis spore, the RS remained at 75 \u00b1 17% (Figure 7) indicating that the B. subtilis spores were more resistant than those mentioned above, including tubercle bacilli. Ethanol does not affect the viability of Bacillus spores in current guidance, 1,10,15,30 and a comprehensive examination of disinfection against different target microorganisms should therefore be performed. The average RS (%) values for hardy B. subtilis that were obtained by elution from FFRs decayed to 23 \u00b1 8% in 24 hours of treatment with 70% ethanol but to 59 \u00b1 8% without ethanol (Figure 7). The decay to 59% was caused mainly by the nature of the FFR surface and effects of storage. The combined effect of FFR surface, storage, and ethanol treatment might have been expected to yield an RS of 44% (59% \u00d7 75%), but was only 22% in this study. As ethanol should not have this much of an effect on spores, 1,10,15,30 the nature of the FFR surface, treatment with ethanol, and the storage conditions may have an interaction effect. Therefore, the mechanism by which ethanol affects the amounts of spores that survive on FFRs should be further investigated.",

Lin et al 21 found that when 1.5 mL of artificial saliva was dropped onto an N95, its surface tension caused it to form a sphere-like droplet that was attached to the hydrophobic first layer, before it slowly penetrated the second and third layers. However, in the present study, which is based on observation, 70% ethanol penetrated the filter rapidly and quickly evaporated to the air. Accordingly, increasing \u03b1 aq had little effect on the RS of B. subtilis spores and may have been responsible for the rapid evaporation of 70% ethanol.About 60%-70% of the B. subtilis spores that were loaded on N95 FFRs survived after 24 hours of storage without decontamination,",
