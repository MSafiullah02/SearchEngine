A person living in an area with high levels of pollutants is thus more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and susceptible to any infective agent (Conticini et al., 2020) . One of the potential mechanisms suggested for the association of air pollution and respiratory infections is oxidative stress induced in response to air pollutants (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) . It can affect the susceptibility and response to viral infections. Research has shown that exposure to air pollutants can reduce the ability of macrophages to phagocytise or inactivate viruses (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) . Another explanation is that exposure to air pollutants can alter the function of surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D, which are associated with enhanced susceptibility to respiratory virus infections (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) . Scientists also suggest suppression of innate immune response and an increased permeability of the pulmonary epithelium in response to exposure to air pollutants (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) .",

Analysis of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak revealed that infected people who were living in more polluted regions in China were twice as likely to die as those in less polluted areas (Cui et al., 2003) . A recent study by Conticini and colleagues indicated that a higher prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 in Northern Italy could be partly explained by exposure to a higher level of air pollution (Conticini et al., 2020) . Researchers from the United States found significant association between air pollution and COVID-19 deaths (Wu et al., 2020) . Interestingly, smoking was found to be significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness (Alraddadi et al., 2014) . A recent study among hospitalised patients of COVID-19 from China reported that smokers were fourteen times more likely to die as compared to non-smokers (Liu et al., 2020) .",

The poor, including refugees and migrant workers staying in fragile conditions, are most vulnerable (D-19 will not leave b, 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020) . They often use solid fuels for cooking and heating inside their poorly ventilated houses, without any chimneys to direct the smoke outside (Ghergu et al., 2016) . Therefore, we hypothesize that they are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Because of a lack of readily available evidence, the policymakers may not prioritise specific actions for this group. However, an outbreak of COVID-19 in a place where the concept of physical distancing is next to impossible could easily overwhelm the public health system. From a research perspective, there is a need for epidemiological studies to explore the association between exposure to biomass smoke and COVID-19. Strong public health actions, including syndromic surveillance and rigorous testing, must be performed in such communities. Persons with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of COVID-19 should without any delay report to the concerned authorities. The existing scheme to provide the poor with improved cookstoves and cleaner fuels should become a top priority in the long run.",
