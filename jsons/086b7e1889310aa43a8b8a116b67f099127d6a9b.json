Water types included in this table are drinking water (including bottled water), surface water, groundwater, and wastewater. The most frequently reported bacteria were Escherichia coli.. followed by the coliform group. These indicator bacteria are included in this review because of their use as indicators of pathogens. Attempts were made to correlate the presence of coliform bacteria with pathogens, such as Salmonella. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Aeromonas hydrophila (Martinez-Manzanares et al.; O'Shea and Field; Stelzer and Jacob; and Townsend) . The correlation between salmonella and coliform June 1993 bacteria or enterococci was unclear in a survey of two pools in the Australian wet-dry tropics (Townsend) , in an estuary of a river in Spain (Martinez-Manzanares et al.) , and in storm water runoff (O'Shea and Field). V. parahaemolyticus and A. hydrophila in shellfish were correlated with total coliforms (Martinez-Manzanares et al. ) , and aeromonads increased relative to coliforms in treated drinking water (Stelzer et at.) .",

Viable but nonculturable organisms present a problem when detecting organisms in water (McCarty et al.; McKay; and Singh and McFeters) . Preenrichment and selective enrichment of samples, as well as the newer technologies of gene probes and immunoassays, improve the detection of injured and stressed organisms. Methods for quantifying pathogens continue to improve, resulting in improved detection of stressed and injured organisms and reducing the time committed to identification (Bifulco and Schaefer; Covert et al.; Jacob and Stelzer; Oliver et al.; and Warburton et al.) .",

An extensive overview of gene probe technology was published during 1992 (Atlas et al.) . Immunoassays can detect toxins produced by organisms or the organisms themselves, however, viability determination of the detected cells is not reliable. (Brown et al.) A new technology that shows promise is the combined use of conductance and immunology (Parmar et al.v . Beads coated with the antigen for a specific pathogen are exposed to the organism. After a short incubation, the beads are separated, washed, and resuspended in broth. The change in conductance of the broth is measured, and the resulting curve is specific for the organism. Salmonella typhimurium can be detected from a preenrichment broth within 14 hours using this method (Parmar et al.) . The sensitivity of the immunobead assay is yet to be determined, specialized equipment is necessary, and competition Table 4 -0etection of waterborne pathogens.",

            "text": "Reginald Goo MONITORING Effluent monitoring data collected under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program were used to estimate Priority Pollutant loads to the San Francisco Estuary (Davis et al. ) Chromium, copper, nickel, and zinc from four municipal wastewater treatment facilities accounted for approximately 50% of the total loads for these elements to the Estuary. Silver concentrations were measured in coastal surface waters in the Southern California Bight (Sai'iudo-Wilhelmy and Flegal). Based on mass balance calculations, anthropogenic silver inputs from the Point Lorna discharge off San Diego, Calif., account for essentially all of the silver in coastal waters along the United States-Mexico border during summer conditions. Grimalt et al. reported a study of a sediment sampling network encompassing six coastline perpendicular transects, each situated in front ofa river mouth. Variance analysis has shown this type of sampling scheme can recognize the main coastal pollution discharge sites, but is not useful for tracing their area of influence.Aichinger et al. used electrolytic respirometry to measure the biodegradability of six phthalate esters and four polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Dissolution appeared to govern the degradation rate when these compounds were present in amounts exceeding their solubility. Alexander and Fu found microbial mineralization of styrene rapid in wastewater and certain types 300 of soil. They suggested that styrene will be rapidly destroyed by biodegradation in most aerobic environments and the rate may be slow in environments of low pH. Chaudhuri et al. studied the effect oftemperature on the incubation time in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) tests. They concluded that BOD s. 2o is equivalent to BOD 3 \u2022 27 and should be used in tropical countries.Fendlinger et al. published an analytical method for the determination of alkyl sulfate surfactants in natural waters. Their monitoring results indicated that alkyl sulfate surfactants removal is similar to BOD removal and was at least 90% at two trickling filter wastewater treatment plants sampled. Field et al. published a method for the determination of sulfonated aliphatic and aromatic surfactants in wastewater sludge. Concentrations of secondary alkanesulfonate and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants in wastewater sludges ranged from 0.27 to 0.80 and from 3.83 to 7.51 g/kg, respectively.Comprehensive air emission tests were conducted on two multiple-hearth incinerators (Hentz et al.) . Lead and cadmium control efficiencies were significantly higher than those assumed in proposed regulations. Despite low sludge concentrations and high control efficiencies, arsenic and cadmium emissions are expected to exceed limits proposed in recent regulations. Huang et al. reported dibromopolychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibromopolychlorodibenzofurans characterization in municipal waste incinerator fly ash. Concentrations of these compounds ranged from low to high parts per trillion depending on the location where the samples were collected.Brodbelt proposed an interface for on-line process monitoring of gas and liquid samples using a mass spectrometer that was applied to freon, benzene, and pentachloropyridine.",

Theoretical calculations showed that sampling strategies with evenly spaced sampling intervals may systematically over or underestimate the true loading. Characteristics of the collected data, relative influence of point sources, and desired detail of loading estimates influence the choice of the estimation method. Martin et al. compared surface-grab and cross-sectionally integrated sampling methods for determining stream water quality. Surface grab samples underrepresented concentrations of suspended sediments and some sediment-associated constituents.Foreman et al. encountered analytical interference from mercuric chloride-preserved water samples. This interference occurred in the continuous liquid-liquid extracts that were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Poor recoveries of spiked samples were observed when using a closed-loop stripping method. Clement described a classroom experiment that illustrates sampling difficulties and analytical errors that can occur in trace environmental determinations. A practical guide for environmental sampling and analysis was presented by Keith.",
