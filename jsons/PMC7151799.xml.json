Diarrhea is considered acute if it lasts for less than 14 days, and chronic when it persists for more than 14 days. Acute, self-limiting diarrhea is a relatively common problem in dogs and cats and usually requires minimal diagnostic testing and therapy. In contrast to most animals with acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea can be particularly challenging to diagnose, because most animals will not respond to empirical therapies, necessitating a well-formulated and cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic plan. Specific therapeutic modalities are based upon a definitive diagnosis or histologic characterization of intestinal biopsies.",

These secondary signs include abdominal distention, abdominal pain, borborygmus, dehydration, flatulence, halitosis, melena, hematochezia, polydipsia, polyphagia, tenesmus, vomiting, and weight loss. Animals may present with alterations in appetite ranging from polyphagia to anorexia, and these same alterations in food intake can be recognized as a consequence of disease progression (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and lymphoma). Weight loss is often associated with nutrient malabsorption of diffuse mucosal disease. Vomiting can be associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and is relatively common in animals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Colorectal disorders are often associated with tenesmus, dyschezia, and large bowel diarrhea characterized by hematochezia, increased mucus on feces, marked increase in defecation frequency, and a reduction in fecal volume.",

            "text": "Osmotic diarrhea is caused by unusually large amounts of poorly absorbable osmotically active solutes in the intestinal lumen. Osmotic diarrhea occurs with malabsorptive disorders where nutrients are maldigested or malabsorbed, remain within the intestinal lumen, and osmotically attract water. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is an example of an osmotic diarrheal disorder. Retention of nutrients can lead to alterations in intestinal microflora and fermentation of carbohydrates, further increasing numbers of osmotically active particles. The fecal water output in osmotic diarrhea is directly related to fecal output of the solute or solutes that are exerting an osmotic gradient across intestinal mucosa. Electrolyte absorption is unaffected by these osmotically active substances, and fecal water typically contains very little unabsorbed sodium or potassium.2 This is the basis for the calculation of the \u201cfecal osmotic gap.\u201d In this calculation, the difference between luminal osmolality (equal to body fluid osmolality, approximately 290 mOsm/kg, because the colon cannot maintain an osmotic gradient against plasma) and osmolality of luminal contents contributed by fecal electrolytes is estimated. The contribution of fecal electrolytes is calculated as twice the sum of sodium and potassium ions to account for the anions that accompany these cations. A fecal osmotic gap greater than 50 mOsm/kg suggests osmotic diarrhea.2 One of the major hallmarks of osmotic diarrhea is that diarrhea resolves when the patient stops ingesting the poorly absorbable solute.",

The most common cause of secretory diarrhea in dogs and cats are abnormal mediators resulting in changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), calcium, and/or protein kinases, which in turn cause a decrease in neutral sodium chloride absorption or an increase in chloride secretion.3 Such mediators include endogenous enteric hormones or neuropeptides, inflammatory cell products, bacterial enterotoxins, laxatives, fatty acids, and bile acids (see Chapters 1 and 57Chapter 1Chapter 57 for more detail). Secretory diarrhea has two important distinguishing features; first, fecal osmolality can be accounted for by sodium, potassium, and their accompanying anions, and thus the osmotic gap is small; and second, the diarrhea usually persists despite fasting because the diarrhea is caused by abnormalities in ion transport that have nothing to do with food. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and IBD are examples of secretory diarrheas.",

Many cases of chronic diarrhea can manifest initially as acute diarrhea. Localization of the disease process into \u201csmall bowel\u201d versus \u201clarge bowel\u201d has some limitations, as many diarrheal diseases with primary manifestations of one compartment (large bowel or small bowel) may have diffuse gastrointestinal (GI) involvement (large and small bowel). This point is underscored by a study in 40 dogs suggesting that routine collection of ileal biopsies is warranted in dogs with colonopathy, and that routinely sampling of duodenum and ileum increases the diagnostic yield compared to biopsy of one anatomic site.6 Regardless, the initial differentiation into small and large bowel components helps to further clarify the medical investigation (see Figure 11-1, Figure 11-2\n).Box 11-1Differential Diagnoses for Acute and Chronic DiarrheaDifferential diagnoses for acute and chronic diarrhea in dogs and cats, with annotation of potentially life-threatening causes of disease.DietaryAbrupt dietary change*Overeating*Dietary indiscretion*Dietary intolerance/allergy\u2021\nInflammatoryInflammatory bowel disease\u2020\nAntibiotic-responsive diarrhea\u2020\nLymphangiectasia\u2020\nHemorrhagic gastroenteritis # ,*InfectiousParasitic helminths,\u2021 protozoa\u2021\nBacterial Salmonella,#,* Campylobacter,* Clostridium perfringens,#,* Clostridium difficile,#,* E. coli,#\n,*Viral parvovirus,#,* coronavirus,* feline leukemia virus (FeLV),\u2020 feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)\u2020\nFungal histoplasmosis,#,\u2020\nPythium,#,\u2020 cryptococcosis#,\u2020\nRickettsial salmon poisoning#,*Extraintestinal DisordersPancreatitis#,*Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency\u2020\nLiver disease#,\u2021\nKidney disease#,\u2021\nHypoadrenocorticism#,\u2021\nHyperthyroidism\u2020\nFunctional Ileus/Mechanical ObstructionMiscellaneousToxemia (pyometra, peritonitis)#,*Septicemia (leptospirosis)#,\u2021\nApudomas (gastrinomas, VIPomas, carcinoid syndrome)#,\u2021\nNeoplasticCarcinoma#,\u2021\nMast cell tumors#,\u2021\nLeiomyosarcomas (gastrointestinal stromal tumors)#,\u2021\nLymphoma#,\u2021\nDrugs and ToxinsNonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs\u2021\nAntibiotics\u2021\nDigoxin\u2021\nCancer chemotherapeutics\u2021\nCopper chelators\u2021\nKey: #, potentially life-threatening; *, typically associated with acute diarrhea; \u2020, typically associated with chronic diarrhea; \u2021, associated with acute or chronic diarrhea.",

History should ensure that systemic causes of diarrhea are not overlooked. A comprehensive history should also identify important predisposing factors (e.g., exposure to parasites, infectious agents, drugs, toxins). It is equally important to fully characterize the nature of diarrhea and appearance of feces (Table 11-1\n). For dogs with a history of tenesmus, it is pivotal to determine whether signs are secondary to colitis or to a discrete mass or polyp in the colorectal region. The latter is often associated with a change in the appearance of the stool (\u201cribbon-like,\u201d \u201cpencil-thin\u201d) in the absence of a marked increase in frequency of bowel movements or increased fecal mucus as seen with colitis. Likewise, absence of clinical signs of diarrhea does not rule out severe underlying intestinal disease; dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) may have anorexia and weight loss without associated vomiting and diarrhea.

Abdominal palpation is performed for detection of mass lesions, thickened bowel loops (neoplasia, intussusception, IBD, fungal enteropathies, mesenteric lymphadenopathy), or pain (bowel inflammation, pancreatitis, peritonitis, ischemia of bowel, and gas-associated bowel distention). In cats the thyroid region should be carefully palpated for thyroid nodules, and the kidneys and liver examined for changes in size and contour. Digital rectal palpation is important for detection of rectal masses or irregular thickening of rectal wall, colorectal strictures, and collection of feces for gross inspection and further evaluation. Digital rectal palpation of the rectum in cats is usually performed under general anesthesia or deep sedation. Macroscopic examination of a fresh fecal specimen is essential for assessment of bulk, color, consistency, detection of blood and mucus, and detection of foreign material. Small bowel diarrhea is generally free of grossly visible mucus or red blood, but prominent steatorrhea may cause the feces to appear lighter in color. Acholic or pale feces can also be seen in association with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction causing a lack of the bile pigment stercobilin in the feces.

Pancreatic acinar atrophy predominantly affects dogs between 1 and 5 years of age, although it also may occur in older dogs. Pancreatic insufficiency is rare in cats, and occurs as a consequence of chronic, intermittent bouts of pancreatitis in this species. In contrast to most dogs with the disease, cats often have loss of both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function, and are thus typically diabetic as well. The optimal test for the diagnosis of EPI in dogs and cats is a species-specific assay of trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI). Assay of fecal proteolytic activity (PA) using an azoprotein- or casein-based method can also be used, but it is not as sensitive as the TLI assay and is more impractical to perform.

Elimination diets contain single, novel protein sources, whereas hypoallergenic diets contain hydrolyzed protein sources that have been enzymatically hydrolyzed into polypeptides. Although more expensive and less palatable, hydrolyzed diets are particularly beneficial as elimination diets for the diagnosis and management of food hypersensitivity, when a patient appears to be allergic to multiple allergens, when a complicated dietary history makes it difficult to identify a \u201cnovel\u201d protein, or when a patient has severe IBD.22 The supplementation of fermentable fiber sources such as psyllium or oat bran may be necessary in patients with IBD involving the large intestine that show partial resolution of their clinical signs. The gelling and binding properties of fatty acids and deconjugated bile acids in fermentable fibers may be beneficial in certain gastrointestinal diseases. The use of fermentable fiber in preference to nonfermentable fiber is generally advocated because most soluble fibers generate butyrate, the principal source of energy for the colonocyte, and other short-chain fatty acids. Short-chain fatty acids may lower the colonic luminal pH, impeding the growth of pathogens.23 The health benefits derived from dietary supplementation of prebiotics have yet to be fully recognized in dogs and cats with chronic diarrhea, although prebiotic administration has been shown to decrease the concentrations of fecal ammonia and amines and increased the numbers of bifidobacteria in dog feces.24\n",

Marked dietary fat restriction is one of the most important aspects in the management of dogs with intestinal lymphangiectasia. Diets that are highly digestible and that contain less than 20% fat calories on a metabolic equivalent basis are recommended.27 The author recommends feeding of a premium commercial-based diet if possible; however, there are a small number of dogs with severe lymphangiectasia that will need further fat restriction than available in commercial diets, and home-cooked diets are warranted. These home-cooked diets should be made up by a veterinary nutritionist to ensure that the diets are complete and balanced. Dogs with concurrent IBD and lymphangiectasia are more challenging to manage from a dietary perspective because these animals need a novel, select protein source diet that is also markedly fat restricted and virtually no commercial diet fits these criteria. An alternative to consider is the use of hypoallergenic diets containing hydrolyzed protein sources and moderate amounts of dietary fat. Failure to respond favorably to these diets warrants a home-cooked diet that is more fat-restricted and contains a novel, select protein source. Administration of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to enhance the caloric density of the diet is controversial because of unpleasant taste and potential for inducing diarrhea. MCTs are not transported entirely via the portal circulation to the liver and can exacerbate lymphangiectasia.",

A recent study documented the ability of the probiotic organism Enterococcus faecium SF68 (Forta-Flora, Nestle-Purina, St. Louis, MO) to antagonize Giardia intestinalis infection in mice.34 Oral feeding of E. faecium strain SF68 starting 7 days before inoculation with Giardia trophozoites significantly increased production of specific anti-Giardia intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) A and blood IgG. This humoral response was mirrored at the cellular level by an increased percentage of CD4(+) T cells in Peyer patches and spleens of SF68-fed mice. Improvement of specific immune responses in probiotic-fed mice was associated with a diminution in the number of active trophozoites in small intestine as well as decreased shedding of fecal Giardia antigens (GSA65 protein). A recent study evaluating efficacy of E. faecium SF68 in 20 adult dogs with chronic naturally acquired giardiasis failed to affect cyst shedding or antigen content and did not alter innate or adaptive immune responses.35 Additional studies are warranted in dogs and cats to further assess the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics and to evaluate their safety. The latter issue is particularly important given the recent finding of increased intestinal adhesion of Campylobacter jejuni in an in vitro model of canine intestinal mucus following incubation with E. faecium.36 It should be noted that this E. faecium strain is different from the E. faecium SF68 strain available commercially; moreover, there has been no clinical or anecdotal evidence of Campylobacter-associated diarrhea in dogs administered probiotics to date.",
