The AUC of the model is 0.911.The high risk factors for developing to severe COVID-19 are: age R 55 years, BMI > 27 kg / m 2 , IL-6 R 20 pg / ml, CD4 + T cell % 400 count / m L.Among 249 discharged COVID-19 patients, those who recovered after 20 days had a lower count of platelet, a higher level of estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher level of interleukin-6 and myoglobin than those who recovered within 20 days.",

Most of the mild patients with COVID-19 had symptoms such as fever, cough, and mild pneumonia, whereas the critical cases presented dyspnea, respiratory failure, sepsis, organ dysfunction, and even eventual death. [3] [4] [5] Therefore, we hypothesize that the clinical and laboratory characteristics may be associated with patients' severity and short-term outcomes. A large cohort study indicated that the total mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2.3%; however, the rate of severe cases was 8.1% while that of critical cases reached 14%. 6 In particular, patients with complications, such as septic shock and organ dysfunction, had the highest mortality rate. 4, 5 The median length of severe patients' aggravation period was 10 days. 5 Without specific antiviral agents, an early intervention and supportive treatments are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing mortality in severe patients.",

The sample consisted of 198 males (47.5%) and 219 females (52.5%), but the sex ratio was skewed toward males in the severe-critical group (64.1%).

Other symptoms that were not common included expectoration (3.1%), headache (3.4%), myalgia (3.2%), chill (0.7%), nausea or vomiting (0.2%), and diarrhea (2.6%). Most symptom profiles were comparable between the mild-moderate group (n = 325) and the severe-critical group (n = 92) while fever and cough occurred in a significantly higher proportion among severely to critically ill patients (p < 0.001 for fever and p = 0.015 for cough).

Patients with a CD4 + T lymphocyte level of %400/mL showed a lower median probability of progressing to severe-critical status (62.52%) than those with a level >400/mL. Patients with level of IL-6 R20 pg/mL were more likely to develop into a severely to critically ill case (median probability 70.01%) than those whose level was lower than 20 pg/mL (3.80%). Patients aged R55 years had a higher probability of developing into a severe-critical case (41.15%) than those younger than 55 (1.73%). The logistic regression model was then retrained with two separate ranges under these four variables. For model validation, we applied a repeated k-fold cross-validation method of 10-fold with 10 repeats. Values of R 2 , root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used for model performance evaluation. Results showed R 2 = 0.596, MAE = 0.21, and RMSE = 0.31. In the end, we predicted the probability for each of 16 (2 4 = 16) types of initial test results, shown in Figure 2 . These results represent potential indicators for early initial auxiliary prediction.

Accurate prediction of disease progression for COVID-19 patients is therefore urgent to facilitate appropriate clinical decision making and optimized medical resource allocations. Risk stratification management will help to alleviate burdens of insufficient medical resources and further reduce mortality. 12 Our current research showed that there were significant differences between the mild-moderate group and the severe-critical group concerning several epidemiological and clinical features (age, gender, and fever). Results were consistent with previous reports that age, gender, and underlying diseases might be associated with disease severity. 4, 9 In terms of laboratory data, 18 out of 27 tested baseline parameters, including levels of blood cells, indicators of myocardial zymogram, liver and renal function, indicators of coagulation function, and levels of infection-related biomarkers were significantly different between the two groups. Hence, we recommended four parameters-age, BMI, and levels of CD4 + T lymphocytes and IL-6-as predictors in future multivar-iate regression analysis. The elderly (R55 years), a high level of BMI (>27 kg/m 2 ), a low level of CD4 + T lymphocytes (%400/mL), and a high level of IL-6 (R20 pg/mL) are markers associated with the progression to severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients.",

This finding was in line with results showing BMI as an independent risk factor that could predict the incidence of pneumonia among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the hospitalized patients. Severe patients showed more prominent laboratory abnormalities, including lymphocytopenia and leukopenia, than mild ones. 6 Among the severe-critical cohort, we also observed lower levels of lymphocytes and CD4 + T lymphocytes. Those with a level of CD4 + T lymphocytes at or below 400/mL suffered a higher risk of progression to severe cases. The cytokine storm caused by a vigorous immune response against the virus was a significant predicting factor for the severity of viral pneumonia. Plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-g-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemotattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, and tumor necrosis factor a in COVID-19 were higher in intensive care unit (ICU) cases than non-ICU cases. 4 Being one of the important cytokines, IL-6 could complement the function of CD8 + T lymphocytes and might aggravate the clinical course. 14 Compared with other cytokines, IL-6 is more widely used and more meaningful clinically.",

Following standard protocols released by Chinese CDC, RNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with SARS-CoV-2-specific primers and probes in level-2 biosafety facilities at Shenzhen CDC.1 In addition to treatment outcomes, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological profiles of all patients were followed up. Data were sorted into standardized data collection forms and then reviewed by experienced physicians. We defined the \"onset date\" as the day when symptoms appeared. For patients without initial symptoms, the onset date was defined as the day of admission.According to the WHO interim guidance, 15 all COVID-19 patients were diagnosed and classified into mild to critical pneumonia cases.The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued the seventh version of COVID-19 Treatment Guideline, in which patients were also categorized into mild, moderate (typical), severe, and critically ill cases.16",
