These proteins are characterized by a remarkable functional diversity, being involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative detoxification, DNA damage repair, stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, cell metabolism, angiogenesis, cardiac development, aging and others. In addition, FOXO have critical implications in both normal and cancer stem cell biology. New strategies to modulate FOXO expression and activity may now be developed since the discovery of novel FOXO regulators and non-coding RNAs (such as microRNAs) targeting FOXO transcription factors. This review focuses on physiological and pathological functions of FOXO proteins and on their action as fine regulators of cell fate and context-dependent cell decisions. A better understanding of the structure and critical functions of FOXO transcription factors and tumor suppressors may contribute to the development of novel therapies for cancer and other diseases.",

Interestingly, up to now, FOX genes have not been identified in plants 8 . However, an update published in 2010 reported that are 50 FOX genes identified and classified in the human genome and 44 in the mouse genome 9 . Therefore, a standard nomenclature system was required for this extended number of discovered factors. In 2000, Daniel E. Martinez and his team established Fox Nomenclature Committee, the first step towards an unified nomenclature for the winged-helix / forkhead transcription factors. The Committee has changed the initial terms for the forkhead proteins (e.g. FREAC -Forkhead RElated Activator; fkh -Drosophila gene fork head) 7 . Currently, based on phylogenetic analysis, FOXO genes are classified in subclasses that range from FOXA to FOXS to yield 23 subclasses in total 10, 11, 12, 13 . Each subclass has several members noted with an arabic number. While for human forkhead proteins abbreviations have all letters in uppercase (e.g., FOXD3), for mouse only the first letter is capitalized (e.g., Foxd3) and for all other chordates the first and subclass letter are in uppercase (e.g., FoxD3) 7 .",

Analysis of the amino acid sequences alignment of FOXO proteins revealed a highly conserved DNA binding domain among all the members of the broader group of forkhead transcription factors, but also among species, in eukaryotic organisms, from yeast to humans 3, 27 . Moreover, several studies point out that forkhead DBD is not the only region in the FOXO molecule that is highly conserved. Similarities were also observed in the N-terminal region near the first AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation site (Thr24 for FOXO1 and Thr32 for FOXO3), the region containing NLS, and sequences from C-terminal transactivation domain 25 . As mentioned above, the forkhead domains in FOXO subclass of FOX family are similar to the forkhead regions of other subclasses. For example, structural similarities have been proven in the core region of FOXO3 compared to FOXA3, FOXK1 and FOXP2 28 . The forkhead/winged helix motif is a shared sequence between subclasses of FOXO, of around 100 amino acids that folds into three alphahelices (H1, H2 and H3), three beta-strands (S1, S2 and S3) and two wing-like loops (W1 and W2). The structure has a H1 -S1 -H2 -H3 -S2 -W1 -S3 -W2 topology and the strands S1, S2 and S3 interact with each other forming a beta-sheet. While the N-terminal part of the domain is formed by a cluster of three alpha-helices, the C-terminal half consists of beta strands S2 and S3 and two large loops (wings W1 and W2) 25 . The main DNA recognition site is represented by the highly conserved helix H3 of forkhead DNA-binding domain. The stability of forkhead DBD -DNA complexes is increased by the more variable regions of the DBD, including H1, the region between H2 and H3, wing W1 and C-terminal segment 25 .",

Upregulation of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) by increased levels of FOXO1 or FOXO3 in cancer cells, such as prostate carcinoma cells, leads to apoptosis 58 . Thus, binding of Fas ligand (FasL) and TRAIL to their receptors (Fas/CD95/APO-1 for FasL and DR4, DR5 for TRAIL) triggers a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with a subsequent activation of caspases, mainly initiator caspase 8 and effector caspase 3, leading to apoptosis 59 .

In response to DNA damage, FOXO transcription factors increase the expression levels of the CDK inhibitors binding to cyclin/CDK complexes, such as p21 (also known as CDK inhibitor 1) and p27 (Kip1) 63,64 . CDK inhibitors together with FOXO-induced inhibition of Cyclins expression act by stopping the cell cycle at different checkpoints in order to repair the DNA damage or to remove the damaged cell 65 . For example, a study performed on 32D murine myeloid cells and on BaF3 murine pre-B-cell lines brings evidence that endogenous FOXO proteins are required to enforce cell cycle checkpoints after The cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition is induced by FOXO by upregulating the negative regulators of the G1/S phase, such as the CDK inhibitors: p27 KIP1 , p57 KIP2 , p21 CIP1/WAF1 (CIP/KIP family), p15 INK , p19 INK (INK family) and the retinoblastoma protein family member p130 27 .Also, FOXO decreases the positive regulators, such as cyclin D1, or cyclin D2, blocking the G1/S transition 66 . Additionally, FOXO increases the expression of negative regulators such as Gadd45alpha and cyclin G2, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G2/M 66 . Surprisingly, FOXO proteins act as transcription factors for PLK1 expression during cell cycle, PLK1 being critical in promoting G2-M phase transition, M phase progression and end of mitosis 67 . A complete knock-down of FOXO protein levels induces an arrest in cell cycle, suggesting that a basal, low levels of FOXOs activity is required for the cell cycle progression 67 . Surprisingly, in specific settings, FOXO may actually serve as a promoter of proliferation. For example, neutrophils isolated from FOXO3 deficient mice show high levels of FasL expression and apoptosis, revealing that FOXO3 may represses FasL expression in neutrophils, leading to proliferation in this type of cells 68 . FOXO1 was also shown to positively influence proliferation induction in pancreatic \u03b2 cells in vitro, under low nutritional circumstances. The mechanisms implicated in this process are not completely understood. However, the induction of Ccnd1 gene transcription, which encodes Cyclin D1, may at least partially be involved. Cyclin D1 represents one of the earliest cell cycle-related events, being critical for the G1 to S phase progression during the cell cycle 34 .",

Studies on human cardiac fibroblasts revealed that FOXO also modulate the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin III, fighting against cell damage induced by oxidative stress.

Thus, cellular lifespan maintenance requires a certain level of FOXOs activity and this is mainly achieved by inactivation of AKT activity 88 . FOXO proteins do not only play an important protective role during senescence/aging, but also during exercise. It was previously suggested that FOXOs may at least partially be involved in the exerciseinduced beneficial cardiac effects. Interestingly, exercise induces an upregulation of FOXO3 and SIRT1 in the heart, with subsequent increased MnSOD, catalase and GAD45alpha, and decreased Cyclin D2, suggesting the protective role of FOXO proteins 89 .",

Additional reports suggest that suppression of FOXO proteins expression during oxidative stress can be protective to some extent for cells, since protein inhibition or gene knockdown of FOXO1 and FOXO3 decreases the ischemic infarct size in the brain, protects the metabotropic glutamate receptors during vascular injury, enhances pancreatic \u03b2-cell or neuronal survival through NAD + precursors and provide trophic factor protection with erythropoietin (EPO) and neurotrophins 20 . This suggests that while a certain level of FOXO3 activation is required in cellular stress resistance, sustained activation or activation over a threshold of FOXO3 is detrimental and may induce apoptosis. Thus, FOXO3 plays an important role in cellular decision during stress, helping the cells to survive by multiple mechanisms (such as DNA repair, ROS inactivation etc) and inducing apoptosis when DNA or cellular damage can't be repaired.

Cell type-specific deletions of FOXO1 and/or FOXO3 in mice revealed an important role of FOXO proteins in regulating immunological homeostasis and tolerance, by controlling the function and development of B and T lymphocytes. Thus, FOXO1 and FOXO3 are essential transcription factors involved in early B cell development and peripheral B cell function, since early deletion of FOXO1 blocked B cell differentiation at the pro-B cell stage. This is due to a defect in interleukin 7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ralpha) expression. Deletion of FOXO1 in peripheral B cells was associated with defective expression of both CD62L and AID, with subsequent failure in class-switch recombination and reduced IgG production upon immunization. Moreover, it is known that the PI3K-AKT-mediated inactivation of FOXO1 is essential for the optimal proliferation of B cells, while ectopic expression of PI3K-independent variants of FOXO1 or FOXO3 (active triple mutants at the AKT phosphorylation sites) resulted in cell cycle arrest and increased cell death in B cells 90 . Another study on mice with T cell-specific deletion of FOXO1 showed a decreased expression of IL-7 receptor on mature T-cells, suggesting that IL7-R is a transcriptional target of FOXO1, which is mediating through binding with IL-7 the survival and homeostatic proliferation of peripheral T cell 91 .",

Thus, FOXO1-mediated expression of G6Pase and PEPCK is critical for gluconeogenesis in the liver during fasting, but its deregulation may be involved in diabetes etiology 111 . Physiological functions of FOXO take place under certain circumstances, since sometimes the ability to maintain the proper control is overwhelmed 20 . Experiments on insulin-producing mouse pancreatic beta cells (betaTC-6) show that chronic exposure to high glucose activates FOXO transcription factors and leads to upregulation of endogenous inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS). These events trigger the activation of caspase-3 with subsequent apoptosis, suggesting a new mechanism that leads to the destruction of endocrine pancreas in type 2 diabetes 92 . Also, exposure to high glucose of the cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) isolated from hearts of adult rats show that FOXO transcription factors leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and apoptosis, suggesting that FOXOs might be involved in microvascular complications of diabetes 93 . FOXO is also involved in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, since the activation of FOXO1 in cardiomyocytes leads to increased AKT activity and attenuated cellular response to insulin, followed by decreased glucose uptake 112 .",
