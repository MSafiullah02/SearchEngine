Noteworthy, 6.1% of 1072 MS patients treated with disease-modifying drugs in our MS Center had a SARS-COV-2 infection, with an exponential increase since February 26 till March 26 (from 0.37% to 5.78% of the patients\u2019 cohort). Therefore, promptly activating remote support was necessary to communicate with patients and support the individuals in critical conditions; this approach resulted to be very appreciated, as 1071 out of 1246 (86%) who answered to a survey felt they had a comprehensive support. In particular, emails were sent to provide instructions about protection from infection and isolation to prevent familiar contagion; specific emails were sent to patients prescribed with ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine to reinforce their motivation for conscious self-protection. In addition, blood tests and MRI were checked via mail, although direct telephone contact was the patients' preferred mean of relating to health personnel, especially for the management of febrile cases and respiratory symptoms. Maintaining telephone contact with home patients twice a day to record respiratory parameters and the thermal curve was of crucial importance to avoid access to the emergency room and to address only critical cases to hospital care.",

Nonetheless, mailing and telephone calls resulted to be essential to monitor and treat behavioral disturbances or delirium in dementia patients and motor deficit in Parkinson disease. Neuropsychological formal evaluations were performed from remote by sharing tests\u2019 tools not requiring specific material handling. MS patients, post-stroke, and post-traumatic brain-injured patients with cognitive impairment were tested. Speech and cognitive trainings were provided by prescribing exercises, accessible from the cloud by either the psychologist\u2014to interact with patients\u2019 activity\u2014or the patients, often with the help of a caregiver.",
