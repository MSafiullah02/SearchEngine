In most patients, the duration of symptomatology is three to six days.

In a typical year, seasonal influenza causes widespread illness and approximately 30,000 deaths in the United States alone. These seasonal influenza epidemics are caused by slight mutations in the influenza virus. During these outbreaks, people may have some residual immunity from exposure to previously circulating influenza strains or cross-subtype immunity from seasonal influenza vaccinations.6\n",

Operating Rooms (ORs) and Post Anesthesia Care Units (PACUs) are often designated surge areas within a health care facility. They are designated surge areas primarily because of their physical layout: ORs and PACUs have oxygen and gas hookups, suction, and monitoring capabilities. Additionally, many PACUs are staffed with nurses who have critical care background/training and/or are currently ACLS certified. However, having a critical care background does not mean that the PACU nurse feels competent and capable of caring for a surge patient.",

Some supplies will be available to health care facilities from the federal Strategic National Stockpile; however, these \u201cpush packages\u201d are delivered to the state level, and it may take time for the supplies to arrive at the local facility requesting the items.16 As such, par levels should be increased for critical items, in anticipation of high use and broken supply chains.",

A recent qualitative study examining nurses' beliefs and concerns during public health emergencies revealed an overwhelming fear of abandonment. Nurses believed the clinical settings would be chaotic, with unmanageable numbers of patients and inadequate supplies of PPE. Loss of freedom to leave the hospital and fears that the hospital would not provide treatment to front-line nurses who became ill contributed to nurses' sense of abandonment.17 Cross-training staff and exploring modified staffing patterns (such as a two-tiered nursing approach in caring for critically ill patients in surge areas with non-critical care nurses) are strongly encouraged so that adequate planning and buy-in can occur before a crisis mandates these actions. Depending on the extent of the pandemic, routine non-urgent activities may be suspended and redeployment of staff instituted to enhance surge capacity and reinforce existing staffing.",

Additionally, H1N1 appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. At the present time, the virus strain appears to cause very mild illness. But scientists are always concerned about the intrinsic mutability of influenza viruses. At the time of publication, there is no way to know if the pandemic threat will erupt or evaporate. In any event, the following are modest recommendations based on the knowledge we have today and the evolving threat of 2009 H1N1:\u2022Regularly check the CDC website for updates, recommendations, and pandemic flu planning tools (www.cdc.gov).\u2022Practice good hand hygiene frequently and teach friends and family members to do the same.\u2022Practice respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, such as covering your mouth with the \u201cantecube hook\u201d when coughing. This simple change in habit reduces the viral load on your hands.\u2022Do not go to work sick. If you have children, do not send them to preschool/school if they are sick. Voluntary isolation helps to stop the spread of the virus to others.\u2022Implement social distancing measures, such as avoiding crowded settings.18\n\u2022Keep yourself up to date with the latest information. Family members, friends, and consumers will look to you for information. Sir Francis Bacon said, \u201cKnowledge is power.\u201d A corollary to that maxim is that ignorance is fear. Keep abreast of the evolving situation and share the information freely with others.\u2022Get vaccinated with the annual flu vaccine. An unvaccinated HCW is an at-risk HCW because viral shedding occurs before influenza symptoms present themselves. This puts all of the patients for whom you care at risk.19\n\u2022Get involved on your hospital-wide disaster planning committee.\u2022Do not keep exotic pets, as they provide reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens and opportunities for microbial transmission.20\n\n",
