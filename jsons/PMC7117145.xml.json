            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a serious disease of domestic and wild Felidae. It is an important disease of cats in multi-cat households, catteries, and shelters (Scott et al., 1992, Wolf, 1995). This disease can manifest as an effusive peritonitis and/or pleuritis with a short course ending in death; or it may present as a more insidious disease with granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs that also progresses to death (Pedersen, 1987, Hoskins, 1993, Pedersen, 1995). The etiologic agent of FIP is feline coronavirus (FCoV). In environments where large numbers of cats are housed closely together, 75\u2013100% of the animals may be seropositive to the virus (Pedersen, 1995). Despite these numbers, FIP occurs sporadically \u2014 fatal disease is an uncommon manifestation of infection with FCoV. Virus factors are important to disease development, as virus strains vary in virulence (Pedersen, 1987). Virulent FCoV is theorized to arise from mutation of the infecting FCoV during replication in the intestinal tract of infected cats (Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998). The 7b open reading frame (ORF), the 3\u2032-most gene, has been speculated to have a role in virulence, as deletions in this region lead to decreased virulence (Vennema et al., 1992, Herrewegh et al., 1995, Vennema et al., 1998). Despite this data, the specific virus and host factors involved in the production of lethal disease are not known.",

This may be due to a quantitative difference in the amount of each virus variant in each cat tested. Both variants were circulating as every cat tested was infected with one of the virus variants. Some infected with the intact 7a/7b ORF variant were ill and some infected with the deletion mutant were ill. However, as both variants were circulating and thus, every cat was exposed to both variants, there may be a causal relationship between the mutation that occurred and the increased incidence of disease seen in this population. The variation in disease may be related to host factors, such as generation of an effective immune response, rather than solely to the virus itself. Alternatively, mutations in other genomic regions may be responsible for the variation in virulence observed with these isolates.",

In this investigation, all of the FIP victims were genetically related through the sire. Those related to him through both the queen and sire had the highest morbidity while those related to him through the queen or sire only had lower morbidity. This would support the belief that susceptibility to FIP following infection with FCoV has a host genetic component.",
