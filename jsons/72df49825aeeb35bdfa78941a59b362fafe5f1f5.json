In times of crisis, online public information search, via means such as Google searches, offers a window into the most urgent concerns of, and demands by society. By extension, such data offers a window into upcoming, and currently pressing demands on businesses, policymakers and researchers.",

Whilst frontline healthcare workers, government bodies and health researchers work in overdrive to solve this challenge, central (i.e. public health) and ancillary (e.g. social and economic) threats to society are revealed as the crisis unfolds. Policymakers and researchers thus cannot afford to lose sight of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on all aspects of societies and economies, nor on other grand challenges facing humanity.",

This is visualized in Figure 3 . Nodes are sized according to degree centrality. For future research, data collection can be easily extended to accommodate lower search volume locations (as this research note includes only high-volume locations), and to include other languages (NB: \"coronavirus\" is a popular keyword at present reflecting the use of this spelling in the English language as well as many of the Latin script languages). The deliberate summarizing in this research note notwithstanding, we hope that interest in online public information search data is further spurred at this time.",
