According to a report of the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths as of 29 February 2020, of which approximately 92.9% of cases and 97.1% of deaths have been in China [1]. Among these 57 countries/territories, cases reported in 20 countries/territories were attributed to local transmission of COVID-19, whilst those in 37 countries/regions were imported cases. However, the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 varied in different countries//territories. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India (Table 1\n).",

However, implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures helped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in more than 2000 passengers and lowered the R0 to 1.78 [6].

To manage this challenge, infection control measures including prohibiting travel from China, controlling the distribution of face masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and a once-daily press conference by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan (Fig. 3\nA). Under these interventions, Taiwan has a total of 39 cases with a DCI of 1 case per day, which was much lower than that of the nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan (Fig. 3B). Among the 39 patients, 18 acquired the COVID-19 infection outside of Taiwan, of whom 3 were Chinese visitors from China, whilst the other 21 developed the infection in Taiwan (http://nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/SingleDisease.aspx?dc=1&dt=5&disease=19CoV). Four familial cluster transmissions and one nosocomial transmission were reported. To date, 11 patients were discharged (Fig. 3C). Several important actions and responses conducted by the National Health Command Center of Taiwan, including border control, resource re-allocation, case identification (using new data and technology), quarantine of suspicious cases using big data analytics, reassurance and education of the public, mask control and hand hygiene, and formulation of policies toward schools and childcare, have so far successfully alleviated the crisis and contained the epidemic in Taiwan [7].",

            "text": "Based on the earlier experience in China, Ji et al. found a significant correlation between mortality and healthcare resource availability (r = 0.61) [8]. We wonder whether the association between mortality and healthcare burden can be demonstrated outside of China and whether there are other confounding factors, such as the level of health care. Therefore, we used two indexes to represent the level of healthcare: Health Care Index (HCI) [9] and Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI) [10]. The HCI is based on surveys from visitors of one open website and questions for these surveys are similar to many similar scientific and government surveys [9]. The HAQI uses 32 scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0\u2013100 of personal healthcare access and quality by location over time [10]. First, we found that the mortality rate, incidence and death per 1 000 000 people were correlated with the DCI (Spearman's rank-order correlation, all P < 0.05) (Fig. 4\nA) and this association was more prominent in countries with local transmission (Table 2\n). This finding is consistent with the findings of Ji et al. [8] and suggests that rapidly increasing cases in a short time can result in more cases and even more deaths. Second, the incidence was associated with life expectancy (r = 0.613, P < 0.001). This could be because countries with more older adults were more likely to acquire COVID-19. Finally, the incidence was found to be correlated with both HAQI (r = 0.516, P < 0.001) and HCI (r = 0.345, P < 0.012), but mortality and deaths per 1 000 000 people were not associated with the level of health care (Fig. 4B,C). This finding may be explained by the fact that countries with more advanced healthcare systems have better diagnostic ability to identify more cases. By contrast, no death cases were reported in most countries; thus, no significant correlation could be found. However, further study is warranted to clarify these findings.",

Although China had higher morbidity and mortality rates than other sites, the number of daily new cases has been lower in China than outside of China since 26 February 2020. Seven countries had a DCI of >5 cases per day, but the DCI of the other fifty countries/territories was <4 cases per day. The incidence and mortality rates were correlated with DCI, especially in countries with local transmission. Overall, this preliminary report shows us the initial epidemiological findings of COVID-19, but continuous monitoring of patients with this disease is still warranted.",
