            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a serious and increasing threat to human health and welfare (Daszak et al., 2000; King et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008). Diseases that have recently emerged in humans include SARS, HIV, and swine flu. It is projected that 39.5 million people are currently infected with HIV/AIDS (WHO, 2006), and in 2007 alone, it was estimated that 18 billion dollars would be needed to prevent future HIV transmission and provide care for those already infected (WHO, 2007). In wildlife populations, EIDs also have resulted in recent and dramatic declines in mammals (e.g., Ebola in African apes; Walsh et al., 2003, canine distemper virus in wild dogs and lions; Roelke-Parker et al., 1996), amphibians (e.g., Chytridiomycosis fungus in global amphibian populations; Daszak et al., 1999), insects (e.g., the mite Varroa jacobsoni in honey bees; Oldroyd, 1999), and birds (e.g., conjunctivitis due to Mycoplasma gallisepticum in passerines; Williams et al., 2002). Human EIDs originate from multiple sources (e.g., host shifts from animal reservoirs [zoonotics], evolution of existing organisms, and reemergence due to antimicrobial resistance), are increasing in number, and are globally distributed (Jones et al., 2008). Although there is not sufficient data to evaluate whether there is a similar trend for increasing frequency of disease emergence in wildlife populations, if similar drivers influence the process of disease emergence we might expect this to be the case (Daszak et al., 2000). The ability to predict when, where, and within which species pathogens are most likely to emerge is therefore increasingly urgent. Understanding the process of disease emergence will be critical for developing strategies to minimize risk and reduce the high cost of managing outbreaks once a disease has emerged.",

Ecological drivers that favor emergence are most frequently associated with changes in host or pathogen ecology, specifically (1) an increase in host population density and contact rates, (2) environmental changes that effect host quality and demography, and (3) changes in host mobility and behavior. Evolutionary drivers of emergence include high genetic variability in the pathogen population (Morand et al., 1996; Gupta et al., 1998) or a lack of variability in the host (Daszak et al., 2000; Altizer et al., 2003b). However, sustainable emergence of a pathogen on a host is only one outcome of a complex multistep process.",

            "text": "Close geographic proximity among hosts likely increases contact rates and, hence, opportunity for shifts (step 1, Fig. 1). Although geographic overlap may be important for determining which pathogens a host species is exposed to, successful infection and then transmission of the pathogen in the new host will depend on evolutionary and ecological factors determined by the biology of both host and pathogen (step 2, Fig. 1). For example, recent comparative analyses have demonstrated that viruses are the most likely group to cross species boundaries (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2005), perhaps facilitated by high mutation rates and fast generation times providing the potential to rapidly overcome barriers to infection (Parrish et al., 2008). In contrast, within primates, half of the recorded helminth pathogens are specific to a single host species (Pedersen et al., 2005). Pathogen taxonomy and, by implication, pathogen biology, may then serve as an indicator of potential for host shifts. However, host characteristics also are important. Close evolutionary relationships among host species might translate into similar immunological responses and life-history traits (Pfennig, 2000; Ricklefs and Fallon, 2002; Perlman and Jaenike, 2003), and hence increase the likelihood of successful cross-species infection. The rate of spread in the new host and the progression through the stages of host shift to sustainable disease emergence will be affected by host and pathogen demographics (step 3, Fig. 1), for example, population density, contact rates, and the rate of spread of the pathogen in the new host (R\n0; number of new cases per infected individual) (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001; Fenton and Pedersen, 2005; Woolhouse et al., 2005). Mathematical models of host-pathogen interactions (e.g., traditional SIR\u2014susceptible, infected and recovered\u2014models) indicate that for diseases transmitted in a density dependent fashion (i.e., by direct contact), pathogens will only persist and become established in populations above a critical threshold density (R\n0 > 1; Anderson and May, 1992). Disease emergence may be inhibited at any stage, providing the opportunity for alternative management strategies; unfortunately, this complexity contributes to the difficulty in generating accurate predictive models.",

We expand on our previous analysis to explore the potential for future pathogen host shifts and disease emergence within and between wild primates and humans. First, we use the relationship between host relatedness, geographic overlap, and pathogen community similarity to quantify the risk of future host shifts that each species faces. Second, we evaluate how past host shifts between primates might have shaped pathogen communities by analyzing patterns of host specificity. Third, we explore whether the phylogenetic risk of host shifts may have shaped host geographic distributions over time. Finally, we identify regions of the globe where we predict host shifts between nonhuman primates and humans may be most frequent. This analysis provides the first quantitative attempt to assess the risk of pathogens host-shifting to humans from wildlife populations, a critical step toward predicting disease emergence.",

Although the relative importance of co-inheritance versus host-shifts in structuring pathogen communities remains unresolved, experimental cross-infection of fungal pathogens among tropical plant species (Gilbert and Webb, 2007) revealed a qualitatively similar relationship between host evolutionary relationships and cross-infection success, to that between host relatedness and pathogen sharing in primates (Davies and Pedersen, 2008). We therefore suggest that, although co-inheritance will be important, the shape of the relationship may be determined by host shifts. Nonetheless, disentangling co-inheritance from host shifts should be a focus of future studies but will require detailed information on pathogen phylogeny for many species.",

We map the product of PRHS to humans (cell weights Cellw2) and an index of human population growth (increase in population density during 10 years) to highlight areas of both high population growth and many closely related primates. Here, cell weights (cellw3) are calculated as:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Cell}}_{\\text{w3}} = {\\text{cell}}_{\\text{w2}} \\cdot \\left( {{ \\ln }\\left[ {{\\text{population}}\\;{\\text{size 2}}000} \\right]-{ \\ln }\\left[ {{\\text{population}}\\;{\\text{size 199}}0} \\right]} \\right). $$\\end{document}Last, we consider minimum threshold population densities required for sustained transmission and successful establishment of a disease after a host shift and map human population centers (cities > 25,000) on the weighted human risk map. Population centers in close proximity to regions with high phylogenetic risk of host shifts and human population growth are likely to be foci of disease emergence.",

Previous work has mapped where diseases have emerged in humans in the past (Jones et al., 2008) and which pathogens likely pose the biggest risk of host shifts to humans (Cleaveland et al., 2001). Our study is the first to make predictions about the likelihood of host shifts in the future. Specifically, we use a robust evolutionary relationship between host relatedness and pathogen sharing to quantify the phylogenetic risk of host shifts within primates. We identify species between which host shifts are likely to be frequent, and map geographic areas in which they are distributed. In addition, we generate a hotspot map to highlight regions where humans may be most at risk of host shifts from wild primates.

However, limited data on disease in natural populations, in particular, historical information on when and where a pathogen first moved between host species, has made it difficult to generate predictive models (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007). In a recent paper, we demonstrated that pathogen community similarity among primate species-pairs was correlated closely with their geographical proximity and phylogenetic relatedness (Davies and Pedersen, 2008). Close geographical proximity provides the opportunity for host\u2013host contact and hence pathogen transfer, whereas phylogenetic distance might be indicative of the ease with which a pathogen can infect a novel host given the opportunity. In this paper, we extrapolate the observed relationship between pathogen sharing and host evolutionary relatedness to explore the likely frequency of host shifts within communities of primate hosts. We predict that host shifts will be most frequent among co-occurring and closely related hosts. Therefore, the frequency of host shifts will reflect both the geographical distribution of host species across the landscape, as well as the shape of the phylogenetic tree that connects them (Fig. 5). For example, the white fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) overlaps in its distribution with many other New World primates and is nested within the recent New World radiation of capuchin monkeys (genus: Cebus). We predict the risk of cross-species pathogen transmission to be high for this species. In contrast, Demidoff\u2019s bushbaby (Galagoides demidoff) is common across central and western Africa, and also overlaps with many other primates in its distribution, but has only few close relatives. We predict intermediate risk of cross-species pathogen transmission for this species. The lowest risk of cross-species pathogen transmission is predicted for evolutionary distinct species in regions of low primate diversity (Fig. 5).\n",

            "text": "Our model assumes that primate hosts will differ in their vulnerability to host shifts. We predict that frequent host shifts will increase pathogen species richness and decrease the proportion of host-specific pathogens per host, as pathogens are shared with an increasing fraction of the host community. However, evaluating pathogen species richness is confounded by sampling artifacts (Altizer and Pedersen, 2008; but see Nunn et al., 2003; Lindenfors et al., 2007), which may vary both taxonomically and geographically (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007). We therefore focus on variation in host specificity. Although it is possible that a systematic geographic bias in the distribution of pathogen species richness (e.g., as suggested for protozoan parasites; Nunn et al., 2005) might additionally influence the frequency of host shifts, we do not believe that this trend would be sufficient to affect the strong geographical patterns found here. The results strongly support our hypothesis: primates with many close phylogenetic relatives and geographical neighbors have significantly fewer host-specific pathogens. This relationship becomes stronger when we exclude viral pathogens, which tend to be less constrained by taxonomic barriers (Pedersen et al., 2005; Davies and Pedersen, 2008). To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore variation in host specificity among within-host pathogen communities across an entire mammalian order. In addition, we suggest that future studies investigating correlates of pathogen species richness should consider the frequency of host shifts.",

These findings are important because current estimates indicate that almost 49% of primates are considered threatened (IUCN, 2008), and infectious diseases, especially those that have resulted from a host shift, have been recognized recently as a significant driver of extinction risk in wild animals (Pedersen et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2006, 2009). Primates suffer from multiple threats, including habitat fragmentation and transformation, and direct exploitation (IUCN, 2008), which may increase susceptibility to disease-mediated declines (Smith et al., 2009). Direct exploitation through hunting for bushmeat, necessitating frequent contact between humans and wild primates, is already associated with emerging infectious diseases moving to humans (i.e., SIV, Ebola, STLV-1; Wolfe et al., 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2006). More recently, there has been increasing awareness of the risk for diseases moving from humans to wildlife populations. In Tai National Park, Ivory Coast endangered chimpanzee populations have suffered dramatic declines from pathogens shared with humans, including three outbreaks from pandemic human viruses (human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumoniovirus (hMPV); K\u00f6ngden et al., 2008). Significant declines in both chimpanzee and gorilla populations also have been documented across central Africa due to infectious diseases (Leroy et al., 2004). Ominously, it is likely that current risk scenarios are underestimates, based on limited pathogen sampling, especially in wild primates (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007).",

            "text": "Geographic regions with high primate species richness, particularly, high Hominidae diversity, such as west Africa, pose a disproportionate risk of host shifts from wild primates to humans. Notably, Amazonia is not a hotspot for risks of shifts to humans, despite high primate diversity. New World monkeys diverged from Old World monkeys and apes ~ 40MYA, hence represent only distant evolutionary relatives to humans. Although our model indicates host shifts from wild primates to humans to be most frequent within central and west Africa, the likelihood of a host shift will be affected by additional factors influencing host\u2013host contact rates. Predicting successful host shifts will therefore require information on these additional factors. In this study, we used the rate at which humans are transforming natural habitat, indexed by human population growth, as a proxy for encounter rates between wildlife species and their associated pathogens. As human populations grow, encroach into new areas, and transform habitats, we may be at greater risk of contacting new pathogens (Daszak et al., 2000; Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001; Weiss and McMichael, 2004; Wolfe et al., 2005). This is of particular concern, given the positive correlation between human population growth and our modeled risk of host shifts (Spearman\u2019s R = 0.328, P = 0.049, adjusting degrees of freedom to account for spatial autocorrelation), suggesting that in many parts of central Africa, where host shifts are predicted to be frequent, human population growth also is high.",

            "text": "Global emergence of human infectious diseases frequently originate not from the point of first infection but from human population centers, where contact rates among individuals are high and where international travel and dissemination of the pathogen to other cities is facilitated (Woolhouse, 2002; Tatem et al., 2006; Sharp and Hahn, 2008). In epidemiological models, directly transmitted pathogens are not likely to persist in populations below a critical size threshold (a function of both host and pathogen characteristics; Anderson and May, 1992). For example, measles is thought to go locally extinct in populations comprising less than 250,000 individuals (Keeling and Grenfell, 1997). Many host shift events may therefore never become established. However, large population centers in or near areas of rapid human expansion can provide the demographic component necessary to convert a host shift into a global emergence event. Here, we map the distribution of the major human population centers across the globe. Population centers that have the potential to facilitate the emergence of new diseases shifting from wild primates to humans are those in west and east Central Africa, including: Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; Brazzaville, Congo; and Yaounde, Cameroon to the west, and Kampala, Uganda; Kigali, Rwanda; and Nairobi, Kenya to the east. Infectious disease detection and control, before emergence events, should focus on these regions.",

            "text": "Possibly the worlds most devastating pandemic, HIV-1, provides a remarkable case study, closely matching our model predictions. Resulting from a host shift from chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives (Korber et al., 2000), HIV-1, was first described in 1981, but was introduced to human populations several times during the past 100 years\u2014two of which were from SIVcpzPtt (simian immunodeficiency virus) of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) from west central Africa (Korber et al., 2000). One shift led to the global AIDS pandemic (HIV-1 group M), and the other resulted in a localized endemic in Cameroon (HIV-1 group N) (Keele et al., 2006). Although SIV has been found in more than 30 African primate species, chimpanzees are the only species that harbor the strain most closely linked to pandemic HIV-1 (Sharp and Hahn, 2008; Keele et al., 2006). Recent analysis of HIV-1 group M suggests that several variants were circulating in the 1960s, and molecular analysis now proposes that HIV-1 likely emerged from SIVcpzPtt at the turn of the 20th century (1902\u20131921) but had a period of relatively slow growth during the next 50 years (Worobey et al., 2008). It is thought that HIV-1 group M was first transmitted to humans from wild chimpanzees in the southwest corner of Cameroon (Keele et al., 2006), and its establishment and spread was likely facilitated by the rise of cities, specifically Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Leopoldville, Zaire). In 1910, no population centers in the area of the cross-species transmission event were greater than 10,000 people; however, Kinshasa grew rapidly as a trading center and had a population between 100,000\u2013400,000 during the middle of the twentieth century when HIV-1 can be found in human samples (Sharp and Hahn, 2008; Worobey et al., 2008). Kinshasa is 700 km from the location of the original host shift event; however, it was a key transportation hub through river travel (Sharp and Hahn, 2008). The successful emergence of HIV occurred in our predicted hot spot areas of high human risk. This example highlights the complex multistage process that drives disease emergence: a region with high risk of shifts to humans; a host shift from our closest relative; delayed emergence after the local growth of the human population at a transportation center.",

Many pathogens from humans have been found in wild primate populations (e.g., polio, syphilis, influenza A, and measles) and pose a significant threat to their persistence (Nunn and Altizer, 2006). Almost half of wild primates face the risk of extinction (IUCN, 2008) and pathogens have been linked to substantial population declines (Formenty et al., 1999, Leroy et al., 2004, K\u00f6ngden et al., 2008); understanding the patterns driving cross-species transmission and host shifts in wild populations will therefore be crucial for their conservation. Within wildlife populations, ecological factors may be more important in determining rates of cross-species transmission and host shifts within wild primates. Host life history, ecological niche, feeding and activity patterns, sexual behavior, group size, and territoriality are strong determinants of pathogen transmission rates within a host population (Altizer et al., 2003a; Nunn and Altizer, 2006), and therefore may be important for determining when and to whom cross-species transmission events are likely to be successful. Although a comprehensive exploration of these ecological factors is beyond our current scope, knowledge of how host ecology is likely to interact with pathogen ecology, host phylogeny, and geography will be key for developing a predictive framework of wildlife disease emergence.",

Nonetheless, we suspect that our results, specifically that phylogenetic tree shape and geographic dispersion are likely to affect the phylogenetic risk of a host shift, will likely extrapolate across taxa (see Gilbert and Webb, 2007). Last, we note that the relationship between pathogen taxonomy, host phylogeny, and host geography may be complex and vary across the different pathogen groups.
