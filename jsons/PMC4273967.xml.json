Evidence of viral infection was detected in 22% of CAP in adults [7]. Moreover, viruses were frequently found in the airways of patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICU) with pneumonia, and patients with viral and bacterial infections had comparable mortality rates [7]\u2013[11].",

But, the Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials of antiviral agents does not demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of influenza [18]. However, the original studies included in the Cochrane review did not include people with severe underlying disorders or patients with a severe presentation of influenza. For this reason, no conclusion can be made on the efficacy of antiviral treatment for viral pneumonia by the Cochrane review [19]. There is evidence of efficacy in the treatment of influenza pneumonia [20]\u2013[22], and early empirical antiviral therapy is still recommended in critically ill patients in whom viral pneumonia is suspected [7].",

Moreover, evaluations of the diagnostic value of any clinical parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, have not been performed. Although PCR methods are sensitive and real-time PCR enables rapid results in a clinically relevant time period, use of PCR is sometimes limited in CAP patients due to the associated costs [27].

Previous studies did not evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the radiology findings for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP, in terms of which parameters were of help in the clinical decision to commence antiviral treatment. In our study, GGO was not sufficiently sensitive to detect viral pneumonia (indicating that other radiology findings are also commonly present in viral pneumonia) but was highly specific for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. In our study, an AUC of 0.672 may not be sufficient for a clinical decision. However, there are no other clinical parameters that are preferable or useful for making decisions concerning empirical antiviral agents in clinical practice, although such parameters are badly needed. In our study, 73 patients had rhinorrhea or GGO, but only 10 (14%) of those patients were treated with antiviral drugs empirically, while 25 (40%) of the remaining 63 patients with rhinorrhea or GGO were diagnosed with viral pneumonia and were not treated with empirical antiviral agents.",

            "text": "This study had several limitations. First, the etiologic microorganism was heterogeneous and not identified in 50% of patients with non-viral CAP. For this reason, Influenza pneumonia was compared, additionally, with only pneumococcal pneumonia which mostly accounts for CAP and similar results. Second, although this study was undertaken at two hospitals, they were referral centers, not primary health-care clinics. There is the possibility that patients with less severe CAP could have been included if data from a primary healthcare clinic had been available. Third, because of the retrospective study design, 28% of the CAP patients were not tested using the respiratory virus PCR test and were excluded from the study, although the medical doctors were educated and were in consensus regarding the routine prescription of the respiratory virus PCR for correct etiologic diagnosis of CAP patients at our hospital. Because the factors influencing the physicians' decision to prescribe respiratory virus PCR were not determined, they may have influenced our results as unmeasured confounding factors in the analysis. Fourth, we did not perform bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia because its diagnostic role in viral pneumonia is still not well defined and review articles still recommend upper respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia [7], [10], [32]. Fifth, serum procalcitonin levels, which indicate the acute phase of bacterial CAP, were not reviewed and analyzed in this study, because procalcitonin was not checked routinely in all patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the usefulness of novel biomarkers for predicting viral pneumonia in CAP, including procalcitonin. Sixth, there is a possibility of co-infection in patients with a positive viral PCR and no positive bacteriology because of the limited sensitivity of current diagnostic methods.",
