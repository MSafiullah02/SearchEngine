In this study, we combine genetic and epidemiological data to investigate the genetic diversity, evolution, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province. We generated virus genome sequences from 53 patients in Guangdong using both metagenomic sequencing and multiplex PCR amplification followed by nanopore sequencing. Through phylogenetic analysis, interpreted in the context of available epidemiological information, we sought to investigate the timing and relative contributions of imported cases versus local transmission, the nature of genetically distinct transmission chains within Guangdong, and how the emergency response in Guangdong was reflected in the reduction and elimination of these transmission chains. Our results may provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of COVID-19 in other regions.",

More intensive surveillance was initiated on 30 th January 2020 in response to the Spring Festival period, which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in China (Kraemer et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020) and because asymptomatic COVID-19 cases had been reported (Guan et al., 2020) . This included monitoring (1) all travelers returning from Hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity, (2) their close contacts, and (3) all hospitalized patients in clinics, including those without fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Approximately 1.35 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30 th January and 15 th March 2020. Surveillance commenced at Guangdong airports in early March, following the growth of COVID-19 outbreaks outside of China. In total,~1.6 million tests were performed by 19 th March 2020, identifying 1,388 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in Guangdong Province ( Figure 1B) . Around a quarter of cases (336) were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds (1,014) had a likely exposure history in Hubei (see STAR Methods). For locally infected cases, 181 (53%) were linked to transmission among household members. More than half of the reported cases (60%) were from the cities of Shenzhen ll and Guangzhou ( Figure 1B ). We note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true number of infections, although the degree of under-reporting is unknown. Surveillance was targeted toward travelers, hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated cases.",

The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Guangdong (red) are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other Chinese provinces and other countries (gray). This pattern agrees with the epidemiological time series in Figure 1A , indicating that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission. Despite this, there were a number of instances where sequences from Guangdong appeared to cluster together, sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions. To explore these lineages in more detail, we performed a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale. A summary visualization of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in Figure 3B and is largely congruent with the ML tree. The current low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities; we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites ( Figure 3A ). Nevertheless, five clusters (denoted A-E) containing Guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of >80% (i.e., their sequences grouped monophyletically in >80% of trees in the posterior sample; Figure 3B ). These clusters were also observed in the ML phylogeny ( Figure 3A ). Some included only sequences sampled in Guangdong (A, B), others included sequences sampled in other countries and provinces (C, D, E).",

Three clusters (C, D, E) have earlier tMRCAs that coincide with the start of the Guangdong epidemic and two (A, B) have later tMRCAs, around the time of the epidemic peak in the province ( Figure 4 ). The average time between the tMRCA and the earliest ll sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 10.25 days. The observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster (tMRCA to most recently sampled sequence) ranged from 9.49 (cluster B) to 45.2 (cluster D) days. The clusters with earlier tMRCAs contain more sequences from travelers sampled outside of China, possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from Guangdong after January 2020 (Flightradar24, 2020) . The median tMRCA estimate of the COVID-19 pandemic was 1 st December 2019 (95% HPD 15 th November to 13 th December 2019; Figure 4 ), consistent with previous analyses (Rambaut, 2020).",

For example, the largest Guangdong phylogenetic cluster (denoted A in Figures 3 and 4) comprises 8 sequences, none of which are placed at the root of the cluster, and it is tempting to conclude that the entire cluster derived from community transmission within Guangdong. However, 6 of the 8 genomes reported travel from Hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Guangdong, with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from Wuhan ( Figure 4 ).",

The number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small (often one), and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription, PCR amplification, or sequencing. Bayesian estimates of divergence times (Rannala and Yang, 1996) , such as the tMRCA of the pandemic, are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and informed by dense sampling through time, and are thus expected to be more robust. Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location. Therefore, as with all phylogenetic analyses, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information.",

The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for COVID (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence. SNP differences were sometimes observed when the same sample was sequenced using different sequencing approaches.

The resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias.

Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner (r = 0.592) ( Figure S3 ). The Bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken with BEAST v1.10.4 (Ayres et al., 2012; Suchard et al., 2018) , also using the HKY+Q 4 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock, under a noninformative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior (Ferreira and Suchard 2008) . Taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tMRCA of observed phylogenetic clusters A-E (Table S1 .2). Two independent chains were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 states. Upon completion, chains were combined using LogCombiner after removing 10% of states as burn-in and convergence was assessed with Tracer . The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred from the Bayesian posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator, and visualized with figtreejs-react (https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react).
