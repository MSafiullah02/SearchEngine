The fast progress in digital technologies generates a pressure on firms to innovate and transform their businesses. Organizations need to understand how to implement digital technologies and innovative business concepts [3]. Digitalization is very challenging for most organizations who struggle with understanding the opportunities and consequences to their business [4]. The task is especially challenging for small firms due to their general lack of resources [5]. One way to develop the capability to innovate and transform is to cooperate with others [6]. Businesses are increasingly seeking multiple partners to be more successful in applying digital solutions and achieving digitalization [7]. However, instituting and effectively managing a co-creation strategy is challenging, and potentially leading to tensions between companies [8].",

We have therefore looked for arenas where firms co-create, and we conjectured that business clusters would be appropriate arenas. Business clusters have some common elements of cooperation and common activities for the benefit of the cluster companies. We have therefore addressed how co-creation among businesses can contribute to digitalization among the cluster members. We thus raised the following research question: How does co-creation contribute to digitalization in business clusters? To answer this main research question, we raised three more specific research questions: What are the drivers for co-creation in the business clusters? what are the barriers for co-creation in the business clusters? and how does co-creation influence digitalization in the business clusters? By addressing the drivers for co-creation, we would improve our understanding of issues and activities that contributed to the co-creation of digitalization. By addressing the barriers for co-creation, we would get a better understanding of key issues that hampered the co-creation efforts. This would give us a deeper understanding of the how the co-creation activities addressed these issues in order to stimulate co-creation in the clusters.",

Such connections have provided the participants with the capacity to create opportunities for competitive advantage through new sources of information. A rising stream of research has conceptually described these collaborations as co-creation. This research can present substantial input to innovation processes [11]. These networks can enhance competitive power by forming shared sources of value creation through co-creation [12]. This collaboration is especially valuable when the market is dynamic, and the enterprises have limited resources for innovation. Firms collaborating in such networks contribute knowledge and resources in co-creating interpretations and responses. This co-creation relates to an array of corporate issues such as supply chain utilization, service innovations and of information technology implementation [13]. There is a dearth of research on the nature of co-creation in various contexts and how it can be managed [14, 15]. There is a need for more research on issues such as how do companies that are not suppliers or customers to each other, collaborate horizontally in business networks, and how does co-creation as a dynamic process contributes to the value-creation of the enterprises and the whole ecosystem [11].",

Lack of resources, both human and financial, can lead to hesitation among member companies when it comes to participating in innovation [6]. Trust has also been found to have a major impact on collaboration. In a case study by Sarker, Sarker, Sahaym and Bj\u00f8rn-Andersen [16], the authors found that trust, goodwill and commitment are important drivers for member companies to commit resources for generating new products and services. Other findings are issues such as lack of incentives, leadership and a clear common vision. Such issues are important barriers that must be dealt with to create a fertile co-operation environment [6]. There are many potential benefits from co-creating, and substantial benefits can come from sharing knowledge and data [6].",

Nevertheless, it is a difficult balancing act for many companies to share their knowledge without giving up competitive advantage [18]. Furthermore, we find that increased competitiveness, increased usability of collaboration tools (if done correctly) and greater focus on customer data [6, 19] are advantages that can be achieved by co-creation. In SMEs, we see that IT-facilitated collaboration between companies can increase, and it can make members more proactive. It can be a challenging task to get such a collaboration going, but it can lead to improved performance [20]. In companies with few resources and employees, IT-facilitated collaboration systems can be helpful if they cooperate [6, 20], and customer loyalty and retention may increase upon establishment of such co-creation services [17]. We argue that resources are key to realize value form co-creation [21]. We therefore adopted the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm [22, 23] as an analytical lens.",

What is generally common elements is that it is perceived as something novel, and that it is based on digital technology [26, 27]. Osmundsen et al.

All informants in the three cases emphasized this as one of the main drivers for membership. Some companies joined the cluster to get access to new customers or partners, while others saw the cluster as an opportunity to develop new competences and capabilities. Regardless of the corporate intention, the clusters arrange various activities that facilitate networking among the members. We conjecture that such activities were essential to create arenas for co-creation. These activities could be reserved for cluster members, or they could include public institutions outside the cluster as well as members of other clusters.

The companies see clusters as a place to go to meet other companies in an informal setting. Informal arrangements like this have proven to lead to friendship which is important when it comes to building trust [34]. When the members of a cluster increase their trust in each other it can lead to more knowledge sharing. Networking activities create relationships and build trust between companies. This can create an arena for exchanging knowledge and experience among the cluster members. This is consistent with the literature, which points out that knowledge exchange is central in collaboration [6], and a driving force for change [17]. In our literature review, we uncovered two activities related to knowledge sharing that is consistent with our findings [35]:Co-inform: Common to all three clusters is the newsletter that the cluster management sends out to the cluster members by email. The newsletters convey activities and opportunities in the cluster, as well as providing information on ongoing and new projects. They also have websites where, among other things, they present the cluster members.Co-learn: Both Cluster A and Cluster B offer their members access to a test lab where they can access technology that they might not otherwise be able to afford. Such labs are important for companies, regardless of available resources, to test new technological trends and get access to useful knowledge. In this way they may get the ability to identify appropriate technology. Research has demonstrated that testing out new technological trends is important in order to further develop your business processes [33], and that digital technology can have a direct impact on how businesses innovate [1].\n",

Also, several informants from small enterprises noted that the costs of participating in cluster activities was sometimes prohibiting small member companies from participating. This is consistent with the literature, which has demonstrated that limited human and economic resources can be a significant challenge for co-creation [6]. Several informants noted that the projects could last a long time, and this would reduce the interest among the participants.

Most informants noted that it was easy to get access to the cluster management, and that it was easy to propose topics for activities or projects in the clusters. It was generally perceived that it was a short way from proposing a new topic to set up a project through a brainstorming session. This can lead to digital innovation through the co-creation of new products or services [15, 25]. This supports the argument that clusters drive innovation. S\u00f6lvell et al. [33] argue that there are three critical arguments for why innovation tend to be connected with clusters: (1) the need for incremental reduction of technical and economic uncertainty, (2) the need for repeated and continuous interaction between related firms and specialized institutions (including research and education), and (3) The need for face-to-face contact in the exchange and creation of new knowledge. Our findings demonstrated that the three clusters in this study facilitate resolution of all those needs.",
