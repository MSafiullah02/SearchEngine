Symptoms may be atypical in young children and the elderly.6 The most common complication of influenza is pneumonia, which may be a primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes.

Data cleaning and checking for quality of data entry were performed. The demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics were summarized. Further data analysis was conducted by epidemiological week and year against the number of SARI-positive cases over the study period to show the influenza peaks and seasonal variation and the influenza virus types and subtypes. The Moving Epidemic Method application (memapp),13 through the R free software for statistical computing and graphics, was used to assess the quality of data and generate graphs of all seasons included in the study allowing the visual comparison of the magnitudes and timings of all epidemics in the dataset. Additionally, the application was used to calculate and display some estimators as follows: the number of influenza seasons included in the study, the average epidemic start week, the average epidemic length, the epidemic percentage and the epidemic and intensity thresholds (medium, high and very high).\n",

Therefore, it was not possible to calculate the burden of the disease (BoD), which is important for addressing the threat that seasonal influenza may pose, for strengthening the national and global preparedness as well as prevention and control efforts, and for understanding the overall global burden of influenza disease and preparing for influenza pandemics. Second, studying SARI in one sentinel site out of eight sites in Egypt, a country with more than 90 million people, cannot give a holistic picture of the real state of surveillance of this disease in the country.",
