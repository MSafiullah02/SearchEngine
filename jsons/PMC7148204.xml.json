Figure 1 shows an example of such a relevance feedback process, where positive and negative relevance judgments from the user are used to train a classifier, which in turn is used to provide new suggestions to the user, with the process continuing until the user completes the interaction. There has been relatively little work on user relevance feedback and truly scalable and interactive multimedia systems in general in the last decade, however, which recently raised serious concerns in the multimedia community [39]. Clearly, the time has come to re-visit interactive learning with an aim towards scalability.",

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the proposed approach tightly integrates high-dimensional indexing with the interactive learning process. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first scalable interactive learning method to go beyond utilizing clustering in the pre-processing phase only. To evaluate the approach, we propose a new zero-shot inspired evaluation protocol over the ImageNet collection, and use an existing protocol for the large-scale YFCC100M collection. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both suggestion relevance and interactive performance. In particular, our approach requires less than 0.3 s per interaction round to generate suggestions from the YFCC100M collection, using a single CPU core and less than 7 GB of main memory.",

The most popular flavour of interactive learning is user relevance feedback that presents the user, in each interaction round, with the items for which the classification model is most confident [36]. User relevance feedback has frequently been used in the best performing entries of benchmarks focusing on interactive video search and exploration [28, 41]. However, those solutions were designed for collections far smaller than YFCC100M, which is the challenge we take in this paper. Linear models for classification, such as Linear SVM are still amongst the most frequent choices in relevance feedback applications [22, 31, 48] due to their simplicity, interpretability and explainability as well as the ability to produce accurate results with few annotated samples and scale to very large collections.",

One class of methods uses scalar quantization. The NV-tree, for example, is a large-scale index that uses random projections at its core [25, 26], recursively projecting points onto segmented random lines. LSH is another indexing method that uses random projections acting as locality preserving hashing functions [2, 8]. Recently, multimedia researchers have considered hashing for multimedia applications, but typically at a much smaller scale than considered here [13, 29, 42]. LSH has been considered in the context of hyperplane-based nearest-neighbour queries [5, 45] and point-based farthest-neighbour queries [7, 32, 46], but not in the context of hyperplane-based farthest-neighbour queries. We argue that LSH and related methods fail to satisfy the three requirements above: they focus on quality guarantees rather than performance guarantees (R1); hashing creates \u201cslices\u201d in high-dimensional space, making ranking based on distance to a decision boundary difficult (R2); and they typically focus on \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\epsilon $$\\end{document}-range queries, giving no guarantees on the number of results returned (R3).",

Some methods, such as BoW-based methods, only store image identifiers in the clusters, thus failing to support R3, while others store the entire features, allowing to rank the results from the farthest clusters. Finally, many clustering methods seek to match well the distribution of data in the high-dimensional space.

One of the main aims of PQ is data compression, however, and PQ-based methods essentially transform the Euclidean space, complicating the identification of furthest neighbours (R2). PQ-compression was compared directly with the Blackthorn compression method designed for interactive learning [48] and was shown as having inferior performance. The extended Cluster Pruning (eCP) algorithm [11, 12], however, is an example of a vector quantifier which attempts to balance cluster sizes for improved performance, thus aiming to satisfy all three requirements; we conclude that eCP is our prime candidate.",

For each collection, cluster representatives are selected randomly and clusters are formed by assigning images to the nearest cluster based on Euclidean distance, computed efficiently directly in compressed space. The indexing algorithm recursively selects 1% of the images at each level as representatives for the level above, until fewer than 100 representatives remain to form the root of the index. As an example, the bottom level of the index for each modality in the YFCC100M collection consists of 992, 066 clusters, organized in a 3 level deep index hierarchy, which gives on average 100 images per cluster and per internal node. When building the indices, the average cluster size was chosen to be small, as previous studies show that searching more small clusters yields better results than searching fewer large clusters [11, 40].",

The figure clearly demonstrates that Exquisitor is the best approach in both precision and response time compared to all the baseline approaches, achieving better precision than Blackthorn, requiring less than 0.3 s compared to Blackthorn\u2019s 1.2 s. Both k-NN-bases approaches get stuck at 6% which is to be expected since the k-NN query narrows down the scope of the search making it impossible to get out of local optima. SVM+LSH performs better, with precision nearly as good as Blackthorn and response time close to Exquisitor. Overall, however, Exquisitor performs better partly due to being able to utilize the SVM during cluster selection with k-FN queries, and partly due to the cluster segments allowing better multi-modal results.",

Exquisitor combines state-of-the-art large-scale interactive learning with a new cluster-based retrieval mechanism, enhancing the relevance capabilities of interactive learning by exploiting the inherent structure of the data. Through experiments conducted on YFCC100M, the largest publicly available multimedia collection, Exquisitor achieves higher precision and lower latency, with less computational resources. Additionally, through a modified zero-shot learning experiment on ImageNet, we determine the Exquisitor approach to be excellent at solving cumbersome classification tasks. Exquisitor also introduces customizability that is, to the best of our knowledge, previously unseen in large-scale interactive learning by: (i) allowing a tradeoff between low latency (few clusters) and high quality (many clusters); and (ii) combatting data skew by omitting huge (and thus likely nondescript) clusters from consideration. Exquisitor has recently been used successfully in interactive media retrieval competitions such as the Lifelog Search Challenge [21] and Video Browser Showdown [19]. In conclusion, Exquisitor provides excellent performance on very large collections while being efficient enough to bring large-scale multimedia analytics to standard desktops and laptops, and even high-end mobile devices.",
