This can be appreciated by illuminating the eye from the side and looking for irregularity on the corneal surface, followed by fluorescein staining to rule out corneal ulceration. Conjunctivitis has also been reported in association with systemic disease. Most notably, canine distemper presents with ocular signs early in the course of the disease.6 Canine distemper in the early catarrhal phase is characterized by conjunctivitis, anorexia, fever, and nasal discharge.7 Ferrets with canine distemper will progress to a pruritic rash followed by hyperkeratosis of the footpads.8 The disease has poor prognosis and early identification is helpful for patient isolation and client communication (Fig. 3\n).7\n",

Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the bacteria with cytologic evaluation of conjunctival swabs or histopathologic evaluation of conjunctival biopsies.13\n",

After identification of a corneal ulcer, care should be taken to ensure the eye is not exophthalmic given that exposure keratitis secondary to an orbital mass effect has been reported.18 Treatment of superficial corneal ulceration includes topical, broad-spectrum, antimicrobial agents. If the cornea appears infiltrated or has a hazy yellow or malacic appearance, cytologic evaluation and/or culture is indicated. Perforated eyes warrant systemic antimicrobial therapy in addition to topical antimicrobial therapy. A ruptured ulcer has a characteristic protrusion of fibrin or iris or both (Fig. 7\n). Healed ulcers may leave focal corneal scars that present as localized gray or white opacities. Additionally, the ferret cornea can pigment in a patient with pigmentary keratitis of unknown cause (Fig. 8\n).",
