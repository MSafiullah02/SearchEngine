While members of this group are small in number, they cause characteristic necrosis, both local and systemic, which is often associated with severe dwarfing, a frequent cause of serious reductions in crop yields. The number of Dianthovirus species may increase as the molecular genetic characterization of suspected viruses\u2019 advances. The viral particles are stable and abundant in reproduction, and are therefore suitable for experimental studies in many aspects.",

This bipartite nature of the genome is unique among the viruses of the family Tombusviridae, the genomes of which are usually monopartite. RNA1 (3.9 kb) encodes the RNA replicase components, an auxiliary 27-kDa protein (p27), and an N-terminally overlapping 88-kDa protein (p88) (Xiong et al., 1993, Xiong and Lommel, 1989) that contains RdRP motif (Koonin & Dolja, 1993). RNA1 also encodes a coat protein (CP), which is translated from subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (Sit et al., 1998, Tatsuta et al., 2005, Zavriev et al., 1996). RNA1 can replicate in a single cell in the absence of RNA2 (Osman and Buck, 1987, Paje-Manalo and Lommel, 1989, Pappu and Hiruki, 1988). RNA2 encodes a 35-kDa movement protein (MP), which is essential for the cell-to-cell and systemic movement in plants (Osman and Buck, 1987, Xiong et al., 1993). In addition to the genomic RNAs, a small noncoding RNA (0.4 kb) that consists of nearly the entire region of the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of RNA1 accumulates in dianthovirus-infected plants and protoplasts (Iwakawa et al., 2008; H. Nagano, K. Omote, & T. Okuno, unpublished data). The genomic organization of RCNMV, several RNA elements of which are described in this review, is shown in Fig. 2.1\n.",

The element designated \u201c3\u2032TE-DR1\u201d is predicted to have five stem-loop (SL) structures (Mizumoto et al., 2003, Sarawaneeyaruk et al., 2009), and this overall structure has been confirmed by structure probing (Wang, Kraft, Hui, & Miller, 2010; Y.

The RNA1 5\u2032-UTR contributes to RNA stability in BY-2 protoplasts. A compensatory mutagenesis analysis used to identify possible interactions between the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs of RNA1 in BY-2 protoplasts suggested that no long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction is essential for 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 communication during 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation (Sarawaneeyaruk et al., 2009; S.

The cap-independent translational activities of R2\u2013UTR\u2013Luc and RNA2\u2013Luc are less than 1% of 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation. Instead, RNA2\u2013Luc, which can replicate in the presence of RCNMV replicase proteins, functions as an efficient mRNA when replicated (Mizumoto et al., 2006). This suggests a strong link between the cap-independent translation of RNA2 and RNA replication and a difference in the translational mechanisms of RNA1 and RNA2. Host factors associated with the viral RNA replication process might facilitate the translation of RNA2. Alternatively, RNA2 may have a silencer element(s) that suppresses the translation of RNA2. The low translational activity of RNA2 may be comprehensible, if MP is only required in the late stage of replication to move the virus to neighboring cells. The difference in the translation strategy of RNA1 and RNA2 may be important for the temporal, spatial, and quantitative regulation of RCNMV gene expression during infection.",

The cis-acting RNA elements required for \u2212 1PRF have been mapped to a shifty heptanucleotide sequence GGAUUUU at the slippage site (Kim & Lommel, 1994) and a highly-structured bulged SL structure predicted just downstream from the slippage site in RNA1 (Kim & Lommel, 1998). In addition to these elements, a third cis-acting RNA element that facilitates \u2212 1PRF was identified using an in vitro translation/replication system (Tajima, Iwakawa, Kaido, Mise, & Okuno, 2011). This third RNA element is a small stable SL structure predicted between ARS and 3\u2032TE-DR1 in the 3\u2032-UTR of RNA1. The loop sequence of this element can base pair with the bulge of the SL adjacent to the shifty site. Such long-distance base pairing is possible in all dianthoviruses. Disruption and restoration mutagenesis analyses have demonstrated the importance of long-distance base pairing for efficient \u2212 1PRF in RCNMV RNA1 (Tajima et al., 2011).

RCNMV-Can does not replicate in protoplasts at temperatures higher than 22 \u00b0C, indicating that replication processes are involved in the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity of RCNMV is attributable to at least the 3\u2032 terminal SL of RNA1, because a single-nucleotide substitution from U to C, which changes a U\u2013G wobble pair to a stable C\u2013G pair in the stem of the 3\u2032 terminal SL in RNA1-Can allows the RNA to replicate and to support RNA2 accumulation at nonpermissive temperatures (Mizumoto et al., 2002). The lack of temperature sensitivity in RNA synthesis activity in the crude membrane-bound cellular fraction prepared from RCNMV-Can-infected plants or protoplasts suggests that the promoter elements are distorted in the initiation of minus-strand synthesis at the nonpermissive temperatures (K.

The entire Y-shaped structure (84 nucleotides), including the two small SLs, is important for the negative-strand RNA synthesis of RNA2 (An et al., 2010). YRE is the only RNA element of RCNMV that interacted with p27 supplied in trans, when assessed with the RNA-aptamer (Strepto-Tag) affinity and immunoprecipitation assay in BYL (Iwakawa et al., 2011). YRE also interacts with the 480-kDa replicase complex via p27 (Iwakawa et al., 2011). The 480-kDa replicase complex contains p88 and host proteins, and is thought to be a key player in RCNMV RNA replication (Mine, Takeda, et al., 2010) (see 4.7, 4.8). The interaction between YRE and p27 is required for the recruitment of RNA2 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Hyodo et al., 2011), which is the site of RCNMV RNA replication (Hyodo et al., 2013, Turner et al., 2004).",

Interestingly, however, a protein-mediated coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that both p27 and p88 can interact with their translating template RNA1, which are associated with ribosomes. The interaction between p27 or p88 and its translation templates is abolished or compromised, respectively, by puromycin treatment, which induces the dissociation of polyribosomes from mRNA (Blobel and Sabatini, 1971, Lehninger et al., 1993). These results imply that p27 binds to the template RNA1 via a polyribosome-dependent and puromycin-sensitive mechanism, whereas p88 mainly binds to the template RNA in a translation-coupled, polyribosome-independent, and puromycin-tolerant manner. The interaction mechanism unique to p88 is maintained after the dissociation of the polyribosomes. p88 seems to bind specifically to the 3\u2032-UTR of RNA1 in this translation-coupled mechanism, because SR1f, a degradation product of the 3\u2032-UTR of RNA1 (see Section 4.11), is coimmunoprecipitated with p88 but not with p27. The translation-coupled binding of p88 may partly explain the strong cis-preferential requirement for p88 in the replication of RNA1 (Okamoto et al., 2008).",

A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay using confocal microscopy showed that p27, but not p88, interacts directly with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 within the p27-induced large aggregated structures on the ER in the perinuclear region. Gene silencing and the pharmacological inhibition of Hsp70 and Hsp90 compromised RCNMV RNA replication in plant cells. The inhibition of p27\u2013Hsp70 interaction by 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (a specific inhibitor of Hsp70) inhibited the formation of the 480-kDa complex, but instead induced the formation of nonfunctional large complexes (~ 1024 kDa) in BYL. Hsp70 appears to control the proper assembly of the viral replicase complexes by preventing the aggregation of p27. Alternatively, the large complexes of p27 could be intermediates in the assembly of the RCNMV replicase complex, and Hsp70 might assist the assembly of these complexes into functional replicase complexes. In contrast, the inhibition of p27\u2013Hsp90 interaction by geldanamycin (a specific inhibitor of Hsp90) inhibited the formation of the 480-kDa complex without inducing large complexes, and rendered p27 incapable of binding to a specific viral RNA element (YRE), which is a critical step in the assembly of the 480-kDa replicase complex. These findings suggest that Hsp70 and Hsp90 play essential roles in the assembly of the 480-kDa replicase complex mainly by regulating protein\u2013protein interactions and protein\u2013RNA interactions, respectively. Thus, Hsp70 and Hsp90 regulate different steps in the assembly of the RCNMV replicase complex.",

The domains and critical amino acids in p27 required for its association with and targeting of ER membranes were determined using a C-terminally GFP-fused p27 (p27\u2013GFP), which supported viral RNA replication in the presence of p88. Membrane-flotation assays combined with microscopic observation revealed that the membrane association of p27 is mediated by a stretch of 20 amino acids located in its N-terminal region (amino acids 31\u201350) (Kusumanegara et al., 2012). These 20 amino acids are predicted to form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix, with one side having a cluster of hydrophilic, polar residues and the other side hydrophobic, nonpolar residues, and were sufficient to target the nonviral GFP to ER membranes. Mutations that impede the membrane association of p27 compromise the formation of the RCNMV RNA replication complexes and negative-strand RNA synthesis (Kusumanegara et al., 2012).",

Inhibition of Arf1 activity by BFA disrupted p27-mediated ER remodeling and the assembly of the 480-kDa viral replication complex. Thus, p27 interacts with Arf1, and recruits and relocalizes this protein to the aggregate structures on the ER membranes, where they colocalize (Hyodo et al., 2013).",

A 58 nucleotide sequence in the 5\u2032 proximal region of the 3\u2032-UTR of RNA1 is necessary and sufficient to protect against 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 decay (Iwakawa et al., 2008). SR1f efficiently suppresses both cap-independent and cap-dependent translation, both in vitro and in vivo. SR1f trans-inhibits the negative-strand RNA synthesis of RCNMV genomic RNAs via the repression of replicase protein production, but not via competition with the replicase proteins in vitro (Iwakawa et al., 2008). SR1f seems to play important roles in virus infection and survival, although its precise roles in RCNMV infection in nature remain to be resolved.",

The ER-localization of RCNMV MP:GFP was associated with the replication of RNA1, but not with that of RNA2 or the viral replicase component proteins (p27 and p88) per se (Kaido et al., 2009). This characteristic of MP:GFP is dependent on the 70 amino acids in the C-terminal region of MP and is required for the efficient cell-to-cell movement of the recombinant virus (Kaido, Funatsu, Tsuno, Mise, & Okuno, 2011). Interestingly, the deletion of the C-terminal 70 amino acids of MP had no deleterious effects on its localization to the cell wall, or its ability to increase the PD SEL, to bind to single-stranded RNA, or to interact with MP in vivo (Kaido et al., 2011). These findings show that the recruitment of MP to the viral replication complexes is required for viral cell-to-cell movement. The mechanism that targets RCNMV MP:GFP to the ER, dependent on the replication of RNA1, which does not encode MP, may reflect a strategy to retain MP close to RNA1, thereby achieving its intracellular movement, followed by the intercellular movement of the viral genome.",

Analysis of the RCNMV virions with heat treatment and UV cross-linking suggested that RCNMV is composed of two virion populations (Basnayake et al., 2006): one type contains RNA1 and RNA2, and the other type contains multiple copies (possibly four copies) of RNA2. The origin of assembly sequence (OAS) was identified in RNA2 using the TBSV-vector-based expression of RCNMV CP (Basnayake, Sit, & Lommel, 2009). RNA1 is copackaged with RNA2 via an OAS\u2013RNA1 interaction. Interestingly, the OAS is the TA that is required for the transcription of CPsgRNA from RNA1 via an RNA\u2013RNA interaction (Sit et al., 1998). The N-terminal lysine-rich motif of CP is involved in the formation of the virions in N. benthamiana (Park et al., 2012). The heterologous combinations of RNA1 and RNA2 between RCNMV and SCNMV were infectious and produced progeny virions in their host plants (Chen et al., 1984, Okuno et al., 1983). A mixture of RNA1 from CRSV and RNA2 from RCNMV was also infectious and produced progeny virions in the host plants (Callaway, Giesman-Cookmeyer, Gillock, Sit, & Lommel, 2001). However, unilateral compatibility of RNA1 and RNA2 was reported using the different strains of RCNMV (Rao & Hiruki, 1987).",

            "text": "RCNMV has at least two strategies for suppressing RNA silencing. One strategy requires p27, p88, and viral RNAs (Takeda et al., 2005). In a sense-transgene-mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing (S-PTGS) assay involving the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of viral components and GFP in a GFP-expressing transgenic plant, the RNA-silencing-suppression activity of RCNMV was linked to the ability of viral factors to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis (Takeda et al., 2005), and correlated with the formation of the 480-kDa replicase complex (Mine, Hyodo, et al., 2010). A close relationship between negative-strand RNA synthesis and the suppression of RNA silencing implies a possible scenario, in which RCNMV sequesters the host factors required for RNA silencing and reduces the antiviral silencing response. RCNMV replication also inhibits microRNA biogenesis, in which DCL1 plays an essential role, and dcl1 mutant plants show reduced susceptibility to RCNMV infection (Takeda et al., 2005). Therefore, it has been suggested that DCL1 or its homologues are recruited by the viral RNA replication complex (Takeda et al., 2005). Alternatively, the reduced susceptibility of a dcl1 mutant to RCNMV infection can also be explained by the observations that the disruption of the DCL1 function leads to the higher expression of DCL4 and DCL3 in Arabidopsis leaves (Qu, Ye, & Morris, 2008) and that the destabilization of the miRNA pathway, including the disruption of DCL1, leads to the increased accumulation of AGO1 and positively influences S-PTGS (Martinez de Alba, Jauvion, Mallory, Bouteiller, & Vaucheret, 2011). Given that RCNMV infection inhibits miRNA biogenesis, reduced accumulations of miRNAs, including miR168 that is a regulator of AGO1 mRNA, could increase the accumulation levels of AGO1, which is the core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex.",

The TCV CP is a VSR (Qu, Ren, & Morris, 2003), and TCV requires CP for its cell-to-cell movement in N. benthamiana (Cohen, Gisel, & Zambryski, 2000). TCV-sGFP moved from cell to cell in leaves infiltrated with Agrobacterium expressing RCNMV MP, but did not in leaves infiltrated with Agrobacterium expressing RCNMV p27, p88, and CP (Powers, Sit, Heinsohn, et al., 2008). The functional domains in RCNMV MP required for RNA silencing (Powers, Sit, Heinsohn, et al., 2008) differ from those required for the cell-to-cell movement of the virus and SEL modification (Fujiwara et al., 1993, Tremblay et al., 2005).

However, significantly high degrees of SCNMV occurrence and release of the virus particles from pollen grains were detected serologically (Hiruki et al., 1989). Moreover, in systematic field surveys over many years, high-specific incidences of SCNMV coincide with the zones 3 (black soil) and 4 (gray-wooded soil) in the Agriculture map of Alberta (Hiruki, 1987) where legume seed industry and bee keeping industries are concentrated (Hiruki, unpublished data). There are three main species of bees to pollinate legume crops such as honey bees (Apis mellifera), leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata), and American bumble bees (Bombus fervidus). Honey bees are effective pollinators of a number of legume crops including sweet clover. However, honey bees are of little value as pollinator of alfalfa (Fairey, 2003). This fact may explain a minor incidence of SCNMV in alfalfa while frequent incidence of the same virus is observed in sweet clover in the same area (Hiruki, 1986a, Hiruki, 1986b, Hiruki et al., 1984). The occurrence of SCNMV in sweet clover in the forests, river banks, roadsides, and abandoned field may be explained by pollen transmission mediated mostly by honey bees and to lesser degrees by other bees.",

FNSV is detected consistently in the roots of infected fique plants (Morales et al., 1992). In nature, soil is a complex medium and acts as a heterogeneous environment. Its properties can be altered by seasonal climatic changes and agricultural practices in a particular area. This implies that any infective agents, such as viruses, introduced into the soil and drainage water may be affected by a variety of environmental factors or combination of several factors that are influenced by the interplay between the climate, vegetation, and soil type. It is also expected that the application of sewage and sludge to agricultural land may alter some of the soil\u2019s physical and chemical properties that affect viral survival.",

            "text": "Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the infection processes of the dianthoviruses has advanced greatly in recent years, as described in this review. These advances have also given rise to many interesting questions that are yet to be addressed. These questions include the differences in the gene expression strategies of RNA1 and RNA2. For example, RNA1 contains strong translation enhancer elements (3\u2032TE-DR1 and ARS), whereas RNA2 has no such elements: instead, the translation of MP is linked to the replication of RNA2 (Mizumoto et al., 2006). What do these differences in translation strategies mean? RNA1 and RNA2 might use distinct translation factors. The recruitment of MP to viral RNAs, a process essential for viral cell-to-cell movement, also differs between RNA1 and RNA2. The replication of RNA1, but not RNA2, is associated with MP recruitment to the ER-associated viral replication complexes (Kaido et al., 2009). This strategy might assist the cell-to-cell movement of RNA1, which does not encode MP. These findings also suggest that the replication complexes formed on RNA1 might differ from those on RNA2, and may localize to different sites on the ER. Indeed, RNA2 has an RNA element (YRE) that recruits p27 and the replicase complex (An et al., 2010, Hyodo et al., 2011), whereas RNA1 has no such recruiting element. The replication of RNA1 is linked to the translation of the replicase proteins (Iwakawa et al., 2011, Okamoto et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Another interesting question to be addressed is the mechanism that delivers the translation initiation factors from the 3\u2032-UTR of RCNMV RNA1 to the 5\u2032-UTR, where the ribosome starts to scan the template (Sarawaneeyaruk et al., 2009). In 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation, PABP plays an essential role in the binding of eIF4F/eIFiso4F to 3\u2032TE-DR1 (Iwakawa et al., 2012). It is generally believed that the binding of eIF4F and eIFiso4F to viral 3\u2032CITEs facilitates ribosome recruitment to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA via 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 communication, which is mediated by a long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction or a protein factor (Miller and White, 2006, Nicholson and White, 2011). However, the factors other than eIF4F/eIFiso4F or PABP that are required for 3\u2032CITE-mediated translation remain unclear. How the ribosome recognizes the uncapped 5\u00b4 end, even when eIF4F/iso4F is delivered to the vicinity of the 5\u00b4 end of RNA1 by 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 communication is also unclear. Although we do not know how RCNMV RNA1 achieves the communication between its 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends in 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation, our recent data suggest that the binding of eIF4F/iso4F and PABP to the 3\u2032-UTR of RCNMV RNA1 is important for delivering cap-binding factors other than eIF4F/iso4F and PABP to its nonfunctional G-capped 5\u2032 end, and in enhancing the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the viral mRNA (H. Iwakawa & T. Okuno, unpublished data). Identification of the proteins associated with the 5\u2032 end of RNA1 will help to clarify these unknown mechanisms.",

Genome-wide screens of the host factors that affect viral replication have been performed using yeast as the model host. The lists of host proteins obtained from these studies in yeast (Kushner et al., 2003, Panavas et al., 2005, Serviene et al., 2005), together with those obtained with other approaches, including those involving RCNMV, will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infection. This knowledge will contribute to the development of antiviral measures that are more efficient, which will reduce the disease-mediated damage caused by the virus infections. However, we must consider that both the viral and host factors that affect viral infection might differ in different combinations of viruses and hosts (Li and Wong, 2007, Sarawaneeyaruk et al., 2009).",
