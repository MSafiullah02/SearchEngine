The sharp change seen in some admission rates can be attributed to the introduction, in October 2007, of the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (ms-DRG) reimbursement system. Under ms-DRG, end-stage renal disease was ensconced as a major complicating condition (mCC), so its use as the leading secondary diagnosis increased markedly, thus displacing other diagnoses that were previously used to secure higher reimbursement. Notably, ms-DRG also altered the relative weights for a large number of diagnoses, including an increase in the relative weight for the diagnosis of fluid overload. In turn, since the advent of ms-DRG, raters of hospitalizations for fluid overload have ostensibly increased among dialysis patients. These shifts in coding practices secondary to shifts in reimbursement complicate the assessment of morbidity and, ultimately, the quality of care. True assessments of cause-specific hospitalization in the dialysis patient population should thus consider both specific and sensitive case definitions; this will be addressed more completely in the next edition of the Peer Report.",

            "text": "Data in this chapter illuminate important opportunities for providers to improve care across several domains. Seasonal and geographic variations in admission rates, for example, have important implications for novel approaches to risk reduction and to quality measurement in the public sphere. Coding drift-particularly for hospitalizations related heart failure, fluid overload, septicemia, and dialysis access infection-needs greater attention, particularly when data about such admissions are incorporated into performance metrics. Changes in the inpatient prospective payment system have created different billing incentives for hospitals, such that shifts in coding may be decoupled from shifts in the actual incidence of morbidity. Further, detailed investigation is needed to ensure that Medicare claims truly reflect the incidence of disease, rather than gaming of the reimbursement system. Ultimately, unambiguous outcomes such as death and allcause hospitalization may prove to be more consistent markers of health status among dialysis patients. Between the beginning of 1996 and the end of 2005, first-year hospital admission rates were unchanged. Subsequently, however, rates began to decline. Among patients in 2006, rates were more than 3 percent lower than among corresponding patients in 2005. Rates continued to fall among successive annual cohorts of incident patients, leading to a cumulative reduction of more than 0.2 admissions per patient year between 2005 and 2010.0Regional variation in rates is apparent, with a difference of more than 0.5 admissions per patient year between the Census Divisions with lowest and highest first-year hospital admission rates among incident dialysis patients in 2010.0This variation may indicate important differences in socioeconomic status and access to health care. The southern borders of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, for instance, are within the Ohio River basin, an area with high incidence of ESRD, substantial poverty, and historical air and water pollution. From this perspective, the absence of a downward trend in first-year hospitalization in the East North Central Division is concerning. B etween the beginning of 1996 and the end of 2005, there was little change in the admission rate among prevalent dialysis patients. Since the beginning of 2006, however, rates have begun to decline.0Among patients alive on January 1, 2006, the rate during the calendar year was more than 2 percent lower than among corresponding patients alive on January 1, 2005. In successive years, year-over-year declines in the rate were typically between 1 and 2 percent, for a cumulative reduction of more than 8 percent between 2005 and 2011.0Rates within calendar quarters and months follow strong cyclical patterns, a clear manifestation of seasonality. In recent years, the rate in the first quarter exceeds the corresponding rate in the fourth quarter by 7-10 percent. From this perspective, January and February are clear targets for quality improvement efforts, especially regarding infection control.0Progress has been markedly slower in some parts of the country. Some of these differences might be due to regional variation in influenza intensity, an area that merits further study. Alternatively, in states with much larger patient populations, there may be substantial variation in progress across metropolitan statistical areas within the states. ",

The first-year admission rate fell by more than 16 percent between annual cohorts of patients initiating chronic dialysis in 2003 and 2010. Among prevalent patients, the rate fell by more than 14 percent between 2004 and 2011.0Large differences in rates among Census Divisions persist, however. By the end of the study period, relative differences between divisions with the highest and lowest rates ranged from 25 to 30 percent. Some of this variation can certainly be attributed to case mix, as all of the displayed rates are unadjusted. The absence of parallel trends across the divisions, however, circumstantially suggests that regional opportunities for quality improvement exist. Increased prescription of and improved adherence to oral medications for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity may be one such opportunity.0An interesting aspect of admission rates for cardiovascular disease is the apparent seasonality in the prevalent population. In each year between 2008 and 2011, there are clear peaks in January or February. The reasons for this pattern are likely complex. Certainly, the incidence of communicable disease, particularly influenza, follows a seasonal pattern in the general population; epidemiologic studies show that seasonal patterns occur in cold-weather and warm-weather states alike, and some have suggested that the patterns are actually more profound in warmweather states. In the dialysis patient population, infectious diseases are likely to elicit inflammatory reactions that may engender subsequent cardiovascular events, resulting in the seasonal pattern displayed here. Some portion of the pattern may, however, be due to non-modifiable factors like air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and sunlight hours per day.0Cardiovascular morbidity comprises a diverse set of conditions which are important to consider in their own rights, as the pathophysiology and possible iatrogenic risk factors for each differ. In subsequent pages we explore acute coronary syndrome, comprising myocardial infarction and unstable angina; arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation; heart failure and the related conditions of cardiomyopathy, fluid overload, and pleural effusion; and stroke. In each case, there are challenges in interpreting Medicare claims submitted by hospitals, as the diagnosis codes used to document either the incidence or mere presence of specific diseases tend to be used more or less frequently as reimbursement rules evolve. For this reason, in the case of each specific cardiovascular condition, we display rates of hospital admissions defined by queries of the principal discharge diagnosis code and alternative queries of both the principal and leading secondary discharge diagnosis codes. In many cases, we find that the advent of Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) on October 1, 2007, resulted in substantial changes in secondary diagnosis coding.

            "text": "In 2011, prevalent patient cardiovascular admission rates were T he rate of hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) -which includes acute myocardial infarction, with or without ST-segment elevation, and angina pectoris-changed very little between 2003 and 2011, with a rate of roughly five admissions per 100 patient years during the first year of dialysis among incident patients, and of slightly more than four among prevalent patients. By far, the most common primary discharge diagnosis has been subendocardial infarction (i.e., NSTEMI).0The rate of hospitalization with either a primary or leading secondary diagnosis of ACS, in contrast, changed meaningfully during the same era, with a decline during the interval preceding the advent of MS-DRGs and a subtle increase during the interval afterward. That latter feature should be assessed closely in subsequent reports, as it may be a harbinger of further increases due to widening use of more sensitive troponin assays, rather than the leading edge of increased incidence. Regarding the broader definition including primary and leading secondary diagnoses, most of the decline during the interval preceding the advent of MS-DRGs can be attributed to sharp declines in coding of unstable angina, specifically intermediate coronary syndrome (ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 411.1), which was declared to be only a complicating condition under MS-DRG. This suggests that the incidence of unstable angina, in contrast to the incidence of myocardial infarction, may be more sensitive to reimbursement rules and thus more difficult to discern from Medicare claims.0There is some geographic variation in the incidence of coronary syndrome among both incident and prevalent dialysis patients, with a tendency toward higher rates in the northeastern quadrant of the country.0Among incident dialysis patients, there was a clear downward shift between 2003 and 2010 in the rate of hospitalization for ACS during the first three months of dialysis, and less of a shift thereafter. The reasons for this decrease in early risk are unclear. It may reflect better medication management before initiating dialysis, improved delivery of dialysis (specifically, better management of arterial blood pressure), or both.0Interestingly, there is strong evidence of seasonality in the incidence of ACS, with periodic peaks during the winter months and an especially high peak during the winter of 2011. This latter case is interesting in itself, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has characterized the severity of influenza during the winter of 2010-2011 as less pronounced than during the preceding winter. Of course, the final months of 2010, during which the rate of hospitalization for ACS spiked, also coincided with sharp changes in anemia management in anticipation of the ESRD Prospective Payment System, complicating attribution of the spike in risk to specific mechanisms. In any case, the recurrent wintertime peaks in hospitalization for ACS point toward a potentially fruitful target for quality improvement. H ospitalizations for arrhythmia include atrial, ventricular, and asystolic events, although atrial fibrillation has been the most common primary discharge diagnosis, at least among prevalent dialysis patients in 2011. The rate of hospitalization with arrhythmia as the primary discharge diagnosis was constant during the study era among both incident and prevalent dialysis patients. In contrast, admissions with arrhythmia as either the primary or leading secondary discharge diagnosis exhibited a substantial decline before the advent of MS-DRGs. This can be attributed almost exclusively to less intensive coding of atrial fibrillation (ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 427.31). In fact, the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation not only evaporated in the leading secondary discharge diagnosis slot, but declined meaningfully in all of the first four secondary slots. This begs the question of whether more than incidence of the most severe cases of arrhythmia can be reliably estimated from Medicare claims; this is certainly a topic that merits further analysis in subsequent reports. Also among incident patients, it is noteworthy that the admission rate for arrhythmia as the principal diagnosis during the first three months of dialysis actually increased between the annual cohorts in 2003 and 2010.0There is substantial regional variation in the rate of hospitalization for arrhythmia, particularly during the first year of dialysis among incident patients. Seasonality of arrhythmia admissions is not apparent.0Several issues related to arrhythmia merit further exploration, such as the timing of events across days of the dialysis week, the risk of hyperkalemia during the long interdialytic interval, and the risk of post-dialysis hypokalemia and other iatrogenic electrolyte changes. Foley et al. reported an increased risk of hospitalization and death on the first day of the dialysis week (NEJM). Unknown is whether these events occur predominantly before or after dialysis. Either could be the case, and each poses different challenges. If the apparent risk manifests before dialysis, hyperkalemia is the likely issue; this could be investigated by determining if the condition appears as a leading secondary diagnosis. If, however, the apparent risk manifests after dialysis, metabolic changes during treatment need to be considered.0There are also concerns about the use of low potassium dialysis baths (K \u2264 2.0) for patients with pre-potassium levels less than 5.0 mEq/L, and about the relatively low magnesium level (0.75-1.0 mEq/L), which has not changed for more than 30 years. A recent study in Japan found that lower predialysis serum magnesium is associated with a higher risk of death, suggesting that more analyses are needed to determine an effective and safe level. The level of calcium in the dialysate should also be examined, particularly among patients using calcium-containing phosphate binders. Baths in which the calcium level is less than 2.5 mg/dL may cause prolonged QT intervals, potentially increasing the risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. New ",

            "text": "A dmissions for heart failure, as well as for the related pathology of cardiomyopathy, are very common among dialysis patients. Explicit designations of heart failure in Medicare claims, however, do not tell the entire story. From a clinical perspective, heart failure and fluid overload can be difficult to distinguish. A diagnosis of heart failure implies that the major area of dysfunction is cardiac in nature, arising from systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, or both, while a diagnosis of fluid overload suggests that the major problem is volumetric, with cardiac function relatively intact. But these are pathophysiologic principles. The extent to which they extend to coding practices is at least partially dictated by the detailed features of MS-DRGs and the relative rates of reimbursement that accompany alternative arrangements of diagnosis codes. On these two pages we explore admissions for heart failure and cardiomyopathy; on the next two we look at admissions for fluid overload and pleural effusion, a common consequence of fluid overload.0Admissions for a primary discharge diagnosis of heart failure, which are overwhelmingly ascertained from ICD-9-CM diagnosis code series 428, appear to have decreased in frequency during the study era among both incident and prevalent dialysis patients. After the advent of MS-DRGs, rates of admission for a primary or leading secondary diagnosis of heart failure were only modestly higher than corresponding rates based on the primary diagnosis alone. There is substantial geographic variation, particularly among incident dialysis patients, in which first-year admission rates vary by a factor of two between the Census Divisions with highest and lowest rates. Between the annual cohorts of incident dialysis patients from 2003 and 2010, there were improvements in admission rates during every month of the first year of dialysis. Among prevalent patients, there is clear evidence of seasonality -similar to, if not more pronounced than, the seasonality observed in admissions for acute coronary syndrome.0While the rate of hospitalization for heart failure appears to have declined since 2003, analyses displayed in the subsequent pair of pages show that hospitalizations for fluid overload appear to have increased by a roughly commensurate amount since 2006. Collectively, hospitalization for the composite of heart failure and fluid overload appears to have changed very little since 2003. The fact that these rates are unadjusted should certainly be given due consideration, as the gradual aging of the dialysis population has likely increased the underlying risk of heart failure. Nonetheless, these data suggest that increased attention to fluid control is warranted. ",

On these pages we explore hospitalization for fluid overload and the related complication of pleural effusion. The set of diagnosis codes marking such admissions is concise and, among prevalent dialysis patients in 2011, admissions with primary discharge diagnoses of fluid overload outnumbered those for pleural effusion by a ratio of about four to one.0Unlike the rate of hospitalization for heart failure, the rate for fluid overload has tended to increase, especially since 2006. Once again, the evolution of reimbursement likely plays an important role. Both before and after the advent of MS-DRGs, the principal diagnosis of fluid overload (ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 276.6) has been mapped to DRGs regarding miscellaneous disorders of nutrition, metabolism, fluid, and electrolytes -entirely distinct from those regarding heart failure. Importantly, the advent of MS-DRGs substantially increased the relative weight (i.e., reimbursement rate) of the DRGs regarding miscellaneous disorders of nutrition, metabolism, fluid, and electrolytes, although only to a level that remained substantially below the relative weight of DRGs regarding heart failure. Interestingly, the ordering of Census Divisions by rate of hospitalization for fluid overload and pleural effusion appears quite different than that for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. In short, the story of heart failure and fluid overload appears to be frayed at the edges. There is evidence of coding shifts between the two diagnoses during the study era, and of regional variation in coding practices. Further analyses are needed to examine methodologies for identifying these admissions, so trends can be reliably estimated. New S trokes can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic in nature. Ischemic strokes may occur due to narrowing of the cerebral vessels, secondary to calcification, and, among prevalent dialysis patients in 2011, were much more common than hemorrhagic strokes.0Unlike admission rates for other diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, those for stroke have clearly decreased, with no interference wrought by the advent of MS-DRGs. In both the incident and prevalent dialysis patient populations, rates have decreased by 20 percent or more. Because of the catastrophic nature of stroke and its consequences on physical function and quality of life, this decline is an important sign of progress. Regional variation in the incidence of stroke has been also limited. Particularly striking is the decline in incidence of stroke during the first year of dialysis among incident patients in the East South Central area, which includes most of the so-called Stroke Belt states; there, the first-year admission rate for stroke was cut in half between 2003 and 2010.0Among incident dialysis patients, the admission rate for stroke declined during the entire first year of dialysis between 2003 and 2010, with a particularly large decrease during the second month of dialysis. It remains true, however, that the risk of stroke is elevated during the first three months of dialysis, relative to the remainder of the first year. Early stroke is therefore a possible target for quality improvement.0Seasonality is not apparent in the incidence of stroke among prevalent dialysis patients, although epidemiologic studies have suggested that ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes may follow different seasonal patterns, with the risk of hemorrhagic stroke actually peaking during the spring season.0Regarding hemorrhagic stroke specifically, there are some published data suggesting iatrogenic risk associated with warfarin exposure, particularly among patients with atrial fibrillation. Little is known about regional and facility-level variation in the use of warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants; use of the latter remain rare, but may grow in coming years, as randomized trials of their use in hemodialysis patients are completed.

The relatively large discordance between rates based on primary diagnosis codes and on corresponding rates based on both primary and leading diagnosis codes may partially reflect the development of bloodstream infections during hospitalization for localized infections. Medicare claims in the modern era include present-on-admission (POA) codes that may be exploited to assess the development of complications during hospitalization, although there are no published data about the use of these codes among hospitalized dialysis patients.0While rates varied by 100 percent between the Census Divisions with the lowest and highest first-year admission rates among incident dialysis patients in 2010, the secular trend of increasing rates was consistent across all divisions. Among incident dialysis patients, rates were highest in the Middle Atlantic, East North Central, and Pacific Divisions. Among prevalent patients, these same areas were joined by the West North Central Division.0Again likely a manifestation of early reliance on catheters for vascular access, admission rates for bacteremia and septicemia during the first year of dialysis actually peak during the second month of dialysis, in contrast to the consistent peaks of admissions for specific forms of cardiovascular disease during the first month.

Thus, even if a substantial minority of the hospitalized cases of septicemia were originally due to infections of sites other than the vascular access, it would be true that the incidence of hospitalization for either simple or complicated infection of the access did not change during the study era.

This is an interesting finding, as the percentage of black patients is generally high in both of these areas. Dialysis providers may consider quality improvement efforts targeted at vascular access care among black patients.0The seasonality of hospitalization for dialysis access infections is vivid, but the timing of peaks and nadirs during the annual cycle is different than for many other pathologies, including cardiovascular events. In the case of access infections, the rate of hospitalization peaks during summer months and reaches its annual nadir during the winter. Potential explanations include the impact of skin perspiration on bacterial growth, as well as bacterial growth in pools, lakes (including lakes used for drinking water), and private wells. There have been no detailed studies about the seasonal pattern of access infections."

Adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and enteroviruses likely all contribute to the milieu of pathogens that engender pneumonia. On the other hand, because viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, it is reasonable to hypothesize that hospitalized cases of pneumonia are more likely to be bacterial in etiology. Regardless of etiology, the seasonality of admission rates for pneumonia and influenza among prevalent dialysis patients is tremendously clear. This seasonality is intuitive, but has not been reported in the past.

The timing of such high rates is important, as many dialysis patients are malnourished at the initiation of chronic dialysis, due to poor appetite that accompanies worsening uremia prior to initiating dialysis. Among prevalent dialysis patients, there is some evidence of seasonality, which might reflect increased use of oral antibiotics for respiratory infection during the winter season.0All of these trends, along with trends of hospitalization for infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, should be watched closely, as the increase in C. difficile infection is underappreciated, with many patients simply receiving outpatient treatment."

The source of the bleed determines how much of the blood is dissolved in the gut versus passed in the stool and thereby recognized with a clinical diagnosis. Hematochezia, or bright red blood in the stool, is wellknown as having sources in the lower gastrointestinal tract, including hemorrhoids, diverticular bleeding, colonic ulcers, and potentially, colonic polyps or cancers. Upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding is typically recognized by the melena color of the stool, as stomach acid reduces the hemoglobin content of the blood. This bleeding can lead to catabolism of the hemoglobin from pancreatic enzymes, raising the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creating a disproportionate BUN/serum creatinine ratio. Each 100 milliliters of packed cells contains approximately 10 grams of protein, which can be a significant load in addition to the recommended daily intake of one gram per kilogram. Gastrointestinal bleeding, therefore, has a relatively widespread impact, beyond direct blood loss and reduction of oxygen-carrying capacity.0First-year rates of hospitalization for a primary discharge diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding increased slightly during the study era among incident dialysis patients, but rose more meaningfully among prevalent patients between 2004 and 2011. Regional variation is apparent and, at least among prevalent dialysis patients, consistent with the nature of variation for many diagnoses of cardiovascular disease and infection. Specifically, admission rates are highest in the Middle Atlantic and East North Central Divisions and lowest in the Mountain and Pacific areas.0Rates exhibit modest seasonality, but, perhaps more importantly, increased notably in 2011, coinciding with the introduction of the ESRD Prospective Payment System and the Food and Drug Administration's later decision to add a \"black box\" warning to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. It is possible that, as hemoglobin levels fell in the dialysis patient population, and as more patients presented in acute care settings with very low hemoglobin concentrations, ascertainment of gastrointestinal bleeding also increased, as hospitalists sought to identify factors other than the anemia of chronic kidney disease that may engender especially low hemoglobin. Future reports will continue to monitor this outcome and assess the extent to which the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and the rate of red blood cell transfusions are related. ",

            "text": "C hronic pulmonary disease is common among dialysis patients, and constitutes an important risk factor for respiratory failure. Rates of hospitalization for a primary discharge diagnosis of acute respiratory failure increased during the early portion of the study era, plateaued, and subsequently declined. Unlike many other conditions, in which rates estimated with contrasting definitions have tended to converge since the advent of MS-DRGs, the rate of hospitalization for either a primary or leading secondary discharge diagnosis of acute respiratory failure has recently diverged from the corresponding rate for a primary discharge diagnosis alone. This divergence creates uncertainty about the true frequency of respiratory failure among dialysis patients. The totality of the data, however, as well as the high prevalence of mechanisms that may lead to respiratory failure, suggest that the event is not rare. Fluid overload, as might be observed among patients with heart failure or pneumonia, clearly increases the risk of respiratory failure. And with stroke another risk factor, it is perhaps unsurprising that the absolute magnitude of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure among prevalent dialysis patients in 2011 is similar to the corresponding magnitude of hospitalization for stroke.0There is some regional variation in admission rates. Areas with the highest rates include the East North Central, West North Central, and East South Central Divisions. In the case of the first two divisions, an important commonality is the Ohio River Valley, an area with historical pollution, including air pollution from industrial processes. Particulate matter is an established factor for exacerbations of pulmonary disease, including acute respiratory failure.0The aberrant increase in hospitalizations for acute respiratory failure during the winter of 2011 is of unclear etiology, and certainly might represent anomalous coding practices that were quickly resolved. On the other hand, the peak coincides perfectly with a spike in hospitalizations for heart failure, underscoring the connection between volume status, cardiac function, and pulmonary function. C hronic pulmonary disease spans a variety of conditions, including bronchitis and emphysema. Data presented earlier in this report show that the Medical Evidence Report severely underestimates the prevalence of current or former tobacco use among incident dialysis patients, suggesting that an important underlying cause of exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease in the dialysis population is alveolar damage due to smoking.0The rate of hospitalization for a primary discharge diagnosis of chronic pulmonary disease increased modestly during the study era. Perhaps more striking than the secular trend, however, is the regional variation in rates. Among incident dialysis patients in 2010, first-year admissions vary by more than a factor of two between the Census Divisions with lowest and highest rates. The story is similar among prevalent dialysis patients. Interestingly, in the prevalent population, rates have been highest in the East North Central states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that smoking prevalence in Kentucky and Ohio is among the highest in the nation. Obviously, there is little that dialysis providers can do to compensate for damage wrought by tobacco use before dialysis initiation. All of these data collectively suggest that a history of tobacco use may be an underappreciated risk adjustment factor in dialysis facility surveillance.0There is clear evidence of seasonality in admission rates for chronic pulmonary disease, with annual peaks during the winter months. These peaks likely point to the involvement of respiratory infection in engendering acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease.0The treatment of chronic pulmonary disease involves medications such as bronchodilators and steroids. While the impact of these medications typically receives little attention, they may increase the risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Beta agonists, in tandem with the use of QT-prolonging antibiotics and the electrolyte shifts that occur during dialysis, may expose dialysis patients to iatrogenic risk of sudden cardiac death. The complex nature of chronic disease management requires more devotion to lowering such risks.",

            "text": "D ialysis access complications, excluding infection of the access, typically relate to placement of and revisions to a permanent vascular access, such as a fistula or a graft, but also include procedures to correct the malfunction of a peritoneal dialysis catheter.0During the study era, hospitalizations with a primary discharge diagnosis of dialysis access complications declined very steadily. This is entirely consistent with the trend of treating access complications in outpatient settings, including ambulatory surgical centers, vascular access centers, and physician offices. As a result, any comprehensive analysis of dialysis access complications in the current era must assess events in both inpatient and outpatient settings.0Rates of admission for these complications have fallen across the country, although there continues to be some regional variation in first-year rates among incident dialysis patients. This is an interesting observation in its own right, as it suggests that the utilization of inpatient care for surgical interventions that might be performed in either inpatient or outpatient settings may partially reflect the supply of outpatient care in a locale, a point that has not been discussed in any public debate about the utility of standardized hospitalization ratios.0The relatively high rate of admission during the first six months of dialysis likely reflects early revisions to fistulas and grafts -a precise set of hospitalizations that would not occur if permanent accesses were not placed. Early malfunction of a peritoneal dialysis catheter can also occur, and is likely to be overrepresented in Medicare claims, as home dialysis training entitles patients to Medicare coverage immediately upon initiation of chronic dialysis.0Unlike the pattern seen with dialysis access infection, there appears to be very little seasonality in the incidence of access complications necessitating hospitalization. H yperkalemia can be a life-threatening complication, impacting electrical conduction systems in the heart and muscle cells. The normal range of potassium is approximately 3.5-5.2 mEq/L, but dialysis patients frequently manifest pre-run levels exceeding 6.0 mEq/L. Chronic dialysis patients have a somewhat greater tolerance for potassium levels above the normal range, but the risk of cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation is still present.0While diet is the most common reason for hyperkalemia, additional causes include gastrointestinal bleeding and catabolism of blood from hematomas, such as from retroperitoneal bleeds or access infiltrations. Hemolysis rarely causes hyperkalemia, but it is life-threatening when it occurs. Moreover, numerous drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, can cause hyperkalemia by interfering with residual renal function and gastrointestinal tract excretion. Regardless of the cause, the clinical challenge is treatment, which must immediately address conduction problems in the heart. Conservative treatments include dextrose with insulin, intravenous bicarbonate, intravenous calcium, beta agonists, and potassium-binding resins, which either shift potassium into cells or trap potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, buying time for the patient to receive dialysis.0Rates of admission for the principal discharge diagnosis of hyperkalemia have been fairly stable, but increased slightly at the end of the study era in both the incident and prevalent dialysis populations. In the dialysis population, hospital stays for infectious complications tend to be longer than those for cardiovascular complications. And third, the length of stay per admission, which can be affected by hospitals discharging patients sooner in an attempt to control costs.0Admissions per patient year declined during the study era, but hospitalized days declined more rapidly. This pattern is compatible with a theoretical shift toward more admissions for cardiovascular disease, but in reality, cardiovascular-related admissions were declining more rapidly than infection-related admissions. The conclusion, therefore, is that dialysis patients were progressively discharged more quickly after admission.0Shortened lengths of stay raise concerns, because readmission may be related to inadequate preparation for discharge. Dialysis patients have a complex set of issues to address after discharge, but dialysis facilities have had difficulty acquiring adequate information from discharging hospitals. Facility staff must have information about a patient's new dry weight and changes in the dialysis prescription. Potassium and calcium baths may have been altered in the hospital, where there is more dietary control. Changes in medication must be resolved, particularly with respect to cardiovascular agents and antibiotics. Facility staff must also be apprised of anticipated follow-up care, so that outpatient plans can be coordinated.0New regulations on conditions of participation, issued by CMS in May 2013, indicate that dialysis units should receive the same information that hospitals release to nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Whether hospitals are being held accountable for the transfer of this information is unclear. T he building blocks of hospital readmission analysis are Medicare Part A claims for inpatient care. Analysis is complicated, however, by vagaries of the claims, including overlapping dates of care across multiple claims, adjoining dates possibly reflecting transfers between hospitals, and revisions for proper reimbursement. These vagaries must be carefully addressed before analysis commences.0 During 2011, there were 571,737 live discharges among patients who received chronic dialysis treatment upon discharge; 95 percent occurred in patients who received chronic dialysis treatment both before and after hospitalization. Most discharges were made by short-term and critical access hospitals. Among such hospitals with at least one discharge, there was wide variation in the cumulative number of discharges during the year. Approximately 34 percent of hospitals made just 1-10 discharges during 2011. Another 23 percent made 11-100 discharges during the year. For the remainder of hospitals, 101-500 discharges were typical; only 6.5 percent made more than 500 discharges during 2011.0 Discharge status is determined by the hospital and attending physician, and often reflects the overall condition of the patient. Among discharges made by short-term and critical access hospitals, patients were typically discharged to home, under selfcare; a skilled nursing facility; or home, under the supervision of a home health agency. Other statuses comprised only 6.3 percent of discharges.0 Among the three principal statuses, the 30-day readmission rate was lowest for patients discharged to home, under self-care (32.1 percent); intermediate for patients discharged to home, under supervision of a home health agency (37.9 percent); and highest for patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility (39.7 percent). The probability of death in the 30 days following live discharge followed the same trend among the three statuses. C ompared to all Medicare beneficiaries, the 30-day readmission rate in dialysis patients is highly elevated. During all of 2011, the rate was 34.7 percent, higher than corresponding rates in all years dating to 1996, other than the preceding year.0Across quarters and months, rates vary unpredictably, although within a relatively narrow absolute range. In recent years, they tend to be highest among discharges in the first and third quarters of each year. This pattern may be due to differences in admission rates for specific discharge diagnoses, which often follow seasonal patterns.0Like hospital admission rates, readmission rates vary across Census The etiology of early versus late readmissions likely differs substantially. Very early readmissions may reflect inappropriately premature discharge or poor preparation for discharge. Readmission may, in fact, occur before the patient receives outpatient dialysis, as in the case of a patient discharged on Friday and not scheduled to dialyze until Monday. On the other hand, late readmissions may reflect poor adherence to newly prescribed medications or suboptimal treatment by dialysis providers, leading to recurrence of cardiovascular instability or worsening infection.0In 2011, the cumulative readmission rate was 5.3 percent within three days after discharge and 12.1 percent within seven days. With each subsequent seven-day interval, the cumulative readmission rate decreased more slowly.0Rates of both readmission and death during the 30 days following live discharge vary according to the principal discharge diagnosis. For discharges with cardiovascular disease, the 30-day readmission rate in 2011 was 35.4 percent; the corresponding rate for discharges with infection was 33.5 percent.0Among discharges with cardiovascular disease, 30-day readmission is most likely for acute coronary syndrome, primarily due to higher risk of early readmission, as is consistent with worsening heart failure after myocardial infarction. Readmission is least likely for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Risk of death within 30 days of discharge is also highest for acute coronary syndrome.0Among discharges with infection, 30-day readmission is most likely for intestinal infection with C. difficile and for bacteremia and septicemia. For both categories, readmission rates within 10 days of discharge exceed 18 percent. The readmission rate is lowest for dialysis access infections. Risk of death within 30 days of discharge is highest for bacteremia and septicemia, at 4.2 percent.0The rate of 30-day readmission is relatively high for acute respiratory failure and relatively low for dialysis access complications, excluding infection.
