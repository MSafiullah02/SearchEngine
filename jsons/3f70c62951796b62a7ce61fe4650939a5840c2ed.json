Our data shows older LTCF residents, especially those with dementia or in a bedridden state, frequently developed pneumonia due to hMPV when compared with other residents. Moreover, high fever, respiratory failure, wheezing, and elevated WBC, CRP, AST, ALT, and CPK levels were frequently observed among hMPV pneumonia cases. Typical hMPV pneumonia chest images exhibit proximal bronchial wall thickenings radiating outward from the hilum. Although it is frequently the cause of a mild, self-limiting respiratory infection in healthy children and adults, hMPV infection can also induce a severe infection in the elderly. Falsey et al [20] reported that older adults more frequently experience dyspnea and wheezing, during the course of the disease, compared with younger patients.

Darniot et al [21] also demonstrated that older mice develop a more severe hMPV infection compared with young mice. Nevertheless, outbreaks of hMPV also occurred in LTCF for intellectually disabled patients (facilities A and C), where residents were not elderly. In general, the immune system of intellectually disabled patients is not weak; however, we speculate they may have been susceptible to hMPV due to isolation and lack of exposure to natural infection of hMPV for an extended time. Therefore, it is possible their antibodies against hMPV might be unusually diminished.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 761, "end": 765, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1193, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1304, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The present study demonstrated that WBC and CRP, AST, ALT, and CPK concentrations were higher in patients with pneumonia than non-pneumonia infections. Although Scheuerman et al [22] reported that AST and ALT were slightly human immunodeficiency virus, and coxsackie virus are the most commonly documented [23] , whereas Legionella species, Francisella tularensis, and S. pneumoniae [23, 24] are common among bacterial pathogens. Respiratory pathogens, such as Chlamydophila psittaci and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been implicated [25] . However, neither rhabdomyolysis nor elevated levels of CPK have been reported in patients with hMPV pneumonia before. More importantly, these data indicate that hMPV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis when we treat pneumonia patients with elevated CPK. Chest imaging revealed bronchial wall thickenings radiating out from the hilum were common for hMPV pneumonia. Proximal tramlines arising out from the hilum seem like \"spider legs\" on the chest x-ray. Although some studies report the radiological findings of hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, studies conducted within immunocompetent A \u00c1 BB adults or the elderly are limited. Previous studies have shown interstitial infiltrates, GGO, as well as centrilobular nodules suggestive of bronchitis and bronchiolitis are common radiological features for hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, only 1 report describes chest images among elderly, immunocompetant inpatients during an hMPV outbreak. Four of the 8 affected patients had abnormal shadows in the chest x-ray, and 3 of the 4 had linear shadows and were diagnosed with hMPV-induced bronchitis or bronchiolitis [17] . Because ciliated airway epithelial cells are the primary targets for hMPV infection [30] , it is easily justifiable for bronchial wall thickenings, evidence of bronchitis or bronchiolitis, to be common radiological features in hMPV pneumonia. Centrilobular nodules, interstitial infiltrates, and GGO were not frequently observed in the present study. It is possible that an immunocompromised host's weaker immune response to hMPV may allow the virus to spread into the peripheral bronchiole and lung parenchyma.

Due to the restrictions of the national health insurance system in Japan, RAT and PCR testing for hMPV is not approved for diagnostic decisions in adult patients. As such, attending physicians in each LTCF consulted the University of the Ryukyus' Department of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory, and Digestive Medicine as each outbreak waned. As a result, only a subset of affected patients could be tested. Other laboratory testing, bacterial cultures, and imaging tests (eg, chest x-ray and CT) were also only performed on subsets of patients. Moreover, by including fever in the case definition, it is possible that the mildest forms of hMPV infection were overlooked. Elderly patients do not always exhibit fever during infection. However, using respiratory symptoms alone may have broadened the case definition beyond usefulness. Our cohort contained multiple, and in many cases severe, underlying disorders.
