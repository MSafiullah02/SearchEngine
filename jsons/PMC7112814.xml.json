There was a positive correlation between the OD405 values in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and the neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 1). Furthermore, sequential change in OD405 in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers in 19 subjects, in whom sero-conversion was demonstrated, was evaluated (Fig. 3). Four of the 19 had already had antibody to SARS-CoV rNP detectable by SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA, although at this stage they had not yet had a neutralizing antibody equal to or over 20. On the other hand, only one serum sample that showed a positive reaction in neutralizing antibody assay at a titer of 20 showed a negative reaction in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 3). These results suggest that this SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is as sensitive as the neutralizing antibody assay. Therefore, it can be concluded that the newly developed SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is useful for the serological diagnosis of and seroepidemiological study on SARS-CoV infections.",

(2003) first reported that SARS-CoV rNP would be one of the candidates for the antigen to detect SARS-CoV antibodies. They confirmed that three of the nine serum samples collected from the patients clinically diagnosed as having SARS showed a positive reaction in SARS-CoV rNP-based Western blotting. The SARS-CoV rNP was then expressed in an E. coli system and used as antigen in an antigen-capturing ELISA. It was reported that the antigen-capturing ELISA had high specificity of about 98%, though the sensitivity was not evaluated in the study (Shi et al., 2003). Recently, Guan et al. also reported the efficacy of the recombinant protein of SARS-CoV-based IgG ELISA in diagnosis of SARS (Guan et al., 2004). The SARS-CoV rNP was also expressed in E. coli transformed with an expression vector. However, these systems were not compared with the neutralizing antibody assay that is considered to be a gold standard.",
