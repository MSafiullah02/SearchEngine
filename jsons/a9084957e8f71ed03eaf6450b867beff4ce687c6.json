            "text": "Novel coronavirus , also known as SARS CoV-2, is a pathogen causing an emerging infection that rapidly increases in incidence and geographic range, is associated with the ever-increasing morbidity and mortality rates, and shows sever economic impact worldwide. The WHO declares the NCoV-19 infection disease (COVID- 19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently, on March 11, 2020, declared it a Global Pandemic. Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe. The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient's condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities. Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts. The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models.",

The virus is given name Coronavirus due to the similarity of its spike protein to the crown (Latin corona) [3] . SARS CoV-2 virus belongs to group IV Coronaviruses and is the member of the order Nidoviriales, Family Coronaviridae, Subfamily Coronavirinae, and Genus Betacoronavirus [4] . The virus genome is a~30 kb positivesense single-stranded RNA that encodes structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. The virion is enveloped and spherical with a diameter of 60-140 nm and with the spike length of 9-12 nm. The phylogenetic study suggested a closer relation of this virus to bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-CoVZC45 than to human SARS [5] . The early cases reported infection in people after attending the seafood and animal market, thereby suggesting the animal to human transmission of the virus. The later cases indicated the sustained human to human transmission of SARS CoV-2 [6, 7] . Human to human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and fomites. The primary site of infection is in epithelial cells of respiratory or enteric tracts while secondary sites are kidney and heart though in question [8] . Currently, there is no cure for the COVID-19, and clinicians are solely depending upon the drugs that could provide symptomatic relief. The clinical trials are performed using drugs that have been known to treat other viral infections/related diseases.",

To ensure the effective internalization of the potential drugs with demonstrated activity against the viral protease, polymerase, and RNA, serum albumin could be used as an excellent delivery vehicle. Serum albumin is a multifunctional protein known to interact with a range of exogenous and endogenous compounds. It is predominately present in the extracellular space, with high concentration being reported in the skin, guts, muscles, fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural), and secretions such as sweat, tear, milk, and saliva [10] . The wellknown fact about albumin is that there is a complex relationship between the inflammation and albumin level in the extracellular matrix under various physiological and pathological conditions [11] [12] [13] . The earlier studies indicated that the stressed and inflamed cells increase the uptake of albumin [11] [12] [13] .",

            "text": "The recent studies support the albumin therapy of COVID-19 patients since there is the complex relation of albumin concentration and ACE2 receptor expression in the cells, ACE2 receptors are crucial in mediating the virus infection [23] . If the albumin is used to stabilize and deliver the EGCG and Curcumin for targeting the intracellular virus components in combination with the drug that could block the virus fusion and/or entry to a cell, this strategy might represent an effective way of treating the SARS CoV-2 infection. EGCG and Curcumin combination is proven to be very effective in treating various pathological conditions by augmenting the key cellular signaling [24] [25] [26] . The inhibition of these key cellular pathways also helps in inhibiting the virus multiplication inside the cells as reported in the case of SARS-CoV [27] [28] [29] . In addition to their antiviral outcomes, curcumin and EGCG are known for their health-boosting properties [30, 31] .",
