Povidone-iodine is a complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine that targets structures needed for survival and replication (eg, neuraminidase for viral propagation via infection of noninfected cells and hemagglutinin for attachment). This results in multimodal activity.7 Povidone-iodine has rapid and effective virucidal activity against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) with at least a 4 log10 (99.99%) inactivation of both pathogens within 15 seconds.7,8 This represents more antiviral potency than alcoholic and nonalcoholic hand sanitizers and soaps.7 Our reason for using chlorhexidine gluconate was that it is available in the US as Peridex oral rinse. While chlorhexidine gluconate is less effective than povidone-iodine,8 it has activity against enveloped viruses on skin and in the oral cavity (0.12%) with viral inactivation in as little as 30 seconds.9 The inactivity of chlorhexidine rinse against the poliovirus is presumed to be related to lack of an envelope.9 Because the COVID-19 virus is enveloped, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% is likely to have similar activity against the virus as it does against other enveloped viruses.10",

Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that it would be ill-advised to avoid use of these evidence-based preventive measures. These steps are part of a comprehensive program that stands on a solid body of published evidence established duringthe past14 years.2\u20136",
