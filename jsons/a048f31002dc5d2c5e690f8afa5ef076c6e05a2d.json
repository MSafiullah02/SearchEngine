Abstract: Background: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among transplant patients. The CDC's influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria (fever \u2265100\u00b0F with cough and/or sore throat) are a screening tool for influenza with unknown applicability to the transplant population. Methods: We reviewed all respiratory virus PCR tests performed on adult patients with a history of solid organ (SOT) or stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during the 2012-2013 influenza season. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ILI criteria were calculated. Results: Of 126 transplant patients (66 HSCT, 60 SOT), 54 (42.8%) tested positive for an RVI by PCR: 24 influenza and 30 non-influenza.

Interestingly, we found that the NPV of ILI criteria for confirmed influenza was relatively high at 82.4% and the presence of rhinorrhea was found to predict non-influenza RVI. The combination of rhinorrhea and a failure to meet ILI criteria may be useful in identifying transplant patients with a non-influenza RVI. However, signs and symptoms of influenza and non-influenza viruses overlap greatly, and it is unrealistic to expect clinicians to distinguish them clinically even during peak influenza season.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the past, ILI criteria were used to rapidly triage patients with possible influenza while awaiting results of viral culture, which could take 2-5 d. Although there is a prolonged turnaround time, these traditional viral culture techniques routinely allowed for identification of viruses other than influenza, including RSV, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. However, with the availability of rapid molecular diagnostics, the utility of the ILI criteria has diminished. Multiplex respiratory virus PCR testing has the ability for rapid and accurate testing for numerous respiratory viruses and has therefore largely replaced viral cultures as the diagnostic gold standard. Multiplex respiratory virus PCR provides discrimination between many respiratory viral pathogens with a high level of specificity and sensitivity, including determination of the specific influenza subtype (8) . Unfortunately, there have been barriers to widespread implementation of multiplex PCR testing. These tests are moderate to highly complex assays which preclude near-patient testing (9) . There is also increased cost associated with PCR testing. Therefore, simple, rapid antigen point-of-care tests with poor sensitivities and single targets (i.e., influenza) are frequently used in the outpatient setting, where a large portion of RVI testing occurs (32% in our study). However, in the inpatient setting, the increased cost of multiplex PCR testing is offset by the reduction in hospital length of stay associated with more sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostics (9) (10) (11) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1067, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1552, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "More importantly, identifying specific non-influenza pathogens has important treatment and prognostic implications. In our study, non-influenza viruses as a whole (n = 30) were a more common cause of RVI than influenza (n = 24). In addition to the known benefits of prompt administration of antiviral therapy to patients with influenza, there are data suggesting a potential role for the use of systemic or inhaled ribavirin for the treatment of RSV infection among adult HSCT recipients (12) . Studies of experimental agents for the treatment of other RVIs are also ongoing (13) . Further, identification of a non-influenza RVI may allow for discontinuation of unnecessary oseltamivir and antibacterial therapy. Regarding prognosis, recent data by Campbell et al. (14) showed that infection with any respiratory virus pre-allogeneic HSCT (including rhinovirus) was associated with lower 100-d survival. Mortality was low in our transplant cohort. This may be due to the long median duration of time from transplant (median 4.1 yr, range 0-23 yr) as the mortality secondary to infection is greatest in the highly immunosuppressed early post-transplant period. We also found a low incidence of bacterial superinfection, which may represent underestimation due to failure to microbiologically confirm secondary bacterial pneumonia. However, there was significant morbidity associated with non-influenza RVI among our transplant recipients as assessed by length of hospitalization and need for ICU level of care. Additionally, the only bacterial superinfection among our cohort occurred in a patient with a non-influenza RVI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 492, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 575, "end": 579, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 765, "end": 769, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, 58 of 126 (46%) of patients tested were vaccinated against influenza. Among the 24 transplant patients who tested positive for influenza, nearly one-third (7) had received influenza vaccination earlier in the season. There was not a significant difference in the incidence of vaccine failure between HSCT patients (4/18, 22.0%) and SOT patients (3/40, 7.5%) (p = 0.18). One vaccinated HSCT patient diagnosed with influenza A required ICU admission and expired. Inactivated influenza vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients, and all transplant recipients are encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination (2) . Vaccine efficacy within the general population varies from year to year and is largely dependent upon the degree of antigenic match between the influenza strains in the vaccine and those circulating in the community (15) . Unfortunately, even in the setting of a good match, vaccine efficacy may be reduced among transplant recipients, particularly in the early post-transplant period (16, 17) . Because of the reduced immunogenicity of vaccines in the early post-transplant period, influenza vaccination is not recommended until 3-6 months after transplantation (18, 19) . This leaves patients who are transplanted during influenza season at particularly high risk. These findings highlight the importance of good infection control practices, vaccination of transplant recipients' close contacts, and prompt diagnosis and treatment of influenza in transplant recipients regardless of vaccine history. Our study has several limitations. Most notably, the retrospective design resulted in inconsistently available data regarding the presenting symptoms. Second, our sample size is small and the study was performed in a single tertiary medical center. Additionally, the entire influenza season was not captured. The period included in this study (December through February) represents the peak of the influenza season. This period of high influenza prevalence was thought to be the ideal time to test the accuracy of the CDC ILI criteria for PCR-confirmed influenza. However, as the PPV is dependent on the prevalence, our study may have overestimated the PPV of ILI criteria over the entire duration of influenza season. Lastly, graft dysfunction, graft loss, rejection, and graft-versus-host-disease are all important endpoints in the transplant population and were not captured in this retrospective study.
