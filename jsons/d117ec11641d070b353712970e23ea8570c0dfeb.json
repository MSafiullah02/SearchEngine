            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has a profound impact on the host's immune system. Immunological imprinting by CMV is not restricted to immunity against CMV itself, but can affect immunity against other viral or non-viral infectious agents and also immunopathological responses. One category is heterologous immunity based on molecular mimicry, where antigen recognition receptors specific for a CMV antigen with broad avidity distribution also bind with some avidity to unrelated antigens and exert effector functions against target structures other than those linked to CMV. Another category is induction of cytokines by CMV infection that inhibit or drive immune responses to bystander antigens unrelated to CMV, and a third category is the activation of antigen-presenting cells by CMV from which unrelated antigens profit as \"stowaways\". A striking example of the \"stowaway\" category, actually one that is of medical importance, has been published recently and will be discussed here for the more general reader. Specifically, in a murine model, CMV airway infection and inhaled environmental antigen of poor intrinsic allergenic potential were found to sensitize for allergic airway disease (AAD) only when combined. As to the mechanism, viral activation of CD11b + conventional dendritic cells (CD11b + cDC) that localize to airway mucosa facilitates uptake and processing of inhaled antigen. Thus, CMV serves as a \"door opener\" for otherwise harmless environmental antigens that have no intrinsic property to activate DC. Antigen-laden CD11b + cDC migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they prime type-2 CD4 + T helper (Th-2) cells. Upon airway re-exposure to the inhaled antigen, Th-2 cells secrete interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25) known to induce goblet cell metaplasia, the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD that is characterized by thickening of airway epithelia and increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells, resulting in enhanced mucus secretion and airflow obstruction.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is not a textbook example of a respiratory viral infection. Nonetheless, hCMV infection has a respiratory phase that usually is not diagnosed because of its mild and unspecific symptoms in the immunocompetent host. So, it is subsumed under the popular term \"common cold\" that is used for symptoms of respiratory virus infections for which there is no medical indication to identify the cause and for which symptomatic treatment is sufficient, for instance infections with rhinoviruses, common coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses. Historically, CMVs were named \"salivary gland viruses\" ( [1, 2] , reviewed in [3, 4] ), as they replicate in acinar glandular epithelial cells of the salivary glands, from where they are released into the salivary duct [5, 6] . A frequent route of host-to-host transmission for primary infection is thus through saliva of a virus-shedding contact person, for instance in mother-to-child transmission. Transmission probability is increased whenever very young children crowd together, such as in multi-child families and in daycare centers. As an example of real life epidemiology for lectures on medicine, toy sharing, that is the mouthing of toys that other children have mouthed, has been identified as a way by which hCMV is transmitted between peers (reviewed in [7] , see also the contribution by Adler and Reddehase in this issue of MMIM [8] ).",

Clearly, allergic airway disease (AAD) elicited by inhaled environmental antigens is not the rule. The development of AAD requires a \"sensitization phase\", which, in immunological terminology, means \"priming\" of allergenspecific T cells, usually type-2 CD4 + T helper (Th-2) cells, as well as re-exposure to the allergen for a recall response. In their effector phase, restimulated allergen-specific Th-2 cells secrete cytokines that induce goblet cell (GC) metaplasia, such as the interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25 [12] [13] [14] . Remodeling of the airway mucosa by transdifferentiation of ciliated cells and Clara/Club cells to mucus-producing GC, rather than by proliferation of GC [15] , associated with thickening of airway epithelia and chronic mucus hypersecretion and consequent airflow obstruction, is the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD.",

This histopathology is referred to in the literature as GC hyperplasia or metaplasia, depending on whether one focuses on the increase in GC numbers [12] or on the remodeling of the mucosa by transdifferentiation of ciliated cells and Clara/Club cells to GC [15] , respectively. It should be noted that AAD was not induced when either OVA sensitization or OVA reexposure were missing. These controls verified the OVAspecificity of AAD.

Their activation is indicated by upregulation of CD28 ligands CD80 and CD86, and is associated with enhanced uptake of OVA. The OVA-laden CD11b + cDC then migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they present processed OVA peptides by MHC-II molecules to na\u00efve OVA peptide-specific Th-2 cells for priming. Upon re-exposure to inhaled OVA, restimulated OVA peptidespecific Th-2 cells secrete effector cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25, all known to be involved in the induction of GC metaplasia.",

Classical allergens and most pathogens have the intrinsic property to activate DC, whereas inhaled environmental protein antigens do not, and are thus ignored by the sentinels. This is a \"healthy ignorance\", as otherwise all environmental antigens would cause allergy. Activation of DC by CMVs is beneficial for priming a protective antiviral immune response, though it can result in allergic disease when used by otherwise harmless \"stowaways\" for entering DC. The findings suggests that by this \"door opener\" function, CMV airway infection may broaden the spectrum of potential allergens. Current experimental protocols did not lead to full-blown asthma.
