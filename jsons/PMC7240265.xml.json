The framework first establishes the idea that disasters are inherently a social phenomenon rooted in the social structure and reflects the processes of social change [1,2]. The core of such social structures and processes is the mechanism of collective action. We then explain the ways in which formal mathematical models in general, and game theoretical models in particular, can help analyze the dynamics of collective action, detect the core parameters through which they evolve and, in particular, identify the interactions between these parameters. We show that these dynamics may have different forms of development, which are usually non-linear and cyclic. The framework also emphasizes the major role of information and social learning in these dynamics.",

            "text": "In order to analyze cascading disasters systematically, we first need a definition of disaster that the research community can agree upon. Perry [2] discusses the various approaches to, and conceptualizations of, disasters as they have evolved since the 1950s. Early definitions suggest that disasters are sudden events that disrupt normal routines and social order, causing severe damage and loss of life [3]: 67 [4,5];: 310 [6];: 655 [7];: 357; [2]. Later definitions emphasize the hazards that characterize disasters, meaning that a disaster is viewed as an extreme event that arises when a hazard agent intersects with a social system [8]. In this approach, environmental hazard cycles and agents are the focus [1]: 347; [2]. This approach is close to the traditional geographers' view, which also defines disaster as \u201cthe interface between an extreme physical event and a vulnerable human population\u201d [9]: 264). While more recent definitions in the hazard approach retain the hazard origins of disasters, they have begun to examine them in social terms, particularly with regard to vulnerability and resilience [2,[10], [11], [12], [13]].",

It focuses on vulnerability as socially constructed and the idea of social change, all to the near exclusion of physical agents [1,2,14,15]. Therefore, this approach departs from the two discussed so far. In his definition of disasters Quarantelli (2000: 682) includes a variety of features. Disasters: (1) are sudden-onset events, (2) seriously disrupt the routines of collective units, (3) cause the adoption of unplanned courses of action to adjust to the disruption, (4) have unexpected life histories designated in social space and time, and (5) pose a danger to valued social objects. The entire concept is social: vulnerability is socially constructed by relationships in the social system and disasters are based on the notion of social change [16]: 226; [2].",

In a similar vein, [18]; 2005) views disaster as the collapse of cultural protections \u2013 captured in habits, folkways, laws, or policies \u2013 that either deflect or fail to deflect the threatening forces to which societies are exposed [2]. It follows that disasters flow from the normal functioning of social systems that take place when the life sustaining functions of the system break down [19]: 159). Therefore, researchers in that tradition see disasters as a subclass of a larger class \u2013 Barton called the larger type collective stress situations, while Boin, like Quarantelli and Rosenthal, uses the label crisis. In the current paper, we suggest collective action problems as the larger class.",

These are also vital dimensions and elements both in cascading disasters and in the dynamics of collective action. Hence, the significant added value we can get from integrating these three phenomena into one framework. Moreover, the crisis approach does not seek to identify specific factors that may cause a crisis, but, rather, proposes that escalating processes undermine a social system's capacity to cope with disturbances [20]: 27).

If, as a result of the hazardous materials spill, a neighborhood must be evacuated and a local stream is contaminated, these are also cascading events. Taken together, the effect of cascading events can be crippling to a community [23]. Indeed, the T\u014dhoku earthquake of 11 March 2011 is considered an outstanding example of a cascading disaster. It affected three prefectures in northeast Honshu, the main island of Japan. Although only about 100 people died as a direct result of the earthquake, about 18,000 were killed by the ensuing tsunami. The most enduring consequence of this event may be the radioactive contamination resulting from the damage the tsunami inflicted on the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear reactors which, in the short term, forced the evacuation of 200,000 people from the surrounding area [22]. Further effects of these events included damage to the global supply chain, severe environmental damage and a worldwide impact on attitudes and policies about nuclear energy.",

On the other hand, each phase in a cascading disaster where there is the potential of escalation may be regarded as a crisis. Therefore, a cascading disaster develops and escalates when local crisis situations in the chain are managed poorly, while the magnitude of the event intensifies as the chain develops and proceeds [24]. Viewing a cascading disaster as a chain or network of crisis situations means that the main characteristic that distinguishes cascading disasters from an isolated (\u201cregular\u201d) disaster is the accumulation of damage. Practically, it may be beneficial to analyze each phase in the chain or network in isolation where the impact of different nodes in the network may be regarded as inputs. Zuccaroa et al. [25] develop a network model with complex connections between the different nodes, yet they also propose an input-output model for analyzing each node in the network in isolation from the others. Indeed, network effects may inflict damage in a variety of areas in complex and non-linear ways. However, when planning a particular operating system or a strategy to cope with emergency or crisis situations, these effects can be considered inputs. Hence, each node or event in the chain may be analyzed in isolation from others. I will argue that in this kind of crisis situation, as in any isolated disaster, there are cascading effects but these occur at the social level and involve the development of a panic or the mobilization of efforts to deal with the crisis.",

One example is pollution that spreads disproportionally and in unexpected ways and creates cumulative damage. Another example is an epidemic or other social, technological, economic or political phenomena that spread and result in cumulative damage over time and space. Such dynamics usually develop like a snowball that gets bigger as it rolls downhill. The Covid-19 Pandemic is a good example of that type. Disaster and crisis research usually refers to these types of cascading disasters within the general category of disasters or cascading disasters. However, I suggest analyzing them in the context of collective action dynamics using continuous time models and information cascades. These tools are also effective for analyzing cascading effects at the societal level that occur within an isolated disaster or crisis.",

The collective outcome may also influence people who have not invested effort and want to free ride on the efforts of others. The literature explores a variety of ways through which people deal with such problems and mobilize (or dismantle) a collective action. Such dynamics characterize disaster and crisis situations, meaning that they can be understood in the general context of the collective action phenomenon.",

Another type of cascading disaster includes the disproportional spreading of a certain event through time and space, usually through a snowball dynamic.

The second type is characterized by the involvement of social activists who mobilize large numbers of people. While purely spontaneous collective action is rare, there are mechanisms that fit this characterization quite well. One such mechanism is the \u201cbandwagon\u201d effect, also termed the \u201cdomino\u201d or \u201csnowball\u201d effect, where individuals\u2019 decisions about whether or not to participate in a collective action are influenced by the number of people currently involved in those efforts. Assuming that individuals recognize the need to protest or exert effort to achieve a collective goal, it follows that a larger number of participants reduces the costs of action and increases the chances of success [[30], [31], [32]]. Opponents of the collective goals, such as the government in the case of mass protest, who observe a large-scale movement are less likely to take violent measures to counteract the movement but, rather, will tend to be sensitive to public demands. Similarly, when many people join the efforts to increase the readiness for a disaster, the costs that each one has to pay decline as the collective efforts increase. Thus, players join collective efforts when the number of participants reaches a certain subjective threshold, meaning that the probability of non-participants joining the collective effort is proportional to the number of participants. This creates a cumulative effect that may lead to mass mobilization.",

Other studies explain the ways in which social or institutional changes evolve through informational cascades [36,37] or belief cascades [38,39].

Since these conditions are only implicitly linked with individual preferences and beliefs, the model suggests that a given bandwagon effect can be explained and planned without knowing the exact preferences of the players. In other words, by aggregating individual beliefs and actions we are able to analyze the outcome of a certain bandwagon effect depending on a few structural variables rather than measuring individual beliefs and preferences in a given society.

According to this approach, when people watch other people participating in an action, they do not necessarily update their cost-benefit calculations or learn about the identity of others.

This approach is a general conceptual framework for analyzing information processing in any dynamic of collective action and hence cascading events. It can accurately, yet simply, describe complex mechanisms of information processing. At the same time, it is general enough to rationalize individual behavior in a wide variety of collective action dynamics. A good example are the processes of learning and information updating during the recent Covid-19 pandemic.

The literature on common knowledge presents several examples of the ways in which a fact that becomes common knowledge, meaning new information, influences behavior [46,48]. This reasoning is also the basis of Aumann's [45] seminal paper concerning the inability of rational players to \u201cagree to disagree\u201d about the probability of a given event.

Players who decide whether to join a collective action face a complex decision that includes several variables.

This state is composed of various structural parameters, external to the group, such as the natural and environmental conditions, government attitudes, the conflicts and coalitions in the political system, the international conditions, the socio-political situation, economic conditions, and other parameters that may be relevant to specific groups. Each player forms subjective beliefs concerning the state of the world that must exist before he/she decides to take action. These beliefs implicitly express the individuals\u2019 cost-benefit calculations as well as their attitudes toward risk. In comparison, in the threshold models the costs and benefits attached to collective action constantly change according to the observed number of participants. For example, consider two states of the world \u2013 State 1 and State 2 \u2013 that are identical in all aspects except one\u2014the attitudes of the government towards collective action, or towards the Covid-19 pandemic. State 1 represents a situation in which the government is flexible about collective action, or the pandemic, while in State 2 the government is determined to suppress mass collective action, or the pandemic. In such a case, a player who has all the information about the state of the world except the attitudes of the government cannot distinguish between State 1 and State 2.

When a player cannot accurately observe all of the components that comprise a specific state of the world, he/she cannot distinguish between several states of the world with respect to a certain component. The player's knowledge is formally described by a collection of mutually disjointed and exhaustive classes of states of the world. If two states of the world are in the same cell, the player who observes reality can tell which cell reflects this reality, but cannot distinguish the states that are in the same cell. Note also that the fewer the states of the world in each cell, the greater the player's information about reality.",

A cascading disaster in the form of a spreading event based on mobilization for collective action may develop through a bandwagon dynamic. It can be analyzed using the tools discussed here. Furthermore, using these tools we can also determine the available measures and actions needed to reduce the risk and damage of the disaster. For example, the rate and damage of a spreading epidemic is influenced by the natural characteristics of the disease and the efforts invested by many players to reduce its spread, perhaps by becoming immunized. The probability that joining the effort will prove effective increases as more people join in; hence the bandwagon rationale. At the same time, the natural characteristics of the disease function as forces that counteract the effort to reduce it. The interaction between these forces can be modeled using the continuous time model presented here. In a similar vein, other social, political and economic phenomena may develop through the bandwagon dynamic. Furthermore, we may utilize the common knowledge modeling approach to analyze such dynamics. Doing so will help us identify possible interventions that may influence the players' information about the state of the world as well as their learning processes.",

The common knowledge modeling discussed in this paper provides effective tools for analyzing such dynamics based on information accumulation and learning processes [44]. demonstrate the sudden eruption of a mass collective action or the sudden entry of a large number of participants after a public announcement triggers learning processes. Yet, this is only one case. By changing the partitions and/or the decision rules or increasing the possible states of the world, we can have similar phenomena but with different timings. This possibility underscores the role of leaders or the media in providing some basic information, which leads players to learn about the state of the world in which they operate. According to this argument, social leaders and the media do not convince people that they are in a bad situation nor do they always inform players about the preferences or expected actions of others.

In comparison, Kuran [33] argues that the sudden eruption of a collective action happens after preferences change but remain hidden. In many cases, people do not act because no one gives expression to the change in preference that has occurred.
