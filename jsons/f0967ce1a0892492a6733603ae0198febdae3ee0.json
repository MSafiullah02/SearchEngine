In countries such as Spain, the health care system has undergone a complete transformation of its organizational structure in a matter of weeks, to provide urgent care for COVID- Another lesson of this pandemic is that, from a scientific standpoint, not everything goes. The medical practice must always be grounded in the scientific method and respect the Hippocratic principle of \"primum non nocere\". Clinicians have been faced with resorting to treatments with little or no scientific evidence to back them up, often basing therapeutic decisions on \"in vitro\" studies or on small case series. For example, we have used lopinavir/ritonavir based on \"in-vitro\" studies with SARS [1], or we have generalized the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin based on 6 patients in an uncontrolled study [2] . Follow up studies have failed to identify a clear benefit of these drugs [3, 4] or revealed toxicity. The urgency of the pandemic has prompted a weakening of robust J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f publication criteria and peer review standards, leading to the publication of articles of questionable scientific and methodological value. Consequently, some scientific societies such as the European AIDS Clinical Society [5] or the Infectious Diseases Society of America [6] , have recently insisted on the need to circumscribe the use of untested drugs for SARS-CoV-2 in the context of clinical trials. When this health crisis is over, we must reflect on the need to achieve a balance between clinical urgency and due scientific process.",
