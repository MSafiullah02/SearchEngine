The Coronaviridae are a monogeneric family of pleomorphic, ether-labile, enveloped viruses. The virions have a diameter ranging from 60 to 220 nm and an average density in sucrose of 1.18 g/ml. They characteristically bear club-shaped surface projections about 20 nm in length from which the group derives its name (Latin corona, crown) [1]. The genomic RNA is an infectious single-stranded molecule which is capped and polyadenylated. The molecular weight is between 5 \u00d7 106 and 7 \u00d7 106, corresponding to about 15,000-20,000 nucleotides. There is no extensive sequence reiteration in the coronavirus genome. Coronavirions characteristically have three types of protein: a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein [mol.wt. (50-60) \u00d7 103], complexed with the genome as a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP); an N-glycosylated surface peplomer protein, associated with glycopolypeptides of (90-180) \u00d7 103 molecular weight, which is acylated and is responsible for virus attachment and cell-to-cell fusion (this protein may be removed by protease treatment); and a transmembrane matrix protein, associated with polypeptides of molecular weight (20-35) \u00d7 103 which have variable degrees of glycosylation. In the case of murine and bovine coronaviruses this polypeptide bears O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, and in the case of avian infectious bronchitis virus it bears N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides.",

            "text": "Most coronaviruses replicate in tissue culture within 12 h at 37\u00b0. Infection is often accompanied by cytopathic changes. There are conflicting reports as to whether a nuclear function is required for coronavirus replication. There are few data about the early events (adsorption, penetration, uncoating, etc.) involved in coronavirus replication. It is assumed that upon entering the cell the positive-stranded genome encodes protein(s) whose function is to replicate the genomic RNA and produce subgenomic mRNA. Recently, there have been reports of virus-specific RNA polymerases in coronavirus-infected cells, but the components of the enzyme have not been identified. Characteristic of coronavirus infection is the production of 3\u2032 coterminal subgenomic RNAs which form a nested set extending in a 5\u2032 direction. These RNAs are capped and polyadenylated. The replicative structures from which they are produced have not been characterized, but it has been demonstrated that the negative-stranded template from which murine hepatitis virus mRNAs are copied is of genome length. UV inactivation studies indicate that coronavirus mRNAs are not produced by the processing of a larger RNA, although extensive sequence homologies have been detected at the 5\u2032 ends of all murine hepatitis virus-specific subgenomic RNAs. For murine hepatitis virus, the mRNA function of each of the subgenomic viral RNAs has been demonstrated in vitro, and the mRNAs encoding each of the virion proteins, or its precursors, have been identified (fig. 1). Comparing the size of each mRNA with its translation product suggests that the expressed information lies within the 5\u2032 sequences of each RNA which are not found in the next smallest RNA. For murine hepatitis virus, glycosylation of the peplomer protein is initiated cotranslationally in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the transmembrane protein is glycosylated posttranslationally in the Golgi apparatus. The infectious bronchitis virus matrix protein is glycosylated on the nascent polypeptide. After synthesis, genomic RNA and virion proteins are assembled at the rough endoplasmic reticulum and virions bud into cisternae, acquiring their lipid membranes from the cell. The virions are subsequently transported to and accumulate in Golgi and smooth-walled vesicles. There is an absence of budding from the plasmalemma. The mechanism of virus release has not been characterized.",

            "text": "The relationships between some coronaviruses have been studied by molecular and immunological methods, but the data are fragmentary. Molecular hybridization indicates extensive sequence homology (about 70%) between murine hepatitis virus strains, in particular within the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein. This conclusion is supported by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic RNAs and chymotryptic peptide fingerprinting of nucleocapsid proteins. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the genomic RNA of a number of infectious bronchitis virus strains indicates greater sequence divergence both between and within serotypes of this species. Coronaviruses contain 3 major antigens which can be distinguished by antibodies against virion subcomponents. Each antigen corresponds to one of the three types of coronavirus protein. Immunological studies with monoclonal antibodies, antisera directed against subcomponents prepared from purified virions, and immune electron microscopy indicate that the antigenic sites responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies are associated with the surface peplomer polypeptide(s). Studies on the antigenic relationships of coronaviruses present a complex pattern. Relationships have been determined by a wide variety of tests, mainly using polyvalent sera from naturally infected or hyperimmunized animals. These immunological studies indicate that there are two antigenic groups of mammalian coronaviruses and two antigenic groups of avian coronaviruses. One recent porcine isolate does not appear to fall into either mammalian group. Many viruses remain to be classified.",

            "text": "The geographic distribution of many coronaviruses is known to extend over several continents and is probably worldwide. A seasonal incidence of infection occurs with some viruses, namely human coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Coronaviruses predominantly infect their natural vertebrate hosts. Biological vectors of coronaviruses have not been reported, and the natural hosts form the major reservoirs for further infection. In most cases, infection is by the fecal/oral route. Vertical intrauterine infection has been reported for infectious bronchitis virus and some murine hepatitis virus strains. Transmission from contaminated clothing and equipment is an important source of infection with infectious bronchitis virus and bovine coronavirus. Coronaviruses are associated with diseases of economic and clinical importance, predominantly respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. Feline infectious peritonitis virus is responsible for peritonitis in cats, and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and some murine hepatitis virus strains are associated with encephalomyelitis. Diagnosis of coronavirus infection is initially clinical, and confirmation is most readily achieved by virus isolation and propagation in vitro and/or by a variety of immunological procedures [2].",

After synthesis, genomic RNA and virion proteins are assembled at the rough endoplasmic reticulum and virions bud into cisternae, acquiring their lipid membranes from the cell. The virions are subsequently transported to and accumulate in Golgi and smooth-walled vesicles. There is an absence of budding from the plasmalemma. The mechanism of virus release has not been characterized.",

No difference between the genome RNA and mRNA 1 has yet been described. Each mRNA encodes only one protein, and the translation products of mRNAs 7, 6 and 3 have been identified as the intracellular precursors to the virion nucleocapsid, matrix and peplomer proteins, respectively. As the size of the translation product for each mRNA corresponds approximately to the coding potential of the 5\u2032 sequences which are absent from the next smallest mRNA, it seems likely that only these regions are translated into protein.",

Molecular hybridization indicates extensive sequence homology (about 70%) between murine hepatitis virus strains, in particular within the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein. This conclusion is supported by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic RNAs and chymotryptic peptide fingerprinting of nucleocapsid proteins. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the genomic RNA of a number of infectious bronchitis virus strains indicates greater sequence divergence both between and within serotypes of this species. Coronaviruses contain 3 major antigens which can be distinguished by antibodies against virion subcomponents. Each antigen corresponds to one of the three types of coronavirus protein. Immunological studies with monoclonal antibodies, antisera directed against subcomponents prepared from purified virions, and immune electron microscopy indicate that the antigenic sites responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies are associated with the surface peplomer polypeptide(s). Studies on the antigenic relationships of coronaviruses present a complex pattern. Relationships have been determined by a wide variety of tests, mainly using polyvalent sera from naturally infected or hyperimmunized animals. These immunological studies indicate that there are two antigenic groups of mammalian coronaviruses and two antigenic groups of avian coronaviruses. One recent porcine isolate does not appear to fall into either mammalian group. Many viruses remain to be classified.",

A seasonal incidence of infection occurs with some viruses, namely human coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Coronaviruses predominantly infect their natural vertebrate hosts. Biological vectors of coronaviruses have not been reported, and the natural hosts form the major reservoirs for further infection. In most cases, infection is by the fecal/oral route. Vertical intrauterine infection has been reported for infectious bronchitis virus and some murine hepatitis virus strains. Transmission from contaminated clothing and equipment is an important source of infection with infectious bronchitis virus and bovine coronavirus. Coronaviruses are associated with diseases of economic and clinical importance, predominantly respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. Feline infectious peritonitis virus is responsible for peritonitis in cats, and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and some murine hepatitis virus strains are associated with encephalomyelitis. Diagnosis of coronavirus infection is initially clinical, and confirmation is most readily achieved by virus isolation and propagation in vitro and/or by a variety of immunological procedures [2].",

No difference between the genome RNA and mRNA 1 has yet been described. Each mRNA encodes only one protein, and the translation products of mRNAs 7, 6 and 3 have been identified as the intracellular precursors to the virion nucleocapsid, matrix and peplomer proteins, respectively. As the size of the translation product for each mRNA corresponds approximately to the coding potential of the 5\u2032 sequences which are absent from the next smallest mRNA, it seems likely that only these regions are translated into protein.",
