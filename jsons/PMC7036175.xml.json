The landmark study of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) by Rivers et al. led to an era of liberal fluid administration [3], particularly as follow-on studies showed improved sepsis survival in hospitals that provided bundled sepsis care based on EGDT [4\u20136]. However, a growing body of observational literature [7\u201313] and several randomized trials (two in the developing world, one unblinded pilot trial in Europe) [14\u201316] evaluating the relationship between fluid administration and mortality suggest that large-volume fluid administration might be deleterious. These results are unable to guide current clinical management, as there is not a convincing control for confounding by indication in the observational studies, and several obstacles prevent generalization of the randomized trial results to sepsis patients in the developed world [17].",

We believe that a causal analysis of a large observational dataset could help to inform the debate around fluid resuscitation decisions in the meantime, as well as inform our interpretation of the findings from the CLOVERS trial when they arrive. To that end, we performed a retrospective cohort study of ICU patients with sepsis at a tertiary center and used causal inference techniques to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality outcomes that would result from imposing different limits on fluid volume administration (\u201ccaps\u201d) during the first 24 h of ICU care. We hypothesized that certain caps on fluid resuscitation would cause decreases in 30-day mortality (compared to current practice) for our patient population.",

The goal of causal inference generally is to emulate a hypothetical (and not necessarily practical) randomized controlled trial (RCT) using observational data [22]. The hypothetical RCT we sought to emulate in this study has many treatment arms. In one treatment arm of the RCT, physicians would be instructed to deliver \u201cusual care\u201d or \u201ccurrent practice,\u201d i.e., make no modification to the treatment decisions they would make when they are not participating in a RCT. Care followed the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [23] guidelines at the time. However, because these guidelines are not strict concerning fluid administration, there was a good deal of practice variability. Each other treatment arm would correspond to a different cut-off or cap on total fluid volume received by the end of the first 24 h after ICU admission. The caps range from 4 L to 12 L. Patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm would be treated according to usual care until they approached the arm\u2019s fluid volume cap, at which point they would be prevented from receiving any further fluids. (If a patient assigned to a fluid cap of 5 L, for example, would not exceed 5 L of fluids under usual care, then their treatment would not be altered by participation in the RCT.) \u201cBaseline\u201d for our hypothetical RCT is ICU admission, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the \u201cSample selection\u201d section. Our study estimates the 30-day mortality that would be observed in each arm of this hypothetical RCT.",

            "text": "We fit a dynamic Marginal Structural Model (dyn-MSM) to estimate our causal quantities of interest [24, 25]. We adjusted for confounding, i.e., accounted for the fact that patients who follow different treatment strategies tend to have different characteristics, by inverse probability of treatment weighting [25\u201327]. Here, we give a brief intuitive description of the method, which we describe in more technical detail in Additional file 1. Estimation of causal effects and quantification of uncertainty proceed in three steps.\nStep 1: Separately estimate mortality rate under each cap. To estimate the counterfactual mortality rate under a particular fluid resuscitation cap, we take the weighted average of mortality among patients whose fluid volumes were actually under the cap, weighting each patient appropriately so that they represent not only themselves but also all similar patients who exceeded the cap. Appropriate weighting requires a predictive model for the probability of remaining below the cap at each time given patient history of confounders up to that time. Each patient\u2019s weight is then the inverse of the product of these probabilities over all time steps. We used a boosted trees model to generate the probabilities [28].Step 2: Smooth the separate counterfactual mortality rate estimates. Having obtained separate estimates of counterfactual population mortality rates corresponding to a range of fluid volume caps, we next incorporate the assumption that mortality rate varies smoothly as a function of fluid volume cap. This allows us to \u201cborrow strength\u201d across estimates of mortality under different caps and improve the precision of our estimates for all caps. We specify that counterfactual mortality rate as a function of volume cap is described by a spline regression function. Details of estimation of the coefficients of the spline are left to Additional file 1. Given the spline coefficient estimates, we estimate counterfactual mortality under any volume cap by simply plugging the volume cap value into the spline function.Step 3: Quantifying uncertainty. We repeat steps 1 and 2 on 500 bootstrap samples of the data to obtain confidence intervals for the estimated effect of each cap. We obtain a simultaneous confidence interval over all caps in the range using the method from Appendix C of [29].",

We included both baseline and time-varying variables. Baseline variables were age, gender, ethnicity, weight, body mass index, service unit, Elixhauser comorbidities, and fluid volume administered prior to ICU admission. Time-varying variables included vital signs, lab values (platelets, creatinine, lactate), fluid volume administered in the previous hour, total fluid volume through the previous hour, urine output, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; both combined score and individual components), SOFA score (combined score and individual components), estimated 30-day mortality (based on a boosted trees predictive model fit to pre-treatment variables), and respiratory interventions (oxygen therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation). For each time-varying variable, we adjusted for its most recently measured value, time since it was last measured, its value the previous hour, and its running mean, maximum, and minimum.

All observational studies are vulnerable to confounding by indication. Our study was less susceptible to this bias than past observational studies on fluid administration for two reasons. First, the MIMIC dataset we used in our analysis contained granular temporal detail on a large number of clinical variables, which allowed us to adjust for more confounding variables than past studies. Second, exploiting the temporal detail of the MIMIC data, we employed causal inference methods that appropriately handled the time-varying nature of the problem. Even where prior retrospective studies attempt to control for patient-level variables using logistic regression [11, 12] or proportional hazard models [7\u201310], these methods only control for baseline confounders, not confounders that evolve as the illness course progresses in the ICU. For example, patients A and B with septic shock may have similar baseline characteristics, but at hour 12, patient A may have improved, while patient B may have worsened. This change in clinical condition affects the propensity of these patients to receive further fluids between hours 12 and 24 and is also clearly associated with mortality. By using the methods outlined above, we have accounted for such time-varying confounding. The fact that our study produces findings consistent with prior retrospective studies regarding fluid balance should encourage further interest in evaluating different fluid resuscitation strategies in RCTs. Pending evidence from RCTs, our study provides evidence from rigorous causal analysis of high resolution retrospective data that mortality is decreased when a fluid cap of 6-10 L is maintained, with the greatest reduction at around 8L. This is broadly consistent with resuscitation volumes from the other retrospective studies above that show relatively lower mortality.",

A helpful exercise is to compare the results of our analysis to what we would expect to see if we failed to adjust for important confounders. We would expect unobserved confounding to lead to monotonically decreasing estimated mortality rates as fluid volume caps decreased, since healthier patients tend to receive lower fluid volumes. Indeed, an unadjusted analysis estimates that 4 L fluid volume caps lead to a great reduction in mortality. However, Fig. 3 illustrates that our adjusted analysis estimated the highest mortality for the lowest fluid volume caps, which is an encouraging (though not definitive) sign that we successfully adjusted for confounding.",

            "text": "Other limitations to our study pertain to generalizability. First, this was a study of an ICU database at a single center and should be repeated with multicenter data. Second, to avoid bias, we had to exclude patients who violated any of our treatment strategies of interest (i.e., those who received over 4 L of fluid) before ICU admission. Our results are thus only applicable to the population of patients who arrive at the ICU without having already received large volumes of fluids. It is possible that effects of fluid caps would vary in the patients we omitted from our cohort. Third, we omitted patients with 0 L recorded pre-ICU fluid from our main analysis to guard against bias that might be induced by missing pre-ICU fluid data in this subpopulation. As a sensitivity analysis, we redid the analysis with these patients included and obtained qualitatively similar results (see Appendix E of Additional file 1). Fourth, we would ideally want to evaluate strategies governing treatment starting at sepsis onset, but because we only had detailed data beginning at ICU admission we focused on treatment decisions from that point onward. We mitigated this shortcoming by limiting our cohort to patients referred from the ED, which ensured that treatment had not begun too long before ICU admission for most patients in our sample. Finally, our data were collected from 2008 through 2012, and the effect of imposing fluid caps could have changed over time as fluid strategies have evolved.",

            "text": "We should also make the subtle point that our results are not necessarily estimates of the effects that would be observed if fluid caps were issued as guidelines. This is because we estimated the effect of abruptly cutting off fluids if physicians reached a (range of) threshold(s) after following usual care. If a guideline informed physicians of a fluid cap ahead of time, they may alter their treatment strategies in advance of reaching the cap in myriad ways (e.g., start vasopressors earlier, deliver lower volume boluses from time of admission, deliver less frequent boluses from time of admission, and administer maintenance fluid at a slower rate). If the distribution of treatment strategies in a world with a new guideline did not resemble the distribution of treatment strategies among patients whose care happened to be in accordance with that guideline in our data, then our results might not be good estimates of the outcomes that would be observed under the guideline. Thus, while our results are certainly evidence of benefit from fluid restrictive strategies, they do not point directly to specific guidelines.",
