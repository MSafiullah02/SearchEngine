The nucleophile of \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolases is located at the turn, known as the \u201cnucleophile elbow\u201d, and is identified by the sequence motif Sm\u2013X\u2013Nuc\u2013X\u2013Sm (Sm, small residue; X, any residue; Nuc, nucleophile) [3].

Fig. 1 shows the catalytic triad that includes residues His57, Asp102 and Ser195. In addition to the base His57 and the nucleophile Ser195, the localization of Ser54, Ala55, and Cys58 of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern is shown, as well as amino acids of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern: Gly193-Asp194-Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 and two main-chain nitrogens: N/Gly193 and N/Ser195, which are the canonical oxyanions OxyI and OxyII [11]. In trypsin, there are two amino acids that interact with both the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern and the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern. The amino acids Gly43 and Val213 are in contact with the tripeptide Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 (Fig. 2A, Table 1\n). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 form a hydrogen bond with Ser195: N/Gly43-O/Ser195, and a weak hydrogen bond with Gly196: O/Gly43-CA/Gly196. Similar to Gly43, main-chain atoms of Val213 form two hydrogen bonds with the dipeptide Gly196-Gly197 (N/Val213-O/Gly197 and O/Val213-N/Gly196); the tetrapeptide Asp194-Gly197 forms a \u03b2-turn (data not shown). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 and Val213 are also in contact with the dipeptide Ser54-Ala55 from the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern: contacts O/Gly43-OG/Ser54 and O/Val213-CB/Ala55 are shown (Fig. 2A). The group of connected amino acids presented in Fig. 2A we have named the 43/213 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (43/213-NBCZone) of trypsin.",

In this work, for each protease, we will use both the original numbering of the amino acid sequence and the canonical numbering of the amino acid sequence of trypsin which is shown by the index \u201cT\u201d. The 67 eukaryotic structures have either serine or threonine at position 54T, and alanine at position 55T. Therefore, the set of these 67 proteins was named the \u201c[ST]A group\u201d (Table S1).",

In contrast, with the bovine protein C as an example, replacing this alanine with a hydrophobic valine does not cause major changes in the conformation of the catalytic histidine [17].",

Glycines at position 196T and 197T are also invariant. The same can be said about 42T-58T disulfide bond with the exception of four proteins: C1r, C1s, MASP-2 and MASP-3 (Table S1). C1r/C1s and MASP-1/-2/-3 form a family of mosaic serine proteases with identical domain organization [18], functioning as supramolecular complexes [19]. In each of the five mosaic serine proteases, two loops structurally corresponding to trypsin loop A (34T-41T) and loop B (56T-64T) [20] contact each other during the formation of such complexes [[21], [22], [23]]. In trypsin, cysteine at position 42T is located at the carboxy-terminal end of loop A, and cysteine at position 58T is placed at the amino-terminal end of loop B. Perhaps because of the need to form the supramolecular complexes, disulfide bonds are missing in all but MASP-1. As the analysis of the MASP-2 structure (PDB ID: 3TVJ, [22]) shows, despite the absence of a disulfide bond, contacts between amino acids at positions 42T, 58T and the catalytic nucleophile are conserved (Table 1). This indicates the existence of the NBCZones in these four proteins. In MASP-1 (PDB ID: 3GOV, [24]), unlike the other family members, there is a Cys475(42T)-Cys491(58T) disulfide bond. In addition, this protease has a very long loop B (Ala488-Asp513), compared with the corresponding loops in other proteases of this family [24]. It is possible that the structural and functional features of loop B, together with loop A and the amino acids adjacent to them, determine the presence of the Cys475(42T)-Cys491(58T) disulfide bond in MASP-1.",

Because in the TN group the 55T position is occupied by an asparagine and not by an alanine like in the [ST]A group, the 55T-213T interaction (Fig. 2A) is modified such that instead of the CB atom of alanine, the main chain oxygen of amino acid at position 213T interacts with the ND2 atom of asparagine (e.g. ND2/Asn196\u2013O/Asn321 in human mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2) (PDB ID: 5M3N, [27]; Table 1, Fig. 2C).",

The structural diversity of the side chain of Asn55T agrees well with the conformational changes in the active sites of the HtrA family proteases [[25], [26], [27],29].",

The alignment of the primary structures of such proteases, given in the work of Kanitz et al. [47], shows that the number of dyad proteases with the dipeptide Ile-Gln at positions 54T and 55T is approximately equal to the number of dyad proteases with the dipeptide Cys-Pro [47]. Table 1 lists the structural parameters of the 3Cl protease from Alphamesonivirus 1 with the participation of the dipeptide Ile-Gln in the active site (PDB ID: 5LAC, [47]). Gln46, located in position 55T, is the largest amino acid of all structurally similar amino acids listed in Table S1. Therefore, despite the large size of Ile45 located at position 54T, Ile45 required a water molecule HOH537 to contact with Arg35 (position 43T) (Table 1). The existence of water HOH537 correlates with the presence of two leucine residues at positions 42T and 58T, as it was shown earlier for the nuclear inclusion protein A. It is possible that the presence of a water molecule (Table S1, column 7) in the 2A proteinase from the 43&[VR]N group is also associated with the existence of leucine at position 58T and structural specificity of 43&[VR]N group. The connection between the structural specificity of a group and the presence of a water molecule is also supported by the existence of a similar water molecule in immunoglobulin A1 protease (43&[STG][AV] group), which was described earlier. However, the structural reasons for the presence of the water near the residues at positions 54T and 43T in these six proteins are not entirely clear. It can only be assumed that the replacement of a direct contact of amino acids at positions 54T and 43T with water-mediated contacts demonstrates a weakening of the interaction of the nucleophilic loop with a \u03b2-sheet containing the catalytic base and the catalytic acid. This weakening is somehow related to the functional characteristics of these six proteins. In conclusion, we note that the presence of water molecules in a similar place in (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases has not been previously established.",

However, in this protein, the catalytic serine 195T is also replaced by glycine (Gly353). Perhaps for this reason, the CE1 atom of the catalytic histidine 57T (His200) forms the contact O/Val374-CE1/His200 = 3.5 (2.4) \u00c5. According to the canonical rule of the Derewenda et al.

An additional visual inspection of the trypsin tertiary structure showed that near the nucleophile-oxyanion loop Gly193-Gly197 there are two water molecules HOH1015 (position X) and HOH1003 (position Y) that form two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen atoms of Gly193 and Asp194, and two weak hydrogen bonds with the C\u03b1-atoms of Asp194 and Gly197 (Fig. 3C, Table 2\n). Water molecules HOH1015 and HOH1003 are located at a distance comparable to the distance of a hydrogen bond. This conformation of the nucleophile-oxyanion loop corresponds to the zyme type trypsin conformation. The contacts HOH1015-O/Gly193 and HOH1015-CA/Asp194 dispose the N/Asp194 atom to the position required for the formation of an important \u03b2-turn contact (O/Cys191-N/Asp194; not shown). The contacts HOH1003-O/Asp194 and HOH1003-CA/Gly197 are important for the correct orientation of the nucleophile Ser195 and its N(OxyII) oxyanion atom. Consequently, HOH1015 and HOH1003 do not affect the position of the N(OxyI) oxyanion atom. In trypsin, the nitrogen atom N/Gly193 is located at the position (type II \u03b2-turn) that ensures the activity of this protease [10]. However, in other proteases with the same zyme pattern contacts, as shown in Fig. 3C, nitrogen N(OxyI) may not be appropriate for the activity of the protein (type I \u03b2-turn; see below). Therefore, the zyme structural organization is necessary, but it is not sufficient to conclude whether the particular tertiary structure corresponds to the active or inactive state of the protease.",

Given the conservative changes in amino acids at positions 43T, 55T, and 194T and the absence of the disulfide bond 42T-58T, it seems that proteases of the TN group do not have the ability to undergo a structural transition of the zymogen-zyme type.

As a result, the contact of the side-chain atom of the amino acid at position 43T with the main-chain oxygen of amino acid at position 193T is absent (Thr25 and Gly153, respectively, in the serine protease SplE). Earlier, we stated that, apparently, only members of eukaryotic and prokaryotic [ST]A groups can demonstrate two alternative conformations of the NBCZone extension pattern: zyme and zymogen. The NBCZone extension pattern of SplE shows that, sometimes, neither zyme nor zymogen form is possible. Instead a third form is formed, which is an atypical variant. Therefore, the letter A (Atypical) is added to the number of the structures of this protease and to the numbers of all similar structures in Table S1.

In all these five proteins, instead of glycine in position 197T there is serine, threonine, or aspartate amino acid. The presence of any residue other than glycine at position 197T leads to a structural change in which a water molecule is replaced by the atom(s) of the side chain of the amino acid of residue 197T. Fig. 3F shows an example of a zyme contact pattern for such a protein: Heparin binding protein (PDB ID: 1A7S, [75]) has Thr177 at a position equivalent to position 197T in trypsin (Table 2). The CB and CG2 atoms of the side chain of Thr177 have the same structural role in this protein as the water molecule HOH1003 in the structure of trypsin (see Fig. 3C). In position 43T there is Gly27. Therefore, a water molecule HOH451 is located at the X position. The other four eukaryotic proteins also have water molecule at position X because they have glycine at position 43T (Table S2).",

As a result, one water molecule is located at position X and another at Y.2)Eukaryotic zymogen type proteases place the side-chain oxygen of Asp194T at position X and water molecule at position Y.3)In almost all prokaryotic and viral proteases, the amino acid at position 43T is not glycine.
