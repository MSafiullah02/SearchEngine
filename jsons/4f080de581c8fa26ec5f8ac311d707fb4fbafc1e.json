            "text": "himself constantly worrying about his physical symptoms and is concerned that his problem has been misdiagnosed because he has not described his symptoms properly to the doctors. A year prior to attending our clinic, one of Anthony's close friends was diagnosed with angina and put on medication. Despite being very concerned about this friend, Anthony has avoided seeing him. When he does see him, he does not talk about the heart disease. He is terrified that his friend might describe symptoms similar to his own. Anthony also never discusses his fears about his health with friends or family for fear of being told of other people who have been misdiagnosed or died of heart attacks. When he hears stories about heart disease on the news, he always turns off the program immediately. He avoids reading the obituaries in the newspaper so he will not read about anyone dying of a heart attack (with a request for charitable donations to the Heart Foundation). Anthony is exercising less although he is very aware that exercise is very important for heart health. He fears that he will be like the ultra-healthy marathon runner who dies unexpectedly from undiagnosed heart disease. Anthony's health anxiety resulted in social isolation and avoidance of health-maintaining behaviors. As is typical, this avoidance gradually spread over time and impeded his life more and more. He came for treatment because he wanted to be able to exercise again without becoming terribly anxious.",

Exposure is widely used in the treatment of the various anxiety disorders and has been demonstrated to be a critical treatment component. Griest, Marks, Berlin, Gournay, and Noshirvani (1980) , for example, describe an interesting study looking at the impact of telling clients not to expose themselves to feared situations. The 17 participants (5 with agoraphobia, 2 with social phobia, 4 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 6 with specific phobias) were given two sets of instructions in counter-balanced order. For one week they were told to engage in regular exposure to feared stimuli and for the other week they were instructed to avoid feared stimuli as much as possible. Results clearly indicated that the exposure treatment was beneficial and that when individuals were in the avoidance condition, their presenting problems worsened. Telch, Agras, Taylor, Roth, and Gallen (1985) reported similar findings in a randomized trial of imipramine plus exposure compared to imipramine with avoidance instructions for treatment of EXPOSURE agoraphobia. The authors reported that the individuals in the exposure (plus imipramine) condition did well, whereas those in the avoidance condition showed no improvement at all, despite the imipramine.",

Generally, repeated practice is required before the individual is able to face difficult situations with relative ease. Our clinical experience suggests that initiating exposure early in treatment of health anxiety may be particularly beneficial. Most individuals prefer a graduated exposure strategy, with early tasks being ones that create only modest anxiety and then gradually increasing the difficulty of the practice exercises. Initially, practice is focused on two to four situations. We encourage clients to select targets that are important and relevant to them. If a goal for exposure seems too complex or too difficult to tackle all at once, the goal can be broken down into smaller steps. We emphasize the importance of repeated practice of each exposure task. It is important for the client to experience early successes and mastery in anxiety-arousing situations. Starting with easier assignments will allow the individual to build self-confidence and confidence in the exposure technique. This facilitates later work on more challenging situations.",

Many of these situations can be tackled through in vivo exposure such as watching medical documentaries or dramas on television, reading accounts of people who are seriously ill, visiting health care facilities, and going for regular check-ups. Some external trigger situations may be associated with difficult memories, such as the hospital where the client received a painful treatment, or the place where a family member died. Exposure to these situations is often emotionally difficult but may help clients progress to the point where they can calmly visit a place associated with sad memories. We point out that all of us will have to visit friends and family in medical facilities and even use them ourselves at times. Using exposure so that we can visit these places without excessive distress has great advantages for future functioning. Handout 8.1 provides information for clients about in vivo exposure to external triggers.

His doctor has informed him that the problem with chest pain is related to stress and anxiety. Anthony identified three principal areas of avoidance (a) talking about heart disease, especially with his friend who has angina; (b) watching TV programs and reading information about heart disease; and (c) exercise. Anthony chose to first tackle the goal of returning to a regular exercise routine. Anthony had always been fit and he used to jog regularly several times per week and go to the gym twice a week to lift weights. As his worries about his chest pain increased, he had gradually stopped these activities. Anthony's goal of returning to regular exercise was broken down into the following steps:",

He developed an exercise routine with the staff at his gym that involved jogging, weights, and sessions on the elliptical trainer. Anthony still experienced some chest pain and panicked at times when he felt short of breath while exercising. He learned to stay in the exercise situation to allow the symptoms to settle, rather than halting his exercise session. Because of this, he progressed through the first three steps towards his exposure goal quite slowly, spending several weeks on each one. The turning point for Anthony seemed to be when he was able to attempt brief runs.

Anthony was only moderately anxious about this virus so it served as an excellent exposure situation. News coverage of this virus was extensive, and it was a good opportunity to learn ways of coping with medical information in the media and in the community.

A person may notice a symptom (e.g., back pain) and may then be upset by the thought, \"What if I have bone cancer?\" The initial thought is often followed by thoughts and images of the suffering and disability that may accompany cancer, unpleasant treatments, and finally death. A very effective strategy is to have individuals develop detailed narratives, or illness stories, about their worst fears related to illness and death. We provide examples to show the client how to write a vivid and detailed account describing the troubling symptoms, the worries and doubts associated with the symptom, and the feared catastrophic results. During imaginal exposure the client repeatedly reads the story and uses it as a cue to vividly imagine the experiences. We explain that it is not the activity of reading that produces the exposure experience, but, rather, the use of the story to stimulate the imagination. In some cases, imaginal exposure initially triggers unpleasant physical symptoms (e.g., nausea or tightness in the chest) and this is helpful as a form of interoceptive exposure.",

The first strategy is perhaps the most obvious one: have the client engage repeatedly in an activity that has been avoided because it creates uncomfortable sensations. If a person is avoiding walking outside during the hot summer because the feeling of being too hot makes him uncomfortable, a homework assignment could be to go for daily walks outdoors (with a water bottle). Similarly, if a person has stopped going to dances because she feels uncomfortable when her heart pounds and she feels breathless, the obvious prescription is to go to dances every Saturday and dance energetically. A related approach is to watch for the bodily sensations to occur in everyday life (e.g., pain) and then focus on the sensation to see if it can be made more intense and if attention can be focused on the symptom for a significant time (30 minutes perhaps). The goal is not to focus on the unpleasant symptom for hours at a time, but rather to have repeated periods of exposure where the client focuses on the symptom rather than trying to focus attention elsewhere, in order to allow for extinction of the emotional response to the bodily sensation.",

            "text": "A second strategy for exposure to bodily sensations is interoceptive exposure, which has been used very effectively in the treatment of panic disorder (Craske & Barlow, 2001; Schmidt et al., 2000) . This strategy involves deliberately producing the feared bodily sensations, focusing attention on them without trying to bring them to an end, and trying to maintain the sensations for a number of minutes as part of exposure practice. Common strategies for producing uncomfortable bodily sensations are outlined in Table 8 .2. Many clients find this to be an intimidating exercise and they are more likely to use these techniques at home if they are first experienced in a therapy session. As with all exposure techniques, it is critical that interoceptive exposure be repeated until the individual is no longer distressed by the bodily sensation. We remind clients that they will experience anxiety at first when they engage in these activities but, as they continue to practice, their ability to face more intense bodily sensations and to cope with feelings of fear and discomfort will increase. Some of the body symptoms that trigger health worries may be difficult or impossible to produce voluntarily (e.g., lumps, skin rashes, headaches, and abdominal pains). Imaginal exposure is very useful here. We have clients write narratives about their feared bodily symptoms using the same approach as for the illness stories. The client describes in vivid terms the feared symptom, the worries and doubts associated with this symptom, and the feared catastrophic results. The imaginal exposure involves reading the story repeatedly to stimulate imagery of the situation for 30 min or more. The exposure practice must be done repeatedly over days and weeks until the anxiety is reduced substantially. An example which may be used with clients is provided in Handout 8.3.",

Clients may need to work on practicing exposure to healthrelated situations without carrying their medication, water bottle, cell phone or other anxiety-reducing device. It is important for the clinician to review the use of safety behaviors occasionally through the course of treatment and to help the client gradually eliminate the use of excessive safety behaviors. As is the case with checking and reassurance seeking, it is important to establish what is realistic and appropriate (e.g., having a first aid kit in the home and car) and what is not (e.g., staying within a certain distance of a hospital or doctor's office). CONCLUSION For many clients, avoidance is a core feature of their health anxiety. Exposure to bodily symptoms and themes of illness and death is, therefore, critical for treatment success. In vivo, imaginal, and interoceptive exposure can all be helpful techniques, depending on the nature of the avoided stimuli. We encourage gradual and repeated exposure to feared health-related situations. Our experience has been that introducing these strategies early in treatment can result in substantial reductions of avoidance and anxiety.",
