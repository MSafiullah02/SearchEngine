There have been extensive research performed on SARS, however, the understanding of pathophysiology impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is still limited. In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19. By comparing these two diseases, we found, COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases were emerged in COVID-19. Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed, the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, otherwise the number of CD4+ and CD8+T cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. Based on these early observations, as pediatrician, we put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and give some recommendations to contain the disease.",

In this paper, we summarized the difference and similarities between children's SARS and children's CVOID-19 from epidemiology to clinical characteristics, at the same time, we provide some suggestions on containing children's COVID-19. On the one hand, we hope to draw upon the experience of containing SARS to mitigate the epidemic. On the other hand, we hope our suggestions could help other countries to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Introduction A cluster of pneumonia patients caused by unknown pathogen which were linked to the seafood wholesale market presented in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Subsequently, a new coronavirus was identified by sequencing the whole genome of patient samples (Zhu et al., 2020). It was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2020), and the disease caused by the virus was named Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO). Of 7 coronaviruses identified from human, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are belong to \u03b1-coronaviruses\uff0cHCoV-OC43\u3001MERS-CoV\u3001SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are belong to \u03b2-coronaviruses. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were firstly emerged in China. Although the genome-wide similarity was only about 79%, the similarity of the seven conserved domains used for virus identification was as high as 94.6%. It indicates that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same genus as SARS-CoV. Additionally, studies showed SARS-CoV-2 could enter cells through Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor on the surface of cell membrane, which was consistent with SARS-CoV (Lu R et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). 84,338 confirmed cases including 4642 deaths were reported in China by 25 April. this stage. SARS-CoV-2 as a new virus, the biological characteristics, epidemiology, pathogenicity and immunity are not illustrated; efficient, fast and accurate detection methods are still lacking; specific drugs and vaccines were still investigational.",

The most cases were concentrated in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, Canada (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020). In contrast, by 25, April, over 80,000 confirmed cases and over 4,000 deaths were reported within a matter of 4 months in China. Additionally, 213 countries with more than 2,700,000 confirmed cases and at least 180,000 deaths were reported. The notably increased number indicated COVID-19 had stronger infectivity. The children with SARS were sporadic and had a clear history of exposure. By contrast, the children with COVID-19 showed clear history of clustering in infected households and community spread. According to incomplete statistics, over 230 children were infected with COVID-19, of 26.8% (69/257) have a history of exposure to Hubei province, 71.2% (183/257) had a clear history of clustering in infected households (Chan et al., 2020). In the aspect of spreading approaches, both SARS and COVID-19 patients can be transmitted through droplets and contact. Insufficient evidences showed the newborn acquire the SARS or COVID-19 infection through vertical transmission (Chen H et al., 2020; Zhu et al., Xia; Pak C. Ng, 2004).On the other hand, studies suggested SARS may transmitted through aerosols containing viruses (Yu et.al, 2004) and digestive tract (Chinese academy of pediatrics respiratory group, 2003), but it's still unclear can be transmitted through these ways. Fecal-oral tract way should not be ignored because studies had showed the positive nucleic acid tests in the feces (Guan et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020)even though no case was reported being transmitted through the digestive tract.",

(3) The asymptomatic children were overlooked. (4) Children with normal pulmonary image were ignored.(5)The false negative result of nucleic acid detection. Why children infected with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms? Why they have none/mild abnormal biochemical indicators and pulmonary image change? The potential reasons are as following: (1) Children has a variety of memory T cells specific to the virus for frequently exposed to a variety of viruses in childhood, and it may has cross-react after SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. (2) Vaccination helps the body form a protective immune response. (3) The immune system of children is still developing, and an inadequate immune defense can prevent excessive host immune damage. As a group of pediatrician, we learn from SARS and suggest: (1) The possible strategic approaches should be used to diagnose children with COVID-19. (3) Isolation measures is mandatory taken in time to the perinatal pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and multidisciplinary service team should be involved to improve the survival rate of newborns. (4)The following warning risk factors of severe cases should be identified early: younger age, higher percentage of neutrophils, higher LDH, decreased CD4+, CD8+T cells and progressive pulmonary image. (5) Considering mild clinical symptoms, imaging examination should not be ignored on children with COVID-19, chest CT can be used to improve the positive rate before the nucleic acid result, especially for those cases whose chest X-radiograph is normal. (6) The method of specimen collection for nucleic acid test should be trained, lower respiratory specimens were advocated to improve the positive rate. (7) The widely administrate of hormones should be cautious. (8) The education about how to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should be advocated. (9) More clinical and basic researches is necessary to understand COVID-19. (10)A lager and polycentric clinical database should be built to analysis the children infected with COVID-19. Recent study found that anxiety, depression and stress are common in young people during COVID-19 epidemic (Wang et al., 2020), further research is required to study mental health of young children infected with COVID-19.",
