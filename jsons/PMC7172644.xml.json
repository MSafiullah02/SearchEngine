Several respiratory syndromes were described in adults. The etiologic agents associated with these syndromes included coryza caused by rhinovirus, echovirus 28, and coxsackievirus A21; pharyngeal conjunctival syndrome caused by adenovirus; and pneumonia caused by influenza virus, para-influenza virus, adenovirus, and coxsackievirus.1\n",

Croup syndromes were associated with parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenoviruses, and influenza viruses. Bronchopneumonia was most likely caused by RSV, but it may also have been caused by parainfluenza viruses (particularly parainfluenza type 3), adenoviruses, influenza viruses, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A syndrome that the investigators called \"bronchiolitic bronchopneumonia\" was predominantly associated with RSV or parainfluenza type 3 infection. Severe bronchitis and pharyngitis were associated with RSV, adenoviruses, the parainfluenza viruses, and influenza viruses. Outpatient rhinitis, pharyngitis, and bronchiolitis were associated with the same agents that caused bronchiolitic bronchopneumonia.",

Parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2 alternated every other year; parainfluenza type 3 and RSV caused outbreaks of disease every winter. Approximately 40% to 50% of patients with croup yielded one of the parainfluenza viruses. Reinfections with RSV were common and caused less severe respiratory illness. Passively acquired maternal antibodies appeared to provide some protection for neonates. Nosocomial RSV infections were common in hospitalized children. Studies in Newcastle upon Tyne indicate that death rates in children with bronchiolitis were about 1% with RSV or parainfluenza pneumonia but approached 4% to 5% in infants with congenital heart disease. It was estimated that annually in the United States approximately 30,000 children were hospitalized with croup and an additional 12,000 children were hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia.12\n",

Rather, the most successful route of viral spread is by the transmission of infectious mucosal secretions to the fingers and hands, and subsequently to the nose or eyes of a susceptible recipient.15 The simple act of timely hand washing may be the most effective method of breaking the chain of transmission and thereby interrupting virus spread.21, 22, 23\n",

These factors include young age, low birth weight, prematurity, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, some congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disorders, malnutrition (especially with vitamin A deficiency), crowding, the number of children residing in the household, the presence of large numbers of susceptible people in the community, lack of breast-feeding, and exposure of the susceptible child to other infected persons.

However, specific prevention and effective treatments remain elusive. Still, many treatments of viral respiratory diseases are homeopathic or supportive. The authors of the following articles expand on these observations. They offer new information on improved methods that provide for the prevention and treatment of these exceedingly prevalent pediatric respiratory disorders.",
