The pivotal study arguing that NIMV poses high risk of infection spread is based on the assessment of particle dispersion using an experimental model [4]. Smoke was introduced into the lungs of a mannequin while noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was being used. Plumes of smoke emerging from the vented mask were photographed for particle dispersion. So far no study has been conducted to evaluate particle dispersion on humans. Whether a mannequin simulates a live patient using NIMV has been greatly debated, and many argue that the NIMV mask may in fact offer protection from secretions that would have otherwise been dispersed from the infected patient during coughing, sneezing, and speaking. Also, there are no comparative data on particle dispersion between individuals undergoing NIMV and those who do not.\n",

It also evaluated the infection risk among HCWs who had direct contact with patients on NIMV [5]. In all, 22 patients (25 %) needed NIMV and 155 HCWs (including doctors, nurses, and health-care assistants) exposed to patients on NIMV therapy were regularly screened for signs of infection. Coronavirus serology was obtained for 97 % of HCWs. NIMV equipped with expiratory bacterial and viral filters was provided in isolated cubicles in the ward or in the ICU, which were centrally air-conditioned and fitted with exhaust ventilation fans to achieve negative-pressure flow. The study concluded that NIMV was not only effective in preventing IMV in 70 % of patients with acute respiratory failure due to SARS but it effectively reduced the ICU length of stay or avoided ICU admission altogether. Moreover, no infection was noted in any of the 155 HCWs, and their serology tests for coronavirus were negative.",
