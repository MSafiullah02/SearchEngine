Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot techniques, both of which detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), are serologic tests that can confirm the diagnosis. In Lyme disease, IgM peaks approximately 4 weeks and IgG approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of ELISA as the initial screening test, and confirmation with the Western blot if the ELISA is positive (due to cross reactivity on ELISA of Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], parvovirus, syphilis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).5 PCR may also be used to amplify DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi in blood, CSF fluid, and synovial fluid. Other laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and complement factors (C3/C4), may help to support the diagnosis of Lyme disease. The differential diagnosis of Lyme disease can be found in Table 71-3\n.",

Cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease require hospitalization of the child, intravenous antibiotics, and cardiology consultation. Oligoarthritis associated with Lyme disease should be confirmed by either serologic or PCR analysis and treated with oral antibiotics for 28 days.

Cytotoxins cause destruction of the lining of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in bloody diarrhea with leukocytes, and may invade lymphatic tissue, causing systemic symptoms (Table 71-5\n). An infectious etiology not caused by either an enterotoxin or cytotoxin is Clostridium botulinum. Symptoms include descending weakness and paralysis within 4 days of the ingestion of contaminated canned foods, such as mushrooms, smoked fish, or vegetables.

Stool analysis for ova and parasites should be considered in cases of prolonged incubation or duration of symptoms. Some infectious causes, such as Yersinia, may mimic appendicitis, and therefore radiologic studies may be required to rule out an acute abdomen. In pediatric patients, two potential complications that should be looked for are Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (associated with Campylobacter infection) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7) (see Chapter 47, Peripheral and Neuromuscular Disorders; and Chapter 88, Renal Disorders).13\n",

Rare complications of EBV infections include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, myocarditis, myositis, glomerulonephritis, encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and cranial nerve palsies (Table 71-7\n). Spontaneous splenic rupture occurs in 1% to 2% of cases of infectious mononucleosis.
