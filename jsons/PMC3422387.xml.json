It has been described in all age groups, especially in the paediatric-adolescent population. Management usually consists of immunosuppressive agents along with treatment of the underlying condition. The HLH 2004 protocol consists of repeated cycles of cyclosporine- etoposide- dexamethasone; however, sustained responses are rare, especially in familial HLH, and most patients eventually relapse [1]. Bone marrow transplant remains the only effective therapy for refractory cases but entails high procedure related mortality.",

The diagnosis of familial HLH is often based on the age of onset, family history including a history of consanguinity, the clinical profile and/or co-existence of inherited immune deficiencies. Frequent relapses are common and these patients are usually candidates for BMT [4]. However, differentiation from early onset acquired HLH can be difficult. Absence of markers of immune deficiency (CHS, GS or XLP) or genetic perforin-granyzyme mutations does not rule out familial HLH.",

[5]. Both familial and secondary HLH are usually precipitated by an immunological trigger which may be an infectious agent or a drug. Among the infectious agents viruses especially Ebstein-Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus (virus associated HLH) are most commonly implicated, but bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections have also been described [6, 7]. With the possible exception of visceral leishmaniasis, immunomodulation is indicated in most cases [8]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been related to haemophagocytic syndrome in case reports from the Indian subcontinent, often with high mortality despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [1, 9\u201311]. We report a case of haemophagocytic syndrome related to mycobacterial infection which was managed with steroids and IVIG with complete clinical and haematological response.",

She was managed with broad spectrum antibiotics, hydration and other supportive measures. High grade fever persisted along with progressive hepatosplenomegaly; on the 10th day of admission she developed ascites, respiratory distress and bilateral ptosis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Peripheral blood counts revealed anaemia (7.6 gm/dl) and thrombocytopenia (87 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl). Leucopenia (total leucocyte count 2.4 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl, absolute neutrophil count 1.1 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) developed 4\u20135 days later. The coagulation profile was deranged with prolonged PT (32 s, INR 3.02) and APTT (39 s) in the absence of overt bleeding. D-dimer was positive. Serum triglycerides were 457 mg/dl, serum ferritin was 1,331 ng/ml and LDH was 1,889 IU/l. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed prominence of macrophages and histiocytes and phagocytosis of mature myeloid and lymphoid elements (Fig. 1). In addition, ELISA (IgM) for M tuberculosis was unequivocally positive at 1.08 U/ml (normal < 0.90 U/ml) while IgG (0.18 U/ml, normal < 0.90) and IgA (45.53 U/ml, normal < 300) were negative, suggestive of acute Tubercular infection. Mantoux test was negative; tests for HBV, HCV and HIV were negative. Transaminases showed a twofold increase (AST 74 IU/l, ALT 87 IU/l) with normal bilirubin levels and normal renal function tests. Based on the fulfilment of 6/8 HLH-2004 criteria, namely fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia and bone marrow findings, a diagnosis of Haemophagocytic syndrome was made (Infection Associated HLH) [1] .",

HLH protocol was held in abeyance in the event of relapse of cytopenia or persistent fever. The patient was also exhibited anti-tubercular therapy consiting of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. With the above treatment the patient responded rapidly; respiratory distress resolved within 24\u201348 h with resolution of radiological findings on follow-up X-ray chest. High grade fever settled within 24 h, organomegaly resolved over 7\u201310 days. Cytopenias also resolved over 4\u20135 days as did biological markers of Haemophagocytic Syndrome.
