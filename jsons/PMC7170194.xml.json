Acute respiratory illnesses are responsible for more than 5 million fatalities each year in children less than 5 years of age in developing countries. The annual incidence in children less than age 5 is approximately 35 to 40 cases per 1000 in Europe and North America.1 The mortality rate from pneumonia in children in the United States has declined by 97% from 1939 to 1996.2 This decline is primarily attributable to the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s. Availability of the measles vaccine and improved access to medical care for poor children, primarily as a result of the Medicaid program, have contributed to further reduction in mortality rates recorded from 1963 to 1985. The rate of pneumonia remains high in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a global annual incidence of clinical pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age estimated to be 146.5 million new cases in developing countries and 2.1 million new cases in developed countries.3 The definition of clinical pneumonia for the purpose of the WHO estimates encompasses pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and reactive airways disease associated with respiratory infections.",

This is primarily due to limitations of diagnostic testing modalities: blood cultures, antigen testing and antibody titers, and the need for invasive means to retrieve specimens.1,\n4 Two studies illustrate our limited ability to diagnose the etiology of pneumonia in children. In a prospective study of 168 ambulatory children with CAP, an etiologic agent was identified in only 43% of cases.5 These included Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (7%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (6%). Patients with S. pneumoniae frequently had a mixed infection (40%). Of 157 patients tested for viral infection, 20% were positive by culture and/or direct fluorescent antibody test. Viral etiologies identified included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, adenovirus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. All viral isolates were identified in children less than 8 years of age.5 A similar study, in 254 hospitalized children with CAP, identified a potential causative agent in 85% of cases.6 Extensive diagnostic testing accounted for the relatively high yield in this study. Similar etiologies identified, in decreasing frequency of occurrence, included S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, M. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, C. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Viral etiologies included (most common to least common) RSV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 through 3, adenovirus, influenza virus A and B, coronavirus, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Mixed viral-bacterial infections were detected in 30% of patients, and 41% of patients had more than one microbiologic agent identified. Of interest, of 93 patients with S. pneumoniae, only one had a positive blood culture. The remaining 92 patients were diagnosed based solely on serologic evidence.6\n",

The most common etiologic agent was S. pneumoniae (44%). Of 68 patients with S. pneumoniae infection, 18% had a co-infection with another bacteria and 31% had a co-infection with a virus. Atypical agents (M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae) accounted for 22% of all infections (14% and 9%, respectively). The most common viral etiologies included influenza viruses A and B, RSV, parainfluenza viruses 1 through 3, and adenovirus.7 While S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause for pneumonia in children, atypical infections are emerging as a common respiratory pathogen, particularly in adolescents.8 In developing countries, aspiration from the upper respiratory tract accounts for nonserotypable H. influenzae as a cause of pneumonia in children.9\n",

These may include low-grade fevers and rhinorrhea. Intermediate and late findings include fever, tachypnea, and cough. Several studies have sought to identify pneumonia based solely on clinical findings. These studies define the \u201cgold standard\u201d for pneumonia diagnosis as the chest radiograph.11,\n12 Tachypnea was defined based on the WHO definition, as follows: in children less than 2 months old, respiratory rate (RR) greater than 60 breaths/min; in children 2 to 12 months old, RR greater than 50 breaths/min; and children older than 12 months, RR greater than 40 breaths/min.13,\n14 In 1997, a Canadian task force developed an evidence-based guideline to diagnose pneumonia in children. This guideline states that, although no single clinical finding may accurately diagnose pneumonia, the absence of a cluster of signs, specifically respiratory distress, tachypnea, crackles, and decreased breath sounds, excludes the presence of pneumonia with a sensitivity of 100%.1 These findings were applied to a cohort of 319 children who had a chest radiograph for possible pneumonia, 20% of whom had radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia. The Canadian guideline had a 45% sensitivity and 66% specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia when applied to this patient cohort. Additionally, tachypnea was only 10% sensitive and 5% specific in this study.15\n",

Of all clinical findings, the sensitivity to diagnose pneumonia was best for tachypnea (74%; specificity 67%), followed by retractions (71%) and rales (46%). Combinations of these improved specificity slightly, but did not improve sensitivity to recognize pneumonia. When the cohort was stratified by age, tachypnea was most sensitive: 83% in the youngest infants (<6 months old).17 In a prospective study examining RR cutoffs for pediatric patients hospitalized with pneumonia, a RR greater than 57 in infants 2 to 11 months old, a RR greater than 48 in children 1 to 5 years old, and a RR greater than 36 in children more than 5 years old identified severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization.18 These findings closely parallel the WHO definitions for tachypnea.",

Of 803 children less than 2 years of age who had a chest radiograph performed for respiratory symptoms, 80 (11%) had an opacity suggesting pneumonia. Mean pulse oximetry was not predictive of pneumonia in this cohort.20 The addition of laboratory studies to aid diagnosis has been evaluated in several ways. A study of 154 hospitalized children with CAP, of whom 79% had an identifiable etiology, compared etiologies of pneumonia with respect to clinical and laboratory findings. This analysis revealed that wheezing was most commonly seen in patients with either a viral or an atypical bacterial etiology (41%) compared to patients who had a bacterial etiology (14%). Laboratory studies showed that bacterial etiologies were more likely to be associated with bandemia and elevated serum procalcitonin compared to viral or atypical causes. A multivariate logistic analysis of all variables identified two predictors of bacterial pneumonia: elevated temperature (>38.4\u00b0 C) less than 72 hours after admission and presence of a pleural effusion, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 59%.7 Of 1248 febrile infants less than 60 days of age, three simple variables\u2014rales, RR greater than 60 breaths/min, and absolute band count less than 1500/mm3\u2014identified 85% of infants with lobar pneumonia (85% sensitivity and 59% specificity).21 It has been reported that, in a cohort of febrile children, leukocytosis as a sole diagnostic finding may indicate pneumonia, despite a lack of supportive clinical findings. A prospective cohort study of 278 febrile (temperature > 39.0\u00b0 C) children less than 5 years of age with a white blood count (WBC) greater than 20,000/mm3 identified a lobar infiltrate in 26% of patients (36 of 146) who had a radiograph performed and no signs of pneumonia.22\n",

The only clinical finding that correlates with viral infection is wheezing, yet specificity is low.7 Laboratory evaluation has been used as an adjunct to help differentiate the cause of pneumonia. Serum procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured in 126 children hospitalized for pneumonia. Children with bacterial pneumonia had higher serum procalcitonin and CRP concentrations than children with viral infections, though the specificity was low. If all three markers were elevated, the specificity for bacterial pneumonia was greater than 80%.23 In a similar study, procalcitonin was found to be more sensitive and specific than CRP, IL-6, or WBC count for differentiating bacterial and viral causes of pneumonia in hospitalized children.24 Despite these studies, procalcitonin has not become a widely used test in the evaluation of a child with pneumonia.",

As mentioned previously, identifying the microbiologic etiology of childhood pneumonia is difficult, and therefore it is problematic to assess the diagnostic capability of a radiograph related to the microbiologic etiology; as a result, the test accuracy estimate of the radiograph may be falsely low.28 A prospective report examined the influence of laboratory tests, specifically the WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum CRP, in combination with the radiograph to aid in diagnostic capability.29 In 254 children admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, a bacterial etiology was identified in 53%. Of these, 72% had an alveolar infiltrate (most commonly lobar) compared to 49% of patients with a viral infection. There was no difference between etiologies in patients with an interstitial infiltrate; 50% identified a bacterial etiology. Though there remains a fair amount of overlap, this study supports the finding that a lobar alveolar pattern is more likely to represent a bacterial etiology while an interstitial pattern does not differentiate between viral and bacterial infections. An elevated CRP (>80 mg/dl) suggested a bacterial cause (72% sensitivity and 52%specificity); however, laboratory findings did not significantly enhance the sensitivity of the radiograph in identifying a cause for pneumonia.29\n",

Since the causative pathogen is rarely known, and radiologic features do not distinguish etiology, the choice of antibiotics is based on established patterns of infection related to age and clinical findings. Several studies have found little difference in outcome when comparing different treatment modalities. One study of 88 children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia compared treatment with azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and found no difference in effectiveness. The same study compared treatment with azithromycin to erythromycin estolate in 59 children older than 5 years with pneumonia and also found no difference in outcome. Four children failed treatment, but there was no difference in failure rates among the different antibiotic regimens. Adverse events were recorded in 67% of patients who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, 25% who received erythromycin, and in 14% who received azithromycin. The most common adverse events were diarrhea and rash.5 Another study supports the use of azithromycin for pediatric bacterial pneumonia, both classic and atypical patterns.45 Oral azithromycin is found to be well tolerated with very few treatment-related adverse events.46,\n47\n",
