Now H n # H m is homeomorphic to (H n+m ) \u03b3 which is the 3-manifold H n+m with a 2-handle added along \u03b3 . Let F 0,n+m+1 be a sphere with n + m + 1 boundary components denoted by a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n+m+1 . en H n+m \u223c = F 0,n+m+1 \u00d7 I and we project links in (H n+m ) \u03b3 onto F 0,n+m+1 and work with their corresponding link diagrams. e projection of \u03b3 onto F 0,n+m+1 is represented by a red line segment as illustrated in Figure 3 . As a special case of De nition 2.4, let W = F 0,n+m+1 \u00d7 I . Consider a rectangle R, which is the regular neighbourhood of the red line segment, and its embedding under \u03c1 into F 0,n+m+1 = F 0,n+m+1 \u00d7 { 1 2 }. Choose 2k marked points on the boundary of this rectangle, with k points on the le edge and k points on the right edge. Consider the Temperley-Lieb box M = R \u00d7 I and relative links in M modulo the Kau man bracket relations. is gives rise to the Temperley-Lieb module T L k which is the relative Kau man bracket skein module of R \u00d7 I . 1 For any relative multicurve \u03ba in F 0,n+m+1 \\ R we have a module homomorphism \u03c1 * : S 2,\u221e (R \u00d7 I , {x i } 2k 1 ) \u2212\u2192 S 2,\u221e (H n+m ) as follows: for a given Temperley-Lieb element its image under \u03c1 * is obtained by gluing it to \u03ba along the 2k marked points. See Figure 4 for an example. Let z k be a multicurve in F 0,n+m+1 \u00d7 { 1 2 } obtained by gluing the identity element Id k of T L k to some \u03ba using the homomorphism \u03c1 * such that z k is in general position with the compressing disc D having geometric crossing number k with it (see Figure 4a ). In (H n+m ) \u03b3 consider the 2-handle slidings of z k along \u03b3 described in Figures 5 and 6 . ese handle slidings have support in (R \u00d7 I ) \u03b3 , the Temperley-Lieb box with a 2-handle a ached along \u03b3 . in terms of the Temperley-Lieb elements. By extension, using De nition 2.4 and embedding T L k into H n+m as described earlier, we get the relations in S 2,\u221e (H n+m ) \u03b3 .",
