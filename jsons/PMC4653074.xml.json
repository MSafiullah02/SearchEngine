Thus, deficiency in interferon production or signal transduction leads to defects in immune system\u2013mediated control of microbial pathogens in experimental animal models and in humans3,4. The biological consequences of increased activity of the interferon signaling pathway are less certain, but chronic activation of the production of type I interferons has been linked to autoimmune disease in humans5. Moreover, the administration of exogenous interferons is accompanied by toxicity that limits their pharmacological use6. Such outcomes suggest that regulation of the interferon signaling pathway is already optimized under native conditions and that enhancing this pathway might not provide a therapeutic benefit without substantial toxicity.",

An alternative strategy might be to enhance the efficiency of endogenous interferon to activate downstream signal transduction. While targeting the responsiveness of the interferon signal-transduction pathway might be desirable, it is made difficult by the complexity of the interferon signaling pathway and its functional activities. The protective actions of interferons rely on signaling through three types of interferon receptors (for type I, II and III interferons) and the JAK-STAT pathway that includes receptor-associated members of the JAK family of kinases and STAT family of transcription factors, as well as downstream modulators, transcription factors, enhancers and coactivators7. In the case of viral infection, the overall process leads to the expression of hundreds of distinct products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that provide functional effector activities but also feed back into interferon signaling2,8. Moreover, interferon signaling may also interact with other cytokine signaling pathways (for example, a pathway that includes the cytokine TNF) with additional immunological consequences9.",

Moreover, a mutant STAT1 with substitution of cysteine for alanine at positions 656 and 658 (STAT1-CC) enhances signal transduction via type I and II interferons in human cells, at least in vitro11. This enhancement is due to the enhanced capacity of STAT1-CC for transcriptosome assembly at the promoters of ISGs, which is manifested by prolonged activation (indicated by phosphorylation of Tyr701 of STAT1-CC), localization to the nucleus (indicated by binding of DNA by STAT1-CC) and recruitment of co-activators (indicated by binding of the histone acetyltransferase p300 (CBP) to STAT1-CC). Notably, STAT1-CC preserves the requirement for ligand-dependent activation. Expression of the gene encoding STAT1-CC thus offers a distinct gain-of-function approach for understanding how an improvement in interferon signaling might affect immunological function in vivo.",

We therefore developed gain-of-function models in transgenic mice and transduced human cells for controlled expression of STAT1-CC. These models showed an increase in the efficiency of interferon signaling and a consequent benefit for host defense against a broad range of viruses. Whole-genome analysis of these models showed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP9 (also known as BAL1 or ARTD9)12 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX3L were induced in concert with the interferon hyper-responsiveness. PARP9 was originally identified as being overexpressed in chemotherapy-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphomas13 and was later reported to bind to DTX3L, which in turn was found to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that selectively ubiquitinates histone H4 and protects cells against DNA-damaging agents14,15,16. That function was consistent with the conventional role of members of the PARP family in the DNA-repair response17. However, PARP9 and DTX3L have also been found in a head-to-head orientation regulated by the same bidirectional interferon-responsive promoter, and overexpression of PARP9 in a malignant B cell lymphoma cell line has been shown to cause widespread induction of ISG expression, which would suggest an alternative role for PARP9 in the interferon signaling pathway18. Here we found that PARP9 and DTX3L were STAT1-associated components for interferon signal transduction that were rate limiting and were thus able to enhance interferon efficacy and consequent host defense when expressed in larger amounts. We also identified PARP9-DTX3L as an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targeted both host histone H2BJ to promote ISG expression and viral 3C protease to disrupt viral assembly. These observations offer proof of principle of how a single molecular complex can act on host and pathogen to provide a double benefit for interferon-dependent host defense and thereby afford some guidance for the development of therapeutic agents for interferon-sensitive conditions.",

CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC mice showed similar levels of transgene expression in heart, pancreas, brain and lungs (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and exhibited normal birth frequency, development and longevity without histological evidence of autoimmunity or other disease at 2 years of age (Supplementary Fig. 1c). STAT1-CC exhibited prolonged activation (as monitored by accumulation in the nucleus in heart tissue) compared with that of endogenous STAT1 or the transgene-derived wild-type STAT1 in response to administration of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). Similarly, CAG-STAT1-CC mice showed significantly higher ISG expression (monitored as expression of mRNA from the ISGs Irf1 and Gbp3 in the pancreas) at baseline and after IFN-\u03b2 administration than did CAG-STAT1 or wild-type mice (Fig. 1a).",

After being infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) at an inoculum dose of 100 plaque-forming units (PFU), 100% of the wild-type and CAG-STAT1 mice died, whereas 97% of CAG-STAT1-CC mice survived at this inoculum, and 82% of them survived at an inoculum dose 100-fold higher (Fig. 1b). At lower viral inoculum dose (3 PFU), the survival of CAG-STAT1-CC mice was 100%, while only 25\u201328% of wild-type or CAG-STAT1 mice survived (Fig. 1b). Improved survival was associated with a markedly lower viral load at the main sites of infection (heart, brain and pancreas) in CAG-STAT1-CC mice than in wild-type or CAG-STAT1 mice (Fig. 1c). Similarly, by immunostaining of the pancreas, we found lower EMCV loads in CAG-STAT1-CC mice than in wild-type or CAG-STAT1 mice and concomitantly less tissue inflammation and injury in the heart, brain and pancreas of CAG-STAT1-CC mice (Fig. 1d,e). CAG-STAT1-CC mice were also protected against infection with influenza A virus (IAV; strain A/WS/33 or A/Vietnam/1203/04) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, although to a lesser degree than the degree of their protection against infection with EMCV (Supplementary Fig. 2). Together these findings indicated that expression of STAT1-CC allowed better control of viral loads and virus-induced tissue damage across a broad range of viruses and tissue sites.",

We also analyzed gene expression in STAT1-deficient U3A human fibrosarcoma cells transduced with retrovirus for the expression of STAT1 (U3A-STAT1) or STAT1-CC (U3A-STAT1-CC) 11. U3A-STAT1-CC cells showed more translocation of STAT1-CC to the nucleus and higher ISG expression and better control of virus following infection with EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) or Sindbis virus (SINV) than did U3A or U3A-STAT1 cells, with EMCV showing the greatest sensitivity to the actions of STAT1-CC (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar to our in vivo approach, we used whole-genome expression arrays to identify genes that were expressed differentially in U3A-STAT1-CC cells than in U3A-STAT1 at baseline or after treatment with a low dose of IFN-\u03b2 that mimics physiological conditions in vivo (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). By comparing the sets of genes expressed differentially in three conditions\u2014U3A-STAT1 cells versus U3A-STAT1-CC cells at baseline, U3A-STAT1 cells versus U3A-STAT1-CC cells with IFN-\u03b2, and CAG-STAT1 pancreatic tissues versus CAG-STAT1-CC pancreatic tissues\u2014we identified an overlapping set of genes as candidates for encoding products that mediated the observed benefit of STAT1-CC in interferon signaling function (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 4). Within this set, we identified genes whose products were not previously assigned to any direct or indirect antiviral function as candidates for further study. Among those, the gene encoding PARP9 showed the greatest difference in expression in IFN-\u03b2-treated U3A-STAT1-CC cells relative to its expression in IFN-\u03b2-treated U3A-STAT1 cells (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with the proposal of shared transcriptional regulation18, PARP9 mRNA and DTX3L mRNA and their corresponding proteins were regulated together at baseline and after interferon treatment in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells and in 2fTGH cells, the parental U3A cell line that expresses native STAT1, as well as in pancreatic tissues from CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC mice, and demonstrated greater induction in STAT1-CC-expressing conditions than in STAT1-expressing conditions (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Together these results indicated that PARP9 and DTX3L were products of ISGs that were upregulated during the expression of STAT1 or STAT1-CC in vitro (in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells) and in vivo (in CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC mice) and were therefore candidates for mediating STAT1- and STAT1-CC-dependent signal transduction.",

Specific knockdown of either PARP9 mRNA or DTX3L mRNA resulted in knockdown of both PARP9 and DTX3L protein without influencing the phosphorylation or activation of STAT1 or STAT1-CC (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013e). Knockdown PARP9 mRNA decreased the expression of DTX3L protein without a decrease in DTX3L mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013e), which suggested that PARP9 might regulate the expression of DTXL protein at a post-translational level. In contrast, knockdown of DTX3L mRNA caused a decrease in the expression of PARP9 protein that reflected the downregulation of PARP9 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013e), which suggested that DTX3L might regulate expression of the PARP9 gene at a transcriptional level. Knockdown of either PARP9 protein or DTX3L protein had no effect on the level of STAT1 or STAT1-CC (Supplementary Fig. 5c\u2013e) but still resulted in loss of STAT1-CC-mediated control of infection with EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) or SINV in U3A cells (Fig. 2d). Thus, PARP9 and DTX3L were necessary for the beneficial effect of STAT1-CC in controlling viral replication. In addition, restoring PARP9 expression to U3A cells in which PARP9 had been knocked down reversed the downregulation of DTX3L expression and reconstituted the antiviral effect of STAT1-CC on EMCV (Supplementary Fig. 5f,g), which again supported the proposal of a role for PARP9 in regulating the expression of DTX3L protein. We also found knockdown of PARP9 mRNA was overcome by treatment with interferon in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells (Supplementary Fig. 5h), which indicated the difficulty in analyzing PARP9-DTX3L loss of function under interferon-stimulation conditions.",

We found that control of the EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) or SINV viral load was improved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells but not U3A-STAT1-PARP9 or U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells, and the beneficial effect was increased by combination with interferon treatment in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (Fig. 3). These results raised the possibility that PARP9 and DTX3L might work together with STAT1 to enhance interferon signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that PARP9 and DTX3L interacted separately or together with STAT1 with or without interferon stimulation in U3A-STAT1 cells (which expressed FLAG-tagged STAT1, to facilitate these assays), and immunoblot analysis and immunostaining showed that PARP9 and DTX3L accumulated with STAT1 in the nucleus following stimulation of these cells with interferon (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In addition, we found more binding of STAT1 to the promoter of the gene encoding the interferon-response factor (and transcription factor) IRF1 (as assessed by crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay), more STAT1-driven activity of promoters of an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and an IFN-\u03b3-activated site (GAS) (based on luciferase reporter\u2013transactivation assays) and more localization of STAT1 to the nucleus (based on cell-imaging assays) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells (Fig. 4d\u2013f). However, the interactions of PARP9 and DTX3L with STAT1 in U3A-STAT1 cells were unchanged by stimulation with interferon (Fig. 4a) or substitution of STAT1 (Y701F) that eliminated the interferon-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation activation site (U3A-STAT1-Y701F cells) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Moreover, we found no difference between U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells and U3A-STAT1 cells in the interferon-driven phosphorylation of STAT1 or in the recruitment of p300 to STAT1-containing transcriptional complexes (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). Those results were in contrast to the STAT1-driven increases and STAT1-CC-driven further increases in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and recruitment of p300 to the STAT1 transcriptional complex (Supplementary Fig. 6c) to increase ISG expression and antiviral function in U3A-STAT1-CC cells11. Together these findings indicated that PARP9 and DTX3L associated with STAT1 at baseline and under interferon-stimulated conditions to modulate the localization of STAT1 to the nucleus and its transcriptional activity; however, the precise mechanism by which PARP9-DTX3L enhanced the STAT1-dependent expression of ISGs and antiviral function still needed to be defined.",

We therefore investigated whether the ability of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to detect and modify histone H4 chromatin sites during the DNA-repair response might also apply to the response to interferon stimulation. However, we did not detect ubiquitination of histone H4 at baseline or under interferon-stimulated conditions in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). To define an alternative mechanism by which PARP9-DTX3L enhanced ISG expression and antiviral control in these cells, we made structural predictions for targeted substitutions of conserved glycine residues in the PARP9 macro domains that are needed for the binding of PAR21,22 and in the cysteine residues in the DTX3L RING domain that are needed for catalytic binding of zinc23 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7a). The mutant PARP9 protein (PARP9M) was unable to bind to PAR, while the mutant DTX3L protein (DTX3LM) lacked E3 ligase activity (Supplementary Fig. 7b\u2013d). We found that the interaction of PARP9M-DTX3LM with STAT1 (Supplementary Fig. 7e), the interaction between PARP9M and DTX3LM (Supplementary Fig. 7f) and the phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to interferon (Supplementary Fig. 7g) were all preserved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells relative to those interactions and phosphorylation in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. These results indicated that the PAR-binding activity of PARP9 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DTX3L were not required for binding to or activation of STAT1 or formation of the PARP9-DTX3L complex.",

We identified a set of ISGs (for example, IFIT1, IFIT3 and OASL) whose expression was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells relative to that in U3A-STAT1 cells, but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells relative to that in U3A-STAT1 cells, and that overlapped with genes with increased expression (ISGs) from the array (Fig. 2c) of U3A-STAT1 cells treated with IFN-\u03b2 versus those not treated with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 5). Further analysis with gene-specific PCR assays showed that baseline and IFN-\u03b2-stimulated expression of these ISGs was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5c). We next used a CHART PCR assay ('chromatin accessibility by real-time PCR') to determine whether the pattern for the expression of these ISGs corresponded to an increase in chromatin accessibility (Supplementary Fig. 7h). Indeed, we found an IFN-\u03b2-stimulated increase in chromatin accessibility in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 7i). Similarly, we found that antiviral function against EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) and SINV was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells and that this enhancement was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5e). Together these results indicated that PARP9-DTX3L enhanced ISG expression and viral control by a mechanism that did not depend on the PAR-binding function of the PARP9 macro domains but might have required the ubiquitination function of the DTX3L-RING domain.",

Given the uncertainty over which histone(s) might be (a) DTX3L substrate(s), we used ubiquitin-proteome microarrays that included 29 different histones. We found that application of recombinant DTX3L to the microarray resulted in significant ubiquitination of histones H2BJ and H2AFV (isoform 3) (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 6), which indicated a high degree of selectivity for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DTX3L. Native ChIP assays showed greater ubiquitination of H2B and concomitant methylation of histone H3 at Lys4 at the IFIT1 promoter in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L than in U3A-STAT1 cells and that this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5g). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of histone H2BJ to the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1 complex in HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells transfected to express H2BJ, PARP9 and DTX3L (Supplementary Fig. 7j). We also observed more mono-ubiquitination of endogenous H2B (but not of H2A) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 6 h after infection with EMCV, and this effect was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (Supplementary Fig. 7k). Together these findings demonstrated that PARP9-DTX3L selectively ubiquitinated a subset of histones (notably H2BJ) and thereby increased histone methylation as a mechanism for chromatin remodeling and gene expression in at least a subset of ISGs (notably IFIT1), to confer enhanced antiviral function.",

At baseline (without interferon stimulation), the interaction of DTX3L with STAT1 was confined to the amino-terminal portion of DTX3L, particularly the D3 domain (Fig. 6b); the interaction of PARP9 with STAT1 was mediated through both amino- and carboxy-terminal portions of PARP9, particularly the Macro1-Macro2 and PARP domains (Fig. 6c). Similarly, binding of PARP9 to DTX3L was localized to the D3 domain of DTX3L and the PARP domain of PARP9 (Fig. 6d,e). In addition, the interaction of PARP9-DTX3L domains with STAT1 were mostly unaffected by deletion of the STAT1 transactivation domain (Fig. 6b,c), the site of interferon-inducible binding of p300 (ref. 24). Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of PARP9 interacted with STAT1 even in the absence of binding of DTX3L (Fig. 6b,c).",

We found that DTX3L-delD3, which did not interact with PARP9 (Fig. 6f) but maintained ubiquitination activity (discussed below), did not control EMCV levels (Fig. 6g) or induce ISG expression (Fig. 6h) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L-delD3 cells, whereas wild-type DTX3L did control EMCV levels and induce ISG expression in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. Similarly, PARP9-M12, which did not interact with DTX3L (Fig. 6f), did not induce ISG expression (Fig. 6h) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-M12-DTX3L cells, whereas wild-type PARP9 did induce ISG expression in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. Of note, both PARP9-M12, which did not interact with DTX3L, and DTX3L-delD3, which did not interact with PARP9, still interacted with STAT1 (Fig. 6g), which indicated a redundant role in recruiting STAT1 to the complex. Together these results defined a carefully ordered set of domain requirements for the interactions of PARP9 and DTX3L with each other as well as of PARP9-DTX3L with STAT1 in the ISG-dependent response for the control of viral infection.",

We found lower expression of EMCV 3C in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 6 h after infection with EMCV (Fig. 7a). We did not detect a decrease in EMCV 3C in infected U3A cells that had not undergone complementation for STAT1 expression (Fig. 7a), consistent with a role for the products of STAT1-dependent ISGs (for example, PSMB, PSME and PMSF) in proteasome activity26 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 1\u20134). Moreover, the decrease in EMCV 3C persisted in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells, was lost in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells and was preserved in U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9 cells (Fig. 7a). The observations that DTX3L alone was able to decrease the amount of EMCV 3C but was unable to fully control viral loads (Fig. 3a) suggested that PARP9 must have also contributed to the antiviral effect under conditions of interferon stimulation or viral infection, as well as at baseline. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the immunoproteasome component, PSMB8, effectively attenuated the degradation of EMCV 3C at 6 h after infection in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (Fig. 7b). The effect of DTX3L was specific to the degradation of EMCV 3C rather than an overall decrease in viral load, because the effect was independent of the amount of viral RNA at 6 h after infection (Fig. 7c). We also found a smaller amount of EMCV 3C in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 18 h after infection with or without treatment with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 7d). Expression of PARP9-DTX3L or DTX3L via transient transfection in HEK293T cells also caused a decrease in EMCV 3C expression, and this effect was sensitive to blockade with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and was similar to the decrease in the amount of EMCV 3C found with expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM22 (Fig. 7e), which has been linked to the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C27. Treatment with MG-132 also increased the amount of EMCV 3C without influencing the expression of EMCV RNA during infection of primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (Fig. 7f,g). These cells also showed induction of the expression of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L after treatment with IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 and interaction of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L with STAT1 (Fig. 7h).",

            "text": "The findings reported above raised the possibility that DTX3L might contain a distinct domain for direct targeting of viral 3C proteases for ubiquitination. Indeed, by using recombinant proteins in an in vitro ubiquitination assay, we found that DTX3L ubiquitinated EMCV 3C (Fig. 8d). The ubiquitination of EMCV 3C by DTX3L was not affected by titration of various amounts of recombinant PARP9 into the in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 8e), which ruled against the possibility of competition between the two proteins for binding to their substrate. We confirmed specificity for the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C by purification of the histidine- and V5-tagged ubiquitinated EMCV 3C reaction product with nickel\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Fig. 8f). DTX3L also ubiquitinated the related human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease (Fig. 8g) that exhibits a pattern of early localization to the nucleus and late localization to the cytosol during infection similar to that of the EMCV 3C protease30. In vitro ubiquitination assays further showed that DTX3L did not require PARP9 for activity against EMCV 3C or HRV 3C (Fig. 8d\u2013g) and that DTX3L was able to mediate Lys48 (K48)-linked ubiquitination of EMCV 3C (Fig. 8h). Recombinant DTX3L did not ubiquitinate the respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural protein NS1 (Fig. 8i), which is linked to ubiquitination-dependent degradation of host proteins31; this indicated that ubiquitination by DTX3L was at least somewhat specific to viral 3C proteases. DTX3L-delD3 and even DTX3L-RDTXH alone maintained ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (Fig. 8j), which suggested that the RING and DTXH domains of DTX3L mediated ubiquitination and substrate recognition. Through the use of biolayer interferometry (a system for measuring protein interactions in real time), we were able to detect concentration-dependent interactions between recombinant DTX3L-RDTXH and both EMCV 3C and HRV 3C (Fig. 8k). Thus, the RING-DTXH domains of DTX3L were sufficient for the recognition of EMCV 3C and HRV 3C proteases and complemented the ability of the D1\u2013D3 domains of DTX3L to bind PARP9-STAT1. In addition, using co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect V5-labeled EMCV 3C and hemagglutinin-labeled ubiquitin, we found that the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C was lower in HEK293T cells expressing PARP9M-DTX3LM than in those expressing PARP9-DTX3L (Fig. 8l). Together these results indicated that PARP9-DTX3L interacted with viral 3C proteases to target them for degradation and thus attacked the pathogen directly, in concert with interaction at ISG promoters to enhance the host response to viruses.",

We identified PARP9 and DTX3L on the basis of their increased expression in a gain-of-function system wherein modification of STAT1 to STAT1-CC (containing two cysteine substitutions in the Src homology 2 domain) enhanced the response to type I and II interferons and thereby broadly and safely provided protection against otherwise lethal viral infections in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis of this enhanced interferon responsiveness showed that PARP9 interacted with DTX3L and STAT1 and functioned as a chaperone to enhance levels of the PARP9-DTX3L protein complex and STAT1-mediated ISG expression. In addition, DTX3L interacted with a subset of host histones (notably histone H2BJ) and viral proteases (specifically viral 3C proteases) to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for both of these substrates. By targeting these substrates, DTX3L tailored chromatin accessibility for the expression of a specific subset of ISGs and promoted immunoproteasome-dependent blockade of viral replication. Each of these endpoints contributed separately to the control of viral infection. These findings place PARP9-DTX3L in a new context and establish interferon-driven ubiquitination as a key immunomodulatory step that might be targeted to enhance interferon signaling and control infection.",

            "text": "The multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L was based on the use of distinct protein domains for interactions among PARP9, DTX3L, STAT1 and specific ubiquitination substrates (histones and viral 3C proteases). Thus, the dual function of DTX3L was mediated by binding of DTX3L to PARP9 via the D3 domain of DTX3L (to increase the level of DTX3L and its consequent function) and to ubiquitnation substrates via the RDTXH domain of DTX3L (to enable degradation of viral 3C and histone modification). In addition, the D1\u2013D3 domains of DTX3L bound weakly to STAT1, and the macro and PARP domains of PARP9 bound strongly to STAT1, consistent with evidence that PARP9 also interacts with STAT1 via the macro domains of PARP9 in B cell lymphoma cell lines32. However, we found that the binding of PARP9-STAT1 was independent of conventional binding of the PARP macro domain to ADP-ribosylated histones described for the DNA-repair response16,33 and thus seemed to be specially 'tuned' to the interferon system. Since both STAT1 and the EMCV 3C protease traffic to nuclear and cytosolic sites25,28,29, binding of PARP9-DTX3L to STAT1 and EMCV 3C would allow at least two aids for the PARP9-DTX3L complex to also traffic to these two sites. This fits with detection of the PARP9\u2013DTX3L\u2013STAT1\u2013EMCV 3C complex at both sites during infection and the ability of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to control viral and host gene expression in the nucleus and viral assembly in the cytoplasm. Since we also found that the PARP-DTX3L-STAT1 interaction occurred at baseline, the complex seemed to be ready in advance of infection. Moreover, PARP9 enhanced the level of DTX3L protein, and PARP9-DTX3L in turn promoted the expression of PARP9 and DTX3L, so that formation of the PARP9-DTX3L complex was also able to auto-amplify in response to the interferon production that developed after infection.",

For example, PARP1 directly 'poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates' viral proteins to control viral replication34,35. In contrast, PARP9 completely lacks PARP enzymatic activity. PARP13 (ZAP) interacts directly with viral proteins but recruits the RNA exosome to mediate degradation without a ubiquitination mechanism36, and a shorter isoform of PARP13 (ZAPS) associates with the RNA helicase RIG-I to increase expression of interferons and other cytokines as an antiviral mechanism37. PARP12L, PARP7 and PARP10 might also have some antiviral activity, but the basis for this activity has been linked to the translation of viral and cellular RNA38. PARP14 regulates the activity of STAT6, but in contrast to results obtained for PARP9-DTX3L, the enzymatic activity of PARP was again required, no E3 ligase partner was identified, and DNA binding was undetectable39. In addition, we found no decrease in the level or function of STAT1 after overexpression of PARP9-DTX3L. Therefore, the action of PARP9-DTX3L was also distinct from that of E3 ubiquitin ligases that target STAT1 to downregulate interferon signaling40.",

            "text": "The identification of the actions of PARP9-DTX3L could provide valuable lessons for harnessing a safe reserve in the interferon signaling pathway for therapeutic benefit. In particular, we learned that PARP9-DTX3L contained modules for interaction with each other and with STAT1, specific cellular histones and viral 3C proteases to control viral infection at two levels (expression of host ISGs and degradation of viral 3C proteases) and two cellular sites (nucleus and cytoplasm). It therefore seems to be critical to understand and retain the multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L to safely and effectively enhance interferon signal performance. We also learned that PARP9-DTX3L was especially suited to control viral 3C proteases, which, along with 3C-like proteases, are required for the wide range of common picornaviruses and other important pathogens in the picornavirus-like supercluster that includes certain coronaviruses and caliciviruses41. Thus, PARP9-DTX3L provides a particular 'road map' to guide the translation of these results toward a broad-acting next-generation therapeutic for this class of viruses. Indeed, small-molecule interferon signal\u2013enhancer compounds have been identified in a cell-based screen for ISRE-driven luciferase reporter activity and have been shown to increase host ISG expression and control the level of EMCV and HRV in 2fTGH cells and primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells42. Whether these compounds also promote the degradation of viral 3C proteases and depend on PARP9-DTX3L expression for antiviral activity still needs to be determined. Nonetheless, small-molecule interferon signal\u2013enhancer\u2013type agents that mimic the antiviral mechanism of STAT1-CC and PARP9-DTX3L should help to fill the unmet need for protection against the acute illness and chronic inflammatory disease that develop with picornavirus infection43 and perhaps the need for the treatment of other interferon-sensitive conditions.",
