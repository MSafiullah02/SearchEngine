Six weeks after radiation, she developed a non-productive cough, which was initially managed conservatively. One week later her symptoms progressed and she was started on empiric high-dose corticosteroids for presumed RP. One week later, her symptoms of cough and dyspnea progressed, and she presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with hypoxia. She was tested for COVID-19 and was found to be positive. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities, mostly pronounced outside the radiation field ( Figure 1 ). Patient 2: A 56-year-old male with a T1cN3M0, Stage IIIB, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive thoracic radiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with concurrent cisplatin/pemetrexed. Eleven weeks after radiation, he developed a non-productive cough and mildly increased dyspnea on exertion and was managed conservatively. Approximately four weeks later, he presented with fever and worsening cough and dyspnea. A fever work-up including a standard viral respiratory panel was negative. COVID-19 testing was unavailable at the time. Chest CT imaging revealed mild inflammatory changes within the radiation field, and he was started on empiric highdose corticosteroids for presumed RP. One week after starting corticosteroids, his symptoms progressed, and he presented to the ED with hypoxia. He was tested for COVID-19 and was found to be positive. Patient 3: A 66-year-old female with a T1bN2M0, Stage IIIA SCLC treated with definitive twice-daily thoracic radiation (45 Gy in 1.5Gy fractions) with concurrent carboplatin/etoposide. Eight weeks after radiation, she reported a new onset nonproductive cough and increased dyspnea requiring increased albuterol use. She denied fever, fatigue or decreased appetite. Out of caution, COVID-19 testing was recommended, which returned positive, and she was not treated for RP. Patient 4: A 65-year-old female with a history of a T1N2M0, stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the right lung treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation in 2006 (59.4 Gy in 33 fractions), who then developed an in-field recurrence and was treated with definitive reirradiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) concurrent with cisplatin/pemetrexed followed by consolidative durvalumab. Sixteen weeks after reirradiation, she presented with a progressive non-productive cough and dyspnea. Chest CT imaging demonstrated mild inflammatory-changes within the radiation field, and empiric short-course corticosteroids were prescribed, which initially improved symptoms. After completing an initial shortcourse of corticosteroids, she presented with fever and worsening cough and dyspnea. COVID-19 testing was recommended which returned negative. She was then started on a high-dose corticosteroid taper for RP, which improved symptoms.",
