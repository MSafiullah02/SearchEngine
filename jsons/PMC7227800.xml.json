Quarantine separates people and restricts the movement of those who may have been exposed to a contagious disease to find out if they become sick and to prevent the disease from spreading.",

Indeed, psychiatric history is a risk factor for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger 4\u20136 months after removal from quarantine [5]. Furthermore, history of psychiatric illness is a reliable predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder development in adults exposed to disaster/traumatic-related experiences [6, 7]. Being quarantined involves losing daily routines and personal and social contacts that make life meaningful and provide psychological support, and it comes with substantial costs for individuals with mental illnesses.",
