Here, we establish the recently discovered pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis 147 as an effective hostcentered antiviral strategy. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating viral replication without causing toxicity in host cells. 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs using RNAi and other PDI small molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting additional identified protein targets of 147 may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of Dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.",

The genus encompasses several arthropod-borne viruses including Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), and Zika (ZIKV) (Bhatt et al., 2013; Daep et al., 2014; Weaver et al., 2016) . These viruses pose serious public health threats, particularly as increased global travel and climate change have caused an increase in the spread of both the virus and their mosquito vectors (A. albopictus and A. aegypti) (Tatem et al., 2012; Whitehorn and Yacoub, 2019) . It is estimated that 53% of the world population lives in areas suitable for Dengue transmission resulting in 50-100 million Dengue infections per year, of which 500,000 proceed to Dengue hemorrhagic fever and 22,000 are fatal (Bhatt et al., 2013; Messina et al., 2019) . ZIKV infection has been linked to serious neurological defects, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly in newborns (Mendez et al., 2017) . While ZIKV diagnoses were relatively rare until the early 2000s, the 2015-2016 pandemic in the Americas highlighted the potential for rapid spread of the disease vectors (Weaver et al., 2016) .",

The first DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia, was approved by the FDA in early 2019 (Thomas and Yoon, 2019) . However, its use remains limited to children with confirmed prior infection. In addition, no post-exposure therapeutic options are available for patients infected with these viruses; current treatments only attempt to alleviate the symptoms (Bernatchez et al., 2020; Lim, 2019; Lim et al., 2013) . Antiviral strategies often focus on directly targeting viral proteins. While molecules inhibiting for instance the flavivirus RNAdependent RNA polymerase NS5 or the protease NS3 have been identified, the high mutation rate of the virus allows for resistance to be developed quickly (Bernatchez et al., 2020; Carrasco-Hernandez et al., 2017; Garcia et al., 2017) . One increasing area of exploration for alternative therapeutic approaches is the targeting of host factors that are critical for virus propagation (Kaufmann et al., 2018) . As these proteins are not under genetic control of the virus, development of resistance is much less likely (De Clercq, 2007; Geller et al., 2013 Geller et al., , 2007 . In addition, host-targeted therapeutics should be effective as broad-spectrum antivirals instead of targeting a single virus (Aviner and Frydman, 2020; Taguwa et al., 2019 Taguwa et al., , 2015 .",

            "text": "Flaviviruses contain a genome of positive-sense, single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) approximately 11kb in size. The viruses replicate and assemble around the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Apte-Sengupta et al., 2014) . As the genome is translated after entry into the cell, the single polyprotein is inserted into the ER membrane and is co-and post-translationally processed into three structural (capsid, pre-membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) proteins (Perera and Kuhn, 2008) . The host proteostasis network has been implicated in the maintenance of individual viral proteins and virus evolution (Aviner and Frydman, 2020; Phillips et al., 2017; Ravindran, 2018; Reid et al., 2018) . The proteostasis network is comprised of chaperones, co-chaperones and other protein quality control factors that control protein folding, assembly, post-translational modification, trafficking, and degradation. Genetic screens have identified many proteostasis factors as essential for DENV replication, including several components of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex, as well as the ER membrane protein complex (Lin et al., 2019; Marceau et al., 2016; Ngo et al., 2019; Savidis et al., 2016) . Aside from promoting biogenesis of viral proteins, these components also have additional roles in organizing viral replication centers at the ER membrane (Marceau et al., 2016; Ngo et al., 2019; Rothan and Kumar, 2019) . Additionally, diverse cellular chaperone and co-chaperone systems are required for all stages of the viral life cycle, including virus entry and disassembly, folding of individual viral proteins, as well as assembly and egress of new virions (Fischl and Bartenschlager, 2011; Heaton et al., 2016; Taguwa et al., 2019) . Pharmacologic inhibition of proteostasis factors, including the OST as well as cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones, has been shown to be an effective strategy to reduce flavivirus infection in cell models (Heaton et al., 2016; Howe et al., 2016; Puschnik et al., 2017; Taguwa et al., 2019 Taguwa et al., , 2015 Yang et al., 2020) .",

The UPR consists of three overlapping but distinct signaling branches downstream of the stress-sensing receptors IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), and PERK (Protein kinase R-like ER kinase) (Shoulders et al., 2013; Walter and Ron, 2011) . The first two branches primarily control the upregulation of chaperones and other proteostasis factors to expand the protein folding capacity of the ER. The PERK branch is responsible for translational attenuation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) and subsequent activation of the integrated stress response. DENV has been shown to upregulate the IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 branches of the UPR, while suppressing activation of the PERK branch (Pe\u00f1a and Harris, 2011) . The importance of UPR-dependent ER proteostasis remodeling for flavivirus infection has only been explored in knockout cell models. For example, the virus was less capable of propagating in IRE1 -/-MEF cells. In contrast, PERK knockout resulted in increased viral titers, while ATF6 knockout did not impact viral propagation.

We determine that the 147 mediated reduction in DENV replication and assembly is surprisingly not mediated through activation of ATF6. Instead, the activity is mediated by upstream covalent modifications of protein targets by 147. Prior work identified protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) as critical targets for the 147-dependent ATF6 activation , however, our data suggests PDIs are not responsible for the antiviral activity. Finally, we show that 147 treatment can reduce proliferation of multiple DENV serotypes and several ZIKV strains, demonstrating that the pharmacologic agent could be a broadly effective strategy against flaviviruses and other viruses that depend on ER proteostasis processes.",

To confirm the activation of ER proteostasis pathways by DENV, we performed an infection time-course with DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) in Huh7 liver carcinoma cells and measured transcript levels of an ATF6-regulated gene (PDIA4) and an XBP1s-regulated gene (ERDJ4) by quantitative RT-PCR. Both PDIA4 and ERDJ4 transcripts exhibited a time-dependent induction in response to DENV2 infection (Fig. 1B) . A smaller but similar time-dependent upregulation of ATF6 and XBP1s-regulated protein products could be observed by western blot (Fig.   S1A ). To corroborate these findings, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis of Huh7 cells at 24 and 36 hours post infection (hpi) with DENV2 to quantify global changes in protein expression ( Fig. S1B-C, Table S1 ). We found that DENV2 activated specific factors involved in ER proteostasis maintenance, such as DNAJC10, BiP, and HYOU1.",

To determine at what stage in the viral life cycle the compound treatment impaired viral propagation, we investigated the impact of compound 147 on viral RNA (vRNA) and protein levels ( Fig. 2C-D) . Quantification of vRNA by qPCR indicated a modest but significant reduction of 50% at 24 hpi, which was attenuated to 30% reduction at 36 hpi ( Fig. 2E) . Western blot quantification of NS3 and NS5 viral protein in Huh7 cell lysates from DENV2 infected cells showed a 35 -80 % reduction in viral non-structural proteins in response to 147 treatment (Fig. 2F, Fig. S2D ). This highlighted that the ER proteostasis regulator exerted a more pronounced effect on viral protein production relative to replication of vRNA. In contrast, infectious viral titers showed a far greater reduction reaching 98% at 12 hpi and sustaining 80% reduction at 36 hpi (Fig. 2G) . The intensified effect of 147 on viral titers compared to vRNA and protein levels suggests that the compound predominantly acts on a stage subsequent to translation of viral proteins, which would be consistent with disruption of viral maturation or secretion pathways through modulation of ER proteostasis. Lastly, we confirmed that 147 did not impair viral entry. Omission of the pretreatment prior to infection and treatment of Huh7 cells with the compound only after infection still resulted in a comparable reduction in viral protein and titers, confirming that the compound must act at a post-entry stage ( Fig. S2E-G) .",

We therefore sought to investigate whether ATF6 activation and induction of ATF6-targeted proteostasis factors was required for the 147-dependent inhibition of DENV infection. We first confirmed by qPCR and quantitative Western blot analysis that treatment with 147 activated the ATF6 regulated gene HSPA5 (BiP) in Huh7 cells (Fig. S3A) . To probe the impact of ATF6 activation on the compound activity, we took advantage of the ATF6 inhibitor Cp7, which inhibits ATF6 . Cp7 mediates a neomorphic interaction between ATF6 and the peroxisomal membrane protein ABCD3, keeping ATF6 in a traffickingincompetent oligomeric state, which cannot be activated by 147 (Fig. 3A ) (Torres et al., 2019) . We confirmed by qPCR and Western blot that co-treatment with 147 and Cp7 could fully attenuate the 147-dependent induction of ATF6 target genes in Huh7 cells ( Fig. S3A) . We then investigated the addition of Cp7 on the 147-mediated reduction of DENV propagation. Co-treatment of Cp7 did not diminish the reduction in vRNA or NS3 protein ( Fig. 3B-C) . Furthermore, the addition of Cp7 only partially recovered the DENV2 viral titers at 24hpi (Fig. 3D) . These results highlight that the reduction in viral titers could not be fully attributed to the 147-mediated induction of ATF6 target genes.",

We confirmed TMP-dependent upregulation of ATF6-regulated targets BiP, PDIA4, and GRP94 in Huh7 cells ( Fig. S3B-C) . Next, we pre-treated Huh7 cells with TMP to activate DHFR.ATF6, infected cells with DENV2, and quantified propagation of the virus by monitoring viral protein levels by Western blot and measuring infectious titers. Chemicalgenetic ATF6 activation did not lead to a measurable reduction in viral protein levels ( Fig.  3F ). At the same time, a moderate decrease in viral titers could be observed, but this reduction in viral propagation was much lower than seen with 147 treatment (Fig. 3G) .",

Previous studies showed that 147 is a prodrug and requires metabolic activation in cells to generate a reactive p-quinone methide that can then form protein adducts with reactive cysteine residues ( Fig. 4A ) (Palmer et al., 2020; Paxman et al., 2018; Plate et al., 2016) . In several cell types, ER-resident protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) were identified as the common protein targets of 147, and this modulation of PDIs was linked to the activation of ATF6 . To explore whether covalent targeting of reactive thiols by 147 is required for the reduction in DENV propagation, we blocked the covalent modifications through addition of an excess of the small-molecule thiol 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) to the cells treated with 147 (Fig. 4A) . We confirmed that this addition did not impair cell viability (Fig. S4B) , and that BME alone only had a minimal effect on viral protein levels (Fig. S4A) . When BME was added to DENV infected cells that were treated with 147, this resulted in a partial to complete recovery of NS5 protein at 24 and 36hpi, respectively (Fig. 4B) . Similarly, the reduction in DENV2 viral titers was partially attenuated by the addition of BME (Fig. 4C) . These results indicate that the targeting of cellular thiol groups is required for the inhibition of virus propagation.",

Previous studies determined the covalent targets of 147 in HEK293T, HepG2, and ALLC plasma cells . However, it was conceivable that the metabolic activation mechanism differs in cell types and could result in alternative targets. We therefore determined whether 147 could similarly target PDIs in Huh7 cells. We took advantage of the active analog 147-20, which contains an alkyne handle that enables further Click chemistry derivatization with desthiobiotin after protein labeling, followed by isolation of the targeted proteins on streptavidin resin (Fig. 5A) . The desthiobiotin probe also contained a TAMRA fluorophore that allowed gel-based visualization of the targeted proteins (Fig. 5B) . We confirmed that 147-20 retained activity reducing DENV titer levels and NS3 protein levels in infected cells ( Fig. S5A-B) . In contrast, treatment with 147-4, an inactive analog where generation of the quinone methide is blocked by the trifluoromethyl group, did not reduce infection. We probed for the presence of specific PDIs (PDIA4, PDIA1, PDIA6), which were identified as 147 targets in other cell lines. These proteins were clearly detectable at molecular weights of prominent labeled bands that were competed by 147, confirming them as targets in Huh7 cells (Fig. 5B, S5C ) . In DENV-infected cells that were treated with 147-20, no additional labeled protein bands were observed, indicating that viral proteins are not directly targeted by the compound (Fig. S5D) .",

Importantly, these molecules display different degrees of specificity towards PDIA1 relative to other PDIs, mirroring the polypharmacology observed with 147. We profiled the specific PDIs targeted by the compounds in Huh7 cells by modifying the alkyne handles on the molecule with a fluorophore. KSC-34 displayed the greatest preference for PDIA1, while Rb-11-ca also labeled PDIA4, PDIA6, and several other proteins (Fig. 5SG) . This is consistent with observations in other cell types and the development of KSC-34 as a more specific derivative of Rb-11-ca (Cole et al., 2018) . 16F16 does not contain an alkyne handle but previous studies show even broader reactivity towards PDIs than Rb-11-ca (Hoffstrom et al., 2010) . We then tested the effect of the compounds on DENV2 infection in Huh7 cells using the same treatment regime as for 147. KSC-34 and 16F16 were unable to reduce viral NS3 protein levels (Fig. 5D ). Rb-11-ca was able to lower viral protein production by 40%; however, this reduction did not translate into lower viral titers ( Fig. 5E) . Reduction in viral protein levels with Rb-11-ca could be attributed to compound toxicity, as we observed a 40% reduction in cell viability (Fig. S5H) . These results indicate that targeting of individual PDIs is not solely responsible for the reduced viral titers by 147 and that these existing PDI inhibitors are not effective at inhibiting DENV replication.",

This analysis confirmed that PDIs were the most highly enriched proteins that were covalently targeted by 147-20 (Fig. 6B, Fig. S6A , Table S2 ). While labeling of PDIA4, PDIA6, and PDIA1 was confirmed above, we identified additional targeted PDIs (TXNDC5, PDIA3, TXM1) and two other highly enriched protein targets (GSTO1 and ALDH1A1). We compared these targets to previous datasets of 147-20 targets in HEK293T, HepG2, and ALMC-2 plasma cells (Fig. 6C, Fig. S6B ) .

To determine the scope of 147 antiviral activity, we tested the effect against DENV-2 propagation in HepG2 cells, another liver carcinoma cell line commonly used as an infection model. Prior data also showed that 147 treatment is non-toxic in HepG2 cells and can reduce amyloidogenic protein secretion (Plate et al., 2016) . When testing the impact on DENV titers in HepG2 cells, 147 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in DENV propagation 48 hpi ( Figure 7A) . A similar decrease in protein levels was also detected (Fig. S7A) . Next, we proceeded to test whether the compound could be more broadly effective against other DENV strains. We tested 147 against a different DENV-2 strain (16681, isolated in 1984 in Thailand) as well as against strains from DENV serotypes 3 and 4 (Kinney et al., 1997) . Treatment with compound 147 was able to reduce viral titers consistently greater than 95% (Fig. 7B-D) and protein levels were similarly reduced (Fig. S7B) . Finally, we sought to test whether compound 147 could be useful to treat other flaviviruses. We measured the effect against two different strains of Zika virus; MR766 (isolated from Eastern Africa in the 1950s), and PRVABC59 (isolated from Puerto Rico in 2015) (Dick and Kitchen, 1952; Lanciotti et al., 2016) . The molecule displayed similar activity at reducing ZIKV titers and protein levels for both strains (Fig. 7E-F, Fig. S7C-D) . These results provide evidence that compound 147 is broadly active against flaviviruses in multiple cell lines, thus facilitating its potential application as an extensive host-centered antiviral agent.",

Therapeutic methods which target host factors required for viral propagation provide a path unlikely to elicit drug resistance and may act broadly across several virus species (Aviner and Frydman, 2020; Geller et al., 2013 Geller et al., , 2007 . However, a challenge remains to target host factors that selectively impair viral replication without causing toxicity to the host cell and infected organism. Prior studies with 147 have already indicated that the compound has broad potential to safely ameliorate proteostasis imbalances that are associated a variety of disease conditions (Blackwood et al., 2019; Plate et al., 2016) . The compound is effective at reducing the secretion and aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, such as immunoglobulin light chains and transthyretin (Plate et al., 2016) . In addition, selective remodeling of ER proteostasis pathways through an ATF6-dependent mechanism by 147 was shown to prevent oxidative organ damage in mouse models of ischemia/reperfusion (Blackwood et al., 2019) . The same study also showed that 147 could be safely administered to mice through IV injections and was able to activate ER proteostasis pathways in multiple tissues, including liver, kidney and heart (Blackwood et al., 2019) .",

Cp7 on its own also did not reduce virus infection, which is consistent with prior knockout of ATF6 not affecting DENV propagation (Pe\u00f1a and Harris, 2011) .

We showed that the antiviral activity of 147 could be attenuated with BME treatment, demonstrating that the metabolic activation mechanism and covalent targeting of reactive thiols is similarly required to reduce virus infection. We repeated the chemoproteomic target identification in Huh7 cells using an analog of 147 and identified a similar set of PDIs, including PDIA1, PDIA4, and PDIA6, as targets in this cell line. However, knockdown of individual PDIs was not sufficient to reduce viral titers suggesting that these individual PDIs are not responsible for the inhibition of viral infection. This raises the possibility that 1) polypharmacologic targeting of multiple PDIs may be necessary to sufficiently impair virus propagation, or 2) alternative 147-targets are responsible for the antiviral effects.",
