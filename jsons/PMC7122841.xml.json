Individuals reaching great age are often affected by limited immunocompetence, referred to as \u201cimmunosenescence.\u201d In B cell biology, immunosenescence is reflected by altered quantity, quality, and composition of B cells and antibodies, and their spatial organization during an immune response and the memory phase. Germinal centers as key structures for B cell differentiation and selection are impaired in numbers, size, and function. To this end, other cells and processes underlying senescent impairment, such as T cells, cytokine production, and antigen presentation as well as the nonlymphoid B cell microenvironment, regulate and impact age-dependently on B cell function and responses.",

            "text": "Briefly, B cells are generated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow (BM), where they mature and become na\u00efve B cells which are released into the periphery. During their maturation in the BM, B cells rearrange their immunoglobulin genes encoding the B cell receptor and antibody molecules, thus determining the antigen specificity of an individual B cell. Gene rearrangement activity alternates with cell proliferation, so a highly diverse repertoire of B cells is generated, each carrying an individual specificity and unique B cell receptor (BCR). Na\u00efve B cells can be activated by binding an antigen through the BCR. This is followed by proliferation and differentiation into either plasmablasts, which secrete large amounts of antibody of the same specificity as the BCR, or into memory B cells, which remain in the periphery after the acute immune response has ceased. Such memory B cells can be activated by the same antigen to differentiate again into plasmablasts or memory B cells, both being of enhanced potency and responsiveness to recurrent antigen challenge. Somatic hypermutation (SHM), class switch recombination (CSR), and selection for antigen affinity are characteristics of germinal center reactions and memory B cell responses engaging T cell help, which may occur in spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Terminally differentiated antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells can persist for years or decades in one\u2019s body, with yet not fully defined contributions of self-renewal and longevity of these cells. Whereas memory B cells reside in secondary lymphoid organs and the blood, plasma cells reside in the BM [1, 2]. For almost all of these B cell differentiation stages, properties, and functions, age-related changes are detectable, being mainly associated with reduced immune function and protection. As, e.g., T cells are apparently more greatly affected by age than B cells [3], some works have directly or indirectly questioned the inherent senescence of B cells [4\u20137], and the contributions of inherent and extrinsic factors to senescent B cell responses remain to be elucidated [8, 9]. It is generally discussed whether age-related immune phenomena reflect or cause the reaching of great age or whether immunosenescence is a process of remodeling the immune system or an indication of immunodeficiency [9, 10]. In this regard, healthy centenarians often show a different pattern of changes as compared with the 70\u201385-year-old population with a considerable impact of frailty.",

The success of B cell depletion underlines the key role of B cells in immune responses to autologous antigens [33]. Patients treated with B cell depletion therapy with rituximab (used in both autoimmunity and CD20+ lymphoma treatment) do not develop sufficient antibody titers when vaccinated during therapy [34, 35], but remain widely protected during therapy because previously established plasma cells are not affected and respective antibody titers are slightly or not affected by rituximab treatment [36, 37].

Although pro-B cell numbers and RAG-1 mRNA amounts within this fraction were normal in aged mice [47, 51], they expressed less RAG-2 and showed less V(D)J recombinase activity [52, 53] and gave rise to fewer pre-B cells in vivo and in vitro [47, 49]. Both D to J and V to DJ recombination were diminished in old mice at the stages of early and late pro-B cells, so defective pre-BCR expression was suggested to contribute to pre-B cells apoptosis [54]. Indeed, surrogate light chain expression was decreased in pre-B cells of senescent mice [55] and was associated with decreased E2A expression [56]. When B cells expressing IgH and IgL transgenes were introduced, which do not need to undergo rearrangement, the numbers of transgenic B cells were normal, whereas endogenous B cell numbers with natural rearrangement of IgL and IgH genes were reduced in aged mice [51].",

Hence, the way and strength of B cell activation might influence B cell responses by determining telomere lengthening.

Consistently, functional B cells could be recovered more than 10 months after their transfer to scid mice, and can be utilized in antibody responses [82]. The half-life of peripheral mature B cells from old mice is increased (decreased turnover) and reduced levels of newly generated B cells are detected in the periphery as demonstrated using in vivo 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling experiments. In old mice, the numbers of immature splenic B cells were found to be reduced fourfold, with a concurrent reduction of the numbers of BM surface IgD\u2212/surface IgMint/high B cells, but not least mature surface IgD\u2212/surface IgMvery low B cells [83]. After 4 weeks of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling, 15% of mature and transitional B cells were newly made in old mice compared with 30% in young mice. Immature B cell production rates did not differ between old and young mice in this study, so defective replenishment of peripheral compartments rather than impaired B lymphopoiesis was reasoned to be responsible for reduced peripheral counts of immature B cells in aged mice [84]. In summary, the mature peripheral B cell compartment semms to stably persist in ageing mice, and this has been shown to be independent of age [85, 86].",

            "text": "Memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells constitute the immunological B cell memory. For both, long-tem persistence in the absence of antigens has been demonstrated [89\u201391] and directly challenged for memory B cells [92] or questioned as a means to provide humoral memory for plasma cells [93, 94]. There is accumulating evidence for a distinct regulation of the memory B cell compartment and humoral memory provided by plasma cells [36, 37, 95\u201398], as reflected by persistent antibody production in the absence of memory B cells. They are maintained in the body at different sites and by distinct mechanisms. Memory B cells reside in lymphoid tissues such as spleen [96], tonsils [99], lymph nodes, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, and the blood [1] and depend on the presence of the spleen [100], reflected by their gradual disappearance from peripheral blood after splenectomy in humans [95] and concurrent increased susceptibility to microbial infections. Low frequencies of circulating memory B cells proliferate, allowing the maintenance of the whole population [88] and single specificities. By contrast, most mature plasma cells reside mainly in the BM [101, 102], where they can survive and secrete antibody potentially for decades in old mice and humans [91, 97, 103], reflected by persistent antigen-specific antibody titers in human blood serum of adults aged 20\u201365 years [104]. Long-lived plasma cells are maintained by a yet incompletely explored, hence hypothetical, survival niche which comprises, e.g., stromal cells and their products, such as IL-6 and CXCL12, as well as extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin or hyaluronans [105\u2013108]. The BM microenvironment becomes less potent to support B cell development with age [31] and senescent stromal cells exhibit limited survival and functionality [61], which might implicate a role of the senescent BM microenvironment in reduced plasmablast recruitment and plasma cell survival [109], similarly as shown in 1-week-old mice not yet having adult immune capabilities [110, 111]. At very young age, BM stromal cells largely fail to support plasma cell survival and persistent antibody memory [110, 111]. Thereafter, from 6 to 14 weeks of age, approximately 20% of plasma cells may become long-lived, as demonstrated in lupus-prone New Zealand Black/New Zealand White mice (Hoyer, BF, Voigt, C, Mumtaz, IM, Panne, D. Moser KV, Eilat D, Manz RA, RadbruchA, Hiepe F, manuscript submitted), allowing for filling of survival niches and development of a respective antibody repertoire and increase of blood serum immunoglobulin concentrations to adult plateau values. Plasma cells settling in such niches early in life apparently provide very persistent antibody levels, as illustrated by autoantibodies which arise in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) approximately 10 years before manifestation/diagnosis of the disease (e.g., anti-Ro, anti-La) [112] are especially hard to eradicate by therapy [37]. In adulthood, serum immunoglobulin levels remain overall constant and plasma cell niches are saturated. Consistently, only approximately splenic 3% of plasma cells formed within 2 months may become long-lived in old mice as compared with 20% in young mice within the same time period (Hoyer, Voigt, Radbruch, Hiepe et al., unpublished results). Hence, newly generated plasma cells induced within new, systemic immune responses compete with resident plasma cells for habitat. Newly acquired, long-lasting humoral immunity thus reflects successful competition and is accompanied by the stoichiometric loss of resident, polyclonal plasma cells [97, 113, 114]. In this regard, competition and subsequent mobilization of resident plasma cells might contribute to the slow decrease of antigen-specific titers for some antigens [104] (see later). Other, mutually nonexclusive mechanisms to maintain antigen-specific antibody titers may exist, i.e., homeostatic proliferation of mature plasma cells and continuous de novo generation of plasma cells from memory B cells activated in a bystander mode [94] or by a persistent antigen [93, 115]. More than 95% of BM plasma cells in adult humans do not perform cell division in terms of Ki-67 expression [114]. Therefore, homeostatic proliferation as a means to maintain the plasma cell population over the long term until old age cannot be excluded. Given that homeostatic plasma cell proliferation exists, again changes of the BM microenvironment might impact on antibody titers as a function of age. For the continuous generation of plasma cells from memory B cells, ageing could impact on the B cells\u2019 ability to be activated and to proliferate, as discussed in other sections of this chapter.",

Most of the studies observed changes in the composition of peripheral blood B cells of CD27-expressing memory B cells [120, 121] and CD27-non-expressing na\u00efve B cells dependent on age. From birth until adulthood, the proportion of memory B cells among total circulating B cells increases from approximately 4% in the cord blood to approximately 10% at 1 year of age in peripheral blood, until adult levels of approximately 30% to 50%, and the proportion increases further in aged individuals [71, 122\u2013124]. A generally larger variation of peripheral B cell composition was detected in old humans; however, it did not confirm the increase of the proportion of memory B cells with age [116]. Decreasing proportions of memory B cells with age were also observed [87]. It remains unclear to what degree B lymphopoiesis and na\u00efve B cell output to the periphery is affected by age in humans (see earlier). As most antigen-experienced \u201cmemory\u201d B cells do not recirculate but reside in lymphoid tissues such as spleen [96] or mucosal tissues [99], it remains unclear whether or not CD27+ B cell counts in peripheral blood reflect B cell memory as a whole. To this end, human tonsils contained constant proportions of memory B cells and plasma cells in 21 samples obtained from donors of different ages, maximum 73 years. At the same time, na\u00efve B cells were relatively enriched with ageing, with a concurrent reduction of germinal center B cells, which reached their minimum frequency at approximately 45 years, remaining constant afterwards [125].",

The loss of diversity correlated with a poorer health status and prospective mortality [126]. Peripheral blood CD19+ B cell VH family utilization was biased towards expression of VH4\u201334, VH3\u201323, VH1\u201369, VH4\u201359, and VH1\u20132 in elderly individuals, whereas VH3\u20139 was found solely in young individuals and VH3\u20137 was only expressed in the elderly [130]. Tonsillar B cells of the VH4 family did not show age-dependent changes in repertoire diversity [125], as did the circulating B cell repertoire of adult individuals who were analyzed twice, 9 years apart. In four out of five donors, no apparent changes in the VH family distribution were detected [131]. Human splenic germinal center accumulate antigen-selected B cells during ageing, as reflected by a higher mutational frequency and R/S ratio detected within CDR. The opposite effects were observed when analyzing germinal center B cells from young versus old Peyer\u2019s patches [132].",

The age-related impairment of secretory antibody responses was demonstrated further in senescent rats that showed reduced IgA+ plasma cell numbers in the intestinal lamina propria. Concurrently, IgA+ B cells in Peyer\u2019s patches accumulated to double the numbers of those in young animals, and fewer \u03b14\u03b27 integrin+ IgA+ plasmablasts were detected in blood circulation.

Differing from that, it was also hypothesized that not SHM but selection is impaired in aged individuals [156]. In nonimmunized mice, antibodies originating from plasma cells carrying mutated Ig rearrangements accumulate with age in the blood serum, indicating accumulation of mutations in the plasma cell compartment. This accumulation was partly independent on CSR, but was abrogated when mice were kept under germ-free conditions or in the absence of \u03b2/\u03b4 T cell receptors [157].",

Functional FDC impairment appears to be caused by reduced expression of Fc\u03b3 receptor II and slight reduction of complement receptor 1 and complement receptor 2 expression as well as the reduced presence or absence of immune-complex-containing vesicles (iccosomes) within FDC. Expression of FDC-M2, indicative of the capability of FDC to trap immune complexes, is also strongly reduced in aged mice [167].

In old mice as compared with young mice, fewer NP-specific IgG+ plasma cells were generated in the spleen after immunization with NP\u2013chicken \u03b3-globulin, and their numbers dropped to lower levels during the maintenance phase [170]. During the primary response in old mice, plasma cells failed to establish as efficiently in the BM as they did in young mice. Upon booster immunization, old mice also generated fewer plasma cells in the spleen and BM than young mice, but with significant increase in antibody-secreting cell numbers as compared with the primary response. Specific serum titers were also generated at tenfold lower levels in aged mice, and remained impaired also in a secondary vaccination with tenfold or greater reduction in old mice as compared with young mice. When VH186-2+ B cells indicative of antigen-specific B cells were analyzed, reduced accumulation of somatic mutations in aged mice was observed and old mice failed to select plasma cells with higher mutations into the BM [170]. Consistently, the spleen of aged mice harbors more antigen-specific low-affinity IgM+ plasma cells and fewer class-switched plasma cells. The BM contained decreased numbers of high- and low-affinity plasma cells in old mice as compared with young mice. Reconstituting old mice with splenocytes from young mice led to restoration of a young plasma cell response pattern in the spleen, but not the BM, reflecting the reduced capacity of the BM to recruit and maintain plasma cells [144]. Aged mice produced less frequently splenic foci containing specific B cells, and within these, fewer specific B cells (less than 50%) were observed after immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin\u2013phosphorylcholine (PC), reflecting operational but diminished antigen-specific B cell responses in old animals [171]. Old mice utilize atypical Ig genes in their plasma cells generated in immune responses to PC, Streptococcus pneumoniae R36a vaccine, and trinitrophenol [172\u2013174]. Such antibodies appear to be less protective, as demonstrated by loss of immune protection to pneumococcal infection of mice into which a PC-specific antibody generated in old mice was injected [173]. In contrast to results from vaccinations with haptens, the B cell response to influenza virus vaccination does not show an age-related decline in terms of specific B cell generation and repertoire diversity [175].",

Aged mice generated reduced numbers of splenic plasma cells which respond to another T-dependent antigen, and especially the numbers of those of IgG isotype and of high avidity were diminished. The transfer of spleen cells from old animals suppressed the generation of a regular plasma cell compartment in young mice upon immunization [176].",

The levels of IgG1 and IgG3 are often shown to be increased with age, whereas the level of IgG4 is reduced [15, 180\u2013184]. In old people, the level of soluble IgD has been shown to be significantly reduced to approximately 20% of that in young people [123, 185], whereas IgE levels remain unchanged [185]. Results differ in some details, e.g., the age at which significant differences in antibody levels can be detected and the magnitude of change. Although not determined specifically in old individuals, the physical in vivo half-life of both human and murine antibodies has been determined to be 3 weeks or less [186, 187], so age-related effects on antibody levels must occur at the level of plasma cell generation and persistence (see earlier). Stromal cells may fine-tune antibody secretion involving interactions of stromal-cell-derived CCL2 with CCR2 expressed by plasma cells [188]. Hence, senescent stromal cells [61] might impact on plasma cell homeostasis and antibody titers, as demonstrated in old mice being impaired in maintaining plasma cells [144]. The BM environment is further affected by osteoporosis and enlarging fat deposits at older age [189].",

Whereas for replicating antigens, i.e., viral specificities, antibody titer half-lives were virtually unchanged with age, those for protein antigens (tetanus and diphtheria toxoid) declined slowly with a half-life of more than 10 years, despite regular booster immunizations [104]. In line with these findings, anti-RSV IgG titers were undiminished in individuals at 70\u201380 years of age as compared with young controls at approximately 35 years of age, independent of frailty, whereas among US citizens older than 70 years, fewer than 30% had protective tetanus-specific IgG titers [190]. These specificity-related differences might arise from the different nature of the antigen and respective heterogeneity of immune activation in terms of timing, duration, antigen affinity, localization of the immune response, and replicating, sometimes persistent antigen acquired by natural infection versus nonreplicating, degradable antigen often applied by artificial challenge, i.e., vaccination.",

A similar phenomenon has been described in mice [198\u2013200]. Among centenarians, no further increase but a strong reduction of the prevalence of autoantibody-positive individuals was observed, e.g., for antithyroglobulin and anti- gastric parietal cell antibodies (PCA) antibodies, but not for RF [118, 201]. Differences have been noted between organ-specific and nonspecific autoantibodies with regard to their relation to the frailty of tested individuals. A screening of 148 European individuals at the age of 100 years revealed almost 80% of them expressed at least one autoantibody of 15 organ-specific and nonspecific autoantibodies tested, with the highest prevalence of IgM RF (26.6%). Autoantibodies did not reflect autoimmune disease, but organ-specific in contrast to nonspecific autoantibodies were rarely detected in individuals without comorbidities or disabilities. At least one organ-specific antibody was detected in 32% of the same cohort [118, 202], confirming the findings of earlier studies [181, 203]. Old individuals also display an increased usage of VH4 gene family members, which are enriched for rearrangements potentially leading to autoreactive antibodies [204], especially VH4\u201334, which has been found associated with cold agglutinin disease [130].",

Nevertheless autoantibodies can be detected 7\u20139 years before the onset of SLE, leaving it open to question whether the autoantibody-positive elderly are in the stage of \u201cbenign autoimmunity\u201d preceding overt disease [112]. Autoantibodies may arise as by-products of vaccine responses in mice [207] and humans [208, 209]. Transiently increased RF production was observed after tetanus and influenza booster vaccinations of normal healthy individuals [208, 209]. The relative increase in the underlying IgG reactive IgM+ B cell population correlated with the amounts of tetanus toxoid specific IgG measured in blood serum [208] and was more profound than the vaccination induced IgM-RF production measured in the blood serum. A role for CD5+ B cells within autoantibody production appears to be implicated as peritoneal cavity CD5+ B1 cells have been shown to be a source of IgM RF [210]. The development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which occurs at rather old age, often shows a CD5+ phenotype [204]. However, the numbers of CD5+ B cells become reduced with age in peripheral blood [118, 124].",

Besides reactivation of thymic activity [221, 223], treatment leads to eradication of peripheral blood B cells and subsequent establishment of a circulating B cell population that mostly (approximately 90%) consists of na\u00efve B cells at 1\u20135 years after ASCT. Beside proteasome inhibition, e.g. using Bortezomib, immunoablation with rabbit antithymocyte globulin plus ASCT is also the only known treatment to eradicate plasma cells and consequently specific antibody and autoantibody production. Immunoablation/ASCT treatment targets both the pathogenic and protective immune cells and thus patients carry a high risk of suffering from sometimes fatal infections.",

Salivary secretory IgA levels are significantly increased after 1 h of choir singing [227] and are further influenced by emotional state [228] and mental exercise [229]. The impact of nutrition and drug consumption has been described [230], but not always confirmed [231]. Caloric restriction is associated with longer life span in mouse models [232].
