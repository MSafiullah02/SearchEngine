They are responsible not only for the recurrent epidemics but also for occasional pandemics due to major changes in antigenicity (as a result of mixing the segmented genome of two parent viruses of different origin, also called \u201cantigenic shift\u201d) leading up to half a million of people to death every year [1]. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, due to the emergence of a new influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] [2], Greece experienced two waves of transmission, where 294 patients received intensive care treatment and 149 patients died [3, 4]. In post-pandemic season 2010\u201311, pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was by far the most commonly detected virus (97,5% in Greece) resulting to 368 admissions to intensive-care units (ICUs) and 180 deaths in Greece [5, 6].",

Disease severity is usually associated with a plethora of host factors such as age (> 65), pregnancy, obesity, and underlying medical conditions including pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease, chronic metabolic disorder (including diabetes mellitus) or immunosuppression [9]. Moreover, the risk of a secondary bacterial pneumonia commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae is a key complication of influenza virus infection particularly in the elderly [10]. Notably, in the recent pandemic of 2009, 65% (80% of the respiratory and cardiovascular deaths) of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 deaths worldwide were in individuals aged 18\u201364 years [11], whereas people over 65 years of age tended to have milder symptoms probably due to cross-protective immunity induced by previous H1N1 influenza infection or vaccination [12].",

These determinants are mainly the essential virulence of the virus, the acquired host immunity and the inheritable host factors whose importance in severity determination is only recently being underscored and granted major attention, especially after the emergence of the 2009 pandemic [13, 14]. The keystone that triggered studies on innate host factors was the observation of increased death rate among young adults and children without known risk factor mentioned before [15]. Using the genealogic database of families of Utah between 1904 and 2004, Albright et al. documented a significant association of influenza-associated death risk within families underlying the inherited predisposition of susceptibility to severe influenza infection [16]. In view of the contradictory results obtained by a second epidemiological study in Iceland with substantially smaller sample size [17], further investigation is needed to reveal the role of host genetic factors in the severity of influenza infections.",

Similarly, a number of recent studies, using different strategies (genome-wide screens, proteomics or transcriptomics approaches, etc.) both in humans and in animal models, aim to reproduce and validate candidate genes retrieved mainly from genetic association studies that predispose to severe influenza [21\u201323]. Genetic polymorphisms vary among different individuals in each population and usually involve the substitution of a single nucleotide (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP). Although the estimated SNP frequency within the human genome was about one SNP per 1000 base pairs, which corresponds to 3 million SNPs in total [24, 25], the international HapMap project reported about 10 million SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5% [26]. The different SNPs may affect in diverse ways the produced protein, and thus the phenotype, depending on their location: within a coding or non-coding sequence.",

The samples were collected between January and February of the post-pandemic influenza period 2010\u201311 from 23 state hospitals and two Social Insurance Institutes (IKAs) from northern Greece. Moreover, to achieve uniformity in our study groups the following exclusion criteria were set: patients older than 60 years, other than Greek, or preexisting comorbidities in accordance to WHO risk factors. The demographic and clinical features of the study participants are shown in Table 1. The ethical approval of this study has been provided by the \u201cBioethics Committee of the Medical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\u201d (protocol approval number 432).",

Similarly, allelic odds ratios of CD55 rs2564978, C1QBP rs3786054 and FCGR2A rs1801274 revealed no differences in risk associated with influenza severity. The same analysis was carried out to uncover the genetic association between the three SNPs studied and the mortality risk. Indeed, minor allele homozygote patients of the CD55 rs2564978 presented 8.3 times increased risk (P = 0.026, OR 8.344, 95% CI 1.290\u201353.957) in fatal outcome than the major allele homozygotes plus heterozygotes under the recessive genetic model. The risk was further increased to 10.5-fold (P = 0.043, OR 10.500, 95% CI 1.062\u2013103.788) when comparing the difference in odds between minor allele homozygotes vs major allele homozygotes. Additionally, under the allelic model of comparison, the patients carrying the T allele presented about 2.3 times increased risk (P = 0.031, OR 0.437, 95% CI 0.206\u20130.927) in fatal outcome compared to the patients with the C allele. Regarding C1QBP rs3786054, when comparing the major allele homozygotes GG with the minor allele homozygotes AA and heterozygotes AG under the dominant genetic model, the latter were found significantly associated with increased risk of mortality by threefold (P = 0.032, OR 3.162, 95% CI 1.102\u20139.072). This finding was further supported by the significant increase in odds of dying if harboring the minor allele A than the major allele G (P = 0.026, OR 0.432, 95% CI 0.206\u20130.904). In contrast, there was no significant difference in odds regarding the FCGR2A rs1801274 polymorphism under any genetic model examined.

Indeed, in our study, the mean age of fatal cases was 48.21 years, while the mean ages of mild and severe cases with fatal outcome were 52.67 and 47.37 years, respectively. Another important issue to be highlighted is the very low vaccination rate in general population, although the influenza vaccination was offered for free in Greece. The vaccination coverage of our study population, which does not include high-risk groups, was 6.4%, a relatively low rate, but in accordance with the general population which was 5.9% that year [5].

The TT genotype of rs2564978, that results in reduced promoter activity [29], is relatively rare in Europe (7%) according to the 1000 Genomes project data source and was found in only 4.5% of our overall patients (Table 3). However, there was a significant overrepresentation of the TT genotype in fatal cases that reached 15.8% (P = 0.030), and only 2.2% in survivors. Similar observation was seen by comparing the minor allele T distribution, since it was 36.8% in fatal cases vs 20.3% in non-fatal cases of our patient group. The resulted reduced expression of CD55 in patients carrying the rare TT genotype may lead to more robust complement activation during infection, resulting in worse outcomes secondary to enhanced inflammation [23]. Similarly, the death risk association was found significantly increased by more than eightfold in fatal cases (P = 0.026, OR 8.344, 95% CI 1.290\u201353.957), a result that is rather overestimated because of the small sample size in our study. Consistent with our findings, a recent study in Spain indirectly associated rs2564978 with influenza severity (P = 0.0064, OR 7.11, 95% CI 1.400\u201336.00) [39]. These findings are in accordance with those of Zhou and colleagues [29] that first described the significant association of the TT genotype with severe influenza infection (P = 0.011, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.13\u20132.70) in Chinese patients based on a small-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). Recently, a second study from China did not find any significant association between rs2564978 and the primary outcome in cases of avian (H7N9) or pandemic influenza, but TT genotype was linked to severity [40]. The fact that the TT genotype in East Asian populations is much more prevalent than in the rest of the world (35% vs 7%) according to the 1000 Genomes project data source, underlies the importance of this polymorphism in influenza severity and further attention is needed. Our study is the first presenting a positive correlation between fatal outcome and the TT genotype and this finding needs to be confirmed in a bigger cohort.",

            "text": "Apart from CD55, the study also focused on the association of host genetic polymorphisms with influenza severity of another protein related to complement cascade, since its role in viral defense is well established. The C1QBP gene encodes for a protein that binds to C1q molecule, a component known as an important regulator of antiviral antibody effector mechanisms of the classical pathway of complement activation, and thus inhibiting C1 [41]. C1QBP rs3786054 was one of the four SNPs (together with FCGR2A rs1801274, an unknown gene rs9856661 and RPAIN rs8070740) identified as significant risk factors on the severity of influenza infection in a case\u2013control genetic association study in Mexican population. A threefold increase in risk of severe disease (P < 0.0001, OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.89\u20135.17) was found for patients homozygous for the minor allele [22]. Although we did not find any significant association of the rare AA genotype with severity in any genetic model studied, we found a threefold increased risk of death in dominant genetic model for the major G-allele (P = 0.032, OR 3.162, 95% CI 1.102\u20139.072). Moreover, the frequency of the rare AA genotype was significantly increased from 4.6% in all patients to 10.5% in patients who died. Additionally, the allele distribution of the minor allele A was also significantly (P = 0.038) increased in fatal cases (39.5%) as compared to non-fatal cases (22%). Unlikely, the association of rs3786054 with influenza severity could not be replicated in a recent GWAS [39] and thus in view of the contradictory results observed in different disease association studies, further research is required to clarify the role of this genetic polymorphism.",

            "text": "Another polymorphism, namely the rs1801274 on FCGR2A gene, was reported as candidate risk association factor in a study from Mexico [22]. The nonsynonymous A/G polymorphism rs1801274 causes an amino acid substitution at position 131 (His131Arg), which is known to affect the affinity of the FCGR2A for different subtypes of IgG [42]. The effector cells of AA homozygous individuals bind stronger to IgG2 resulting to more effective antigen clearance [43]. The enhanced host immune response might be the cause of severe disease outcome of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection, taking into account that protein encoded by FCGR2A participates in the clearing of immune complexes [22, 23]. Zuniga and colleagues reported a significant increase of minor allele frequency in severe cases compared with control group (36% and 13%, respectively) as well as increased risk of association (P < 0.0001, OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.69\u20134.25) with severity. However, these results do not concur with our findings regarding either the presence of pneumonia or the risk of mortality where no association was established under any genetic model tested. In accordance with our findings, a recent study from Brazil failed to reveal any differences in allele or genotype frequencies of the rs1801274 polymorphism and its association with influenza disease severity or death (P > 0.05) [44]. Moreover, the association of rs1801274 with influenza severity was not even indirectly replicated in a European GWAS where more than half a million SNPs were investigated [39]. Probably the false discovery rate of 36% for rs1801274 in the study of Zuniga and colleagues, [22] because of the small size of the study, misled them to positive results. The main drawbacks of current studies is either the small sample size and/or the inability of generating compared groups for age, sex, ethnicity without confounding underlying medical conditions that question the importance of the findings and the overall polymorphism implication.",

To eliminate ethnicity stratification that is an important confounding factor in genetic association studies, only Greek ethnicity patients were enrolled. Further, our study is restricted to patients without previous known influenza comorbidities, and cases were diagnosed with pneumonia. Such study design led to the inclusion of only 110 cases for further genotyping out of 810 cases examined. Our results show that two independent complement-related SNPs, namely the rare TT genotype of CD55 as well as the rare AA genotype of C1QBP are associated with increased death risk, but not with the disease severity based on the stratification sample criteria applied. No significant differences were observed for FCGR2A genotypes. Genotype distributions of all three SNPs investigated were consistent with Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium and their MAFs were in accordance to those reported for European populations in the 1000 Genomes project data source. Since all patients in our study had no other risk factors, our findings could lead to the identification of population groups at genetic risk. Additional genetic association studies could support our findings to the identification of new at-risk populations to whom the implementation of vaccination will help prevent influenza infection and its implications. Furthermore, their early recognition will reduce the financial burden due to less hospitalization.",
