Heterocyclic Noxides have applications in synthetic organic chemistry, chemotherapy and agrochemicals. Synthesis of Noxides using green oxidants will be attractive over the conventional methods. The presence of the N-oxide group in the azine ring makes it more subject to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack and substantially expands the synthetic approaches for the modification of nitrogen-containing heterocyclics. That is the reason for the increasing interest in the chemistry of heterocyclic N-oxides. Some reactions adopted for oxidation of N-heterocyclics have been discussed. Stereochemical and spectroscopic aspects have been mentioned. It will be advantageous if anchored catalysts are employed for industrial exploitation. Several physiochemical aspects of various methods have been discussed.",

            "text": "Oxidative reactions are among the most important transformations in synthetic chemistry [1] and offer important methodology for the introduction and modification of functional groups [2] . Environmentally benign and sustainable transformations in organic chemistry are now considered to be basic goals and requirements in the development of modern organic synthesis. To fulfill these goals, reactions should have high atom efficiency along with the use of solvents which are environmentally friendly and be free from dangerous waste. These requirements have led to the introduction of mainly homogeneous liquid phase catalysis into the arena of organic chemistry. During the last two decades there has been a spectacular development in the field and a large number of novel and useful oxidation reactions have been discovered leading to a range of selective and mild processes. These reactions are based on organo-catalysis, metal-catalysis or bio-catalysis. Conventional stoichiometric oxidations using nitric acid, chromic acid and their derivatives, alkyl hydroperoxides, permanganate, osmium tetraoxide, and peracids often suffer from high costs, formation of toxic waste or low atom efficiency, providing a strong incentive to develop sustainable catalytic alternatives [3, 4] . Homogeneous oxidation catalyst would find more widespread technological application if suitably anchored versions are available. Immobilization of a homogeneous oxidation catalyst often greatly enhances its lifetime because of the suppression of bimolecular deactivation. Moreover, unprecedented activities and selectivities may be observed, surpassing the performances of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst. Hence we present a green view of the oxidation of N-heterocyclics.",

            "text": "Compounds containing the N-oxide functionality, where the nitrogen is bound to an unsaturated carbon, have been known for more than a century [9] . Since then the chemistry of N-oxides has become extensive and numerous reactions and methods of preparation have been reported [10] . The chemistry and various applications of heterocyclic N-oxides have attracted many to find methods which follow the postulates of green chemistry. Biological importance of heterocyclic N-oxides is well documented [11] . The pyridine N-oxide derivatives represent a peculiar class of antiviral compound which are promising novel drugs in HIV chemotherapy. Some members exclusively act through inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and thus characteristically behave as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These compounds have a possible role in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis [12] . A wide variety of pyridine N-oxide derivatives have been found to be inhibitory against feline coronavirus (FIPV strain) and human SARS-CoV (Frankfurt strain-1) in CRFK and simian kidney (Vero) cell cultures, respectively [13] . Their use as protecting groups, auxiliary agents, oxidants, ligands in metal complexes [14] [15] , for rate enhancement of transition metal catalyzed processes [16] , make them very important tool in organic synthesis. Pyridine N-oxides serve as useful oxygen atom transfer agent for alkyl halides [17] and they have been used routinely in the synthesis of high-valent transition-metal and actinide oxo complexes [18] [19] [20] [21] . N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide is used as a reoxidant in the Upjohn procedure for the osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation [22] . Pyridine N-oxides are important as synthetic intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The antiulcer agent omeprazole is produced from 2,3,5-trimethylpyridine N-oxide. Niflumic acid and Pranoprofen are analgesics and antiinflammatories, which are manufactured from nicotinic acid N-oxide, obtained either by N-oxidation of nicotinic acid or by hydrolysis of 3-pyridinecarbonitrile N-oxide. Zinc pyrithione, the zinc salt of 2-pyridinethiol N-oxide, is a fungicide derived from 2-chloropyridine N-oxide [23] . Only recently the donor behaviour of pyridine Noxides has been successfully harnessed for nucleophillic catalysis [24] . C-H activation by pyridine N-oxide with uranium (IV) and thorium (IV) bis(alkyl) complexes have also been reported [25] . Immobilization on pyridine Noxide resins is also reported recently [26] . Theoretical investigations of the N-oxide moiety [27] leading to calculation of linear and non linear optical properties [28] , molecular and electric properties [29] , have also been carried out. Interestingly, in the nanotechnology field, it has been shown that nanoshampo including carboxylic acid pyridine N-oxide is a very powerful hair growth stimulator with a high level of safety [30] . The N-oxides of isoquinolines have been proved to be excellent intermediates for the preparation of many compounds.",

Nitration of pyridine N-oxide is a typical electrophilic reaction of the Noxide. Owing to the contribution of resonance structures 4 and 5, the oxygen atom of the N-oxide group readily undergoes protonation, acylation, allylation, etc.",

Most of these suffer from drawbacks such as the use of stoichiometric amount of corrosive acids or toxic metallic compounds those generate undesirable waste [49] . Technology is called \"green\" if it uses raw materials efficiently, such that the use of toxic and hazardous reagents and solvents can be avoided while formation of waste or undesirable by-products is minimized [50a,b,c,d] Catalytic routes often satisfy these criteria. According to Sheldon, the best solvent is no solvent, but if a solvent is unavoidable, then water is a very good candidate [50e]. Sheldon introduced several indicators to measure the efficiency and environmental impact of a reaction. The atom efficiency is the molecular weight of the desired product divided by the total molecular weight of all products. The environmental acceptability of a reaction is expressed in terms of E factor-the weight of waste or undesirable byproduct divided by the weight of the desired product. To assess the environmental impact of the waste generated, Sheldon introduced the environmental quotient, EQ as the E factor multiplied by an unfriendliness quotient, Q, which is assigned a value to indicate how undesirable a byproduct is. Waste prevention is much to be preferred over waste remediation. Environmentally benign oxidants like hydrogen peroxide, molecular oxygen, BSTP {bis-(trimethylsilyl)peroxide}, dioxiranes are to be used in particular for non environmental impacts. mCPBA {metachloroperoxybenzoic acid} seems to be the most common oxidant for most pyridines, but is not reliable for electron deficient pyridines. Hydrogen peroxide on the other hand gives only water as the byproduct and makes the work up easy. Molecular oxygen is an attractive oxidant and development of synthetic methodologies using it as the sole oxidant is a rewarding goal both from environmental and economic points of view [51] .",

The redox titanium catalyst {TS-1 (titanium silicate), Ti-ZSM-5(30), Ti-MCM-41} was supported on molecular sieves:ZSM-5 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 =30), MCM-41. The Ti-ZSM-5(30) was synthesized by post-synthetic modification of HZSM-5 (30) . TS-1 was prepared according to the procedure reported in the literature. The use of redox metals like titanium, iron, vanadium, and chromium is of advantage as they provide shape selective oxidation properties. The structured Silica (Ti-MCM-41) offer great advantage over modified Silica gels because the former can be shape selective. The aqueous or methanol medium made the reaction very attractive and eco-friendly. A large number of substrates, pyridines, substituted pyridines, picolines, halo-pyridines, cyano-pyridines, vinyl-pyridines, and pyrazines were subjected to oxidation. Routine characterization with, solid state NMR, XRD, IR were used for characterization of the catalyst. Product analysis was done with 1 H NMR, FT-IR, Mass spectroscopy, melting point. The high activity of TS-1 is due to the large number of site isolated titanium active centers per unit volume. Water is the only byproduct. Ti-ZSM-5 (30) catalyst showed good yields for electron-donating groups. Pyrazines formed both mono-N-oxide and N,N-dioxide because of the small pore size of zeolites. Turn over number of the catalyst has not been mentioned. The catalyst can be recycled and reused for specified number of runs. The focus has been on quantitative yields. Punniyamurthy et. al studied the N-oxidation of tertiary amines over silica supported vanadium catalyst (V x Si 4x O 6.4x ) with 30% hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant [62] . The catalyst prepared was recyclable and was reused without loss of activity. one of the largest anions known for the potential application as catalyst. The heteropolyacid has the advantages like strong Bronsted acidity with 14 acidic protons, high thermal stability, high hydrolytic stability, safety, separability, corrosiveness, high oxidation potential, and greenness [63] . The position of COOH group in nicotinic, picolinic, quniolic acids plays an important role in the product type. The catalyst can be recycled due to the non degradation in the structure of Preyssler's anion. The catalyst is very much active in the biphasic system (hydrogen peroxide: non polar solvent and Preyssler's catalyst), and oxidizes pyridinecarboxylic acids to the corresponding pyridine N oxides with decarboxylation at 2-position. The substrate type, solvent and reaction time as well as catalyst type are important factors. The solvents used were toluene, benzene and carbon tetrachloride.",

They reported the first kinetic data for the N-oxidation [ Scheme 8] . The reaction was found to be first order with respect to each of the reagents; second order overall. The Hammett plot of the substituted pyridines yielded an excellent fit with sigma values with a rho of -2.91 \u00b1 0.13 (r = 0.995). The rho value is in agreement with that previously reported in the Hammett study of substituted pyridine Noxidation by peroxybenzoic acid ( = -2.35, 25\u00b0C) in 50:50 dioxane/water [65] . The effect of solvent polarity on the oxidation of {X = 4-CF 3 in (Scheme-8)} by dimethyldioxirane was studied under pseudo first order conditions at 23\u00b0C. Here again preferential N-oxidations (when the substrate contains olefinic or aldehydic group) was observed. Polar, protic solvents significantly enhanced the rate of N-oxidation. The oxidation of substituted pyridines occurs via an SN 2 mechanism, rather than an electron transfer. The costs of dioxiranes need to be kept in mind while using it as the oxidant.",
