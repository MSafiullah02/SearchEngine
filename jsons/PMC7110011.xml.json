However, because of the complex nature of viral populations, the consensus sequence may not exist in the actual viral quasispecies. The raw electropherograms produced by Sanger sequencing may also provide qualitative information of the variability at each position of the analyzed sequence. Nonetheless, this methodology may fail in detecting minor nucleotide variants and their distribution among the genomes comprising the viral population. Thus, although Sanger sequencing has been an irreplaceable tool in virology studies, the large complexity of RNA viruses can only be studied with technology capable of assessing the sub-consensus variants. Indeed, for several years, researchers have accomplished the study of quasispecies complexity and dynamics with nucleotide sequences from a limited number of cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments [5]. More recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has proved to be an efficient and affordable method to shed light into the high complexity of viral samples [6\u20138]. In addition, new computational tools have opened the opportunity to reconstruct genome populations from a complex mixture of short viral sequences [9\u201311]. Undoubtedly, these technological advances will help us to increase our current understanding of viral quasispecies composition and evolution [12, 13].",

Basically, it is an extension to the FASTA format where each nucleotide in a sequence has a numeric quality score associated to it.

FastQC is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data that provides a modular set of analyses to perform control checks. Next, a conservative approach to follow would be to filter all reads with a highly restrictive phred value to decrease the amount of information available. Alternatively, a less restrictive quality threshold can be chosen but this would retrieve many erroneously called bases in the dataset and, therefore, more false positive variant calls [16].

The input file for LoFreq is the sorted BAM file (Figure 1) and, as most variant callers, the software outputs a VCF file [28] (Supplementary file 1, line 78). This particular file reports all the relevant information, in a tab-delimited structure, for each detected variant, including allele frequencies, raw depth in that position, filter-passed flags and the estimated error of the call, among others. Any text editor or spreadsheet software available allows the inspection of the VCF file. Additionally, the tab-delimited structure allows the annotation of each variant in a VCF file with a new column that provides information of interest. It is highly recommendable to compress and index the files before performing this step (Supplementary file 1, lines 87 and 89). Moreover, SnpEff software [29] can be used to annotate the VCF files in order to determine the impact of a detected variant on the sequence (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous, non-coding) (Figure 1). Accordingly, this step adds a new column on the VCF file with the predicted impact on the genome. This software requires a database of the corresponding reference sequence. This database can be constructed following the user\u2019s manual, if not already available as part of the default databases loaded in the source distribution.",

This program requires FASTA format files as input. Thus, filtered and trimmed FASTQ files must be converted to FASTA with a proper software, such as Seqtk (Figure 1) [31]. In this workflow, however, we recommend to extract the reads directly from the BAM file, in order to use the same input data for all reconstruction software (Supplementary file 1, line 108).

A quality drop occurred in all samples towards the 3\u00b4 end of the reads (Supplementary Figure 1b). Accordingly, reads were trimmed below a quality score of q30 and adapter-trimmed using BBDuk [18]. Additionally, all reads with an average quality score below q30 and under 50 bases were discarded.

First, we assessed the capability of these programs to reconstruct known quasispecies samples. For this purpose, we constructed artificial viral populations using real data from two datasets of reads obtained from FMDV viruses derived from four cell passages of two FMDV molecular clones, namely A01Lc and CapLc (GenBank accession numbers MK341545 and MK341544, respectively). The consensus sequences of these two viruses differ in 10 positions across 1300 nt in the coding region of non-structural protein 2C. Both datasets were randomly sampled and mixed to obtain three artificial quasispecies with different proportions of reads: 50/50, 70/30 and 90/10 of A01Lc/CapLc, respectively. The total number of reads of mixed populations was 40 000. Next, the artificial viral populations were used as probe samples for haplotype reconstruction using the three programs included in this guide. Different combinations of parameters were assessed for each software to reach optimal performance. For instance, homopolymeric error rate and non-homopolymeric error rate were used for QuRe, whereas minimum expected haplotype frequency (tf) and minimum number of reads were used to support a haplotype (t) for CliqueSNV. In the case of ViQuaS, we used minimum number of reads needed to call a base during an extension (r) and minimum base ratio to accept an overhang consensus base (o). The total number of reconstructed haplotypes (frequency >1%) and the number of true positive haplotypes (i.e. haplotypes showing at most one mutation with regard to the closest variant) were recorded and used to calculate recall (true positive haplotypes/expected number of haplotypes) and precision (true positive haplotypes/total number of haplotypes reconstructed) of the reconstruction algorithms [11]. Recall and precision were calculated to assess the performance of the different parameters evaluated for each program.",

For instance, during retrotranscription (RT) and PCR, sequence errors may occur because of primer mismatches, low polymerase fidelity and in vitro recombination. This hinders the identification of viral variants, especially those of low frequency (rare variants) [41]. In this context, several researchers have designed specialized bioinformatics tools to identify the true viral variants and discard false positive mutations [27, 41, 42]. Thus, the validation of true SNVs relies heavily on the methodology used and the analysis performed. The distinction between true variants and technical noise is a challenging step during data analysis. A conservative approach for an SNV caller would constraint the sensitivity limit, whereas a less restrictive threshold would result in poor precision. Hence, the detection of SNVs of low frequency requires high sensitivity and precision of the call method [43]. In this sense, LoFreq accurately calls variants occurring in less than 0.05% of a population, with high-quality (40) and high-coverage (over 10000\u00d7) sequencing data [27].",

[27] estimated a frequency threshold of true variants of 0.2\u20130.3%. Instead, we used a more conservative frequency threshold of 1% to consider an SNV as a true variant. In our datasets, samples A01L, A01NL and A01Lc showed 135, 92 and 10 SNVs above this limit, respectively. This result demonstrates the potential of this workflow to detect SNVs with a wide range of frequencies (1 to 100 %).",

Moreover, these two clones displayed this low variability even with the amplification and sequencing steps known as error sources. The level of variability detected from these cloned samples may be used as a control to estimate the local error rate and improve true variant detection by tuning software parameters more accurately [43]. In fact, other researchers have previously proposed the use of monoclonal strains as a tool for estimating the background noise [44, 45]. Alternatively, some authors have suggested using two, or more, independent sequencing runs of the same sample and, then, considering as valid only SNVs that appear in all the runs [35]. Furthermore, if the detection of rare variants is mandatory, the sensitivity of the computational methods can be improved by detecting and reducing errors during amplification and library preparation [43]. In this sense, several groups have developed approaches such as CirSeq and primerIDs to improve data quality from an experimental design perspective [46\u201348].",

This was evidenced by the diverse number of haplotypes detected in FMDV samples displaying different degrees of variability (A01L, A01NL and A01Lc), even by using programs with different haplotype reconstruction methods. Remarkably, for A01L, the frequency of the SNVs present in the reconstructed quasispecies from QuRe software best correlated with the frequency of the SNVs detected by LoFreq (Supplementary Figure 4).

This drawback makes it still unsuitable for the characterization of intra-sample virus heterogeneity or of accurate quasispecies composition.
