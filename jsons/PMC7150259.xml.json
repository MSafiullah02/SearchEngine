Comprehensive surveillance of morbidity and mortality for dozens of conditions has since been well established in the United States and in other industrialized countries. However, despite the clear need for epidemiological data to inform health policies, reliable and comprehensive health statistics are not available in many developing countries. International efforts to assess and monitor the burden of certain diseases have been limited in the past to a small number of infectious diseases in the context of global eradication programs \u2013 smallpox, poliomyelitis, guinea worm, and, more recently, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian flu influenza A (H5N1).",

It created a common metric, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to estimate morbidity and mortality for eight regions that collectively span the world\u2019s population, generating comparable information on incidence and prevalence in global health. However, patterns of disease, disability, and risk factors have since changed significantly and new data on their distribution are available. Furthermore, the unprecedented money and attention now pouring into international health has made an accurate assessment of global health patterns a matter of utmost urgency. The new Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD 2005) project, which began in 2007, represents the first major effort at a systematic revision of estimates in health for every region in the world comprehensively, and will ensure that that the global health community bases its research and policies on complete, valid, and reliable information. Burden of disease estimates provided in this article are for 2001 \u2013 the year for which the most recent estimates of the global burden of disease and risk factors are currently available.",

Accordingly, estimates of the global burden of infectious diseases are provided in the context of the overall burden from other conditions, diseases, and injuries. The relative importance of the burden of infectious diseases was forecasted to change by 2020. As the epidemiological transition progresses worldwide, a decline in the burden of infectious diseases is expected as the burden of noncommunicable diseases and injuries gradually increases. The pace of the epidemiological transition, however, varies greatly among regions so that the projected decreases in the burden of infectious diseases are expected to vary between regions. Trends in the global burden due to specific infectious diseases projected to 2020 also vary among specific conditions. The global burden of HIV/AIDS, for instance, is expected to greatly increase, whereas the global burden due to respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases is expected to decrease. Contrary to expectations, the global burden of malaria has increased in recent years.",

            "text": "The selection of the classification scheme to represent mortality by cause for the GBD was driven by the intent to provide information that would be useful for the health policy debate. The challenge was to strike the proper balance between too little and too much detail in the selection of the final list of causes. At the simplest end of the spectrum, cause of death can be aggregated in just three categories: infectious and parasitic diseases, chronic diseases, and injuries. This level of aggregation, however, would not be useful to inform the choice of specific health priorities or to assess the potential to improve survival through specific intervention strategies. At the other end of the spectrum, an overly detailed list of causes would make cross-national and intertemporal comparisons difficult to interpret. Accordingly, the classification adopted follows a tree structure of causes of death. At the first level of disaggregation, overall mortality was divided into three broad groups: group I (infectious diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), group II (noncommunicable diseases), and group III (injuries). Each group was further subdivided into several major subcategories. All infectious diseases were included under the first two major subcategories of group I: infectious and parasitic diseases (IA) and respiratory infections (IB). Other group I subcategories are maternal conditions (IC), perinatal conditions (ID), and nutritional conditions (IE). Group II was subdivided into 14 subcategories \u2013 e.g., cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Group III was subdivided into two categories \u2013 intentional injuries and nonintentional injuries. Each second-level category was further disaggregated into two levels that include a total of 107 individual causes, such as HIV, lung cancer, or motor-vehicle accidents. Table 1 provides the detailed classification used in the GBD for infectious diseases.\n",

Overall, the burden of neuropsychiatric conditions is almost the same for both sexes, but major contributing causes are quite distinct.

The following major recommendations for public health policy were derived from the GBD:1.The magnitude of the remaining burden due to infectious diseases in developing countries, despite the sustained efforts to reduce child mortality during the past few decades, underscore the need for lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B and C to remain a key priority for global public health action.2.Although the high mortality due to infectious diseases in developing countries was already well known, the finding that deaths from two major cardiovascular causes (ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease) were the second and third leading cause of death in LMICs was a significant surprise. Also noteworthy was the finding that deaths from road traffic accidents were among the top ten causes in all regions. The major implication of these findings is that they need to be included in the international public health policy debate.3.It is essential to include the burden of nonfatal health outcomes in the global assessment of health problems because it notoriously shifts the ranking of priorities. The burden of neuropsychiatric conditions and sexually transmitted diseases had been greatly underestimated.4.Although some diseases and injuries occur without prior exposure to health hazards, review of the contribution of one or more major risk factor for respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases illustrates the importance of exposures that underlie major infectious diseases mostly in developing countries. Their control must remain a priority. In the absence of sustained efforts to improve hygiene and sustained vigilance about emerging infections and novel pandemics, forecasts about the pace of the epidemiological transition from a predominance of infectious diseases to a predominance of chronic conditions may well be self-negated. It has been well documented that average improvement in GNP per capita does not always translate into good health for all.5.Evidence-based health policy formulation will require regular updates of global and regional information to better monitor trends for planning purposes.\n",

            "text": "\ndisability-adjusted life year (DALY)The measurement unit that was developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study. The DALY is a time-based measure, and thus a form of QALY, in which the value choices have been standardized. The DALY is one lost year of healthy life. It captures in a single indicator the impact of both premature death and nonfatal health outcomes of diseases and injuries. DALYs from a condition are the sum of years lost to premature death and years lived with a disability adjusted for the severity of the disability. The DALY incorporates explicit and transparent value choices for the duration of life lost, the value of life lived at different ages, comparison time lived with a disability with time lost due to mortality, and time preference. It is built on the principle that only two characteristics of individuals that are not directly related to their health \u2013 their age and sex \u2013 should be taken into consideration when calculating the burden of a given health outcome in that individual, whereas socioeconomic status, race, and education are not considered. Time lived with a disability and time lost to premature death are age weighted to reflect the greater social role played by adults in caring and providing for the young and the old. Time has been discounted at 3% so that a year lost in the future is less valuable than a year lost today. The use of nonuniform age weights that give less weight to years lived at younger and older ages has been the most contentious social value incorporated in the GBD 1990, and has been dropped in the revised estimates of the global burden of disease for 2001, which applies uniform age weights (DALY 3,0).quality-adjusted life year (QALY)A time-based measure that incorporates judgments about the value of time spent in different health states. Since the late 1940s, researchers have generally agreed that time is an appropriate currency: time (in years) lost through premature death and time (in years) lived with a disability. The term QALY does not imply any specific value choices or methods used to elicit preferences for health states. A range of such time-based measures have been developed in different countries.years lived with a disability (YLD)Years lived with a disability of known severity and duration. Although death is clearly defined, disability is not. It is difficult to define because nonfatal health outcomes differ from each other in their causes, name, nature, impact on the individual, and the way in which the surrounding community responds. To compare different disabilities, time lived with various short-, medium-, and long-term disabilities is weighed by a severity weight that is based on the measurement of social value preferences for time lived in various health states. Severity weights range from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (equivalent to death). Two methods were used to formalize social preferences for different states of health. Both ask people to make trade-offs between quantity and quality of life. Results of time trade-off exercises showed a surprisingly wide agreement between cultures on what constitutes a severe or mild disability. For example, a year lived with blindness appears to most people as more severe than a year lived with watery diarrhea but less severe than a year lived with quadriplegia.years of life lost (YLL)A year lost due to premature death, defined as a death occurring before the age to which the person could have expected to survive if he or she were a member of a standardized model population with a life expectancy at birth equal to one of the world\u2019s longest surviving populations (Japan), or 82.5 years for female and 80 years for males.\n",
