To protect us against these constant challenges, our lungs have defenses that are remarkably effective, biologically complex, and scientifically fascinating. It is not hyperbole to say that the pathogenesis of most lung disease begins with a breach of these defenses. This chapter surveys these normal lung defense systems. Just as this text assumes familiarity with general pathology, we also assume knowledge of basic immunology. This chapter emphasizes the lung's variations on themes of innate and adaptive immunity, and discusses the special role of granulomatous inflammation in lung defenses.",

A first realization is that lung defense systems must cope with a staggering volume of air. The volume of air inhaled by the average person can be estimated as 10,000 L per day or 400 million liters per lifetime. 1 This volume ensures exposure to infectious and toxic agents, even if present in the air at quite low concentrations. There are three major categories of potentially injurious agents that merit attention: pathogens, particles, and toxic gases.",

The latter illustrates well the general capacity of lung defenses for effective clearance of small inocula of organisms, especially those of low to moderate virulence. We must recall that there normally is abundant colonization of the nasopharynx by a complex ecology of microorganisms that can include pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae in up to 10% of normal adults.2 Importantly, numerous studies have documented that nocturnal aspiration of small volumes of these secretions is a normal occurrence? These secretions (e.g., saliva) contain an estimated 10 8 anaerobes and 10 6 aerobes per milliliter, as well as pneumococci and other pathogens (depending on colonization status). The general absence of infection despite this daily dose of bacteria is a testimonial to the efficacy of lung defenses. For inhalation exposures, quantitative culture data show that ambient air contains variable, albeit generally low, levels of bacteria and fungi.4 It must be recognized, of course, that the systems that are so effective against low-level challenges can fail us with larger doses or more virulent organisms. Exposure to aerosols generated by expiration, sneezing, and coughing of other infected individuals can increase local concentrations of pathogens, especially in crowded conditions. Classic studies of tuberculosis provide dramatic evidence for aerosol transmission of a virulent pathogen, showing infection of guinea pigs by exposure to air from the rooms of patients with active disease (especially remarkable for calculations indicating infection after inhaling only one mycobacterium) (see Chapter 9) .5",

This reflects in part the devilish complexity of particle chemistry and health effects. Air levels of particles are typically measured in micrograms per cubic meter (/..lg/m3), but it is not yet clear whether particle number, total mass, surface area, chemical composition, metal content, or (most likely) some combination of these determine pathogenicity.8-12 The same liter of typical urban air may be described as containing merely hundreds of large \"fine\" size particles (respirable, 2.5/..lm diameter) or milliqns of very small \"ultrafine\" size particles. Hence, this field still relies on the /..lg/m3 standard used for epidemiologic studies.

A second view of this innate airway defense system emphasizes a role for a \"chemical shield\" in the airway lining fluid in protecting the lung against inhaled bacteria. 21 This hypothesis emphasizes two other important functions for epithelia: the secretion of salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides (defensins, see below), and the production of a lowsalt \u00ab50mmol NaCI) milieu on airway surfaces that allows the defensins to be active against bacteria.

Human defensins are relatively small, 3-to 5-kDa peptides with a characteristic six-cysteine/three-disulfide structure, and are members of a large family of microbicidal peptides. 25 Although genomic data indicate that the family includes more than 20 members, only a few human defensins have been characterized, and divided into ex and ~ subgroups based on structure. The human neutrophil peptides (HNP)-l, -2, and -3, are closely related and found in the dense azurophil granules of neutrophils, and a fourth, HNP-4, is found in the same location but is much less abundant. Two other human defensins, HD-5 and -6, are located in the lysozyme-rich secretory granules of intestinal Paneth cells. Three recently characterized defensins, HBD-1, -2, -3, differ slightly structurally but are noteworthy since their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are expressed in epithelia, including respiratory tract expression. As with the bovine tracheal antimicrobial peptide, a prototypic airway defensin, the synthesis and secretion of HBD-2 (and presumably HBD-3) are regulated by both responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial stimuli and by cytokines. This conclusion is based on both in vitro data and on patient studies, showing that the concentration of antimicrobial peptides such as ~-defensins is increased in various body fluids during inflammatory or infectious diseases, such as pneumonia or cystic fibrosis. Cathelicidins are a more heterogeneous collection of antimicrobial peptides found in many animals, but the sole member found in humans is designated LL-37. 26 Recent studies provide proof of the host defense function of antimicrobial pep tides in living organisms. 27 For example, mice deficient in the antimicrobial peptide mBD-l show delayed clearance of Haemophilus infiuenzae from the lung. 28 Overexpression of LL-37 by viral gene transfer resulted in augmentation of innate host defense in a bronchial xenograft model of cystic fibrosis 29 and in murine animal models of pneumonia and septic shock. 27 In vitro, defensins are potent microbicidal agents at micromolar concentrations against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast and fungi, and certain enveloped viruses. However, this activity requires lowsalt conditions, and increasing salt concentrations rapidly inhibit defensin activity. This requirement prompts the hypothesis that one function of airway epithelia is to maintain an optimally low-salt milieu within the airway lining fluid that facilitates mucociliary clearance. 21 Defensins damage microbes by permeabilizing microbial membranes rich in anionic phospholipids, with relative sparing of host membranes that are rich in cholesterol-and neutral phospholipid.",

In addition to facilitating pathogen uptake and killing by immune cells, SP-A and SP-D are directly antimicrobial, that is, they show direct bactericidal activity in the absence of effector cells. 31 In vivo evidence is also available and indicates a prominent host defense function. Mice genetically deficient in SP-A and SP-D show increased susceptibility to lung infections by bacteria 32 ,33 and viruses. 34 ,35 Importantly, the decreased microbial clearance can be reversed by addition of exogenous SP-A.

Experimental complement depletion studies show decreased lung clearance of certain pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) but not others (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). 38 Mice with genetic deletion of complement components or receptors also show increased susceptibility to lung infections. 39 .40 However, in experimental analysis of bacterial clearance it is difficult (perhaps impossible) to separate the effect of lining fluid immunoglobulins and complement from the same mediators delivered from plasma after the inevitable increase in vascular permeability caused by introduction ofthe organisms. Vaccination against pneumococci generates protective antibody that reduces systemic disease and mortality, but does not apparently change the rate of local lung infection (pneumonia).41 Similarly, for the special case of mucosal IgA, we learn from patients with selective IgA deficiency that most are asymptomatic, but a small minority do experience increased sinopulmonary infections,42 supporting a perhaps modest, but definite, function for lining fluid IgA.

Increases in macrophage number in response to injury derive primarily from influx and differentiation of blood monocytes. Estimates for the life span of AMs in normal individuals range from one to several months. 56 . 57 The evidence for this includes the compelling observation that bone marrow transplant recipients of one gender eventually show repopulation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) AMs by cells showing sex chromosomes of the other gender. 57 The main function of the AM is phagocytosis and clearance of inhaled material, a task it does remarkably well-with some important exceptions. The classic work of Green and Kass 58 established that AMs ingest and kill inhaled bacteria in vivo. Subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed that AMs are avidly phagocytic and readily destroy ingested bacteria such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. injluenzae, as well as other pathogens and particles. 59 Depletion of AMs using clodronate-liposomes has allowed further experimental demonstration of the importance of AMs in early responses to bacteria, since marked decreases in bacterial clearance follow. 60 . 61 This same approach also reveals interesting complexities, including a beneficial effect of AM depletion in experimental tuberculosis (presumably by eliminating the intracytoplasmic \"safe harbor\" AMs provide )62 and species differences, since diametrically opposite effects were seen in one study of AMs and clearance of Cryptococcus by rats and mice. 63 The former illustrates the principle that AMs can ingest, but fail to kill, certain microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium spp., Nocardia spp., and Legionella spp., which are then capable of replicating intracellularly.

The AMs possess a broad array of membrane receptors that mediate binding of organisms and particles. Phagocytosis is initiated by these specific receptors that either recognize serum components (opsonins) or directly recognize molecular determinants on the target. These two mechanisms of particle recognition categorize the phagocytic process as either opsonin-dependent or opsonin-independent. The Fcg and CR3 are the best-characterized opsonin-dependent phagocytosis receptors. Fcg binds to IgG whereas CR3 binds the inactivated complement 3b (iC3b) fragment of complement. Recently other receptors such as collectin receptor, Clq, which binds the mannan binding protein (MBP), has been shown to mediate opsonin-dependent phagocytosis. IgG, iC3b, and MBP are opsonins that directly bind microorganisms and thus mark them for opsonin-dependent phagocytosis. For innate, initial recognition of inhaled foreign material the AM also uses several pathogen-associated pattern receptors, which enable opsonin-independent phagocytosis. 64 \u2022 65 The scavenger receptors constitute one important example. Scavenger receptors (SRs) represent a large family of cell surface glycoproteins that were identified during studies of the mechanisms for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) accumulation in atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. Subsequently, many other SRs on a variety of cells have been identified. The defining feature of the SRs is that they interact with a broad spectrum of ligands. Although the latter are mostly polyanionic molecules, there are a few exceptions to this rule, leading to the summation that they bind \"most, but not all, polyanions\" and to their designation as \"molecular ftypaper.,,66 The SRs are divided into six subgroups, class A to F, based on their proposed tertiary structure. One example relevant to AM host defense function is the class A member MARCO, which can mediate AM uptake of unopsonized pneumococci and environmental particles in vitro and in vivo. The AMs express other SRs but their relative contributions to particle recognition and clearance remain to be defined. 67 Other receptors that mediate opsoninindependent phagocytosis are found on AMs. These include a receptor for B-glucans on fungi, dectin-l,68 the mannose receptor,69 and others. 67 Finally, we must note lung macrophages (and other lung cells) express many of the Toll-like receptors now known to be critical in innate immune responses. The discovery and characterization of this large receptor family is a major recent accomplishmentin immunology and has been extensively reviewed. 70.71 For our purposes, we note that capture of inhaled pathogens by pattern-recognition scavenger receptors facilitates activation of Toll-like receptors by pathogenassociated LPS or lipotechoic acid. The Toll-like receptors in turn trigger an elaborate intracellular signaling cascade that can lead to macrophage activation and release of pro inflammatory mediators. The net effect is to increase the antimicrobial capacity of the macrophage and to recruit additional leukocytes if needed.",

It generates reactive oxygen species (using the respiratory burst) from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase that contribute to pathogen killing. 74 Other oxygen-independent bacterial killing mechanisms include proteases and phagolysosomal enzymes. In addition to reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen intermediates can contribute to pathogen killing.75,76 Human AMs can be shown immunohistochemically to contain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms 2 and 3.77.7 8 The high-output, inducible isoform NOS-2 appears to contribute to antimycobacterial defense,19 but the role of reactive nitrogen intermediates in other antimicrobial responses of human macrophages remains controversial. 8o , 81 After ingestion of particles, the AM functions ultimately to remove the offending material from the lung.

The ciliated epithelial cells of the airways are an integral part of the mucociliary clearance system already discussed. Epithelial cells produce important components of the lining fluid in airway and alveolus, including mucus, surfactant proteins A and D, antimicrobial defensins, complement, and lysozyme. There is also evidence that they have some direct antibacterial function. For example, respiratory epithelial cells function in early clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via interactions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with the bacterium, which promotes epithelial internalization and clearance. 84 Finally, the participation of epithelial cells in mediator networks that initiate and control lung inflammatory responses has been increasingly recognized. Airway epithelial cells secrete a large array of cytokines and other molecules (e.g., IL-l, -5, -6, and -8, and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM_CSF]).27,85 By secreting these mediators, the airway epithelium is able to chemoattract and activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, which in turn immobilize and kill microorganisms. We must note, however, that the specific contribution of epithelial cells has not been fully tested since their selective ablation has not been feasible, in contrast to macrophages and PMNs, for example. Newer epithelial-specific gene targeting strategies may overcome this obstacle in future studies. 8 6--88 Polymorphonuclear N eutrophils After resident AMs, PMNs are the major second cellular defense against invading microorganisms in the lung. Under normal conditions, they are found primarily in the circulation, although a small number is present in lavage samples \u00ab2 %), possibly reflecting a low level of elicitation by ambient environmental exposures. Conveniently, at any given time, up to 40% of blood PMNs are marginated or in transit through the lung, facilitating recruitment when needed. The rapid and large movement of PMNs into the alveoli is achieved by the influence of several chemotactic factors released by AMs and other lung cells (e.g., IL-8, leukotrienes, complement fragments). These cause a rapid diapedesis, which is dominated by transit at the capillary level, in contrast to postvenular sites in other organs.",

The PMNs achieve killing of ingested microorganisms by generation of NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (e.g., superoxide and, after dismutation, hydrogen peroxide) and by phagolysosomal fusion. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase is composed of a heterodimeric membrane-bound complex embedded in the walls of secondary granules (gp91phox and p22phox, forming cytochrome b558) and four cytosolic proteins (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac). During phagocytosis, the secondary granule fuses with the developing phagosome, depositing cytochrome b558 in the membrane. The cytosolic components associate with each other and then with the cytochrome to form the final NADPH oxidase. This complex transfers an electron from NADPH (thus oxidizing it) to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide. Superoxide dismutase converts the highly reactive superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. Fusion of azurophil granules with the phagolysosome permits entry of myeloperoxidase, which catalyzes hydrogen peroxide and chloride to form the oxidant HOCI. HOCI reacts with primary amines to generate highly toxic chloramines, which are powerful antimicrobial compounds active against most species of microorganisms. These metabolites of superoxide are potent microbicidal agents in vitro and are considered critical mediators of bacterial killing in vitro. An alternative hypothesis postulates that superoxide functions by creating electrochemical gradients that serve in turn to activate the primary granule proteins neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G inside the phagocytic vacuole. 89 Other microbicidal factors within the azurophil granules include defensins, bacterial permeability-increasing protein, lysozyme, and other proteases.",

In addition, mast cells also produce a wide range of cytokines and chemokines, and release important lipid mediators, such as LTC4 and LTB4, in response to bacteria. 92 The profile of mast cell mediators produced is tightly regulated with respect to the type and amount, as well as temporal sequence.

In both a model of cecal ligation and puncture and a model of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced peritonitis, mice with normal numbers of mast cells survived bacterial challenge, whereas mast cell-deficient mice succumbed to infection. The ability to overcome infection was restored when mast cells were selectively reconstituted in the peritoneal cavity. The function of mast cells was closely linked to the ability to rapidly recruit neutrophils to the site of infection, supporting the view that mast cells serve to mobilize innate immune responses through early mediator production. The importance of TNF in this process was confirmed by studies in which mice were treated with anti-TNF antibodies. In some responses, the mast cell may be the major source of early TNF release, which is in keeping with observations of neutrophil recruitment after IgE-mediated mast cell activation. 93 Natural Killer Cells Natural killer (NK) cells are important in initial defenses against viral infection of the lungs. They arise from the same hematopoietic lineage as T cells, but differ in that they do not have to mature in the thymus and do not express rearranged antigen receptors. Instead, NK cells display families of cellular receptors that recognize virusinfected (and neoplastic) cells because of their altered expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I tissue antigens. The NK responses are mediated by inhibitory and activating receptors of two structural classes: killer Ig-like and lectin-like receptors. 94 When NK cell receptors fail to detect normal HLA class I, they initiate a program of activation that leads to lysis of the infected cell. The NK cells also release interferon-y (IFN-y), which in turn leads to recruitment of other immune cells. In experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, for example, there is a rapid antiviral NK cell IFN-y response that precedes and leads to recruitment of virusspecific, cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Local release of IL-12 and IL-15 by dendritic cells and macrophages contributes to stimulation of NK cells for rapid antiviral responses in the lung. 94 . 95 Dendritic Cells Dendritic cells (DCs), named for their characteristic long, branched processes, are specialized mononuclear phagocytes with important functions in antigen-presentation and initiation of adaptive immune responses. They are ubiquitous in the body, found in airways, alveolar parenchyma, and thoracic lymph nodes. Acting as sentinels in airways, they sample incoming pathogens and antigens through phagocytosis. When this is accompanied by a second, danger signal (e.g., pathogen patterns recognized by Toll-like receptors) they undergo a phenotypic and functional change from their basal immature state. This maturation promotes the processing of antigen and its presentation on the cell surface, and the migration of the dendritic cell to T-cell-rich areas of nearby lymph nodes. Here they can initiate or amplify adaptive immune responses by triggering proliferation and activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. This cursory summary does not do justice to the rich and detailed analysis of DCs and their role in this process, reviewed elsewhere for the interested reader. 96 ,97 For our purposes, we recognize this resident cell as an important transition between the innate response to inhaled antigenic material and the adaptive immune response that follows.",

The adaptive immune response to pulmonary pathogens includes both humoral and cellular components. The benefit of humoral responses is well illustrated in the classic natural history of untreated pneumococcal pneumonia. Resolution of pneumonia begins with (and survival depends on) the appearance of IgG anti pneumococcal antibodies produced by humoral immune response at about 1 to 2 weeks after the start of the infection. 98 Similarly, the natural history of viral lung infections illustrates the importance of cellular immune responses. Respiratory virus infections elicit CD4+, CD8+, and y8 T-cell responses, although the relative contributions of these subsets to viral clearance can be variable. From studies of influenza and parainfluenza virus infections in mice, we learn that CD8+ cytotoxic T cells playa key role in viral clearance. Neutralizing antibody is also generated late in the primary response, but does function to clear primary infection unless the viral load is high. Typically, effector CD8+ T cells are first detectable in the lung on day 7 postinfection, and the number of CD8+ T cells peaks around day 10; optimal expansion of the CD8+ subset appears to depend on CD4+ T cells. The accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lung results in clearance of the virus by day 10 postinfection and depends on either perforin or Fas mechanisms. 99 It must be noted that cell-mediated immunity plays a role in recovery from influenza infection and may also prevent influenza-associated complications, but it does not seem to contribute significantly in preventing initial infection. lOo The humoral immune system produces antibodies against different influenza antigens, of which the hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody is the most important for neutralization of the virus and thus prevention of illness. The neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibodies are less effective in preventing infection, but they lessen the release of virus from infected cells.",

Hence, one generalization is that humoral (antibody) immunity is most important for successful defense against bacteria, especially encapsulated agents. 102 An important distinction is that most patients with defects involving predominantly humoral immunity generally recover from viral infections because of their normal cellular (T-cell) immune responses. Conversely, people with inadequate cellular immunity are highly susceptible to opportunistic infections with viruses, often presenting as progressive pneumonia caused by parainfluenza 3 virus, RSY, cytomegalovirus, varicella, or other opportunistic organisms, for example, Pneumocystis jiroveci.

As in primary T-cell deficiencies, these individuals experience suppression of lymphocyte-dependent immunity and increased incidence of viral and opportunistic pathogens. Similarly, the modern tragedy of AIDS, which primarily targets T-cell immunity, features enhanced susceptibility to opportunistic infection, in particular lifethreatening infections of the lung. 104 Finally, we can consider evidence from vaccination efforts, which also illustrate the power (and limitations) of adaptive immunity for lung defense. Vaccines are available to prevent two of the most common and most deadly causes of lower respiratory tract infections: influenza and pneumococcal disease. Influenza vaccines prevent influenza as well as several complications of influenza, via antibodies highly specific for the strain used for immunization (requiring new immunization programs for ever-changing influenza strains I05 ). Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine prevents pneumococcal sepsis and systemic disease, but appears ineffective in reducing the incidence of local lung infection (pneumonia 41 ), indicating that not all systemic antibody responses translate into a functional barrier against initiation of infection in the lungs.",

It describes a distinct form of chronic inflammation, dominated by mononuclear phagocytes that take the form of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells. lo6 Typically these cells congregate and form well-demarcated focal lesions called granulomas, although a looser, more diffuse arrangement may be found. In addition, there is usually an admixture of other cells, especially lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. Understanding granuloma development and its role in lung defense is pertinent to a broad cross section of pulmonary pathology. Since it is most relevant to lung host defense, we will focus on granulomatous responses to mycobacterial infection. There are detailed reviews of the shared and unique features of pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and other lung granulomatous disorders available for the interested reader. [107] [108] [109] Fortunately for our review, the sequence of cellular events in granuloma formation is indeed best defined in responses to tuberculosis, the prototypical granulomatous disease (see Chapter 9) . The process begins with activation of CD4+ T cells by antigen-presenting cells that have 59 ingested and processed antigenic mycobacterial components. This leads to proliferation and differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells to T-helper-l (Thl) cells, which release characteristic cytokines, especially IFN-y. These mediators, in turn, activate macrophages for improved killing of intracellular bacteria and also account for the classic change of macrophage appearance to an enlarged cell with epithelioid morphology. The process also activates a number of cell surface molecules (e.g., macrophage fusion receptor, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein [DC-STAMP], CD47, CD44) thought to mediate cell-cell fusion and the formation of giant cells.IID-113",

Based on animal models, a hierarchy exists: CD4+ T cells are most important, followed by CD8+ T cells, with precise roles of yo T cells and CDl restricted T cells less well understood. There is also a temporal sequence to the involvement of different T-cell subtypes in the phases of granuloma formation.

Mice genetically deficient in CD4+ T cells form aberrant lesions that are unable to control bacterial numbers or prevent dissemination, establishing that CD4+T cells are important for initiation and construction of granulomas. 116 In humans, the requirement for CD4+ T cells is demonstrated by the disseminated mycobacterial infections seen in patients during the late stages of AIDS when CD4+ T-cell counts drop.117",

After cross-talk between T cells and macrophages via various cytokines, notably IFN-y, TNFex, and leukotriene A (LTA), macrophages are activated and have increased ability to kill the intracellular pathogens.llS.119The importance of IFN-yin human tuberculosis is clearly indicated by reports of severe and even fatal infections with mycobacteria in patients with defects in the IFN-y receptor. 120 Specific changes in activated macrophages include increased phagocytic and microbicidal ability (through increased production of reactive oxygen species [ROS] and reactive nitrogen intermediates [RNI)) and increased release of cytokines, which promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. The established view has been that necrosis ensues upon vigorous activation of the macrophages by the adaptive immune response (T cells). This view is based in part on the first appearance of necrotic centers at 2 to 3 weeks after infection in a rabbit model, a time frame consistent with generation of an adaptive response. However, this view has been challenged by findings in mycobacteria-infected guinea pigs where the development of the necrotic core was an early event and almost certainly preceded the emergence of the acquired immune response. 121 Granuloma formation typically ends in fibrosis. Fibrosis serves to wall off the granuloma contents and limit spread of infection and organ damage. It was shown in early studies that healed primary lesions are usually sterile within 5 years. 122 Mediators implicated in the fibrosis process in granulomatous inflammation are numerous. Examples include TNF 123 and transforming growth factor-(TGF_~),124 among many others. 125 The Th2 cytokine IL-13 may also mediate fibrosis associated with granulomatous responses. Blockade of IL-13 in schistosomeinfected mice reduces fibrosis without altering the Th2 cytokine profile. 126 It is worth noting that there is disagreement as to the relative primacy of macrophagederived vs. T cell derived factors. 11S ,125",

The AMs possess a broad array of membrane receptors that mediate binding of organisms and particles. Phagocytosis is initiated by these specific receptors that either recognize serum components (opsonins) or directly recognize molecular determinants on the target. These two mechanisms of particle recognition categorize the phagocytic process as either opsonin-dependent or opsonin-independent. The Fcg and CR3 are the best-characterized opsonin-dependent phagocytosis receptors. Fcg binds to IgG whereas CR3 binds the inactivated complement 3b (iC3b) fragment of complement. Recently other receptors such as collectin receptor, Clq, which binds the mannan binding protein (MBP), has been shown to mediate opsonin-dependent phagocytosis. IgG, iC3b, and MBP are opsonins that directly bind microorganisms and thus mark them for opsonin-dependent phagocytosis. For innate, initial recognition of inhaled foreign material the AM also uses several pathogen-associated pattern",
