            "text": "Most success to-date in the treatment of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has been achieved with inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. The use of azidothymidine (AZT) has provided clinical benefits to patients with advanced disease and some clinical efficacy has been observed for a second nucleoside analogue, dideoxycytidine. Both drugs can induce serious side-effects with potential for long-term use being restricted, but other nucleoside derivatives are being investigated. Alternative targets for the chemotherapy of HIV infections are under consideration such as protease activity involved in the processing of viral proteins, anti-sense oligodeoxynudeotides to complement essential viral genes and post-translational events such as myristylation or glycosylation (subjects to be reviewed in the Journal's supplement on AIDS and related infections; Bint & Oxford, 1988) . In relation to the latter target, the antiviral properties of a series of polyhydroxyalkaloids against the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro have recently been described (Gruters et al., 1987; Tyms et al., 1987; Walker et at., 1987; A. Karpas, unpublished data) . These natural substances, which accumulate in plants and microorganisms but can also be synthesised, bear a structural resemblance to monosaccharides. Three different structural types are active, namely polyhydroxy derivatives of octahydroindolizine (castanospermine; CAST), piperidine (deoxynorimycin; DNJ) and pyrrolidine (dihydroxymethyldihydroxypyrrolidine; DMDP) (reviewed by Fellows, 1986) . These compounds are characterised by their ability to inhibit glucosidase activities involved in the trimming of the oligosaccharide side-chains of glycoproteins. The first step in the synthesis of iV-linked sugars in mammalian cells involves transfer of the glycan component of a lipidglycan intermediate to asparagjne residues on the nascent polypeptide chain. The initial structure of the branched glycan of TV-linked glycoproteins is .Af-acetylglucosamine 2 mannose 7-9 glucose 3. Subsequent modification involves the removal of the outermost glucose residue by glucosidase 1 (a 1,2 linkage) and the two remaining glucose residues by glucosidase 11 (<xl,3 linkages). This is a prerequisite of any further modification of the glycan moiety in the Golgi region by mannosidases, other glycosidases and transferases leading to hybrid and complex-type oligosaccharides (Fuhnnann, Bause & Pleogh, 1985; Martinez & Barsignian, 1987) . CAST and DMDP both inhibit glucosidase 1 (Elbein et at., 1984; Fellows, 1986) and DNJ inhibits glucosidase 1 and 11 (Saunier et al., 1982; Fuhrmann, Bause & Pleogh, 1985) .",

            "text": "The external glycoprotein of HIV (gpl20) is the major surface component by which the virion attaches to CD4(T4) cellular receptors on helper T-cells (Dalgleish et at., 1984) . The envelope gene of HIV 1 encodes a precursor glycoprotein gpl6O which is cleaved to produce gpl20 and gp41, a transmembrane glycoprotein (Muesing et al., 1985; Ratner et at., 1985; Robey et al., 1985; Veronese et at., 1985) . The gpl20 is heavily glycosylated with up to 24 A'-linked glycosylation sites (Muesing et al., 1985; Ratner et al., 1985) . The expression of this glycoprotein on the surface of the host-cell after infection is responsible for cell fusion and syncytium formation (Lifson et al., 1986) and this may contribute to the loss of CD4+ cells in AIDS (Barnes, 1986; Lifson et al., 1986) . Treatment of HIV-infected T-cells in vitro with CAST, DNJ or DMDP at concentrations of 1 mM or more had a profound effect on the production of syncytia and virus growth (Gruters et al., 1987; Tyms et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1987) . The specificity of this effect was shown by using CD4+ cells constitutively expressing the HIV tat gene and transfected with a plasmid containing the art and env genes of HIV 1 (Sodroski et al., 1986) . The spontaneous production of large syncytia in these cells displayed a dose-dependent inhibition when exposed to CAST (Walker et al., 1987) . In contrast, deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) (Gruters et al., 1987) which blocks the cleavage of a 1,2 mannose residues by inhibiting mannosidase 1 or swainsonine (Montefiori, Robinson & Mitchel, 1987) , which prevents the removal of a 1,3-and o 1,6linked mannose residues by a-mannosidase 11, were both ineffective against HIV. As indicated by lectin binding studies (Lifson et al., 1986) , these results support the notion that oligosaccharides of the high mannose-type present on gpl20 are critical for correct interaction with the host-cell. Extracellular levels of HIV from CAST-treated cells were similar to untreated controls, when measured by reverse transcriptase or p24 antigen assays but infectivity was reduced (Walker et al., 1987) . It appeared, therefore, that the retention of glucose residues on the surface glycans of HIV (Gruters et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1987) interferred with the infectivity. However, incorrect trimming of glucose residues is also known to affect the cleavage of precursors and intracellular transport of glycoproteins and this can alter their surface expression.",

The injection of young rats with CAST (up to 2000 mg/kg/ip) daily for three days induced diarrhoea suggestive of an inhibitory effect against gut glycosidases (Saul et al., 1985) . This was eliminated when animals were fed a simple diet based on glucose rather than complex carbohydrates although the inhibitory activity of 500 ings/kg on a-glucosidascs found in the liver and other organs was not reversed. In another study, the LD J0 for CAST in mice was also greater than 500 mg/kg (Sunkara et al., 1987) . Evidence for the non-toxic nature of polyhydroxyalkaloids in man was provided when derivatives of DNJ were used to control Type II diabetes (up to 200 mg/day orally for three days). The medication was well tolerated with no apparent side effects (Joubert, Bam & Manyane, 1986; Schnack et al., 1986) . Further information on toxicity and antiviral activity of glucosidase inhibitors in vivo should come from the study of retroviral infections in animal models. Treatment with either CAST or DNJ was recently shown to inhibit the growth in vitro of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoLV). In agreement with studies on HIV, neither of the mannosidase inhibitors, DMJ or swainsonine, showed antiviral activity against MoLV (Sunkara et al., 1987) .",
