            "text": "Studies of infectious diseases have been limited by the lack of models that recapitulate normal cellular physiology and pathology. Developments in organotypic models have paved the road towards further studies of viral infections and host-virus interactions. For example, human intestinal organoids were efficiently used to study many viruses, such as rotavirus, norovirus, enterovirus 71, and human adenovirus. 1 Mammalian airway organoids are complex three-dimensional structures characterised by different cellular composition and designed to mimic lung structures. Early research attempted to develop these organoids from different progenitor cells, including basal cells, secretory cells, and alveolar epithelial cells. 2 In the past 5 years, scientists were able to generate mature lung organoids that contain basal, ciliated, and club cells. These organoids were used to study diseases such as cystic fibrosis and lung tumours, and infections. 3 One study 4 used airway organoids to look at viral replication, tissue tropism, and immune response to many human influenza A and avian viruses.",

This isolation was enhanced after SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and propagated in TMPRSS2expressing VeroE6 cells, indicating the vital role of TMPRSS2 serine protease in virus infectivity. 5 Thus, in-vitro models are effective in the study of virus propagation, but they poorly recapitulate respiratory tract histology and function.",

Airway organoids can be generated using healthy lung tissue derived from patients undergoing surgical resection, and SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from clinical specimens from patients who have tested positive. After the airway organoid is infected with SARS-CoV-2, immunofluorescence and electron scanning microscopes could be used to study the cytopathic effects of viral particles on different cell types. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR could determine viral replication kinetics and genetic alterations, and transcriptomic profiling could reveal the differential expression of genes related to viral infection. Additionally, flow cytometry enables the detection and quantification of different cell types before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
