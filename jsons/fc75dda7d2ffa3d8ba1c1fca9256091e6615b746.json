Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19. However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection per se or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndromeinduced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Based on the current evidence from case reports and case series, this",

The world and China map showing the geographical distribution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is shown in Figure 1 ; the cut-off date for this data extraction was March 5, 2020. 4 Surprisingly, in addition to the acute respiratory symptoms, patients with COVID-19 also have varying degrees of liver damage/dysfunction. For example, Chen et al. 5 showed that more than a third of COVID-19 patients have some liver function test abnormalities. Most of these infected patients had mild-to-moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels; one patient had severely elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L, AST of 1445 U/L). 5 Since COVID-19related liver dysfunction is now attracting widespread attention, this review discusses the epidemiological characteristics, the potential mechanisms, and the treatment options for liver dysfunction induced by COVID-19.",

Specifically, in these four studies, the proportion of infected patients with increased serum AST levels ranged from 24.1% to 36.6% (Fig. 2) . 5, 13, 17, 18 In a survey from Zhejiang Province, China, the proportion of patients with increased serum AST levels was only 16.1%, whereas the proportion of those with increased serum ALT levels was not specified. 12 It seems likely that the proportion of infected patients with increased serum AST levels in Wuhan (i.e. the area in which the epidemic of COVID-19 started) is much greater than cases reported outside Wuhan.

However, previous studies have found that bile duct epithelial cells may also express ACE2 receptor at a concentration 20 times higher than in hepatocytes and these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might also cause bile duct epithelial cell damage. 21, 22 However, significant increases in circulating levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or gamma-glutamyltransferase (that may reflect bile duct injury) have been rarely reported in COVID-19 patients. 9 Liver histopathologic features from COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant damage in hepatocytes or bile duct cells. 23 For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is more likely due to secondary liver damage than the use of hepatotoxic therapies or the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, or multiple organ dysfunction.

Most experts believe that the occurrence of multiple organ failure is mainly related to the sudden initiation of an inflammatory \"storm\" in the critically ill COVID-19 patients. 26 The so-called inflammatory \"storm\", or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is strongly related to activation of both natural and cellular immunity that is triggered by COVID-19 infection. 27 In fact, the virus is able to directly induce multiple proinflammatory signals via toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of killer T lymphocytes. 28 The activated T lymphocytes then attack the infected body cells, leading to their apoptosis and necrosis, until T lymphocytes are depleted. Damage-related pattern molecules released by dead infected cells can further amplify some inflammatory signals, such as TLRs. At the same time, T-lymphocyte depletion cannot control viral and bacterial infections, thereby activating multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, which lead to macrophage activation and secondary inflammatory reactions. Subsequently, when more inflammatory cytokines are released, more cell damage and necrosis are observed (Fig. 3) . Such a vicious cycle is capable of causing multiple injuries, not only to the lungs but also to the liver, heart, and kidneys.",

The subsequent marked increase in reactive oxygen species and their peroxidation products can act as a second messenger, activating redoxsensitive transcription factors, and further amplifying the release of multiple proinflammatory factors, causing liver damage. 30 All the aforementioned findings suggest that pneumonia-associated hypoxia is one of the most important factors causing secondary liver injury in COVID-19 patients.",

The ACE2 cellular receptor is highly expressed in human lung tissues, gastrointestinal tract, liver, vascular endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells. 33 In addition, skin, nasal cavity, and oral mucosa basal cells also express the ACE2 receptor. 27 All organs with high expression of the ACE2 receptor may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection. 34 Activation of the ACE2/Ang After the SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenic T cells are rapidly activated, producing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. GM-CSF will further activate CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocytes, producing a larger amount of IL-6 and other proinflammatory factors, and thereby inducing an inflammatory \"storm\" that leads to immune damage to other organs, such as the lungs and the liver. Both IL-6 and GM-CSF are two key proinflammatory factors that trigger the inflammatory \"storm\" in patients with COVID-19. (1-7)/Mas signaling pathway or inhibition of the ACE/Ang II/ AT1R pathway could be potential pathways for the treatment of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, both ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists might be used not only for treating high blood pressure but also for reducing systemic inflammatory response and improving patient mortality. 35 Recently, Chen et al. 36 reported that glycyrrhizic acid derivatives might also have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the first-line drugs for anti-inflammatory protection in liver disease, and it has been used in clinical practice for many years. 37 In particular, glycyrrhizic acid is a triterpene glycoside isolated from the root of the licorice plant. ACE2 is a cellular type I membrane protein that is mostly expressed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestine. Full-length ACE2 consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single trans-membrane helix and a ;40-residue intracellular segment. 38 Glycyrrhizin has the potential to bind to ACE2 receptor with an estimated DG (kcal/mol) of -9, with the binding sites of ARG-559, GLN-388, ARG-393, and ASP-30. 36",

(2) The proportion of infected patients with elevated serum transaminase levels is higher in adults than in children and in men than in women, respectively. However, we suggest that further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations. In the meantime, we believe that the front-line medical staff should pay attention to liver function tests in patients infected with COVID-19. For those patients with a pre-existing history of liver diseases (especially older patients), special attention should be paid to monitoring hepatic changes caused by COVID-19, whilst carefully identifying the cause of the liver dysfunction. 39 We also recommend that front-line medical staff should assess the use of appropriate hepatoprotective therapies, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease, in order to attenuate the potentially deleterious impact of COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction.
