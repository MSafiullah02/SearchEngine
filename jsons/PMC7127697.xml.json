Influenza epidemics and pandemics are responsible for 250 000\u2013500 000 deaths each year (www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/) and >50 million fatalities worldwide in the past century (www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/basics/past-pandemics.html), respectively. The next influenza pandemic is estimated to cause \u223c60 million deaths [1]. Ideally, vaccination within 2 months of the outbreak can provide effective protection [2]. However, because several months are necessary for vaccine development and administration, the infection risk is heightened during the non-vaccine period. This is further supported by the outcomes of 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that originated in China, in which the disease was transmitted globally within few weeks, but the first vaccine Phase I clinical study began a year after the outbreak [3]. Logistically, an effective pandemic preparedness plan should include both vaccination and alternative mitigation methods (pharmaceutical \u2013 antiviral; non-pharmaceutical \u2013 isolation, administrative control, personal protective measures). Therefore, respiratory protection devices are a key non-pharmaceutical intervention that is essential to the global strategy for pandemic readiness.",

Once a subject is infected, nanometer-to-millimeter-sized pathogenic particles can be released while breathing, speaking, sneezing, or coughing, and infect a host respiratory tract via different mechanisms that depend on the aerodynamic size of the particles (da <5 \u03bcm, lower respiratory tract; 5 < da < 100 \u03bcm, upper respiratory tract). Similarly to infection, current respiratory protection devices filter infectious particles in a size-dependent manner. Filtration efficiency, comfort (e.g., breathability), and fit at the face\u2013mask interface govern technical performance. While effective management and availability of control measures are crucial to an outbreak response, the pathogens (virus/bacteria/fungi) captured on filters are an intrinsic concern because of fear of cross-infection, new aerosol release, and contaminated waste.",

Another crucial issue is cross-infection/transmission. Because viruses and microorganisms can survive for at least a few hours to several days [4], masks and respirators become a source of infection for the wearer and others, thus limiting them to single use. Infectious aerosols on filters can also be re-released into the environment (i.e., re-aerosolization), for example through accidents. With a particle diameter of 1.15 \u03bcm, re-aerosolization from N95 respirators as a result of a fall (drop height, 0.76 m) was between 0.002% and 0.012% [5].",

As an example, decontamination of N95 respirators by autoclave, 160 \u00b0C dry heat, 70% isopropanol, and soap and water lowered the filtration efficiency [6]. Ethylene oxide treatment of respirators caused deposition of hazardous residues of 2-hydroxyethyl acetate on the straps, and bleach, oxidants, or dimethyldioxirane raised issues of sharp odor and incompatibility with staples/nosepiece [7]. Despite the need for further research, with safety as a preponderant concern, mask recyclability would be beneficial because it would reduce the amount of biohazardous waste and derived risks.

Representative examples include fabrication using nanofibers and incorporation of electric charge by plasma treatment and charge-carrying agents. However, major technical challenges remain to be addressed for effective preparedness from the standpoint of contamination and infrastructure. Hence, production of a filter that inactivates the collected pathogens would bring key improvements to current surgical masks and respirators, resulting in increased protection, reduced risk of cross-infection, and recyclability without decontamination (Figure 1).Box 1Performance of Respiratory ProtectionThe key technical components of the performance of current respiratory protection devices are filtration efficiency, fit, and comfort. Each has a significant role in protective efficacy, and specific parameters can be tuned to improve them.\nFit: non-filtered air entering through a poor seal between mask and face is a prominent concern. Efforts towards reducing faceleaks can be grouped as follows.(i) Material selection that allows customizable mask shape/tightness.(ii) Investigation of wearers\u2019 facial features, and simulation of the spatial distribution of leaks to guide mask design.(iii) Fit testing/training optimization to increase efficacy/compliance.\nFiltration efficiency: whereas N95 respirators have a certified filtration efficiency of 95%, surgical masks have low performance. Several major parameters can be controlled to decrease particle penetration,(i) Decreasing the diameter of fibers.(ii) Decreasing the size of filter pores,(iii) Controlling fiber electrical charge through manufacturing process/material selection.(iv) Increasing the thickness of the filters.\nUser comfort: the wearer\u2019s perception of comfort is crucial to correct practices and effective protection. Tolerability during mask use is often limited by the following factors.(i) Reduced breathability caused by pressure drop across the mask.(ii) Heat build-up inside the mask because of reduced air exchange while breathing and lowered heat convection from the face.(iii) Carbon dioxide rebreathing.(iv) Discomfort from prolonged contact between skin and rough materials.(iv) Difficulty in communicating.",

Chlorine compounds such as N-halamines and iodine-treated filters have been assessed against bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli) [9]. In addition, surgical masks functionalized with silver nitrate nanoparticles or quaternary ammonium inactivated bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively) by interaction with thiol groups (100% reduction in \u223c48 h) and membrane permeability damage (\u223c92% reduction in 1 h), respectively 10, 11. However, antimicrobial technologies based on silver/copper, reactive oxygen molecules, iodine, and titanium dioxide did not exhibit inactivation properties against MS2 virus [12]. Another approach to inhibit virus transmission involves modification of the filter surface with the antigen-specific antibodies [13]. Despite the merits of each approach, effective protection against virus aerosols is still limited by slow action (rapid inactivation should occur in the order of minutes, not hours) or binding specificity. Recently, salt recrystallization was found to physically destroy viruses on surgical mask filters within few minutes in a strain-independent manner, potentially enabling reuse without separate processing steps [14]. Notably, most studies have focused on the functionalization of the outermost and middle layers of the mask. The final design of the protection device layers should consider the spatial deposition of aerosols within masks and their contact surface.",

First, an inactivation mechanism should act rapidly to avoid cross-infection. Although additional aspects are involved (e.g., fraction of transferred pathogens, surface area), unsafe handling and people\u2019s tendency to touch their face every \u223c4 minutes lead to a risk of contact transmission from a pathogen-laden mask/respirator [15]. Second, pathogens should be neutralized in a strain-nonspecific way. The pathogen/strain responsible for the next pandemic cannot be exactly predicted because of continuous mutation. As such, antibody-functionalized protective devices that target a strain-specific virus would delay the emergency response. Thus, the pathogen-killing mechanism should guarantee broad-spectrum protection. Third, the ideal technology should be device-independent. In the case of a pandemic outbreak, time-consuming production and cost would be major limitations to respirator use. Although a certified respirator is recommended, considering the heavy use of surgical masks and scarcity of respirators, the technology should be easily extendable to masks and other existing infection control measures.

Based on the same mechanisms, with additional electrostatic interactions of charged fibers, masks offer respiratory protection by filtration. The degree of respiratory protection is affected by the technical performance of the mask (filtration efficiency, comfort, faceseal, proper donning/doffing, and pathogen infectivity), as well as the infrastructure (available supplies, policies, and cost). In addition, because virus/bacteria infectivity is maintained on the fibers, the filter becomes a source of cross-infection, re-aerosolization, and environmental contamination.
