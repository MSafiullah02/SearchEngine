In deontological ethics, the patient is at the center (patient-centric) of the decision process, and the clinician has a fiduciary responsibility to his/her patients23. In other words, the physician makes decision that is in the best interest of the patient. In contrast, during times of national crisis, it can be argued that the utilitarian or public-centric approach takes precedence23. Priorities are shifted from doing what is needed to save an individual patient to doing what is needed to achieve the greater public good. The utilitarian approach would require that a certain degree of rationing is needed to preserve the overall well-being of society. For example, suppose there are two patients who will require a truly emergency operation right now!; the first patient is a 30-year old woman who suffered a major liver laceration and will require massive blood transfusion, and a second patient is a 65-year old man who has peritonitis from a perforated diverticulitis. In normal times, the surgeon can fulfill his/her fiduciary responsibilities to both, because the community has sufficient capacity for him/her to do both operations simultaneously. In contrast, in a situation where the surgeon can perform only one surgery and resources such as blood products are scarce, under utilitarian ethics, the surgeon would choose to operate on the 65-year old man with peritonitis, because this would require fewer resources. To do otherwise would deplete the blood products, thus denying life-saving opportunities for more than one patient and preventing society from achieving the end goal of saving the most lives.",

Aside from advance directives of a patients\u2019 wishes to not be kept intubated for a prolonged period of time, taking a ventilator from one patient (without the patient\u2019s consent) to give to another, is against the principles of autonomy (the right of the patient to make informed decisions about his/her medical care), beneficence (actions that serve the best interest of the patient and the family), and non-maleficence (do no harm). In essence, this recommendation, which has been advocated by some bioethicists, is asking health care professionals to, metaphorically speaking, push the fat man over the bridge in order to save the five lives. From a Kantian perspective, removing the breathing tube from one patient and giving it to another in order to maximize the greater good of society violates the moral imperative of never treating other people as means to ends, even if the action leads to a greater good. No matter how laudable the consequences are, the moral imperative should never be violated, \u201ceven if the heavens fall\u201d24.",

Positive duties require us to render assistance, knowing that we cannot provide assistance to all. Therefore, positive duties are selective and circumscribed. Negative duties require that we avoid harming to all others and therefore, our negative duties are owed to all26. When negative and positive duties clash, negative duties take precedence23.",

Even though one may not be able to provide ventilators to everyone who needs them due to a surge of COVID-19 positive patients (positive duty), one should not pull the breathing tube out of one patient to give it to another. By so doing, one is causing harm to that one patient (negative duty). Because the negative duty (do not harm the patient) takes precedence over positive duty (one can only help many but not all), the active act of pulling the breathing tube is therefore, morally inferior to the passive act of supportive care.",

Though he did not use the term \u201cdouble-effect\u201d, Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is credited for this principle in defense of the Just War doctrine, a doctrine to justify waging war27. Aquinas purports that some actions have not just one effect, but rather two (i.e. double effect); a good effect and a bad effect. The double-effect principle allows for bad effects as long as the following conditions are met: (1) the action itself must be morally good or morally neutral, (2) the bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved, (3) the motive must be to achieve only the good effect, and (4) the good effect must be greater than the bad effect. Additionally, the bad effects may be foreseen but never intended. In essence, the double-effect states that one can perform an act that has some bad consequences as long as the act is overall good and if the bad effects are unintended.",

The greater number of lives saved, the motive to achieve the greater good for society (i.e. more lives saved), and death foreseen but unintended fulfilled the criteria. But, the bad effect (death) cannot be considered as morally good or morally neutral; and the patient posed no threat to society and therefore, the act of withdrawing ventilator support was neither morally good nor morally neutral. Furthermore, the death of the patient was used as a means to achieve the greater good for society. One might argue that the patient was not a means and if by chance, the patient somehow survives such an ordeal and that his/her survival did not affect the end goal of having more lives saved, then the double-effect principle has not been violated. Most patients, however, whose tubes are removed while still ventilator-dependent will die. Thus, in the case of reallocating ventilators during a COVID-19 shortage, the death of one patient is exchanged for the life of others; this is a principle that clearly violates the double-effect principle.",

The surgeon is called to care for a young person who was involved in a minor car accident. By all metrics, this young person could provide the necessary organs to the five dying patients. Does the surgeon remove the required organs? The act would fulfill the utilitarian perspective of achieving a more efficient and just allocation of resources, but, the principle of non-maleficence would prohibit such an act, and the Kantian philosophy that an individual should never be treated as a means also invalidates the act as being immoral.",

Prior experiences, such as the unconscionable Tuskegee experiment and the Willowbrook school study, have left vulnerable communities understandably distrustful of the medical system28\n,\n29. Consequently, this distrust may have adverse impacts on how the public interprets any COVID-19 guidelines of ventilator reallocation that prioritizes a group or reallocates resources which have been instituted at hospitals across the country. While most of the guidelines were drawn with best intentions, even the most thoughtfully crafted ones run the risk of suffering from implicit bias. One study noted that \u201crespondents expressed greater resentment, gave lower health care priority scores, and were more reluctant to make a financial contribution to the health care costs of patients presented as black and unemployed than as white and unemployed\u201d30.",

This approach will limit as best as possible any speculation and value-based judgements. Unfortunately, this approach can conflict with the views of the public. Discussing the Influenza pandemic, Biddison et al. described a model for public values regarding how scarce mechanical ventilators should be allocated, one that is strikingly similar to the problem many hospitals are facing today during the COVID-19 pandemic31. The study panel emphasized a dichotomy between the understanding of the lay public and reality of decisions that must be made in the health care setting. Most strikingly, the public expressed a desire to simply create more ventilators, and that emergency allocation of resources by health care teams would simply exacerbate existing inequalities (such as insured versus uninsured). Part of the ethical duty of health care workers is to address and quell these concerns from the public. One approach to do so may be improved communication - public officials can be more responsive in communications surrounding how ventilators and other life-saving equipment is being allocated and in describing the realities of why simply creating more equipment may not be immediately possible. Discussing such information honestly and transparently can also help combat misinformation that has circulated during COVID-19, as it has during the past.",
