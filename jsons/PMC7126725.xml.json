Each plate included a positive control (bacteria without the drug) and negative control (medium only) and serial two-fold dilution of the drug. P. gingivalis suspensions were prepared in \u2018P. gingivalis broth\u2019 whereas other bacterial species were prepared in brain heart infusion broth. Bacterial inoculums were prepared as described previously and 100 \u03bcl of 1 \u00d7 106\n cells/ml bacterial suspensions were added to each well. Subsequently, microtiter plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in an anaerobic chamber. Visual inspection was used to determine the MIC. After MIC determination, 20 \u03bcl of suspension from each well was inoculated in blood agar plates for 48 h for observation. The lowest drug concentration that yielded no growth was documented as minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). For P. gingivalis all the procedures took the slow growth of the organism into account.",

As a TCM, Fructus armeniaca mume (wu mei) is taken internally to relieve cough and used externally for the removal of warts and corns.15 Its antibacterial effect on some bacteria is known, but no research has been carried out on its action against oral bacteria. It has low toxicity compared with inedible oral antiseptic mouth rinses (e.g. chlorhexidine), costs little and is widely available. If it is effective in inhibiting the bacteria commonly found in the oral biofilm, it may be a safe agent for the effective reduction of the oral biofilm and the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.",

This study is a key step in the discovery of new drugs/treatments using TCM. Further research is needed to identify the active components related to the antibacterial action, to determine the range of action, and to investigate the mechanisms involved. The antibacterial actions include the MIC and MBC. It is also necessary to test the antibacterial action on other oral bacteria and fungi. TCM extracts that are less effective against oral bacteria, have potential for further investigation because the active components inside the extracts may only present in very low concentration, so although they may be very effective, the overall antibacterial effect of the extracts is small.",

It contains a number of acids (e.g. citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, picric acid); these might create a low pH environment that may account for its antibacterial effect. Several herbs that have an antibacterial action can be combined. This may allow more effective control of microorganisms, and it may be possible to combat the newly emerging resistant microorganisms. TCM with similar properties to Fructus armeniaca mume should be screened for their antimicrobial actions.
