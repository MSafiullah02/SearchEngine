These interactions comprise strong ties, driven by dyadic relationships, and weak ties, based on node-specific attributes. The interplay between strong and weak ties plays an important role on dynamical processes that could unfold on complex systems. However, seldom do we have access to precise information about the time-varying topology of interaction patterns. A particularly elusive question is to distinguish strong from weak ties, on the basis of the sole node dynamics. Building upon analytical results, we propose a statistically-principled algorithm to reconstruct the backbone of strong ties from data of a spreading process, consisting of the time series of individuals' states. Our method is numerically validated over a range of synthetic datasets, encapsulating salient features of real-world systems. Motivated by compelling evidence, we propose the integration of our algorithm in a targeted immunization strategy that prioritizes influential nodes in the inferred backbone. Through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic networks and a real-world case study, we demonstrate the viability of our approach.",

These interactions can be categorized into two main classes [7] . One class corresponds to interactions that are recurrently formed between node pairs, following dyadic relationships that are called strong ties [8] . Interactions in the workplace or family ties belong to this class, which forms the backbone of the network [9, 10] . The second class encompasses interactions that are based on features of the nodes, which are not attributable to dyadic ties with other nodes. For instance, interactions among people queuing in a line or sitting on a plane belong to this class, whereby interactions * Now at Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Groningen, 9747 AG Groningen, The Netherlands. \u2020 Also at Department of Biomedical Engineering, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn NY, 11201; mpor-firi@nyu.edu \u2021 Also at Office of Innovation, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn NY, 11201; alessandro.rizzo@polito.it are triggered by individual attributes such as extroversion in talking to strangers.

While activities can be estimated following the literature on ADNs [14, 29] , the inference of the backbone of strong ties remains an open challenge. Preliminary efforts in this direction can be found in Ref. [30] . Therein, the authors have proposed a method to reconstruct the backbone of a temporal network from the direct observation of the pattern of interactions over an accessible time-window. Particularly elusive is the problem of distinguishing strong from weak ties from observations of node dynamics, which is typically the only knowledge available in real epidemiological settings [31] .",

We adopt the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate, which offers a less conservative criterion with respect to the standard Bonferroni criterion [59] . This method is implemented as follows. First, we set the level of significance \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. The quantity \u03b1 measures the largest admissible probability that at least one of the null hypotheses is erroneously rejected and it is typically set to a small quantity, to ensure the test significance. Then, the n(n \u2212 1) p values are sorted in ascending order and denoted as \u03c0 (1) < \u03c0 (2) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c0 ((n\u22121)n) . Let L be the largest integer for which it holds \u03c0 (L) < L\u03b1/(n \u2212 1)n. Then, the null hypothesis is rejected for all the pairs of nodes associated with a p value smaller than \u03c0 (L) .

Hence, we set the corresponding element of the estimated backbone adjacency matrix\u011c as\u011c i j =\u011c ji = 1. We note that this is the step that requires the highest computational effort, since the n(n \u2212 1) p values should be computed and sorted in ascending order.

In fact, the key properties of our argument is that the state transitions (from susceptible to infected) are triggered by the interactions and that they occur multiple times, due to the spontaneous recovery process. The former leaves the footprint of strong ties on the nodal dynamics, the latter affords the use of statistical tests to ensure significance to our results.",

Let x 1 , . . . , x n be the state of the system at time t, then the RADN model indicates thatUpon conditioning on X j t = 1, we factor the term associated with j out of the multiplication to obtainFirst, we consider the case in which nodes i and j do not share a strong tie, that is G i j = G ji = 0. In this case, from Eq. (1) we derive P i j = P ji = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 )/(n \u2212 1). We substitute P i j and P ji in Eqs. (A1) and (A2), and we compute the limit for n \u2192 \u221e of their difference asWe note that Eq. (A3) is the generic summand of P j\u2192i in Eq. (3), from which the claim in Eq. (4b) follows. We further observe that each of the summands of P j\u2192i is a nonnegative random variable, which is bounded from above by the estimation in Eq. (A3). Even though these random variables are not independent and not identically distributed (since they depend on the time-series of the nodes' health state that are self-correlated) they are bounded and their correlation tends to 0 in the long-time. Hence, a central limit theorem applies to P j\u2192i , according to Ref. [67] . Such an observation guarantees that P j\u2192i converges to a Gaussian distribution, as supported by the numerics in Fig. 2 . However, an explicit statement of the central limit theorem cannot be readily formulated, since it requires the computation of the variance. We now consider the case in which nodes i and j share a strong tie, that is, G i j = G ji = 1. Similar to the previous analysis, from Eq. (1) we derive P i j = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 )/(n \u2212 1) + \u03b3 /d i and P ji = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 )/(n \u2212 1) + \u03b3 /d j . Defining the neighborhood of node i in the backbone N i G := { j \u2208 V : G i j = 1}, we proceed specializing to the present case the difference between Eqs. (A1) and (A2) at time t. Considering that (1 \u2212 k/x) x\u22121 1/e k , for any x 1 and k > 0, and that d i n \u2212 1, for any i \u2208 V , we compute",
