Even so, the contributions of local production of natural resources and resource-based industrial goods should not be underestimated (Khoo and Tsunekawa 2017) . The economic growth of many Southeast Asian countries was historically based on natural resources including rubber, oil palm, and rice.

Malaysia pioneered the production of raw rubber (the upstream segment of the rubber industry) and intermediate goods (the midstream segment), but its upstream production declined after the 1970s. In contrast, raw rubber production sharply expanded in Thailand, surpassing Malaysia in both production and export by the early 1990s. The development of the downstream segment also contrasts between the two countries. In Malaysia, local manufacturing firms entered the export market of rubber products in the 1980s mainly as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for foreign customers. In the next decades, some of the local firms achieved key technological innovations in downstream activities and became market leaders in rubber products such as disposable medical gloves. In contrast, Thailand's downstream segment was dominated by foreign tire makers. Only recently has Thailand seen the emergence of young innovative entrepreneurs who attempt to emulate the success of their Malaysian counterparts.",

The technological and productive foundations of the Malaysian rubber sector were shaped by a legacy of colonial R&D, government policies for socioeconomic restructuring, and demographic/geographic conditions (relatively small population and narrow land areas). The demographic conditions partially resulted from the government policy implemented after the 1970s. Malaysia's R&D in the rubber industry has a long history. To upgrade the upstream segment, the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM, now renamed the Malaysia Rubber Board, MRB) played a central role. It was established in 1925 by the colonial government against a background of declining and fluctuating rubber price during the 1920s. Not only was rubber an important export commodity for the British Empire, but the revenues it earned were crucial for the budget of British Malaya. Before independence, the RRIM's R&D concentrated on improving methods of cultivation, pest control, processing, and developing high-yielding clones. The RRIM established a laboratory and a library for recording data, archiving research papers, disseminating new knowledge, and providing advice to smallholders (MRB 2000) .",

Some of the beneficiaries of the FELDA program were engaged in the NR production and received technical assistance from the RRIM, as discussed above. 3 Subsequently, however, the deep economic transformation under the New Economic Policy (NEP) brought an unexpected result to the Malaysian rubber sector. The expansion of urban manufacturing industries lured rural Malay youth away from tough and low-paying jobs for the NR production. While the influx of foreign workers dampened the rural wages (Pillai 1992; Rema Devi 1996) , the NEP fostered the sense among Malays that they were entitled to better paying urban jobs (Horii 1990 (Horii , 1991 Iwasa 2005) . Consequently, the NR production was increasingly left in the hands of the aged population, which made the maintenance of high quality and high production difficult in Malaysia.

The IMP II, for instance, aimed at, among others, developing new production methods and new materials for industries, including tires, automobile parts, construction goods, and gloves. For this purpose, public institutions were again engaged in R&D activities; in 1998, the MRB was designated an \"umbrella institution\" that would integrate the RRIM and the MRRDB to conduct joint efforts for rubber R&D.

Their R&D activities have been characterized by entrepreneurial astuteness to pursue niche advantages. In advancing from the initial to higher stages of innovative activities, Top Glove and Kossan showed similar trajectories. Both firms initially acquired basic knowledge and technology from the MRB. At the intermediate stage, they gained from public assistance in the provision of technologies of practical use (Kawano 2017) . However, at the highest upgrading stage, Top Glove and Kossan relied on their own efforts to develop human resources and in-house R&D and to formulate business strategies to secure niche markets in the developing countries or low-income countries not targeted by multinational pharmaceutical companies. In these markets, Top Glove and Kossan operated as original design manufacturers (ODMs) and original brand manufacturers (OBMs). However, they remained in the OEM business to keep cordial relationships with foreign pharmaceutical customers. This is because they understood that glove manufacturing is a niche industry tied to natural resources susceptible to price fluctuations on the one hand and subject to market control by foreign pharmaceutical companies on the other. Top Glove and Kossan departed from the \"catching up\" strategy central to the East Asian development model; their business strategies combined catching up and reaching down to create original development styles. Their development paths indicate alternative ways of acquiring and creating the technological and managerial capacity to innovate (Kawano 2017) .",

Rice being the most important commodity in the Thai economy, neither state nor society paid much attention to rubber except in the southern region. However, when Malaysia diversified into oil palm cultivation, the Thai government foresaw an eventual shortage of rubber in the market and considered the potential for rubber cultivation in North and Northeast Thailand. An experimental plantation was set up in the Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center. The success of this plantation led the government to launch its rubber promotion policy in 1989, encouraging rubber cultivation in the North and Northeast. The first phase of this policy (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) saw the expansion of rubber cultivation by approximately 280,000 rai (44,800 ha) in the Northeast.

However, the adverse political impact of the 1997/98 crisis gave Thaksin Shinawatra a chance to alleviate the urban-rural divide by expanding rubber cultivation as part of overall agrarian development. The Thaksin government adopted a rubber promotion policy called the \"one million rai project\" (especially for the North and Northeast). However, the expansion of rubber-planted areas did not really take off until after 2003. 5 The most difficult problem was the unsuitability of the natural environment. Unlike the South, the North and Northeast of Thailand have lower rainfall, generally insufficient for Hevea brasiliensis (para rubber), the species of rubber tree that requires an annual average rainfall exceeding 1,600 mm. To overcome this obstacle, the government set up four rubber research centers, including Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center and Nong Khai Rubber Research Center in the Northeast area. These centers conducted R&D activities in experimental plantations to create new clones suitable for the new planting areas in the Northeast. The original prototype clone, RRIM 600, was sourced from Malaysia. Experiments with combinations of different types of seeds took a year to produce new prototype clones and seven additional years for selective planting and testing on actual production areas (Interview 5, 6; Fujita 2016).",

However, quite unlike the rise of local firms in Malaysia's glove manufacturing, the emergence of tire manufacturing in Thailand has been led by foreign firms. This difference partially accounts for Thailand's lower performance in the downstream segment in comparison with Malaysia. First of all, the number of domestic rubber manufacturing firms is relatively small in Thailand. Diverse rubber products were manufactured by no more than 216 rubber manufacturers in 2014 (RRIT various years). In contrast, a small number of foreign firms (such as the large tire producers) receive roughly 80-90% of the rubber industry's revenue. In fact, Thailand is the world's second largest producer of examination gloves, having 17% of the market (Nopkit 2017) . The gloves are produced by about 45 foreign and local companies, mainly those located in Southern Thailand (T.R.I. Global 2016) . Even so, foreign companies from Malaysia, China, India, and Australia operate the large facilities producing higher grade products (Interview 4). Moreover, Thai public research institutes are weak in R&D for downstream activities. Facing economic uncertainty, the rising influence of China, and stronger competition from neighboring countries, the Thai rubber industry will need to shift more clearly to high value-added rubber-based manufacturing. To do so, a broader involvement of the government and public research institutes in R&D activities will be required.",

            "text": "Finally, we can obtain certain insights about the economic prospects of resourcerich countries from the experiences of the Malaysian and Thai rubber industries. The existing literature on the danger of the \"middle-income trap\" stresses the importance of knowledge, skills, technology, and institutions, but it tends to focus on high-tech industries in which only a few emerging states can hope to be competitive. However, as the development potential of the rubber industries in Malaysia and Thailand indicates, the standard views of technological upgrading may have overlooked an option open to resource-endowed emerging states to avoid the \"middle-income trap.\" That option is to seek technological upgrading and management improvement in resourcebased industries such as Malaysia's glove manufacturing and Thailand's production and processing of NR. These sectors exploited a common source of strength-rubber as raw material-that is not usually regarded as a part of the East Asian development model. However, each rubber industry succeeded on the basis of mixed state development strategies, public and private R&D, dynamic entrepreneurship, and public-private linkages. Even though the timing of development and sectoral strength are different in the two countries, the rubber industry in both responded innovatively to changes in the structure and direction of the global demand for NR and rubber-based manufactured goods. The result shows how resource-rich emerging states can combine their resource advantages with more accessible technological upgrading and create \"niches\" such as new products, services, quality, and markets.",
