A recent paper by Bharath et al., 2020 reveals that, upon \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 stimulation, purified CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy, lean, older (57\u201368 years) donors produce more TH17-associated/supportive cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-23) than cells from younger (28\u201338 years) subjects. This effect could be inhibited by the addition of a clinically achievable concentration (100 \u03bcM) of metformin, an oral antidiabetic that has multiple effects on aging-related processes and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in the TAME (Targeting Aging by Metformin) trial for its capacity to prevent the manifestation of age-associated diseases (Kulkarni et al., 2020).",

            "text": "In a series of elegant experiments performed on primary CD4+ T cells stimulated with \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28, Bharath et al., 2020 elucidated a plausible mechanism for the old age-associated, metformin-treatable TH17-linked cytokine hyperproducer phenotype (TH17-CHP). Indeed, the overarching cause of TH17-CHP appears to be reduced autophagy of mitochondria, which compromises mitochondrial turnover and quality control, as indicated by an increase in mitochondrial mass, an increase in the proton leak, and a reduction in the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. In addition, mitochondria contained in CD4+ T cells from older donors exhibited an enhanced basic and maximal oxygen consumption, correlating with reduced glycolytic lactate production, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activating phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3, with enhanced STAT3 binding to the promoters of the IL17A and IL17F genes. Metformin reactivated autophagy through an AMPK-independent pathway and reversed most of the aforementioned alterations (Figure 1\nA). Conversely, knockdown of the essential autophagy gene ATG3 (but not that of PINK1, a gene specifically involved in mitophagy) inhibited autophagy in CD4+ T cells from younger subjects, inducing TH17-CHP similar to the one spontaneously found in CD4+ T cells from older donors (Figure 1B). Tempol, a membrane-permeable radical scavenger, was able to reduce some aspects of the TH17-CHP, yet did not show a clear epistasis with respect to metformin, suggesting that tempol-quenchable ROS somehow contribute to, but are not entirely responsible for, the TH17-CHP (Bharath et al., 2020).",

Here, it appears that aging compromises autophagy in CD4+ T lymphocytes to stimulate the secretion of several pro-inflammatory interleukins, thus contributing to inflammaging (Bharath et al., 2020). However, it remains to be determined in preclinical experiments, in mouse models, whether a selective autophagy (or mitophagy) defect solely affecting CD4+ cells would be sufficient to cause TH17-CHP in vivo and accelerate the aging process. As it stands, it appears that autophagy has rather broad anti-inflammatory effects, notably by avoiding the spill of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm (to avoid activation of the cGAS/STING pathway) or by inhibiting excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Galluzzi et al., 2012, Mathur et al., 2018).",

Chronological and biological aging can be dissociated from each other to some extent, meaning that simple metabolic parameters, such as obesity (with the associated metabolic syndrome) and caloric restriction can accelerate and decelerate, respectively, the aging process (Kroemer et al., 2018, L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2016). For this reason, it is important to measure biological age on cell types that are (relatively) accessible such as circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes. At this stage, the methodology developed by Bharath et al., 2020 requires in vitro stimulation of these cells with \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 to reveal differences between CD4+ T cells from older and younger donors. Ever-advancing single-cell \u201comics\u201d approaches might allow researchers to retrieve and characterize blood CD4+ T cells that have been naturally activated in vivo, hoping to confirm the observations by Bharath et al., 2020 on freshly obtained blood samples and to refine the analyses to unprecedented levels by obtaining the sequences (and hence the specificities) of the T cell receptors that contribute to inflammaging. Indeed, it might be highly informative whether TH17-CHP affects all TCR clonotypes in a similar fashion or whether it preferentially occurs in autoreactive T cells.",

Metformin is used at high doses (in the gram per day range), mediates cellular effects at rather elevated concentrations (typically in the \u223c100 \u03bcM range), and influences all hallmarks of aging at multiple levels, including at the level of the intestinal microbiota (Kulkarni et al., 2020). Hence, the pharmacological targets of metformin have not been defined in molecular terms. The finding that metformin can impact the aging-related phenotype of CD4+ T cells in a direct fashion (without an action on the microbiota or on other cell types) might facilitate the search for molecular metformin target(s), hence paving avenues toward the development of other (perhaps more efficient) antiaging molecules.",

In most cases, the immune system of the young eliminates the virus, while older subjects (>60 years) exhibit a reduced antiviral defense, as well as a tendency toward exaggerated inflammatory responses resulting in lethal lung damage (Zhou et al., 2020). Of note, Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has successfully been used to treat some cases of COVID-19-associated pneumonitis (Mehta et al., 2020), establishing a cause-effect relationship between inflammation and organ damage.
