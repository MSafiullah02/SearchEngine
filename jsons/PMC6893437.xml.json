IAV has been responsible for numerous yearly epidemics and for at least four pandemics during the past ~100 years; estimates are that more than 100 million people have died from infection during this time period [1,2]. IAV is a small enveloped virus with a genome of eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA that encode 10\u201315 proteins, depending on the virus strain [3,4,5]. IAV is serologically categorized by two surface proteins: The hemagglutinin (HA), of which there are currently 18 types (H1\u2013H18), and neuraminidase (NA), of which there currently are 11 types (N1\u201311) [3,6].",

There has also been a sporadic but highly lethal spread of H5N1 and H7N9 from birds to humans [9]. Several anti-viral strategies, including small molecule inhibitors and yearly re-formulated vaccines, have been developed to combat IAV, but the virus\u2032 extensive genetic plasticity, caused by an error-prone polymerase and capacity to mix genetic content, often leads to resistance to virus-targeted anti-viral strategies. Because all viruses are obligate parasites, and must therefore make widespread use of host cell machinery, an alternate anti-viral strategy that is being explored would be to elucidate host factors that are required by, and modulated by, the virus, for its successful pathogenicity and propagation.",

Each of these assays identified thousands of cellular proteins, and collectively, these studies have determined dysregulation of various pathways, such as acetylation, cell structure, defense responses, protein binding, responses to stress, stimulus and virus, alternative splicing, localization, transport, protein binding and nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism. However, these non-biased global types of strategies have a few limitations. First, since the more abundant proteins are likely to be identified by MS, the less abundant proteins, many of which play key functions, are more likely to be missed. In addition, there usually is less than 100% overlap between replicate MS-identified samples. Multiplex protein arrays have the potential to overcome such limitations, but most are antibody-based and currently limited to a few hundred analytes.",

Any protein\u2032s Z-score was deemed significant if the average Z-score was >1.96\u03c3 or <\u22121.96 \u03c3, the Z-score satisfied this criterion in at least 2 replicates and trended >\u00bd the same direction in one or fewer replicates. Thus, Z-scores had to be beyond the \u00b11.96\u03c3 limit in both of the PR8 and RV733 analyses. After compiling all proteins deemed significant, we also analyzed levels of fold-changes of the significant proteins, and as described below, applied a fold-change cut-off of 1.50-fold dysregulation (\u22651.50-fold if up-regulated, or \u22640.667-fold if down-regulated) to these proteins for added stringency and to maintain workable numbers of proteins for subsequent bioinformatics and pathway analyses.",

IPA network analyses also revealed differences in how each virus affected common cellular networks. The four highest scoring Networks, based on numbers of focus molecules, were the Cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking, the Antimicrobial response, cell death and survival, inflammatory response, the Cardiovascular system development and function, embryonic development and organismal development and the Post-translational modification, protein degradation and protein synthesis networks. The Cellular movement, hematological system development and function, and the immune cell trafficking network was mildly affected by PR8. No proteins in this network were affected by RV733 or pdm09. Apart from CCL5 and CXCL8, which were both upregulated by both H5N1 and H7N9, many proteins in this network were significantly downregulated by the two avian IAV strains (Figure 3A). The Antimicrobial response, cell death and survival inflammatory response network was most significantly affected by PR8 infection, with numerous upregulated proteins (Figure 3B). This network also was mildly affected by RV733 infection, but not by pdm09 infection. Three focus molecules in this network (CD207, ISG15 and IFNL1) were upregulated and three (IGFBP7, MICA and PGD) were downregulated by H5N1 infection. CD207 was also upregulated and MICA also was downregulated by H7N9 infection, and additionally, LGALS3BP and RSPO2 were downregulated by H7N9 infection. One or more proteins in the Cardiovascular system development and function, embryonic development and organismal development network were upregulated and one or more were downregulated by every virus tested. However, many more proteins (such as FSTL1, IGFBP4, NOTCH and STC) were downregulated by the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses than by any of the H1N1 viruses. Furthermore, HDL was slightly upregulated in every H1N1 network, but downregulated in both the H5N1 and H7N9 networks. Finally, there also were substantial differences in the Post-translational modification, protein degradation and protein synthesis network. Many more proteins (such as CTSA, CTSV, MFGE8 and TNFRSF21) were downregulated by the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses than by any of the H1N1 viruses.

The virus\u2019 genetic make-up of eight segments of single-stranded RNA allows for significant genetic plasticity. Like other RNA viruses that lack genetic proof reading, the highly error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to a high mutation rate (=antigenic drift), and the segmented genomes allows for segment mixing during co-infections, leading to emergence of new isolates (=antigenic shift). Thus, vaccines need to be reformulated each year, and the process of attempting to anticipate future isolates often leads to vaccine mismatch [24], which may be exacerbated by an individual\u2032s immune history [25]. A limited repertoire of anti-viral compounds that either inhibit viral uncoating or viral release, have been approved, but viral mutation quickly arises during outbreaks [26,27]. Thus, there has been increasing interest to identify host factors that the virus may require for replication and pathogenicity to complement strategies that only target the virus. A number of studies, including genome-wide RNAi screens, mRNA microarray screens and yeast 2-hybid assays have identified >1500 cellular targets worthy of further analysis [28,29,30,31].",

[10,34,35]), isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) or tandem mass tags (TMT) (ex. [13,36,37,38]), and label-free methods [39,40,41]. Each of these non-biased techniques provides information about thousands of proteins within complex mixtures, including cell extracts (reviewed in [42,43,44]).

            "text": "Furthermore, there is less than 100% overlap between any two sample runs, whether biologic runs or technical replicates of the same sample. Alternate multiplex assays that target specific proteins have been developed and include the MyriadRBM\u00ae and Luminex\u00ae platforms. Many of these are limited to fewer than 100 proteins that can be simultaneously assayed and measured, although a few, such as those offered by RayBiotech\u00ae, are reported to detect and measure several hundred proteins. Thus, at the time we initiated these studies, we selected an aptamer-based assay reported to reliably detect and measure more than 1000 proteins. These slow-off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers\u00ae) were developed by SomaLogics, Inc., (Boulder, CO, USA) [18,19,20], and have been used to examine cancer biomarkers [45], Alzheimer\u2032s disease biomarkers [46] and biomarkers in IAV-infected clinical nasal secretions [47]. Our pilot studies with the first available version, capable of detecting 1128 proteins, reliably measured differences in influenza PR8-infected A549 cells over a time course. We subsequently used the next-generation SOMAscan version 1.3, which measures >1300 proteins, to measure Zika virus-induced proteomic alterations in Vero cells [23] and in U251 astrocytoma cells [48]. Application of this targeted aptamer-based approach, which was designed primarily to detect low-abundance proteins, thus provides a beneficial complementary approach to the non-biased MS-based approaches that tend to measure more abundant proteins. Comparative analyses of dysregulated proteins we identified in this study to proteins identified in one of our earlier MS-based studies [10,34,35] showed generally good agreement. Two proteins (ISG15 and \u03b2-2-microglobulin) were identified as upregulated by both methods, 75 proteins were determined to not be significantly regulated by both techniques and no proteins were identified as significantly upregulated by one method, but significantly downregulated by the other. Thus, this newer aptamer-based multiplexed system, designed primarily to detect and measure lower abundant proteins, provides complementary data to the more commonly-used MS-based approaches and to assay numerous proteins not normally detected by quantitative MS.",

            "text": "The current study assayed 2\u20133 biologic replicates of five different IAV strains, each compared to mock-infected samples (a total of 14 samples). These virus strains represent a lab-adapted H1N1 strain (PR8), a mild seasonal H1N1 strain related to the A/New Caledonia/20/1999-like clinical isolate (RV733), the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (pdm09), and two strains that show significantly higher pathology in human patients; the H5N1 \u201cBird flu\u201d and the H7N9 strain. All tested virus strains affected the A549 cellular proteome, upregulating some proteins and downregulating other proteins. Although none of the 1310 measurable common cellular proteins was significantly dysregulated by all five viruses, some proteins were similarly dysregulated by multiple viruses. For example, CCL5 was upregulated by PR8, H5N1 and H7N9, and PGAM1 was significantly downregulated by pdm09, H5N1 and H7N9. The five viruses generated three overall patterns of dysregulation, at least as measured by the 1310 proteins that can be assayed by the SOMAscan. PR8 caused an overall general activation, primarily of antimicrobial inflammatory and immune response, as reflected by a large upregulation of more than a dozen proteins, including ISG15, STAT1, OAS1 and downregulation only of PPID. PR8 is a highly lab culture-adapted strain passaged multiple times in mice that is highly virulent in mice, but extremely attenuated in humans. RV733 and pdm09 had very little effect in our A549 cells, as we found in a previous quantitative MS study [13], and are relatively low virulence, despite being well adapted to growth in humans. Both the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, which demonstrate the third pattern (significant downregulation of many more proteins than the other strains, particularly in the antimicrobial response, cardiovascular, and post-translational modification networks), and significant downregulation of many common proteins, are poorly adapted to humans because of their receptor specificity, but when successfully delivered into the lower human respiratory tract, they can be highly virulent. This more profound proteomic effect by these avian-derived viruses also was observed in quantitative transcriptomic [49] and MS studies [13].",

            "text": "Genome-wide RNAi screens and mRNA microarray screens identified >1500 cellular genes and proteins influenza virus may depend upon [28,29,30,31]. For example, Konig and colleagues identified 295 genes that were required for influenza virus replication as defined by replicase activity [29] and Karlas and colleagues identified 287 genes required for replication of two different influenza viruses, including the pdm09 strain [28]. Collectively, these two RNAi screens, also carried out in A549 cells, identified 552 potential genes important for influenza replication, with 30 genes found in common. The low level of overlap between these various RNAi screens has been previously noted [50]. We assessed potential overlap between genes identified in the two Karlas and Konig A549 studies with proteins we could detect and measure in A549 cells with our SOMAscan\u00ae panel. Only four genes/proteins (JUN, KPNB1, MAP2K3 and MDM2) overlapped in all three datasets, and of these, only KPNB1 was significantly altered according to SOMAscan\u00ae; downregulated 1.48-fold by H5N1 infection. Thirty-one additional genes identified by Karlas are in the SOMAscan\u00ae panel; of these, 14 were significantly dysregulated by at least one of our tested viruses. Seven proteins were significantly dysregulated by both H5N1 and H7N9, but <1.35-fold. Only one protein, B2M, was dysregulated >1.35-fold; it was upregulated 2.7-fold and only by PR8 infection. Forty genes identified by Konig, including the four found in all three datasets, are in the SOMAscan\u00ae panel; of these, 12 were significantly dysregulated by at least one of our tested viruses. FGFR4 was dysregulated, but less than 20%, by three viruses; pdm09, H5N1 and H7N9. Only two of the 14 proteins were dysregulated >1.5-fold; APP was downregulated 3.7-fold by H5N1 and 8-fold by H7N9, and FGFR1 was downregulated 2.1-fold by H7N9 infection. The 71 genes/proteins identified by Karlas and/or Konig and that were present in our SOMAscan\u00ae panel represent proteins involved in numerous diverse functions, including cytokines, enzymes, growth factors, transmembrane receptors and many kinases, as do many of the proteins newly identified in this SOMAscan. Thus, these different methods identify a large number of cellular genes and proteins that should be more extensively analyzed as potential targets to ameliorate influenza virus infection.",

Marion and colleagues found some of their most significantly differentially expressed proteins were CTSD, KLK7, MFGE8, MAPK9 and CD27 [47]. MFGE8 (Lactadherin) was significantly downregulated only by H5N1 and H7N9 in our study. Although CTSD (cathepsin D), KLK7 (Kallikrein-7), MAPK9 (Mitogen activated protein kinase 9) and CD27 antigen were not significantly affected by any of our tested viruses, other cathepsin isoforms, CTSV (cathepsin L2) was significantly downregulated by H7N9, and CTSS was significantly upregulated by PR8, KLK5 was upregulated by pdm09, but only 1.4-fold, These differences probably relate to study design; Marion assessed clinical nasal swabs and we examined A549 cell extracts.",
