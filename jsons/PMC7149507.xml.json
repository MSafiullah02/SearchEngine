            "text": "The quasispecies theory of molecular evolution was first proposed to describe the error-prone replication, self-organization, and adaptability of primitive replicons such as those thought to have populated the earth some 4000 million years before the present (Eigen, 1971, 1992; Eigen and Schuster, 1979; see Chapter 1). Quasispecies was formulated initially as a deterministic theory involving mutant distributions of infinite population size in equilibrium. Extensions and generalizations to ensembles of genomes of finite population size replicating in changing environments have been developed (Eigen, 2000; Wilke et al., 2001a, 2001b; Saakian and Hu, 2006). Virologists use the term \u201cviral quasispecies\u201d to mean complex distributions of non-identical but closely related viral genomes subjected to genetic variation, competition and selection, and which act as a unit of selection (reviewed in different chapters of Domingo, 2006). More simple and general, a quasispecies has been defined as a population of similar genomes (Nowak, 2006). Quasispecies dynamics is most clearly manifested in systems such as RNA viruses that display short duplication times, generally high fecundity, and error-prone replication, traits that have been maintained despite a probable ancient origin of most extant RNA viruses in coevolution with a cellular world. Increasing numbers of careful analyses of viral populations have supported quasispecies dynamics for animal and plant RNA viruses (for recent examples see Ge et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007 and references included in these articles; see also other chapters of this book).",

            "text": "As discussed by Villarreal in Chapter 21, there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of RNA viruses and other RNA genetic elements: that they are remnants of an ancient RNA world, or that they are modern derivatives of cells, originated in cellular RNAs that acquired autonomous replication. Viroids and other subviral RNA replicons may be direct descendants of early RNA (or RNA-like) replicons that preceded an organized cellular world (Robertson et al., 1992) (Chapter 2). Cells and viruses share a considerable number of essential functional domains or modules: polymerases, proteases, enzymes involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, etc. However, on the basis of key proteins involved in viral replication, that are absent in cells, and also based on the evidence of extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses, the concept of an ancient virus world has been proposed (Koonin et al., 2006). A primordial pool of genetic elements could have been the ancestor of viral and cellular genes. Cells and viruses share a ubiquitous ability to modify, lose, or acquire new genes or gene segments through genomic rearrangements, insertions, deletions, and other recombination events. Shuffling of functional modules among cells, viruses, and other replicons (plasmids, episomes, transposons, retrotransposons) is probably a frequent occurrence through fusion, transfection, conjugation, and other types of horizontal gene transfers (Botstein, 1980; Hickey and Rose, 1988; Zimmern, 1988; Davis, 1997; Holland and Domingo, 1998; Bushman, 2002). Sequence comparisons strongly suggest that all extant viruses have deep, ancient evolutionary roots (Gorbalenya, 1995; Villarreal, 2005) (Chapter 21).",

The first studies indicated that chemical mutagenesis could increase the mutation frequency by at most three-fold at defined genomic sites of poliovirus (PV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Holland et al., 1990), and 13-fold in the case of a retroviral vector (Pathak and Temin, 1992). Also, increased mutagenesis had an adverse effect on fitness recovery of VSV clones (Lee et al., 1997). These early results suggested that RNA viruses replicate near the error catastrophe threshold, with a copying fidelity that allows a generous production of error copies.",

            "text": "Lethal mutagenesis is attracting increasing interest, and several theoretical models have addressed the mechanisms underlying lethal mutagenesis and the relationship between the observations on viral extinction and the original concept of error catastrophe (several models are reviewed in Chapter 1, and one model is described in Chapter 9). Key to the validation of these models as applied to RNA viruses is the experimental finding that a low viral load and low replicative fitness (relative replication capacity) favor extinction (Sierra et al., 2000; Pariente et al., 2001), and that a mutagenic activity (not merely an inhibitory activity) is necessary to achieve extinction (Pariente et al., 2003). This was shown by absence of extinction when the virus was subjected to equivalent inhibitory activities with cocktails of non-mutagenic inhibitors (Pariente et al., 2003). However, since low viral loads favor extinction, the inhibitory activity that is associated with the action of some mutagenic agents may contribute to lethal mutagenesis. In this respect, a combination of a mutagenic nucleoside analogue and the antiretroviral inhibitor AZT was required to extinguish high fitness HIV-1 during infections in cell culture (Tapia et al., 2005). Even strong reductions in population size of highly debilitated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) populations did not result in virus extinction unless a mutagenic activity intervened (Sierra et al., 2000; Pariente et al., 2001; Pariente et al., 2003). A second finding to be considered in the development of theoretical models is the negative interference exerted by mutants that either coinfect the cells along with standard virus, or are generated inside the cell by mutagenesis. The interfering activity of such \u201cdefector\u201d genomes as contributing to viral extinction has been documented both experimentally with FMDV and LCMV, and by in silico simulations (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b; Perales et al., 2007). Production of a fraction of non-infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected patients as a result of ribavirin (1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,3-triazole-3-carboxamide) therapy is a key parameter in the models of HCV clearance following treatment with ribavirin and interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) (Dixit et al., 2004; Dahari et al., 2007) (see Chapter 15).",

This has been recognized by us (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005a) and others (Perelson and Layden, 2007). Despite this, a genome with a mutation frequency lying in the lower range of typically hypermutated genomes was identified in a population of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated LCMV (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005a). The absence or very low frequency of hypermutated genomes in standard genome samplings of pre-extinction viral populations cannot constitute an argument against a mutagenesis-driven transition into error catastrophe.",

As pointed out by Eigen, \u201cTheory cannot remove complexity, but it shows what kind of \u2018regular\u2019 behavior can be expected and what experiments have to be done to get a grasp on the irregularities\u201d (Eigen, 2002).",

This is physically impossible. As mutagenesis progresses during viral replication myriads of end-point genomes harboring lethal or highly deleterious mutations will impede further expansions into sequence space by such genomes. This is a consequence of the multiple viral functions (not only RNA replication) that affect replicative competence (Eigen, 2002). These differences between the mechanisms that mediate extinction of real viruses and the original concept of error catastrophe can be expressed by distinguishing \u201cphenotypic\u201d and \u201cextinction\u201d thresholds from an \u201cerror theshold,\u201d as has been done in some theoretical treatments (for example, Huynen et al., 1996; Manrubia et al., 2005). Apart from these rather obvious adaptations of error catastrophe to a real biological system, the experimental studies carried out in the laboratory of one of us (E.D.) do not provide any basis to dissociate lethal mutagenesis from error catastrophe, as initially developed by Eigen, Schuster, and colleagues, and even less to consider that the approach to error catastrophe will impede viral extinction. In the section on \u201cIntra-mutant spectrum suppression can contribute to lethal mutagenesis\u201d in this chapter, we summarize our current view on the mechanisms that underlie virus extinction through lethal mutagenesis based on experimental results, and the main challenges facing, in our view, this new antiviral strategy.",

The mutant PV produces a narrower mutant spectrum (with a lower average number of mutations per genome) than wild-type PV. In infections of susceptible mice (transgenic for the human PV receptor) the mutant replicated in the animals but failed to reach the brain and to produce the neuropathology that was associated with the infection with wild-type PV (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006). Remarkably, restoration of the standard mutant spectrum complexity by subjecting the mutant PV to 5-FU-induced mutagenesis led to a neuropathogenic mutant spectrum (Vignuzzi et al., 2006). Moreover, Sabin's attenuated PV vaccine shows relatively low mutant frequency compared with wild-type strains, and this observation could be due to differences in polymerase fidelity (Vignuzzi, personal communication; see also Chapter 6). These observations are highly relevant (Biebricher and Domingo, 2007). Foremost, the results show the biological relevance of high mutation rates, in that they may affect pathology by allowing the virus to reach specific target organs, thereby increasing viral loads and chances of transmission. The observed phenotypic transitions of PV demand consideration of the virus as a quasispecies, since PV behavior could not be explained by taking into account consensus genomic nucleotide sequences alone. We come to the conclusion that virus evolution can affect viral pathogenesis in at least two ways (Domingo, 2007): (i) The information for increased pathology or for adaptation to multiple environments can be contained in the genetic material of the virus (in most of its individual clones) irrespective of the mutant spectrum to which they belong (Kimata et al., 1999; Greene et al., 2005, among other examples). (ii) The information for increased pathology can be contained in a distribution of mutants as such, as documented above for HCV and PV. Again, these observations reinforce the biological advantage of high mutation rates for the long-term survival of RNA viruses, and the consideration of entire quasispecies as the units of selection (see also Domingo, 2006, 2007, and other chapters of this volume).",

The amino acid replacement in the polymerase (G64S) is located away from the catalytic domain of the enzyme, and an action at a distance was invoked to explain the general effect of this substitution on the copying fidelity (Arnold et al., 2005) (see Chapter 6). A mutant of FMDV, selected also by passaging the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin, displayed higher fitness than the wild-type virus when virus replication took place in the presence of ribavirin but not in its absence (Sierra et al., 2007). This phenotypic change was mapped to amino acid substitution M296I in the viral polymerase, and the mutant enzyme displayed decreased capacity to use ribavirin triphosphate as substrate (instead of GTP or ATP), but did not show an apparent alteration of general template-copying fidelity (Sierra et al., 2007). Substitution M296I is located at a loop whose flexibility seems to be required to adapt its conformation and interactions to the size and shape of template residues and incoming nucleotide substrates. Ile at this position may restrict the loop flexibility and affect nucleotide recognition (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2007). M296 is quite distant from the site (G62) where the equivalent, ribavirin-selected substitution in PV lays. These results suggest that in the picornaviral polymerase multiple sites (perhaps domains) might be involved either in specific interactions with nucleotide analogues or in recognition of nucleotide substrates.",

Several interactions are key to catalysis, as shown by modification of the polymerase activity of the corresponding mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, some interactions are common to standard nucleotides and nucleotide analogues, while other interactions are specific for a given nucleotide analogue (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2007). These results suggest that multiple sites in the polymerase can modulate substrate recognition, thereby affecting the fidelity properties of picornaviral (and probably other) polymerases (Arnold et al., 2005; Ferrer-Orta et al., 2007). These and other recent studies on the mechanism of substrate discrimination by viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases are providing important information that may help in the design of drugs able to lower the copying fidelity of viral polymerases to facilitate lethal mutagenesis (see also Chapter 6).",

            "text": "Populations of RNA viruses subjected to increased mutagenesis by nucleoside analogues display decreases in specific infectivity due to accumulation of viral genomes harboring deleterious or lethal mutations (Crotty et al., 2001; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2002, 2005b; Airaksinen et al., 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004, 2005; Arias et al., 2005). Mutagenized, pre-extinction FMDV RNA interfered with the replication of standard FMDV RNA, resulting in a delay and in a decrease in the production of progeny virus (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004). Since the interfering FMDV displayed at least a 0.1-fold fitness relative to the standard FMDV (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2005), the suppression observed could not be due to mechanisms invoking competition between genomes of comparable replication capacity (such as positive clonal interference). It was suggested that the expression (normal or aberrant) of altered viral proteins could contribute to the suppression of replication of standard FMDV, and also to the extinction of FMDV RNA. To test this hypothesis, a number of capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV were examined regarding their capacity to interfere with standard FMDV, in experiments involving coelectroporation of cells with the relevant RNAs (Perales et al., 2007). The results showed that an excess of several replication-competent mutants caused a strong and specific interference on FMDV replication. Furthermore, mixtures of some capsid and polymerase mutants evoked a very strong, synergistic interference (Perales et al., 2007). Notably, some of the mutants tested had been isolated from mutagenized FMDV populations in their way towards extinction. These results with FMDV are in agreement with observations on enhanced mutagenesis of LCMV which resulted in populations in which the loss of infectious progeny production preceded the loss of replicating viral RNA (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b). A deleterious effect on infectivity exerted by defective LCMV genomes was also supported by numerical simulations using realistic parameters of LCMV replication (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b).",

            "text": "The picture emerging from the studies with FMDV and LCMV is that the transition towards viral extinction associated with lethal mutagenesis can have at least two phases: an initial one, with a limited input of mutations in the viral genomes, in which a subset of defective genomes that have been termed \u201cdefectors\u201d interfere with replication of standard genomes, and can contribute to viral extinction. This is termed the \u201clethal defection model\u201d of virus extinction, proposed on the basis of experiments with LCMV (Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b), and supported by the strong interference on FMDV replication exerted by combinations of specific capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV (Perales et al., 2007). In a second phase, as the number of mutations per genome increases due to continuing mutagenesis, the proportion of lethal mutations increases, resulting in further decreases in specific infectivity (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2005; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b). In Chapter 6, Cameron and colleagues describe elegant experiments that show that low-fidelity mutants of poliovirus manifest an acceleration of the onset of lethal mutagenesis. Genomes with either deleterious or lethal mutations have been isolated from mutagenized FMDV and LCMV populations on their way towards extinction (Sierra et al., 2000; Pariente et al., 2001; Arias et al., 2005). Some detrimental mutations may be maintained in the viral populations by complementation and whenever the genomes harboring them increase in frequency they may exert an interfering activity provided that the type of genetic lesion belongs to the interfering class (Perales et al., 2007). Interestingly, some genomes harboring multiple mutations (for example a triple mutant in the polymerase of FMDV) that render the genome replication-incompetent may differ in a single nucleotide position from a replication-competent, strongly interfering mutant (Arias et al., 2005; Perales et al., 2007). Viral genomes with interfering or lethal mutations may occupy proximal or distant positions in sequence space, relative to the standard, non-mutated genome. Thus, there might be a gradual but overlapping transition between a phase of dominance of interfering mutants and a phase of increasing presence of lethal mutants, until a replicative collapse and virus extinction occur, in agreement with the theory of error catastrophe (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the contribution of lethal mutants to error catastrophe). Recent biochemical data have documented that viral proteins are frequently multifunctional and that they often form oligomeric complexes. Thus, mutated forms of a given protein may affect multiple viral functions and result in inactive protein complexes (several examples can be found in Mesters et al., 2006; Sobrino and Mettenleiter, 2008). Abnormal behavior of altered viral proteins may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus transition into error catastrophe, very much in line with the cascade of events initially proposed as a model for aging (Orgel, 1963).",

            "text": "The transition of FMDV and LCMV towards extinction by lethal mutagenesis occurred with a 102- to 103-fold decrease in specific infectivity (PFU/total viral RNA), and without a modification of the consensus sequence of the population (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005a) in agreement with results with poliovirus (Crotty et al., 2001). Loss of infectivity was very sharp, and extinction occurred generally after 1\u201320 passages, depending on viral fitness and the mutagen-inhibitor combination treatment (compare the extinction kinetics in Sierra et al., 2000; Pariente et al., 2001, 2003; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005a). Extinction can be preceded by minimal increase in the average mutation frequency of the mutant spectra (Crotty et al., 2001; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005b; Tapia et al., 2005). These experiments have not provided evidence that as the mutational load in the viral genome increases, the virus acquires resistance to extinction. It remains to be seen whether the presence of M296I in the FMDV RdRp, which was selected by ribavirin, confers any significant resistance to lethal mutagenesis. The vulnerability of FMDV to extinction by lethal mutagenesis offers a significant contrast with the resistance of FMDV to extinction despite accumulation of mutations as a result of plaque-to-plaque transfers (Escarmis et al., 2002, 2008; Lazaro et al., 2003). The key difference between the two scenarios is that resistance to extinction (despite accumulation of mutations accompanying serial bottleneck events) results from the selection for a next transfer of a virus able to replicate thanks to the presence of compensatory mutations. This is in contrast to mutagenesis of a complex population whose suppressive effects do not allow the rescuing of replication-competent individuals (Manrubia et al., 2005).",

Clarification of the mechanisms underlying virus extinction may help in the design of improved protocols of administration of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors for lethal mutagenesis. In our view, the main challenges facing progress in lethal mutagenesis are: (i) finding and design of new mutagenic base or nucleoside analogues that target viral (but not cellular) polymerases, that can be used in combination with antiviral inhibitors; (ii) evaluation of how widespread is the occurrence of mutagen-resistant virus mutants, and whether lethal mutagenesis may fail either because of the presence of mutagen-resistant mutations (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003) Sierra et al., 2007) or other mechanisms (Sanjuan et al., 2007); (iii) understanding of the molecular basis of template-copying fidelity of nucleic acid polymerases, and the design of drugs that can lower specifically the copying fidelity of viral polymerases; (iv) the application of lethal mutagenesis to model systems in vivo (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2003a; Harris et al., 2005). Concerning possible applications of lethal mutagenesis in vivo, measurements of the \u201ccritical drug efficacy\u201d\u2014as developed for treatments of infections by HIV-1 and HCV (Callaway and Perelson, 2002; Y.

Debilitated viral clones often gain fitness even when subjected to considerable bottlenecking (Novella et al., 1995a, 1995c). Rather constant, stable fitness values could be attained by choosing the appropriate bottleneck size, although occasional fitness jumps were observed (Novella et al., 1996).",

(1996, 2008) examined the genetic lesions associated with M\u00fcller's ratchet by determining genomic nucleotide sequences of FMDV clones prior to and after undergoing repeated (up to 409) plaque-to-plaque transfers. The result was that fitness loss was associated with unusual mutations that had never been seen in natural FMDV isolates or laboratory populations subjected to passages involving large viral populations. Particularly striking were an internal polyadenylate extension preceding the second functional AUG initiation codon of the FMDV genome, and amino acid substitutions at internal capsid residues. Additions or deletions of nucleotides have been frequently observed at homopolymeric tracts, particularly on pyrimidine runs in templates copied by proofreading-repair-deficient polymerases (Kunkel, 1990; Bebenek and Kunkel, 1993). The experimental results suggest that only when the repeated bottlenecks limit the action of negative selection (elimination or decrease in proportion of low fitness genomes) can such internal polyadenylate extensions (and other deleterious mutations) be maintained in the FMDV genome (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1996, 2006). In contrast, sequence analysis of VSV genomes subjected to plaque-to-plaque passages did not show unusual mutations, with the possible exception of mutations in the RNA termini, which are uncommon in viruses evolving in regimes of acute replication (Novella and Ebendick-Corpus, 2004).",

In the case of plaque-to-plaque transfers of a virus this type of distribution probably results from the multiple host\u2013virus interactions that occur as the virus life cycle is completed, and alterations of such interactions as mutations accumulate in multifunctional viral proteins (Lazaro et al., 2003).

            "text": "Fitness has often been considered a component of parasite virulence, defined as the capacity of parasites to inflict damage upon their hosts. Indeed, very frequently an increase in viral fitness parallels an increase of virulence. However, a comparative quantitative analysis of fitness and virulence (cell-killing capacity) of an FMDV clone subjected to plaque-to-plaque transfers, and of its parental clone, revealed that fitness and virulence can be two unrelated traits (Herrera et al., 2007). The molecular basis for the different trajectories followed by fitness and virulence resided in the fact that fitness was affected by mutations anywhere in the viral genome while determinants of cell-killing capacity were multigenic but restricted to some specific genomic regions of the viral genome. As a consequence, the random accumulation of mutations associated with bottleneck transfers had a more negative impact on fitness than on virulence of this FMDV clone (Herrera et al., 2007). That viral fitness and virulence can follow different trajectories is supported by several observations with animal and plant viruses. VSV populations that were subjected to a regime of persistent infection in sandfly cells showed overall decrease in both fitness and virulence in mammalian cells, but the decrease in virulence continued throughout the experiment, while the decrease in fitness peaked at intermediate passages and was followed by some degree of recovery (Z\u00e1rate and Novella, 2004). Simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 attains similar high viral loads in the sooty mangabey and the rhesus macaque, yet it is only virulent for the rhesus macaque (Kaur et al., 1998). At an epidemiological level, greater fitness of historical versus current HIV-1 isolates was taken as evidence of HIV-1 attenuation over time, assuming a direct correlation between fitness and virulence (Arien et al., 2005). However, no trend towards HIV-1 attenuation since the time of introduction of the virus into Switzerland was observed (Muller et al., 2006). These and other studies with viral and non-viral parasites (reviewed in Herrera et al., 2007) suggest that evolution in nature can drive parasites to attain virulence levels that are not necessarily coupled to fitness. This distinction between fitness and virulence should be taken into consideration in the formulation of models for parasite virulence.",

This limiting high fitness level was manifested by stochastic fluctuations in fitness values expected from random generation of mutations in a continuously evolving mutant swarm. These perturbations illustrate how difficult it is to attain a true population equilibrium even when viruses replicate in a constant environment. A rare combination of mutations\u2014one that may occur only once over many rounds of viral replication\u2014may transfer one genome and its descendants to a distant region of sequence space, and trigger the dominance of one viral subpopulation over another, thereby disrupting a period of population equilibrium. In competitions between two VSV clones of similar fitness coexisting at or near equilibrium, a rapid and unpredictable displacement of one VSV population by the other (Clarke et al., 1994) provided support for a classical concept of population biology: the competitive exclusion principle (Gause, 1971). Furthermore, in the competition passages preceding mutual exclusion, both the winners and the losers gained fitness at comparable rates, in support of yet another concept of population genetics: the Red Queen hypothesis (Van Valen, 1973; Clarke et al., 1994; reviewed in Domingo, 2006) (see Figure 4.1).",

Memory has been documented with a number of genetic markers of FMDV (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2000, 2002, 2003b) and HIV-1 (Briones et al., 2003, 2006), and similar results have been described for VSV (Novella et al., 2007). Memory is a consequence of fitness variations inherent to quasispecies dynamics, likely to exert its main influence on the composition of mutant spectra that have been subjected to various alternating selective pressures (Domingo, 2000).",

These studies have provided evidence of a continuous dynamics of generation of defective FMDV genomes harboring in-frame internal deletions within genomic regions encoding trans-acting proteins, giving rise to swarms of genomes with non-identical, related deletions (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2006). Each virion encapsidates only one type of defective genome and, therefore, the same cell must be infected by at least two different particles to permit complementation and formation of progeny defective genomes (Manrubia et al., 2006;. The high m.o.i.-dependent evolution of FMDV towards two defective forms that can complement each other has been regarded as experimental support of a first step in a process towards viral genome segmentation. Interestingly, multipartite segmented genomes are rare among the animal and bacterial viruses but are frequent among plant viruses, and the latter are characterized by high m.o.i. as they spread in their host plants (Lazarowitz, 2007).",

Once adaptation has taken place, the adapted virus may lose or maintain the pathogenic potential for the former (donor) host (as an example of maintenance of virulence for a donor and recipient host in FMDV see Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2007). A core (or basal) genetic composition of a viral pathogen may be in itself a predictor of pathogenic potential, as profusely documented with natural or laboratory-generated, attenuated variants of many viral pathogens. To take influenza A virus and the threat of a human influenza pandemics as examples, out of the 16 hemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes circulating among animal reservoirs, some potentially threatening forms being more carefully kept under surveillance include H5 N1, H7N7, H9N2, and H2N2 viruses. The expansion of the H5N1 subtype among wild and domestic avian species and human contacts since 2005 has resulted in over 300 human cases in nearly 50 countries, with more than 50% deaths, as well as the killing of millions of poultry (Wright et al., 2007). Key parameters for an avian influenza virus to give rise to a human influenza pandemic include acquisition of receptor-recognition specificity for human cells, and the capacity for efficient human-to-human transmission (Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005; Suzuki, 2005). This capacity can be expressed as the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) which is the average number of infected contacts from each infected host (review in Nowak and May, 2000). \u201cEpidemiologic fitness\u201d has been used to describe (through samplings of definitory genomic sequences, diagnostic surveys, etc.) the capacity of a virus to become dominant (relative to related viruses or variants) during epidemic outbreaks (Domingo, 2007). In the case of human influenza virus, the acquisition of high epidemiological fitness depends on multiple gene products. Critical substitutions in H may modify the receptor-binding specificity of influenza viruses, and such substitutions have been found in minority subpopulations of influenza virus in several surveys. In one study, two substitutions in H identified in a human influenza virus from a fatal human case, were shown to modify the receptor-binding preference of H of a H5N1 virus from sialic acid-\u03b12,3 galactose (associated with replication in avian hosts) to both sialic acid-\u03b12,3 galactose and sialic acid-\u03b12,6 galactose, both associated with binding to human-type receptors, each expressed preferentially in different sites of the human respiratory tract (Auewarakul et al., 2007). Thus, in influenza virus, and probably many other pathogenic viruses, both epidemiologic fitness and replicative fitness are multigenic traits (Grimm et al., 2007).",

In one such proteomics survey, several amino acid changes located in PB2, PA, NP, M1, and NS1 distinguished avian influenza viruses from their human counterparts (Finkelstein et al., 2007). Some markers were conserved in the influenza viruses that caused the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics. Other studies have identified HA and PB2 as critical for adaptation of avian virus to humans, that may occur by a step-wise process reflected in acquisition of diagnostic amino acid markers. Evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza virus H5N1 has been obtained in some family case clusters but not in others (Yang et al., 2007). Influenza constitutes the paradigm of a viral disease which, favored by a continuum of genetic variation, reemerges periodically to cause pandemics, and for which extensive epidemiological surveillance is currently in operation.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of AZT (3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine, zidovudine) as an effective inhibitor of HIV replication (Mitsuya et al., 1985), drug therapy has been widely used in the treatment of AIDS. The loss of therapeutic effect due to the acquisition of resistance was recognized for AZT in 1989, when Larder and colleagues showed that HIV isolates from patients with advanced HIV disease became less sensitive to the drug during the course of treatment (Larder et al., 1989). High-level resistance to AZT is achieved through the accumulation of several mutations including M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E (for a review, see Larder, 1994). The first substitution arising during AZT treatment is usually K70R, followed by T215Y. The K70R mutation appears frequently, since it requires only one nucleotide change, and does not have a major impact on viral fitness (Harrigan et al., 1998). The simultaneous presence of Leu41 and Tyr215 in the viral RT-coding region confers high-level resistance to AZT, without having a major effect on viral fitness. In contrast, other combinations of AZT resistance mutations (e.g. M41L/K70R) confer reduced replication capacity (Jeeninga et al., 2001). Interestingly, transmitted HIV-1 carrying D67N or K219Q evolve rapidly to AZT resistance in vitro (selecting for K70R) and show a high replicative fitness in the presence of zidovudine (Garc\u00eda-Lerma et al., 2004). On the other hand, L210W improved infectivity and relative fitness of an M41L/T215Y mutant in the presence of AZT, but decreased infectivity and relative fitness when introduced into a D67N/K70R/K219Q background (Hu et al., 2006).",

Early studies showed that multiple drug resistance to AZT and other inhibitors can be achieved through the accumulation of mutations appearing in monotherapy (Schmit et al., 1996; Shafer et al., 1998). However, the response of a viral quasispecies to multiple constraints (e.g. different antiviral drugs) is often difficult to predict. Simultaneous treatment with AZT and ddI led to viruses with reduced sensitivity to AZT, ddC, ddI, ddG, and d4T (Shirasaka et al., 1995; Iversen et al., 1996). The resistant viruses contained substitutions A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151 M. Substitution Q151 M, which results from two nucleotide changes, is the first to appear and confers partial resistance to AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T. Fitness assays involving the determination of replication kinetics or growth competition experiments showed that mutations at codons 62, 75, 77, and 116 improved the replication capacity of the resistant virus (Maeda et al., 1998; Kosalaraksa et al., 1999).",

Thus, HIV-1 variants with insertions or deletions in the \u201cfingers\u201d subdomain of the RT have been found in patients failing therapy with multiple RT inhibitors (Mas et al., 2000; for a recent review, see Men\u00e9ndez-Arias et al., 2006). The presence of the amino acid changes T69S and T215Y in the RT, together with a dipeptide insertion between positions 69 and 70 (usually Ser-Ser), and the subsequent accumulation of additional mutations (e.g. M41L, A62V, T69S, and K70R) leads to the emergence of virus displaying high-level resistance to thymidine analogues (Matamoros et al., 2004; Cases-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2007). Dual infection/competition experiments revealed that in the presence of low concentrations of AZT, removal of the two serine residues forming the dipeptide insertion in a multidrug-resistant isolate does not cause a detrimental effect on the replication capacity of the virus (Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu et al., 2002). However, in the absence of drug, the insertions improved the fitness of virus-carrying thymidine analogue mutations (e.g. M41L, L210W, T215Y, etc.). Although, multidrug-resistant mutants are able to maintain high viral loads in the presence of antiretroviral therapy, it should be noted that in vivo wild-type HIV variants outcompete those bearing the insertion, as demonstrated when therapy is interrupted (Briones et al., 2000; Lukashov et al., 2001).",

Crystallographic studies of the mutant enzyme revealed that substitutions at codons 82 and 84 were critical for the acquisition of resistance, while the amino acid changes at codons 46 and 63, which are away from the inhibitor-binding site appear as compensatory mutations (Chen et al., 1995; Schock et al., 1996). Although compensatory mutations within the PR-coding region increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, there are other molecular mechanisms that lead to fitness recovery during PR inhibitor treatments. Examples are: (i) mutations at Gag cleavage sites that increase polyprotein processing (Doyon et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1997; Pettit et al., 2002), (ii) mutations that affect the frameshift signal between the gag and pol genes that lead to an increased expression of pol products (Doyon et al., 1998), or (iii) mutations outside of the cleavage sites that could affect the conformation of the Gag polyprotein and make the cleavage sites more accessible to the viral PR (Gatanaga et al., 2002; Myint et al., 2004).",

The amino acid sequences found at those positions in drug-sensitive viruses (DIV, SIV, GIV, or GIM) are replaced by SIM, DIM, or DTV in the drug-resistant clones (Rimsky et al., 1998). As observed with PR and RT inhibitors, resistance mutations cause a fitness loss, which was estimated to be approximately 10% in replication kinetics and growth competition experiments (Lu et al., 2004; Reeves et al., 2005). However, it should be noted that mutations in the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 can also affect the viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide (Reeves et al., 2002;, and further studies will be necessary to evaluate its impact on viral fitness in vivo.\n",

Initial reports of extremely high error rates and great population diversity of RNA viruses were hotly disputed as being incorrect and inconsistent with often-observed stability in virus markers such as antigenicity, disease characteristics, host range, etc. High error rates and intra-population heterogeneity for RNA viruses are now widely accepted. Fortunately, early quasispecies theory presented a timely, remarkably prescient theoretical framework within which the behavior of replicating and evolving RNA virus populations could begin to be understood. Following elaboration by Eigen, Biebricher, Schuster, and colleagues, quasispecies-derived theory has been rapidly progressing and evolving. Its ground-breaking initial theoretical structure for exploring consequences of extreme biological error rates was informed by elegant molecular replication/mutation kinetic studies with small RNA replicons in vitro. Original quasispecies theory was formally applicable to these in vitro experiments, and was necessarily generalized, idealized, and, in many specifics, openly unrealistic for real viruses. Some simplifying assumptions not applicable to viruses in the real world include: infinite virus populations; global optima in the selective landscape; one most-fit master sequence in a single, unvarying selective landscape; fitness restricted to competition solely between one master sequence and diverse variants of equally low fitness; and, finally, omission of complexities such as replicative interference, lethal mutations, complementation, recombination, etc.",

Quasispecies theory has indisputably led virology to powerful new insights, deductions, and directions. A few critics have suggested that the non-real world parameters in early quasispecies models, and the non-realistic (and foregone) conclusions that can be contrived from them, are reason to reject the general validity and broad significance of quasispecies. Such circular arguments are specious and trivial relative to the experimental and conceptual advances already-made, and yet-to-be-made, via quasispecies theory with its straightforward conclusions and more subtle implications.",

Prolonged violation of this threshold (through replicase dysfunction, mutagens, elevated temperatures, nucleotide pool alterations, etc.) leads to virus extinction via a fast and irreversible transition, that has sometimes been equated with a phase transition in physics, as discussed in the opening chapter of this volume. Because the simplified model employed non-realistic parameters and envisioned indefinite mutational drift, critics deny the existence of error thresholds and sharp transitions to error catastrophe. No real-world virus could conform to the simplifying assumptions employed in that model, but recent data from lethal mutagenesis experiments do demonstrate devolution to error catastrophe. Historical precedent for the term \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d lies with Orgel's suggestion in 1963 of cascading coordinate collapse of cellular information within (and between) various interdependent cellular nucleic acid and protein trans-networks. We also employ the term in a broad manner for lethal mutagenesis. This is especially appropriate with mutagens such as 5-FU (which modify both viral and cellular nucleic acids and their encoded functions and structures). We cannot presently rule out some roles for mutagenized cellular, as well as viral, macromolecules, during lethal mutagenesis. Regardless, complex interactions of altered viral macromolecular networks are definitely involved. Extinction is mediated by \u201ctrans-acting networks\u201d among abundant lethal defector genomes. The senior author's group in Madrid demonstrated (reviewed above) that strongly mutagenized RNA virus populations do collapse to extinction via a sharp transition, but without the non-lethal, continuous mutational drift exemplified in the original quasispecies simulations. Extremely rapid extinctions are observed for low-fitness input virus strains, which transition into error catastrophe during a single round of infection/mutagenesis. Lethal mutagenesis of FMDV and LCMV is mediated by full-length, replicating, interfering, lethal defector genomes. Total (defective and viable) genomic RNA mutation frequencies are elevated to varying extents, whereas specific infectivity of total genomic RNA is decreased by several orders of magnitude without any change of RNA consensus sequence. In light of quasispecies \u201cvariant-ensemble\u201d behavior, it is not surprising that defective genomes can predominate within trans-acting networks during lethal mutagenesis, and continue to replicate even after extinction of LCMV infectivity. Defector trans-effects can provide positive complementation in concert with, or alternation with, (orthogonal) interference. Standard concepts of virus fitness are only tangentially applicable within such collapsing trans-networks. Catastrophic decay of viral digital information proceeds on (at least) two levels: (1) genetic quenching due to egregious fixation of genomic mutations in a trans-network environment that does not always select for optimal function of self-encoded proteins, and (2) phenotypic trans-quenching of potentially viable genomes via altered, defector-encoded (interfering) proteins. Possible roles of RNA recombination remain to be explored.",

During lethal mutagenesis at high multiplicities of infection, each infected cell is a single compartment in which a separate, discrete error catastrophe event may devolve. Each discrete trans-network is disrupted and obscured during virus passages or RNA transfections following initial infection/mutagenesis. Multiplicity of infection (for both viable and defector virions) is clearly a crucial variable during passages. Virus strains with low replicative fitness (and mutagen-debilitated genomes) theoretically should be (and are) more vulnerable than highly fit strains to defector-mediated error catastrophe. Low-fitness strains cannot quickly produce high yields during temporary escape from defector networks. Future investigations with controlled compartmentalization (e.g. characterization of isolated infectious centers, microinjection of single cells, etc.), together with molecular genetic construction/reconstruction of defined trans-networks will illuminate pre-extinction events.",

This provides strong analogies to events during the transitions of lethal mutagenesis. The compelling differences, of course, are that the latter devolve to extinction due to: (1) mutagen-elevated mutation, AND elevated mutation-fixation rates in a poorly-selective trans-milieu; (2) potent trans-quenching of surviving-and-collapsing infectious virus via interfering (lethal defector-encoded) proteins.",
