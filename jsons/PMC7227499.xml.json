Therefore, with the exception of cancer and emergency cases, all major surgical and endoscopic procedures were postponed until after May 2020, with a view for further postponement as the situation unfolded.

On a weekly rotational basis, teams took turns to perform inpatient duties while the other two teams performed outpatient tasks. To ensure safety, teams adhered to strict working hours to ensure adequate rest to reduce error rates and prevent burnout. This was especially so for the emergency teams, who would be on 24-h shifts every other day.

Outpatient visits fell by 43%, from 7842 in 2019 to 4482 visits in our study period (Fig. 2\na).

Median wait time from listing to elective surgery rose from 23.2 days in 2019 to 60 days or more at present (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, Operating Room (OR) utilization rates for this period dropped from 66% in 2019 to 52% (Fig. 2c).",
