Clinical signs caused by PDCoV resemble those with two viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, including porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) , but severity of clinical disease is lesser and piglet mortality is lower. PEDV and TGEV infect pigs of all ages and cause 100% morbidity, with 80%-100% mortality rates in piglets. The higher severity of PEDV and TGEV infection in pigs indicates that the two viruses are more suitable for infecting pigs. On the other hand, PDCoV may not be perfectly adapted to pigs, and the virus may be evolving towards better ability to infect a specific host. Recently, an experimental study in calves suggested that calves are susceptible to infection by PDCoV but not PEDV (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2017) .",

            "text": "The full-length genome of PDCoV is approximately 25 kb in length and contains seven essential genes, including open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and specific accessory genes including non-structural protein 6 (Nsp6) and Nsp7, flanked by a 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) (Woo et al., 2012) . ORF1a and ORF1b, occupying twothirds of the genome, encode 2 overlapping viral replicase/transcriptase polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are cleaved into 15 Nsps, namely Nsp2-16 (Zhang & Yoo, 2016) . The S gene encodes S protein which consists of two domains called S1 and S2 domain. The S1 domain plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors and contains a neutralizing epitope. The S2 domain functions in membrane fusion (Shang et al., 2018) . The E and M genes are transmembrane proteins associated with viral envelope formation and virus release (Woo et al., 2010) . On the other hand, the functions of the N gene are associated with viral RNA replication and pathogenesis (Lee & Lee, 2015) .",

The full-length genome is deposited in GenBank with accession number KX361345. The PDCoV-positive samples were subjected to virus isolation using swine testicular (ST) cells (ATCC CRL-1746). The viral isolation was approved by Institutional Biosafety Committee of Chulalongkorn University (CU-IBC) (IBC 1831062). In brief, ST cells were seeded in T25 flasks (Corning, NY, USA) containing Advanced Minimum Essential Medium (adv. MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 1% L-glutamine (Gibco) and 0.0001% pancreatin from porcine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich) for each viral inoculation.After the cells reached 80% confluency, the cells were inoculated with each virus at a titre of 10 3 TCID 50 /ml.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was genetically diverse. The six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were grouped in the SEA cluster together with the Vietnam (Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015), Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates which all have an amino acid deletion at positions 401 to 402 and 758 to 760 located in the ORF1a gene. However, the six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were separated into two sub-clusters recognized as SEA-1 and SEA-2. Two of six isolates were clustered in SEA-1 together with Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates while other four isolates were clustered in SEA-2 together with Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015 isolates. Due to a separated origin, the findings from the present study suggest there were at least 2 possible external introductions of PDCoV into Vietnam. As we mentioned earlier, the Vietnam PDCoV isolated in 2016 (P19_16_VN_0416 and P20_16_VN_0416) shares high degree of genetic similarities and was clustered together with Thai and Lao PDCoV in subgroup SEA-1, the virus isolates might be introduced from these neighbouring countries. Secondly, the external introduction of US-related PDCoV was also observed. This introduction seemed to influence the evolution of Vietnam PDCoV as evidenced by chimeric PDCoV in subgroup SEA-2. The Vietnam PDCoV isolates detected in 2014 (P12_VN_14_0814) were clustered together with other Vietnam PDCoV isolates, HaNoi6/2015 and Binh21/2015, in subgroup SEA-2. The HaNoi6/2014 isolate was detected in Ha Noi province in the northern region of Vietnam since October 2015 and considered as recombinant virus between Thai and China isolates (Le et al., 2018). This study shows the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate shares 100% similarities with the HaNoi6/2014 isolate which means the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate could be also recombinant virus between Thai and China isolates. Interestingly, three of other four isolates in subgroup SEA-2 were different. The P29_15_VN_1215, P30_15_VN_1215 and P1_16_VN_0116 isolates were confirmed to be chimeric virus which were a recombination between Vietnam PDCoV (P12_VN_14_0814), the major parent, and US PDCoV (USA/Minnesota159/2014), the minor parent. As previous reports, the recombination in RNA virus occurs when a host cell is infected with at least two viral genomes at the same time and affects host cell tropism, immune evasion, virulence and pathogenesis (Martin et al., 2011; Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011).

However, phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene demonstrated contradictory results, since Vietnam PDCoV was clustered in the US group. The findings implied that Vietnam PDCoV could potentially be a recombinant virus. Whether or not this genotype of PDCoV isolates predominantly existing in Vietnam remains not known. We therefore conducted a retrospective study investigating the presence of PDCoV in intestinal samples collected from pigs less than 5 days old experiencing severe diarrhoea, in Vietnam from 2011 to 2016.

It is remained to be seen whether each of four different genome sequence groups would influence the genetic evolution of each other and become a dominant group, or continuously recombine and evolve in the population, resulting in the emergence of a novel viral isolate.To analyse the nt variation between chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolates and their parents, the sliding window method was used. The results showed that high nt variation was detected in five sites of the full-length genomes. Most nt variations occurred in the ORF1a/1b gene. One of the five sites was found in the S gene which encodes the S protein. The hydrophobicity and antigenicity variations of the S protein were then analysed. Hydrophobicity is associated with protein-protein interaction (e.g. ligand of virus-host receptor binding) and can be changed by replacement with hydrophobic amino acids(Bosch, Zee, Haan, & Rottier, 2003;Tekewe, Connors, Middelberg, & Lua, 2016), and change in antigenicity can affect immune response(Group et al., 2012;He, Li, Heck, Lustigman, & Jiang, 2006).",

To investigate the infectivity of the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV (P29_15_VN_1215) isolate compared to the Thai isolate (NT1_1215), both virus isolates were propagated in ST cells. The viral growth curves were developed and compared to each other. The results showed that the growth curve of chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) in ST cells was relatively lower compared to the Thai isolate at 12-60 hpi. This finding suggested that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) had less infectivity in ST cells than the Thai isolate. To demonstrated whether or not this chimeric Vietnam PDCoV (P29_15_VN_1215) isolate can induce clinical disease, the virus was orally inoculated in piglets. Clinical diseases were compared to piglets that were orally inoculated with the Thai isolate. The results demonstrated that both PDCoV isolates can induce clinical diseases and pathogenicity in piglets. V/C ratio of piglets infected with chimeric Vietnam PDCoV was reduced but not significant difference compared to those of piglets infected with Thai PDCoV.
