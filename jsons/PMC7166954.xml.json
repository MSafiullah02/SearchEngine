In children below the age of five, the combined global mortality of only influenza and RSV reaches 300 000 deaths each year.\n2\n Other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus and rhinovirus, are associated with lower mortality, but significant morbidity, causing a huge economic burden.\n3\n The highly pathogenic emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause epidemics or pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), have posed great threat to global public health. Most recently, a novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV (https://www.who.int) has caused the pneumonia in 41 confirmed cases of patients, including 7 in serious condition, 1 dead, and 2 recovered (https://www.shine.cn/news/nation/2001119576/). The full genomic sequence of this coronavirus was released on January 10, 2020 (http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319?from=groupmessage&isappinstalled=0), which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV and bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (SL\u2010CoV).\n4\n\n",

All viruses mentioned above can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as overlapping clinical presentations, making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without a solid laboratory analysis. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as viral culture and direct/indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), are time\u2010consuming and labor intensive with limited sensitivity. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies. Over the past decades, an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen, all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection.

It directly stains respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs with fluorescently labeled influenza virus\u2010specific antibodies.\n5\n Currently, several FDA\u2010approved enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent (ELISA)\u2010based tests are available for diagnosis of influenza virus infections. However, ELISA\u2010based tests often show lower sensitivity compared with nucleic acid\u2010based methods.

However, it has limited ability to further identify the subtypes of influenza viruses. In addition, its test performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity) varies widely. For example, in November 2009, 290 suspected influenza patients were analyzed using direct antigen EZ Flu A+B kit. The sensitivity and specificity of RIDT were 40.5% and 94.5%, respectively.\n45\n NAAT assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus\u2010specific genetic materials, rather than viral antigens or antibodies. Therefore, optimal extraction of viral genetic materials is required. One of the advantages of NAAT over RIDT is that NAAT is able to identify different subtypes of influenza viruses. Trombetta's group found that NAAT shows much higher sensitivity for both influenza A and influenza B viruses, despite its relative lower specificity.\n7\n A variety of NAAT assays, such as reverse transcriptase\u2010PCR, loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification\u2010based assay (LAMP), DNA\u2010microarray\u2010based and sequencing\u2010based tests, are appearing for diagnosis of influenza viral infections in humans.\n5\n Using the LAMP approach, Poon's group demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detection of seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from clinical specimens with analytical sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction.\n8\n Compared with the RT\u2010PCR\u2010based assay, a real\u2010time reverse transcription LAMP\u2010based assay (RT\u2010LAMP) showed a sensitivity of 97.8% and a specificity of 100% for detecting 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus.\n9\n LAMP\u2010based assays have also been used to detect the highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, having comparable, or higher, sensitivities than RT\u2010PCR\u2010based approaches.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n However, the high cost of NAAT, the complexity of the equipment required, and the need for trained professionals make NAAT assays less practical in areas with limited resources.",

This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.\n5\n For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.\n13\n The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.\n46\n\n",

For example, real\u2010time quantitative PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) is a rapid, specific, and sensitive TaqMan PCR method for detection, subgrouping, and quantitation of pathogens. This assay increases the sensitivity of conventional PCR. It needs two sets of primer\u2010probe pairs, which come from the nucleotide sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene or Fusion (F) gene targeting RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B, respectively.\n23\n, \n24\n A quantitative TaqMan PCR assay was once used to detect 175 nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children with respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong, and it detected 36 RSV\u2010positive samples, including 10 as RSV\u2010A and 26 as RSV\u2010B. In contrast, a cell culture\u2010based assay only identified 21, and an immunofluorescence assay identified 32 RSV\u2010positive specimens, all of which were among those identified by the TaqMan PCR assay, suggesting the greater accuracy and sensitivity of the TaqMan PCR assay.\n24\n In addition, locked nucleic acid (LNA)\u2010based one\u2010tube nested real\u2010time (OTNRT)\u2010PCR is an assay with very high sensitivity and low incidence of cross\u2010contamination for detection of RSV.\n25\n A total of 143 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples that tested RSV\u2010negative by qRT\u2010PCR were confirmed as RSV\u2010positive by sequencing the OTNRT\u2010PCR products,\n25\n indicating that OTNRT\u2010PCR is more sensitive than RT\u2010qPCR for detection of RSV in clinical samples. Moreover, the rapid reverse\u2010transcription recombinase\u2010aided amplification (RT\u2010RAA) assay was developed as a molecular\u2010based diagnostic method to detect subgroup RSV A and B genomes in clinical specimens. This method mainly utilizes an enzyme mixture, including single\u2010strand DNA binding protein (SSB), recombinase UvsX, and DNA polymerase, to detect RNA amplicons of RSV.\n26\n It is performed at 39\u00b0C in less than 30 minutes with high specificity. Furthermore, reverse transcription strand invasion\u2010based amplification (RT\u2010SIBA) is reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of RSV with good sensitivity since it can detect as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 minutes.\n27\n RT\u2010SIBA does not need highly purified RNA for detection of RSV, which can reduce the complexity of specimen preparation and shorten the total detection cycle in clinical specimens.",

The PowerChek MERS Real\u2010time PCR, Anyplex II MERS\u2010CoV (upE) Real\u2010time Detection and DiaPlexQ MERS Virus Detection kits consist of two steps. A single gene targets the upstream region of the upE region for screening, and multiple genes target both upE and ORF1a regions for final confirmation.\n30\n The AccuPower MERS\u2010CoV Real Time RT\u2010PCR, LightMix Molecular Dx MERS\u2010CoV upE/ORF1a, and UltraFast LabChip MERSCoV Real\u2010time PCR kits use two single gene\u2010targeting reagents to detect the upE and ORF1a genes simultaneously.\n30\n No cross\u2010reactivity has been reported with other respiratory viruses. Based on the validation tests, including 28 specificity panels and 9 clinical specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of all these rRT\u2010PCR kits for detecting upE and ORF1a reach 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60\u20101.00) and 100% (95% CI, 0.79\u20101.00), respectively. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, AccuPower and PowerChek have lowest sensitivity to the presence of PCR inhibition.\n29\n Therefore, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the above six rRT\u2010PCR kits are sufficient for diagnosing MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high\u2010throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the ~22 000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus. WGS enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub\u2010genomic sequences.",
