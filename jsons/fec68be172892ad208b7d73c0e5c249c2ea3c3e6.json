In each case, one or a small set of viral surface transmembrane glycoproteins mediates fusion. Viral fusion proteins vary in their mode of activation and in structural class. These features combine to yield many different fusion mechanisms. Despite their differences, common principles for how fusion proteins function are emerging: In response to an activating trigger, the metastable fusion protein converts to an extended, in some cases rodlike structure, which inserts into the target membrane via its fusion peptide. A subsequent conformational change causes the fusion protein to fold back upon itself, thereby bringing its fusion peptide and its transmembrane domain-and their attached target and viral membranes-into intimate contact. Fusion ensues as the initial lipid stalk progresses through local hemifusion, and then opening and enlargement of a fusion pore. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how fusion proteins are activated, how fusion proteins change conformation during fusion, and what is happening to the lipids during fusion. We also briefly discuss the therapeutic potential of fusion inhibitors in treating viral infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "1 Introduction", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Fusion of enveloped viruses with host cells remains an important topic of research for two major reasons.

Although several viral fusion proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein (Env), have emerged as paradigms, it is important to realize that there are many distinguishing features among viral fusion proteins (Table 1 ). Viral fusion proteins can be activated for fusion by different mechanisms. They have also been classified according to structural criteria. For some viruses, the viral receptor does not actively participate in fusion, whereas for others, one or more receptors are essential players. The location of the fusion peptide, critical for fusion, can vary. Finally, whereas some viruses require a single viral glycoprotein to mediate fusion, others require multiple viral glycoproteins. There are many excellent recent reviews on viral fusion and the glycoproteins that mediate this process (Durell et al. 1997; Eckert and Kim 2001; Heinz and Allison 2001; Skehel and Wiley 2000; Weissenhorn et al. 1999) .

After activation, the fusion peptides are rendered accessible for interaction with a target membrane. A major distinction among viral fusion proteins is the \"trigger\" for activation. There are two well-recognized mechanisms: (1) exposure to low pH and (2) specific interactions with target cell receptors at neutral pH.

These viruses are endocytosed after binding to the target cell surface. The low-pH environment of the endosome activates the viral fusion protein to convert from a metastable state to one that is capable of driving fusion. Although the presence of a receptor may modulate the rate or extent of fusion Stegmann et al. 1996; White et al. 1982) , receptors are not essential for low-pH-dependent fusion. Low-pH-dependent fusion generally occurs within seconds to minutes at 37C but can also occur, albeit more slowly, at T<22C. Four main techniques have been used to assess whether a virus requires low pH to fuse. The first technique is testing the effects of agents, such as bafilomycin, that inhibit endosomal acidification. In some studies of this type, fusion has been measured directly by assessing the transfer of fluorescent probes from the virus to the target cell (Earp et al. 2003; Irurzun et al. 1997; Zarkik et al. 1997) .

The role of low pH in this \"two-step\" model is derived from two key observations: (1) The continuous presence of endosomal acidification inhibitors prevents production of alpharetroviral reverse transcripts, and (2) cells expressing Env and cells expressing the viral receptor only form large syncytia after exposure to low pH (Mothes et al. 2000) .

The proteolytic processing event that generates the two subunits is critical, as it creates the metastable state of the fusion protein (Chen et al. 1998) . Class I fusion proteins exist as relatively long trimeric spikes in both their metastable and activated states. In their metastable states, they project perpendicularly to the viral membrane. The activated forms of the fusion subunits of known class I fusion proteins are highly a-helical , and the final lowestenergy (which we will refer to as \"postfusion\") forms ( Fig. 1) contain \"six-helix bundles\" (Bullough et al. 1994; Carr and Kim 1993) . All six-helix bundles contain a relatively long (65-115 ) central N-terminal trimeric coiled-coil.

Others display a mixture of helical and nonhelical segments that pack into the grooves of the central coiledcoil.

Env is activated for fusion (at neutral pH) after sequential binding to CD4 and a coreceptor (a chemokine receptor).

However, there is not yet a crystal structure of the native (metastable) Env trimer. Therefore, a detailed picture of HIV Env activation via receptor interaction is not available. We presume that the first steps of Env activation are separation of the globular head domains, expulsion of the fusion peptide, and extension of gp41 into a prehairpin intermediate (Fig. 3, Step 1). Several lines of evidence indicate the existence of the prehairpin intermediate. For example, peptide analogs of the C-terminal helix (Fig. 3 , green) strongly inhibit HIV fusion and infection (Chan and Kim 1998; Kilby et al. 1998 ). Also, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal helix coimmunoprecipitates with HIV Env after engagement of receptors (Furuta et al. 1998; He et al. 2003 ). The C-terminal helix then packs, in an antiparallel fashion, into the groove of the N-terminal coiled-coil ( Fig. 3, Step 5). Because the C-terminal helices of gp41 extend along the entire length of the N-terminal coiled-coil, this packing would bring the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain very close together.

It has been predicted that the internal fusion proteins of the class I fusion proteins from Ebola and avian retroviruses form disulfidebonded loop structures (Weisenhorn et al. 1998) , and mutagenesis work has supported this prediction Jeffers et al. 2002) . It remains to be seen, from high resolution structural studies, whether all internal fusion peptides, be they from class I, class II, or other classes of fusion proteins, interact with target bilayers as (disulfide bond) stabilized loops. Finally, we expect that there will be major developments in furthering the concept of targeting fusion as a weapon against pathogenic enveloped viruses. Particular emphasis will likely be on the development of small molecule inhibitors through the use of combinatorial chemistry in conjunction with high-throughput screens. It will be interesting to learn whether small molecule fusion inhibitors can be identified that block the entry of viruses that fuse in endosomes in response to low pH. This is a challenge for low-pH-activated class I fusion proteins such as influenza HA as well as for all known class II fusion proteins. Stay tuned.
