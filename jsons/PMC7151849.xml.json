In North American populations, the death rate is lower, but figures are not available. Well-managed farms should aim to lose fewer than 5% of their crias in a year. In general, crias suffer from the same maladies as other neonatal livestock. Dysmaturity, prematurity, dystocia, sepsis, and starvation are common problems and should be handled in the same way as in other species. In contrast, crias appear to have higher rates of certain problems such as those related to congenital malformations.",

Given how rapidly sick neonates can deteriorate, even these small abnormalities may indicate the need for aggressive action. Abnormalities are best detected through a thorough postnatal checkup, routine, consistent monitoring of progress according to the timetable in Chapter 25, generally observing activities, including nursing, elimination, and physical activity, and charting changes in size and body weight. Even small changes such as failure to gain weight over a 24-hour period while all else appears normal could be significant, and any delay in investigating these changes and initiating treatment could result in more advanced clinical disease. Interventions may be anything from modest management changes to intensive medical care. Identifying the neonates that require interventions and determining the level are matters of experience and good diagnostic evaluation.",

Breathing is the most urgent. Crias with overt dyspnea, including open-mouthed breathing or stertorous respiration, should be maintained in sternal recumbency or assisted to stand. The airway should be assessed for obstruction. The external nares should be cleared. A bulb syringe may be used to blow mucus back into the oropharynx, and a soft rubber urinary catheter may be inserted past the level of the eye in each nares for a quick assessment of choanal patency. Rubbing the thorax and dorsum also may stimulate breathing efforts. Breathing function may be assessed by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and thoracic radiography, and endoscopy or imaging studies may be used to assess airway patency (see Chapter 37). If hypoxemia is a concern, the cria may be placed on supplemental oxygen, and if ventilation is an issue, the cria may be intubated for mechanical ventilation. Face masks used for small animal patients may be tolerated in the short term but are hard to maintain. Nasal prongs used in human hospitals work well for crias and are self-retaining. Insufflation tubes or catheters placed in a nostril are also acceptable. When possible, supplemental oxygen should be warmed and humidified. Assessment of breathing function may be indicated even in the absence of dyspnea. Hypoxemia and hypercapnea are both important causes of neonatal obtundation, so supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation should be considered in any dull cria. Moribund crias are at risk of corneal ulcers because of reduced blinking reflexes. Ocular lubricants and common sense management to avoid eye trauma may be indicated.",

Signs of prematurity are as follows: overt external defects such as facial malformations, cleft palate, limb abnormalities, a bleeding umbilicus or umbilical hernia, patent urachus, malformations of the external genitalia (Figure 42-1\n), and absence or atresia of the anus. Mucous membranes and sclerae should be examined for cyanosis, injection, vascularity and refill times, and the anterior chamber of the eye should be examined for hypopyon. Normal vital parameters and issues with cardiac auscultation have been discussed earlier in this text. It is important to realize that sepsis leads to hypothermia more commonly than fever. Pulmonary auscultation is the same as in other species. Some degree of \u201csqueakiness\u201d is normal in the immediate postpartum period, but this should resolve within an hour. Neurologic examination is difficult to interpret in the immediate postpartum period or in severely obtunded crias but may be useful in older crias.",

Just as good oxygenation increases mental acuity and the desire to move, ambulation assists in chest excursions and clearance of prenatal fluid from the lungs. The three best points of contact are the sternum and the two points of the hips. Placing a towel under the abdomen may increase intraabdominal pressure and restrict breathing and may even promote body wall hernias. Encouraging a newborn to stand every 10 to 20 minutes may eventually lead to it standing on its own.",

If the dam has colostrum, the cria should preferably be assisted to nurse or the dam milked out so that the cria can be fed via a bottle or tube. Dams may be restrained against stall walls to allow recumbent crias to nurse (personal communication, Dr. D. Mora). Colostrum or milk may be given via a tube, pan, or bottle, and intravenous (IV) nutrition or plasma transfusion may be initiated. If the dam's colostrum is not available, camelid or ruminant colostrum may be administered for the first 12 to 24 hours. Ruminant colostrum should be from Johne's free herds or flocks, if possible. Bovine colostrum has also been associated with immune-mediated hemolysis in rare cases.",

Warmed goat or cow milk or milk replacer may be used, and an initial volume equal to approximately 3.5% of body weight appears adequate. If milk is administered in the absence of colostrum, plasma transfusion should be strongly considered. Although it has not yet been studied scientifically, some think that camelid milk has metabolic effects beyond simple nutrition, so any cria fed milk or milk replacer from another species should be observed carefully for changes in attitude or activity that could reflect the onset of a hyperglycemic disorder (see Chapter 41, \u201cHyperosmolar Disorder\u201d).

Overall, cross-matching for a one-time transfusion is rarely necessary, and reports of transfusion complications are rare. Plasma may be administered by intraperitoneal (IP) or IV injection. One unit (300 milliliters [mL]) is often sufficient for an alpaca, whereas a large llama cria with complete FPT may require 2 units to reach the desired range.",

Dysmaturity further describes crias born at a normal gestational age showing evidence of prematurity. These crias are as much at risk of morbidity as are premature crias.

Tendon laxity (see later in this chapter and in Chapter 58)may result in overextension of the carpal and fetlock joints, so crias may be seen walking on their fetlocks (Figure 42-3\n). Crias may also have a rubbery covering on the nails of the feet and a thicker epidermal membrane that persists for longer than normal. The central incisors normally erupt 2 to 3 weeks prior to birth, so unerupted incisors suggest that a cria is underdeveloped at least to this extent. Dymature crias tend to be weak and may have difficulty standing or holding their heads up to nurse because of poor muscle development. Furthermore, dysmature crias may have incomplete structural and functional maturation of vital body systems, and this leaves them susceptible to a range of potential neonatal complications. These crias are at risk for hypothermia because their thermoregulatory control is poor, and they are prone to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Respiratory system immaturity may result in poor lung expansion from lack of pulmonary surfactant, and this also reduces oxygen transfer across the alveoli. Poor oxygen diffusion together with bradypnea results in hypoxia. It is unknown when surfactant is produced in the lungs of camelids, but those with unerupted incisors are especially at risk. The intestinal mucosa may also be inadequately mature in premature crias, which results in inefficient absorption of colostral antibodies. More than half the dysmature crias presenting to one referral hospital had FPT.1\n",

Additionally, aminophylline (2 mg/kg, subcutaneously [SQ], q4h for 24 hours, followed by q6h for the next 24 hours and q8h for the next 24 hours) may be used proactively or therapeutically when concerns about breathing exist.

It is a dangerous misperception that the majority of sick neonates need supplemental glucose. Only 13% of sick crias in one unpublished study had hypoglycemia, including only 11% of crias less than 24 hours old, but 14% had blood glucose concentrations greater than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL; 11 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). It is, therefore, imperative to measure glucose before supplementing it. The most likely causes for hyperglycemia are stress and administration of glucose or a glycogenic agent, often compounded by insufficient water intake. Camelid milk may also play a role in suppressing hyperglycemia. The most likely causes for hypoglycemia are inadequate milk intake, potentially compounded by shivering or seizures, sepsis, or liver failure. If hypoglycemia is identified, it should be addressed promptly. The seizure threshold in crias appears to be just under 40 mg/dL (2.22 mmol/L) of glucose, so supplemental glucose is recommended for anything less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Rapid infusion of 0.5 mL/kg of 50% dextrose, or preferably a slow infusion of 3 to 5 mL/kg of 10% dextrose over 5 to 10 minutes may be used.",

Acidosis without dehydration has also been described.6 The pathogenesis of this is not completely understood. Crias occasionally get lactic acidosis from grain overload or fermentation of milk, but hyperlactemia is more commonly the result of septic or hypovolemic shock. Ketoacidosis is also seen. Treatment of acidosis depends partially on the pathogenesis. With lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis, the primary strategies are to decrease production and increase elimination of the organic acid. Both these may often be achieved by rehydration. Ketoacidosis may also require the same treatment as that for hepatic lipidosis, and intestinal fermentative conditions may need to be treated in the same way as grain overload. If the blood pH is below 7.25, bicarbonate administration may be necessary as well. Sodium bicarbonate administration is also the cornerstone of treatment of bicarbonate-losing conditions, particularly when blood pH is less than 7.25. Multiplying the base deficit (or 24 mEq/L minus the observed bicarbonate value) by 0.5 by body weight in kilograms yields the total bicarbonate deficit. Half of this may be given within the first hour of fluids and the second half over the next 2 to 4 hours. Bicarbonate administration often temporarily corrects acidosis, but repeated monitoring is necessary to determine whether further doses should be given. Bicarbonate should also be avoided with respiratory acidosis, as hypercapnea may worsen.",

In one recent study, 30 mL/kg of camelid plasma was administered to clinically healthy alpaca crias with FPT over 90 minutes.7 This resulted in measurable plasma volume expansion, which appeared to be safe, and also a considerable improvement in arterial oxygen pressure. However, treated crias also showed a reduction in lung volume, and it was suggested that this may result in complications for those crias having preexisting cardiopulmonary compromise. Therefore, greater care would be advised in administering large-volume plasma transfusions to any cria with suspicion of cardiopulmonary issues or systemic disease. Monitoring changes in central venous pressures during a transfusion may be helpful in preventing such complications.

At birth, neonates are subject to a rapid drop in external temperature and need to rapidly increase heat production to keep warm. For this, they are highly dependent on nonshivering thermogenesis (NST).8 This process takes place in the mitochondria of brown adipose tissue and results in an uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation such that heat energy is produced instead of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is dependent on adequate oxygenation, making hypoxemic neonates more susceptible to the development of hypothermia. Additionally, premature neonates are likely to have inadequate reserves of brown adipose tissue, which develop late in gestation under the influence of NST inhibitors. Shivering generates additional heat, but the impact of this is small in neonates because of their small size and immature musculature. The presence of brown adipose tissue has not been specifically documented in camelids to date, so the extent of the role of NST in averting hypothermia in crias is uncertain. Thyroid hormones may also play a role in enhancing thermogenesis in the newborn. Neonatal llama crias have been shown to have very high blood thyroxine concentrations at birth, which decrease gradually over the first 90 days of life.9\n",

It is particularly important to rule out or identify bacterial infection, since mortality rates may be high if this is not treated early and aggressively (see \u201cSepsis\u201d below). Neonates that are suffering from heat stress as a result of environmental conditions should be cooled. This may be achieved by removing the cria from the heat source, making use of fans, clipping of fleece, and using ice packs. Ice packs may be particularly effective if placed in the inguinal area close to the femoral arteries and veins; care should be taken, however, to wrap the ice packs in towels and not to place them directly onto the skin, as this may cause cold burns. NSAIDs are also indicated for neonates suffering from heat stress or seizures caused by hyperthermia. The use of NSAIDs for reducing fever from other causes is controversial because of the beneficial effects that fever may have, including stimulation of the immune response, as well as the potential harmful GI and renal effects of NSAIDs. They should therefore be used with care.",

Fetal llamas have been shown to have even more efficient tissue oxygen extraction.21 Llamas and alpacas have been shown to exhibit a much reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia such that they are resistant to the development of pulmonary hypertension at altitude.22 Furthermore, the fetal llama, in contrast to lowland species, has been shown to respond to acute hypoxia with intense peripheral vasoconstriction and only a modest increase in cerebral blood flow with reduced oxygen consumption, indicating hypometabolism, even in the brain.23 Presumably, the large decrease in peripheral oxygen consumption preserves available supplies for the brain. The fetal llama heart also receives an increase in blood flow in response to hypoxia.

Seizures always indicate abnormal brain activity.

Hydrocephalus may be the result of an intracranial or extracranial lesion. The most common causes of seizures are likely to be infections, cerebral edema, and metabolic disturbances.

            "text": "Crias with atresia ani or recti typically present within the first 3 days of life. Earliest detection is by handlers seeking to give an enema or determine the rectal temperature. Clinical signs may vary, but typically a history of tenesmus exists, and with delayed recognition, abdominal distension or pain on palpation of the abdomen may develop. Affected individuals presenting later may have weight loss, lethargy, and a poor appetite. The diagnosis is fairly evident upon examination of the perineal region because of the presence of a bulge or lack of the anal orifice. It may be difficult to determine the depth of the defect and whether it is amenable to surgical correction. Gentle pressure applied to the abdomen while observing the perineal area may allow a bulge to appear, but this is not particularly reliable as a prognostic indicator. Radiographic images demonstrate whether gas is present within the pelvis or extends into the perineal area. Ultrasonography of the perineum may demonstrate the distance from the skin to the blind end of the bowel. In the absence of other complicating defects, atresia ani is amenable to surgical management, but it is important to discuss the potential for heritability with the owner. That being said, if the caudal pouch of the rectum is not too deep, corrective surgery is not overly challenging, and most corrected animals may be healthy, albeit nonbreeding, members of the herd. Surgical correction is performed by making either a linear or preferably a circular incision over the presumed site of the anus, blunt dissection to identify the caudal extent of the rectal pouch, and then a rectal pull-through procedure (see Figure 40-64). The rectal serosa is sutured to the perineal skin by using a simple interrupted pattern. Sutures are placed at the lateral margins first, then dorsally and ventrally, and finally in between until 12 sutures have been made around the margin. It is preferable to perform this surgery with the cria fully anesthetized and intubated, as sometimes it may take time to locate the rectal pouch. Sedation with epidural anesthesia is a less desirable option. Perioperative antibiosis should be continued for 5 to 7 days, when the incision site has healed. The cria should be monitored for normal defecation, GI function, and behavior. Some crias outgrow the correction and may require a second surgery later, if they start straining again. The same surgery is performed for atresia recti, provided the portion of atretic rectum is not too long to achieve adequate mobilization.",

            "text": "Crias affected by atresia coli may not present initially with the suspicion of a GI tract anomaly, since the anus is usually present.39 Straining is less of a feature than with more caudal defects. The one reported case was in a 10-day-old cria that had been doing poorly since 2 days of age. Calves with atresia coli have been reported to survive as long as 19 days before diagnosis, and one recent study showed that the age of presentation of calves with atresia coli ranged from 3 to 18 days, whereas those with atresia ani presented at less than 4 days old.40, 48 Owners may report that they had not seen the cria pass feces and had seen straining, but occasionally some material may have been seen at the anus. This may be mucus and epithelial cells from the lining of the bowel mistaken for fecal material, particularly if the atretic portion of bowel is more proximal. Crias may initially be observed to do well for the first day or two of life and then start to do poorly, becoming dull and lethargic. Abdominal distension is progressive, and affected crias tend to exhibit a painful response on abdominal palpation. A gentle digital rectal examination may yield only mucus. Abdominal ultrasonography and radiographic studies (Figure 42-5\n) should show loops of distended intestine, consistent with intestinal obstruction. Hematologic and biochemistry findings are initially normal but become abnormal with progression of cardiovascular compromise and secondary complications. Differential diagnoses for the clinical findings described would be other forms of intestinal atresia, intestinal impaction or volvulus, intussusception, and diffuse peritonitis. Other potential differential diagnosis for neonatal crias with abdominal distension and pain, as well as constipation and lethargy, would be coccidiosis or clostridial enterotoxemia. Only 27% of crias with clostridiosis in one report had diarrhea, and it also appears to be an inconsistent finding with coccidiosis.49, 50 With clostridiosis, death usually followed within 1 to 2 days after the onset of clinical signs.",

The prognosis for calves undergoing corrective surgery is relatively poor, with discharge rates reported between 35% and 44%.51, 52, 53 Information about survival rates in crias is not available. Surgery is optimally performed under general anesthesia via a ventral midline or right flank incision. After identification of the atretic portion of bowel, an end-to-side colocolic anastomosis is recommended to minimize postoperative ileus and stenosis at the site of anastomosis.51, 53 Right midflank colostomy, a salvage procedure in calves, offers superior short-term survival but is not likely to be esthetically acceptable to camelid owners.48\n",

The cria should posture to defecate very shortly thereafter. Sometimes a second enema is required, but repeated enemas may promote tenesmus from mucosal irritation. Persistent impactions may be treated with retention enemas containing 4% acetylcysteine. This should be left in place for 15 to 45 minutes to allow better dissociation of meconium.

Affected crias often exhibit ill-thrift, reduced appetite, lethargy, left-sided abdominal distension, and diarrhea. Splashing sounds may be detected on auscultation of C1. Ultrasonography clearly shows fluid swirling around in C1 where none should exist. Aspiration through a stomach tube passed into C1 may yield fermented milk; a small diameter tube should be used, such as a stallion urinary catheter with a 60-mL catheter-tipped syringe. Usually, affected crias either are overfed (more than 15% of their body weight in a 24-hour period) or drink large volumes of milk rapidly from the bottle. Feeding smaller volumes at a higher frequency and using a bottle with a small nipple orifice may help prevent this. This technique may also be employed to treat affected crias. Ideally, C1 should be emptied, but this may be difficult with a stomach tube and carries a risk of aspiration. Reduced milk feeding may also help in the short term, but it is important to continue to provide hydration and meet the energy demands with IV fluids and parenteral nutrition. In refractory crias over 2 weeks of age, it may be advisable to transfaunate them and encourage them to eat forage to prevent overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria.",

Hypoproteinemia may be present as a result of FPT and hypogammaglobulinemia or because of leakage of protein into the abdomen. Ultrasonography may show an increase in the volume of peritoneal fluid and may suggest a possible source for the peritonitis. Occasionally, the quality of the ultrasonographic image appears to be suboptimal and might appear granular, an appearance that may be replicated on radiography. Definitive diagnosis is obtained by analysis and culture of the peritoneal fluid. Cytologic abnormalities include increases in nucleated cell counts, particularly by cells of the neutrophil line; the appearance of immature neutrophils or cells with toxic changes, possibly the appearance of intracellular or extracellular microorganisms; and also possibly the appearance of feed material. Peritoneal fluid protein concentrations are also usually high. In healthy adult alpacas and llamas, peritoneal fluid was found to contain up to 3000 total nucleated cells per microliter (cells/\u00b5L), with fewer than 2000 neutrophils/\u00b5L and protein concentration less than 2.5 g/dL.59 Normal values have not been established for camelid neonates, but in healthy foals, the total nucleated cell counts are considerably lower than those seen in adults.60\n",

Both unilateral and bilateral renal agenesis have been reported.73, 74 Bilaterally affected crias have progressive obtundation without evidence of urine production. Azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia may be detected on blood analysis and are refractory to fluid treatment. Ultrasonography should permit identification of neonatal kidneys with ease, so an inability to find either or both kidneys raises suspicion. Contrast radiography or cross-sectional imaging techniques may be useful as well. Crias with one relatively normal kidney may escape detection, unless that kidney has a progressive condition or is otherwise damaged. One reported cria was presented at 4 days of age for inappetence and was treated for failure of passive transfer and sepsis but was brought back within a month with azotemia. Agenesis of the right kidney was suspected, and acute renal failure was diagnosed.73 The diagnosis was confirmed at necropsy. No nephrotoxic drugs had been administered, but it is possible that the initial septicemic episode resulted in damage to the normal kidney. Another llama cria was suspected to have unilateral renal agenesis and unilateral renal hypoplasia. In this case, only a nodule of hyperechoic soft tissue was found at the expected site of one kidney, and the other was very small and did not appear to have normal kidney structure on ultrasonography. Azotemia was identified on biochemistry, and the cria was treated symptomatically as a neonate, but the azotemia persisted even when the cria appeared clinically well. This llama lived for about 2 years before being euthanized as a result of renal failure (J. Lakritz, personal communication). Even when it appears normal, the kidney contralateral to the hypoplastic one may harbor a degenerative process, so affected crias should be monitored closely.",

In other cases, crias present with stranguria. If the vulva is totally imperforate, it protrudes as a fluid-filled swelling (see Figure 42-5); in some cases, a small hole may be present and allow urine to pass under pressure. Corrective vulvoplasty is a quick and simple procedure. Sedation or general anesthesia is not required. The cria is restrained in sternal recumbency and positioned with the hindlimbs over the end of a table; The region may be numbed by injection of a local anesthetic or topical use of an anesthetic gel, or regional anesthesia may be achieved through a sacrococcygeal epidural injection (approximately 0.1 mL of lidocaine is adequate). The site is prepared aseptically, and a dorsal to ventral incision is made on the midline of the vulva to create an approximately normal-sized vulvar opening (Figure 42-8\n). Making the incision in this direction minimizes the chances of unintentionally creating a rectovaginal fistula. The vestibular mucosa may be sutured to the vulvar skin using an absorbable suture material, but suturing is not required and is not normally done. Postoperatively, the site should be treated with a topical antibiotic ointment with steroid once or twice daily for 5 to 7 days to prevent the wound from closing over again.",

Healthy neonates typically have low creatinine concentrations because of low muscle mass, but concentrations may be higher in the first 48 hours of life because of possible placental dysfunction, volume depletion, ingestion of creatinine-rich fetal fluids, or reduced renal clearance in premature crias.79 Dehydration as a result of failure to ingest fluids or fluid losses from diarrhea are the most likely causes of prerenal azotemia, whereas sepsis, nephrotoxins, a congenital malformation, or poor perfusion may result in organ dysfunction. Diseases primarily affecting other organ systems often result in renal compromise, so it is important to identify underlying disease processes and treat them and azotemia appropriately. Toxic causes of renal failure in neonates include nephrotoxic drugs such as gentamicin and oxytetracycline or oversupplementation of vitamin D to prevent rickets.80 Vitamin D toxicity was reported in two neonatal alpacas with anuric acute renal failure. Both had received toxic amounts of vitamin D orally over multiple consecutive days and developed soft tissue mineralization with hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia. These doses were estimated to be 3750 international units per kilogram per day (IU/kg/day) for 7 days and 12,987 IU/kg/day for 5 days. Mineralization was evident as a continuous hyperechoic line on ultrasonography of the kidneys and as a grossly visible white line on the cut-section of the renal medulla at necropsy.",

Blood samples should be analyzed from any sick neonate to aid in prompt recognition of biochemical abnormalities so that appropriate treatment can be given and fluid therapy adjusted according to requirements. Ideally, a urine sample should be evaluated for specific gravity in order to differentiate renal from prerenal azotemia. Urinalysis (dipstick, quantitative tests, and cytology) is also helpful in diagnosing renal failure. High protein on a dipstick test should be evaluated quantitatively and in the light of other findings on urinalysis. Increased protein with bacteria, increased white blood cells, hemorrhage, or all of these may occur with infections of the urinary tract, whereas increased protein without these suggests loss of protein at the glomerulus. Finding casts on cytologic evaluation suggests tubular damage. Assessment of urine output and fractional excretion (FE) of sodium may also aid in determining renal function. Fractional excretions are best calculated before the administration of fluids. Low FE of sodium is most often the case in prerenal azotemia because of angiotensin-mediated sodium resorption, whereas in true renal disease, FE of sodium is usually markedly increased. Fractional excretion of sodium is calculated by using the following formula:FENa=Urine [Na]\u00f7Plasma [Na]\u00d7100\nUrine [Cr]\u00f7Plasma [Cr]\n",

Large, hypoechoic or anechoic, well-circumscribed circular lesions may be cystic or neoplastic, even in quite young crias. Early identification of cystic or hypoplastic kidneys allows decisions to be made before too many hospital expenses have accrued. The ureters are easier to find if they are dilated; otherwise they are usually only seen as they exit the kidney. Plain or contrast radiography is likewise helpful (see Figures 39-7 and 39-7).

Sick neonatal camelids are often hypoproteinemic, so extra care must be taken when administering fluids to avoid potential complications such as pulmonary edema. Administration of colloids, especially plasma, helps prevent this and also addresses any underlying failure of passive transfer. With shock, initial crystalloid resuscitation may be achieved by using fluid boluses of up to 100 mL/kg over 15 to 30 minutes, but boluses greater than 20 mL/kg are rarely necessary, especially when followed by fluids at 2 to 4 mL/kg/hr.79 Low sodium fluids are recommended in neonates with hypernatremia. Fluids may be administered continuously either as boluses every few hours or by continuous infusion, depending on what facilities are available. If a pump is not available, care must be taken not to underestimate the flow rate, particularly with positional catheters. Bolus administration is safer in this regard and allows the cria to stay with the dam. Allowing the cria to continue to nurse, if able, lowers stress and provides nutrition and water. Furosemide may be used to promote diuresis in cases with oliguria, preferably by constant rate infusion (0.66 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.66 mg/kg/hr). However, its effects rely on furosemide reaching the lumen of the renal tubules, and this may be minimal in renal failure.",

If the pad of the foot continues to bear weight and the leg does not buckle with movement, contracture, like laxity, usually resolves as the animal walks around on it. If a cria has trouble standing or tries to walk on the dorsal aspect of the fetlock, manual stretching several times daily may resolve the problem. If physiotherapy alone is not successful, splinting the limb in as extended a position as possible may be required for up to 2 weeks. Padded gutter splints designed for dogs work well in crias, as do partial rounds of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping over cotton padding. Many affected crias are able to bear weight within a few days of splint application. The prognosis is worse for flexural deformities of carpus than for lower limb joints. If physical measures fail, radiography should be performed to ensure that the anatomy is normal before any more invasive and costly measures are undertaken. If arthrogryposis is suspected, diagnostic evaluation of the brain and spinal cord may be indicated as well. Suspensory ligament desmotomy was successful in one cria with bilateral flexural deformity of the carpal and fetlock joints.82 Two earlier cases were less successful. One described bilateral transection of both superficial and deep flexor tendons, as well as the suspensory ligament in a 1-day-old llama that presented with severe flexural deformities of both metacarpophalangeal joints.83 This resulted in ischemic necrosis of one distal limb at the level of the fetlock. In a second case report, wedge osteotomy of metacarpal bones III and IV was performed, but this resulted in luxation of the fetlock joint.84 Another cria presented at 2 months of age with severe bilateral flexural deformities of the carpi (Figure 42-9\n). This cria was treated surgically by transection of the ulnaris lateralis and flexor carpi ulnaris tendons, followed by postoperative splint application. The cria made a good recovery. These cases suggest that careful evaluation of the deformity with manipulation of the limbs prior to surgery guide the surgeon as to the most appropriate structures to transect.",

These become distorted by the pressure of weight-bearing.89 Changes are most obvious in sites where growth occurs rapidly, as in growth plates adjacent to the carpal and fetlock joints and the costochondral junctions of the ribs. Vertebral growth plates may be affected as well, possibly leading to secondary nerve impingement. Mineralization defects, including increased physeal and articular cartilage depth, irregular appearance of growth plates, metaphyseal flaring, and thinned cortices, may be seen readily on radiography (Figure 42-11\n). Changes may be identified clinically as swollen, painful joints, pathologic fractures, and the classical \u201crosary bead\u201d feel along the ribcage (Figure 42-12\n), which reflects enlargement of the costochondral junctions. Angular limb deformities may subsequently develop, and affected individuals show lethargy, have depressed appetites, may be lame and walk with a hunched back because of pain, and are typically smaller than age-matched animals; herd mates may not be good comparators because they may also be affected.

A small amount of vitamin D is also passed to offspring transplacentally and via the dam's milk.90 Vitamin D2 is found in higher concentrations in mature grass or hay; spring grass has relatively little. Therefore, spring is a high-risk time for recently weaned summer-born or fall-born crias put on fresh pastures without supplementary feeding. Vitamin D3 production is also seasonal; blood concentrations drop during the winter months because of reduced UV light availability.90, 91, 92 Heavy cloud cover reduces UV penetration to Earth's surface. It is believed that reduced exposure to UV radiation at low altitudes and nonequatorial latitudes (i.e., outside of South America) reduces vitamin D activation in skin. It has also been suggested that dark pigmentation and thicker fleece in sheep reduce photobiosynthesis of vitamin D and that darker unsheared animals are therefore more susceptible to rickets.92 Similar findings were found in alpacas in two separate reports.86, 91\n",

This may be confirmed by preadministration determination of serum vitamin D concentration. Carpal valgus is the ALD most amenable to surgical management. For crias affected by rickets, corrective surgery to address this deformity, combined with vitamin D supplementation, is likely to improve corresponding deformities at other sites such as at the fetlocks, since the angulation of these joints is also improved. The least invasive technique and one that is appropriate at an advanced stage is periosteal stripping. This may be combined with partial ulna ostectomy. The cria is placed under general anesthesia and positioned in dorsal recumbency. A 5-cm incision is made on the lateral aspect of the carpus, starting immediately proximal to the distal physis of the ulna and continued proximally. The incision is made right down to the bone, and the periosteum is elevated from the radius and ulna as far as can be reached in a cranial and caudal direction. Care must be taken to avoid damaging nearby ligaments. A small section of the distal ulna may be removed using bone rongeurs. The skin incision is then closed and light pressure dressings placed postoperatively for 7 to 10 days to reduce swelling. Reevaluation should be done 30 to 45 days following surgery to assess the adequacy of correction.",

At this point, transphyseal bridging of the radial growth plates may be done. This technique is effective in young animals that still have open growth plates and are still growing. In this case, the incision is made on the medial aspect of the carpus. The position of the radial growth plate is estimated using radiography as a guide, and 18-gauge needles are placed into the bone above and below the growth plate. These mark the intended locations for screw placement. Intraoperative craniocaudal radiography allows the surgeon to place screws correctly using the needles as guides. One cortical bone screw (2.7-mm or 3.5-mm diameter) is placed proximal and one distal to the medial aspect of the distal radial physis. Before tightening down the screws, an 18- to 20-gauge orthopedic wire is placed around them in a figure-of-8 pattern. A light pressure bandage is again placed postoperatively for 7 to 10 days. The owner needs to monitor the cria closely so that the bridge can be removed just when the deformity has been corrected. This normally occurs in 3 to 4 weeks. It is possible that one leg may be corrected more quickly than the other in bilateral cases, leading to two separate surgeries for screw removal.
