In 2001, 198,000 patients younger than 15 years were discharged from hospitals in the United States with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia [1]. In North America, the annual incidence of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years is 30 to 45 cases per 1000; in children aged 5 years and older, the annual incidence is 16 to 22 cases per 1000 [2], [3]. In developing countries, which account for more than 95% of episodes of clinical pneumonia worldwide, researchers estimate that more than 150 million new cases occur annually in children younger than 5 years [4].",

Ventilator-associated pneumonia differs in several respects from CAP and is addressed separately in this article. Although no precise definition is universally applied, CAP is generally defined as an infection of the lungs that is marked by symptoms of acute infection (ie, fever, cough, or dyspnea) and is typically associated with abnormal auscultatory findings (eg, rales or altered breath sounds) or the presence of an acute infiltrate on chest imaging in an individual not hospitalized or residing in a long-term care facility for at least 14 days before onset of symptoms [5].",

In a recent US study of children aged 2 months to 17 years who were hospitalized for pneumonia, 45% were found to have a viral etiology [7]. In general, the most frequently isolated respiratory viruses are respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza A and B, and adenovirus, although other viruses may occur in specific settings (eg, cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex infection in neonates). Most cases of viral pneumonia can be managed without invasive diagnostic testing, and aside from supportive care, no specific antimicrobial therapy is generally required. For these reasons, the remainder of this article focuses on bacterial pneumonia, although important distinctions related to viral etiologies are highlighted when appropriate.",

            "text": "The epidemiology of bacterial CAP differs by age and has been impacted by vaccine strategies. From birth to 3 weeks of age, the most common causes of pneumonia are Group B streptococci and gram-negative rods (particularly enterics such as Escherichia coli). Although viruses predominate from 3 weeks to 3 months of age, bacterial pneumonia can occur in this age group. Afebrile pneumonia at this age is frequently caused by Chlamydia trachomatis; this agent rarely requires hospital admission unless found in combination with another respiratory tract pathogen, such as respiratory syncytial virus or pertussis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of febrile pneumonia among children aged 3 weeks to 4 years. A recent study from Texas found that 60% of children between 2 months and 17 years of age who were admitted with pneumonia had a bacterial pathogen isolated, and S. pneumoniae was confirmed in 73% of those cases [7]. Other less commonly isolated bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae (historically type b before widespread vaccine use, but currently includes nontypable H. influenzae), Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and other streptococcal species (including the Streptococcus milleri group). In children aged 5 years and older, the most common bacterial pathogens are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (previously known as Chlamydia pneumoniae). These atypical agents account for nearly one fourth of all cases of bacterial pneumonia among school-aged children and adolescents [7]. Pneumococcus remains high on the list of agents identified among children who are hospitalized for pneumonia. In addition to these common causes of pneumonia, various other micro-organisms can cause pneumonia in particular circumstances. Table 2\nprovides a list of these less frequent pathogens and the risk factors or clinical situations that should prompt consideration of more unusual infections. Finally, it is important to remember that a significant proportion of cases of pediatric pneumonia represents a mixed infection [8].",

            "text": "Pathogen, host, and environmental factors all play a role in the development of pneumonia, which typically begins with tracheal colonization by the infecting micro-organism [9]. The initial line of defense against the establishment of a respiratory pathogen is the barrier defenses of the airway, namely the mucosal barrier of respiratory epithelium and the mucociliary apparatus that is responsible for clearing foreign material and micro-organisms from the airway [10]. Once the lower respiratory tract is inoculated with a sufficient burden of bacteria, the normal inflammatory response that fights infection (which includes components such as antibodies, complement, phagocytes, and cytokines) also results in damage to functioning lung tissue [11]. The bacteria that commonly cause pneumonia also possess specific virulence factors that enhance their survival and propagation while concurrently resulting in injury to the pulmonary host. For example, S. pneumoniae contains pneumolysin, a pore-forming protein that enables the bacterium to kill host cells, which results in complement activation and a vigorous inflammatory response [12]. Pneumonia also may result from direct seeding of the lung tissue after bacteremia, which may be a particularly important mechanism for bacteria such as pneumococcus and S. aureus.",

Tachypnea widely has been shown to be the most sensitive indicator [13], [14], [15], [16]. The World Health Organization defines tachypnea as a respiratory rate (RR) of more than 60 breaths/min in infants younger than 2 months of age, RR of more than 50 breaths/min from ages 2 to 12 months, and RR of more than 40 breaths/min in children older than 12 months [17]. Several studies have found that cutoffs of more than 50 breaths/min in children younger than 12 months and more than 40 breaths/min in children aged 12 to 35 months provide the greatest combination of sensitivity and specificity in identifying children with lower respiratory infections [18], [19], [20], although one study showed that a single value of 50 breaths/min for all ages was equally useful [21]. The precise predictive value depends on the underlying prevalence of disease [22], but a diagnosis of pneumonia in the industrialized world rarely would be made based solely on the presence of tachypnea (which is present in many other childhood illnesses, including bronchiolitis and asthma).",

Pneumonia also has been shown to be the most common diagnosis in children with white blood cell counts of 25,000/mm3 or more and even in children with white blood cell counts of 35,000/mm3 or more [28]. Other inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are generally elevated. One study found that patients with an elevated C-reactive protein were more likely to have pneumonia of proven or probable bacterial cause as opposed to viral or Mycoplasma pneumonia [29].",

This recommendation stems from previous work, which suggested that the rate of bacteremia in adults hospitalized for pneumonia was in the range of 10% to 30%. Several more recent studies have attempted to evaluate the use of blood cultures in the diagnosis of pneumonia, however. In these studies, the yield of blood cultures has been lower\u2014generally ranging from 3% to 11%\u2014and the management of pneumonia is rarely altered [33], [34], [35]. Various organisms may be detected, but S. pneumoniae has been the most frequently isolated pathogen in these studies. It is likely that the current rate of bacteremia will be lower because of the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the routine childhood immunization schedule. With increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and limited available data regarding the use of cultures of the blood among children with pneumonia since the widespread use of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, we feel that patients with disease severe enough to require hospital admission and parenteral antimicrobial therapy generally should have cultures of blood sent before therapy. Although it is uncommon to identify a pathogen, the identification of a specific organism (such as S. pneumoniae or S. aureus) and its associated antimicrobial susceptibilities can be helpful (especially in more severe cases or when pleural effusions are present).",

Culture of the sputum has had variable use in published studies, with yields ranging from 5% to 34% [34], [36]. To be considered reliable (ie, bronchial in origin as opposed to oropharyngeal), a sputum sample should contain fewer than ten epithelial cells per low-powered field [37]. It is difficult to obtain a good sputum sample from children, who often have a nonproductive cough. In general, a valuable sample of expectorated sputum is difficult to obtain from a preschool-aged child. Although a sputum Gram stain with a single predominant organism, leukocytes, and few epithelial cells can be helpful, a negative Gram stain result never should exclude pneumonia as a possible diagnosis. Pneumococcal urinary antigen testing is generally not recommended as a diagnostic modality in pediatric pneumonia; despite good sensitivity, the specificity of this test is low (because it is frequently positive in individuals with nasopharyngeal colonization, particularly young children) [38], [39]. Viral diagnostics (either culture or antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibodies) are not necessary in most routine pneumonia cases, but they can be useful in certain circumstances (including cases that involve immunocompromised patients or to help guide infection control precautions). Mycoplasma infection can be identified using serology (a positive IgM is an indicator of acute infection); polymerase chain reaction testing is also available and has higher sensitivity and specificity [40], but it is rarely necessary outside of the research setting. C. pneumoniae may be detected rapidly by direct fluorescent antibodies from a nasopharyngeal specimen or diagnosed by serology. Legionella urinary antigen is the diagnostic modality of choice when Legionella pneumophila infection is suspected, and the test can remain positive for weeks after acute infection. It is important to remember that the urinary antigen is negative in cases that involve other species of Legionella. The decision to perform a skin test with purified protein derivative in patients who present with pneumonia should be based on the presence of risk factors that would increase the likelihood of tuberculosis or when specific radiographic findings suggest mycobacterial disease (such as the presence of mediastinal adenopathy).",

The presence of respiratory signs (eg, cough, tachypnea, and rales) increases the likelihood of a positive chest radiograph, and one meta-analysis suggested that infants younger than 3 months of age with a temperature of 100.5\u00b0 F or higher but with no clinical findings of pulmonary disease (defined as rales, ronchi, retractions, wheezes, tachypnea, coryza, grunting, stridor, nasal flaring, or cough) do not require routine chest radiography, because the probability of a normal chest radiograph in the absence of these findings is at least 98.98% [41], [42]. When chest radiographs are obtained in patients who have pneumonia, various patterns may be seen. Alveolar infiltrates are seen more frequently in bacterial pneumonia, whereas viral infection is more frequently associated with an interstitial pattern [43]. These distinctions are not universal, however, and studies have confirmed that patients with viral pneumonia can present with infiltrates that have a lobar or alveolar appearance [44]. Interobserver agreement among radiologists about the pattern of infiltrates (alveolar versus interstitial) or the presence of air bronchograms also has been demonstrated to be poor [45]. One interesting study showed that radiologists' readings of chest radiographs in febrile children aged 3 to 24 months were biased by the reading of the treating physician (when compared with radiologists who did not have access to that information) [46]. Mycoplasma pneumonia appears most commonly as unilateral or bilateral areas of airspace consolidation and can include reticular or nodular opacities. On high-resolution CT, ground-glass opacities, airspace consolidation, nodules, and bronchovascular thickening are common [47]. When children exhibit persistent or progressive symptoms despite seemingly adequate therapy, contrast-enhanced chest CT can be useful in detecting suppurative complications, such as empyema or necrosis, that may require further intervention [48].",

From age 3 weeks to 3 months, if the infant is afebrile, erythromycin (40 mg/kg/d IV divided every 6 hours) is the drug of choice for treatment of C. trachomatis. If fever is present or if a child seems ill, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/d every 24 hours) should be given. For patients aged 4 months to 4 years, when viral pneumonia (the most common cause) is suspected, no antibiotic therapy should be administered. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, IV ampicillin (200 mg/kg/d divided every 6 hours) can be used. If the child appears ill, ceftriaxone may be chosen instead to provide broader coverage. Finally, among children aged 5 years or older, azithromycin (one dose of 10 mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg/d) or erythromycin can be used in routine cases to provide coverage of atypical organisms (particularly Mycoplasma); ampicillin may be added if there is strong evidence of a bacterial etiology, and ceftriaxone (with or without a macrolide) may be used in children who are more ill. In all ages, if features that suggest S. aureus are present, oxacillin or vancomycin should be added, depending on the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus in the community [6].",

For Chlamydia and Mycoplasma infections, a macrolide (at the doses described previously) is the drug of choice. In patients with suspected pneumococcal pneumonia, therapeutic choices are driven by local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. When S. pneumoniae has been recovered from an appropriate patient specimen, the antibiotic susceptibility pattern can be used to guide therapy. For isolates that are fully susceptible to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration <0.1 \u03bcg/mL), ampicillin should be administered (because of its easier dosing schedule as compared with penicillin). Even for isolates with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration 0.1\u20131 \u03bcg/mL), high-dose ampicillin (200 mg/kg/d) provides excellent coverage. When fully nonsusceptible isolates are encountered (minimal inhibitory concentration \u22652 \u03bcg/mL), ceftriaxone should be used. Unlike the treatment of meningitis, vancomycin is rarely necessary in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, even when a penicillin nonsusceptible strain is the etiologic agent. It should be added only if ceftriaxone resistance (defined for pneumonia as a minimal inhibitory concentration of \u22654 \u03bcg/mL) is demonstrated. A recent study from Spain suggested that the combination of a beta-lactam plus a macrolide may be superior to a beta-lactam alone for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, but no randomized trial addressing this hypothesis has been published to date [51]. When H. influenzae is considered a likely pathogen (such as in children with underlying lung disease), ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam is preferred rather than ampicillin because of the presence of beta-lactamase\u2013mediated ampicillin resistance among many H. influenzae isolates.",

For pneumococcal pneumonia, treatment probably should continue until the patient has been afebrile for 72 hours, and the total duration of therapy probably should not be less than 10 to 14 days (or 5 days if using azithromycin because of its long tissue half-life). Fevers may persist for several days after initiation of appropriate therapy, which reflects the resultant inflammatory cascade and tissue damage. No good data are available to support prolonged treatment courses for patients without underlying conditions (eg, cystic fibrosis) who have uncomplicated pneumonia.

The differences in recommended management strategies contribute to variation in care for this diagnosis, however [55]. Published studies of adult patients with CAP have shown that adherence to a treatment guideline results in improvement in several outcomes, including lower costs, decreased length of stay, more appropriate antibiotic usage, and lower mortality rates [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61].

Whereas S. pneumoniae accounts for most cases with parapneumonic effusions, S. aureus and S. pyogenes are associated with particularly high rates of effusion and empyema [73]. Tuberculosis is also a common cause in geographic areas with a high prevalence of disease and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of selected patients [74]. Traditionally, the classification of such effusions as transudative versus empyema has been based on laboratory analysis of the pleural fluid. Characteristics that suggest empyema include pH less than 7.1, lactate dehydrogenase more than 1000 IU/mL, and glucose less than 40 mg/dL [75]. Additional data that may be obtained include an elevated pleural fluid white blood cell count (ie, >50,000/mm3) or a positive microbiologic study (including Gram stain, culture, or other diagnostic tests, such as stains or polymerase chain reaction). Pleural fluid cell count has limited predictive value, however [76], and a positive microbiologic diagnosis is made from pleural fluid analysis in less than one third of cases [77]. CT scan findings (such as pleural thickening or enhancement, among others) have been shown to be inaccurate in predicting which effusions meet laboratory criteria for empyema [78].",

Drainage of the fluid by thoracentesis or placement of a drainage tube (large-bore chest tube or pigtail catheter) can remove the effusion. One study found that either needle aspiration alone or catheter drainage resulted in similar complication rates and lengths of stay, but children who underwent primary aspiration without catheter placement had a higher reintervention rate than children who had catheter placement at the time of initial drainage [79]. Lower pH (especially <7.2) and presence of loculations also were independent predictors of reintervention in this study. The natural history of parapneumonic effusions follows several stages, beginning with an exudative phase, during which the fluid is free-flowing and of low cellularity. This stage is followed 24 to 48 hours later by a fibropurulent phase, during which the accumulation of fibrin and neutrophils may result in loculation. Finally, an organizing phase occurs, with fibroblast activity resulting in the formation of a \u201cpeel.\u201d Thoracoscopy with surgical d\u00e9bridement may be necessary when the effusion has been longstanding enough to have allowed the development of septations, which reduce the feasibility of tube drainage. Surgery has been shown to reduce the length of stay for hospitalized children whose effusions were considered high grade (defined as containing sonographic evidence of organization such as fronds, septation, or loculation) [80]. In particular, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has been shown to have numerous advantages compared with open thoracotomy, including fewer lung resections, fewer associated blood transfusions, less postoperative analgesia, shorter length of stay, faster resolution of fever, and shorter time to removal of chest drains [81].",

These agents are used when inadequate drainage is obtained after chest tube insertion. Recent reports of fibrinolytic therapy in children demonstrate that 60% to 70% of effusions in the fibropurulent phase can be drained completely and another 20% to 30% can be drained partially using the technique of daily instillation of streptokinase or urokinase through a chest tube with a dwell time of 4 hours. This technique is ineffective in draining effusions that already have reached the organizing phase, however [82], [83]. Increased drainage also has been demonstrated using a 1-hour dwell of tissue plasminogen activator [84]. One randomized trial in children showed that children who received intrapleural urokinase treatment had a shorter length of stay compared with a placebo group [85]. Fibrinolytic therapy has been associated with several rare complications, including allergic reactions (particularly with streptokinase), hemorrhage, and bronchopleural fistula formation. A large, prospective, randomized trial is needed to define better several aspects of this treatment option, including precise indications, optimal dosing and duration of therapy, and complication rates.",

Evaluation of a child with recurrent pneumonia should include a detailed history that focuses on possible indicators of these underlying illnesses combined with a targeted diagnostic evaluation that may include tests such as swallowing studies, serum immunoglobulins, HIV testing, echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, sweat testing, or radiographic studies, such as chest CT.",

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is best identified using a combination of diagnostic modalities. In one study, 90% of ventilated children with bacterial pneumonia met one of the following three criteria: (1) bronchoscopic protected specimen brush culture with 103 or more colony-forming units/mL, (2) intracellular bacteria in 1% or more of cells retrieved by BAL, (3) BAL fluid culture with 104 or more colony-forming units/mL [93].",

Some of the more common scenarios seen in hospitalized patients include malignancy (either hematologic or solid tumors), solid organ or stem cell transplant, congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, and autoimmune disorders or immunosuppressive medications used to treat systemic illnesses. Regardless of cause, the immunocompromised host should be considered high risk for infection and merits a more aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Table 4\nreviews micro-organisms that may be pathogens in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia. In particular, viral infections (especially cytomegalovirus) and fungal infections (including Candida and Aspergillus) must be considered [95] along with unusual organisms such as Pneumocystis jaroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) or Cryptococcus neoformans. Results of chest radiographs in patients with neutropenia may be negative [96], although findings that suggest an infectious cause (such as nodules) may be visible on plain films [97]. Chest CT scan may demonstrate abnormalities that are not detected on routine radiograph and may help localize lesions (particularly nodules) that are amenable to biopsy to aid in diagnosis [98]. MR imaging is another alternative diagnostic modality and may be more sensitive for the detection of necrotizing pneumonia than CT scan [99]. Flexible bronchoscopy can establish a diagnosis in many cases, and several sampling methods are available. In one study of immunocompromised patients, the diagnostic yield was highest using a combination of BAL and transbronchial biopsy (70%), as compared with BAL alone (38%), transbronchial biopsy alone (38%), or protected specimen brush sampling (13%) [100]. Finally, lung biopsy may be considered to assist in making a diagnosis in patients with a concerning clinical status in whom noninvasive testing has failed to uncover an etiologic agent [101]. In general, decisions regarding diagnostic testing may need to be accelerated in this population of patients to permit any interventions to be performed before clinical status deteriorates and a patient is unable to tolerate invasive procedures and to allow appropriate therapy to be initiated earlier in the course of disease.",

Table 5\nreviews the correct precautions for specific organisms that may be encountered in the hospital setting. Two infections that merit specific mention are pertussis and influenza. These organisms are highly infectious, and exposure among hospital staff may require chemoprophylaxis. Patients with pertussis or influenza should be admitted to a single room whenever possible. Staff also should wear masks when entering the room of patients with influenza (despite the fact that droplet transmission precautions usually only require masks within 3 feet), because several reports have suggested a role for airborne transmission [102], [103], [104]. When pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected, strict attention to airborne precautions must be followed. In addition to the use of respirators and negative-pressure isolation rooms, visitation should be limited when possible; at our institution, two primary visitors may undergo screening chest radiography to ensure that they do not have active pulmonary infection.",

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a reasonable option for patients with pneumonia who have stabilized clinically in the hospital but are judged to require prolonged parenteral treatment. The treatment of lower respiratory tract infections using OPAT has resulted in excellent clinical outcomes and high levels of patient and physician satisfaction [108], [109]. Eligibility for OPAT requires a suitable home environment and the selection of an antimicrobial agent with appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters and drug stability to allow a reasonable dosing schedule at home [110]. An infectious diseases specialist (or a physician knowledgeable about the use of antimicrobial agents in OPAT) and a hospital pharmacist should be involved before discharge in planning for the administration of OPAT. The involvement of discharge planning services in the hospital also can facilitate contact with visiting nurse associations, which can arrange to instruct families in the proper techniques for IV infusions in the home. These agencies can make home visits to observe caregivers and answer questions and obtain blood for laboratory monitoring of disease or medication toxicities. The use of these services, in conjunction with careful follow-up by primary care physicians, provides the best continuity of care from the hospital to the outpatient setting and helps to ensure that patients with pneumonia receive the highest quality of care across the health care spectrum.",
