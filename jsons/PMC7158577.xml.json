There is also one framework residue on the VL domain of each molecule that contributes to the binding interactions. Both the Fab of the anti-idiotypic E225 and the Fab of the idiotypic D1.3 are centered on VL domains of the complementary molecule in the complex. In spite of this interaction involving primarily VL domains, the VH domain on the anti-Id is responsible for 45% of the contacts.

Comparison of the CDRs of the idiotypic D1.3 in the Id\u2013anti-Id complex and the complex between Fab, or Fv with the antigen lysozyme, showed that there are significant side chain conformational changes. This is probably the result of different steric requirements for binding of the lysozyme versus the anti-idiotype by the idiotopic D1.3. Interestingly, there is no conformational change of the side chains when free D1.3 idiotope is compared with that bound to the antigen (Bhat et al., 1990).",

The mimicry is achieved by extensive overlap between the paratope and the idiotope of D1.3. Virtually the same residues of idiotypic D1.3 are involved in binding the original antigen and the anti-idiotope. Furthermore, there is a considerable similarity in the nature of the interactions of the idotypic D1 .3 in the antigen-idiotype and the Id\u2013anti-Id complex, and the affinity of the E5.2 for the D1.3 of 1.4 \u00d7 105/M approaches the affinity between the antigen and D1.3 of 2.7 \u00d7 108/M.",

This was not observed in the case of the D1.3\u2013E225 complex. Interestingly, solvent molecules contribute to the binding mimicry.

The pseudodyad angle relating VL and VH domains is 175\u00b0 for Fab1 and 178\u00b0 for Fab2. That relating CL and CH1 is 169\u00b0 and 173\u00b0 for Fab1 and Fab2, respectively. Both elbow angle and pseudodyad angle values are consistent with values found for other Fabs. Five hypervariable regions of Fab1 can be classified as L12, L21, L31, H11, and H22 (38). Loop H3 has 12 amino acids and forms a long hairpin structure that extends towards L2 and L1 on the light domain. Two ridges on the surface of the combining site are formed by L1, L3 and H3 on one side and H1 and H2 on the other. Four hypervariable regions of the Fab2 can be classified as belonging to the canonical structures L21, L31, H11, and H24 (Chothia et al., 1989). Even though loop H1 can be classified as H11, it has a conformation different from the canonical structure: the side chain of residue Phe 27 is buried within the framework structure instead of residue Phe 29 in the canonical structure model. On the other hand residue Phe 29 of this loop is oriented towards the VL\u2013VH domain interface and partially buried. Sequence analysis of the Fab2 indicated that the L1 region belongs to the mouse kappa light chain subgroup IV (Kabat et al., 1991). This loop has 10 residues and main chain atoms of residues 25\u201327a and residue 33 follow the canonical structure model. Hydrophilic serines between residues 29\u201331 form a turn that is one residue longer than the turn in the L11, loop of HyHel-5. Loop H3 of Fab2 has 10 amino acids and forms a broad turn stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Arg 94 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe 97. The Fab2 CDR\u2019s surface is undulating, with no deep grooves as are observed when the antigen is a small molecule (Davies et al, 1990). A shallow cavity exists between the L1, H3 and H2 loops.",

In the structure of the Id\u2013anti-Id complex (anti-lysozyme D1.3 Fab and its anti-idiotypic E225 Fab) (Bentley et al., 1990) both Fabs are centered on VL domains of opposing Fabs and interact primarily through their VL domains.

The L1 CDR sequence is Val-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser, which differs with the segment on the E2 peplomer beginning at position 276 having sequence Ile-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser by the conservative substitution of valine for isoleucine at the first position. Similarly, the H1 loop is Gly-Phe-Thr-Phe-Asn-Asn, which matches the Gly-Phe-Ser-Phe-Asn-Asn sequence of the antigen beginning at residue 1451. Here again, only the conservative change from serine to threonine marks a difference. These two regions of homology on the anti-idiotope provide important contacts with the idiotypic antibody originally produced in response to antigen. Homologous residues on L1 of the anti-idiotope are involved in 36 van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen bonds, and those on H1 form 18 van der Waals contacts and the one hydrogen bond presented in Table 1.D (pp. 30\u201331) and in Figure 5 (below).

Using these polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies as an immunogen, anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. One of these anti-anti-idiotopes in particular, designated Mab131, was found to bind AII with high affinity (7.3 \u00d7 109/M), a value similar to that of the original antibody which had an affinity constant of 3.2 \u00d7 109/M.

The extensive and intimate contact, judged according to buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals bonds are not consistent with the more tenuous crystal packing interactions usually observed. Interactions are very tight and comparable to those seen in antibody\u2013antigen complexes. In spite of the fact that antibodies and particularly Fab fragments are becoming the most studied family of proteins (Davies and Chacko, 1993, Padlan, 1994), similar self-interaction has never been reported. Furthermore, the original antigen for this anti-anti-antibody is the CDR region of another antibody (anti-idiotypic MK2-23). It is possible that the interaction between the anti-anti-idiotypic mAb GH1002 and the anti-idiotypic MK2-23 involves certain framework regions. These regions are likely to be similar for the two antibodies, and could be the basis for the self-recognition of GH1002 in the crystal.",

Because it would be immunologically futile to prolong an anti-idiotypic cascade indefinitely, evolution of a cascade toward self-neutralization would provide a mechanism for modulation and ultimate termination. Indeed, isologous interactions based on dyad symmetry are usually the basis for energetically favorable protein-protein interactions in oligomers (Monod et al., 1965, Morgan et al., 1979); Id\u2013anti-Id complexes of Fabs already possess pseudo dyad axes, by virtue of the roughly collinear disposition of Fabs, relating framework portions of the molecules (Bentley et al., 1990, Ban et al., 1994, Evans et al., 1994, Fields et al., 1995), and the only parts of the antibody subject to change in an anti-idiotypic series, and therefore capable of exerting self regulation, are the CDRs.",
