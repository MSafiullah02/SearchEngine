These data comprise 20 whole genome sequences from confirmed 32 COVID19 infections in Weifang, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. The data were 33 collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period 34 of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to 35 evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020. 36 The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance 37 and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an 38 estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the 39 early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang 40 took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We 41 therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number 42 than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to 43 evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case 44 ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness. 45 To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods 46 which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence 47 data from Wuhan and exported international cases (Volz et al., 2020) . This analysis has several 48 constraints and requirements: 49 50 Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages 51 imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for 52 location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to 53 epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of 54 new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time. 55 Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID19 56 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infection oc-57 curred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (Keeling and Rohani, 2011) 58 for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation 59 times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak. 60 Variance in transmission rates (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) .To estimate total numbers infected, the 61 phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly 62 influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number 63 of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS 64 epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of 65 transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor 66 will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size (Li et al., 2017) . Recent analyses of sequence 67 data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated 68 cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record (Volz et al., 2020) . Models assuming low 69 variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower .

Figure 1A Table 1 . 84 The estimated number of infections is shown Figure 1C . The time series of confirmed cases 85 should lag the estimated number of infected because of delays from infection to appearance of 86 symptoms and delays from symptoms to diagnosis. We also expect that an unknown proportion of 87 infections will be missed by the surveillance system due very mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic 88 infection. Our estimates do not support the hypothesis that there was a very large hidden burden 89 of infection in Weifang over the period that the sequence data were sampled. Indeed, our central 90 estimate for the number infected on 10th February is 53, which is only slightly in excess of the 44 91 cumulative confirmed cases at the end of February. 92 Table 1 .

Among the 20 Weifang sequences included in 109 this analysis, there is mean pairwise difference of only three single nucleotide polymorphisms and 110 only approximately twice as much diversity observed among the remainder of the sequences we 111 studied. There is correspondingly low confidence in tree topology (Figure Supplement 2), and only 112 three clades had greater than 50% posterior support including one clade which had a monophyletic 113 compoisition of 13 Weifang lineages.

Surveillance of COVID19 is 119 rendered difficult by high proportions of illness with mild severity and an unknown proportion of 120 asymptomatic infection(Guan et al., 2020). The extent of under-reporting and case ascertainment 121 rates has been widely debated. Analysis of genetic sequence data provides an alternative source of 122 information about epidemic size which can be more robust to imperfect case ascertainment. We do 123 not find evidence for a large hidden burden of infection within Weifang. The relatively low estimate 124 of 0 is consistent with a slower rate of spread outside of Wuhan and effective control strategies 125 implemented in late January. 126 While the value of pathogen genomic analyses is widely recognized for estimating dates of 127 emergence(Verity Hill, 2020; Gire et al., 2014) and identifying animal reservoirs(Zhou et al., 2020; 128 Dudas et al., 2018), analysis of pathogen sequences also has potential to inform epidemic surveil-129 lance and intervention efforts.
