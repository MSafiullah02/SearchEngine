The CypD protein crystal structures of 6 fragment hits provided the basis for subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization by fragment merging and linking yielding three different chemical series with either urea, oxalyl or amide linkers connecting millimolar fragments in the S1\u2032 and S2 pockets. We successfully improved the in vitro CypD potencies in the biochemical FP and PPIase assays and in the biophysical SPR binding assay from millimolar towards the low micromolar and submicromolar range by > 1000-fold for some fragment derivatives. The initial SAR together with the protein crystal structures of our novel CypD inhibitors provide a suitable basis for further hit-to-lead optimization.",

            "text": "Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIase) catalyzing the cis-trans interconversion of proline peptide bonds during protein folding. 1, 2 The human cyclophilin protein family consists of 17 highly conserved isoforms, which are abundantly and ubiquitously present in a wide range of tissue types and organisms with functions beyond protein maturation. 2, 3 Among them, Cyclophilin A (CypA) is the major cellular target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA, Fig. 1 ) forming a ternary complex with calcineurin and thus preventing regulation of cytokine gene transcription. [4] [5] [6] Cyclophilins also play a key role in pathophysiological processes such as inflammation and vascular dysfunction, wound healing, innate HIV immunity, hepatitis C infection, host-parasite interactions and tumor biology. 7 Cyclophilin D (CypD) is the mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme, and a key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a cascade of cellular processes linked to multiple sclerosis and cardiovascular disease, making CypD a therapeutic drug target. [7] [8] [9] [10] The crystal structures of several cyclophilins have been determined and show a common fold consisting of two \u03b1helices packing against an eight-stranded anti-parallel P-barrel structure. 11 The cyclophilins contain a large active binding groove composed by several highly conserved hydrophobic, aromatic and polar residues including the catalytic Arg55 located at the entrance of the S1\u2032 proline pocket. 2,12 A second S2 pocket has been identified nearby: it is deep and relatively non-specific, with access controlled by a set of gatekeeper residues. 2 The cyclic peptide CsA binds via specific interactions involving both S1\u2032 and S2 pockets with nanomolar potency to cyclophilins, e.g. to CypD with a PPIase IC 50 of 20 nM. 13 However, CsA and its semisynthetic analogues such as Debio 025 and NIM811 have unfavorable drug-like properties due to high molecular weight, limited solubility and poor bioavailability. 14, 15 Only few small and non-peptidic CypD inhibitors have been published including urea derivatives such as 2, which were discovered by fragment-based lead discovery (Fig. 1) . 10, 16, 17 These urea derivatives demonstrated in vitro PPIase inhibitory activity and antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronaviruses. 16 Protein crystallography of 2 in CypD revealed specific binding of the pyrrolidine ring in the S1\u2032 pocket, while the aniline substituent is bound in the S2 pocket (Supporting information). 13 Our aim was to identify novel chemical hit matter from HTS and fragment screening approaches to develop CypD inhibitors with drug-like properties for prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.",

            "text": "We started our hit identification efforts by high-throughput screening on our corporate compound library with~650,000 compounds using an FP biochemical assay, which resulted in only a small hit rate of 178 hits with IC 50 s < 10 \u00b5M. Disappointingly, none of these hits could be confirmed in orthogonal biophysical CypD binding assays using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and protein-based NMR studies. Due to this outcome, we conducted an additional fragment-based screening campaign using our internal fragment library with 2688 structurally diverse fragments (Supporting information). The fragments were screened by SPR at fixed concentrations of 2 mM using immobilized CypD protein and yielded 168 primary hits. For subsequent hit confirmation, we used CsA at 200 nM for SPR-based competition experiments in compound titration series of 10 concentrations up to 10 mM. The affinity determination by SPR confirmed 58 hits with steady state dissociation constants (K D,ss ) in the range of 1 mM to > 10 mM. The identified fragments represented a large chemical diversity consisting of different aromatic as well as saturated rings as potential proline-mimicking motifs. However, the fragments had only millimolar potencies and overall low ligand efficiencies (LEs 0.1-0.3 kcal/heavy atom) beyond the high LE range of > 0.3 kcal/heavy atom considered as optimal starting point for fragment optimization. 18, 19 We therefore aimed to determine the binding mode in the CypD binding groove for as many fragments as possible by protein crystallography for structureguided optimization. We evaluated 52 fragments by co-crystallization and by soaking into apo crystals of the CypD K175I mutant and obtained 6 crystal structures with clearly defined fragment electron densities in the active site at resolutions of 1.15-2.0 \u00c5 (Table 1 and Supporting information). 20 The 6 fragments displayed a certain variety of binding modes within the CypD binding groove: 3 and 4 are bound in the gatekeeper S2 pocket, 5-7 are located in the proline S1\u2032 pocket and 8 is targeting both S1\u2032 and S2 pockets (Supporting information). All fragment X-ray structures were superimposed with published CypD structures in complex with CsA and urea derivatives such as 2 to define promising fragment linking and merging strategies for hit optimization. These considerations provided the basis of three hit series followed up by medicinal chemistry to improve potency in the biochemical FP and SPR binding assays. The superimposition of CypD crystal structures in complex with the three-dimensional fragment 3 (K D = 7.1 mM, LE = 0.2) and the published urea derivative 2 (PDB-ID: 4J5B) indicated almost perfect matching of the aniline rings in the S2 pocket. The annulated tetrahydropyran ring of 3 binds in a lipophilic sub pocket, which becomes accessible by side chain movement of Arg124 (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the fluorine atom of 3 provided a suitable exit vector towards the urea for fragment merging. We prepared a series of urea derivatives by incorporating the bicyclic fragment 3 in combination with the pocket S1\u2032 substituent of 2 as different stereoisomers according to Scheme 1. 21 The resulting urea derivatives 14-19 showed a clear SAR in the biochemical FP assay as well as in the CypD SPR assay regarding stereochemistry ( Table 2 ). The most potent derivative 14 (FP IC 50 = 60 nM, PPIase IC 50 = 4 nM, SPR K D = 6 nM) had the same stereochemistry as the bicyclic fragment 3 (2R,3S,6R-enantiomer) and the S-methylphenyl substituent of 2 (R-enantiomer), which corresponds to their binding modes in the crystal structure. Fragment merging towards urea 14 resulted in significant potency improvements compared to the starting urea 2 (FP IC 50 = 750 nM, SPR K D = 230 nM) of 12-or 40-fold referring to the FP and SPR assays respectively. The corresponding derivative 15 with the S-methylphenyl substituent as S-enantiomer was significantly less potent (FP IC 50 = 3.6 \u00b5M, SPR K D = 630 nM). Also, the combination of the bicyclic fragment 3 as different stereo isomer (2S,3S,6S-enantiomer) and the S-methylphenyl substituent of 2 as Renantiomer resulted in a clear potency drop (16: FP IC 50 = 1.7 \u00b5M, SPR ",

In contrast, the position of the 16 OH-group is completely shifted and not in H-bond contact to 'water molecule 1', which is involved in a more ideal tetrahedral H-bond network.

In this case, the 8-membered lactam ring of 4 is again located in a lipophilic sub cavity formed by induced fit of Arg124 within the S2 pocket. However, the aniline rings have significantly shifted positions (N-atom distanc\u1ebd 1.8 \u00c5) resulting in suboptimal exit vectors for fragment merging with the urea group. Consequently, we prepared derivatives 20-23 with urea and amide linkers of different length merging the lactam ring of 4 with 2 as R-enantiomer ( Table 2 Fragment hit 8 (K D = 1.1 mM, LE = 0.22) binds with its cyclopentyl and 2-pyridine substituents in the S1\u2032 and S2 pockets respectively, which are linked by an oxalyl group in H-bond contact to the Asn144 backbone atoms and the His168 side chain on one side (Supporting information).

We also evaluated a similar merging strategy of the lactam fragment 4 in combination with 8, but the analogues were again less potent (data not shown). Finally, we replaced the cyclopentyl ring of 27 by the S-methylphenyl substituent of 2 as R-enantiomer to gain additional potency by more optimized interactions in the S1\u2032 pocket. But the resulting analogues did not show improved potencies (31: FP IC 50 > 100 \u00b5M, 32: FP IC 50 > 30 \u00b5M). The protein crystal structure determination of the bicyclic fragment hit 7 (K D > 10 mM) failed by soaking into apo-crystals and by cocrystallization, but we succeeded to solve the structure by soaking of 7 into CypD co-crystals with 4. In the crystal structure, the fragment 7 binds as (1S,2R,6S,7R)-enantiomer in the S1\u2032 proline pocket and forms H-bonds via one of the maleimide carbonyl O-atoms to Ala143 and His168 (Supporting information). The carboxylic acid of 7 is in ionic and H-bond contact to Arg97 and Gln105 respectively and points towards the S2 pocket. The shortest distance between one of the carboxylic O-atoms of 7 and the 1,3-benzodioxole C-atom of the co-crystallized fragment 4 is 3.3 \u00c5, which promptly suggested fragment linking by 1-2 atom linkers (Fig. 4) . We considered a more chemically stable amide instead of an ester for linking the bicyclic fragment 7 and the lactam fragment 4 and prepared a series of amides according to Scheme 3. 24 The benzolactam analogue 34 linked by a N-methylamide group to the bicyclic ring of fragment 7 showed a modest potency improvement (Table 4 , 34: FP IC 50 = 80 \u00b5M, SPR K D = 51 \u00b5M), while the shorter aniline derivative 35 was inactive (FP IC 50 > 1000 \u00b5M). For further fine tuning of the optimal linker length, we evaluated the simple amides 36 and 37 with a methylene or ethylene spacer and an aniline substituent in the S2 pocket. In this case, the shorter methylene derivative 36 showed already a > 1000-fold improvement (FP IC 50 = 2.8 \u00b5M, PPIase IC 50 = 28 \u00b5M, SPR K D = 4.9 \u00b5M) compared to the millimolar potencies of 7 and 4. In contrast, the longer ethylene analogue 37 was only weakly potent (FP IC 50 = 490 \u00b5M). This result corresponds well with the distance of 3.0 \u00c5 between the 7 carboxylic Oatom and the 3-fluorine atom in the overlay of the CypD\u00b77\u00b74 ternary complex with CypD\u00b73 (Fig. 4) .",

The bicyclic ring of 3 is bound in the S2 pocket with specific H-bonds involving also water molecules 1 and 2. The bicyclic norbornane maleimide ring of fragment 7 binds in two alternative conformations (green and yellow) distinguished by 180\u00b0rotation in the S1\u2032 pocket. In both orientations, the maleimide carbonyl O-atom is in H-bond contact to Asn144 and His168. The amide group connecting both fragments forms H-bonds to Arg97 (direct) and Gln116 and His (water mediated). ring of 40 in the S1\u2032 pocket. Both orientations are distinguished by 180\u00b0r otation of the maleimides ring (exo form) in the S1\u2032 pocket resulting in nearly identical positions of the carbonyl O-atom in H-bond contact to Asn144 and His168. Consequently, the bicyclic norbornane ring adopts two alternative orientations in the S1\u2032 proline pocket with vdW-interactions to Phe102, Phe155 and Met103. The amide linker of 40 forms H-bonds directly to Arg97 and Gln105 and water mediated H-bonds to Gly114 and His96. In summary, our fragment-based approaches yielded three different series with either urea, oxalyl or amide linkers connecting millimolar fragments in the S1\u2032 and S2 pockets. We successfully improved the in vitro CypD potencies in the biochemical FP assay and the biophysical SPR binding assays from millimolar towards the low and submicromolar range by > 1000-fold for some fragments. The initial SAR together with the protein crystal structures of our novel CypD inhibitors provide a suitable basis for further hit-to-lead optimization.",
