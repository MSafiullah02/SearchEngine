In addition to being one of the world's most important consumer driven economies, the US has also, for a long time, embraced the concept of the \u201cfree market\u201d in developing economic policy. Free market policies involve the removal of regulatory constraints with the goal of improving commercial competitiveness and delivering overall better economic outcomes. Free trade agreements, and removal of tariffs on imports, are also aspects of regulatory liberalisation that can impact international air freight.",

The first international open skies agreement signed was between the United States and the Netherlands in 1992. Since 1991, there has been a steady increase to the number of open skies agreements with the US, and the number of international routes have grown from 4,859 in 1991 to peak at 8,588 in 2007, just prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Currently there are 7,977 international routes in operational service to the US in 2018, representing a compound growth of 1.85% per annum since 1991 (Transtats, 2019). Moreover, air freight (including mail) carried on international routes with the US had grown from 2,214 in 1991 to 2,785 in 2007 and has since fallen to 2,096 US international routes in 2018 (Transtats, 2019). Unlike the expansion of passenger routes, US international routes carrying cargo have contracted at 0.2% compounded per annum since 1991.",

Almost 75% of open skies agreements with the US contain 7th freedom of the air rights-the carriage of cargo between the US and another country by an airline foreign to both (US Department of Transportation, 2019). Moreover, these agreements often exclude domestic cabotage (the 8th freedom of the air), protecting domestic (i.e. US) airlines from competition in home markets by international carriers, notably operational restrictions to major cargo integrator DHL, which potentially costs the US consumer.",

The timing and impact of the next economic downturn on the air cargo industry may be imminent given the protectionist rhetoric of the current US government (i.e. Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and other trading partners). Air freight has been commonly linked to economic growth (Tasiaux, 2009; Morrell, 2011; Hakim and Merkert, 2016) and is an important factor to merchandise trade, moving some 35% of the value of merchandise goods globally (Shepherd et al., 2016; ATAG, 2018; IATA, 2018a). Section 2 provides an overview of economic and air freight conditions post-GFC. A literature review on the methodology to be applied, namely gravity models, is provided in Section 3. Development and application of the gravity models will be provided in Section 4. Results and discussion form Section 5, with a conclusion to the research provided in Section 6.",

The four largest trading partners with the US, namely China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) accounted for US$168 billion or 40.48% of the value of total US imports by air. From mid-2007 to late 2008, deterioration of financial market confidence in the US triggered the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The demise of the US financial giant Lehman Brothers in 2008 led to direct and indirect consequences for the air freight industry; firstly constrained inter-bank finance made trade difficult for all commercial operations and secondly Lehman Brothers had provided financial backing to Gemini Air Cargo, which subsequently went bankrupt (Morell, 2011, 2013). In light of the crisis, airlines (amongst others) had to reassess the strength of financial partnerships with their banks. The GFC marked a significant decline in US air imports and consumer spending as illustrated in Fig. 1\n.",

Company inventory levels were reduced during this period, and new purchases deferred, impacting international trade and further contributing to declines in air freight. Air freight value (and volume) would both be impacted by these business decisions made due to lower consumer confidence, both during and immediately after the events of the GFC. In 2009, at the peak of the GFC, US air imports had dropped in total value by over 10% to US$367 billion and volume declined by over 25% to 3.2 million tonnes (United States Census Bureau, 2019). Moreover, Japan (US$35.3 billion in air freight trade to the US in 2018) and South Korea (US$20.4 billion), have faced regional competition from China (US$157.6 billion) and subdued growth over the last decade in air freight trade value with the US (United States Census Bureau, 2019).",

These findings appear counterintuitive to a primary goal of air transport liberalisation in fostering competition, which should decrease cost, for the benefit of consumers (Iches, 2010). Achard (2008) develops a gravity model to assess air transport liberalisation on international air cargo flows, finding GDP to be a counterintuitively negative factor, whilst noting that substitution to surface transport modes may impair his results. Vega (2014) developed gravity models for trade between developing countries and established mega-economies such as the US and European Union with GDP per capita, distance, population, air freight rates, and with dummy variables for liberalisation (open skies), landlocked or island nations. An interesting finding of his research is that for a one percent increase in GDP per capita, perishable exports appear to increase by just 0.78% and high value exports by 2.93%.",

Shepherd (2013) confirms that the general approach for gravity modelling estimations is a log-linear formulation and use of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique, sometimes with fixed effects. Fixed effects typically segregate aspects of a region or location and have been applied in air transport research at the regional bloc level (Vega, 2014), national level (Gadala-Maria, 2014), regional level (Gong et al., 2018) or city level (Matsumoto and Domae, 2018, 2019). Cohen (2016) finds that the PPML estimation does not improve the quality of his forecast model over OLS and states that \u201cOLS is the preferred model\u201d when comparing results with Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE). Moreover, in an industry that is measured globally in millions of tonnes (IATA, 2018a), billions of freight tonne-kilometres (World Bank, 2018b) and trillions of US dollars carried (ATAG, 2018), zero trade flows suggests that there simply is no market.

Due to the size of the sample (59 countries, 19 commodity types) and based on values from the largest US trading partner, China, changes to transport costs were capped between 28% and \u221210% and sea freight volumes were capped between +35% and \u221225%.",

At a somewhat disaggregated level, the gravity model was also noticeably effective, although some improvements can be made to the forecasting methodological approach and refinement of data.

Beyond the scope of this paper was air cargo imports to European and North East Asian markets, notably the other two major economic regions of the world, and cross-elasticities of imported products (for example between meat and vegetables) to the US. It is further worth noting that at the time of receiving the proofs for our manuscript in April 2020, COVID-19 had a major impact on the air cargo industry both in the US and globally. We strongly believe that our hypothesis will hold for pandemics such as COVID-19 too, which would highlight the value of gravity models in forecasting during disruption and exogenous shocks to airline markets. Further research in this regard is needed once the data becomes available.",
