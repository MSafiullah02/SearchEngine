            "text": "The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of activity based probes for the detection of enzymatic activities related to a wide range of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). These tools have allowed for the detection of many enzymatic activities in relation to conjugation and deconjugation of PTMs. The greatest success and widest application of this approach have probably been found within the ubiquitin proteasome pathway [1]. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) consists of three different elements with partially opposing, but complementary roles; the ubiquitin conjugating cascade, the deubiquitylating enzymes and the proteasome complex (Fig. 1\n). The ubiquitin conjugating cascade of enzymes (E1, E2, E3 and E4) is responsible for conjugating ubiquitin (Ub)/ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) to other proteins as signaling molecules in several biological processes [2], [3]. The deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) are responsible for removing, trimming or editing the Ub/Ubl modifications from proteins [2]. The proteasome complex, composed of at least three different proteolytically active subunits \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b25, degrades the majority of soluble proteins within the cell following polyubiquitylation [4]. The UPS not only enables the targeted destruction of proteins no longer required by the cell, but also enables the selective deactivation of signaling molecules, removal of pathogenic proteins and production of peptides for presentation to the immune system. The entire pathway comprises close to 1000 genes, is vital for many normal cellular functions and is frequently disrupted in cellular pathologies [5], [6].",

These represent the major enzymatic activities of DUBs and the proteasome respectively. Improved recognition of the protein-based ubiquitin and peptide-derived proteasome probes as compared with small molecule based probes may also contribute. The generation of activity based probes for the ubiquitin pathway as important tools to obtain insights into the ubiquitin proteasome system has been reviewed previously [7], [8], [9], [10]. The focus of this review is the application of activity-based probes in the context of inhibitor development and characterization. This process represents a critical step in arriving at a better understanding of fundamental cellular processes and enables the development of novel targeted therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "Activity-based probes (ABPs) are defined by their ability to target subsets of a complex proteome based on labeling of specific enzyme classes in a covalent fashion. The incorporation of specific tags for detection and enrichment allows for visualization and further analysis for example by tandem mass spectrometry. The ABP approach is highly complementary to mass spectrometry-based proteomics due to the ability to enrich for specifically captured substrates with the aid of an affinity tag. This also distinguishes the method from the use of radiolabeled covalent inhibitors that support detection but not affinity enrichment. A critical parameter is also the choice of reactive group for covalent labeling of the target enzyme at or close to the enzyme active site. Depending on the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis different reactive groups can be chosen for covalent capture. The alkylation of nucleophilic residues (Cys, Ser, Thr) present in protease active sites by reactive electrophiles has been a very successful realization of this method. The utility of ABPs is particularly evident in the study of enzyme systems involved in the attachment and removal of PTMs. Due to the enzyme active site chemistries involved ABP development has been generally more fruitful for the targeting of deconjugating enzymes that usually contain strong nucleophiles at their active sites when compared to the respective ligases/transferases.",

The three subunits responsible for proteolysis also correspond to different activity profiles with respect to substrate specificity which were named after prototypic proteases: chymotrypsin-like activity for \u03b25 (CT-L), trypsin-like activity for \u03b22 (T-L) and petidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing-like (PGPH-L) activity (also referred to as caspase-like) for \u03b21 [13]. Exchange of the active subunits with close homologues can be induced in immune cells [14] and the thymus [15]. This allows for the tuning of the peptide repertoire produced by proteasomal proteolysis, which underscores the importance of presentation of these peptides (after further processing steps) in immune surveillance.",

The most popular designs have been based on the trileucine vinylsulfone (L3VS) sub-structure and on functionalized epoxomicin derivatives. Profiling with these probes is enabled by detection with dansyl [16] and biotin [17], [18] tags and with strong fluorophores [19], [20] as well as by radiolabels [12], [21]. Alternatively, a two step protocol can be applied whereby the tag is attached in a bioorthogonal ligation step following labeling of active proteasome subunits in a cell lysate [22]. This selective ligation is possible through application of the Staudinger ligation [23] or 1,4-triazole formation also known as \"click\" chemistry [24], [25]. A more recent addition to the arsenal of proteasome-directed probes has been the Belacostin A derived dansyl-KF33955 probe [26]. This \u03b2-lactone containing probe was used successfully in the labeling of \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b25 subunits of the 26S proteasome in HeLa cells as well as the 20S proteasome from erythrocytes.",

Subsequently this concept has been extended to the study of proteases specific for ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) [30]. A complex proteome such as a cell or tissue lysate is labeled by incubation with ubiquitin probe, followed by SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting against the epitope tag genetically encoded in the probe construct. Thereby a read-out, which is dependent on DUB abundance and activity, is obtained. This approach was also extended to the investigation of cancer cell lines [29], [31] and patient biopsies [31]. Particularly fruitful was the study of in vitro infection models of viral [32], [33], [34], [35], parasitic [36], [37] and bacterial [38], [39] pathogens. In this way previously unknown DUBs encoded by pathogens were identified and other interactions of pathogen encoded factors with the host ubiquitin proteasome system were elucidated. DUB related pathogen\u2013host interactions have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [40], [41], [42], [43]. Ubiquitin probes have further enabled structural studies on DUB-ubiquitin complexes [44]. In these investigations the crystallization and X-ray diffraction of covalent adducts formed between enzyme and the ubiquitin probe allowed insights into some of the molecular determinants of interactions of DUBs with ubiquitylated substrates.

This finding might be explained by the formation of non-covalent complexes which can be enriched in immunoprecipitations (IPs) under non-denaturing conditions. The targeting and retrieval of ubiquitin ligases by ubiquitin probes have also been observed [52]. Usually the reduced nucleophilicity of Cys residues in this enzyme class (when compared to Cys as part of the catalytic triad in DUB proteases) results in strongly reduced capture. This can apparently be compensated for to a certain extend by strong C-terminal electrophiles conjugated to the Ub probes [52].",

In one format, competition assays between an inhibitor candidate compound and the activity-based probe can be performed in cell lysates. In this type of assay format the competition between the small molecule inhibitor and the probe leads to a reduced labeling profile for the activity-based probe. The loss of signal for labeling of specific target enzymes allows assessment of the specificity of inhibition, while titration of concentration ranges provides a measure of IC50 values for the respective inhibitor. Several features make this type of assay format particularly attractive: The approach represents a cell-based assay in which treatment by the inhibitor candidate can be performed on intact cells. In contrast to the majority of in vitro enzyme assays, a range of active cellular enzymes can be assayed simultaneously. This is only limited by the number of enzymes successfully labeled by the activity-based probe and the representation of active enzymes in the cellular proteome. Quantifiable results can be obtained using various readout formats including immunoblotting, in-gel fluorescence detection or IP followed by quantitative MS-based proteomics.",

A number of DUB inhibitors have been characterized and developed into lead compounds for medicinal chemistry programs.

It is noteworthy that many of the identified lead compounds and inhibitors have the ability to covalently label the active site cysteine residue present in the majority of DUBs (Fig. 3\n).

Labeling of HEK293T cell lysates treated with inhibitors at varying concentrations was performed with the ubiquitin probes HAUbVME and HAUbBr2 to investigate DUB inhibition profiles. As a read-out of these assays immunoblotting against HA-tag or specific DUBs of interest was carried out enabling a rapid assessment of inhibitor specificity. In order to obtain an alternative quantitative read-out format, anti-HA immunoprecipitation (IP) was combined with identification and label-free quantification by mass spectrometry based proteomics (Fig. 4\n). Using this approach, quantitative data illustrating the degree of inhibition of 25 cellular DUBs was obtained. These data were consistent with the in vitro enzyme characterization data, demonstrating that PR-619 exhibits a broad inhibition profile whereas P22077 is a selective inhibitor of USP7 and USP47. Both USP7 and USP47 are considered oncology targets and P22077 and related analogs are the subject of further development as anti-cancer therapeutics [63], [64].",

The readout of the assay was performed by anti-HA immunoblotting and showed reduced probe labeling of USP7 while leaving the competitive labeling of other cellular DUBs unaffected. This result was consistent with the in vitro enzyme inhibition data that also indicated a lack of inhibition of other tested cysteine proteases, DUBs and Ubl specific proteases, but the activity of HBX 19,818 towards the closely related DUB USP47 was not discussed. The mechanism of inhibition was investigated by the authors and covalent labeling of the active site Cys223 in USP7 was demonstrated, indicating that alkylation of this residue leads to irreversible inactivation of the DUB.

Treatment of cells with b-AP15 led to tumor cell apoptosis, which was independent of TP53 status. Additionally an accumulation of high molecular weight Ub conjugates and reduced levels of free ubiquitin were observed and ascribed to the inhibition of the 19S associated DUBs USP14 and UCHL5. The authors concluded that the compound does not act as a broad spectrum DUB inhibitor at the concentration employed, rather it inhibits the proteasome associated DUBs USP14 and UCH-L5. Thus, b-AP15 effectively inhibits proteasomal activity by inhibiting the DUBs that process polyubiquitylated proteins prior to their engagement by the proteasome.",

Following elution the captured peptides were analyzed by quantitative proteomics experiments using a targeted LC\u2013MS2 approach. This detection method significantly improved the signal to noise ratios and allows detection of lower amounts of analyte. Quantitative inhibition data for over 200 kinases with six kinase inhibitors was obtained by this method.

New therapies in the UPS will employ the manipulation of DUB activity in a highly selective manner to achieve the desired outcomes. Therefore inhibition of selected intracellular DUB activities will receive increasing attention as a strategy for pharmacological intervention in disease. DUBs with a validated role in oncology are expected to be the first in line for future DUB inhibitors.

Specificities and overlapping reactivities of ubiquitin-like proteases were investigated by analogous Ubl probes. Inhibitor development has been facilitated through competitive labeling assays enabling elucidation of inhibition profiles in a cellular environment. In addition, natural product derived kinase probes have demonstrated the protein targets of these covalent inhibitors, indicating previously unknown molecular targets and providing information in situations where specificities of the respective compounds are not always fully elucidated. The importance of access to selective inhibitors for basic cell biology and drug development makes this area highly suited for successful industry-academia collaborations.",
