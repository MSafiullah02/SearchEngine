            "text": "In 1971, the OEP was assigned the task of monitoring a new form of crisis called the\u201cWage Price Freeze\u201d [12]. This new role for the OEP included among others, to \u201cmonitor nationwide compliance, examine and determine requests for exemptions and prosecute violations\u201d (p. 5) in relation to wage and price changes in the economy. This led to the advent of a flexible system called the Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index (EMISARI). EMISARI was a system designed to facilitate effective communication between people involved in monitoring the Wage Price Freeze situation. The system was designed to integrate people and data into a common platform that could be updated regularly by people who were non-technical administrators [12]. The EMISARI system was flexible and enabled several hundreds of people to collaborate in responding to a crisis [12]. [12] presented complete design principles and guidelines for developing an EMIS. [13, p.6] claimed that \u201cEMISARI incorporated many of the features called for today under the current rubric of knowledge systems\u201d. The crux of this paper is 9 design premises, 5 components of DERMIS conceptual design, 8 general design principles and specification and 3 supporting design considerations and classifications. DERMIS is a perfect example to describe an EMIS.",

Tacit knowledge is the knowledge that cannot be expressed in words whereas explicit knowledge refers to knowledge that can be expressed in words and numbers [29], [30].

This could lead to difficulties in making accurate decisions, under time-pressured and intense situations, while responding to a particular disaster situation. In this context, we suggest that a KMS can be used for capture and then re-use of specific crisis response knowledge which can support decision making when a crisis actually occurs. The practice of selectively applying knowledge from previous experiences during turbulent moments of decision making, to current and future decision making activities with the express purpose of improving the organization's effectiveness, would be possible via a KMS. In addition, we further add that given the dynamic nature of disaster situations, coupled with different inputs and requirements from various stakeholder groups, a disaster manager and center therein, is subject to information overload, which can prevent timely and accurate decision making. A well tested and implemented KMS in this context can help to decide what to look at, what decisions to focus on, and what decisions can be made automatically and/or in advance.",

We first searched two online databases that encompass a vast range of IS research, as well as disaster-related research.i.Association of Information Systems Electronic Library (AISeL)The reason for choosing AISeL is given that major IS journals such as the Journal of the Associations of Information Systems (JAIS), MIS Quarterly (MISQ), Information Systems Journal (ISJ), Journal of Information Technology Theory and Appplication (JITTA), Communications of the Association of Information Systems (CAIS), Pacific Asia Journal of the Association of Information Systems (PAJAIS), Business & Information Systems Engineering (BISE), and Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems (SJIS), and conference proceedings such as Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS), Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), and Pacific-Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS) are listed in this library. We launched our first search in this online database that requires subscription. Keywords were entered based on Table 1. We gathered all peer-reviewed papers within the time period selected. We realized that our search for \u201cKMS + disaster\u201d or \u201cKMS + emergency\u201d did not list all papers that contain the two sets of keywords; instead, the list yielded many irrelevant papers for the aforementioned keywords. Another problem that we encountered was the results were mostly from conference proceedings, and very few were from journals.ii.EmeraldWe proceeded to search the Emerald online database, which has a large number of disaster-related papers. Emerald has more than 35,000 full-text articles encompassing over 100 reputable management journals. We recorded the journal results to ensure that we collect only peer-reviewed papers, as the advanced search of Emerald does not separate papers based on peer-review status. We had to search based on keyword combination within the journal repository. We recorded all results in the keywords table.\nResults for \u201cKMS + disaster\u201d and \u201cKMS + emergency\u201d were very large. We went through each listed paper so as not to miss the important ones. We also faced problems similar to those we faced when we used AISeL. The search using Emerald did not list papers with the given keywords only. Our selection criterion, therefore, was to accept all papers that discussed KMS/IS for disasters and reject all papers that discussed either KMS or disasters only, without one relating to the other. Although the search by disaster/emergency yielded a large number of papers from the total number of papers listed in AISeL for disaster and emergency, only 0.7% were related to \u201cKMS + disaster\u201d and only 0.4% were related to \u201cKMS + emergency.\u201d The Emerald list has slightly more relevant papers than AISeL, with 5% of the papers for \u201cKMS + disaster\u201d and 5% for \u201cKMS + emergency\u201d. The overall search results by online databases are shown in Table 2\n.Stage 2\nIndividual Journals/Conferences\nWorried that we might lose a number of important papers in the second stage, we decided to sift through each of the journals and conferences in AISeL, and the journals that frequently appeared in the Emerald general search, such as Disaster Prevention and Management (DPM). We managed to collect a number of papers that were not listed in the general search within the selected online database. We narrowed the search by using the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) of the individual journals in the search.Aside from the journals listed in AISeL and DPM, we have purposefully selected papers from the International Journal of Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management (IJISCRAM), which provides an outlet for innovative research in IS for crisis response and management. IJISCRAM has published four volumes from 2009 to 2012 (12 issues thus far). The journal is listed in the InfoSci-Journal online database, a premier research database featuring over 145 cutting-edge journals in information science and technology. Fifty papers have been published in the journal between 2000 and 2011. An advanced search launched in the InfoSci-Journal online database using the keywords listed only one paper under the \u201cKMS + disaster/emergency\u201d keywords. Given our intention to find research gaps, we decided to analyze the 50 papers to learn more about the nature of the papers in this journal. Other journals related to disaster and emergency that we decided to include in this research are Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC), Disaster Management and Response (DMR), and Journal of Enterprise Information Management (JEIM).Aside from the IS conferences listed in AISeL, we selected two more conference proceedings for this analysis, namely, Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management Conference (ISCRAM) and Hawaii International Conference on System Science (HICSS). ISCRAM and HICSS are renowned conferences in IS. ISCRAM brings together a research community dedicated to the promotion of exchange of knowledge and the deployment of IS for crisis management. ISCRAM has organized nine conferences to date. We selected only the papers from the 2011 ISCRAM conference proceedings due to time constraints and the limited scope of this paper. HICSS is another prominent IS conference held on an annual basis in Hawaii. Although it started in 1995, HICSS only began to have a special track in emergency management information systems in 2006. We searched through the HICSS papers starting from 2006 to 2011. Overall, ISCRAM, HICSS, CAIS, and AMCIS are the four conferences that have relevant papers for this analysis.Stage 3\nSpecial Issues\nWe then searched for KMS papers on disasters to include special issues. We searched through Google with the same keywords. We added \u201cspecial issue\u201d to obtain special issues only. We only checked up to the second page of the Google search results due to many irrelevant hits. We found that combined-keyword search such as \u201cspecial issues + knowledge management systems + disaster/emergency\u201d gives less relevant hits compared to search with combined keywords that are more general, such as \u201cspecial issue + disaster/emergency.\u201d We collected 11 special issues and from which, only five have published papers that are IS-related. The rest are either non-IS papers, general disaster issues, or engineering papers. The total number of relevant papers from this source is 19.The results based on all the abovementioned sources and keyword sets in Table 1 are shown in Table 3\n. A total of 8408 papers were listed when the keyword \u201cKM\u201d was used. When we searched for KMS, the number dropped to 751. When we used the keyword sets \u201cKMS + disaster\u201d and \u201cKMS + emergency,\u201d 123 papers were generated. After a careful selection based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which is described in the following section, 141 papers pertaining to KMS and disaster/emergency were identified.\n",

A number of researchers do not necessarily mention the term KM or KMS in the context of working with (design/implementation/assessment) of EMIS in relation to disaster management. In this regard, we call for a closer alignment between EMIS and KMS, given that at times, the objectives of both EMIS- and KMS-driven systems are similar in the area of supporting disaster/emergency management. In terms of use, the papers focused on emergency response and rescue (Table 5). Another popular use is for decision support. Very few papers describe EMIS-KMS use for pre-disaster stages, such as training, preparedness, mitigation, and prevention. We also find that although the majority of the authors have conducted an exploratory and experimental case study method, a limitation exists on action research that aims to solve real problems by introducing change into the social setting (Table 14\n).

Firstly a well-designed KMS can bring a group of experts together\u2014thus offering a powerful platform for sharing prior experience in managing disasters. This knowledge base can in turn be used to aid timely response disaster situations. Although the idea of using a KMS to aid disaster management has attracted some interest in the last decade, the ideas inherent in applying expert knowledge to aid disaster planning and response are arguably not new. [108] introduced the notion of using Delphi, more than three decades ago and suggested the importance of expert viewpoints being brought together to address disaster management issues. The major difference though between this seminal work and contemporary literature/projects on KMS is that while the former systems were predominantly led by structured-military style of disaster management driven by manual procedures, the latter systems can be designed to offer more robust and flexible creation, storage, sharing and ultimately dissemination of a disaster related knowledge base. Secondly, even within the realm of a KMS to support disaster management efforts, literature suggests that these systems can benefit from the utilization of social networking ideas\u2014driven by web 2.0 (and beyond) architectures, to offer a more dynamic and real time use of KMS in an actual disaster situation [12], [54], [77], [109], [110].",

[109] in this regard assert that any knowledge structure should support the nature of an ever evolving context, allow flexible alterations and thus classification of meaning in relation to disasters. The authors further add that modern technologies such as wikis, blogs, and other forms of Web 2.0 and beyond architectures support these requirements [109].\u2022Support both informational and knowledge requirements of different roles played by emergency planners and responders (i.e. allow communities to share both tacit and explicit knowledge domains pertaining to disasters that are highly contextual) [12], [111].\u2022Handle timely coordination efforts through both synchronous and asynchronous feedback, during the different phases of a disaster situation. In this regard, we propose that an Emergency Management Information System supports mainly structural/organizational requirements in managing disasters.

This methodology was used to understand the extent and nature of applied KMS research in aid of emergency/disaster management. From an extensive search of 8408 papers in the KM domain, our search list was narrowed to 51 papers (0.6%) that have examined applied-KMS for disaster/emergency. Our in-depth review of the 51 papers suggests that a scope for more significant research on the four major areas is present. First, an urgent need exists for researchers to streamline the use of terminologies pertaining to emergency/disaster management. Second, we feel that more work can be done to ascertain if KMS (for emergency management) and EMIS share similar goals or otherwise. The extent of the similarities/differences between KMS-EMIS in this context could also be further explored. Third, only three papers clearly use an action research approach and relate KMS to disaster/emergency management, despite the call for IS researchers to conduct more applied work based on action research methodology [107]. Finally, more empirical work is required to better understand the determinants of KMS success factors in the context of emergency/disaster management.",
