            "text": "Previously, it was reported that viral infection, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA replication operated efficiently in two RSV\u2010inoculated human epithelial cell lines (HEp\u20102 and A549) but not in an RSV\u2010inoculated human mast\u2010cell line, HMC\u20101. To address the hypothesis that HMC\u20101 lacks the machinery required for RSV replication [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009], a cDNA subtraction assay was performed using HMC\u20101 cells and two human epithelial cell lines (A549 and HEp\u20102). Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), A549 or HEp\u20102 cells were used as the tester, and HMC\u20101 cells were used as the driver. The cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, first hybridization, and second hybridization steps were performed following the manufacturer's protocol, with modifications. After the second hybridization step, PCR and nested PCR were performed using Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech) and primers supplied in the PCR\u2010select cDNA Subtraction Kit. The obtained PCR products were then cloned into the pT7Blue2\u2010vector (EMD4B biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ), and colonies were selected. The subtraction assay was performed three times, yielding a total of 49 clones for A549 versus HMC\u20101 and 85 clones for HEp\u20102 versus HMC\u20101. The sequences of these clones were confirmed using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SP6 and U19mer reverse primers. Using BLASTn to identify sequence homologies, three genes (Cytokeratin 18, GenBank accession no. X12883; Laminin receptor homolog, S35960; and H. sapiens CL100 mRNA for protein tyrosine phosphatase, X68277) were identified as common to both A549 versus HMC\u20101 and HEp\u20102 versus HMC\u20101 experiments (Table I). Among them, cytokeratin 18 (C18) was detected in 2 out of 85 tests (HEp\u20102 vs. HMC\u20101 cells) and in 19 out of 49 tests (A549 vs. HMC\u20101 cells).",

[2007] reported a close physical interaction between filamentous actin and the virus in RSV infection involving inclusion bodies and viral filaments. It was previously reported that RSV infection induced the up\u2010regulation of C17 gene expression in a NF\u2010kB signaling pathway\u2010dependent manner, and the expression of C17 was associated with the syncytia formation of RSV [Domachowske et al., 2000]. Garcia\u2010Barreno et al. [1988] reported that N protein of RSV required a maturation period after synthesis to associate with certain cytoskeletal intermediate filaments. They also reported that C18 in RSV\u2010infected HEp\u20102 cells was modified in a way other than phosphorylation. Thus, a relationship between RSV replication and C18 has been suggested, but it is unclear whether C18 plays a role in RSV replication.",

There were no marked differences in mRNA expression of vimentin or \u03b3\u2010actin among the cell types except for vimentin expression in HEp\u20102 cells. \u03b2\u2010Actin expression was slightly lower in A549 and HEp\u20102 cells relative to HMC\u20101 cells. By contrast, the expression of C18 mRNA in A549 and HEp\u20102 cells was 100\u2010 to 1,000\u2010fold greater than in HMC\u20101 cells (n = 4, P < 0.01). These findings show that the RSV\u2010susceptible cell lines express C18 while the unsusceptible cell line does not. Taken together, these data suggest that C18 might be involved in the replication of RSV in HEp\u20102 and A549 cells. Because C18 is predominantly expressed in HEp\u20102 cells [Price et al., 1988], and was identified by subtraction experiments as one of the genes expressed in both of the RSV\u2010sensitive cell lines but not in HMC\u20101 cells, the role of C18 in RSV replication was examined further.",

Although HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cell growth was slower than that of the original HMC\u20101 cells, the expression of these genes did not affect cell viability (Fig. 2a).

Productive RSV RNA replication in HMC\u20101 cells was not detected by plaque assay in a previous study [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009]; therefore, in this study the replication of RSV in HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cells was detected using real\u2010time PCR. The consensus RSV type A and B/RSV matrix gene probe and primer set described by Kuypers et al. [2004] was used. RSV RNA was quantified using a standard curve obtained from serially diluted virus stocks that were pre\u2010titrated by plaque assay; the obtained values were normalized with the 18s rRNA values from the same sample. Therefore, the RSV RNA copy number was determined as the ratio of the log10PFU/1 ng of 18s rRNA. The relationship between PFU value and RNA copy number was confirmed in the present study [Shirato et al., 2007; Shirato and Taguchi, 2009]. First, RSV was directly inoculated onto the cells and incubated at 34\u00b0C; viral RNA was detected at the indicated number of days postinfection (dpi) (Fig. 3a). Identical to the previous report, a >100\u2010fold productive increase in RSV RNA was seen in the A549 cells, while the copy number of RSV RNA was low in the HMC\u20101 cells over the course of infection. In contrast, the amount of RSV RNA in HMC\u20101C8/18 cells increased slightly but was significantly higher than that in HMC\u20101 cells (n = 4; P < 0.01). As described previously, RSV was able to infect HMC\u20101, but the efficiency of RSV infection in HMC\u20101 was very low [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009]. It has been reported that spinoculation is a good method for forcing virion attachment to cells for retroviruses and coronaviruses [O'Doherty et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2006]. Therefore, spinoculation (3,000 rpm for 2 h at 4\u00b0C) was performed to increase viral infectivity. The spinoculation of RSV increased the amount of virus entering the HMC\u20101 cells by two\u2010 to threefold compared with standard inoculation (data not shown). As a result, the amount of RSV RNA was increased to the level in A549 cells at 4 dpi, whereas that in HMC\u20101 was unchanged (Fig. 3b, n = 4; P < 0.01). These results suggest that the amount of RSV RNA in the HMC\u20101 cells increased in the presence of C8/18.",

RSV\u2010containing 10% fetal calf serum\u2010Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (FCS\u2010IMDM) was added to the cells and spinoculated at 3,000 rpm for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 34\u00b0C in 10% FCS\u2010IMDM. At the indicated dpi, the cells and supernatants were collected separately, and the amount of virus was determined by plaque assay using HEp\u20102 cells. As shown in Figure 3c, a large number of infectious virus particles were detected in the HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cell fraction, and the titer was similar to that in A549 cells; in contrast, a productive increase in virus was not seen in HMC\u20101 over the course of infection. Conversely, the amount of infectious virus in the HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cell supernatant was 100\u2010fold lower than that in A549 cells, although the titer was 10\u2010fold higher than that in HMC\u20101 during the same period (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that infectious virus was produced in the HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cell fraction after spinoculation and that the mean of virus release into the HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 culture medium was different from that into the A549 medium.",

A549 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying a C18\u2010specific or control shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were selected and cloned in the presence of 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin. C18 expression in the knocked\u2010down A549 cells was decreased, and the knock down of C18 influenced C8 expression (Fig. 4a). C18 mRNA expression was decreased to 24 \u00b1 4%, and that of C8 was decreased to 49 \u00b1 5% compared with the shRNA\u2010controlled A549 cells (Fig. 4b). The sequence homology between C18 and C8 is about 50%, and it is possible that the shRNA for C18 might affect the C8 gene. Next, the cells were infected with RSV, and the titers were determined at 2 and 4 dpi by plaque assay; the results are presented as the relative titer (%); that in the shRNA\u2010controlled cells was 100%. As shown in Figure 4c, the RSV titer decreased to 45 \u00b1 20% and 7 \u00b1 4% at 2 and 4 dpi, respectively. This result suggests that the production of descendant viruses in A549 cells decreases depending on the amount of C8/18. Garcia\u2010Barreno et al. [1988] reported that C18 in RSV\u2010infected HEp\u20102 cells received some modification, and they suggested a relationship between RSV replication and C18. However, it was unclear whether C18 plays a role in RSV replication. The results of the present study show that the production of RSV was altered depending on the presence or absence of C8/18 because the amount of RSV increased in C8/18\u2010expressing HMC\u20101 cells and decreased in A549 cells expressing reduced levels of C8/18. These findings suggest that RSV replication is influenced by C8/18 and that RSV production is increased in the presence of C8/18.",

This increase was associated with fusion formation, and blocking the F protein by a specific antibody prevented it. Moreover, the localization of C17 was consistent with cell fusion [Domachowske et al., 2000]. Thus, RSV infection itself could alter the expression profile of the intracellular filament network in the infected cell and could induce the expression of cell components needed for the virus to spread via cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission.",

In adenovirus infection, the cleavage of C18 by adenovirus proteinase causes destruction of the cytoskeletal network, which is thought to promote cell lysis and nascent virion release [Staufenbiel et al., 1986; Chen et al., 1993].
