            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) continues to cause serious economic losses in chicken production globally. IB virus (IBV) replicates in upper respiratory tract tissues, with the resulting bronchi infection causing severe disease in young birds. Certain IBV strains cause greater systemic infections by replicating in different tissues, including the kidney (causing nephritis), the oviduct (causing decreased egg production), and the intestinal tract (Ganapathy et al., 2012). Vaccination has been considered the most reliable approach for controlling IBV infection (Meeusen et al., 2007). However, continuous emergence of new variant viruses may lead to inadequate protection and control of IBV (De Wit, 2000; de Wit et al., 2011). Concurrent circulation of both classic and variant IBVs have been identified in most parts of the world, raising major challenges to global prevention and control efforts. During the past few decades, there have been reports of new virulent field isolates that represent variant strains, which can cause wide tissue tropism and high pathogenicity (Gelb et al., 1991; Jackwood, 2012; Shaw et al., 1996; Zanella et al., 2000). Though the mechanisms behind chickens\u2019 varying susceptibility to different IBV infections have been studied, little to no data is available on comparative immunopathogenesis on recently emerged IBVs.",

In chickens infected with the KIIa genotype, simultaneous peaks in the viral copy number, and upregulation of mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 factor (LITAF), were observed at 7 dpi in the trachea and 9 dpi in the kidney.

These cells rapidly recognize infectious agents through PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Prominent among these are TLRs. An upregulation of TLR2, TLR3, TLR6 and TLR7 mRNA expression has been reported in tracheal epithelial cells after attenuated IBV-M41 intranasal inoculation (Guo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006). Its function in viral immunology is well established (Le Goffic et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007). MDA5 expression levels were reported to be significantly increased in chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic IBV infection, suggesting a role for chicken MDA5 limiting IBV infection (Cong et al., 2013). In a more recent study, it has been shown that in vitro virulent IBV infection leads to a significant induction of INF\u03b2 transcription through an MDA5-dependent activation of the IFN response (Kint et al., 2015).",

IBV 885 causes high mortality, poor weight gain and severe renal damage, while IBV QX causes renal and reproductive problems. Viruses were propagated in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs via the allantoic cavity.

Confirmation of each genotype was done by RT-PCR (Chen et al., 1996; Worthington et al., 2008), followed by commercial Sanger sequencing. Results showed that each virus had 99% similarity across the part-S1 region, with the published sequences. RT-PCR showed that allantoic fluid was free of Newcastle Disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), and culture showed the fluid to be free of mycoplasma, bacterial or fungal contaminations by culture.",

Fig. 6 B shows that at 7 dpi, a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the expression of IL-6 was noticed in chicks infected with IBV M41 compared to IBV 885 or QX. No significant (P < 0.05) changes in the level of IL-6 expression was seen in any infected group at any other time points. At 1 dpi, LITAF transcription levels in all infected groups were significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated compared with the uninfected control group. At 3 dpi, LITAF mRNA expression levels in all infected groups were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated compared with the control group, but without any significant (P < 0.05) difference between infected groups. LITAF mRNA expression was seen to have the same pattern as IL-6 in the trachea. At 7 dpi, the IBV M41 infected group showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression levels when compared to IBV 885 or QX (Fig. 6 C).",

The investigation of local immunological and cytokine induced mechanisms involved in IBV pathogenesis will help to elucidate the IBV-host interaction. Pathogenic mechanisms of IBV may differ between IBV strains, particularly regarding the kinetics, magnitude, and duration of local inflammatory responses and the immune mechanisms in the target organs. In this study, we investigated the differential immunopathogenesis in chickens infected with three IBV strains used previously for an in vitro study (Chhabra et al., 2016). Infected chicks displayed mild clinical signs like tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, head shaking and eye scratching, similar to signs which have been observed following infection with other virulent IBVs (Ambali and Jones, 1990; Butcher et al., 1990; Dolz et al., 2012). The onset and duration of these clinical signs differed between IBV infected groups, indicating differences in the susceptibility of chicks to infection by these three IBV strains. The differential modulation of PRRs (TLR and MDA5), type I IFNs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in chicks, and their association with both the viral load profile and histopathological changes induced by different IBVs were examined.",

In this study, IL-6 transcripts were found to be directly related to renal lesions in chicks challenged with a nephropathogenic strain of IBV. In the more susceptible S-line chicks, these IL-6 levels were 20 times higher than those in the more resistant HWL chicks. Concurrent with our findings, it has been reported that chicks expressed differential immune responses to two IBV strains with different genotypes, KIIa and ChVI (Jang et al., 2013). In chicks infected with the KIIa genotype, simultaneous peaks in the histopathological severity, viral copy number and upregulation of mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) and LITAF were observed in the trachea at 7 dpi and the kidney at 9 dpi. This has also been supported by previous studies in which upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, induced by the M41 strain of IBV, was found to be partially associated with the pathological alterations and/or viral load in trachea of non-immune challenged chicks (Okino et al., 2014, 2017). Interestingly, in our study of tracheal mRNA expression values for these inflammatory cytokines, levels were significantly higher in IBV M41 infected chicks compared to IBVs 885 and QX. In contrast, levels were higher for IBV 885 and QX infected groups in the kidney, compared to IBV M41, suggesting a role for these cytokines in the development of different histopathological lesions caused by different IBVs in these organs.",

Concurrent with TLR3 and MDA5 activation, we found a significant up-regulation of IFN\u03b2, but not IFN\u03b1, mRNA expression after IBV infection at 1 dpi in the trachea and 3 dpi in the kidney. Many previous studies claim that activation of the TLR3 pathway contributes to an up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 production in chickens (Kameka et al., 2014; Karpala et al., 2008; Parvizi et al., 2012). The kinetics of IFN response observed in our study is in line with the previous studies. However, a more recent study alternatively showed that MDA5, not TLR3, is involved in the detection of IBV (Kint et al., 2015). This is despite higher mRNA levels of MDA5 and TLR3 correlating with the most pathogenic strains of IBV in trachea and kidney. We also noted that tracheal samples from chicks infected with IBV M41 resulted in significantly greater IFN-\u03b2 expression when compared to those infected with IBV 885 or QX. In contrast, IBV 885 and QX infection caused higher induction of this gene than IBV M41 in the kidney. Early studies on gamma coronaviruses in chickens also suggested that IBV-induced IFN production is variable and dependent on both the virus strain and cell type (Holmes and Darbyshire, 1978; Otsuki et al., 1987, 1988).",

Our results indicate that higher upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression (such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) and LITAF are induced by the IBV M41 strain in the trachea and IBV 885 and QX in the kidney. This result is in conjunction with the severity of respiratory and renal histopathological lesions caused by these viruses. Further studies may employ these findings to understand the underlying mechanisms of host responses to emerging global IBVs or vaccination-challenge studies.",
