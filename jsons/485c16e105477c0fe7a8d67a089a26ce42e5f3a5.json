One of these embodies 'permissive' mechanism which would allow autoimmune stimulation by default: breakdown of tolerance of aberrations of suppressive regulation (mediated by suppressor T cells or idiotypic interactions) fall within this category. The other type of phenomena are those which would actively stimulate autoimmune attack. It is well established that immunogenic presentation of antigen to helper T cells is normally achieved in the context of Class I1 molecules expressed on the surface of conventional antigen-presenting cells (1). Thus, if one could demonstrate an 'inappropriate' expression of Class I1 products by epithelial cells one could postulate that they may then be able to present as autoantigens their own specialized, tissue-specific cell surface molecules, which under normal circumstances would not be presented to the immune system in any significant amounts (2). In this way, the cells which are the target of an autoimmune attack could play an active role in promoting their own recognition and subsequent destruction.",

But of more direct significance to autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) was the observation that thyrocytes in frozen sections of glands from Hashimoto's and most Graves' disease patients are strongly Class 11-positive as well as having enhanced expression of HLA Class I (4). These initial data in thyroid have been confirmed by a number of groups ( 5 , 6 ) , and have also been extended by the findings of inappropriate Class I1 expression by epithelial of a variety of organs when subject to autoimmune attack (7). This indicates the potential importance of antigen presentation by target cells in a wide range of diseases.",

Londei and M. Feldmann. The line employed, HA1.7, is specific for a defined peptide fragment (p20) of the influenza A haemagglutinin molecule, which it recognizes in association with DQwl (8). Class 11' thyrocytes from a Graves' disease patient of the appropriate HLA type were indeed found to stimulate proliferation of HA1.7 in the presence of p20, but not an irrelevant peptide of haemagglutinin, and this presentation was blocked by monoclonal anti-Class I1 antibodies (9). However, unlike autologous monocytes, the thyrocytes were unable to present the whole virus (fixed or live), suggesting that they cannot process complex antigens for presentation at the cell surface. This did not necessarily mean that thyroid cells would be unable to present their own surface molecules as autoan-80 G. E Bottazzo et al. Acta Med Scand, Suppl. 715",

The interaction with autologous thyrocytes could again be blocked with monoclonal anti-Class I1 antibodies.

In this disease, the insulin-producing beta cells, which are the target of the pathogenic process, aberrantly express Class I1 molecules, although the other islet endocrine cells and the exocrine cells of the pancreas remain Class 11- (19, 20) . However, when experiments were performed 'in vitro', only a small proportion of cultured human beta cells were induced to express Class I1 by rIFN-gamma, although the exocrine and ductal cells in these cultures become strongly Class 11' (21). But induction of Class I1 in cultured islet cells can be achieved with a combination of IFN-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or lymphotoxin (LT), although TNF or LT alone have no effect (22, and submitted). Unlike the in vivo pathological situation, IFN-gamma plus TNF/LT led to induction of Class I1 in the glucagon cells and exocrine/ductal cells as well as in the beta cells of the pancreatic cultures. This raises the possibility that synergism between IFN-gamma and TNF or LT is not the mechanism initiating beta cell Class I1 expression in diabetes, although it could have a potentiating effect. Alternatively, effective beta cell specificity could be explained by localized release of these mediators in vivo, with their short half-life limiting their sphere of action, possibly together with yet another signal acting specifically on beta cells. In any case, it is clear that our in vitro systems do not fully reproduce the in vivo situation as yet.",

This is supported by recent experiments in our laboratory in which epithelial cell lines were derived from thyroid monolayers by transfection with a plasmid containing the early region of SV40 viral DNA: a proportion of the cells in these lines showed constitutive Class I1 expression (23, and in preparation). Adifferent example is provided by the finding that rat astrocytes express Class I1 following non-infective interaction with a murine neurotropic coronavirus Another possibility is that factors other than IFN-gamma, derived from non-lymphocytic cells (e.g. macrophages or endothelial cells), might activate Class I1 genes.

In this disease, the insulin-producing beta cells, which are the target of the pathogenic process, aberrantly express Class I1 molecules, although the other islet endocrine cells and the exocrine cells of the pancreas remain Class 11- (19, 20) . However, when experiments were performed 'in vitro', only a small proportion of cultured human beta cells were induced to express Class I1 by rIFN-gamma, although the exocrine and ductal cells in these cultures become strongly Class 11' (21) . But induction of Class I1 in cultured islet cells can be achieved with a combination of IFN-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or lymphotoxin (LT), although TNF or LT alone have no effect (22, and submitted) . Unlike the in vivo pathological situation, IFN-gamma plus TNF/LT led to induction of Class I1 in the glucagon cells and exocrine/ductal cells as well as in the beta cells of the pancreatic cultures. This raises the possibility that synergism between IFN-gamma and TNF or LT is not the mechanism initiating beta cell Class I1 expression in diabetes, although it could have a potentiating effect. Alternatively, effective beta cell specificity could be explained by localized release of these mediators in vivo, with their short half-life limiting their sphere of action, possibly together with yet another signal acting specifically on beta cells. In any case, it is clear that our in vitro systems do not fully reproduce the in vivo situation as yet.",

One possibility is that certain viruses might directly induce Class If. This is supported by recent experiments in our laboratory in which epithelial cell lines were derived from thyroid monolayers by transfection with a plasmid containing the early region of SV40 viral DNA: a proportion of the cells in these lines showed constitutive Class I1 expression (23, and in preparation) . Adifferent example is provided by the finding that rat astrocytes express Class I1 following non-infective interaction with a murine neurotropic coronavirus Another possibility is that factors other than IFN-gamma, derived from non-lymphocytic cells (e.g. macrophages or endothelial cells), might activate Class I1 genes. Precedents for this include the production of a novel form of interferon by macrophages infected with lentiviruses (25) and the production of an Ia-inducing factor by a murine macrophage tumour cell line treated with IFN-gamma (26) .",
