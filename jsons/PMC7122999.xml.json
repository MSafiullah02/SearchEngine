Therefore, for the teaching purposes set here, we are sharing some of our studies in general immunology and some scientific and philosophical considerations concerning biological agents living in the environment and their relations with humans, in the very wide endeavours of ecological relationships, parasitism, immunological defenses and infectious disease mechanisms. All these concepts must be studied not only for the biological survival and defense of each individual in the environment but also for social prevention purposes, in the event of criminal use of biological agents (bioterrorism) aimed at harming human populations in different times and different geographical sites.",

Biological evolution of species progressively produced today's forms of life, as we observe them. Millions of species co-exist today and share the stage (biosphere). Evolution soon registered colonies of unicellular beings, with the advantage of wider and specialized cellular functions but with the problem of preventing undesirable aggregations (casual or purposely parasitic and potentially dangerous situations anyway). Consequently, the need of surveillance by an efficient \u201cimmune system\u201d is always present. The basic need of this surveillance system was (and always is) to preserve the genetic integrity of the individual being and the survival of the colony (multicellular entity): any novelty cannot be \u201ctolerated\u201d and regular cells (\u201cself\u201d) must be quickly recognized as such, while stranger cells (\u201cnot self\u201d) must be eliminated (rejected) efficiently [2, 3].",
