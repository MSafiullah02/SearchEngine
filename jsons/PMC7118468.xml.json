Multiple reports have documented transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially in more endemic areas. Confounding the potential problem is the fact that acid-fast staining of donor secretions is not routine, and would further delay in organ placement if widely practiced. Fortunately, the apparent risk is small, and the disease is largely treatable. Recommending more extensive testing is not likely to be helpful.",

Of the 2 environmental fungal genera encountered commonly in lung transplantation, Aspergillus and Candida species, it appears that the latter is more likely to be transmitted from donor to recipient. This concern arises from early problems with airway anastomoses, and dissemination from the lung. Due to advances in operative management, preservation, anti-microbial therapy and immunosuppression, the incidence of major airway dehiscence has declined along with reports of serious airway infection with Candida species. Although this was a recognized problem in the early history of lung transplantation, serious Candida infections have become uncommon, and donation should not be ruled out based on presence of Candida species alone. There are no convincing reports of Aspergillus transmission to recipients of solid organ transplants.",

One group addressed more directly the issue of risk of transmission when they assessed the likelihood of serum and liver tissue virus from liver biopsy patients.9 Their study showed that the risk of hepatitis B transmission from a core antibody-positive liver was small, and the risk of finding virus in the blood was negligible.",

There is no known therapy. Although little experience exists with transplantation of organs from donors with West Nile infection, it appears that the virus can be transmitted from an asymptomatic host to recipients, which happened with 4 patients last fall in the southeastern USA.81 With this in mind, it is prudent to avoid use of organs from patients potentially infected with the West Nile virus.",
