Intriguingly, not only COVID-19 but also SARS and MERS CoVs -all members of the Betacoronavirus genus -associate to an increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome. Already in patients with SARS-CoV, the development of respiratory failure was thought to be the consequence of a vigorous innate immune response, while effectiveness of tocilizumab in COVID-19 infected patients also supports the participation of a cytokine storm in severe phenotypes 1,2 . A factor underlying this explosive response could be the capacity of betacoronaviruses to invade immune-competent cells, particularly macrophages, thereby hijacking the major drivers of innate immune responses.",

            "text": "Betacoronaviruses replicate and carry out transcriptional activities at the cell cytosol, where the viral genome is detected by RIG-1 like receptor (RLR) helicases. Upon binding of vRNA, RLR activate mitochondrial antiviral proteins (MAVS). These in turn trigger phosphorylation of transcription factors and gene expression of interferons and cytokines, which are pivotal for an effective antiviral response 3 . Mitochondrial function is thus essential for the antiviral defense, while these organelles also need to provide for the increased energetic needs of infected cells. This fact points to mitochondrial failure as the mechanism unchaining severe forms of COVID-19 infection 4 . In brief, infected cells are exposed to an overload of nascent polypeptides, transcriptional machinery and by-products of helicases activation, altogether jeopardizing maintenance of protein folding and triggering cell and mitochondrial stress 5, 6 . In addition, COVID-19 genome polyadelnylation at J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the cytosol could waste adenine deposits and challenge mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Ultimately, mitochondrial proteostasis collapse would drive caspases activation and irreversible cell damage. According to available literature, calcineurin inhibitors could confer protection from these pathogenic processes. Briefly, these compounds help restore the unfoldedprotein response (UPR) at the cytosol, and may in this way rescue cells from necrosis 7 . In addition, upon targeting cyclophilin D, cyclosporin A inhibits MPTP opening, activates mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR) and prevents mitochondrial failure 8, 9 . Moreover, through this mechanism, cyclosporin A has shown cardioprotective effects in patients with myocardial infarction 10 . Finally, it should be emphasized that cyclosporin A has shown remarkable antiviral activities in a variety of RNA viruses, including the family of betacoronavirus, which employ cyclophilins as chaperones and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) as a major signaling pathway 12,13 .",
