            "text": "Nonequilibrium dynamic transitions driven by cascade dynamics on complex networks have attracted considerable attention recently [1\u20133]. The spreading of epidemic disease on complex networks [4\u201323] is an instance, in which a pathogen is transmitted from an infected node (e.g., a person) to a susceptible neighbor, who then becomes infected with a certain probability. If the transmission probability is sufficiently large (small), the pathogen spreads out to a macroscopic scale (remains local). An epidemic transition occurs between these two limits. The extent of spreading also depends on the structure of an underlying network [1,24]. When the degree distribution of a network is highly heterogeneous, diseases can spread out massively even for a small transmission probability, so that an epidemic transition point can be zero [25]. Information spreading in social media from one page to others may be modeled in a similar manner [5,6].",

            "text": "Among the several epidemic models, one of the simple contagion models is the so-called susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [26,27], in which each node has one of three states, susceptible (denoted as S), infected (I), or recovered (R). Initially, all the nodes are in state S except for one seed node in state I. The contagion process starts from a single node in state I. Each node in state I transmits pathogens to its neighbors in state S and infects each of them with probability \u03ba; then it changes its state to R with a unit probability. This contact process is repeated until the system reaches an absorbing state in which no infected node is left in the system. When the probability \u03ba is sufficiently small (large), the order parameter defined as the density of nodes in state R after the system falls into the absorbing state becomes o(N) [O(N)]; i.e., the system falls into a subcritical (supercritical) state. In between, an epidemic transition occurs at \u03bac, and the system exhibits critical behavior. It is known that when the dynamics starts from a single seed on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random networks [28], the SIR model undergoes a continuous percolation transition following the universal behavior of ordinary percolation.",

Accordingly, this model is called the SWIR model [7,20]. Nodes in state W are involved in the reactions S+I\u2192W+I and W+I\u21922I, which occur in addition to the reactions S+I\u21922I and I\u2192R in the SIR model. The properties of the epidemic transition in the SWIR model were extensively investigated for the single-seed case [7,10,15,20\u201322]. The order parameter, defined as the density of nodes in state R after an absorbing state is reached, displays a discontinuous transition, whereas other physical quantities such as the outbreak size distribution exhibit critical behaviors. Thus, the phase transition occurring in the SWIR model with a single seed is regarded as a mixed-order phase transition [22]. The dynamic rule of the SWIR model is so simple that its underlying mechanism for the discontinuous behavior of the order parameter was disclosed [30]. Moreover, the mechanism turned out to be universal in other models such as k-core percolation [31\u201334], the cascading failure model on interdependent networks [35\u201339], and epidemic-related models [5,6,8,10,12\u201314,16,17].",

We note that the number of multiple seeds was taken as O(N). On the contrary, in the single-seed case, such reactions rarely occur until the system reaches a characteristic dynamic step nc(N)\u223cN1/3: When dynamic step n is less than nc(N), the reactions S+I\u21922I and I\u2192R are dominant, but the number of nodes in R still remains as o(N). The contagion spreads in the form of a branching tree. When the dynamics reaches nc(N), the branching tree forms long-range loops due to finite-size effect. Once such loops form, the reaction W+I\u21922I occurs massively, in which the nodes in state W were generated in early time steps. Thus, the density of nodes in state R increases drastically as many as O(N) in short time steps. Due to these different contagion mechanisms, the properties of epidemic transitions in the multiple seed case become different from those in the single-seed case. We will determine the full set of critical exponents describing the phase transitions in the multiple seed case, and compare them with those obtained in the single-seed case [22].\n",

The m\u2212 value at \u03bac\u2212 is denoted as m0\u2212. We also define \u03bac+ and m0+ similarly to m+ in Eq. (16). We note that \u03bac+<\u03bac\u2212. Depending on the magnitude of the reaction probability \u03ba relative to \u03bac+ and \u03bac\u2212, the order parameter behaves differently, as follows:\n(1)For \u03ba<\u03bac+, there exists one stable solution m=md(\u03ba), which increases slowly with \u03ba. It is obtained that md\u2248\u03c10/(1\u2212\u03baz)+O(\u03c102).\n(2)At \u03ba=\u03bac+, there exist two solutions, md and m0+ (md<m0+). However, m0+ is not accessible because md is stable.(3)When \u03bac+<\u03ba<\u03bac\u2212, there exist three solutions, md, mm, and mu, with relative magnitudes md<mm<mu; however, the solution mm is unstable. Thus, only md is accessible from the initial density \u03c10<md. The order parameter behaves as m0\u2212\u2212md(\u03ba)\u223c(\u03bac\u2212\u2212\u03ba)1/2 for \u03ba<\u03bac\u2212.

Thus, the order parameter jumps between the two values, exhibiting discontinuous behavior.

A node in the state S can change its state to weakened (W) or infected (I) when it comes in contact with an infected node from the same or a different root. A weakened node can also change its state to infected (I) when it contacts an infected node from the same or a different root. The reaction probabilities \u03ba and \u03bc in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively, serve as control parameters. For convenience, we take \u03ba=\u03bc. We found that for a given network, there exists a critical density of seeds \u03c1c such that for \u03c10<\u03c1c, the order parameter, the density of nodes in state R in the absorbing state, increases continuously with the critical exponent \u03b2=1/2 as \u03ba is increased up to a transition point \u03bac\u2212 and then jumps to a finite value, followed by a continuous increase. Accordingly, the order parameter behaves as m(\u03ba)=m0\u2212\u2212b(\u03bac\u2212\u2212\u03ba)1/2 for \u03ba<\u03bac\u2212, where b is a positive constant. At \u03bac\u2212, the order parameter is discontinuous by \u0394m=mu(\u03bac\u2212)\u2212m0\u2212. Thus, the order parameter itself exhibits a hybrid phase transition. This pattern is different from that for the single-seed case, in which the order parameter jumps from m=0 to a finite value, and thus \u03b2=0. The fluctuation of the order parameter diverges at the transition point \u03bac\u2212 according to a power law with the exponent \u03b3. For the correlation size exponent \u03bd\u00af measured in finite systems, we find that the hyperscaling relation 2\u03b2+\u03b3=\u03bd\u00af holds reasonably well.",
