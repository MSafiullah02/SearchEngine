            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection caused severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction and had a higher crude fatality rate (around 50% vs 10%) than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. To understand the pathogenesis, we studied viral replication, cytokine/chemokine response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoV-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) versus SARS-CoV-infected MDMs. Only MERS-CoV can replicate in MDMs. Both viruses were unable to significantly stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines (interferon \u03b1 [IFN-\u03b1] and IFN-\u03b2) but induced comparable levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6. Notably, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher expression levels of interleukin 12, IFN-\u03b3, and chemokines (IP-10/CXCL-10, MCP-1/CCL-2, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, and interleukin 8) than SARS-CoV. The expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and costimulatory molecules were significantly higher in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs than in SARS-CoV-infected cells. MERS-CoV replication was validated by immunostaining of infected MDMs and ex vivo lung tissue. We conclusively showed that MERS-CoV can establish a productive infection in human macrophages. The aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines could be important in the disease pathogenesis.",

            "text": "In September 2012, a novel human coronavirus, HCoV-EMC, later renamed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in 2 patients with severe pneumonia complicated with renal failure who once traveled to or resided in Saudi Arabia [1, 2] . Retrospective analysis of archived specimens showed that the first virologically confirmed cases could be traced back to early April 2012 [3] . As of 1 August 2013, World Health Organization has confirmed 94 cases of infection with 46 deaths, and therefore an appalling fatality rate of around 50% [4] . Coronaviruses are the largest of all RNA viruses, with positive single-stranded RNA genomes of 26-32 kb. Many of them are globally distributed and detectable in a wide range of animals and humans [5] . They are classified into 4 genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus [6, 7] . HCoV-OC43 (lineage A betacoronavirus) and HCoV-229E (alphacoronavirus) are known causative agents of the common cold and rarely cause severe respiratory diseases [8, 9] . In contrast, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; lineage B betacoronavirus) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak during 2002-2003, affecting >8000 patients in >30 countries, with an overall fatality rate of 9.6% [10] [11] [12] [13] . The discovery of SARS-CoV aroused a growing recognition that human coronaviruses are potentially highly pathogenic. The heightened awareness sparked an intense hunting for novel coronaviruses, which led to the subsequent identification of HCoV-NL63 (alphacoronavirus) and HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A betacoronavirus), that occasionally cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients [14, 15] . Ten years after the SARS outbreak, another novel betacoronavirus of lineage C, MERS-CoV, might have jumped species barriers from bats to humans and caused an ongoing epidemic of severe human infections in the Middle East [6, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Most patients with MERS presented with rapidly progressive pneumonia. Many of them developed multiorgan dysfunction, deranged coagulation profile, and hematological changes, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia [3] . Although the clinical syndromes of MERS resembled those described in severe SARS, MERS often had renal failure and substantially surpassed SARS in terms of crude fatality rate. Because of the increasing number of person-to-person transmission in both nosocomial and community settings [21, 22] , there is a growing concern for another SARS-like pandemic.",

Recent studies demonstrated that, similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was capable of infecting and productively replicating in primary human airway epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues. Furthermore, MERS-CoV has a much broader tissue tropism than SARS-CoV and resembled SARS-CoV in its ability to suppress interferon production [26] [27] [28] [29] . The high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV prompted us to explore the potential host-virus interaction in macrophages, the cells that were implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS [24] . Therefore, we studied viral infection/replication, cellular immune response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoV-inoculated MDMs in comparison with SARS-CoV-inoculated MDMs. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS will be important for optimizing treatment strategies for this highly fatal emerging infectious disease.",

Our data demonstrated that MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, and IL-8 when compared with SARS-CoV ( MDMs in this study were in agreement with those in a previous report [35] . Collectively, we found that, similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV was unable to induce effective antiviral IFN response (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2). Both viruses similarly upregulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, but MERS-CoV induced more IFN-\u03b3 expression. Remarkably, MERS-CoV profoundly and sustainably induced immune cell-recruiting chemokines and cytokines, such as IP-10/CXCL-10, MCP-1/ CCL-2, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, IL-8, and IL-12, in MDMs. MERS-CoV modestly upregulated the expression of MHC class I-related molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, B2M, and PSMB8. As for MHC class II-related genes, MERS-CoV failed to induce the expression of HLA-DMB but upregulated the expression of HLA-DPB1 and CD74. Additionally, MERS-CoV significantly induced higher levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression than SARS-CoV ( Figure 6 ). In summary, our data suggested that MERS-CoV triggered the higher expression of MHC class I-, MHC class II-, and costimulation-related genes in MDMs than SARS-CoV.",

To this end, we performed the MERS-CoV inoculation in ex vivo culture of human lung tissue, where macrophages are abundant. We found that airway epithelial cells, predominantly pneumocytes and epithelial cells of terminal bronchioles, were infected, based on the cell and tissue morphology ( Figure 7A ). Moreover, intense immunoreactivity to MERS-CoV NP was observed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the interstitia ( Figure 7B ). We did not specifically define these NP-positive cells by costaining with epithelial cell-and endothelial cellspecific markers, because they were not the focus of this study. In stark contrast to a recent study [26] , we found that lung macrophages can be infected by MERS-CoV, as shown by the colocalization of MERS-CoV NP with CD68 ( Figure 7C and 7D) , although the fluorescence intensity of NP was stronger in respiratory epithelial cells than in macrophages. There was no colocalization of NP and CD68 in mock-infected tissues ( Figure 7E ). On the basis of these observations, we demonstrated that human lung macrophages were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection ex vivo.",

First, we found that the vascular endothelial cells in pulmonary interstitium and macrophages could be infected by MERS-CoV (Figure 7 ). This corroborated with the clinical observation that the virus was systemically disseminated in patients with MERS. A recent study described a patient with MERS who developed rapidly progressive pneumonia with respiratory failure, acute renal failure and septic shock, and eventually died [36] . The patient had high levels of viral RNA transcripts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patient's urine and stool samples also were positive for viral RNA. Despite a negative result for MERS-CoV in the blood sample of this patient, another study verified the presence of viral RNA transcripts in whole blood of a patient with MERS [21] . According to the gene expression profile in normal human tissue from public databases, DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor [37] , is abundantly expressed in a variety of human cells and tissues, which may facilitate the viral dissemination. Our previous study also provided strong evidence that cells derived from many human tissues can support MERS-CoV infection and replication [29] . Our present findings may provide the direct pathological basis for the systemic virus dissemination in MERS.",

Additionally, other proinflammatory cytokines also contributed to this chemoattractant cascade. This might lead to large number of immune cells infiltrating a patient's lower respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation and tissue damage. Clinically, most patients with MERS presented with rapidly progressive pneumonia with multilobar consolidations in radiographs and computed tomography scans. Cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid often showed high number of neutrophils and macrophages [2, 21] . MERS-CoV-inoculated rhesus macaques displayed milder respiratory symptoms than patients with MERS. But histopathological examination of lung tissue showed acute pneumonia with infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages [38] . We believe cytokine/chemokine induction may have been responsible for the infiltration by immune cells and substantially contributed to the severe pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in patients with MERS. Furthermore, most patients with MERS developed lymphopenia in the course of infection [2, 21, 22, 36] . This clinical manifestation was attributed to the immune cell recruitment and sequestration in the lower respiratory tract that was triggered by cytokine/chemokine induction. Additionally, we found that IP-10 and MCP-1, which can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells [39] , were highly induced upon MERS-CoV infection. The induction of these chemokines may inevitably aggravate the lymphopenia in patients with MERS. Taken together, our experimental findings are compatible with patient's clinical presentations and also elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of this life-threatening disease. We compared MERS-CoV with SARS-CoV in 3 aspects: viral replication, cytokine/chemokine production, and antigen presentation in MDMs. It has been well recognized that SARS-CoV infection in MDMs was abortive [35, 40] . Unlike the abortive infection of SARS-CoV in MDMs, MERS-CoV can establish a productive infection in MDMs (Figures 1 and 2) . The decreased viral titer in donors 1 and 3 at 72 hours after virus inoculation may have been due to excessive cell death over time. The infectivity of MERS-CoV to human macrophages was substantiated by the presence of viral NP in the macrophages of virus-inoculated ex vivo lung tissue (Figure 7) . Macrophages are among the first line of host defense against viral invasion. Efficient viral replication in these cells implicates that the virus can overcome the host defense and is highly virulent. The productive viral replication in macrophages may turn these phagocytes into viral reservoirs and vehicles for further replication and dissemination, as shown for human immunodeficiency virus [41] .",

However, direct infection of these immune cells by virus may cause dysregulated induction of these inflammatory mediators, which could be damaging to neighboring tissues. Among these proinflammatory mediators, aberrant induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 is almost a hallmark of severe respiratory viral infection, such as SARS and human infection by avian influenza viruses [34, 42] . The immunostimulatory effects of IFN-\u03b3 outweighed its antiviral effects in SARS [33] . IL-12 functions to stimulate the growth and activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines in these cells. MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and IP-10 are notable for their strong chemoattraction of monocytes/macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and acute inflammatory cells to the site of infection. Apart from its chemotactic effect for granulocytes and T cells, RANTES can also promote T-cell and NK-cell activation. IL-8 shows strong chemotaxis for neutrophils and other granulocytes. It is also a potent inducer for other chemokines. A number of studies indicated that antiviral IFNs and cytokines were not induced in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells [35, 43, 44] , possibly because SARS-CoV evolved strategies to antagonize the innate responses [45] . In contrast, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, and MCP-1) were upregulated [35, 43] . A plethora of clinical studies reported that levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, and IP-10, were highly elevated in patients with SARS, some of which were correlated with disease severity or mortality [33, 34] . Additionally, macrophages in the patient's lung tissue were believed to be the producer of cytokine storm and underlie the pathogenesis of SARS [24] . We compared and found that many of the cytokines/chemokines in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs shared a similar expression profile to SARS-CoV-infected cells. Notably, immune cell-recruiting chemokines and immunostimulating cytokines were induced at a significantly higher magnitude and prolonged interval by MERS-CoV, compared with SARS-CoV. Therefore, it is conceivable that immunopathogenesis, which is operative in SARS [46] , may be aggravated in MERS, causing more severe disease and higher fatality. The detailed expression profile of the cytokine/chemokine responses in MERS-CoV-infected and SARS-CoV-infected MDMs should be investigated with microarray analysis.",

This contrasts with a recent report showing a decreased antigen-presentation profile in a MERS-CoV-infected lung cancer cell line [47] . The disagreement is possibly attributable to differences in the properties of MDMs and the lung cancer cell line. The full scenario of antigen presentation in MERS definitely warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, based on our results, the increase in antigen presentation in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs may potentially contribute to exaggerate the immunopathology.",

On the other hand, macrophages present viral antigens, coupled with MHC class II molecules, to helper T cells and B cells to elicit the cellular and humoral immune responses. The effective host immune response is an important determinant for disease presentation and outcome of viral infection. A number of molecules for antigen processing (PSMB8 and CD74), antigen expression and stability in MHC class I complex (B2M), and costimulation and activation (CD40, CD80, and CD86), together with MHC class I (HLA-A and HLA-B) and MHC class II (HLA-DMB and HLA-DPB1) molecules, were examined upon inoculation with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or mock control.
