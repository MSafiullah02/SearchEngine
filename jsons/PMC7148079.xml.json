            "text": "Drugs and diseases play a central role in many areas of biomedical research and healthcare. A large part of the biomedical research has focused on scientific abstracts in English; see a good overview of the field in [9]. In contrast to the biomedical literature, research into the processing of electronic health records (EHRs) and user-generated texts (UGTs) about drug therapy has not reached the same level of maturity. The bottleneck of modern supervised models for named entity recognition (NER) is the human effort needed to annotate sufficient training examples for each language or domain. Moreover, state of the art text processing models may perform extremely poorly under domain shift [14]. Recent advances in neural networks, especially deep contextualized word representations via language models [1, 4, 12, 16] and Transformer-based architectures [19], offer new opportunities to improve NER models in the biomedical field.",

Our goal is not to outperform state of the art models on each dataset separately, but to ask whether we can transfer knowledge from a high-resource language, such as English, to a low-resource one, e.g., Russian, for NER of biomedical entities. Our transfer learning strategy involves pretraining the multilingual cased BERT [4] on one corpus and transferring the learned weights to initialize training on a gold-standard corpus in another language or domain. In this work, we seek to answer the following research questions: RQ1: How well does a BERT-based NER model trained on one corpus works for the detection of drugs and diseases from another language or domain in the zero-shot setting? RQ2: Given a small number of training examples, can the NER model perform as well as a model trained on much larger datasets? RQ3: Will transfer learning help achieve more stable performance on a varying size of training data?",

To answer RQ2 and RQ3, we begin with a random sampling of 50 sentences from a \u201ctarget\u201d training set, train the pretrained model on this subsampled dataset, and test it on the \u201ctarget\u201d test set. Next, we increase the sample size by 50 sentences of the \u201ctarget\u201d training set and repeat the described procedure, doing so up to 2000 sentences of the training set.

Multi-BERT pretrained on the EN UGT set and trained on 2000 sentences from the EN EHR corpus (2.81% of the full corpus) obtains 92% F1 and 76% F1 of the full dataset performance on drugs and diseases respectively. As shown in Table 5 and Fig. 1, models with transfer knowledge outperform the models without the pretraining phase even in cases when both domain and language shifts between \u201csource\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d sets. Using the transfer learning strategy could require up to 550 sentences less than training from scratch. In particular, models require only 10% and 23% of the EN UGT and RU URT corpora respectively to achieve results as good as full dataset performances. We believe that this observation is very crucial for low resource languages and new domains (e.g., social media, clinical trials). We observe that the performance of models with pretraining setup trained on the different numbers of sentences becomes more stable in terms of deviations between F1-scores (see Fig. 1).\n",

We ask: can additional pretraining on an existing dataset be helpful for bioNER performance of multilingual BERT-based NER model on a new dataset with a small number of labeled examples if the domain, the language, or both shift between these datasets? Our study consisted of over 720 models trained on different subsets of two corpora in English and two corpora in Russian. For each language, we experimented with the clinical domain, i.e., electronic health records, and the social media domain, i.e., reviews about drug therapy. As expected, models with pretraining on data in the same language or the same domain obtain better results in zero-shot or few-shot settings. To our surprise, we found that pretraining on data with two shifts can be effective. The model with the best pretraining achieves 99% of the full dataset performance using only 23.56% of the training data on our RU URT corpus, while the model with pretraining on data with two shifts (the EN EHR set) used 26.1% of the training data. The model without pretraining achieves similar results on the RU URT corpus using 31.97% of the training set.",
