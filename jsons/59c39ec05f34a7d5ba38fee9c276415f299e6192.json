In this paper, we introduce the basic models of networks used to describe the social contacts within a population. Then we study how to transfer the traditional epidemic models, based on the ''homogeneous mixing'' assumption, to the new framework. We will see that, moving from the classical to the network modelling approach, results become more complex and somehow unexpected, as the structure of the social network plays a fundamental role.",

Clearly, this is the kind of social network we are interested in, to understand and model the processes involved in epidemics, most of which spread by contact between individuals: some by simple proximity (for instance, sneezing or shaking hands can transmit flu or measles), other ones by less casual contacts (as in sexually transmitted diseases, or the spread of hepatitis or HIV through infected material).",

The first significant use of a mathematical model dates back to 1927, when Kermack and McKendrick suggested a system of differential equations in order to explain the evolution data of a plague epidemic in India [7] . Their crucial assumption lay in describing the population as a kind of perfectly mixed gas, in which every individual is equivalent to every other and has, in a fixed time interval, the same probability of meeting any other individual. It is through the meeting of a healthy and not immune individual (called susceptible, S) and of an infected one (called infective, I) that the infection can be transmitted, with a probability depending on the epidemic's virulence: the susceptible person becomes infected.",

We may deduce that the number of infected people grows with b, as we could have guessed, but, more importantly, that there exists a threshold value b cr under which the epidemic is bound to die out. Indeed, if b is too small, the few infected people in the population are not able to generate a sufficient number of other infected individuals, due to the scarcity of contacts or the low virulence of the pathogen. The existence of this threshold has always been one of the cornerstones of epidemiological modelling [1] .",

The SIS model sketched above does not take spatial factors into account, since it imagines the population to be confined in a ''container'', where it is perfectly mixed. If we want to describe the spread of the epidemic in a region, we have to derive a partial differential equation model in the variable y(t, x), where x is the spatial variable. The simplest and most intuitive generalisations of the SIS model assume a diffusive term, which means that an epidemic originating at a point expands with a wavefront covering ever larger areas. This is a phenomenon that has been observed very often in the past. Figure 3 shows as an example the Black Death epidemic that had decimated Europe by the middle of the fourteenth century: having appeared in Sicily in 1347, the epidemic gradually spread northwards, covering the whole of Europe within 3 years. The spreading was conveyed by the slow and not so numerous journeys by travellers and merchants between adjacent villages and cities.",

The epidemic originated in the Far East (Hong Kong), but within a few weeks important centres of infections appeared in several cities around the world, especially those harbouring significant Chinese communities. The process of spreading was twofold. On one hand, just like the case discussed above, it was of a ''local'' kind: the network of social relations mainly includes people who are nearby (relatives, coworkers, friends and so on) with whom contacts are frequent. This was the earlier mechanism of spreading, and indeed, it caused a very high incidence of the disease in crowded Hong Kong and its environs. But this was followed by a long-range spreading carried by air transport, in this case toward the main emigration areas. In addition to local contacts, which are often abundant and frequent, many individual also have ''remote'' contacts, typically few and uncommon, but on the whole sufficient to spread the epidemic far away in a very short time. This is a process which was clearly impossible not just at the time of the Black Death, but even a few decades ago, and which cannot be possibly described by the conventional diffusive models, but requires network models instead.

This is a situation that never occurs in real-life networks, but it is however possible to find examples of almost homogeneous networks, that is, in which the node degrees never lie too far from the average value m. An important example is given by the so-called Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks: having fixed N and L (and hence the average degree m = 2L/N), the network is constructed by assigning links to L pairs of nodes selected randomly among the N(N -1)/2 possible ones. For sufficiently large N and L (formally: for N ? ? with m fixed), we can prove that P(k) converges to a Poisson distribution with mean m: what this means is that most nodes have a degree not far from m which can so be taken as a representative value (or ''typical scale'') of the degree of the nodes. So, in terms of social networks, an Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi network represents a community of individuals in which everybody has approximately the same number of acquaintances (Fig. 5 ).",

Such examples have been found almost everywhere, from biology to the WWW, from transport to trade networks, to mention just a few instances. In a social network, this means that in the population there are individuals who, due to their kind of activities, are in touch with a very large number of people. Alongside these individuals, there are others who, at the opposite end of the distribution, have just a few contacts.

The crucial ingredient of the algorithm lies in selecting these nodes, which are picked up randomly by assigning to each node a probability of being selected proportional to its current degree k i . In other words, the new node will tend to connect to nodes that are already well connected, with an effect of positive feedback that, in the end, is what is actually responsible for the creation of hubs. Adding more and more nodes (and hence for N ? ?), the degree distribution converges toward a power law of the form P(k) * k -3 . It is important to remark that such a distribution has a divergent variance, that is, r 2 = P k (km) 2 P(k) ? ? when N ? ?. This property does not hold for real-life networks with a finite N.

In the context of social networks, this property was first highlighted in the 1960s by the now famous experiment by Milgram [9] , which gave rise to the ''theory'' of the ''six degrees of separation'', now fully a part of popular culture. According to this theory, in the social network consisting of all the inhabitants of the Earth (in which N equals some billion), the distance between two arbitrary individuals is on the average six. In other words, assuming two individuals to be linked if they are related by kinship, friendship etc., it would be possible to connect any two human beings by a chain consisting on the average of six links. While this belief is based on extrapolating from experiments performed on a far smaller scale, there is reason to believe that the actual average distance d is not much larger, and in any case several orders of magnitude smaller than N. A network with this property is called a small-world network. More precisely, if we consider a set of networks parametrised by N, we say that the set has the small-world property if d grows as log N, and hence far slower than N.",

The experiment works as follows: we start with a network with a regular geometry, that is, in which all connections are of ''local'' type; then we randomly select a (small) proportion 0 \\ p \\ 1 of the links, for each of these we disconnect one randomly chosen endpoint, and reconnect it to a node again chosen at random (''rewiring''). As the diagram in Fig. 7 shows, a value as small as p = 0.001 (that is, just one thousandth of the links is rewired) is sufficient to halve the average distance d, while p = 0.01 reduces it to 20 % of the original value. It can be shown that, while d * N in the regular network, we have d * log N in the rewired one. So, long-distance connections turn a regular network into a small-world one and, in the case of epidemic spreading, they allow a rapid transmission of the contagion in all areas of the network: this is what happened for the SARS epidemic mentioned earlier. 3 Epidemic spreading in a network",

The most direct and effective class of models exploitable to this end is that of probabilistic cellular automata. In their simplest version, these are discrete-time models, that is, models in which the events happen at times t = 0, D, 2D, \u2026, having chosen D as our discretisation interval. At time t, each node i is in a state x i t belonging to a finite set P = {0, 1, \u2026, q -1}, typically of a small cardinality q. At time t ? D, the node i will change to a state x i t\u00feD depending, according to probabilistic rules to be specified, on x i t but also on the state of the nodes directly linked to i (the so-called ''neighbours'' of i). The cellular automaton is completely defined when we have specified the network, giving its adjacency matrix A, and the interaction rules among adjacent nodes. Having fixed the initial state x i 0 for all the nodes and allowing the system to evolve, what we obtain is a realization of a stochastic process, since the interaction rules are probabilistic. The first question we might ask is rather obvious: what properties are common to all possible instances? This means we are asking whether the epidemic is able to spread or not, and in the former case, which global value it may reach, which nodes are most frequently hit, and so on. The second question is subtler: does the answer to the first question depend on the topological properties of the network? We are asking, in other words, whether the structural features of the network (the degree distribution, for instance) play a role in the result of the spreading process.",

S, assume that if the node i is infected at time t, then with probability cD it will be healthy (so susceptible again) at time t ? D, while it will stay infected with probability (1 -cD). As for the infection process S ?

This rule set can be easily transferred to instructions in a programming environment (Matlab, for instance): having defined the network by its adjacency matrix, it is possible to run several simulations and to analyse the results in several ways. However, we want to know if it is possible to get an aggregate description, possibly up to some approximation, of the results we might expect from those simulations: this means to write a mean field model for a process intrinsically distributed.

Now, if the degree distribution is (almost) homogeneous, we can assume that every node has m neighbours (the average degree); moreover, by ignoring possible spatial inhomogeneities, we may assume that a proportion of these neighbours equal to y(t) = Y(y)/N is infected, that is, a proportion equal to that for the whole network.

By comparing the two formulas, we notice that b = qm: the derivation through the network model makes it clear that the transmission coefficient b consists of two factors: the first one (q) purely biological and representative of the pathogen's virulence, the second one (m) related to the structure of the social network.

In other words, the higher the values we take in account for the degree k, the fewer the nodes we will find (P(k) ? 0), but the higher will be the probability that they be infected (y k ? 1). This is the process underlying a contagion within a heterogeneous network: once the epidemic is in the network, the hubs, due to their extremely high number of connections, have a high probability of getting infected. In a way, they are the ''watchmen'' of the epidemic, which is thus able to avoid extinction and survive, even if at low levels. Indeed, this is the scenario observed in some kinds of disease [10] as well as, turning to technology, the typical pattern in the spreading and persistence of computer viruses in the Internet [14] . The example we have studied here, while relatively simple, is sufficient to stress how, in going from ''classical'' to ''network'' models, we can find unexpected and, in any case, more complex and elaborate results. In the last 10 years, research has extended in countless directions, and in the near future will continue to extend even farther. As for epidemics, models more complex than a simple SIS process have been used, as we might easily imagine, in order to describe different features of the many kinds of existing diseases. Regarding social networks, it is apparent that a ''static'' description such as the one given here, that is, one in which the individuals are fixed and each of them maintains the same contacts forever, is overly simplified. More realistic descriptions are bound to include the processes of birth and death of individuals (with the associated linking/unlinking of connections), their mobility (a network variable in time) or, in the most complex case, the reciprocal interaction between epidemics and topology: links vary in time as a function of the epidemiological state of the involved individuals (adaptive networks). All these extensions, as it is easy to understand, make studying networks more and more difficult and complex. However, it is an effort well worth making: on the whole, infectious diseases cause more than 15 million deaths worldwide every year (25 % of all deaths [10] ). Let us hope that the joint study of epidemics and networks through mathematical models will help to lower this tragic toll.",
