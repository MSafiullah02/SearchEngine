            "text": "The media has a fascination with disastrous events, influencing and inflating public anxiety and perceptions of danger (Borum et al. 2010). When events such as school or college shootings occur, public fear is heightened due to the fact that schools are portrayed as a safe place for children (Lindle 2008). Like the general public, teachers hear about school shootings occurring, exacerbating their existing fear of violence against children. Similarly, wild/ forest fires that have potential to engulf communities and explosions caused by various reasons with a potential to hurt communities receive much and prolonged attention by the media. People are generally fearful of fires due to their destructive nature and stomach turning reaction to burn injuries or death. They provoke extreme passion in people\u2019s minds. There are also advantages to media attention in that it creates awareness, emotional engagement, and encourages donations and other forms of help by local, national, and international community. A recent example of a forest fire is Fort McMurray, Alberta fires in May 2016. Being an oil patch of Canadian Midwest, the community sits on the fringes of natural forest creating an easy access for a forest fire to spread to the community. This phenomenon is known as interface fire which is becoming far more common due to various reasons. The soaring 32 \u00b0C temperatures fueled the fire and tinder dry forest fire swept through the community destroying homes and buildings and forcing the largest wildfire evacuation in Albertan history. It continued to spread across northern Alberta and into Saskatchewan, consuming forested areas and impacting Athabasca oil sands operations until mid-June when rain helped firefighters to hold the fire (Ramsay and Shum 2016; Parsons and Graney 2016). It has become the costliest disaster in Canadian history. The fire destroyed 2400 structures, nearly 10% of the city, and forced more than 80,000 residents to flee. As a risk mitigation effort, Alberta instituted a province wide ban on open fires, including campfires and the use of charcoal briquettes (Globe and Mail 2016). Figure 5.4 shows the raging fire and fleeing residents and Fig. 5.5 illustrates the extent of loss in Fort McMurray.",

Many times, vulnerable people living in hazard-prone areas do not perceive their exposure to risk concerning enough to becoming their top priority (Nirupama 2015) as basic necessities of life remains their main focus. Perception about people\u2019s behaviour during emergencies defines, to a large extent, how authorities would plan resource allocation for community emergency response as well as develop and implement mitigation measures. During the past decade, a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management has been apparent and community participation is being encouraged by policy makers. It is believed that community participation, not a top-down approach, will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people\u2019s perception regarding hazard risk, vulnerability, and resilience. Experts (Wisner et al. 2004; Ferrier and Haque 2003; Twigg 2007; UNISDR 2001) have also delved in explaining the progression of people\u2019s vulnerability by employing various arguments given the social, physical, and political environments. Birkmann (2006) has developed indicators for identifying and assessing vulnerability. Emphasis on assessing people\u2019s vulnerability and potential risks they may be exposed to, in order to mitigate losses through knowledge based actions, is clearly noticeable (Cutter 2012; ICSU 2008; Pelling 2003; Jaeger et al. 2001; Tobin and Montz 1997) preference as a way to go forward.",

The participant women in the group were regular members of the Centre, using the resource because they were vulnerable in more than one way. They were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, low income group, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants (Fig. 5.10), but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threats \u2013 indicating a lack of awareness and engagement with their surroundings.

This research is based on the premise set by the REM survey to further explore people\u2019s knowledge, preferences, interests, priorities, and perceptions in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in the society. A questionnaire based survey was used to collect data from three different community locations in the City of Brampton , namely, South Fletcher\u2019s Sportsplex community centre, New Birth Tabernacle (a local non-denominational faith centre), and a local restaurant (MJ\u2019S BBQ & Suya).

What is surprising is that so many preferred a command and control approach during the mitigation and prevention phases; in the personal experience of the authors emergency managers often prefer community engagement in this part of the cycle. One of the most notable features of Fig. 5.18 is a large variance in terms of how the respondents viewed command-and-control versus community-based approaches. Recent academic literature has emphasized problems with top-down management structures and emphasized the importance of including community involvement (e.g. Mileti 1999; Canton 2007). In part this may reflect a tendency for emergency managers to come from military or first responder backgrounds, where this approach works well and is the basis for much of their training and work.",
