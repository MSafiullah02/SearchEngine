Decisions regarding the expected death of a child, like end of life care plan, hospital- or home-based care, are often taken into isolation by care givers and are seldom discussed with the child [1]. Pattern of end of life palliation opted by family has a variable spectrum. A study from Germany noted that 40% of advanced cancer cases opted for chemotherapy-based palliation, but majority regretted it in hindsight. While 80% of families, who opted for home-based terminal care, were satisfied with their decision retrospectively, as many as one-third of the families are not open to discussing the end of life care (EOLC) plan in detail with the treating team [2]. Even when explained about in-curability, parental perception and hope are often unrealistic [3]. Study from India noted that parents welcomed detailed information regarding EOLC care plan and support of hospital care as well as social services for home-based care. Studies have elaborated the symptoms encountered by the dying child as loneliness, fear of death, irritability and dullness. Despite interventions, satisfactory control was seldom achieved [4, 5].",

The pattern of choice of palliation is probably different in such population. Knowledge about preferences will guide us to tailor palliation plan accordingly.

One parent of the child was interviewed and decision to enrol mother or father was entirely of family.

None of the families consulted the child for his or her choice regarding the place of EOLC plan. A total of 12 (46%) families regretted their choice of EOLC plan in retrospect. This retrospective regret was more common with families opting hospital as EOLC place (P = 0.03) and also in families with self-financed treatment (P = 0.179) (Tables 5). Pain was noted to be significantly more observed symptoms in the home-based EOLC group (P = 0.020) and respiratory distress was the most bothersome symptom among the admitted group (Table 6). Admitted children had easy access to medicinal remedies for their symptoms and 54% parent expressed their perception as near satisfactory for the control of symptoms temporarily. The hospital-based EOLC group regretted its decision with reasons\u2014uncontrolled pain, fearfulness of child regarding the hospital environment and child\u2019s unfulfilled desire to be at home. The home-based EOLC group regretted its decision with reasons\u2014uncontrolled pain and non-availability of medical help at home (Table 7). Only 3 patients that opted for home-based EOLC were visited by health care worker during terminal care. On univariate analysis using the Pearson chi-square test, only living in a rental house was significantly associated with the choice of home-based EOLC (Table 8).",

Surveys showed that majority of paediatric cancer patients were sub-optimally treated with either adult medical oncologist or self-trained paediatricians. Even separate beds or wards for paediatric oncology were not available in many medical colleges and hospitals [7, 8]. Resource allocation in such a large country has severe imbalance. While centres in metropolitan cities have specialised paediatric oncology services and collaborative trials have started, rural India lacks the basic diagnostic facilities for such ailments and under reporting of cancers is common. Only 5% of the population has been covered by national registry in 2005 [9, 10].

EOLC is needed in about 675,000 cancer cases and 25% of diagnosed paediatric cancer cases [11, 12]. Approach for care at time of impending death and beyond leads to the concept of end of life palliative care. By the 1980s, this concept got attention in developed and developing world with people expecting a good quality of life even when death is anticipated [13\u201315]. India which hosts about one million of the cancer population is severely lacking in all aspects of palliative care and capacity building for it as well [16]. Paediatric palliative care need is different, as a child is not the decision-maker in majority of cases. His expression of symptoms and fear may not be adequately perceived or addressed by the care givers. With the passing of time, his preferences and expectation might change and a hospital-based care might be more dreadful for him.

However, temporary relief with medication was noted in a significant proportion of admitted patients, 3/7 participants still regretted the decision of opting hospital as terminal care site and majority were concerned with the restrictive atmosphere, non-segregation, lack of privacy and fear of death in child due to frequent medical and nursing interventions. The 2 families, who opted for ICU care and resuscitation, regretted it later as ventilation and sedation caused separation from their child at the terminal time. Regret was less among home-based EOLC-based parents and mainly limited to unavailability of medical aids for symptom relief. Intensive care supports for terminally ill oncological patients are not uniformly promoted. Lack of consensus among medical fraternity in India has been noted regarding ICU care, ventilator support, withdrawal and policy of no escalation of advanced life support treatment in such cases [19].",

The common concept of Karma responsible for all sufferings and sufferings are purging for old sins are accepted by almost all religions. While extensive use of pain-alleviating medications is not accepted in Islam and Jainism, these decisions do changes with the paediatric population [20, 21]. Social structure like combined family and availability of many relatives to visit during terminal days are common. A western model of opting hospice is not regularly cherished in Indian society. However, unavailability of community-based EOLC support and non-existent home care assistance lead to regret by family [22].",

In India, availability of morphine to a home-based terminal care patient is almost non-existent. Data regarding supply of morphine showed dismal figure [23, 24]. Community-based palliative care facility is also not available in majority of the states. Kerala, a state in India, established a model primary level palliative care with community participation. This was applauded by the WHO and World Palliative Care Alliance but unfortunately is not being followed by other states of the country [25]. Home-based palliation is often remembered as the terminal period without medical intervention by parents in this study [26].",

Financial status emerged as a cause for opting home-based care; thus, social acceptance across all the economic strata could not be commented.
