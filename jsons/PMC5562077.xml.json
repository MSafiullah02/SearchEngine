            "text": "Laryngeal cancer consists mostly of squamous cell carcinomas (also known as the larynx or laryngeal carcinoma), indicating their origin from human skin of larynx (1,2). According to GLOBOCAN 2012, there were an estimated 156,877 new cases and 83,376 deaths in the world, and the adjusted incidence and mortality rates were 2.1/100,000 and 1.1/100,000, respectively (3). Cancer could develop in any part of the larynx according to a previous study. However, the cure rate presently is influenced by the tumor location (4). The origin of laryngeal cancer is a specialised area, which needs the coordinated expertise of ear, nose and throat surgeons and oncologists (5,6). The laryngeal cancer symptoms rely on the tumor size and location. Specific treatment has a close relationship with the type, location, as well as the stage of laryngeal cancer (7,8). Treatment includes radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy, alone or in combination. However, a patient affected severely may need a laryngectomy, the total or the partial remove of the vocal cords. In 2013, data indicated that laryngeal cancer has led to a large number of deaths since 1990 (9). Furthermore, the survival rate of patients with laryngeal cancer has decreased compared with the survival rate of patients with all other types of cancers as a whole (4). Hence, finding effective and safe therapeutic strategy is urgenyly needed to improve cancer treatments. It has been indicated that the treatment of a variety of drugs targeting different signaling pathways can provide effective strategy for various cancer cell mutations, and postpone cancer adaptation procedure subsequently.",

As a potential scavenger of free radicals, including singlet oxygen and superoxide anion, galangin has various bioactivities and influences many cellular processes (12). In addition to its anti-mutagenic, anti-oxidant, as well as anti-inflammatory functions, galangin has been reported to possess antitumor role in a number of in vitro and in vivo systems, including melanoma, hepatoma and leukaemia (13,14). Furthermore, a previous study suggested that galangin possesses therapeutic potential as an antitumor agent for liver cancer (15). Galangin induced apoptosis by suppressing tumor cell migration, promoting caspase-3 and increasing ROS production (16). However, the effect of galangin on human laryngeal cancer progression has not been investigated yet. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of galangin on two types of human laryngeal cancer cells.",

Caspase-9 was activated with the elevated level of cleaved caspase-9, which in turn cleaved caspase-3 and ultimately induced apoptosis (17,18). Autophagy is a cellular process of catabolic degradation in which damaged, dysfunctional, or superfluous organelles and proteins are sequestered, engulfed, and recycled to maintain cellular metabolism, viability and homeostasis (19,20). The mTOR kinase, which is activated by signaling pathway originating from growth factors, plays a critical role in regulating autophagy progression (21). There are diverse signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of mTOR signaling, including positive regulation of mTOR (PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling) suppressing autophagy (22,23). The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is implicated in cell migration and invasion, which induces the expression of NF-\u03baB transcription factor, resulting in cancer cell proliferation (24).",

The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control (Con) group, the galangin group (10 mg/kg), the galangin group (20 mg/kg) and the galangin group (30 mg/kg). Subsequently, 150 \u00b5l of the TU212 cell suspension (containing 2\u00d7107 cells) was injected subcutaneously into the right axilla area of the mice. Ten days before the cancer cell inoculation, the treatment groups were gavaged with galangin every day and observed for the growth of tumors at 42 days. The control mice were only injected with the equal volume of TU212 cells. The growth of tumors were determined after the mice were sacrificed, and stored for the following experiments.",

Additionally, after the TU212 cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M galangin for different time as indicated, we found that the cell viability was reduced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in human laryngeal carcinoma HEP-2 cells, the cell viability was decreased with the upregulation of galangin concentrations, especially at >10 \u00b5M (Fig. 1D). Also, HEP-2 cell viability was decreased by 10 \u00b5M galangin administration for different times. In addition, significant difference was observed for over 24 h (Fig. 1E). Finally, M4e cells were also included to confirm the suppressive role of galangin in human laryngeal carcinoma. From Fig. 1F, shows that the M4e cell viability was downregulated for galangin treatment, which was comparable to the Con ones at >20 \u00b5M. Similarly, the cell viability was lower by 10 \u00b5M galangin treatment for different times (Fig. 1G).

In apoptosis process, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is known as a \u2018point-of-no-return\u2019 and is closely regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins, especially Bax activation (25). Galangin apparently promoted Bax protein expresssion and pre-treatment with galangin significantly suppressed Bcl-2 protein levels (Fig. 5D-F). The results from western blot analysis showed that galangin enhanced activation of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, resulting in increased PARP cleavage in TU212 (Fig. 5D and E) and HEP-2 cells (Fig. 5D and F). Furthermore, Bax activation was confirmed to be increased for galangin treatment in TU212 (Fig. 5G and H) and HEP-2 cells (Fig. 5G and I).

Also, immunofluorescent analysis was performed to explore TSC1 levels in both TU212 (Fig. 8D and E) and HEP-2 (Fig. 8D and F) cells.

Patients suffering from laryngeal cancer show a poor survival rate with poor advance during the last decades (33). Thus, more effective treatments are needed to be explored for preventing laryngeal cancer. Natural compounds show an essential role in cancer and other disease prevention and treatment worldwide (4). Galangin is known as an anti-tumor agent, which is effective in preventing a broad range of tumors, such as liver, breast, as well as lung cancer (14\u201316,34). Galangin has been reported to perform its role in inhibiting tumor growth through apoptosis regulation (35). However, whether galangin could be a potential compound for human laryngeal cancer prevention is not known. Thus, galangin was used here to provide possible therapeutic strategy for suppressing human laryngeal cancer. Notably, it is the first study to explore the molecular mechanisms of galangin-triggered human laryngeal cancer cell death. In our study, we found that exposure of galangin into TU212 and HEP-2 cells could partially suppress cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Autophagy is a regulated process of degradation and recycling of cellular constituents; the process is important in organelle turnover and the bioenergetics management of starvation (36). During autophagy, the precursor form of LC3 is post-modified into LC3-I and LC3-II (37,38). LC3-I is localized in the cytosol, and LC3-II is a membrane-associated and a key hallmark for autophagosome formation (39). LC3-II can be used to estimate the abundance of autophagosomes before they are destroyed through fusion with lysosomes (40). Here, augmented LC3II was found after galangin treatment, indicating that the autophagy was induced. Obviously in in vivo study, the tumor size and weight was reduced for galangin administration. The results suggested that galangin has potential, to be developed as a therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal carcinoma.",

Enhanced activation of PI3K/AKT pathway is linked to the development and progression of many cancers, as well as resistance to chemotherapy (42). A previous study reported that inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is involved in the success of chemotherapy-caused apoptosis in some cancer cells (43,44). In the present study, PI3K was reduced in galangin treatment, subsequently downregulating the protein levels of phosphorylated AKT, being in line with previous results, indicating that galangin might perform its role in suppressing human laryngeal carcinoma through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inactivation. Apoptosis constitutes a fundamental intrinsic mechanism of tumor suppression, as the resistance of apoptosis is a well-established hallmark of cancer (45,46). It is known that Bcl-2 protein is also a key regulator for apoptosis and its tumorigenic potential is supported by the finding of overexpression of Bcl-2 in various types of tumor, which is related to the activation of AKT (47). AKT is a key player in regulating cell signals that are important for cell death and survival. Activation of the AKT pathway promotes cell survival and is involved in the upregulation of Bcl-2 (48,49). In this study, we found that with the altered trend of AKT expressed levels, Bcl-2 was reduced in galangin treatment. The caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were highly improved, contributing to the death of TU212 and HEP-2 cells and leading to cell apoptosis and cell death due to galangin tretament. The results above suggested that galangin suppressed human laryngeal cancer development and progression through apoptosis induction.",

NF-\u03baB in different tumors or cancers is modulated by PI3K/AKT pathway (52). P-AKT activates I\u03baB kinase (IKK\u03b1), leading to inhibition of NF-\u03baB degradation by I\u03baB, allowing NF-\u03baB to be transferred into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, where it activates its target genes and promotes cell survival (53). In this study, NF-\u03baB was markedly activated accompanied by AKT phosphorylation in the absence of galangin treatment. However, galangin administration downregulated NF-\u03baB phosphorylated activity, leading to the upregulation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, indicating that galangin could inhibit human laryngeal cancer via AKT-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In addition, PI3K/AKT pathway is of great importance for the cell proliferation. One of the best-known downstream substrates of PI3K/AKT is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inducing mammalian autophagy significantly, regulating protein translation (54). Previously it was indicated that the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signal pathway may be involved in autophagy suppression (55). Impeding PI3K-AKT-mTOR signal pathway has been indicated to be effective for various cancers treatment (56,57). In our investigation, here the phosphorylated mTOR in high expression was suppressed in TU212 and HEP-2 cells for galangin administration, and in contrast, TSC1, an inhibitor of mTOR, was upregulated for galangin. The results illustrated that galangin prevented human laryngeal cancer through inhibiting laryngeal cancer cells proliferation and inducing autophagy via PI3K/AKT-regulated mTOR activity.",
