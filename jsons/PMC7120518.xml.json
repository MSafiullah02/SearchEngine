            "text": "Seminal studies by Rosen et al. in 1985 designated a region at the immediate 5\u2032 terminus of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome the trans-acting response, or TAR element. This cis-acting motif, in conjunction with the viral trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein, significantly enhanced transcription of the HIV-1 genome via modification of the transcription complex (Karn 1999; Peterlin and Price 2006). Shortly thereafter, a second HIV accessory protein, the regulator of expression of virion proteins (Rev) whose interaction with another cis-acting RNA (the Rev responsive element or RRE) regulated nucleocytoplasmic export of full-length and singly-spliced viral RNAs was reported (Feinberg et al. 1986). Surprisingly, more than 25 years after the crucial contribution of the Tat/TAR and Rev/RRE axes to HIV-1 replication was demonstrated, these RNAs, the viral and host proteins with which they interact, and the resulting nucleoprotein complexes have not proven therapeutically accessible, based primarily on a lack of selectivity of small molecules and inefficient delivery of larger therapeutic oligonucleotides. The discovery of numerous new classes of RNAs and their function in a variety of biological processes has revolutionized molecular biology, which undoubtedly will have profound implications for clinical sciences. The application of \u201c macromolecule therapeutics\u201d in other fields, while still their in fledgling stage, is exemplified by:\nSplice-Switching Oligonucleotides (SSOs). Alternative splicing enables a single pre-messenger RNA to support multiple protein isoforms, thereby increasing the diversity of the proteome. While essential for normal development, aberrant splicing underlies a significant number of human diseases, and methods for manipulating alternative splicing could thus have significant therapeutic value. As an example, modified antisense oligonucleotides that re-direct splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from Bcl-xL to -xS were demonstrated to induce apoptosis in breast and prostate cancer cells, while a second nanoparticle-delivered SSO reduced tumor load in lung metastases (Bauman et al. 2010).\nSteric Blocking Oligonucleotides. Myotonic dystrophy is characterized by expansion of triplet repeats of the mRNA (typically CAG and CUG) from 5 to 35 copies, in healthy individuals, to as many as 2500 in the disease state. In myotonia, the expanded CUG repeat-containing transcript binds and sequesters the splicing factor muscleblind-like protein 1, rendering it unavailable for splicing of several pre-mRNAs, including the chloride channel protein 1 (CLCN1), resulting in muscle hyperexcitability (Lee and Cooper 2009). In a mouse model, Wheeler et al. (2009) demonstrated that injecting a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) complementary to the CUG repeat displaced muscleblind-like protein 1, corrected CNCL1 pre-mRNA splicing, resulting in restoration of transmembrane chloride channel conductance and a marked reduction in myotonia.\nExternal Guide Sequence (EGS) Oligonucleotides. EGS oligonucleotides are designed to bind their mRNA target and assume a structure that is recognized and degraded by RNase P (a ubiquitous endonuclease that matures the termini of tRNAs), thereby impairing translation. Jiang et al. have used the EGS strategy to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gene expression by targeting the viral protease-specifying mRNA for degradation (Jiang et al. 2011), while the clinical implications of an EGS comprised of a (PMO) backbone have been suggested by effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant gram negative bacteria (Wesolowski et al. 2011).\nRNA Interacting Polynucleotides (RIPtides). Microarrays allowing multiple candidate ligand sequences to be evaluated in parallel should provide an invaluable platform for oligonucleotide-based RNA targeting. Early studies of small libraries (300\u2013400) combining 2\u2032-O-methyl ribonucleotides and locked nucleic acids (Kierzek 2009) have been superseded by the development of 2\u2032-O-methyl RIPtide arrays bearing the four natural nucleobases, varying from 4- to 8-m in length (Gude et al. 2012), which provide almost 90,000 individual probes. The RIPtide approach has been successfully used to identify oligonucleotides that inhibit human telomerase function both in vitro and in cultured cells (Gude et al. 2012).\nTranslation Suppressing Oligonucleotides (TSOs). PMOs described above represent a class of 2\u2032-O-substituted ribonucleotides that are not recognized by host RNasesH or the RNA-induced silencing complex, and thus do not promote target degradation. These attributes can be exploited by TSOs in that their binding at or near the initiation codon will have the consequence of antagonizing ribosome binding and translation of the target protein. A more detailed description of these approaches can be found in excellent reviews on RNA therapeutics by Kole et al. (2012), Burnett and Rossi (2012).\n",

This interaction, in conjunction with the cellular co-factor transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb), significantly enhances transcription elongation (Karn 1999). As such, targeting the Tat/TAR axis to interrupt the virus life cycle at the level of transcription can be considered. However, additional roles of TAR suggest it could also be targeted to affect multiple steps of reverse transcription. Since the TAR and poly(A) hairpins collectively constitute the repeat (R) region, they are represented at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the (+) strand viral RNA, and likely play a role in (\u2212) strand DNA transfer, which exploits R homology. Mutagenesis studies (Berkhout et al. 2001) have shown that structural features of the TAR hairpin facilitate (\u2212) strand DNA transfer, while Huthoff and Berkhout (2001) have demonstrated that mutations in the same region affect the equilibrium between the alternate configurations of the 5\u2032 UTR (designated the long distance base pairing and branched conformations) that regulate tRNA-primed initiation of reverse transcription. A role for TAR in initiation of reverse transcription has also been proposed (Harrich et al. 2000).

Despite this promising result, in vivo efficacy was not observed. However, subsequent studies have been encouraging, showing that polyamide nucleic acid analogs (PNAs) designed to interact with the TAR apical loop and adjacent bulged nucleotides substantially inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in vitro system and, when transfected into CEM cells, lead to a significant drop in virus infectivity (Kaushik et al. 2002).",

Although Lee et al. have elegantly demonstrated inhibition of HIV-1 replication in MT-4 cells at non-toxic concentrations (Lee et al. 2005), the conformational flexibility of linear polypeptides had the drawback of promoting off-target interactions and sensitivity to proteolysis. These drawbacks can, however, be overcome by the construction of \u201cstapled\u201d or conformationally-constrained peptides. First described in 2004 as a means of activating apoptosis to target leukemia (Walensky et al. 2004), stapling of native peptides represents a novel therapeutic strategy by modulating protein-protein interactions. Using a similar strategy, Varani and colleagues (Lalonde et al. 2011) have designed a series of cyclic, cell-permeable peptides that competitively inhibit the Tat/TAR interaction in vivo at sub-micromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, but in keeping with the pleiotropic nature of the Tat/TAR axis, time-of-addition experiments indicated that, in addition to viral transcription, these cyclic peptides also acted at the level of reverse transcription. Resistance of branched peptide (BP) ligands to proteases and peptidases has promoted their use as a novel class of multivalent non-toxic, cell-permeable therapeutics. These features have been exploited to create a class of peptides that bound TAR RNA with low to sub-micromolar affinity (Bryson et al. 2012), most likely spanning nucleotides of both the apical loop and neighboring trinucleotide bulge.",

The ATCUN motif features a three amino acid sequence, X1-X2-His, of which X1 and X2 can be any amino acid and X1 must have a free amino terminal group. This approach would require simple modification of linear peptides and, while the cyclic peptides afford no free N-terminus, appending the tripeptide to a lysine side chain is feasible, thereby creating a \u201cmetallo-peptide\u201d capable of targeting TAR and promoting its nucleolytic degradation.

Our own work has involved the construction of small molecule microarrays that can be probed with fluorescently-labeled RNA structural motifs, such as the TAR apical loop. Using this approach (Sztuba-Solinska et al. 2014), we have identified a novel chemotype (Fig. 2d) that binds the TAR hairpin with micromolar affinity, inhibits HIV-1 replication in culture and is not cytotoxic.

The interaction of human lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS) with the capsid (CA) domain of the Gag precursor (via its C-terminal domain or CTD) was identified by Kleiman and colleagues, whose related studies elegantly showed that disrupting LysRS synthesis reduced tRNALys,3 incorporation into virions its and annealing to the viral RNA genome (Guo et al. 2003). With the goal of disrupting LysRS/CA interactions, combinatorial library screening, Dewan et al. (2012) have subsequently identified two cyclic peptides (whose clinical application takes advantage of their enhanced resistance to proteolytic degradation) that are active in vitro in the low micromolar range.

However, a landmark NMR study of a dimeric RNA containing the entire 5\u2032 UTR and the immediate 5\u2032 region of gag has provided an elegant model that proposes the -G-G-A-G- tetraloop of the packaging signal (\u03a8, defined by stem-loop (SL) 3 of the core HIV-1 packaging domain) is recognized by the NC domain of the Gag precursor through an RNA structural switch linking translation, dimerization and packaging (Lu et al. 2011) (Fig. 4a, b). A subsequent study (Stephenson et al. 2013), has coupled chemical probing data of the 5\u2032 UTR with through-space distances derived from single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. This analysis, while supporting models derived by NMR, highlighted a kink-turn motif whose mutagenesis was previously shown to impair packaging, suggesting it may provide a Gag binding site. Together, these complementary, high-resolution techniques have provided a much-needed structural basis for antiviral strategies designed to interrupt genome packaging, possibly antagonizing the proposed Gag-mediated structural switch from translation of the viral genome to its incorporation into the budding virion.\n",

Two of these ligands bound with micromolar affinity, displayed enhanced selectivity for \u03a8-containing RNA over non-specific single- and double-stranded RNA, and disrupted the interaction with HIV-1 NC protein as measured by gel electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Bell et al. have designed a high-throughput fluorogenic assay that monitors Gag-mediated disruption of the \u03a8-containing SL-3 RNA and used this to screen two small molecule libraries totaling ~2600 compounds (Bell et al. 2013). In addition to chemotypes previously shown to interact with DNA, these authors identified the quinolinium derivative NSC260594 (Fig. 4c) that in culture significantly reduced virus infectivity in the low micromolar range. 1H-NMR spectroscopy of SL-3 in the presence of NSC260594 indicated little to no influence on stem nucleotides, while in contrast, significant perturbation of nucleotides comprising the -G-G-A-G- tetraloop was observed in the presence of a molar equivalent of the ligand, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry. An equivalent analysis demonstrated that the non-discriminatory intercalator ellipticine interacted exclusively with nucleotides of the SL-3 stem, providing a promising measure of NSC260594 specificity. The notion that an important interaction of Gag with viral RNA might be the targeted by this small molecule can be inferred from 1H-NMR studies (De Guzman et al. 1998), which have shown that the SL-3 -G-G-A-G- tetraloop provides a tight binding site for HIV-1 NC. Finally, targeting \u03a8 RNA may not be restricted to small molecules, evidenced by 1H-NMR analysis demonstrating that a short, tryptophan-rich polypeptide (proposed as an NC mimic) also interacts with the -G-G-A-G- tetraloop (Dietz et al. 2008).",

The frameshift signal of HIV-1 group M is illustrated in Fig. 5a, b, comprising a heptanucleotide \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence followed by the frameshift stimulatory signal, an irregular helix whose upper and lower stem are separated by a 3-nucleotide purine bulge (a feature maintained within an individual subtype, while varying between subtypes). Although the precise mechanism underlying frameshifting remains open to debate, maintaining the correct Gag:Gag-Pol ratio appears critical to virion assembly and maturation. Small molecules or nucleic acids that interact with the frameshift signal and alter this critical balance through its disruption or stabilization would therefore seem an attractive therapeutic strategy.\n",

(1998) indicated that the benzene derivative RG501 (Fig. 5c) was capable of increasing HIV-1 frameshift efficiency approximately two-fold and impairing virus spread in culture. However, RG501 was shown to interact with a variety of RNA helices, suggesting toxicity issues would arise as a consequence of preferential targeting of ribosomal RNA. Despite the negative outcome, Marscheschi et al. (2011) have demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy that RG501 binds in the major groove of the frameshift signal and, by hydrogen bonding to phosphate groups on opposite sides, alters the conformation of the -G-G-A- trinucleotide bulge, providing important structural data for the rational design of derivatives with increased potency and selectivity. Although modification of the basic screening strategy (Dulude et al. 2008) yielded a series of arginine-rich peptides capable of reducing frameshift efficiency, these appeared to be equally non-selective. More encouraging results have been reported by Ofori et al. (2014), who have investigated the effect of nucleic acid-intercalating peptide antibiotics on ribosomal frameshifting. Among these, a benzo [g] quinolone-containing analog (Fig. 5d) bound the frameshift site with an affinity of ~100 nM, and with increased selectivity over non-specific RNA. This analog was cell permeable, exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, and decreased virus infectivity, which correlated with increased levels of frameshifting. In parallel with the search for improved small molecule ligands, the potential of oligonucleotide-based inhibition, via steric blocking, should not be overlooked, based on studies by Ahn et al. (2011a) who demonstrated that PNAs designed to hybridize to the frameshift site suppressed replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, while a second class that targets the three major stem-loop (SL) domains of X-RNA inhibited RNA synthesis initiation in hepatitis C virus (Ahn et al. 2011b).",

Likewise, trans-dominant negative Rev mutants, while a promising alternative, led to rapid acquisition of mutations conferring resistance (Legiewicz et al. 2008). Thus, new modalities of targeting the Rev/RRE interaction are warranted. Both structural and mutagenesis analyses have shown that the \u03b1-helical arginine-rich motif (ARM) of Rev mediates a critical interaction with the RRE by inserting into the major groove of an asymmetric bulge in stem-loop IIB. Based on these observations, Mills et al. (2006) synthesized a series of ARM-like conformationally-constrained peptidomimetics to antagonize the Rev/RRE interaction. Of 15 candidate peptidomimetics examined, one bound the RRE with equivalent affinity as the ARM (K\nd ~50 nM), while control experiments indicated that its unconstrained counterpart showed little specificity.",

Such bifunctional metallo-inhibitors combine a high affinity targeting motif (the Rev ARM) with a metal chelate complex capable of damaging RNA in the vicinity of the ARM binding site via a variety of oxidative chemistries. Proof of this strategy was demonstrated by the ability of Cu++-Gly-Gly-His-ARM complexes to selectively cleave the RRE both in vitro (Jin and Cowan 2006) and in vivo (Jin and Cowan 2007). This approach has more recently been extended to investigate the oxidative properties of the Rev ARM when linked to the metal chelators 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), diethylenetriamineepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) (Joyner and Cowan 2013) (Fig. 6). For each of these complexes, high affinity binding to RRE stem-loop IIB was retained (varying from 0.2 to 16 nM versus 1.6 nM for the unmodified peptide). The Cu++-bound metal chelates of each were found to be most efficient in RRE cleavage, with activity varying 15-fold in the order Cu-NTA-Rev > Cu-DOTA-Rev > Cu-DTPA-Rev > Cu-EDTA-Rev, representing a ~50-fold improvement over the Cu++-Gly-Gly-His-ARM complex. In a biological setting, oxidative damage of the RRE would result in dissociation of the metal chelate-ARM complex, which can be \u201creactivated\u201d by reducing agents such as ascorbic acid or glutathione, the concentration of which is sufficiently high in vivo. Also, since the K\nd for the bound metal is of the order of 10\u221215 M, toxicity resulting from its leaching from the complex is likely to be minimal.\n",

High throughput screening of an ~50,000 branched peptide boronic acid (BPBA) library, (whose boronic acid substituent was designed to mimic an acceptor for RNA 2\u2032 OH groups as well as improve selectivity for RNA over DNA) identified a candidate peptide (BPBA1) that bound RRE stem-loop IIB with micromolar affinity (Zhang et al. 2013) and a 1:1 stoichiometry. Significant losses in binding affinity with linear peptides (~50-fold) suggested that all \u201carms\u201d of this branched peptide participated in its interaction with stem-loop IIB. A complementary analysis with stem-loop IIB variants provided strong support for the notion that the correct tertiary structure of the target RNA was a prerequisite to high affinity BPBA1 binding. Consistent with these findings, enzymatic footprinting highlighted several regions of stem-loop IIB that were rendered nuclease-insensitive in the presence of the branched peptide. Finally, studies with fluorescent derivative suggest that BPBA1 can be taken up by cells, although its ability to suppress HIV-1 replication remains to be established.",

            "text": "Despite extensive mutagenesis analysis (Rausch and Le Grice 2007), the structural basis for resistance of PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids to RNase H-mediated cleavage remains unclear. However, structural studies that combined mass spectrometry with NMR (Turner et al. 2008), raise the possibility that the PPT could be targeted by small molecules designed to antagonize its selection or removal from nascent (+) DNA. Electrospray ionization-Fourier transfer ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry has the particular advantage of allowing multiplexing, i.e. the interaction of nucleic acid ligands with several PPT variants could be simultaneously investigated, based on their mass signatures. Using this approach, Turner et al. showed that short PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids contained two binding sites for the aminoglycoside neomycin B (Turner et al. 2008). Tandem mass spectrometry (which essentially provided a \u201cfootprint\u201d of the PPT/neomycin B complex) demonstrated that, at a 1:1 neomycin B:PPT ratio, the aminoglycoside bound at the PPT/U3 junction. Increasing this ratio to 2:1 identified the second, upstream aminoglycoside binding site at the 5\u2032 extremity of the PPT (Fig. 7). Consistent with these observations, 1H-NMR of a 1:1 neomycin B:PPT hybrid showed shifts in imino proton signals at positions corresponding to the PPT/U3 junction and evidence for a second binding site as the ratio was increased. Subsequent NMR analysis in the presence of HIV-1 RT indicated contact between protein and nucleic acid in the same two regions, while equivalent findings with RT from the LTR-retrotransposon Ty3 and its cognate PPT (Brinson et al. 2009) suggested that structural features at either extremity of the PPT may be a more general feature contributing to its recognition. Such data are not intended to imply the therapeutic use of neomycin B, which is known to bind to a variety of RNA structures, but rather to illustrate that more selective nucleic acid ligands could be developed to disrupt (+) strand DNA synthesis.\n",

Studies by Volkmann and Moelling have demonstrated that, in vitro, a TFO targeted against the PPT rendered the PPT/U3 junction refractory to RNase H-mediated hydrolysis and, as a consequence, inhibited initiation of (+) strand DNA synthesis (Volkmann et al. 1995). In order to determine whether the PPT sequence of the single-stranded viral RNA genome and not the RNA/DNA replication intermediate might also respond to triplex formation, these authors targeted the single-stranded PPT with a TFO wherein the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing sequence were on the same strand and separated by a short linker sequence. This \u201csandwich\u201d TFO, which was suggested to be thermodynamically more efficient than the three-stranded system, also rendered the PPT refractory to RNase H-mediated cleavage in vitro, and inhibited de novo HIV infection in culture. Finally, although the HIV RNA genome is the focus of this review, it is worth noting that Giovannangeli et al. have used the TFO approach to target the HIV-1 PPT in the context of the integrated proviral DNA. Using a TFO-psoralen conjugate, these authors successfully converted the non-covalent three-stranded structure into a localized covalent lesion on genomic DNA following UV irradiation of cells (Giovannangeli et al. 1997).",

A promising advance in this area has been the development of short cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), comprising combinations of natural or unnatural amino acids, the basis of which was the original observation that HIV-1 Tat could enter cells when added to the culture medium. In addition to the arginine-rich Tat peptide, other natural CPPs have been identified, including penetratin, herpesvirus tegument protein VP22 and inv3 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, each of which has the capacity to promote intracellular uptake of conjugated cargoes (Copolovici et al. 2014). As proof-of-principle, Roisin et al.

Oligonucleotides containing peptide nucleic acid (PNA) locked nucleic acid (LNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) analogs are most commonly used in order to avoid complications arising through interactions between negatively charged nucleic acid and the positively charged CPP. Following their uptake, endosomal release of CPP-oligonucleotide complexes presents the next challenge. Inhibitory CPP-PNA conjugates targeted to the TAR hairpin could be released from endosomes by chloroquine treatment which, while clinically impractical, demonstrated endosomal release as a rate limiting step (Turner et al. 2005). Alternative strategies to promote endosomal release have included the identification of CPPs that themselves elicit endosomolytic activity and CPP modification via stearylation, myristoylation or incorporation of chloroquine-functionalized dendrons on the backbone. A more comprehensive review of CPP-directed oligonucleotide delivery, its challenges and future potential can be found in Lee et al. (2013).",
