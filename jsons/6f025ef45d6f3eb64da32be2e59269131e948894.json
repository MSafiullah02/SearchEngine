The chapter shows how their poor state of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) can be the outcome of a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected and should be investigated in respect of: (a) the worth of their 'identity' (migrant, female, the work they do); (b) the distinct aspects of discourse on sexuality and normativity which specifically relate to their presence in the destination countries; and (c) ideational and material realities constraining their own agency in finding adequate care. The chapter shows how variations in the potential for access may be explained by the types and degree of their structural vulnerability regarding labour rights, their relationship with employers and migrants' associations, and their personal SRH awareness-together with what emerges from cooperation between those government officials and civil society organizations who work with migrant domestic workers. Attentiveness to the particular combination of forms of institutional discrimination in a given cultural and institutional context, especially the ways in which the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Filipina domestic workers are linked to the ways in which labour migration are organized, should be helpful for effective SRH advocacy.",

This has led to the tendency for migrants to be portrayed by some ac-tors involved as a risk to public health. In recent years the global campaign for the right to health as a fundamental human right has opened the way for civil society organizations and scholars to develop and establish an approach to the health needs of labour migrants which enables their voices to be heard and properly addressed (WHO 2010) . The plight of labour migrants who occupy the range of occupations in the global economy defined as low-skilled or unskilled (often with temporary contractual arrangements, or in sectors not covered by labour protection laws in either the sending or destination countries, or both) has become a major concern from the standpoint of social justice in health (Dwyer 2004) . The fragmented understanding of sexuality in health matters calls for more creative cooperation between health research and migration research to steer policy agendas towards providing more appropriate responses to the SRH needs of labour migrants.",

            "text": "Uncovering the complex relationship between migration and health (particularly how the operation of certain migration systems these days can have a serious impact on the occupational and personal health of transnational labour migrants) requires a revision of the ways of understanding labour migration. Most policy and research concerning migration presents a prototype of the labour migrant as a unit in the macroeconomic theory of exchange, and focuses on financial gains and losses rather than on the realities as lived by migrants. More attentiveness and openness to how life actually is for people on the move across borders, and to the patterns of their inclusion in and exclusion from societies, is crucial for an effective approach to their right to health in line with international human rights law. 4 Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is a relatively new field of inquiry in migration research. Here, we take a holistic approach and explore how a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected can affect how SRH problems are solved for migrant domestic workers. First, the concept of SRH is set out as a normative framework, and this is followed by a discussion on the concept of structural vulnerability to ill health that has been introduced in medical anthropology and applied to the situations of marginal labour migrants. This concept is then adjusted for the analysis of SRH situations faced by domestic workers from the Philippines in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar. Data compiled on the experiences of migrant women domestic workers during their years of employment in these destination countries are presented, and the variations discussed. 5 The conclusion proposes new avenues for SRH advocates to take on board the needs of mobile populations in a globalized world and to cooperate with mi-gration researchers, so that they can promote appropriate responses to migrant workers' health needs.",

Glasier, G\u00fclmezoglu, Schmid, Moreno, and Look (2006) point out that SRH encompasses the totality of a person's sexual and gendered existence, and involves multiple and overlapping domains: the body, social identity, beliefs, attitudes, expressions, behaviour, and the social relationships through which desires are expressed and health is ensured. Although the majority of sexual and reproductive health issues affect women, men are also subject to such health risks, and are party to many of the related methods, techniques, and services that ensure healthy lives. It should be emphasized that sexual and reproductive health is not only about illness and disease but also 2006: 1604) . This ambiguity has significant implications for SRH advocates (in respect of migrant populations) as well as for migrants themselves. In particular, SRH advocacy is very limited for workers on temporary contracts in countries where their work is not included in the labour law provisions, and where there is limited social consciousness of the significance of SRH generally and within a person's emotional life specifically. As they are mostly of reproductive age, women migrant workers do not become sexually inactive once they cross a national border. Though loneliness and homesickness are common for newly arrived and firsttime migrant workers, for those who have had to leave their families and partners for work many times, periodical yearnings for intimacy and for the feeling of 'being home' socially and sexually continue to occur (Marin 2012) . Having to manage an existence which stretches between different localities with multiple identities-citizen, migrant, worker, wife, husband, intimate partner, son, daughter-these migrant workers also must renegotiate meanings of love, loyalty, and affection at a distance, while simultaneously establishing a new set of social bonds in their new place. Emotional expression in such a context requires the careful consideration of the specific social boundaries defined by the time-bound nature of their stay, the intersubjective and cultural meanings of intimacy, and the consequences they must face when transgressing the norms of propriety related to SRH at the place of their employment (Marin 2012) . Knowledge about the SRH of migrant domestic workers as a social group cannot be gained from a specific position declared as 'universal'. It requires the unravelling of many layers of power in different places that shape migrants' overlapping social identities and sense of belonging, layers which define the right to reveal their SRH needs and entitlement to care services.",

Quesada, Hart, and Bourgois (2012: 341) identify the following: 1) the formation of social hierarchies buttressed by a hierarchy of symbolic meanings of worthiness (Bourdieu 2000) ; and 2) historically distinctive discourses of normativity and sexual ethics (Foucault 1979) . In this way, they redefine the concept of 'structural violence' as 'structural vulnerability' in respect of ill health. In the light of Bourdieu's concept of positionality, structural vulnerability to ill health may be seen as produced by an individual's location in a given hierarchical social order that either enables or constrains the ability to act, negotiate, and change those contextually specific power relations affecting personal health. Quesada, Hart, and Bourgois (2012) suggest that positionality-defined as the interplay between subjective and objective-can help bridge the binary distinction between structure and agency in order to give more visibility to the socially learned dispositions, skills, and ways of acting that are often taken for granted, but which are acquired primarily through the activities and accumulated experiences of everyday life.",

The key question is whether this heterogeneity reflects the functioning of health care systems per se, or whether there are, indeed, barriers to health services which may well be the outcome of the ways labour migration pro-grammes are organized -and thus shape workers' agency and health-seeking behaviour as well as access to services.

So therefore, despite formal commitments made by the government to implement international standards on SRH, 9 programmes have mainly been supported by international development organizations. 10 The resulting absence of a national policy on SRH hampers the implementation of comprehensive and concerted programmes within the country, and undermines the commitment to the sexual and reproductive well-being of overseas workers. Efforts from civil society organizations and some local government units have been made to provide services that cover all the ten elements of reproductive health recognized by the Philippine government. But these remain far from the international normative framework of SRH rights. Family planning services are available in most public health facilities but with varying degrees of effectiveness, because of the strong influence of faith-based organizations who only accept natural family planning methods. There has been erratic and uneven dissemination of SRH information across the country. Moreover, access to quality health services is constrained by high costs, inefficiencies in health care management, and socio-cultural norms. There is limited availability of contraceptives and poor dissemination of information on how to prevent early unwanted pregnancy, or the risk of pregnancy. The power of the church means that contesting the normative understanding on the relationship between sexuality and health and attempts to meet some of the critical SHR health needs of the population can only be negotiated between civil society organizations and local government institutions. For overseas workers, restrictions imposed by the host countries on the practice of non-national health professionals limit the ability of embassies and consulates to provide actual and direct medical services. They can only refer overseas workers to service providers in the host countries, or facilitate repatriation.",

The existing body of knowledge on SRH of migrant workers is too small and does not contain the hard data often required by policy-makers and programme implementers to institute the necessary services. Furthermore, there is an overwhelming concern among civil society organizations about labour issues, which is putting SRH rather in the shade on the government agenda. In destination countries faith-based organizations have been in the lead in raising SRH consciousness through programmes conducted with migrant workers and local authorities. Since they are at the bottom of the hierarchy of social worthiness, migrant domestic workers must rely on either their employers or faith-based organizations to recognize their right as persons to health and well-being.",

            "text": "In Singapore foreign workers are classified by level of education and income, according to which the government grants permission for terms of residence. Employment passes are granted to foreign professionals whose monthly earnings reach a certain threshold set by the government; they are widely known as 'foreign talents'. At the lower end of the income/profession spectrum, employers are granted permits to take 'unskilled or semi-skilled' workers, whom Singaporeans refer to as 'foreign workers'. Foreign domestic workers are called \"Foreigners in Our Homes\" (Teo/ Piper 2009) . The work permits are issued on the condition that the women do not marry Singaporeans nor become pregnant. Standard employment contracts in Singapore now state that registered employers must ensure medical care and treatment is covered for the duration of the employment. Foreign workers without valid work permits are unable to access the government health system to the same degree as those with permits, and they do not have access to a government health subsidy. In March 2012 the Manpower Ministry granted foreign domestic workers a weekly rest day. 15 By contrast, Qatar has a very poor record in the treatment of foreign workers. They are excluded from Law 14 of 2004 that governs labour in the private sector, which limits working hours and sets requirements on paid annual leave, health and safety, and prompt payment of wages each month. Neither this law nor supporting legislation sets a minimum wage. The Law allows only Qatari workers to form unions, and permits strikes only with prior government approval. Qatar has 150 labour inspectors to monitor compliance with the labour law, though inspections do not include worker interviews. 16 Excluded from the labour law as they are, foreign workers do not benefit from these provisions. Together with construction workers, domestic workers come under a 1963 'Sponsorship Law', known as the kafala system, which regulates their entry and employment. change jobs without their sponsoring employer's consent, other than in exceptional cases with permission from the Interior Ministry. A Qatari company, which can be run by a private citizen or a foreign national, acts as the sponsor who procures a visa for a worker. The sponsor has effective control over the movements of their worker in Qatar for the duration of the contract. They frequently confiscate workers' passports, although this is in violation of the Sponsorship Law. The worker cannot leave the country, buy a car, or rent a home without the sponsor's permission. Although sponsors are required to give workers an endof-year bonus, a return airline ticket, and medical insurance, failure to do so is often not penalized. Nonobservance of requirements for minimum wage, overtime wage, and timely payment is common. Non-compliance which results in the disadvantaged employees leaving the job situation can be a basis for the employer to report the worker as 'having absconded', which leads to a threat of detention and deportation. 17 Despite these variations in the legal treatment of migrant domestic workers in the three countries, socially these workers share a common condition of being confined to individual households as their place of work as well as residence. In Hong Kong and Singapore, where they are allowed to have a day off, their regular use of public spaces around the cities -to socialize and enjoy a brief moment of privacy away from their employers -has led to the formation of 'ephemeral enclaves' which have become an issue for local citizens who perceive this as a form of nuisance, inconvenience, or even threat. Markers of cultural and ethnic identities have emerged as a 'cordon' around the public spaces used; these are then avoided by local citizens (Koh 2009; Tillu 2011) . Such is the powerful effect of cultural inscriptions on physical space. In Qatar some employers have allowed their domestic workers a day off every Friday, in principle to study Islam. This was the only way the domestic workers could spend time outside the house of their employers. 18 It can be said that the social standing of migrant domestic workers within the hierarchy of foreign labour is defined by specific processes of inclusion and exclusion. The interplay between different identitieslegal, economic, political, and sociocultural-is accentuated in conjunction with gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and nationality (Yeoh/Huang 2000 . One common concern is sexuality, where the condition of nonentry and expulsion includes medical 'unfitness', covering 'being pregnant' and having Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Once placed in their jobs, domestic workers must go through periodic mandatory health checks for specific SRH (Guild/Mantu 2011: 80-103) . Birth prevention during migration, with all the legal and medical risks involved, is left to a migrant's discretion.",

The increased diversification of ethnicity and nationalities among the population of migrant workers has led to mosques and Buddhist temples also providing programmes for them which include religious education and recreational activities. There has also been a rise in the number of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) active in lending support and assistance to migrant workers. 19 It is also important to note that the general consciousness of SRH in Hong Kong promoted under the Family Planning Programme 20 is resulting in some direct benefits for migrant domestic workers, as will be shown in the next section.",

Three participants in focus group discussions (FGDs) experienced reproductive health ailments and were interviewed at length as case studies. Local research partners further identified four other domestic workers who had experienced sexual and reproductive health problems as case study informants. In-depth interviews generated important information on how the women dealt with their health problems, given their knowledge of and attitudes towards health and conditions of work. A key point that has emerged is the intersection of individual SRH problems with various facets of institutional exclusion. SRH services are generally available in all three study sites, but financial and social barriers to access are the major problem. Policies on certain sexual and reproductive health issues differ between the three study sites. Abortion is legal in Hong Kong and Singapore within specific parameters: it has to be performed by a doctor; the woman has to undergo counselling and a medical going-over performed by at least two physicians who approve the procedure. In Qatar abortion is illegal. Though all three countries have policies on health insurance applicable to migrant domestic workers for the duration of their employment contract, information gathered from fieldwork suggests it is mainly only workers in Hong Kong who enjoy this privilege. In Singapore there were participants who had insurance and there were those who said they didn't. There were also participants who did not know they were supposed to have health insurance. This was common among the participants in Qatar; those who could access medical services emphasized the instigating role of the employers.",

The level of SRH awareness among interviewees varied but was generally very low and included a number of misconceptions with consequences for their health.

A sense of discomfort surged among some of the FGD participants when these matters came up for discussion as they were considered shameful. Even when they experience SRH problems they find it uncomfortable to talk to their friends, and even more so to a male doctor who is not even a Filipino. Going for a medical examination that would involve showing a doctor their private parts is even more unthinkable. As a result, a simple infection of the reproductive tract can become serious because only when their condition has worsened do they find the courage to make mention. Those who talked with more comfort about the matters related to sex and SRH were older and had worked in the study sites longer. They did not mind sharing intimate experiences such as masturbation and showing the younger women in the group that they should learn to be more comfortable about issues of sexuality, reject taboos, and accept these issues as a normal part of life. Some FGD participants admitted to engaging in sexual relationships while in their country of employment, divulging also that they used condoms. They did not always seek medical attention or health services when they felt sick.

Findings on overseas domestic workers from the Philippines in this study show how power relations can be articulated in ways that shape their structural vulnerability to SRH problems. The articulation depends greatly on context and place irrespective of the fact that the three countries share the common denominator of an excellent health system. Most significantly, the link between the SRH problems experienced by a migrant domestic worker as an individual and the mechanisms of exclusion from, or inclusion in, SRH services operates simultaneously at ideational and material levels. Ensuring affordable services is not enough; gaining awareness and knowledge about the right to exercise the right to SHR health seems crucial, particularly among migrant domestic workers whose health-seeking behaviour is constrained by conventional norms of sexuality and a range of choices that are far from risk-free. International migration connects countries of origin, transit, and destination, and it is important for governments to recognize the complex intersection between migration systems and health systems. A purely national approach to migration and health is too limited to respond to the health needs of migrant workers. Bilateral, multi-country, and multi-sectoral dialogues would help foster collaboration and partnership to harmonize the responses to these needs. Various regional and subregional forums addressing transnational health challenges such as HIV and AIDS, SARS, avian influenza, and the H1N1 virus are already in place. Efforts to address migrants' health, and in particular SRH, must take note of the specific structural vulnerability they are subject to and recog-nize the intricate workings of power over the female human body.

Depending on the situation and location, the health of migrants may have important implications for the populations from which they originate, through which they travel, and where they live and work.

The key is to eliminate disparities in access to health services, facilities, and goods between migrants and host populations, bearing in mind the financing implications for existing health systems. It implies the creation of an environment that enables migrants to enjoy their full rights, which must include those of sexual and reproductive health. This will need to be done along with proactive strategies that address the totality of migrants' human rights. In the area of migrants' SRH it is important to continue generating more evidence. This should include further investigation and analysis of trends and patterns in the SRH status of migrant workers, the mapping of existing SRH services, policies, and information, and identification of good practices in addressing migrant workers' SRH needs. Qualitative evidence of needs articulated through the voices of migrants is crucial to improving existing SRH programmes and services. As Marin (2012) emphasizes, the gathering, dissemination, and utilization of information must take into account issues of human security such as security of identity, since disclosure of sensitive data or information about migrants could put them in a precarious situation.
