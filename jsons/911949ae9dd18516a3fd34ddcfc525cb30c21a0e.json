The concise ProQOL manual, 2010). At the same time, oncologists can experience compassion satisfactionthat is, the positive aspects of caring. This study explored the associations of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction with oncologists' grief and sense of failure beyond their reported exposure to suffering and death. Methods Seventy-four oncologists completed self-administered questionnaires examining compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, grief, exposure to suffering and death, and sense of failure.",

            "text": "Results The oncologists reported that they face the loss of approximately 50% of their patients, and that their patients suffer from profound emotional and physical pain. High levels of compassion fatigue and grief, and moderate levels of sense of failure, were reported. Findings showed a lack of association between exposure to suffering and death and compassion fatigue and satisfaction. However, grief and sense of failure were found to predict both aspects of compassion fatigue: secondary traumatic stress (p < 0.001, p < 0.003, respectively) and burnout (p < 0.002, p < 0.025, respectively). Conclusions These results highlight the importance of the oncologists' subjective experiences of grief and sense of failure, beyond their reports of exposure to suffering and death, in terms of their levels of compassion fatigue. Implications of these findings include the need to develop interventions for oncologists that will allow them to acknowledge, process, and overcome negative experiences of failure and grief.",

Compassion fatigue is composed of burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS), both of which are regarded as negative implications of the work. Burnout usually develops in response to work environment characteristics (e.g., workload, nonsupportive work environment) and includes feelings of exhaustion, frustration, anger, and depression. Secondary traumatic stress develops in response to exposure to patients' traumatic events, and its symptoms include intrusive thoughts, avoidant behavior, and high levels of tension [4, 5] . Compassion satisfaction is regarded as embodying the positive feelings that professionals might derive from their practice, such as the pleasure of helping others and the feeling of success in helping others [4, 5] . As compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction can coexist [4] , some researchers view compassion satisfaction as a protective factor against the development of compassion fatigue [6] .",

Nevertheless, oncologists may also experience grief over the deaths of their patients. Giddings [14] wrote that grief is usually experienced by oncologists in response to the loss of a patient who has touched them in some particular way or who has reminded them of the reasons they chose to go into their profession. Granek and colleagues [9, 13, [15] [16] [17] conducted an in-depth qualitative investigations of oncologists' grief and pointed to its uniqueness in that it derives, at least in part, from a sense of responsibility for the patient's life. Oncologists' grief includes, besides sorrow, feelings of powerlessness, self-doubt, and guilt [13] . Interestingly, no correlation was found between the time that had passed since the patient's death and the duration of the oncologist's grief, which might last only a few hours or, alternatively, never entirely disappear [16] . It has been suggested that when oncologists' grief is not treated, they may lose the capacity to be compassionate and dedicated to their patients [18] , potentially an expression of compassion fatigue. Moreover, grief may cause the oncologist to alter treatment decisions or withdraw from patients and their families [13] . Despite this considerable potential impact on oncologists at both the personal and professional levels, oncologists' grief has not been, to the best of our knowledge, quantitatively examined.",

            "text": "Compassion fatigue, a known risk factor among professional caregivers, is considered to be a result of secondary exposure to others' traumatic experiences [3] . As reported herein, oncologists are indeed highly exposed to the suffering and deaths of their patients. Unlike other professional caregivers (e.g., psychotherapists), oncologists do not learn about their patients' traumas merely through patients' reports and stories; rather, they witness their patients' suffering firsthand. Moreover, oncologists often perceive themselves as being responsible for the suffering experienced by their patients, and even for their deaths [18] . Therefore, the repeated experiences of grief and sense of failure can be regarded as primary traumas experienced by the oncologists themselves [15, 17, 29] , rather than as secondary exposure to traumatic experiences. It is possible that oncologists develop compassion fatigue in response to their primary exposure to the trauma of repeated loss and perceived failure, and not only in response to their secondary exposure to suffering and death. An additional finding of the current study was the low to moderate negative correlations between compassion fatigue aspects and compassion satisfaction, indicating that the two constructs are not \"two sides of the same coin\" but two separate constructs that can coexist. In other words, the fact that the oncologists reported high levels of compassion fatigue did not prevent them from experiencing compassion satisfaction. Interestingly, it seems that compassion satisfaction was more negatively associated with the burnout aspect of compassion fatigue than with the STS. As burnout is usually related to work environment [4] , it is possible that this factor could be modified in order to increase oncologists' compassion satisfaction.",

Nevertheless, we found a negative association between compassion satisfaction and sense of failure. This association highlights the importance of focusing on sense of failure in future interventions designed to improve oncologists' professional quality of life.",

Specifically, providing oncologists with an opportunity to process and reflect on their role and on their losses might ease their distress and, accordingly, improve their ability to be available to their patients.",
