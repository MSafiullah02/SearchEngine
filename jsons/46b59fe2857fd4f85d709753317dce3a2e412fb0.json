The scientific and political communities have reacted to this challenge with a varied degree of urgency. The initial days were mired by a lack of accurate and adequate recommendations. This was related to the fact that this was a novel virus and nothing was known about it. However, with the scientific community reacting aggressively to the situation, we got a fairly good understanding of how the virus attaches to the host cells, causes organ damage, and probable treatment targets. This resulted in a flurry of studies conducted in order to arm the healthcare sector. We saw Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and resmdesivir, being extensively tested as possible treatment strategies. [1, 2, 3] The trials for an effective vaccine are also ongoing. [4] However, in the interim period we need strategies in place to prevent the spread of infection. Social distancing and hygiene became the targets for preventive strategies. Several countries, including India, went ahead with a stringent lockdown. [5] There is absence of any prior data on the impact of lockdown on prevention of infection. It is of paramount importance to assess the effectiveness of this strategy as the lockdown continues. This study was conducted to analyze the benefits of lockdown on total infection and death rates. Such data are required urgently to aid policymakers into taking a decision on future strategies.",

A few other countries also declared lockdown; however, in view of a lot of missing data, they were excluded from the analysis. We intended to include a parallel comparative arm (countries without complete lockdown). However, due to a variable definition of restrictions imposed in most of the other countries, we could include only Sweden and South Korea (countries with minimal degrees of restrictions) as the additional arm. Instead of using both these countries as comparators, we decided to include them in a cluster analysis and visualize where exactly they fit in.",

The total infection and death rate also decayed exponentially in these countries, comparable to cluster 2.
