Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an important worldwide viral disease of poultry. This poses a major economic threat to the poultry industry because of poor weight gain and lost feed efficiency in broilers and reduced numbers and quality of eggs in layers. In addition, some virulent strains cause high mortality in young chickens due to renal disease.",

Despite a predilection towards the respiratory tract, IBV also infects a wide range of organs, including the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and oviduct, causing respiratory disease, interstitial nephritis, and decreased egg production (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Clinical signs include coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and watery eyes (Cavanagh, 2007, Raj and Jones, 1997). Lesions in infected birds include degeneration of renal epithelium, renal interstitial lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, and degeneration and necrosis of the ciliated respiratory epithelium.",

            "text": "The main method of protecting chickens from IB is inoculation with both attenuated live and inactivated vaccines. Although inactivated vaccines are cheaper and easier to administer, the poultry industry prefers to use live vaccines rather than inactivated ones, as they are more effective (Huang and Wang, 2006). Despite widespread vaccination in China and other countries, IB outbreaks still occur sporadically because of little or no cross protection between different IBV serotypes (Cook et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2009). Specifically, a new IBV variant has been circulating in China since 1998 (Wang et al., 1998). This virus has been identified as the QX strain and has been primarily associated with various renal pathologies (Terregino et al., 2008\nZsofia et al., 2009). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the IBV isolates that clustered with QX were mainly Chinese isolates. These results further indicated that IBV isolates that are prevalent in China were significantly evolutionarily distant from Mass-type strains. However, Mass-type vaccine strains (e.g., H52, H120, Ma5, and W93) are mainly IBV vaccine strains typically administered in China today, which may not be able to provide efficient protection against field strains. Other vaccine strategies including combination of Mass type vaccine with 4/91, Conn type etc., were attempted before and could get a broader protection than the Mass type vaccine alone (Cook et al., 2001, Cook et al., 1999). However, the 4/91 and Conn type vaccine have not been licensed as commercial vaccines in China nowadays. Thus, it will be necessary to rapidly develop new vaccines against the QX-like field strains.",

The viral DNA levels in the spleen, lung, and duodenum in the YN group peaked at 3 dpi and subsequently gradually decreased. No virus was detected in the YN attenuated samples from similar time points. The maximum amount of viral DNA was detected at 5 dpi in the tracheas of both groups and the proventriculus and bursa from the YN group. Viral loads in the kidneys of both groups increased starting at 5 dpi and peaking at 7 and 10 dpi for the YN and attenuated strains, respectively. The proventriculus and lung samples from the YN attenuated group peaked at 7 dpi, and the duodenum and bursa of fabricius samples from the YN attenuated group had peak viral numbers at 10 dpi. All samples except those from the proventriculus contained more viral copies in the YN group. In addition, the number of copies of viral DNA in the trachea and kidneys were significantly greater than other organs at the same time.",

            "text": "The best protection against challenge is achieved by a vaccine containing homologous strains (Gelb et al., 1990). As previously demonstrated in some reports, cross-protection is poor between different serotypes and genotypes of IBV strains. Consequently, currently available vaccines cannot provide sufficient protection for heterologous challenge (Cavanagh and Cook, 1997, Gelb et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006). The S1 gene of IBV has serotype-specific and neutralization-specific epitopes. Serotype evolution and the genetic diversity of IBV are monitored by analysis of the S1 gene. The majority of QX-like IBV isolates present in the field in China had poor similarity in the S1 part of the spike protein with vaccine strains, indicating the antigenic differences and large evolutionary distances between vaccine strains and IBV field strains in China (Liu et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2014). Despite the widespread use of live attenuated IBV vaccine (mass serotype), such as strains H120, H52, and Ma5, vaccinated chicken flocks usually fail to achieve complete protection against field virulent IBV challenge. The poultry industry has, in recent years, detected an increasing incidence of outbreaks related to QX-like IBV strains of different serotypes in many countries (Abro et al., 2012, Terregino et al., 2008, Valastro et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2007). Optimal vaccines against circulating IBV strains in China require attenuated vaccines designed from local strains in China. A previous IBV isolate (the YN strain) was passaged 118 times through SPF chicken embryonated eggs. As a result of this process, the virus becomes more adapted to the embryo, reflected by more efficient replication and higher pathogenicity for the embryo (data not shown). This attenuated YN strain was inoculated via the oral or oculonasal route into SPF chickens to compare the tissue tropism and pathogenicity to its parent strain.",

These lesions appeared to damage the host cell, leading to the loss of cellular functions and decreasing immunity, increasing the opportunities for secondary or multiple infections (Davies et al., 2009).

We also observed that the viral RNA levels in the tracheas of birds in both groups declined after the peak, then reached another small peak. Loss of ciliated columnar epithelium, and, presumably, the associated viral replication in those cells, is a common lesion with IBV infection (Callison et al., 2006, Geerligs et al., 2011).

Besides the S1 subunit, the nucleocapsid protein can also induce protective immune responses in chickens(Boots et al., 1992). Previous studies have shown that amino acid substitutions within the replicase gene may result in attenuation following serial passage in embryonated eggs (Armesto et al., 2009). Further genetic investigation will be necessary to determine the key mutations responsible for the attenuation in this sample.
