Of the 71 taxonomically defined virus families, 24 contain members that infect vertebrates, and these families will be the focus of this overview. Among the smallest vertebrate viruses, the virion consists only of the viral genome and a closely associated protein coat (nucleocapsid), whereas larger viruses possess, in addition to the nucleocapsid, a variety of catalytic, regulatory and structural proteins, and in some cases a host-derived lipid membrane (envelope) containing one or more virus-encoded glycoproteins. In animal cells, virus replication is complete within several hours to at most a few days, and results in the synthesis of 103\u2013105 virions per cell. Virus replication will be discussed in three stages: (1) early events (attachment to susceptible cells, penetration and uncoating), (2) viral biosynthetic events (replication of the viral genome, transcription and translation) and (3) virion assembly. However, because of space limitations, early events and mechanisms of virion assembly will be dealt with briefly so that viral biosynthetic strategies can be considered in greater detail.",

Because of the specificity of this interaction, the host range (tropism) of a given virus is determined primarily by the presence of viral receptor molecules on the cell surface. As a group, viruses utilize a variety of proteins, lipids and oligosaccharides as receptors. One class of receptors includes cellular macromolecules involved in ligand binding, endocytosis and cell recognition. For example, the receptors for poliovirus, human rhinovirus (ICAM-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (CD4) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (CD21) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. In contrast, the receptor for Mahoney leukemia virus is an amino acid transporter and sialic acid-containing glycoproteins serve as receptors for paramyxo- and orthomyxoviruses.",

            "text": "Following attachment, the virion must enter the cell (penetration) and release its genome (uncoating).\nThe process by which many viruses accomplish this dual task is termed receptor-mediated endocytosis and is the same mechanism used by the cell to import growth factors and other large molecules to which the plasma membrane is not permeable. Virions, bound to their cognate receptors, are transported laterally within the plasma membrane to clathrin-coated pits and enter the cell as the clathrin-coated pit invaginates. Subsequently, this vesicle fuses with an endosome and, within this acidic compartment, uncoating takes place. The acidic pH of the endosome is critical and agents that raise the intraendosomal pH (e.g. NH4Cl, chloroquine, etc.) block virus uncoating.\nFor enveloped viruses, uncoating involves fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane followed by release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. In the case of influenza virus, it is thought that low pH changes the conformation of the hemagglutinin (HA) allowing the hydrophobic fusion peptide to interact with target cell membranes. In addition, among negative-stranded viruses, the acidic environment within the endosome promotes release of the matrix (M) protein from the nucleocapsid, a step necessary for subsequent transcription. Nonenveloped viruses also appear to utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis, although here uncoating does not involve membrane\u2013membrane fusion. For example, following attachment of poliovirus to target cells, one of the capsid proteins (VP4) is released exposing hydrophobic residues buried inside the virion. Interaction of these residues with the endosomal membrane may provide a pore through which viral RNA is extruded into the cytoplasm. In the adenovirus system, low endosomal pH induces conformational changes in the capsid which rupture the endosomal membrane at virion\u2013membrane contact points. After its release into the cytoplasm, adenovirus is transported via microtubules to nuclear pores where viral DNA enters the nucleus. In contrast to the above mechanism, several viruses (e.g. paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV]) do not require an acidic environment for uncoating and enter cells by fusion at the plasma membrane.",

In subsequent steps, the retroviral cDNA is integrated into the host chromosome and transcribed by host-encoded DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (pol II) to yield viral messages and genomic RNA.\nDNA viruses, except for poxviruses, also use host-encoded pol II to transcribe their messages. Poxviruses, because they replicate in the cytoplasm and do not have access to pol II, assemble a novel transcriptase composed of multiple poxvirus-specific (and possibly one or more host-derived) subunits. Most DNA virus families (e.g. Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae) synthesize a virus-encoded DNA-dependent, DNA polymerase.

            "text": "Viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to control gene expression and maximize efficiency. In some systems, viral gene expression is divided into temporal phases in which catalytic and regulatory proteins are synthesized early in infection, whereas the synthesis of structural proteins is limited to late times. Alternatively, the expression of viral genes may be controlled by differences in the transcription rate of specific genes (e.g. rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses), the translational efficiency of different viral messages (e.g. reovirus) or the replication of transcriptional templates (e.g. influenza virus). Moreover, it is likely that, even within a single virus family, multiple mechanisms regulate gene expression. At the molecular level, gene expression is controlled by both cis- and trans-acting signals. In some cases, the nucleotide sequence of viral messages and transcriptional templates may be the primary factor in determining how efficiently a given sequence is translated or transcribed. For example, the differential synthesis of the various coronavirus mRNAs is thought to be controlled by interaction between trans-acting coronavirus leader RNA and cis-acting sequences located at the beginning of each gene. Furthermore, transcription and genome replication among DNA viruses (and retroviruses) is regulated by the (often) combined action of trans-acting viral- and host-encoded factors with cis-acting viral nucleotide sequences. For example, herpesvirus immediate-early gene transcription requires, aside from pol II, both host- (OTF-1) and virus-encoded (\u03b1-TIF) transcription factors. Lastly, in several families (e.g. Orthomyxoviridae, Poxviridae, Herpesviridae and Iridoviridae), there are hints that viral gene expression is also regulated at post-transcriptional and translational levels.",

Viral mRNAs are monocistronic and are translated as are other eucaryotic transcripts. However, in some systems, viral proteins are synthesized as part of a larger precursor (polyprotein) which is cleaved to generate the final products. This mechanism overcomes the inability of eucaryotic ribosomes to translate polycistronic messages and allows one viral mRNA to code for several proteins.\nViruses have also developed several ways to utilize the same nucleotide sequence to encode one or more proteins: 1.HIV-1 and influenza A virus use alternative splicing to generate additional transcripts encoding novel proteins;2.\nmeasles virus and other paramyxoviruses generate a novel P-related protein (V) by RNA editing, a process in which one or more nontemplated nucleotides are added at a site within the 3\u2032 end of some P transcripts;3.Sendai virus synthesizes five proteins from its P transcript by using alternative translational initiation codons;4.\nretroviruses use frameshifting or read-through mechanisms to circumvent a stop codon lying between the capsid and polymerase coding regions of the gag-pol transcript.\n",

Alternatively, virus infection may actively inhibit host translation by (1) proteolytically inactivating or covalently modifying initiation factors required solely or preferentially by cellular messages, (2) selectively degrading host messages, or (3) altering the intracellular ionic environment to favor viral over host translation. Furthermore, because infection can lead to the phosphorylation and functional inactivation of eucaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), several virus families (Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Adenoviridae and Picornaviridae) have evolved mechanisms to block eIF-2 phosphorylation. Virus infection also blocks host cell RNA and DNA synthesis.

Subsequent cleavages, catalyzed by viral protease 3C, yield structural (capsid) and catalytic (polymerase) proteins.

In contrast, viral messages, which are uncapped and possess a highly structured 5\u2032-nontranslated region (5\u2032-NTR), escape shut-off because the 40S ribosomal subunit binds to an internal sequence within the 5\u2032-NTR.\nThe ability of the 40S ribosomal subunit to bind internally, in contrast to the usual scenario in which the 40S ribosome binds at the 5\u2032 end of the message and \u2018scans\u2019 until a start codon is encountered, is termed \u2018internal ribosome entry\u2019.

Immediately after uncoating, the VSV genome is transcribed to yield a short nontranslated \u2018leader\u2019 RNA followed, in decreasing molar amounts, by five capped, methylated and polyadenylated viral mRNAs. Transcription occurs within the nucleocapsid, a structure containing the viral genome and multiple copies of three virus-encoded proteins. Aside from the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which tightly encloses the genome and is present in \u223c2000 copies/nucleocapsid, two catalytic proteins are also present within the nucleocapsid. The polymerase, polypeptide L (mol. wt \u223c200000), is present in about 50 copies per nucleocapsid and catalyzes transcriptional initiation and elongation, as well as capping, methylation and polyadenylation. The phosphoprotein P, present in about 500 molecules per nucleocapsid, plays a variety of roles in RNA synthesis. It binds L to the nucleocapsid, maintains the solubility of free N and may function in chain elongation. The viral transcriptase binds genomic RNA at its 3\u2032 terminus and initiates transcription.\nAt each intergenic junction (with the exception of the leader-N junction), a poly (A) tract is added to the newly synthesized mRNA by repetitive copying (\u2018stuttering\u2019) of an oligo (U) sequence present at the end of the gene. After synthesis of the poly (A) tract, transcription terminates, releasing newly synthesized mRNA, but maintaining the transcriptase on its template. Re-initiation at the next gene downstream occurs via a conserved start sequence present at the beginning of each gene.

REV mediates the switch between the synthesis of regulatory proteins (i.e. TAT and REV) and the generation of structural and catalytic proteins by binding to cis-acting sequences within viral mRNA and directing the transport into the cytoplasm of unspliced genomic RNA and singly-spliced envelope message.",

However, even in these two families, viral mRNA is ultimately transcribed from a dsDNA template using cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 1). In place of a detailed discussion of each family, broader issues of viral DNA replication will be discussed. To begin with, DNA viruses differ greatly in their genetic content ranging in size from 5 kbp (Parvoviridae) to greater than 120 kbp (Herpesviridae, Poxviridae and Iridoviridae). Thus the small DNA viruses are about as genetically complex as a typical RNA virus, whereas the larger DNA viruses encode 100 or more proteins. Not unexpectedly, the degree to which virus replication is dependent on cellular functions reflects the genetic complexity of the virus. Thus, parvoviruses and papovaviruses require extensive host involvement to support viral biosynthetic events (including DNA synthesis), whereas other families are progressively more independent.",

Generally immediate early genes code for proteins required to initiate virus replication, early genes encode catalytic functions (e.g. the viral DNA polymerase), and late genes specify structural proteins. Furthermore, immediate early genes activate early and late gene transcription, whereas specific early and late genes downregulate immediate early and early gene expression respectively. Aside from specific regulatory proteins, full late gene expression also requires viral DNA synthesis, thus inhibitors of viral DNA replication block late gene expression despite the presence of functional immediate early and early activators.",

For example, adenoviruses solve the \u2018end-problem\u2019 by using a nucleotide-linked terminal protein to initiate DNA replication, herpesviruses replicate through a rolling circle mechanism, and poxviruses and parvoviruses utilize a self-priming mechanism to ensure replication of their termini. In contrast to other DNA viruses, hepadnaviruses possess a circular, partially single-stranded DNA genome that is replicated through an RNA intermediate using virus-encoded reverse transcriptase. Upon entry into the cell the gaps are repaired and dsDNA is transcribed in the nucleus by host polymerase to yield viral mRNAs and pregenomic RNA. The latter is encapsidated and transcribed into complementary DNA using virus-encoded protein P both as the primer and the reverse transcriptase. As with retroviruses, the RNA template is degraded and second-strand DNA synthesis takes place. However, before its completion, the virion is exported from the cell leaving genomic DNA partially single-stranded.",

Despite the large number of vertebrate virus families, only three types of nucleocapsids are found: complex, helical and icosahedral (spherical). The nucleocapsids of poxviruses do not conform to the geometric symmetry found among the helical and icosahedral viruses and are considered to be \u2018complex\u2019. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling their assembly.\nHelical nucleocapsids (which, among vertebrate viruses, enclose only RNA genomes) form as viral proteins bind to nascent RNA transcripts and encapsidate them. During virus assembly, helical nucleocapsids migrate to cellular membranes where viral glycoproteins have concentrated. There, through concerted interaction between the nucleocapsid and viral glycoproteins, the nucleocapsid is enveloped by the cellular membrane in a process termed \u2018budding\u2019. Host proteins are excluded from the membrane and the resulting envelope contains only virus-encoded glycoproteins.\nMoreover, because envelopment is not a precise process, dual infections with different strains of the same multipartite virus (e.g. influenza virus A) lead to high-frequency genetic reassortment. Although virion envelopment takes place commonly at the plasma membrane (e.g. among the Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae), intracellular membranes (e.g. those of the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and, in the case of DNA viruses, the nucleus) are used by other virus families.\nIn contrast to viruses with helical nucleocapsids, icosahedral nucleocapsids enclose both DNA and RNA genomes. It is thought that nucleocapsids form spontaneously when the concentration of capsid proteins reaches a critical level. In some families, nucleocapsids are not enveloped (i.e. virion equals nucleocapsid), whereas in others nucleocapsids are enveloped as described above. Enveloped icosahedral viruses are released from infected cells by budding, whereas non-enveloped icosahedral virions are liberated by cell lysis.",
