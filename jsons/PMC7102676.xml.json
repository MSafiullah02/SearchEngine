The nation that invests in biomedical research will reap untold rewards in its economy and the health of its people\u201d (Collins, 2015). This assertion reflects optimism on two fronts: that better characterization of disease will lead to more effective and safer use of current treatments for common long-term medical disorders; and that new biomedical technology and expertise will accelerate development of improved treatments or new treatments where none currently exist. Of particular interest are new approaches to currently refractory cancers, resolving acquired resistance to cancer chemotherapy and resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy, the ability to deal rapidly with epidemic viral diseases such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), and MERS (Miiddle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), developing disease-modifying treatment for rare inherited diseases, and improving treatment for endemic infections in the developing world for which current treatments are toxic, poorly effective, or not available.",

            "text": "A study of the Sentinel database to assess links between dabigatran and bleeding risk illustrates some of the challenges to use of the data. Dabigatran was licensed as an orally active alternative to reducing risk of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation due to nonvalvular causes. RE-LY, the initial RCT, indicated that dabigatran was better than warfarin at preventing stroke, with similar overall bleeding risk (Connolly et al., 2009). Following the market authorization for dabigatran, the FDA received an expectedly large number of reports of serious bleeding episodes associated with the drug. This was interpreted as possibly due to underreporting about bleeding due to the much older drug warfarin and overreporting for the new drug dabigatran. Other possible reasons included inability to obtain sufficient personal data on individuals featured in the ADR reports, including for details of patient populations, comorbidity, concurrent medications, drug dose and whether it had been adjusted for renal function (Southworth et al., 2013). The Sentinel database suggested that in fact, as in the RE-LY RCT, bleeding risk from intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhages for dabigatran was similar to that from warfarin (Southworth et al., 2013). However, the authors of the Sentinel report noted that its limitations also included lack of adjustment for some key variables, including confounding by indication for the treatment (Freemantle et al., 2013), and lack of validation about whether an insurance claim code reflected an actual bleeding episode (Southworth et al., 2013). Further analyses are planned to aim to adjust as far as possible for these key factors.",

Thus, a patient's drug transporter profile may be useful in predicting treatment response (Zair et al., 2008), as well as risk of adverse effects from treatments of cancer, and a wide range of other therapeutic classes. For instance, increased OATP1B1 protein levels are seen in tumors of the colon, endometrium, esophagus, lung, prostate, stomach, testis, and bladder, and genetic variation both in OATP1B1 and in OATP1B3 contribute to the in vitro cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells (Svoboda et al., 2011). OATP1B1 genetic variants were also associated with increased irinotecan-induced treatment response and survival in colorectal cancer patients in a prospective multicenter study (Huang et al., 2013). Regarding efflux transporters, SNPs in genes expressing ABCB1 multidrug resistance protein variants have been related to substrate and inhibitor-dependent functional modifications in in vitro studies and reduced expression in tissues. Furthermore, ABCB1 proteins have been shown to have a potent ability to interact with numerous clinically important kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, gefitinib, and erlotinib, conferring cancer treatment resistance (Gong and Kim, 2013, Ozvegy-Laczka et al., 2004, Shi et al., 2007, Sugimoto et al., 2005).",

Statins are well-recognized to reduce the incidence and severity of ischaemic heart disease and atheromatous vascular complications in the brain and other circulations by inhibiting the key rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis HMG CoA reductase (Goldstein & Brown, 1990), and by upregulation of LDL receptors to increase cholesterol scavenging (Ma et al., 1986). However, statins also have important pleiotropic actions (Koh et al., 2011, Liao and Laufs, 2005), independent of their lipid-lowering properties. These pleiotropic actions may contribute both to the cardiovascular benefits of statins and to their adverse effects. For example, direct (Hauck et al., 2007, Hermida et al., 2013, Rajtik et al., 2012, Thuc et al., 2010, Zheng and Hu, 2005) and indirect evidence (Jenkins et al., 1996, Ozawa et al., 2009) in experimental models and in patients suggests that beneficial effects of statins may include improving cardiac function by effects independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects, by modulating a range of signaling pathways, including mitigation of apoptosis (Rajtik et al., 2012).",

New chemical genomic methods allow unrecognized pleiotropic beneficial and harmful targets for medicines to be identified. If these targets are genetically variable in their expression, potentially beneficial drugs might be made available to selected patients who do not have the high-risk genotype(s) and phenotype(s). Magic Tag\u00ae is an example of technology for new target discovery through allowing immobilization of bioactive molecules coupled with bacteriophage display, followed by an ELISA assay, to test for interactions of drugs with new putative protein targets (Dilly et al., 2007, Ladwa et al., 2008). Using these methods, an alternative initiation of translation was exemplified for flecainide as a potential toxicity factor by showing its binding to protein products of genes linked to sudden cardiac death (Taylor, Clark, Marsh, Singer, & Dilly, 2013).",

These growth receptors may be 100 times overexpressed in cancer cells. The first Companion Diagnostic was the HercepTest, an immunohistochemistry assay to detect HER2 (Gijsen et al., 2010) receptor positive breast cancers (Hurvitz et al., 2012, Slamon et al., 2011, Stern et al., 2015). Trastuzumab was developed as an antibody against HER2. It binds to domain IV of the extracellular segment of the receptor, leading to reduced cell proliferation due to arrest of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Le, Pruefer, & Bast, 2005). Mechanisms for this include activation of the tumor suppressor p27 through inhibiting at least six major intracellular signaling pathways (Le et al., 2005). Trastuzumab also inhibits angiogenesis (Banerjee, Dowsett, Ashworth, & Martin, 2007), attributable in part to reduction in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reduced activity of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway (Kou et al., 2007, Le et al., 2005). Use of trastuzumab to treat breast cancer is conditional on the HER2 companion diagnostic test confirming that a breast cancer expresses EGF receptor 2. Around ~ 30% of breast cancer patients express EGF receptor 2 and thus may benefit from this biological drug. The HER2 test was approved in 1999 by the FDA (Roche & Ingle, 1999), and then by NICE (Crabb et al., 2012) and other regulatory agencies, as a companion diagnostic for use with trastuzumab as the companion therapeutic agent: the first example of formal regulatory licensing of a companion diagnostic.",

This provided the opportunity for developing both new diagnostics and selective drugs to target the resulting mutation. This has been identified as an enzyme with tyrosine kinase activity resulting from fusion of part of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene from chromosome 22 with the abl gene on chromosome 9 (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2009). The fused Bcr-Abl protein is continuously active and is coupled to the interleukin 3 beta(c) receptor subunit, increasing cell turnover and impairing DNA repair (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2009). Imatinib was developed as the first clinically effective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor (TKI) for treating patients with CML who are positive for the BCR-ABL1 mutation (Hochhaus et al., 2009, Hughes et al., 2010, O'Brien et al., 2003). The disease commonly proceeds to an accelerated phase and then to a blast crisis with very poor clinical outcome. The International Randomized Study of Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) trial of untreated CML in chronic phase assessed benefits of randomization to imatinib (n\n = 553) versus interferon-alpha plus cytarabine (n\n = 553) (Hochhaus et al., 2009). In a 6-year update from IRIS in patients receiving imatinib as first-line therapy, there were no reports of disease progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis (Hochhaus et al., 2009). The estimated event-free survival at 6 years was 83%, with a 93% estimated rate of freedom from progression to accelerated phase and then to a blast crisis; estimated overall survival was 88%, 95% survival for CML-related deaths (Hochhaus et al., 2009).",

Evidence from a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in 46 subjects suggests that it is an effective adjuvant therapy for manic episodes of bipolar mood disorder without psychotic features. Patients with raised cortisol and inflammatory markers have a poorer response to treatment of a first psychosis (Mondelli et al., 2015). Raison et al. conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of three infusions of the TNF-alpha antagonist infliximab in 60 outpatients with major depression either on a stable antidepressant regimen (n\n = 37) or medication free (n\n = 23) for 4 weeks or more and were moderately resistant to treatment (Raison et al., 2013). Infliximab was infused at 5 mg/kg at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks of a 12-week study. There was no overall effect of the treatment on depression scores. However, baseline concentrations of TNF and its soluble receptors were significantly higher in infliximab-treated clinical responders versus nonresponders. Furthermore, patients with the highest level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were most likely to response to the anti-TNF-alpha treatment (Raison et al., 2013) and to have significantly greater decreases in hs-CRP from baseline to week 12 versus placebo-treated responders.",

Finding these pleiotropic benefit and risk targets allows multiple indications for new drugs, the opportunity to reprofile use of existing drugs for which safety profiles in other contexts are already established, and to predict potential adverse effects of treatments. The concept of network pharmacology (Hopkins, 2008) arises from the observation that many drugs share the same type of ADR-causing mechanism and that many drugs share similar therapeutic effects (Janga and Tzakos, 2009, Pujol et al., 2010). These beneficial or adverse effects may be through actions on known or hidden targets, which may be unmasked through considering networks of known disease mechanisms and known drug targets (Fig. 3\n), complemented by discovery work in silico and using a wide range of \u201comic,\u201d chemical biology (Taylor et al., 2013), pharmacology, and clinical methods (Watkins, Marsh, Taylor, & Singer, 2010).",
