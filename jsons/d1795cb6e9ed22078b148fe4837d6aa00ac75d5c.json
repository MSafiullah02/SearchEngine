            "text": "The Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019, has fast spread throughout the globe with nearly 200 countries affected [1] . The relatively easy spread of this virus combined with the higher morbidity and mortality of symptomatic infection as compared to influenza have resulted in overwhelmed hospital systems in China, Italy, and the United States, to name just a few [2, 3] . As a result, elective medical care has been necessarily de-prioritized to meet the demands of this public health crisis. In the face of this unprecedented situation, a rational framework to adjudicate patient prioritization in the context of severely constrained resources is urgently needed [4] . There have been some guidelines recently promulgated by the American College of Surgeons based on surgical acuity that are generally sound [5] . Similarly, a recent article by Burke et al. articulated an approach towards case prioritization for neurosurgical cases specifically [6] . In addition, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) guidelines list neurosurgery and most cancers as Tier 3a cases and as such recommend that these cases not be postponed if possible given their high acuity [7] . Neuro-oncology cases are unique in that the brain or spine tumors which may not be urgent now will become urgent in due course. For malignant Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors, this time course will likely occur in the near future when the Coronavirus pandemic may still be ongoing. Here, we present a framework to assist in determining case priorities in patients with neuro-oncologic disease. We divide the framework between Resource-Constrained (Some hospital resources available for non-COVID disease) and No Resource settings(All hospital resources directed towards COVID patients).",

To the extent possible, patients and health providers should be given access to their providers through telemedicine appointments. Given the importance of imaging in neuro-oncology patients for diagnosis and surveillance, it is critical that outpatient radiology remain accessible for patients and providers. Radiology and radiation oncology centers should establish protocols to limit patients in waiting areas and provide masks for patients. Finally, for those patients requiring infusions, patients should be appropriately separated with masks given. Ill patients should, of course, remain home and home health care including infusions at home should be considered. For ill patients that are COVID+, discussions between patient and provider should occur to discuss whether their treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) can be reasonably postponed until recovery. If it cannot, appropriate evaluation and treatment of these patients should occur in isolated settings with staff provided the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).",

For example, a patient who tests positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic, should delay their procedure until their infection clears given risks to care providers and other hospitalized patients. Procedures in COVID-19 positive patients should be done only for true emergencies. We recommend that to the extent possible, preoperative testing or labwork be performed on the day of surgery for outpatients to minimize patient exposure to hospital settings. Patients with significant cytopenias from their cancers or their therapies should be evaluated in detail to determine whether a surgical intervention is advisable, given their potential poor ability to recover from a hospital acquired COVID-infection.",

For patients who do not require surgery, radiation therapy in the form of either radiosurgery or whole brain radiation therapy should be offered at the discretion of the treating providers. Radiation therapy departments should establish protocols to minimize patient flow and provide masks to patients for use during clinical care.

For example, pituitary tumors or skull base lesions with rapidly worsening vision should receive treatment (more chronic vision loss cases can and will likely need to be delayed). Similarly, acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, etc. with hydrocephalus or other symptoms of brainstem compression should be managed expeditiously. Tumors associated with slow but progressive symptoms should be evaluated on a case by case basis. These decisions can adjudicated fairly by departments and resource allocation panels based on available hospital resources and patient needs across the hospital system.
