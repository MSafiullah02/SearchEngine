In the Mediterranean basin, Leishmania infantum (the only species present in Italy) is transmitted by dipteran insects of the genus Phlebotomus. Phlebotomus perniciosus is the most widespread sandfly plebotomine in Italy [1], [2]. Although domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are the main reservoirs of infection, the Leishmania parasite is the causative agent of both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniosis in humans [3]. Both in dogs and in humans, leishmaniosis varies in clinical presentation from focal cutaneous disease to disseminated visceralizing disease, and in severity from nonsymptomatic to fatal.",

This increases the importance of investigating the role of cats in the urban cycle of leishmaniosis and the role of cats as sources for disease transmission. Because stray cats are constantly exposed to vectors of infection and do not receive any kind of prophylactic treatment, they can be used as sentinels for the presence of infection in a given geographic area [10]. Leishmania can infect apparently healthy cats, and the infection may persist, with no clinical manifestations [11], [12]. Therefore, positive epidemiologic studies could identify new outbreaks in areas previously identified as free of leishmaniosis. The lack of epidemiologic data regarding leishmaniosis raises important public health considerations with respect to the disease's zoonotic potential and has implications for those who wish to safeguard the health of owned cats and dogs within in the same area. Such data would be useful in implementing measures designed to prevent the spread of infection.",

Univariate analysis of categorical data was performed to determine possible associations between L. infantum positivity and the following variables: sex, age, colony of origin, BCS, clinical and dermatologic examination results, and seropositivity for FIV, FeLV, FCoV, C. felis, B. henselae, or T. gondii infection. The significance of differences was assessed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Any statistically significant associations were subsequently evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Associations were described using a probability (P) value < 0.05 as statistically significant and odds ratio (OR). Analyses were carried out using MedCalc statistical software (version 12.3.0; Mariakerke, Belgium).",

This is the second study to examine stray cats from the city of Milan for L. infantum infection. A previous study [22] reported a seropositivity of 6.4% for L. infantum at titers \u22651:80 (15 seropositive out of 233 cats tested) in stray colony cats, in contrast to the total negativity of blood samples analyzed by rPCR. Seropositivity for L. infantum was re-evaluated 4 years later in the present study in a similar population of stray cats in order to take advantage of the increased diagnostic sensitivity of newer PCR techniques for the identification of L. infantum in whole blood, lymph node aspirates, and oculoconjunctival samples. In the present study, 2.2% of the cats examined were positive for the presence of Leishmania DNA (2 cats), and 30.0% of the cats (27 of 90) were seroreactive by IFAT. Of these 90 cats, 11 (12.2%) had an antibody titer of 1:80, considered the cut-off for diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats [19], [20]. The seroprevalence of L. infantum infection had therefore doubled from that previously reported. This increase could be related to the presence of a focally endemic area for leishmaniosis in Milan.",

            "text": "The present study adds new data regarding the epidemiology of feline infections such as C. felis, which, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, has never been studied in this feline population in Milan. In the present study, the seroprevalence of C. felis infection (17.1%) was slightly lower than that reported by a previous study, which found a seroprevalence of 21% in a population of 86 free-living feral cats tested in the Veneto region of northern Italy between 1997 and 2000 [34]. Results of a survey of C. felis infection could be useful in deciding what prophylactic vaccination strategies to recommend for owned cats sharing territory with stray cats. The present results also provide updated data regarding the prevalence of infections in stray cats in Milan with other important agents, such as retroviruses, T. gondii, and B. henselae. The seroprevalence of infection with B. henselae (17.1%), the causative agent of cat-scratch disease in humans, was similar to that reported by a previous study (16.1%) involving 87 stray cats in Milan, conducted in 1999\u20132000 [35]. The prevalence of FIV infection in stray cats in Milan was similar (6.1%) to that reported by a previous study performed by the same authors in 2006\u20132008 [36], in which 6.6% of the cats surveyed tested positive for infection with this retrovirus. The absence of an increase in the prevalence of FIV infection in this population could be associated with the TNR program, which has been conducted for many years in Milan to control the stray feline population. The neutering of stray cats may reduce aggressive sexual behavior, the primary mechanism of FIV transmission. Conversely, the seroprevalence of FeLV infection has almost doubled, increasing from 3.8% in the previous study [36] to 6.1% in the present study. FeLV transmission is facilitated by \u2018friendly\u2019 behavior, and unfortunately, the advantages offered by vaccination of the majority of the feline population are not available to the stray cats of Milan. The seroprevalence of IgG specific for T. gondii (29.3%) was similar to that found in the previous survey in this population (30.5%) [36].",
