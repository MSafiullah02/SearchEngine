Fundoscopic examination by a registered veterinary ophthalmology specialist identified patchy chorioretinitis in both retinas. These changes were considered consistent with protozoal chorioretinitis, but it was felt they were not severe enough to cause blindness. Toxoplasma serology was run, and IgG was positive at 1:1024, and IgM was positive at 1:128. Treatment was initiated with prednisolone (Delta-Cortef; Upjohn) 0.8 mg/kg q 12 h and clindamycin (Antirobe; Pfizer) 25 mg/kg q 12 h. Within 3 days, the cat\u2019s vision returned, and the cat remained clinically normal for approximately 1 month. The prednisolone dosage was decreased to q 24 h after 2 weeks, and q 48 h after 4 weeks. Within 2 weeks of discontinuing the prednisolone, the cat was represented to the referring veterinary surgeon with blindness and severe lethargy. At that time, the cat was referred to Melbourne University Veterinary Hospital.",

The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is also involved in thirst detection, and is located inside the blood\u2013brain barrier, but is not considered part of the circumventricular organ system.
