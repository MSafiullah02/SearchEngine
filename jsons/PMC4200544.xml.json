            "text": "Despite the enormous investment in critical care resources, severe sepsis mortality ranges from 28% to 50% or greater. Moreover, cases of severe sepsis are expected to rise in the future for several reasons, including: Increased awareness and sensitivity for the diagnosis; increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients; wider use of invasive procedures; more resistant microorganisms; and an aging population[1] Definitions for the terms of \u201cSIRS\u201d, \u201csepsis\u201d, \u201csevere sepsis\u201d or \u201cseptic shock\u201d have been proposed by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference in 1992, and are now widely used. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) encompasses a variety of complex findings that result from systemic activation of the innate immune response. The clinical parameters include two or more the following: Fever (>38\u00b0 C) or hypothermia (<36\u00b0 C), increased heart rate (>90 beats/min), tachypnea (>20 breaths/min) or hyperventilation (PaCO2 < 32 mmHg), and altered white blood cell count (>12,000 cells/mm3 or <4000 cells/mm3) or presence of >10% immature neutrophils. Sepsis is defined as SIRS resulting from infection, whether of bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic origin. Severe sepsis is associated with at least one acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension[23]",

Moreover, microbiological cultures; the conventional gold standard diagnostic method for sepsis, are often time consuming do not reflect the host response of systemic inflammation or the onset of organ dysfunction, and sometimes misleading with false positive or false negative reports. These shortcomings in both culture and available blood tests have driven researchers to find other more sensitive and specific markers. In recent years, PCT has been the focus of much attention as a specific and early marker for systemic inflammation, infection, and sepsis, both in children and adults[34]",

The half-life of PCT is approximately 24 hours; therefore, concentrations normalize fairly quickly with the patient's recovery. In comparison, CRP takes 12-24 hours to rise and remains elevated for up to 3 to 7 days. Because PCT concentrations increase earlier and normalize more rapidly than CRP, PCT has the potential advantage of earlier disease diagnosis, as well as better monitoring of disease progression.[9] Moreover, a number of studies have shown that the systematic use of PCT for sepsis diagnosis and monitoring may also have a positive impact on the reduction of antibiotic (AB) treatment, therefore allowing a shorter stay in the ICU and lower costs per case. This will also be beneficial in combating the increase of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms which is mainly related to the excess use of antibiotics.[10111213] Additionally, researchers found a \u226530% decrease in PCT levels between days 2 and 3 to be an independent predictor of survival in ICU patients.[14]",

Karlsson et al.[18] also reported of significantly higher PCT levels in positive culture cases compared to that of the negative ones. In our observation, both PCT and CRP levels were higher in cases with positive cultures though statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). In another Korean study the higher CRP levels associated with positive cultures showed greater statistical significance (P < 0.001) than PCT levels (P < 0.05).[20]",

In this study PCT showed highest level of accuracy (75.34%) with greater specificity (72.2%), positive and negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratio as well as the smaller negative likelihood ratio. However, sensitivity of CRP in the diagnosis of sepsis was found to be higher (85.45%) than PCT (76.36%). By convention, marked changes in prior disease probability can be assumed in PLR exceeding 10.0 and NLR below 0.1[29] Procalcitonin had a higher PLR and lower NLR than did CRP and complement proteins. These results are in agreement with those of Clec\u2019h et al.[28], Ruiz-Alvarez et al.[22] and others.[252627]",
