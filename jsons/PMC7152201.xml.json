The consistency of the feces is liquid, or pastelike, adapting to the form of its receptacle. The frequency and volume of the excretions can be seen to increase within a highly variable range, starting with very slight diarrhea up to that which can put the patient's life at risk. The volume of feces in a healthy adult is almost 300 ml. Diarrhea's pathogenic mechanism is responsible for an acceleration of intestinal transit.",

Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene.\u201d Dr. Sherwood L.

Main symptoms usually remain for less than 7 days (but can persist up to 2 weeks at most); it can be accompanied by vomiting and fever, but it also presents a greater problem, the possibility of dehydration. It is a result of the alteration of absorption and secretion balance. Causal agents include rotavirus, Campylobacter, nontyphoidal Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and so on.b.Dysentery: When diarrhea is accompanied by visible traces of blood in the feces, it is called dysentery. It is a result of damage suffered by intestinal mucus in the colon ravaged by an external agent, such as Shigella dysenteriae, nontyphoidal Salmonella, Entamoeba histolytica, and Campylobacter. Rapid weight loss is the most frequent consequence.c.Persistent diarrhea: With a duration of more than 14 days, it can start as acute diarrhea or dysentery. It should not be confused with chronic diarrhea due to noninfectious causes. It can produce noticeable weight loss and a risk of dehydration. Causal agents include Shigella, enteroaggregative E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia.\n",

Among the defense mechanisms combating infectious agents, the following can be highlighted: gastric acid, gastrointestinal mucus, intestinal motility, bile salts, regular intestinal bacteria, macrophage cells, lymphocyte cells, and type IgA immunoglobulin in the mucus. Additionally, there are genetic factors that can affect resistance to particular infections; for example, blood group \u2018O\u2019 individuals are at greater risk of suffering from cholera, whereas the so-called nonsecretory individuals, with certain FUT 2 gene mutations, are partially resistant to norovirus infection. Other specific external circumstances such as the ingestion of alcohol or (nonvolatile) red wine could act as protective factors against infection by Salmonella when the ingestion of the microorganism and those kind of drinks is almost simultaneous. There are few vaccines effective against diarrheal diseases. Recently, a vaccine against rotavirus has been authorized, which is expected to show positive results.",

Certain parasites and cholera, for example (of whom the WHO is continuously in international pursuit), are still frequent in some underdeveloped regions where favorable conditions for their propagation exist. Bad conditions of individual hygiene, nutrition, and existing public sanitation in many poor countries favor the presence of diarrhea. Even when incidences of the infection do not display such great geographic differences, in the case of some viruses, the indicators in terms of its lethality are noticeably different; for example, rotavirus is very frequent in all types of countries, but its severity (mortality rate) is greater in poor countries.

Faced with a similar clinical profile, a child does not have the same probability as an adult of receiving an etiological diagnosis: in the child's case it is more likely. The same happens with serious conditions in comparison to slight ones. The slight diarrheas often go without etiological diagnosis. This is also the case with conditions caused by agents that are not detected by the laboratory participating in the analysis. Age bias, age, and technical ability need to be considered when analyzing epidemiological statistics. However, epidemiological studies were performed in England and Holland at the end of 1990s and in the United States in 2001 and 2002, in which a thorough fecal examination of all patients was undertaken, independent of their age and the seriousness of their condition, including those patients who no longer showed symptoms of diarrhea. In these studies, fecal examination was also carried out in healthy control subjects, so that the frequency in which specific microorganisms appeared could be compared with asymptomatic subjects.",

Specialized laboratories can use more complex techniques that, generally, prove to be more sensitive and specific, but are also more expensive and difficult. Nevertheless, many of the coprocultures a standard laboratory requests and examines are negative. A negative result can be the consequence of the following reasons: diarrhea is not actually infectious, it is caused by an agent for which the laboratory has no data, there is a failure in the test sensitivity, the patient may have taken antibiotics, or there may have been problems in fecal transport. Cases that have returned negative results are a mixture of etiologies, and for that reason further investigation makes little sense. In the EDICS study (Study of Infectious Diarrhea in Castell\u00f3n) of risk factors in infantile diarrhea, no risk factors were found associated to the cases with a negative fecal analysis result. On the contrary, risk factors were found in cases of campylobacteriosis, salmonelosis, or rotavirus. This indeed suggests that the group of negatives is a mixture of different etiological cases without common origin and with few shared risk factors. The appearance of vomit as an initial symptom, the absence of fecal blood (macro- or microscopic,) and low PCR (reactive C protein) are signs suggestive of viral etiology, especially in children.",

On the contrary, Salmonella and, especially, norovirus more characteristically present themselves in the form of outbreaks.

This group of apparently sporadic cases (but which, in fact, are not sporadic) can only be detected by the existence of an exceptionally good monitoring system or by performing specific studies. Steen Ettenberg and other collaborators performed a specific study on cases registered throughout Denmark in the 1990s and found that 13.3% of Salmonella enteritidis, 10.4% of Shigella sonnei, 5.6% of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, 3.2% of Campylobacter, and 2.0% of Yersinia enterocolitica cases belonged to this type of clusters, which is a large majority unknown to epidemiological monitoring systems. In absolute terms, the cases of campylobacteriosis were the most numerous due to the large amount of patients diagnosed with the infection in the last years of the study. In a much smaller study in Castell\u00f3n (Spain), 10 clusters of this type were identified after systematic investigation of coprocultures in an area of 250 000 inhabitants.

First, a defined, open population with a specific exposure, which refers to people who only momentarily shared an exposure factor, for example, attending a shared dinner or banquet. Second, a defined, closed population with lasting exposure factors, for example, permanent residents within a closed institution, who continually share meals, places, and activities. And third, an indefinite population, with or without specific exposure, which occurs when there is no obvious relationship between people and they are implicated in an outbreak, solely by sharing an exposure factor distributed throughout the population. In the case of laboratory analysis, an epidemic is identified where some rare microorganism in unusually large numbers of people is detected in a fairly prolonged time frame. For example, an outbreak that occurred in the United States in the first half of 2008 was produced by Salmonella Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint that affected more than 500 people in 32 states. The epidemic was related to the consumption of tomatoes distributed throughout the country.",
