The Charter was signed on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of the 50 countries. Poland, which was not represented at the Conference, signed later and became one of the original 51 member states. The United Nations came into existence officially on 24 Oct. 1945, with the deposit of the requisite number of ratifications of the Charter with the US Department of State. United Nations Day is celebrated on 24 Oct.",

            "text": "The Charter contains no explicit provisions for peacekeeping operations (PKOs), yet they have the highest profile of all the UN\u2019s operations. PKOs are associated with humanitarian intervention though their emergence was primarily a result of the failure of the Charter\u2019s collective security system during the Cold War and the absence of a UN Force. The end of the Cold War and the rise of intra-state conflict led to a proliferation of PKOs from the late 1980s and a greater proportion of armed missions. However, notable failures in the early and mid-1990s, such as the missions to Somalia in 1993 and to Rwanda in 1994, account for a drop in PKOs and shorter mandates. In 1992 then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali presented the \u2018Agenda for Peace\u2019, which laid out four phases to prevent or end conflict: preventative diplomacy; peacemaking with civilian and military means; peacekeeping, in its traditional sense of operations in the field; and post-conflict peace-building, an area seen as comparatively neglected in previous missions. The then Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a report aimed at conflict prevention in July 2001 emphasizing inter-agency co-operation and long-term strategies to prevent regional instability. There have been 72 peacekeeping operations in total since 1948. The first mission\u2014consisting of unarmed observers\u2014was to monitor the ceasefire during the First Arab\u2013Israeli War.",

Weapons inspectors, led by Hans Blix (Sweden), returned to Iraq four years after their last inspections. Amid suspicion that Iraq was failing to comply, the USA, the UK and Spain reserved the right to disarm Iraq without a further Security Council resolution. Other Council members, notably China, France, Germany and Russia, opposed such action. In April 2003 US forces, supported by the UK, brought an end to Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule. In June 2004 the UN recognized the transfer of sovereignty to the interim government of Iraq. In 2005 the Council referred cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the first time, asking the court to investigate the situation in Darfur, Sudan. Instability in Sudan saw the establishment of peacekeeping missions in Darfur (2007), the disputed Abyei region and newly independent South Sudan (both 2011). Other peacekeeping missions established in recent years have included Liberia (2003), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (2004), Haiti (2004), Timor-Leste (2006), Democratic Republic of the Congo (2010), Libya (2011), Mali (2013), the Central African Republic (2014) and, again, Haiti (2017). In April 2012 the Security Council established a mission in Syria to monitor the cessation of armed violence and to oversee a UN\u2013League of Arab States six-point peace plan. However, with continuing violence obstructing implementation of the mandate, the mission was ended in Aug. 2012. While UN sanctions have been tightened against North Korea in response to weapons tests carried out by Pyongyang, those against Iran were lifted in Jan. 2016 following implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear development activities. In 2015 the UN launched the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, comprising 17 specific targets to be achieved over 15 years, designed as a successor programme to the Millennium Development Goals. In Jan. 2017 Ant\u00f3nio Guterres took office as the UN\u2019s Secretary-General. In Nov. that year the UN imposed its strongest sanctions to date on North Korea in response to Pyongyang\u2019s continued nuclear testing programme. A month later the UN General Assembly supported a non-binding resolution effectively rejecting the USA\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In Aug. 2018 the UN issued a report on military atrocities against Myanmar\u2019s Muslim Rohingya minority in 2017 that called for the investigation and prosecution of the country\u2019s senior generals for genocide.",

However, reform is in the hands of the permanent members and a unanimous agreement has proved elusive. In Sept. 2004 Brazil, Germany, India and Japan (the G4) launched a joint bid for permanent membership, along with a seat for an African state. In March 2005 then Secretary-General Annan proposed either six new permanent members and three new non-permanent members or the election of a new type of member, eight of which would be elected for a four-year period. The World Summit in Sept. 2005 failed to agree on Security Council reform but pledged to continue negotiations.",

Crucial to this status is the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the expulsion from or forcible return of refugees to a country where they may have reason to fear persecution. UNHCR pursues its objectives in the field of protection by encouraging the conclusion of intergovernmental legal instruments in favour of refugees, by supervising the implementation of their provisions and by encouraging governments to adopt legislation and administrative procedures for the benefit of refugees. UNHCR is often called upon to provide material assistance (e.g. the provision of food, shelter, medical care and essential supplies) while durable solutions are being sought.

Signatories agreed to take account of climate change in their domestic policy and to develop national programmes that would slow its progress. However, no mandatory targets were established for the reduction of emissions so the treaty remained legally non-binding. Instead it operates as a \u2018framework\u2019 document, with provisions for regular updates and amendments. By Jan. 2019, 196 states and territories plus the European Union had signed and ratified the Convention.",

These targets were scheduled to be met in the period 2008\u201312. By 2012 results were mixed. The EU had reduced emissions by 21\u22190% and Russia by 50\u22193%, while the USA\u2019s had risen by 2\u22197%, Canada\u2019s by 42\u22192%, New Zealand\u2019s by 111\u22194% and Turkey\u2019s by 163\u22193%. In Dec. 2011 Canada announced it would be the first signatory to formally withdraw from the agreement. A second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol began on 1 Jan. 2013. The USA has not ratified the protocol. China and India, also amongst the world\u2019s top five producers of emissions, are exempt from the protocol\u2019s constraints by virtue of their status as developing countries.",

The conference in Indonesia in 2007 led to the creation of the \u2018Bali Roadmap\u2019, which timetables negotiations for a protocol to succeed Kyoto, a process continued at the 2008 conference in Poland. The subsequent Copenhagen Accord of 2009 was not legally binding and failed to set out concrete measures for tackling climate change. The 2011 conference, held in Durban, South Africa, advanced negotiations on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Action Plan and the Canc\u00fan Agreements. At the 18th conference in Doha, Qatar in 2012 plans were laid for the development of a successor protocol by 2015 to be implemented by 2020. The 2014 conference, in Lima, Peru, saw a framework agreement approved by 194 nations for setting national pledges for submission at the conference in Paris, France in 2015. The Paris conference duly concluded a global agreement on countering climate change, although no country-specific goals were set. Follow-up conferences were hosted in Marrakesh, Morocco, in Nov. 2016, Bonn, Germany, in Nov. 2017 and Katowice, Poland, in Dec. 2018. A further conference was scheduled to take place in Chile in Nov. 2019. However, in June 2017 President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the USA from the agreement.Headquarters: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Campus, Platz der Vereinten Nationen 1, 53113 Bonn, Germany.Website:\nhttp://unfccc.intExecutive Secretary: Patricia Espinosa (Mexico).",
