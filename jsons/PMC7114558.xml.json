            "text": "Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is a highly contagious neurotropic alpha herpes virus that causes varicella (chickenpox) during acute infection. VZV is spread through the inhalation of virus particles or through direct contact with infectious fluid from skin lesions (Arvin, 2001, Grose, 1981). VZV establishes latency in sensory ganglia, from which it can reactivate causing herpes zoster (shingles), a painful disease most commonly affecting the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Previous studies have shown that T cells are highly susceptible to VZV infection and may play a critical role in its dissemination to the skin and ganglia. Specifically, direct inoculation of fetal thymus/liver implanted under the kidney capsule of SCID-hu mice with VZV-infected fibroblasts results in the infection of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes (Moffat et al., 1995). In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that VZV has a high propensity to infect tonsillar T cells (Ku et al., 2002). Moreover, co-culture experiments showed that activated tonsillar CD4 T cells with skin homing markers were more likely to be infected with VZV (Ku et al., 2002). Importantly, human tonsillar CD4 T cells infected in vitro with VZV, but not fibroblasts, intravenously injected into SCID-hu mice were able to transport VZV to fetal human skin explant resulting in development of varicella rash (Ku et al., 2004) and fetal dorsal root ganglia xenografts (Zerboni et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Although these in vitro studies suggest that T cells play a critical role in VZV pathogenesis, none of these findings have been confirmed using T cells isolated from varicella patients. Moreover, the strict host tropism of VZV has precluded the development of animal models. An alternative is to use rhesus macaques intra-bronchially infected with the homologous simian varicella virus (SVV). This model mimics the key characteristics of VZV infection including the development of varicella, cellular and humoral immune responses, the establishment of latency in sensory ganglia, and reactivation (Messaoudi et al., 2009, Mahalingam et al., 2010, Mahalingam et al., 2007, Kolappaswamy et al., 2007). As described for VZV, we and others have demonstrated that SVV primarily infects T cells that traffic to the ganglia as early as 3 days post-infection (Ouwendijk et al., 2013, Arnold et al., 2016a). Moreover, we showed that T cells isolated from the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) during acute infection supported SVV replication (Arnold et al., 2016a). These data firmly establish the importance of T cells in SVV pathogenesis making this model ideal for investigating how VZV infection alters T cell behavior and function. In this study, we used this animal model to investigate the transcriptional changes that SVV infection induces within CD4 and CD8 T cells isolated from the BAL during acute infection. Our results show that SVV induces robust transcriptional changes involved with chromatin assembly, translation, cell cycle and cellular metabolism. In addition, several gene expression changes reveal possible mechanisms by which SVV may evade the host response.",

Briefly, BAL cells were first incubated with CD4 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego) for 20 mins at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then washed and applied to the magnetic column to capture CD4 T cells. The negative fraction was then stained with anti-CD8 PE (Beckman Coulter) for 20 mins in the dark at 4 \u00b0C followed by a wash and incubation with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 mins in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then washed and the cell suspension was applied to a second magnetic column to isolate CD8 T cells. To determine purity, cells were stained with antibodies directed against surface markers CD4 (Tonbo Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and CD8\u03b2 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Samples were acquired using an LSRII instrument (Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using Flowjo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). All samples used had a purity of >90%.",

RNA library preparation was done using the New England Biolab (NEB) Next Ultra Direction RNA Prep kit for Illumina (Ipswich, MA). We were unable to generate a library of the CD4 T cells isolated from the 7 DPI and 10 DPI animals. Therefore, we only have paired CD4/CD8 libraries from the animal euthanized 3 DPI and our control animals; and only a CD8 T cell library from the animals euthanized 7 DPI and 10 DPI (Table 1). Libraries were next multiplexed and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) platform at single-ends 75bps. All data analysis steps were performed with the RNA-Seq workflow module of the systemPiperR package available on Bioconductor (Huber et al., 2015, Girke, 2015). Next generation sequencing quality reports were generated with the seeFastq function defined by the same package. Reads were mapped with the splice junction aware short read alignment suite Bowtie2/Tophat2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012, Kim et al., 2013) against the Macaca mulatta genome sequence downloaded from Ensembl (Cunningham et al., 2015). The default parameters of Tophat2 optimized for mammalian genomes were used for the alignments. Raw expression values in the form of gene-level read counts were generated with the summarizeOverlaps function(Lawrence et al., 2013). Only reads that overlapped with exonic regions of genes were counted, while reads that mapped to ambiguous regions of exons from overlapping genes were discarded.",

Overall, the smallest number of DEGs was detected at 3 DPI (887) while the largest number of DEGs was detected 10 DPI (1674) (Fig. 4\nA). Enrichment analysis of the 417 upregulated DEGs detected 3 DPI revealed that these DEGs play a role in gene expression and immunity (Table 2\n). Specifically, DEGs enriched to process networks: \u201ctranslation initiation\u201d which included several ribosomal protein L (RPL) and S (RPS) genes; \u201ccell cycle\u201d (e.g CDK4 (FC 7) AKT1(FC 3) and MAP2K2 (FC 4)); \u201cchromatin modification\u201d (e.g. HDAC5 (FC 2), MBD3 (FC 3) and HIST1H1C (FC4)); TCR signaling (e.g. CD3 (FC 4), CD8 (FC 9), NF-AT (FC 4), and ZAP70 (FC 11)); and lymphocyte proliferation (e.g. CCL5 (FC 6), IL-2R (FC 9) and IL-4R (FC 2) (Table 2). Additional functional enrichment analysis revealed that several upregulated DEGS at 3 DPI mapped to GO processes related to the regulation of gene expression (e.g. SBNO2 (FC4), MAF1(FC 2), SMARCC2 (FC 2) and ERN1 (FC 4)) and antiviral immunity (such as IFITM1 (FC 4), IRF1 (FC4), GRMB (FC 17), and TNF\u03b1 (FC3)). The 470 downregulated DEGs detected 3 DPI played a role in phagocytosis (e.g. CLEC7A (FC6), MSR1 (FC 6) and SYK (FC2)); antigen presentation (e.g. SIRPA (FC 3) ACTN1 (FC4) and FGR (FC3)); cell adhesion (e.g. CDH6 (FC 9), DAB2 (FC5) and PVR (FC 5); and cell localization (such as CD163 (FC 9), CD9 (FC 3), and IL-8 (FC 12)). A large number of downregulated DEGs mapped to the GO process \u201cresponse to stress\u201d and include genes that play a role in immunity as well as apoptosis (e.g. CARD8 (FC 4), CARD9 (FC 4) and HIPK2 (FC 6)) and cellular metabolism (e.g. HK3 (FC 5), GPAM (FC 11) and GK (FC 4)). The 86 DEGs detected only 3 DPI (Fig. 4A) include several that play a role in: 1) the immune response such as the chemokine CCL5 (FC6, upregulated); 2) chromatin modification such as HIST1H1AH (FC 6, upregulated); and the regulation of the cell cycle such as E4F1 (FC5, upregulated) (Supplemental Table 1).",

In this study, we leveraged a robust animal model where rhesus macaques are intrabronchially infected with the closely related SVV to address this question. We characterized SVV-induced changes in the trancriptome of T cells isolated from the BAL that were previously shown to harbor SVV transcripts (Arnold et al., 2016a).

Ribosomes play a critical role in protein synthesis and have indeed been found to support viral protein synthesis (Walsh et al., 2013). Specifically, RPL40 supports vesicular stomatitis virus translation (Lee et al., 2013) and EIF4 supports translation of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) (Walsh and Mohr, 2004) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Walsh et al., 2005). Many histone genes, which regulate chromatin assembly, were also upregulated after SVV infection. HIST1H3 and HIST1H1 in our dataset were also shown to support replication of other DNA viruses such as adenoviruses and HSV-1 (Komatsu and Nagata, 2012, Conn et al., 2008, Lieberman, 2008). Moreover, the inhibition of histone demethylase has been shown to block HSV and VZV replication (Liang et al., 2009) and VZV ORF 63 has been shown to regulate histone levels in infected cells (Ambagala et al., 2009). Several of the other upregulated transcription factors that were involved with chromatin assembly such as CFOS, JUNB and JUND were reported to be upregulated with other viral infections such as kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Xie et al., 2008), Epstein-barr virus (Song et al., 2004) measles (Helin et al., 2002), JC virus (Sadowska et al., 2003) and echoviruses (Huttunen et al., 1997).",

For instance, genes important for calcium signaling such as CAMK4 and CACNP were upregulated in our dataset and were previously reported to enhance HSV1/2 and HIV infection by activating the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate pathway (Cheshenko et al., 2003, Chami et al., 2006). More importantly, calcium treatment of keratinocytes has also been shown to increase VZV gene expression (Jones et al., 2014). In addition, we saw a downregulation of insulin signaling (e.g. ENPP1 FC14), IRS2 (FC3) and IGFR2 (FC2)). Similarly, Hepatitis C virus has been shown to reduce insulin signaling in infected cells (Gao et al., 2015). Moreover, as previously described for HIV-infected T cells (Rasheed et al., 2008), we observed a down-regulation of genes that regulate lipid metabolism (e.g. APOC2 (FC 12), PPAR\u03b3 (FC 8)). These observations suggest that SVV, like other viruses, may dysregulate T cell metabolism in order to support successful viral replication. However, reduced expression of genes important for metabolic processes could be part of the host defense response to SVV. For instance, genes involved with nitric oxide regulation (e.g, EDF1, FC 3) known to inhibit viral replication, were upregulated in our data set (Reiss and Komatsu, 1998). In addition, fatty acid synthesis genes (e.g. ACP5 (FC3), FABP5 (FC2) and FAR1 (FC2)) were found to be downregulated in our dataset. Since fatty acid acylation has been shown to support the formation of VZV virions by facilitating production of VZV glycoproteins (Namazue et al., 1989), downregulation of these genes could be a host defense mechanism aimed at limiting viral egress.",

Up-regulation of ISGs could be in response to the robust up-regulation of IFN\u03b1 in BAL of SVV infected macaques, which we previously reported (Meyer et al., 2013). Other immune genes that were upregulated include cytolytic molecules and components of the TCR signaling complex. Our results are in line with those from previous in vitro studies that investigated how VZV infection affects the phenotype of human tonsil T cells using mass cytometry (CyTOF). Those studies reported increased expression of ZAP70, AKT, and CD3 (Sen et al., 2015). SVV-induced T cell activation may increase viral gene expression and enhance T cell trafficking to the ganglia/skin as previously reported for VZV (Ku et al., 2002, Ku et al., 2004, Zerboni et al., 2005).",

These included pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) such as CLEC7a and MSR1 which were also downregulated following influenza infection (Yu et al., 2011). The down-regulation of these genes may be indicative of viral immune evasion strategies employed by SVV. Indeed, down-regulation of antigen presentation has been reported in VZV infected T cells (Abendroth et al., 2000, Abendroth et al., 2001). Other downregulated genes in our dataset were reported to act as entry receptors for other viruses; specifically, SCARB1, MRC1L1 and ITGAV have been reported to facilitate entry of hepatitis C, dengue virus and HSV1 respectively. Their reduced expression could be a strategy employed by the host to block viral entry. Expression of several chemokines such as CCL5, IL-8, CCL23, and CXCL16 was also reduced in our infected T cell population, which could also indicate a strategy for SVV to inhibit the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of infection. Similarly, human herpesvirus-6A (HHV6A) has been shown to downregulate expression of CCL5 (Catusse et al., 2008).",

Comparison of that dataset to the one included in this manuscript revealed very few common genes (1.9\u20135.5%) (Supplemental Fig. 3). This is most likely due to the fact that lung biopsies are primarily composed of type I and II pneumocytes (epithelial cells) in addition to infiltrating immune cells whereas the current study focused exclusively on purified BAL-resident T cells which represent a small fraction of the cells within a lung biopsy. In contrast, the current gene expression data set shares similarity with a previous gene expression study that investigated the impact of in vitro VZV infection on human T cells using microarray analysis and reported increased expression of genes involved with antiviral immunity, cell cycle, transcription and translation .e.g. MXA, JUNB and NRP2 (Jones and Arvin, 2003). The limited similarities of our study with this earlier study could be due to the use of the attenuated Oka vaccine strain and the in vitro infection of the earlier study, which excludes other environmental factors that our T cells were exposed to in vivo.\n",

At each timepoint, several upregulated genes enriched to immune response and play a critical role in anti-viral immunity. The presence of these DEGs is most likely due to the fact that we analyzed a heterogeneous T cell population that included both infected and antigen-specific responding T cells. Changes in expression of these genes are consistent with the development of an immune response against SVV beginning 3 DPI as we previously reported (Arnold et al., 2016b, Haberthur et al., 2014).",

This may be a viral evasion strategy as both SVV (via ORF63 (Hood et al., 2006)) and VZV (via ORF12 (Liu et al., 2012)) have been shown to inhibit apoptosis in infected cells. In addition, genes encoding cell adhesion molecules were downregulated at each timepoint, which may lead to increased T cell motility normally associated with their activation (Andersson et al., 1994). In support of this possibility, decreased expression of cell adhesion molecules correlates with upregulated T cell activation genes in our data set. A down-regulation of cell adhesion molecules has been described for Epstein-Barr virus (Krishna et al., 2005) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Leis et al., 2004) infection. Interestingly, immune genes that mapped to antigen presentation were downregulated 3 and 10 DPI, but upregulated 7 DPI. This change in FC direction could be due to initial immune evasion strategies employed by SVV (Whitmer et al., 2015, Meysman et al., 2013) 3 DPI, followed by development of host defense 7 DPI, and again downregulation of these pathways as the immune response begins to resolve 10 DPI.",

Our data provides novel insight into how SVV may use the host cell machinery to support its replication while evading host defense responses. Overall, we found that SVV infection of T cells leads to increased expression of genes important for chromatin modification, TCR signaling, and decreases expression of genes that play a role in antigen presentation and cellular metabolism. Changes in expression of genes important for regulation of gene expression may be critical for supporting viral replication. Increased expression of T cell activation genes may enhance the ability of SVV infected T cells to traffic to the skin and ganglia. Since T cells play a critical role in VZV dissemination, our RNA-Seq analysis may guide future studies in the development of more efficacious antivirals. The major limitation of our study is that we were not able to isolate SVV-infected T cells from bystander (and potentially antigen-specific) T cells that precluded us from determining whether gene expression changes originated from the infected T cells or from T cells responding to SVV infection. This limitation will be addressed in future studies by utilizing single cell RNASeq analysis.",
