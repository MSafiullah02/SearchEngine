In particular, respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous different viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens that are indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. Respiratory tract infections are also among the most common infections in humans, with approximately 6\u22129 episodes per year in children and 2\u22124 episodes per year in adults [1]. These infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality as well as high healthcare costs associated with doctor visits, hospitalizations, treatment, and absences from work and school. Early diagnosis of the etiological agent in a respiratory infection permits effective antimicrobial therapy and appropriate management of the disease.",

Further, molecular testing methodologies that permit multiplexing have the advantage that they allow for simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acid sequences from the same sample in a single reaction vessel. Multiplexed tests reduce the time, labor, and cost of laboratory testing as compared to single reaction detection methods, and in addition to improved efficiency, also have a higher diagnostic yield by the ability to detect multiple infections. Thus, multiplexed molecular assays are an efficient method for the definitive diagnosis of respiratory infections and can also provide information on coinfections and secondary infections. Among the various multiplexing technologies available, microsphere- or bead-based suspension arrays have emerged as a standard molecular multiplexing technology in the clinical microbiology laboratory. As compared to planar arrays, some of the benefits of bead-based arrays include ease of use, low cost, statistical superiority, excellent sensitivity and specificity, faster hybridization kinetics, flexibility in array preparation, and rapid data acquisition [2, 3].",

Key drivers for adoption of the xMAP platform include cost savings, labor and workflow efficiencies, sample conservation, high sensitivity, and broad dynamic range. The system has the added benefit of being an open platform in that assays can be rapidly developed, optimized, and implemented by the end user. The versatility of this open architecture is evidenced by approximately 10,000 peer-reviewed publications describing a variety of applications. As a result, the platform was rapidly adopted for nucleic acid and protein analysis in various laboratory settings, and further, the Luminex\u00ae 200\u2122 system has achieved a 510(k) clearance status for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) applications. The breadth of bioanalytical applications on the platform includes hundreds of commercially available analytes and a vast number of custom assays developed for a global install base of more than 7,000 instruments.

Using precise amounts of each of these fluorochromes, an array is created consisting of different bead sets with specific spectral addresses. The unique spectral characteristics within individual bead sets allow each bead region to be specifically differentiated from all others in a multiplex. Each bead set can possess a different reactant on its surface and because bead sets can be distinguished by their spectral addresses and each address is associated with a specific analyte or target, they can be combined in a single reaction to measure up to 500 different analytes simultaneously. An additional fluorochrome coupled to a reporter molecule quantifies the biomolecular interaction that has occurred at the bead surface. The configuration of an xMAP nucleic assay consists of a suspension array where specific capture oligonucleotides are covalently coupled to the surfaces of the internally dyed bead sets. After completion of assay incubations with a nucleic acid sample and a detectable reporter reagent, the reactions are analyzed within a Luminex reader, classifying the beads based on the spectral address or bead identity (region) and quantifying the bound fluorophore in the reporter detection channel. The potential for simultaneous detection of 1\u2212500 protein or nucleic acid targets provides for rapid, sensitive, and specific multiplexed molecular analyses.",

Inclusion of a third internal dye has allowed the expansion from the original 100\u2013500 bead regions (Fig. 42.1). Several varieties of fluorescent bead reagents are available from Luminex. The fundamental MicroPlex\u00ae Microspheres are 5.6 \u03bcm polystyrene beads functionalized with surface carboxyl groups for covalent attachment of capture ligands. Most of the currently available xMAP assays were developed on MicroPlex Microspheres. MagPlex\u00ae Microspheres are 6.5 \u03bcm superparamagnetic beads functionalized with surface carboxyl groups for covalent attachment of ligands. MagPlex Microspheres exhibit both high performance and low nonspecific binding, and they can be magnetically separated from solution, allowing easy automation of assay processes and simplifying assay wash steps. Microsphere reagents precoupled with unique capture oligonucleotides (oligos) are also available for nucleic acid assay development. These reagents incorporate the use of xTAG\u00ae Technology, a proprietary universal tag sorting system that allows easy optimization, development, and expansion of molecular diagnostic assays and eliminates the need to couple content-specific capture probes to the beads. xTAG oligos are optimized to be an isothermal set and have minimum cross-reactivity. Earlier assays used MicroPlex-TAG\u2122 Microspheres which are nonmagnetic MicroPlex beads, containing two internal fluorescent dyes and precoupled with xTAG oligo capture sequences (anti-TAGs). These beads have been replaced with MagPlex-TAG\u2122 Microspheres which are superparamagnetic MagPlex beads, containing two or three internal fluorescent dyes and precoupled with anti-TAG capture oligos.\n",

The Luminex 200 and the FLEXMAP 3D are flow analyzers capable of multiplexing up to 100- or 500-plex, respectively, with fluidics and laser-based optics similar to traditional flow cytometry instruments. The MAGPIX utilizes a flow cell and CCD-based optics with magnetic beads for multiplexing up to 50-plex. In the flow analyzers, the beads are introduced into a rapidly flowing fluid stream and through hydrodynamic focusing, are interrogated individually as they pass by two separate lasers. A 635-nm, 10-mW red diode laser excites the fluorochromes contained within the microspheres and a 532-nm, 13-mW yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser excites the reporter fluorochrome (R-phycoerythrin, Alexa 532, or Cy-3) bound to the bead surface. High-speed digital signal processing classifies the microsphere based on its spectral address and quantifies the reaction on the microsphere surface. Multiple readings are made per microsphere set, providing valid and robust statistics. Thousands of microspheres are interrogated per second resulting in a system capable of analyzing and reporting up to 500 different reactions in a single reaction vessel in just a few seconds per sample.\n",

Capture oligos should be resuspended and diluted in dH2O as Tris, azide, or other amine-containing buffers can interfere in the coupling process. If oligos were previously solubilized in an amine-containing buffer, they should be desalted by column or precipitation and resuspended into dH2O. Stock uncoupled carboxylated beads are washed and resuspended in 100 mM 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 4.5. The capture oligo is added, followed by addition of N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and incubation in the dark for 30 min. The EDC addition and incubation are repeated and then the coupled beads are washed once with 0.02 % Tween-20 and once with 0.1 % SDS. Coupled microspheres are stored in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE) at 2\u20138 \u00b0C in the dark. When properly stored, coupled microspheres are usually stable for more than 1 year [7]. Coupling reactions can be easily scaled up or down according to user needs. Initial coupling and optimization of coupling amount (i.e., nmol oligo per million microspheres) is usually done in small coupling reactions of 2.5\u22125 million microspheres. Coupling reactions can then be scaled up for manufacturing and preparation of bulk reagents. For optimal coupling efficiency, it is important to perform oligo coupling reactions in as small a reaction volume as possible, typically 25\u2212100 \u03bcL for 2.5\u2212100 million beads [8].",

            "text": "Several assay chemistries have been used for nucleic acid detection on the xMAP system. One approach is to use direct hybridization of a labeled PCR-amplified target DNA to bead sets bearing oligonucleotide capture probes specific for each sequence (Fig. 42.3). Direct hybridization is the simplest assay chemistry that can provide single nucleotide discrimination and takes advantage of the fact that the melting temperature for hybridization of a perfectly matched template compared to one with a single base mismatch can differ by several degrees for capture oligos approximately 15\u221220 nucleotides in length [11, 12]. The reaction kinetics can be adversely affected by immobilization of the reactant on a solid surface but these effects are less severe for bead-based suspension arrays; however, the diffusion rate of the immobilized capture probe can be slower and the effective concentration is reduced as compared to free DNA in solution [13]. Design of sequence-specific capture probes and PCR primers for a direct hybridization assay on the xMAP suspension array can be facilitated through the use of a tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC)-containing hybridization buffer. TMAC stabilizes AT base pairs, minimizing the effect of base composition on hybridization [14, 15]. For oligos less than 200 base pairs in length, hybridization efficiency in TMAC is a function of the length of the perfect match and less dependent on base composition. Thus, hybridization buffers incorporating 3 or 4 M TMAC equalize the melting points of different probes, allowing probes with different characteristics to be used under identical conditions with high duplex yields [16, 17]. Typically for single nucleotide discrimination, capture probes are designed to be matched in length at approximately 20 nucleotides. The probes are complementary in sequence to the labeled strand of the PCR product and the polymorphic nucleotide is located at the center of the probe, as mismatches in the center have a more profound effect on the equilibrium state than mismatches near the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032end [18, 19].\n",

The probe melting temperature is influenced by length, sequence, and type and position of the mismatched base. The effect of a mismatch on hybridization is greater with increasing temperature and decreasing probe length [12, 20]. Thus, discrimination can be improved by increasing the hybridization temperature and/or decreasing the probe length. After testing known DNA samples under a set of standard hybridization conditions, nucleotides are added to the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of the probe to improve sensitivity or removed from the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of the probe to increase specificity. The position of the polymorphism within the probe sequence can be adjusted when necessary to avoid formation of secondary structures and adequate specificity can usually be achieved when the polymorphic nucleotide is between positions 8 and 14 of a 20-nucleotide probe [19].",

Using a small target DNA minimizes the potential for steric hindrance to affect hybridization efficiency. In some cases, larger targets (400\u22121,200 base pairs) have been used successfully, suggesting that hybridization efficiency is also dependent on the sequence and overall secondary structure of target [21]. Hybridization kinetics and thermodynamic affinities of matched and mismatched sequences can be driven in a concentration-dependent manner [22]. At concentrations beyond the saturation level, the hybridization efficiency can decrease presumably due to competition of the complementary strand and renaturation of the PCR product [20, 23]. Therefore, it is also important to determine the range of target concentrations that yield efficient hybridization without sacrificing discrimination.",

This format involves the incorporation of a specific capture sequence during the enzymatic step that allows hybridization to a complementary \u201caddress\u201d sequence on the bead surface. Commonly used enzymatic methods for sequence determination rely on the discriminating ability of DNA polymerases and DNA ligases, and include allele-specific or target-specific primer extension (ASPE or TSPE), oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), single base chain extension (SBCE), and target-specific PCR (TS-PCR) [24\u201326]. This approach takes advantage of solution-phase kinetics and permits the addressed bead sets to be used in many different assays where new sequences can be targeted by adding the appropriate capture sequence to the target-specific oligo used in the enzymatic step. Hybridization buffer and reaction conditions for detection are dependent upon the capture sequences attached to the microspheres. Commercially available Luminex MagPlex-TAG Microspheres, precoupled with xTAG capture oligos (anti-TAGs) are compatible with solution-based enzymatic chemistries.

In TSPE, a thermostable polymerase is used to extend the primer by incorporation of dNTPs, including one which is biotin-labeled. Extension only occurs if the 3\u2032 nucleotide of the primer is complementary and can anneal to the template DNA. OLA employs the same oligo design but a thermostable ligase is used to ligate a biotin-labeled oligo (reporter probe) that is complementary to the sequence downstream from the target nucleotide. The reporter probe is designed to be matched in melting temperature at 51\u221256 \u00b0C, is phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end to provide a substrate for ligase, and is biotin-labeled at the 3\u2032 end for fluorescent detection with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. For SBCE, individual reactions must be set up for each of the four possible nucleotides and a thermostable polymerase is used to incorporate a single biotin-labeled ddNTP. Extension occurs only if the nucleotide complementary to the sequence immediately downstream of the primer is present in the reaction. Targets for SBCE can be combined for each of the nucleotide reactions and if different capture sequences are used for each, the products can be multiplexed for capture onto the addressed microsphere sets. For TS-PCR, target sequences are directly amplified and labeled by PCR using one primer containing both capture and target-specific sequences paired with a biotinylated target-specific primer. This method requires a strategy which minimizes or eliminates production of the capture sequence in the nontarget strand, which would compete for hybridization of the target to the addressed bead. Some methods include asymmetric PCR, post-PCR treatment with phosphatase and exonuclease, or incorporating a spacer between the capture-specific and target-specific sequences of the primer [29]. TS-PCR chemistry eliminates the need for separate amplification and target-specific enzymatic steps, thus simplifying the assay procedure and reducing reagent costs and turnaround time.",

Coinfections were found in 27 % of the specimens tested. Using multiple statistical methods, they determined patterns of association between pathogens found in individual specimens. Potential positive correlations were found for specimens coinfected with the following: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Flu-B, and CVEV and RhV. In addition, while overall prevalence for S. pneumoniae was 20 %, prevalence was 26 % in RSV B positive specimens.

Specificity was greater than 91 % (91.3\u2212100 %) for all analytes, the limit of detection (LoD) was from 6  \u00d7  10\u22122 to 5  \u00d7  10  4 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL, and overall site-to-site reproducibility was 98.2 %. No interference was detected in 16 combinations of analyte plus potential bacterial or viral interferent, and no cross-reactivity was observed for 26 other bacterial and viral pathogens tested. One BocV sample yielded a false positive call for RhV but was subsequently determined to be contaminated with RhV. In addition, there were no significant differences in the sensitivity of the target analytes in medicated versus unmedicated patients.",

RVP showed 100 % sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV), 93 % specificity, and near perfect agreement with culture. ResPlex II had slightly higher specificity (94 %), 80 % positive predictive value (PPV), and 89 % sensitivity. Coinfections were detected in 1\u22124.5 % of samples, most of which included a PIV, furthermore PIV-1 and PIV-2 were only detected in multiple infections. The ResPlex II was easiest to use with one reagent preparation/amplification step and one hybridization/detection step, generating results in 5.5 h, whereas RVP was more labor intensive with five reagent preparation steps and two thermal cycler programs, resulting in a 7\u22128 h turnaround time. The ResPlex II (RUO) offered a broader coverage of virus types than the RVP (IVD) assay, but RVP had the ability to differentiate human from nonhuman Flu-A subtypes. The authors concluded that as compared to culture, multiplexed molecular assays could provide enhanced sensitivity, faster turnaround time, and broader coverage, and should prove to be a useful tool for respiratory virus identification as an aid in patient management and outbreak investigations.",

Wong et al. used the RVP assay in a retrospective study of 1,108 specimens from 244 suspected respiratory virus outbreaks to assess utility for enhanced respiratory outbreak investigation [41]. When used in combination with DFA and various in-house nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs), RVP testing improved detection of a viral etiological agent from 72.5 to 90.8 % of outbreaks. The RVP assay also proved to be an effective aid for the detection of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 strains [42\u201344]. While the assay can detect the matrix gene of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1, it cannot identify the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 in clinical specimens. In New York during the 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 outbreak, the RVP assay was used to test 375 samples that initially tested positive for Flu-A by rapid antigen tests, DFA, and culture, or were from patients with suspected infection. RVP identified 201 samples as Flu-A, with 60 identified as seasonal (H1 and H3) strains but the remaining 141 were unsubtypeable (negative for both H1 and H3). The CDC real-time RT-PCR assay specific for 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 was used to further test 101 of these specimens and 99 were identified as positive for 2009 Flu-A/H1N1. These data indicated that the predictability of unsubtypeable Flu-A identified by the RVP assay to be pandemic Flu-A/H1N1 was high. Implementation of RVP screening in the testing algorithm enabled the laboratory to rapidly subtype Flu-A, rule out seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes, detect additional respiratory viruses, and identify probable pandemic Flu-A/H1N1 cases.",

The assay has been approved for IVD use in the United States, Canada, and Europe for 8\u221217 virus types and subtypes (Table 42.2). The targets detected have been modified slightly from the RVP assay and, depending on geographical location, can additionally detect BocV. RVP FAST uses TS-PCR chemistry where a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction is performed using target-specific upstream primers containing a TAG capture sequence paired with biotinylated downstream primers to amplify the target sequences in a single reaction. The amplified product is added to a combined hybridization/detection reaction containing the corresponding anti-TAG bead sets and streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin reporter, and then the completed reactions are read on the Luminex analyzer to determine the MFI signal. The raw fluorescence values are then analyzed using TDAS for RVP FAST software and each target interpreted as present or absent. The RVP FAST assay combines amplification with target-specific extension, and uses a combined hybridization and detection step, resulting in a turnaround time of less than 5 h (including nucleic acid extraction). Further, the risk of contamination from post-PCR manipulation is minimized by the reduction of operator handling steps to a single post-PCR transfer.\n",

At least one respiratory virus was detected in 13.6 % of specimens by culture and DFA combined, in 49.7 % by real-time RT-PCR, and in 46.2 % by RVP FAST. Using real-time RT-PCR results as the gold standard, RVP FAST had 78.8 % sensitivity and 99.6 % specificity. Specimens not detected by RVP FAST generally had low viral loads or contained AdV. For some viral targets, few positive samples were available in the set tested, which suggests that further study using larger numbers of positive samples is needed to fully assess sensitivity of RVP FAST for all targets. Overall, the investigators found RVP FAST to be rapid and easy to perform in comparison to the multiple real-time RT-PCR assays that would be required for equal target coverage. Pabbaraju et al. compared RVP FAST with the original RVP assay on 334 respiratory specimens that had been previously characterized for a variety of respiratory virus targets [48]. Samples were tested in parallel by both assays and the RVP assay was found to be more sensitive than RVP FAST for the combined targets, with sensitivities of 88.6 and 77.5 %, respectively. However, RVP FAST was tenfold more sensitive for the detection of RSV A. Targets not detected by RVP FAST were primarily Flu-B, PIV-2, and CoV 229E. In addition, a small number of samples positive for Flu-A, RSV B, hMNV, and PIV-1 were not detected by the RVP assay and generally had low viral loads. Reproducibility was similar between the two assays but RVP FAST exhibited better reproducibility for detection of AdV at the LoD. The authors concluded that RVP FAST met the diagnostic needs for sensitivity and specificity in their laboratory with the exception of Flu-B, which had decreased sensitivity for Flu-B in specimens collected in 2010. Reduced sensitivity for PIV-2 and CoV 229E was of lesser concern because PIV-2 has low prevalence and detection of CoV 229E does not affect established patient management protocols. Their preliminary studies also indicated that use of RVP FAST will lead to cost savings and improved turnaround time as a result of the shorter protocol and a reduction in hands-on time to 1.5 h.",

As an example, the emergence of antiviral resistance in influenza has raised concerns about use of antiviral drugs and treatment in response to future pandemic outbreaks. Amantadine resistance has increased dramatically for Flu-A/H3N2 and Flu-A/H1N1, and increasing oseltamivir resistance for seasonal Flu-A/H1N1 has been reported worldwide since 2007 [49\u201351]. Currently, resistance testing is done by sequencing or phenotypic assays which can be costly and time consuming; however, a multiplexed bead-based array could be applied for this purpose in combination with or in addition to a comprehensive respiratory viral panel. This is illustrated in a report of a multiplexed bead-based LDT that was developed for simultaneous identification of Flu-A subtypes and the oseltamivir resistance genotype [52]. The assay employed the use of degenerate primers for amplification of the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes and eight target-specific primers with TAG modifications for TSPE and subsequent detection on MicroPlex-xTAG beads. The assay was evaluated using 54 NP specimens that were Flu-A positive by DFA or real-time RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and was capable of correctly identifying the Flu-A subtype and the oseltamivir sensitive (H275) and resistance (H275Y) alleles in all samples. Of the 17 seasonal Flu-A/H1N1 isolates, H275Y was identified in 15, and of the 24 pandemic 2009 Flu-A/H1N1 isolates, 12 were H275 (sensitive), 3 were H275Y (resistant), and 9 revealed a combination of both alleles. The assay was also inexpensive to run with a combined reagent cost of $6.95 Canadian dollars (CAD) per test.",

            "text": "Cost analysis studies indicate that use of a multiplexed bead-based array for diagnosis of respiratory viral infections can be less expensive than routine strategies using DFA and/or culture. A 2009 cost analysis revealed that the average diagnostic cost per pediatric inpatient was lowest for a strategy using xTAG RVP testing alone as compared to DFA alone, DFA plus culture, and DFA plus RVP assay [53]. When all four diagnostic strategies were compared, RVP alone was the least costly strategy when the prevalence of infection was 11 % or higher but DFA alone was less costly when the prevalence was less than 11 %. They estimated a savings of $291 CAD per case if the xTAG RVP test alone was used to replace DFA plus culture, and a savings of $529,620 CAD per year in direct costs for the four hospitals included in the study. An operational workflow analysis using lean methodology principles was employed in another study to evaluate potential advantages of a multiplexed bead-based array for laboratory workflow and associated cost [54]. Implementation of the RVP assay resulted in a standardized workflow that decreased laboratory costs and improved efficiency as compared to DFA and culture for diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Workflow was evaluated in terms of total hands-on time and number of operator steps, and all hospital and laboratory costs associated with testing were calculated for each test for both positive and negative result scenarios. Combining the scores for all samples included in the analysis revealed that the hands-on time to completion for 1,015 samples was 80 h for RVP as compared to 503 h for DFA and culture. Total cost per sample was $99.75 United States dollar (USD) for DFA-positive samples (no culture or additional testing performed) and ranged from $329.68 to $429.07 USD for DFA-negative samples which are reflexed to culture with variable time to completion. The total cost for RVP was $135.03 USD, regardless of result. Further, although RVP required more time, steps, and was slightly more expensive per test than DFA screening alone, only 23 % of the sample population studied were DFA-positive. The additional time and costs associated with follow-up culture for the large percentage of DFA-negative specimens were far greater. Thus, the bead-based array assays not only provide increased diagnostic capability for respiratory viral infections but can also maximize efficiency and reduce the costs associated with diagnosis.",
