The aetiological agent was a previously unknown coronavirus, now named SARS associated coronavirus or SARS\u2013CoV, which seems to be evolutionally distant to any of the existing coronaviruses known at the time (Rota et al., 2003, Marra et al.). Initial epidemiology studies indicated an animal origin (Xu et al., 2004), which was further confirmed by the detection and isolation of almost identical viruses from wild life animals in live animal markets (Guan et al., 2003). More recently, SARS\u2013like-CoVs were identified among different species of horseshoe bats (Li et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2005), implicating bats as the potential reservoir of these novel coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2006).",

Receptor-binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell is mediated by the S protein, which is also the main target for neutralizing antibodies (Lai et al., 2007). The S protein is a large class I transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two domains: the S1 domain at the N terminus responsible for receptor-binding and the C-terminal S2 domain functioning in fusion. For SARS\u2013CoV, the minimal receptor-binding domain has been defined as a 193-aa fragment (aa 318\u2013510) which binds to the receptor molecule, ACE2, in vitro (Li et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004). The N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and interfere with cell cycle processes of host cells. In addition, the N protein of many coronaviruses is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection, making it an attractive target for detection of virus-specific antibodies (Lai et al., 2007).",

Most, if not all, of these detection methods were developed for human applications. There is a lack of attention to the study of immune responses in different animal species and a lack of proper diagnostic tools for wide range surveillance of animal populations. Yet, it is well documented that SARS\u2013CoVs and SARS-like-CoVs can infect a wide range of animal species (Wang et al., 2006). In most cases, there is no obvious clinical sign associated with the infection, making early detection and diagnosis even more difficult. Knowing that SARS\u2013CoV originated from an animal reservoir and animals played a key role in the adaptation and transmission to the human population (Holmes, 2005, Li et al., 2006), accurate diagnosis of SARS\u2013CoV infection among different animals species should be an important and integral part of an effective prevention strategy for reducing animal-to-human transmission.",

Based on the results above, it was evident to us that a cELISA based on either mAb F26G8 or the chicken mono-specific antibodies might be ideal for such an application. To confirm this, three separate cELISAs were developed and tested against a panel of negative and positive SARS\u2013CoV sera from different species. Firstly, a cELISA based on mAb F26G8 was tested against a panel of known positive and negative sera from different species, and the results in Fig. 4\nsuggested that each serum was able to inhibit F26G8 binding, with the civet sera displaying the strongest inhibition.",

First, there are more than a dozen animal species known to be susceptible to SARS\u2013CoV by either natural or experimental infection (Wang et al., 2006), and it is likely that more animal species could be susceptible too. It is important to differentiate between those which play a key role in the origin and transmission of SARS\u2013CoV and those that are infected, but play no significant role in disease spread and spill over to the human population. Secondly, there is a lack of an ideal detection approach to monitor infection status of different animal species. The most commonly used tool is direct PCR analysis for the presence of viral material in animal specimens (Guan et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2005, Kan et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006, Tang et al., 2006). While this is effective to detect active infection, it is not very sensitive to monitor prior exposure in a given animal population. We believe that a serological test which detects SARS\u2013CoV antibodies will be a more powerful tool for investigation of SARS\u2013CoV prevalence among different animal populations.",

Secondly, if the animals were susceptible, this would provide us better quality reagent than that obtained from immunization with inactivated virus and adjuvant. The seroconversion data in this study indicate that rats, mice and rabbits are susceptible to infection of SARS\u2013CoV by the oronasal route. When the same amount of virus was administered subcutaneously and intra-peritoneally, none of the animals seroconverted (data not shown), suggesting that the seroconversion is due to the replication of SARS\u2013CoV rather than immunization and that the route of administration is important for the infection to occur.",

The two most immunodominant regions, S3 and N4, were identified for the S and N proteins, respectively. For the N protein, it seems that the C-terminal region is more immunogenic than the N-terminal region. For the S protein, the location of S3 (aa 402\u2013622) is consistent with previous studies conducted with SARS patient sera, which revealed that the immunodominant regions are located in the following regions of the S protein, aa 528\u2013635 (He et al., 2004), 540\u2013559 (Lu et al., 2005) and 441\u2013700 (Manopo et al., 2005).

Collection and purification of IgY antibodies from egg yolk have proven to be a very effective and economical way of producing large quantities of antibodies (Tachedjian et al., 2006). By collecting the lymphocytes (bursa or spleen) of antigen-sensitized chickens, the immune gene repertoire can be stored for later production of recombinant chicken single chain antibodies, which is technically less challenging than the production of rabbit or mouse single chain antibodies (Foord et al., 2007). The successful production of S3- and Nc-specific antibodies was confirmed by several assays, including IFAT, ELISA and Western blot. The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrated not only the specific staining of viral antigens in SARS\u2013CoV infected cells, but also the different staining patterns for the two antibodies. This was expected considering that S3 antibodies should react to the extracellular domain of the S proteins whereas the N proteins are known to be located intra-cellularly (Lai et al., 2007).",

For this reason, we have developed in parallel cELISAs using mono-specific antibodies as detecting antibodies.

It is also important to note that depending on the purpose of application, one may wish to use different assays under different circumstances. Although sequence analysis would suggest low probability of interference by cross-reactive antibodies to other animal coronaviruses, this is yet to be confirmed experimentally for the HRP-IgY/NC oscELISA. However, we are certain that this will not be an issue in the S-protein-based cELISAs. This was deduced from the preliminary data obtained with bat SL-CoV antisera in this study. It was clear that not all bat SL-CoV sera were detectable in the HRP-IgY/S3 oscELISA. The failure to detect some positive bat sera using the HRP-IgY/S3 oscELISA can be explained by the significant sequence difference present in the N-terminal half of the S proteins of SARS\u2013CoVs and SARS-like-CoVs (Li et al., 2005). The development of three cELISAs was intended to provide choices for different applications. If the most specific antibody test is needed to detect SARS\u2013CoV infection, the mAb-based cELISA may be the best choice. On the other hand, if one wishes to detect antibodies to all of the related SARS\u2013CoVs and SARS-like-CoVs, the anti-Nc-based cELISA will be more appropriate. The anti-S3-based cELISA will be most useful to detect antibodies for SARS\u2013CoVs only, but allow for sequence variations in the S proteins of different SARS\u2013CoV strains.",
