            "text": "A novel coronavirus outbreak took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019 (Wang et al. 2020). This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients (Zhu et al. 2020) and it has rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries (WHO 2020). This novel coronavirus outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine, and hedgehog, can be infected by different types of coronaviruses. Further sequence analyses of this novel and other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms, and it has been evident that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection pressures (Akashi and Eyre-Walker 1998; Percudani and Ottonello 1999; Pepin, Domsic, and McKenna 2008). There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the other is at synonymous codon level. The first one mainly originates from preferential usage of certain amino acids, for example integral membrane proteins maybe enriched in hydrophobic amino acids and respective codons (Perriere 2002). The synonymous codon usage bias in viruses can be driven by selective pressures from the host cells (Wong et al. 2010; Fan et al. 2015;Gu et al. 2019), and studies on different viruses have shown that selection pressures can be dominant in the evolution of codon usage patterns of the virus (Liu et al. 2011; Fan et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). Correspondence analysis (CA) is a tool for visualization high dimension discrete-state data, which has been applied in many codon usage studies (Perriere 2002; Charif et al. 2005; Wong et al. 2010; Lobry 2018;). The recently developed within-group CA (WCA) and between-group CA (BCA) are derivatives to the conventional CA (Lobry 2018), and the application of block structure in these methods allows separating the codon usage bias at amino acid and synonymous codon levels. As the natural history of the SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging virus might provide some novel insights.",

Our results suggest a complex genomic background in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which made its synonymous codon usage harder to differentiate from other genomic sequences in our WCA analysis (the distances between k-means clusters are smaller). Despite the relative proximity between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 at three-dimensional level, they were still at significantly different positions (Supplementary Fig. S6A). It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses. The difference in synonymous codon usage is largely explained by the first factor (more than 50%), and our analysis on codon usages suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending with cytosine (Supplementary Fig. S7). We also had similar observation for the membrane gene. Our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in membrane was most similar to P1E and CoVZXC21 (Supplementary Fig. S6B).

The codon usages of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins (Jenkins and Holmes 2003; Wong et al. 2010; Cristina et al. 2015). The bias in codon usage is a unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the \u2018signature\u2019 of a genomic sequence. Codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based analyses that focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level, whereas codon usage analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters. Therefore, codon usage bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits (e.g. virus origin, host origin, or some functions of proteins) of a genome. The goal of this study was to investigate the codon usage bias of betacoronaviruses. By studying the codon usages of these viruses in a systematic manner, we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of SARS-CoV-2, which provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2.",

The G + C content, especially the GC3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and viruses (Perriere 2002; Gu et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2010). The GC3 content has pronounced effects on our WCA analysis of the orf1ab and spike genes. The GC3 content was found correlated with high WCA values on the first factor of orf1ab. In contrast, codons ending with cytosine had lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7). The G + C contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed (Fig. 1A). This can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation. In addition to global CA analysis, the application of WCA and BCA can eliminate the effects caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage, respectively. These alternative analytical tools were important because the amino acid sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions of the translated genes. In contrast, mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent, as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein.",

The codon usage of bat coronaviruses is more scattered than coronaviruses of other hosts.

Besides bat-origin SARSr-CoV, the pangolin P1E also had similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels.

The genetic variability is extreme in spike gene (Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001), and this highly mutable gene may possess more information about recent evolution history. In our results, the synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of P1E and other phylogenetic relatives (Fig. 4A), which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene. Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and P1E were similar at amino acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to share a very recent common ancestor. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and P1E might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time. The amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 in membrane was clustered with bat SARSr-CoV, however, the synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses. Notably, in membrane gene, pangolin P1E had a more similar synonymous codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13. These findings suggest that there may be different selection forces between genes. Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2. The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene.",

Some researchers have hypothesized that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host (Ji et al. 2020). However, our recent study on influenza A viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the codon usage of a viral genome (Gu et al. 2019). Our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of Betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage, which warrants more accurate but relatively conserved estimation. However, we also understand that the results from codon usage analysis cannot be deterministic or direct evidence revealing the origin of the virus. As the number of available genomic data is currently limited, and virus with high (>99%) genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 was yet to be identified, we cannot draw a conclusion on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 at this stage. Another potential limitation of the study maybe from the CA method itself. Although CA have been widely applied in codon usage studies in many different organisms, the codon usage data are usually not independent observations. The phylogenetic relationship among observations make it hard to differentiate source of the codon usage bias, as the codon usage bias may both affected by selective pressures and descent relationships. Unfortunately, there is currently no established method for adjusting phylogenetic relationships in CA analysis in codon usage data, an alternative method addressing the above concern is needed.",
