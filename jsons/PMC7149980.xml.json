In healthy rabbits, the nostrils are constantly twitching at a rate of 2-120 times per minute, unless the rabbit is at rest (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) or is unwell. The nasal cavity is lined with a protective layer of mucus that entraps foreign particles and bacteria. The mucus also prevents water loss and enhances the sense of smell. The nasal glands secrete serous fluid into the nasal cavity. In the rabbit, there is glandular tissue along the nasal septum and a cluster of glands, collectively known as the lateral nasal gland, occupy the entire wall between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (Bojsen-Moller, 1964). The function of these nasal glands is to moisten inspired air, which has a role in thermoregulation. The position of the conchal and maxillary sinuses and the structures of the nasal cavity are illustrated in Figures 3.9 and Figure 7.1. There is no frontal sinus.",

Pasteurellosis is not a recognized problem in wild rabbits but is a serious disease in colonies of commercial or laboratory rabbits. In pet rabbits, although P. multocida is found as an opportunist pathogen in many secondary infections, primary pasteurellosis is uncommon. It is usually encountered in the newly acquired rabbit that has recently been bought from a breeder or pet shop. Respiratory disease is the most common manifestation. Acute infections and septicaemia occur, especially in young animals, but chronic, insidious recurrent infections are more common in the adult pet rabbit. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis, nasolacrimal duct infections, otitis media, tracheitis and bronchopneumonia can all be caused by Pasteurella multocida. The organism can spread to other sites from the nasal cavity where it can reside as a commensal organism. Infection often persists despite mucosal and humoral antibody responses in addition to effusive neutrophilic exudation. The deleterious effect of pasteurellosis on laboratory colonies of rabbits and interference with experimental procedures has resulted in the evolution of expensive \u2018pasteurella-free\u2019 rabbits for use in research. The epidemiology of pasteurellosis is discussed in Section 16.5.1. Many predisposing factors trigger disease.",

The development of rhinitis and other respiratory tract problems in the newly acquired young rabbit is likely to be due to pasteurellosis. In the older animal, stress or poor husbandry can result in a flare up of a latent infection. Poor air quality, caused by high ammonia levels, or dusty hay irritate the respiratory tract and predisposes secondary infection. Many owners like to protect their rabbits from inclement weather by covering the hutch or placing them in a poorly ventilated damp shed during the winter months. Ventilation and good air quality is important in disease prevention. Pasteurellosis can be spread between animals and the disease is endemic in most breeding establishments. It often causes problems in premises, such as sanctuaries, where several animals are housed in close proximity. A distance of greater than 1.8 m (6 feet) or \u2018sneezing distance\u2019 is needed to control the spread of infection between individuals (Whittaker, 1989).",

Myxomatosis is another possible cause of rhinitis. Myxomatosis in rabbit colonies can present as rhinitis in association with ocular discharge. Aerosol infection is more likely to give respiratory tract signs that insect spread (see Section 16.6.1). Myxomatosis is progressive and almost invariably fatal.",

In many pet rabbits, especially lop eared breeds, it is difficult to visualize the tympanic membrane due to the presence of waxy ear secretion. Post-mortem examination of the horizontal ear canal of pet rabbits often reveals the presence of inspissated pus that occludes the horizontal canal. The presence of purulent material in the external ear canal does not necessarily signify the presence of pus in the tympanic bulla. Neither does pus in the tympanic bulla always cause otitis interna and vestibular symptoms (see Section 12.4.3). Radiological changes can often be seen as an incidental finding on skull radiographs (see Figure 13.2\n). It seems likely that rabbits with pus in the external ear canal and/or the tympanic bulla will have impaired hearing although they may appear clinically normal.

Acute upper or lower respiratory infections can be responsive to prompt antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. An antibiotic that is unlikely to cause diarrhoea but is effective against Pasteurella multocida should be selected. Examples include enrofloxacin, trimethoprim sulpha combinations, tetracyclines, parenteral cephalexin or penicillin. In vitro, most rabbit isolates of P. multocida are susceptible to penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, novobiocin and nitrofurans with a variable susceptibility to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and sulphonamides. P. multocida is usually resistant to clindamycin and lincomycin (Manning et al., 1989). Penicillin has been used widely to treat rhinitis in laboratory rabbits (Gaertner, 1991). Concurrent infection with other pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica can affect the response to therapy. Tilmicosin is an effective antibiotic in the treatment of acute pasteurellosis in sheep and has been used to treat rabbits despite the possibility of a fatal adverse reaction to the drug (see Section 4.2.1.11).",

Bulla osteotomy has been suggested as a treatment for rabbits with severe, refractory, chronic otitis media in association with vestibular signs such as head tilt and anorexia (Redrobe, 2000). The surgical technique has been described (Swindle and Shealy, 1996; Redrobe, 2000), but there are no follow-up reports of the success of the procedure.

Dry airways result in increased viscosity of secretions, decreased ciliary function, inflammation, and degeneration of the mucosa. The inclusion of fresh leafy vegetables in the diet can increase a rabbit's fluid intake. Water can be added to inspired gases by the use of humidifiers or placing the rabbit in a steamed-up room such as a bathroom. Nebulization is sometimes used as a method of introducing antibiotic, decongestants and other agents directly into the respiratory tract and to loosen secretions and bring relief. Nebulization introduces charged particles into the respiratory tract as an aerosol. In other species, nebulization is used to treat lower respiratory tract disease. Medication introduced by nebulization is unlikely to reach the tympanic bullae or paranasal sinuses or to penetrate thick mucopurulent exudate in rabbits. Mucolytic agents such as bromexine or N-acetyl-cysteine have been recommended for nebulization in rabbits with rhinitis (Meredith, 2000). In other species, N-acetyl-cysteine is irritating to mucosal surfaces and can inactivate certain antibiotics when it is mixed with them (McKiernan, 1983). Systemic bromhexine (Bisolvon, Boehringer Ingelheim) can be used as a mucolytic in rabbits. In cattle and pigs, when bromhexine is administered simultaneously with oxytetracycline, the antibiotic in the bronchial mucus is considerably increased (product datasheet).",

Foreign material can also be flushed out during the procedure. Nasal flushing in rabbits poses problems due to the small nasopharynx and inaccessible larynx. Great care is required to prevent purulent material entering the larynx and trachea. Endotracheal intubation is mandatory and the rabbit should be positioned so fluid drains out of the mouth. The nasal passages are examined using a rigid endoscope such as a 1.9 mm needlescope (Stortz) and irrigation sheath. The endoscope can go from the nostril to the nasopharynx via the ventral meatus and can also be used to explore the turbinate area.",

Some rabbits with upper respiratory tract disease are dyspnoeic because they cannot breathe through their nose. As in other species, external trauma can cause chest injuries and respiratory problems. Bite wounds from predators can penetrate the chest wall causing serious internal injury and introducing infection. A small external wound can easily be overlooked. Abscesses can develop within the thoracic cavity as result of haematogenous spread from other sites. Auscultation and radiology are useful adjuncts to clinical examination. Radiographic features of the normal chest are illustrated in Figure 13.3. Chronic pneumonia is illustrated in Figure 13.4\n.",

Encephalitozoon cuniculi has been reported as a cause of myocarditis in rabbits (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994). Stress and catecholamines are proven causes of cardiomyopathy and experimental models of the human disease can be provided by keeping rabbits in overcrowded conditions (Weber and Van der Walt, 1975). Myocardial necrosis and fibrosis have been recorded in rabbits anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine combinations by continuous infusion. Marini et al. (1999) postulate that hypoxaemia and coronary vasoconstriction result in cell death and necrosis. The rabbit has limited collateral coronary circulation and is therefore predisposed to ischaemia induced by coronary vasoconstriction. The authors draw an analogy with rabbits used as models of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in which alpha-adrenergic mediated coronary vasoconstriction occurs. Hypotension and hypoxaemia are further contributory factors.",
