It has become one of the hottest topics after the nightmare of the \u201c9/11\u201d terrorism attack in the USA, as this bacterium can be transmitted via the respiratory route from person to person [1], [2]. The pathogenesis of Y. pestis is poorly understood, although much progress has been made [1]. The availability of whole-genome sequences of Y. pestis will provide us with tremendous new opportunities for insights into bacterial pathogenesis [1], [3], [4]. As we run into the post-genomic era, there has been renewed interest in the crucial role that differential gene transcription plays in host-pathogen interactions [5], [6]. Genomic information, transcription profiles and proteomic analysis will be extremely helpful in predicting protein function and their likely subcellular localization, as well as to identify genes that contribute to virulence and pathogenesis. However, due to technological limitations, these advanced techniques need improvements to gain insights into the actual interactions between the microorganism and host in vivo.",

            "text": "Global regulation systems play an important role in modulating virulence gene expression. Deletion of virulence-associated regulator usually results in disordered expression of virulence genes and accordingly leads to the reduced virulence of the mutants. As a global regulation system, quorum sensing (QS) regulates a large set of genes involved in both basic cellular functions and virulence as shown in previous study [9]. Cell to cell communications by means of small molecules play essential roles in the synchronization of gene expression and functional coordination among bacteria [10]. Bacterial community behavior was first recognized over three decades ago when a substance produced by Vibrio fischeri was found to induce its bioluminescence at early stages of growth, which otherwise occurs only after bacterial cells enter mid-exponential phase [11]. This auto-inducing substance was later identified as an acylhomoserine lactone (AHL). Yersinia spp. also have QS. Using a bioluminescence AHL reporter system, Throup et al. identified the Y. enterocolitica as AHL producers [12]. Steve et al. characterized three AHL QS signal molecules produced by two QS systems, ypsR/I and ytbR/I, in Y. pseudotuberculosis\n[13]. Up to now, there are three strains of Y. pestis sequenced, CO92, KIM and 91001 [3], [4], [14]. In the genome of Y. pestis, two quorum sensing system was predicted: ypeR/I and yspR/I. However, until now their functions in pathogenesis has not been understood.",

The whole genome sequences of Y. pestis revealed that there are two QS systems, ypeR/I and yspR/I, in its genome [3], [4]. The QS double mutant was constructed by replacing the two QS systems with resistance genes, resulting in the mutant (QSM) with both genes deleted. The procedures used to replace the target genes are mainly as described previously [15]. Briefly, EV76 was made to be transformation competent and the \u03bb Red helper plasmid pKD46 was transformed into it, resulting in strain EV76/pKD46, which was then made to be recombination competent by inducing expression of the Red genes. First, ypeRI genes were deleted by replacing them with kanamycin gene, thereby generating the ypeRI mutant. The mutant strain was made to be recombination competent and the yspRI gene was deleted by replacing them with the chloramphenicol gene, resulting in the QS double mutant (QSM) with all of the four QS genes deleted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the correct replacement of disrupted mutant.

For calculation of the relative fluorescence intensity (FI) of a protein, the FI of this protein in immunized sera was subtracted from that of the pre-immunized sera. To determine the positive/negative results, the cut-off value was calculated as the average value plus two times the standard deviation of the FI from the pre-immunization sera.",

Antibodies to 40 proteins were specifically detected in the rabbits that had been immunized by the wild-type strain. T3SS plays a very important role in virulence [16]. Five T3SS proteins, including YscH, YscX, SycN, YscP and YscE, and 8 hypothetical proteins encoded by the plasmid pMT1 induced antibodies only in the rabbits that had been immunized by the wild-type strain. In contrast, only 4 proteins (YPCD1.52, YPMT1.34, YPMT1.46c and YPMT1.86A) elicited antibodies in the rabbits that had been immunized by the QS mutant strain. Because the repeated immunizations were required to induce the antibody according to our original experimental design, the live attenuated plague vaccine EV76 was employed to do this experiment. It is a drawback that it is not possible to compare the virulence phenotype between the mutant and parent strain. In another study in our laboratory we also prepared the QS mutants for virulence strain 201 and found that QS regulated some virulence phenotypes, including cytotoxicity to macrophages and virulence to mice, and other phenotypes, such as the clumping activity of Y. pestis (unpublished data).",

In contrast to the wild-type strain, the htrA mutant fails to grow at an elevated temperature of 39 \u00b0C, but shows only a small increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress and is attenuated in the animal model, implying a role in virulence [18]. The fact that antibody to HtrA was detected in the sera of rabbits that had been immunized by the parent strain, but not in that by the QS mutant strain, clearly demonstrated that the HtrA-mediated stress response is regulated directly or indirectly by the QS system in Y. pestis.

The genomic island YPO2087 to YPO2135 is predicted to encode a prophage [3]. Genes YPO2095 to YPO2135 constitute a 33-kb chromosomal fragment that was absent from the biovar Microtus strains. Y. pestis 91001, a member of the biovar Microtus strains, has a 50% lethal dose of 23.2 for mice by subcutaneous challenge, but 109 live cells of strain 91001 failed to cause any infection symptoms in rabbits [3]. This strain was avirulent to humans, as shown by the fact that 1.5 \u00d7 107 cells challenging through the subcutaneous route caused neither bubonic plague nor pneumonic plague in a volunteer trial [3]. Microtus strains are supposed to be avirulent to humans, although they are highly lethal to mice, so this fragment probably contributes the ability to infect humans in fully virulent strains [3]. Thirty-two putative proteins encoded by this fragment were included in the protein microarray; 18 (YPO2089 to YPO2134, and YPO2094 to YPO2135 in Table 1) of them induced antibodies in the sera from rabbits that had been immunized by the parent strain.

Through this system, Y. pestis injects the YOP effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells when docking at the surface of the host cell, thereby mediating resistance to phagocytosis. The antigenicity and protective efficacy of a portion of the LCRS components have been tested in previous studies; as well as V antigen, YopD was also found to provide partial protection against non-encapsulated Y. pestis subcutaneous challenge [20]. The immunization of mice with YscF resulted in a high anti-YscF antibody titer and provided protection against intravenous challenge with Y. pestis\n[21]. Thirty-one of the 43 LCRS proteins were included in the microarray analysis. Seventeen of these proteins were found to induce antibodies. Antibodies to YopM, YopD, LcrV, LcrG, YscO and YscG were detected in sera from rabbits that had been immunized by both strains. Antibodies of nine proteins, including YopE, VirG and YscE, were specifically detected in the rabbits that had been immunized with the parent strain; only the YscC antibody was specifically detected in those rabbits that had been immunized with the QS mutant (Table 1). Previous studies showed that LCRS is regulated by temperature, with most of the genes remaining inactive at 26 \u00b0C but are expressed at 37 \u00b0C. As both strains were cultured at 26 \u00b0C before being used for immunization, the proteins that were encoded by LCRS should be specifically induced in the host, and the differences in the antibody profile might result from the differences between the wild-type and the QS mutant strains during interactions with the host. YopE, a GTPase activating protein, is able to block CDC42Hs-dependent Rac activation and inhibit Rac-regulated actin structures, thereby interfering with the caspase-1-mediated maturation of pro-interleukin-1 beta of targeted cells, inducing de-polymerization of the actin microfilament structure and resulting in a rounding-up of infected cells [22]. VirG is predicted to be a Yop targeting lipoprotein, the function of which remains to be further investigated. It is assumed, however, that this protein might affect the targeting of some virulence proteins into host cells. It has been proven that Shigella VirG, a protein that is required for intracellular actin-based motility, induced autophagy by binding to the autophagy protein, Atg5 [23]. YscE, the smallest of the Yersinia secretion (Ysc) proteins in the type III secretion apparatus, is a dimer in solution [24]. Y. pestis mutants defective in the expression of YscE were unable to export the Yops [25] and, therefore, the pathogenicity of this bacterium is influenced by YscE, which is regulated directly or indirectly by the QS system.",

The antibody titers against antigen F1, as determined by ELISA, confirmed the results that were obtained from the protein microarray analysis (Fig. 2).\nFig. 3 demonstrates the feasibility of quantifying the abundance of antibodies by FI in protein microarray assays. The F1 capsule contributes to the high resistance of Y. pestis to phagocytosis by blocking the uptake by phagocytes, which probably relies on the disturbed interaction between Y. pestis cells and macrophages at the level of receptor interaction in the phagocytosis process [30]. The antibody titer to the F1 antigen induced by the QS mutant was lower than that induced by the wild-type strain, implying that the QS mutant might be more sensitive to phagocytosis than the wild-type strain (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The pH6 antigen is encoded by the psaA gene. Expression of this antigen is induced when the bacteria are grown between pH 5\u20136.7 and 35\u201341 \u00b0C [31]. These conditions are encountered in the phagolysome. As an adhesin, the pH6 antigen is expressed when bacteria are living within macrophages [32]. The release of pH6 antigen from these macrophages facilitates bacterial colonization of other types of host cell and also contributes to the delivery of Yops into these cells. The psaEFABC operon encodes a chaperone/usher pathway that is involved in the secretion and assembly of the pH6 antigen as a polymer (fimbriae) on the surface of Y. pestis in macrophages or extracellularly in abscesses [33]. Mutation at the psa locus results in a 200-fold increase in the LD50 of the mutant bacteria compared with the wild-type parent when mice are challenged by the intravenous route of infection, indicating its virulence roles [34]. The pH6 antigen was expressed in both strains, as indicated by the fact that antibodies could be detected in both strains. However, their antibody titer changes with the time point were different from each other in the sera of rabbits that were immunized by the two strains (\nFig. 4). The overall expression level of the pH6 antigen in the QS mutant was lower than that in the wild-type strain. In the wild-type strain, the antibody titer peaked at time point 4, but it peaked at time point 7 for the QS mutant, implying that the expression of this protein is affected by the QS system in Y. pestis.",

KatY with catalase-peroxidase activity is thought to mediate resistance to killing by professional phagocytes [35]. Our results showed that rabbits had a strong antibody response to KatY. The antibody titers to KatY in the sera from rabbits that had been immunized by the QS mutant were lower than those that had been immunized by the wild-type strain and the fluctuation trend of the antibodies is also different. The bacterial cultures that were used for immunization were cultivated at 26 \u00b0C, which indicates that KatY is expressed in vivo after injecting the rabbits. These data support the fact that QS regulates the survivability of Y. pestis in the host by promoting, at least partly, the expression of KatY.",

Previous studies show that it is tightly regulated by various factors that contribute to the highly efficient utilization of this system. The comparison between the antibody profiles induced by the two strains showed that antibodies to some of the secretion proteins were only induced by the wild-type strain, and some by both. For those induced only by the wild-type strain, it is easy to understand that the expression of these proteins is affected by QS. Detailed comparison showed that the expression levels of the commonly expressed proteins are different between the two strains. In general, the overall trends of the antibody titers to these proteins in rabbits that had been immunized by the QS mutant were relatively lower than those that had been immunized by the wild-type strain (Fig. 4).",
