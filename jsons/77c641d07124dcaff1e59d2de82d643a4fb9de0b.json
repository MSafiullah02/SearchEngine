MERS-CoV is one of the most common major causes for the increase in mortality among children and adults in the world [1]. The first identification of MERS-CoV was in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It spread rapidly in Saudi Arabia and many other countries and caused a large number of deaths [2] . Therefore, early diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection may help to control the outbreak of the virus and reduce human suffering. Computer and data mining techniques can provide great help in analyzing, diagnosing, and predicting diseases, and they can assist in controlling virus infection [3] .",

Apriori, Decision Tree, and SVM data mining algorithms are used on data of the spike in glycoprotein from the NCBI to distinguish between the two viruses. From the experiment, it is clear that distinguishes between MERS and SARS spike glycoproteins with a high accuracy. Table 1 presents a comparison of literature review that applied data mining techniques on medical data over the different categories. These categories are reference number, used data mining algorithm, used dataset, the objective of the research, used tool, and finally the outcome of the research. From the Table 1 , it can be seen that several algorithms and techniques have been applied to medical datasets and that the most common methods for classification are Decision Tree, SVM, and k-NN algorithms. In conclusion, in related studies data mining is widely used for the prognoses and diagnoses of many diseases. However, the datasets used in [6, 7] are limited and include the MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia from 2013-2015 only. It is important to increase the size of the dataset to cover new cases. Therefore, this study applied Data mining techniques using Decision Tree, SVM, and k-NN classification algorithms to a real dataset of MERS-CoV cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that was collected during 2013-2017.",

The MERS-CoV dataset subsystem aims to collect MERS-CoV data from different sources and integrate them into one database. The purpose of the supervised learning subsystem, which is the core of this study, is applying data mining techniques to build three different classifier models. Finally, the third subsystem consists of data scientists who analyze data and evaluate results. Figure 2 shows the overall workflow of the classification framework, which is divided into two main phases. The first phase aims to collect data of patients who are affected by MERS-CoV from different cities in Saudi Arabia between January 2013 and October 2017. The second phase is the most important phase. Its purpose is to identify the classifier model and evaluate the classification accuracy using cross validation test mode. ",

The best accuracy is for the binary-class classification based on healthcare personnel class with 86.44%, which was produced by SVM and Decision Tree algorithms. Figure 4 illustrates the result of the binary-class classification; when applying SVM with the healthcare personnel class, the margin width was maximizing, making the prediction faster and more accurate. On other hand, as healthcare personnel class became a root of the decision tree the depth of the tree was minimized and the tree is not complex that generates accurate predictions. Another important finding is that, for multi-class classification the Decision Tree obtains the highest accuracy with 42.80% based on city class. Whereas the accuracy of k-NN was 30.80% and SVM classifier was under 20% as shown in Fig. 5 . Moreover, for evaluating the effectiveness of the results of our method, we have to compare the experimental results with the results of a recent study [7] . A recent study [7] reported highest accuracy of 51.60% for multi-class classification based on k-NN classifier. This could be due to the value of parameter k that is set to 5 in this study while it is set to 3 in [7] .",

Therefore, using healthcare personnel attribute as binary-class may not be appropriate for MERS-CoV dataset classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the accurate classifier models for binaryclass and multi-class classification types are built by using Decision Tree and k-NN algorithms respectively. Additionally, the results of this study indicate that using SVM classifier is not suitable for classification of MERS-CoV dataset.

Additionally, using an SVM classifier is not suitable for classification of a MERS-CoV dataset. For future work, it is intended that this experiment will be applied to the universal MERS dataset. Furthermore, other preprocessing technique such as remove missing value can be used to measure its effect on the classifier models' performance. Additionally, other classification methods, such as ensemble learning, can be used. Also, another similarity metric, such as cosine similarity, may be used with the k-NN algorithm. Finally, for the multiclass classification, we suggest recreating the empirical study with different parameters to determine a classifier that gives accuracy greater than 50%.",
