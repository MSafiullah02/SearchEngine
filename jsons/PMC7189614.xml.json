For many nations this will add to an existing baseline of psychological pathology3 and low morale in the healthcare sector. Supporting the mental health of these individuals is a critical part of the public health response. The scope of the paper is to address some of the organisational, team and individual considerations for supporting staff (pragmatically) during this pandemic. The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we cover how staff may experience stress during a pandemic and in sections 3 to 5 we cover what organisations, teams and individuals can do to help, before concluding in section 6.",

Many of those aware of this and affected by it are in healthcare and adjacent fields. It is clear that even in the most perfect of scenarios, this pandemic would have overwhelmed existing resources because of the number of patients requiring intubation and intensive care, but it is also true that more could have been done in the time available to prepare. At an individual level, clinical decisions will have to be made which contravene the morals of those making them. For example, choosing which patients will not receive life support if there are resource scarcities. These decisions will be supported by protocol, but they differ from usual practice and guidelines pre-COVID-19. Already staff report being worried about having to make these decisions, having seen the experience of their colleagues in other countries, and they are experiencing anticipatory guilt19 while they wait for the peak to hit in their own countries. It will be essential for leaders at all levels to remind staff that they are not making decisions alone, that there is protocol, and also to recognise that these decisions go against the grain for many. It will be necessary to offer ongoing support to all staff, whether that is a local Schwartz round20 type gathering or something similar, in order for these experiences to be processed for some time after the most difficult phase of this pandemic has passed.",

An example of learning from a Toronto hospital in the SARS outbreak was that psychological drop-in sessions were more effective when they were offered in comfortable surroundings5 such as a room with sofas and music, and where senior staff also used the drop-ins. Remote psychological support such as phone, Skype etc. is indicated especially when the goal is having as few people on site and exposed to infection as possible. While peer support has its place, sometimes being able to offload to a relative stranger can be useful to staff, especially in order to acknowledge feelings they are struggling with such as fear, anger and a reluctance to come to work at all.",

Although there are many negative aspects of the current situation, teams can grow stronger, individuals can develop, relationships can grow deeper as a result of this crisis.

Know who forms your peer support network and where to access external support should you require it.
