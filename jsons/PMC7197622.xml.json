Although observational studies have reported improved outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia or sepsis receiving statins,3,4 most RCTs on inpatient statin treatment in sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect.4 On the other hand, statin therapy appears promising in the context of viral infections. Avian influenza viruses induce an intense host response characterized by a cytokine storm, which can sometimes lead to ARDS.3 Few large observational studies have reported the effectiveness of statin treatment in reducing influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths.3 Further, a recently completed RCT (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02056340) showed a significant improvement of symptoms in statin-na\u00efve patients hospitalized for seasonal influenza receiving atorvastatin 40 mg compared with placebo. An association between outpatient statin use and reduction in disease severity among patients hospitalized during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has also been demonstrated.3 Some authors have therefore advocated statin use as an immunomodulatory therapy for viral infections with potential for epidemics and pandemics.3 Although no RCT has yet investigated this hypothesis, statins [together with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] were effective in targeting the host response and preventing endothelial barrier damage in patients infected with Ebola virus during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa.5",

Some immunomodulatory therapies have indeed proven beneficial in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; for example, tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, was effective as a supportive therapy in selected COVID-19 patients.1 SARS-CoV-1 interaction with Toll-like receptors on the host cell membrane significantly increases the expression of the MYD88 gene, whose product activates NF-\u03baB, thereby triggering inflammatory pathways.6 Notably, inhibition of NF-\u03baB resulted in reduced lung infection and increased survival in a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 infection.7 Experimental models have demonstrated that statins stabilize MYD88 levels after a proinflammatory trigger such as hypoxia.8 Moreover, in murine cells, atorvastatin 0.1 \u03bcM (corresponding to the plasma concentration obtained with a daily dose of \u223c40 mg in humans) significantly attenuated NF-\u03baB activation within 48 h.9 (Figure 1). Based on this evidence, the use of a statin as an immunomodulatory treatment for COVID-19 patients may deserve consideration.\n",

Statin therapy has proven effective in improving hyperlipidaemia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving protease inhibitor treatment10 and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tocilizumab (Figure 1).2 Most statins undergo hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors currently used in COVID-19, such as ritonavir and cobicistat, could increase the risk of muscle and liver toxicity; therefore, starting with a lower dose of statin and monitoring creatine kinase and transaminases would be advisable in these cases.",
