Long-term software maintainability is often neglected, and a short-term perspective is pursued. Architectural layering and code smells are the typical results of such management, which drifts to poor software quality. This kind of pattern is well-known: it was named by Cunningham as Technical Debt (TD) [4] . A growing community holds that software quality practices to improve systems' sustainability (e.g., refactoring) is ultimately a business decision [10] . Even in the domain of open source software there is a trend into exploiting the concept of technical debt as intentional, hence strategic: see for instance the study on self-admitted technocal debt found in [7] .",

Maturity models (e.g., CMMI) are valuable frameworks to predict software quality according to the minimal software process requirements. Typically, for critical software, a CMMI level of 4 or 5 is required by contract. It should assure the customer that the software house undertakes full refactoring. Accordingly, the price per LOC incorporates this effort, increasing the value of software. On the contrary, to secondary software systems, which will be replaced soon, will be devoted less budget. Indeed, there is no economic rationality to assign the same relevance to a system's application or component. Thus, in a situation of limited resources, ones have to make choices and assign priorities. This means that not all software components will receive the same amount of resources, leading to different levels of quality within the same information system. Hence, it needs to be adequately managed, making such choices rational. Technical debt may arise from random processes and poorly managed development. Therefore, a management model helps to identify the sources of technical debt, so to assign them the respective priority.",

            "text": "The idea of technical debt is not a radically new one. In software engineering, we are well aware of software deterioration problems, where the complexity of software raises along with its evolution [11] , and reuse [2, 3] . Similarly, software ages when it is not able to cope with new requirements due to irreconcilable technology paradigms [15] . To better explain the concurrent drivers of technical debt, we elaborate on the idea of the Agile Triangle [6] . The three different dimensions of technical debt are budget, time, and scope. They are conflicting since it is not feasible to develop high-quality software with a low budget in a short time. This assumption is the baseline for any strategic software development model since you typically have to deal with limited resources. In an ideal situation, where resources are unlimited, there is no need for any strategic management effort, since strategic choices are simply not necessary. So, if we are focused on one corner, we are going to weaken the other two. If we are concerned about the scope, the relevant budget must be planned and sufficient time should be devoted to the project. If we need some new functionalities in a short time, it will have a high cost (since unplanned tasks require the organization to reschedule the work-flow), and quality will suffer from necessary fine-tuning before deployment, e.g., minor bug fix or refactoring. Finally, in case of a low budget, the project will last reasonably for an extended period, since few people can work on it. Moreover, the quality will also probably decrease since the most skilled (and paid) developers will work on other projects (Fig. 1) .",

Often, technical debt is caused by subsequent uncontrolled, unplanned, and irrational tasks, which led to an explosion of its interests. At that point, organizations typically struggle because they feel to be on a sinking ship, were new applications just increase the debt, and no exit strategy is planned because they often do not know where to start to repay it [16] .

However, we did not find in the scientific literature any similar framework addressing the social dimension. Therefore, we proposed a comprehensive managerial model. We pursued a theoretical mapping of the items within their related sub-dimensions. The outcome of the theoretical mapping for both technical and social dimensions is listed in Table 1 .

Benchmarking competitors is always a good idea since there is no such absolute baseline. Indeed, markets that experience continuous requirements adaptations at high velocity may generate more TD concerning those who have to follow standardized quality processes (e.g., CMMI). 2. Strategy Formulation. After the assessment phase, the organization should draw its strategy to manage technical debt. Each strategy has four main pillars [19] . To make it self-evident, we propose key questions, useful to draw a strategy: -Mission: why should an organization exploit TD? -Objective: which results do we want to accomplish, and by when? -Strategy: which plan do we define to achieve mission & objectives? -Policies: which internal guidelines for TD decision making do we want to have? Of course, these are high-level questions, which need to be tailored to any organization. However, they provide good-enough fit for every organization which aim is to manage its TD strategically. 3. Strategy Implementation. Once the planning activity has been concluded, the strategy should carry on.",

Continuous code inspection with quality metrics is a valuable example of this step. These kinds of plans have a price, which needs an ad hoc budget. Notably, every activity with no budget is poorly effective; thus, every organization should allocate enough resources. Otherwise, an STDMM is rather useless. Finally, procedures, intended as a sequence of steps needed to manage TD, are also part of the model. The aim is to leverage on TD to finance urgent software development needs or to repay it. However, how to manage these decisions in a complex organization is not trivial. Therefore, internal procedures guide both developers and management to use TD strategically. 4. Evaluation & Control. The last phase accounts for the continuous follow up of the strategy. Although the technical dimension of TD is a well known one [14] , we introduced here also social aspects, which are equally important for an effective management strategy. We were able to elicit and validate through or research journey [16, 17] relevant social dimension regarding TD management, which is described in Table 1 .",

Moreover, the project team should be as stable as possible in time, as also suggested by Brook's law. Skilled developers on ongoing training are educated to deal with new complex tasks and technologies. For example, the presence of a training plan is a positive software quality indicator. Risk mitigation through contracts, which transfer TD to contractors (like Service Level Agreement), is a common practice for most organizations. These aspects poorly relate to technical assessment techniques of TD, although they have an impact on organizations. Thus, to effectively manage TD means to include risk and contracts within the strategy. Finally, any software is a collective product, which can be developed in different ways (e.g., internally or externally to the company). The involvement of stakeholders, especially outsources is a key quality issue. Continuous interaction is an effective way to have a complete overview of the development process and the use of TD. This is even more important for an outsourced project, where the customer typically has poor visibility about what is happening.",
