The sample included 1946 subjects (mean age 58.8y; 45.7% males). 177 persons deceased, 39 after a mean of 11.7 days of follow-up. From March to April, the case-fatality rate significantly decreased in 40 the total sample (10.8% versus 6.0%; p<0.001), and in any subgroup of patients. Large reductions of the 41 lethality were observed among the elderly (from 30.0% to 13.4%), and subjects with hypertension (23.0% to 42 12.1%), diabetes (30.3% to 8.4%), CVD (31.5% to 12.1%), COPD (29.7% to 11.4%), and renal disease 43 (32.3% to 11.5%). In April, the adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.42 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.29-44 0.60). The mean age of those who died substantially increased from March (77.9\u00b110.8y) to April 45 (86.9\u00b17.7y).",

The potential independent predictors of death were then evaluated using 108 Cox proportional hazards analysis (using the data censored at May 5, to include \u2265 10 days of follow-up). All 109 covariates were included a priori in the model in their original form, with the exception of age, which was 110 treated as either continuous or ordinal, to explore the association between the outcome and several age 111 classes. Schoenfeld's test was used to assess the validity of proportional hazards assumption, and Nelson-112 Aalen cumulative hazard estimates to check the validity of constant incidence ratios during the follow-up 113 [12] . Using the data censored at 20 days of follow-up, a random-effect logistic regression was also fit, with 114 province as the cluster unit. The same above criteria were used to build the final model.
