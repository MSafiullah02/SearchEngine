We analyzed serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 6 ACAC patients for antibody cross-reacting with cerebellar neurons. Serum and CSF were obtained within 7 days of onset of pancerebellar ataxia from subjects aged 3.5 to 11 years. Varicella infection preceded 4 cases. Results of enhanced cranial CT scans were normal; CSF demonstrated 2-122 cells/mm3 with sterile cultures. Serial dilutions from 1 : 20 of serum and undiluted CSF were screened for antineuronal antibody by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using frozen, unfixed normal human cerebellum. Serum (1 : 400) was examined further for antineural antibody by Western immunoblotting using purified cerebellar neuronal extracts as antigen. Serum from age-matched, neurologically normal pediatric inpatients served as the control group for IIF and immunoblot experiments. In ACAC patients, no antineuronal immunoreactivity was observed by IIF. Immunoblots demonstrated no consistent pattern of immunoreaction when comparing ACAC to controls, though 1 patient exhibited distinct bands at 200 kd (neurofilament protein) and 54 kd.",

Studies were performed on a 1.5T magnet (Siemens Magnetom SP) with a circular polarized head coil. A three-dimensional time-of-flight technique was utilized. Occasionally, images were obtained after gadopenetate dimeglumine infusion. Two-dimensional projection images were calculated using a maximum intensity projection algorithm and recorded on laser film. Sixty-seven patients also had routine MRI. A sampling of vascular lesions was demonstrated. Nineteen patients had clinical and MRI evidence of stroke. MRA revealed intracranial vascular occlusion in 2 patients, diminished focal cerebral flow in the affected area in 4, and generalized ipsilateral underdeveloped cerebral circulation in 4. A Moya-Moya vascular pattern was found in 4 and sickle-cell vasculopathy was found in 1 patient. Seven MRAs were normal. Seventeen vascular hamartomas were demonstrated including 2 vene of Galen malformations, 7 arteriovascular malformations, and 8 venous angiomas. Three aneurysms were found. Thirty-one MRAs were normal. We find M U to be a valuable adjunct to routine MR imaging in the evaluation of pediatric patients with potential cerebrovascular disease. It demonstrates a spectrum of pathology, is noninvasive, and allows for serial follow-up examinations.",

            "text": "Angiography in Pediatric Cerebrovascular Disease P4. Thalamic Change in Acute Encephalopathy of adult rats. Twelve weeks after grafting, clinical and histological studies were performed. We developed a protocol for evaluating functional deficits that follow spinal cord injury in the rat. The survival, growth, differentiation, and parenchymal integration of the graft were documented histologically on semi-thin section. Animals that received the transplants demonstrated qualitative and quantitative improvements in several parameters of locomotion. Donor tissue integrated most often with the host spinal cord at interfaces with host gray matter; however, some implants also exhibited sites of fusion with damaged host white matter. We suggest embryonic rat spinal cord transplantation may be a useful treatment of spinal cord injury and a possible therapeutic strategy in human spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The basic neuropathophysiology of hemineglect after unilateral cerebral lesions is still not clear. One theory holds that degraded perceptual processing occurs in the damaged hemisphere due to intrahemispheric deficits. Another holds interhemispheric interaction at fault, with the intact hemisphere actively inhibiting spatial cognitive processes in the damaged one. We tested 11 adult Macaca fascicuhris with acute neglect on a task in which the whole visual surround was restricted to 15 degrees from central fixation, and a second in which an opaque lens occluded the eye either ipsilateral (ipsi) or contralateral (contra) to the lesion. Using paired t tests, in the first task there were no differences in reaction time to the ipsi and contralesional hemifields. In the second, there was no change in extent of the ipsilesional field (obtained with the contralesional eye occluded), as compared to its extent without occlusion. The contralesional field, however, improved significantly ( p < .03) with the ipsilesional eye occluded. Since reducing sensory input to both hemispheres leads to no worsening of hemineglect, but reducing sensory input to the intact hemisphere alone leads to improvement of hemineglect, we conclude that adverse interhemispheric interactions play a major role in the pathophysiology of hemineglect. We assessed the sensitivity and applicability of a new, cornbined cognitive and mood screening battery for multiple sclerosis (MS). Sixty consecutive, untreated clinically active MS patients, 30 each relapsing-remitting and chronic progressive, underwent the battery and head MRI upon entering 2 concurrent treatment trials. The battery combines the Faust-Fogel Brief Cognitive Screen and Visual Analogue Dysphoria Scale, both previously validated in other neurological diseases. Cognitive domains tested were immediate and delayed sentence and word-pair recall, verbal fluency, and conflicting response suppression. Patients marked ''usual mood\" along a \"happy-sad\" cartoon continuum. Relapsing patients were Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 235 younger (32.8 vs 41.2 yr mean), with shorter MS durations (6.4 vs 11.3 yr), and had lower Kurtzke Disability Scores (1.7 vs 5.8). Modified qualitative MRI grading (lesion burden, confluence, localization) was compared. Half as many relapsing patients (43% vs 83%) scored ''abnormal'' cognitively, despite similar \"sadness\" rates (20% vs 23%). Subjective dys-~ phoria in both groups correlated with denser periventricular lesion burdens. The battery was well tolerated and easily administered within 10 minutes without special equipment. This combined cognitive and mood screening battery is sensitive and convenient for clinically active MS. Alternate forms of the battery are needed for repeatability. Questionnaires may be reliable and valid supplements to laboratory tests for brain-damaged patients, as they can be applied to situations for which laboratory testing is not possible. We investigated the usefulness of informant-based data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing caregivers' subjective evaluations of 83 probable A D patients' performance on an abbreviated version of the Memory Self-Report Questionnaire to objective evaluations derived from an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests and to clinicians' evaluations. Similar information was obtained from 39 healthy agematched controls. Caregivers' subjective appraisals of patients' memory correlated significantly with objective measures of secondary memory, with all cognitive variables, measures of Activities of Daily Living, and clinicians' evaluations of dementia staging. Scores were independent of clinical indicators of depression. The abbreviated Memory Questionnaire showed good reliability, internal consistency, and external validity. Its positive predictive value is 63.5 and its negative predictive value is close to 100%. Results suggest that (1) informant-based questionnaires may be useful for obtaining valid information on cognitive ability outside of laboratory settings;",

Neglect was assessed by asking the patient and controls to bisect lines of 4 lengths oriented in 3 directions with respect to the body: horizontal, vertical, and radial. Our patient showed significant neglect of upper vertical and far radial space, as well as neglect of left hemispace. His line bisection errors were consistently in a direction opposite the slight directional biases shown by controls for all 3 line orientations ( p < .05). The magnitude of the patient's bisection errors increased by moving the lines toward the neglected sectors of 3-dimensional space. Neglect of upper vertical and far radial space was also evident on line cancellation tasks.",

The extent of this cortical localization and the nature of the pathological findings are not fully agreed upon, but spongiform degeneration and Alzheimer pathology have been described. Detailed examination of patients who are representative of the problem and have uniquely specific deficits is presented. One patient had visual associative agnosia, prosopagnosia, and transcortical sensory aphasia. Lexicosemantic experiments of categorization, word retrieval, and comprehension of auditory and visual stimuli showed a specific impairment of visuoverbal semantics. A striking preservation of phonological, orthographic and visual structural input, and intercategory dissociations was demonstrated. Consistency of errors argued for specific loss of semantic knowledge. Another patient with apraxia, primary visuospatial deficit, agraphia, and amnesia at the beginning had predominantly right-sided posterior cortical atrophy, demonstrating further fractionation of the entity and the striking specificity of visuospatial function.

            "text": "Permanent neurological deficits after ischemic stroke are mainly determined by the location and size of the infarct. Clinical recovery also depends on the functional state of adjacent brain tissue, where both neuronal loss and deactivation without gross morphological damage may affect flow and metabolism to a varying degree (G. Mies et al, Stroke 1983; 1422-27) , and where the ability to respond to stimulation by appropriate neuronal recruitment may be impaired. Therefore, degree of resting hypometabolism and of responsiveness to functional activation may provide a measure of prognosis. In 26 patients (age 60.7 10.9 yr) with aphasia consequent to ischemic stroke of the dominant hemisphere, regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGI) was measured at rest and in 17 of them also during spontaneous speech, using positron emission tomography (PET) of 2-(F18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-~-glucose (FDG). The PET study and a standardized neuropsychological test battery to assess the main aspects of language were performed around the fourteenth day after the stroke, and the language functions were assessed again 3 to 5 months later. Performances in various dimensions of language 2 weeks and 3 to 5 months after stroke were related to rCMRGl in topographically meaningful areas at rest and during activation using Wilcoxon-rank Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 237 sum test and multiple regression analysis. Severity of aphasia was assessed by the Token test, which showed a bimodal distribution to slight and severe, and a lower representation of moderate cases. Global and all regional CMRGl at rest and during activation were significantly correlated to scores in Token test at first and second examination, with the highest correlation coefficients ( -0.7 to -0.61) for Broca's, Wernicke's, and left temporoparietal regions. For performance after 3 to 5 months, the relationships were still significant with lower coefficients. Verbal fluency also was correlated to KMRGI, but with lower coefficients that slightly increased for the recovery state. Language performance at different stages in the course after ischemic stroke was significantly related (r = 0.84 for Token test, r = 0.93 for verbal fluency). However, there exists a high variability in recovery that may be explained by stepwise regression of metabolic values. Significant effects were observed only for CMRGl of the left hemisphere outside the infarct (partial R' = 0.21) at rest and for CMRGl within the infarct (0.27), the contralat-era1 mirror region (0.16), and Broca's region (0.17) during activation, with a sum of all partial weight factors of 0.46 at rest and 0.72 during activation. Our results furnish 2 indicators for recovery of aphasia: the resting metabolism of the left hemisphere outside the infarct, and the activated metabolism in residual tissue within the infarct and in languagerelated areas. Although the hemispheric metabolism at rest might be related to neuronal loss and thereby to the brain's reserve capacity, the extent of metabolic activation indicates neuronal recruitment and the capability of neuronal networks for functional recovery.",

Evidence for embolism generally has a presumptive component. To document further that cerebral infarcts in this model are indeed due to embolism, we studied the ultrastructure of the carotid thrombi and the presumed cerebral emboli using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). The right carotid artery of 9 Wistar rats was irradiated with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 15 min) following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin 11, 12.5 mgikg. Rats were sacrificed from 1 to 24 hours later. Endothelial damage with formation of a fragmenting thrombus, composed mainly of platelets and erythrocytes (with no fibrin in most areas), was present in the carotid arteries of all rats by SEM. SEM was done on 36 cerebral vessels, 3 1 containing peripheral blood elements, with single (1) and aggregated (6) platelets (causing occlusion in 3), single (10) and aggregated (10) erythrocytes (without occlusion), and single (1) and aggregated (3) leukocytes (without occlusion). TEM demonstrated that the platelet aggregates did not adhere to the cerebral endothelium. The endothelial surface of all cerebral vessels was normal, which provided additional evidence that the mechanism of cerebral infarction in this model is embolism.",

Canada There is considerable evidence that glutamate release resulting in activation of postsynaptic receptors (especially Nmethyhaspartate) is a major mechanism of ischemic neuronal injury. In vivo experiments have shown that a more severe release of glutamate may be responsible for the excessive damage seen with repeated ischemic insults. We have shown that in cell cultures the effect of brief repeated insults is more severe than a single insult of similar duration. In the present study, we tested the protective effects of CGS-19755 in a cell culture model of single ischemic and multiple-insult paradigm. In the multiple-insult paradigm, in some cultures CGS-19755 was combined with mild hypothermia to see if this would offer additional protection. CGS-19755 offered a dose-dependent protection in cell cultures exposed to a single ischemic insult. CGS-19755 was protective to cultures exposed to repeated ischemic insults. The protective effects were enhanced significantly when they were combined with hypothermia, resulting in almost complete protection of the cultures. The combination of therapies appears to be a valuable strategy in neuronal protection during cerebral ischemia.",

Volume expansion guided by target filling pressures has gained popularity as a means of preventing or reversing DCI; however, the adequacy of central venous pressure (CVP) as a reflection of BV in this setting remains unclear. We measured BV and CVP concurrently in 10 patients (5 males, 5 females; mean age 57 yr) 1 day after craniotomy (mean 3.5 days after SAH) and an average of 5.5 days later. The mean BV (mllkg) measured using chromium5'-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) fell from 69.7 to 55.3 (normal range 55-80), a reduction of 21% ( p = .05, paired Student's t test). Despite this, mean CVP (mm Hg) remained unchanged (7.1 vs 7.9). Similar reductions of plasma volume (2 1%) and RBC volume (24%) accounted for no change in mean hematocrit (33.2 vs 33.5).

We used the cell culture model of ischemia to determine if the effects of repetitive ischemia are similarly more severe in this model of ischemia. For cell culture, we used fetal mice cortical astrocytic and postnatal cerebellar (glutamatergic) granular neurons and cerebral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic cells. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (activity per gram protein) release in the medium was used as a measure of cellular damage. Compared to a single insult, there was a large increase in LDH release during repetitive ischemia in astrocytes (233 vs 7 5 , p < 0.02) and granular cells (129 vs 41, p < 0.001) (highly significant) and a modest (but significant) increase in the cortical neurons (11.6 vs 7.5 p = 0.05). The demonstration that repetitive ischemia produces more severe damage in cell culture would suggest that the mechanisms are not predominantly vascular. Cell culture could prove useful to study the mechanisms of neuronal damage with repetitive ischemia. We studied the spontaneous recovery of neurological function after acute ischemic stroke using a standardized stroke NIH Stroke Scale scale ( N I H Stroke Scale) to assess the extent of improvement, differences in stroke types, and early predictors of later outcome. We performed serial neurological assessments on admission; 24, 48, and 72 hours after admission; and 7 to 10 days and >30 days after admission. Twenty-six patients had presumed embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and 14 had a clinical diagnosis of lacune. Admission score was better in the lacune group compared to the MCA group. The mean scores for all patients improved by the 7to 10-day and the >30-day examination, but the degree of improvement was greater in the MCA group than in the lacune group at >30 days ( p < 0.004). The degree of change at 7 to 10 days correlated with the change in score at 24 hours ( r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and 48 hours ( r = 0.86, p < 0.05).

Controlling for the effects of demographic factors, vascular risk factors, alcohol use, and depression within the multivariate models, LI was a significant independent correlate of deficits in memory ((3 = -.40, p = .0002), verbal (p = -.28, p = .0025), visuospatial (p = -.51, p < .OOOl), abstract reasoning (p = -.31, p = .0029), and attentional skills (p = -.50, p < .0001). We further investigated the effects of infarct number, volume, and location, as well as atrophy, on global cognitive function within the LI group. The only significant independent correlate of global cognitive performance was a preponderance of left-hemisphere infarctions (p = -.07, p = ,0454).

Mobr, New York, NY Intracranial atherosclerosis has been found to be more frequent in blacks compared to whites, whereas Hispanics have rarely been characterized. Among 2 10 consecutive patients from northern Manhattan over age 39 hospitalized at the Presbyterian Hospital from 1990 to 1991, cerebral infarction occurred in 32 whites, 84 blacks, and 74 Hispanics. All patients had at least one C T scan, 96% had duplex Doppler, 94% transcranial Doppler, and 12% angiography. Strokes were classified as atherosclerotic (ATH), cardioembolism, lacunar, and as infarcts of undetermined cause. ATH was further subdivided into extracranial (EATH) or intracranial (IATH) . Overall, the frequency of ATH was similar in the three racelethnic groups (white 2096, black 16'96, Hispanic 2096) . The distribution of the atherosclerosis, however, was different in whites compared to blacks and Hispanics. Whites had more EATH stroke than blacks and Hispanics (white 17%, black 7 % , Hispanic lo%), while IATH was similar in blacks and Hispanics and greater than in whites (white 394, black 895, Hispanic 10%). Nonwhites have more IATH stroke than whites. The similarity in the distribution of atherosclerosis between blacks and Hispanics argues for shared environmental risk factors, rather than genetic differences. Ethnic differences in stroke risk factors may help explain differences in infarct subtype. We studied 10 mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with a series of \"0 water bolus positron emission tomographic (PET) activation studies, and compared them to similar studies in 10 age-matched normal controls. For each group, PET images were mapped onto the subjects' MRI scan, and results of a particular activation condition were averaged across the group. Naming a series of pictures (line drawings of animals) minus counting abstract designs as a baseline produced strong activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus only in the AD group. Silent reading of words minus viewing a baseline series of \"Xs\" similarly showed strong activation of the anterior cingulate gyms in the AD subjects but not the normals. Naming 1 block (activation condition) of 80% unnamed pictures, minus a second block (baseline) of easily named pictures, demonstrated much greater cingulate activation in the AD patients, for naming of the more difficult pictures. We conclude that this cingulate activation may reflect the greater involvement of an attentional network (of which the anterior cingulate is a part) in tasks requiring a higher degree of \"mental work\" on the part of AD patients.",

Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental, Mattis, and Blessed scales. We found that intergroup comparisons revealed decreased motion at the surface ( p = 0.001) and aqueous-hydrocarbon interface ( p = 0.03) and increased motion in the hydrocarbon core ( p = 0.01) of the moderately to severely impaired AD patients compared to the controls. In the AD patients, there were significant correlations between decreasing membrane surface motion and worsening Blessed scores (males p = 0.05; r = 0.7; femalesp = 0.04; r = 0.5). These findings suggest that molecules are being produced in the brain of AD patients that gain access to the circulation.

Six patients had clinical evidence of parkinsonism and dementia and at autopsy had 2 distinct pathological findings-PD and AD. These 6 cases could be classified as having simultaneous or sequential evolution of PD + AD. Those with sequential onset had PD before age 65 years but were inexplicably functionally disabled early on, whereas those with simultaneous onset manifested PD after age 65 years. PD + AD patients had rapid disease progression, shorter survival, poorer drug response, and more side effects of levodopa than PD patients. To study the prevalence ofwhite matter lesions in the general elderly population, and to investigate whether white matter lesions were relatively frequent in subjects with classic vascular risk factors and with hemostatic risk factors, magnetic resonance scans were obtained of 11 1 participants, aged 65 to 85 years, of the Rotterdam Elderly Study. The subjects for the imaging study were a random sample from the general population, stratified by age and gender. T2-weighted images were obtained in the axial plane. White matter lesions were considered present when moderate or severe periventricular hyperintensities or when more than 5 small focal lesions or focal confluent lesions were found.

History of stroke or myocardial infarction, presence of peripheral arterial disease, factor VIIc activity, and fibrinogen level were each significantly and independently associated with the presence of white matter lesions. Significant relations with actual systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure, with a history of hypertension, and with plasma cholesterol were observed only for subjects between 65 and 74 years. This study suggests that white matter lesions in the elderly may be related not only to the classic cardiovascular risk factors. but also to hemostatic factors. Joan M. Swearer, Paula Nelligan, Hanno Muelher, Beatrice Woodward, and David Drachman, Worcester, MA Although behavioral disturbances occur frequently in Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders, little is known about the factors that predict their development or predispose to their occurrence. In the present study we examined 2 sets of possible predictive/predisposing factors retrospectively for behavioral disturbances in 35 mildly to severely demented, community-dwelling patients. The factors examined included: individual distinguishing features (age, gender, age of onset, premorbid personality traits, prior psychiatric history) and dementia severity (dependence in Activities of Daily Living [ADLs) and self-care, duration of dementia, global disease severity). Spearman correlations and t tests were used to assess the relative influence of these factors on the occurrence of 3 types of aberrant behaviors: aggressive behaviors, disordered ideation, and motor abnormalities. Forty percent of the patients exhibited aggressive behaviors, 77% exhibited disordered ideation, and 63% had motor abnormalities. Neither a prior history of psychiatric disorders nor premorbid personality traits were associated with the occurrence of the target behaviors. Dependence in ADLs and self-care and greater global severity were associated ( p < .01) with the frequency and severity of aggressive behaviors, disordered ideation, and motor abnormalities. These results suggest that severity of dementia is a consistent and reliable factor in the development of aberrant behaviors, whereas preexisting personality traits are not.",

There were no significant differences within or between groups on several behavioral measures including the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Cornell Rating Scale for Depression in Dementia.

Mayeux, New York, N Y The etiology of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) is probably multifactorial but there may be a shared susceptibility for P D and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reliable risk factor interviews were conducted with informants of 15 1 nondemented P D patients (PD-D) and 65 demented P D patients (PD + D) enrolled in a longitudinal community study of PD. P D + D were older (78.9 yr) than PD-D (71.4 yr) and had later age at onset of motor signs (71.1 yr) than PD-D (64.8 yr) ( p < ,001). The frequency of smoking, alcohol use, head injury, and family history (FH) of PD did not differ but FH of AD was significantly more frequent in the PD + D group (OR 2.25, CI 1.01-5.01). Using stepwise logistic regression, only age of onset of motor signs 2 6 5 (OR 2.86), education <8 years (OR 2.53), and the interaction of age of onset of motor signs and FH of A D (OR 3.49) were independent predictors of dementia in PD. To address variable years at risk for development of dementia, life table analysis revealed the cumulative risk of A D to age 90 in first-degree relatives of P D + D was .312, and .119 in PD-D relatives ( p < .05).",

MO Vascular dementia (VD) is believed to account for 20 to 30% of all US cases of dementia; however, pathologically confirmed cases are quite rare. This discrepancy suggests that current diagnostic criteria lead to the clinical overdiagnosis of VD. Twenty V D subjects (mean age 78.5 yr; 9 men, 11 women) were diagnosed solely on the basis of the presence of dementia, a history of stroke(s), and a documented relationship of stroke to onset andlor course of dementia; ischemic scores (IS) and neuroradiographic findings were not used for diagnosis. Compared with 89 subjects (mean age 75.2 yr; 34 men, 55 women) with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), there were no significant group differences for comparable Clinical Dementia Rating stages of dementia for measures of language, Activities of Daily Living, or general cognition. The VD group scored significantly higher than the DAT group on the modified IS (F [91, 64] = 138.2, p < ,0001). All 27 autopsied D A T subjects had verified Alzheimer's disease (AD); 8 also had cerebral infarctions. The 3 autopsied V D subjects had 168, 160, and 55 cc of brain tissue affected by stroke; 1 (168 cc) also satisfied histological criteria for AD. We conclude that (1) the clinical features of VD and A D overlap considerably; (2) diagnostic criteria based on the temporal association of stroke with dementia may have predictive value for VD; and (3) the frequent coexistence of A D and strokes indicates that refinement of criteria is needed to distinguish \"mixed\" and \"pure\" VD. Clinicopathological correlation remains essential for any study of putative VD.",

We hypothesized that left-handed AD patients would evince more rapid deterioration and therefore die at an earlier age than right-handed patients. Subjects were 103 demented patients consecutively confirmed at autopsy to meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for \"definite\" AD. Handedness was determined from structured interviews with primary caregivers and validated for most subjects with the Edinburgh Inventory of Handedness. Age at onset of dementia symptoms retrospectively determined by caregivers was used to calculate the duration of illness at the time of death. Because of reported gender differences with regard to longevity, we first partialled out effects of gender before using hierarchical regression procedures to test the hypothesis. Four of 46 men and 2 of 57 women with definite AD were left-handed. The mean age at onset did not differ significantly between handedness groups (F [ l,lOO] = .82), but the mean duration of symptoms ( Alterations in the optical properties of brain can be used to detect pathological changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) and phase-modulation spectroscopy (PMS), we measured the absorption (Ua) coefficient, scattering (Us) coefficient, and mean photon pathlength (PL) of red light directed through the base of the frontal lobes of 28 patients with AD and 11 age-matched control subjects. The measured values and the asymmetry index (AI) (an indication of the symmetry of the measurements between the left and right side of the brain) were correlated with the severity of disease as determined by Mini-Mental State score. There were significant differences between the AD and control group for Ua, Us, PL, and the standard deviation of AI. There was no correlation between the MMS score and Ua, Us, or PL. However, the highest asymmetry index values were seen in moderately impaired patients , which suggests that the asymmetrical nature of the pathological process detected by optical spectroscopy is most marked during this stage of the illness. This noninvasive technique may provide a convenient method to detect and monitor the pathological changes that occur in the brain of patients with AD. Disease P41.

We investigated 3 components of Disease learning and recall to determine which aspect of memory function is impaired the earliest in incipient AD. Using the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, which is a longitudinal prospective project on AD and normal aging, we identified 34 patients with very mild AD (i.e., with a Mini-Mental State score of 24 or greater) and 34 age-and sex-matched controls. We assessed performance on 2 memory measures: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and the Buschke Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). The 3 parameters evaluated included a measure of acquisition, total learning over trials (TL), and delayed recall (DR). On the FCSRT, an index of facilitation of performance with semantic cues (SC) was assessed. Results indicated that all 3 indices, TL., DR, and SC, were capable of separating the mild AD group from the controls ( p < 0,001). Using a linear discriminant analysis with stepwise variable entry, the measure that assessed the patient's ability to use semantic cues (SC) was the most sensitive parameter for separating the 2 groups ( F = 15.38, p < 0.0002), and the acquisition parameter (TL) was also useful at adding some additional predictive power (F = 8.48, p < 0.005). The delayed recall measure, however, did not add anything to the previous 2 measures. It appears that very early AD can be detected using appropriately structured memory tasks, and these procedures can be helpful in identifying at-risk individuals. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has an insidious onset that is difficult to date reliably. We developed a standardized interview to provide objective criteria for dating the onset of 7 different symptoms (memory complainr, performance problems, language deficits, disorientation, depression, behavior problems, and psychosis), yielding an estimated disease onset date. Inrerrater reliability (ICC = 0.99;p < ,001) and interinformant reliability (ICC = 3 5 ; p < .001) for the onset of first symptom was high. Interrater agreement for the order in which symptoms appeared was high (ICC = 0.72-0.98) as was interinformant reliability for all symptoms except memory complaint. The interview was administered to 2 16 patients with AD. Mean estimate duration of illness was 4.26 years k 3.47 years and correlated significanrly with problems in instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Sixty-six percent had memory complaint and 45% had performance problems as their initial symptom. This technique provides a reliable characterization of disease onset. Longitudinal studies will determine if particular onset symptoms differentially predict disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an excess of white matter disease (WMD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brun and Englund (1986) reported an excess of WMD in brains of patients with AD vs age-matched controls. There have been reports both confirming (Bowen et al, 1990; Fazekas et al, 1990) and refuting (Leys, 1990) these findings using CT and MRI in patients with clinically diagnosed AD.

Most patients had classic features of PSP including ophthalmoplegia, postural instability, and extrapyramidal signs. Dementia was eventually observed in 9 of the 13 patients (67%). Six of 9 patients (67 %) on whom adequate initial documentation was available presented with memory loss or behavior change. Five of the 13 patients (395%), including 4 with an initial presentation of memory loss, were diagnosed clinically as having Alzheimer's disease (AD) rather than PSP; neuropathological diagnoses in these cases varied: I had combined AD-PSP; 1 had AD-PSP combined with Parkinson's disease (PD) changes; 1 had PSP-PD; and 2 had \"pure\" PSP. The 2 patients with concomitant PD changes showed Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, nucleus basalis, and neocortex. The remaining 8 patients were clinically diagnosed as having PSP; neuropathological diagnoses in these cases included 4 with \"pure\" PSP and 4 with PSP that also met neuropathological criteria for AD (PSP-AD).

Performance on the neuropsychological measures was examined separately for subjects with high (2 12 yr) and low (< 12 yr) education. Distribution of scores and basic descriptive information (means and SD) for each measure were determined. Significant age and sex effects were observed on most cognitive measures in the highly educated group. In contrast, no significant age effects were observed in the low education group. Effect of sex was not explored in this group due to the limited sample size (n = 48).

Because the previously described slowing of axonal transport in aged animals might lead to accumulation of cytoskeletal proteins in nerve-cell bodies and axons, we assessed the abundance of 2 major cytoskeletal proteins in brain tracts of rats at age 4 months or 25 months. Immunoassay was performed with monoclonal antibodies to alpha and beta tubulin and to NF-L (the core neurofilament protein) by published methods. Samples were dissected in a standardized fashion and 2-mrn pieces of the following tracts were assayed: optic nerve, corticospinal tract (medulla), superior cerebellar peduncle, L5 dorsal root, and L5 ventral root. Between 4 months and 25 months, the NF-L content approximately doubled in each brain site. Tubulin substantially increased at of Aged Rats all sites except the fimbria-fornix. In contrast, tubulin did not change in the spinal roots. NF-L increased slightly in the ventral but not the dorsal root.

Dose response to graded intravenous levodopa was measured after overnight drug withdrawal on 2 occasions, first after chronic, intermittent oral levodopa/ carbidopa and second after 3 to 5 days of continuous intravenous levodopa. Continuous intravenous levodopa shifted the dyskinesia dose-response curve to the right, and reduced maximum dyskinesia activity, but did not significantly alter dose response for relief of parkinsonism. Improvement in dyskinesia was apparent by the second day of continuous levodopa, during which ratios of plasma dopa/3-0-methyldopa remained constant.

An excellent response to L-dopa was noted in all 5 patients with continued long-term clinical stability for as long as 17 years. The 5 patients were the products of 2 consanguineous marriages, and their 7 siblings were normal. The patients were descendants of the same great-great-grandparents. This pedigree suggests an autosomal-recessive type of inheritance. We believe this is the first report of D R D with an autosomal-recessive type of inheritance.",

Severity was mild in 4 with sudden motor blocks mainly when confronted with obstacles; moderate in 9 with gait arrests upon any attempt to initiate walking and changing direction, requiring a walking stick or partial external assistance; and severe in 5 with total inability to start walking, requiring a walker, massive assistance, or a wheelchair. In all, freezing was associated with postural instability. They could mimic normal gait when seated or lying prone and could overcome arrests by the \"walking over lines\" maneuver. Neurological examination was otherwise normal with no signs of dementia, parkinsonism, or pseudobulbar palsy. Ischemic risk factors including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes occurred in 7 and previous strokes in 6. Brain C T and MRI were normal or showed mild cortical atrophy in 12 and putative lacunae in only 6 patients. None responded to levodopa or dopamine agonists. Progressive pure freezing gait should be recognized as a separate nonparkinsonian neurological entity. It may be due to degenerative or ischemic non-nigral brainstem lesions.",

There was spread of the causalgia and of the dystonia from its initial site both in the affected limb and to other extremities, the latter in a hemiplegic, transverse, and triplegic distribution.

McDemzott, Rochester, NY, Chicago, IL, and San Jose, C A The efficacy and mechanisms of levodopa (LD) drug holiday for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain controversial. We performed a double-blind, randomized study with 11 advanced PD patients (5 men, 6 women; aged 52-79 yr) with entry criteria of inadequate response to LD plus dose-limiting LD-induced side effects (dyskinesias, hallucinations, and confusion). Subjects were assigned to: (1) 100% placebo for LD (complete drug holiday) or (2) 50% LD and 50% placebo for LD (50% drug reduction) for 6 days. After subsequent open-label LD dose optimization, subjects were followed to end point (defined as the time when entry criteria were again satisfied or a maximum of 1 year). Median survival time to end point was not significantly different for the complete drug holiday (182 days) and 509% drug reduction (100 days) groups ( p = 3 5 ) . Aspiration pneumonia occurred in 2 complete drug holiday patients and no significant morbidity occurred with drug reduction. After a 100-mg dose of LD, clinical and pharmacological responses were no different before and after drug holiday ( p = .75) or reduction ( p = 254). Subject to the limitations of our small sample size, we conclude that complete drug holiday is associated with greater morbidity and confers no major advantage over 50% drug reduction. We found no evidence of significant alterations of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of LD after drug holiday or reduction. ( (PC) of the substantia nigra on T2-weighted images. The narrowing of the PC signal has been attributed either to atrophy of the PC or to increased deposition of iron in this region. We have studied details of iron distribution in the midbrain of 8 formalin-fixed human brains by scanning PIXE analysis. Three P D brains, 1 juvenile PD brain, and 4 control (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) brains were studied. In the controls, the iron content of the pars reticulata (PR) was almost equal to that of the red nucleus (RN), but that of the PC was less than 50% of the PR. In parkinsonian brains, the iron content in the PC was significantly higher than in the controls. The iron content ratios of PC/PR and PC/RN in parkinsonian brains were significantly higher than in the controls. These findings suggest that iron deposition increases in the PC of parkinsonian brains. The difference in the pattern of iron content corresponds to the intensity profile pattern noted on MRI. MRI findings in parkinsonian patients may reflect a change in the iron distribution pattern. (Jankovic and Brin, NEJM, 1991) . Such resistance within 2 exposures is not likely due to toxin antibody formation. Of 61 CD patients evaluated per protocol receiving 2 or more BOTOX Tx under multichannel EMG monitoring, 7 (11.5%) showed no benefit after the first and second Tx, despite mild neck weakness on static muscle testing and, in some instances, EMG signs of denervation. The 54 responders (16 men, 38 women) had younger age onset CD (mean 45 yr vs 60 yr), but similar duration (mean 10 yr vs 9 yr) compared to the 1 male and 6 female nonresponders (in contrast to Jankovic and Schwartz, Arch Neurol, 1991) . Both groups had similar degrees of severity and Tx dose (mean 200 IU, range 112.5-300). Although disparate group size prohibits statistical analysis, some interesting comparisons include: nonresponders were more apt to have extranuchal dystonic sites (72% vs 33%), antecollis (29% vs 4%), dark eyes (57% vs 19%), women with elevated antinuclear antibody titer (67% vs 24%), history of intracranial operation (29% vs O%), significant for age focal MRI abnormality (5 of 6 vs 3 of 19). History of cervical operation (6 patients) did not limit responsiveness. Rates of prior remission, perinatal stress, antecedent trauma, left-handedness, and family history of movement disorder were similar for both groups. Antecollis presents problems for optimizing Tx to affected muscles, but central mechanisms may play a role in why some patients with focal dystonia do not improve with BOTOX Tx from the outset.",

We investigated the presence and severity of OCS in a sample of 44 patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) using the Leyton Obsessional Inventory. OCS was found in the majority of the patients, with 24 (55%) scoring above the normative cutoff for the symptom score and 32 (73%) scoring above the normative cutoff for the trait score. When severity of OC symptoms was correlated with a battery of neuropsychological measures, significant relationships were observed between OCS and a preponderance of tests associated with right-hemisphere functions. These findings were observed especially on those tests with a strong frontal lobe component (block design: r = -.50; embedded figures: r = -.534; set shifting: r = -.42; and perseverative responses: r = .58; p < .005 for all measures). In all cases, the more severe OC symptoms, the poorer the performance. A similar trend was observed between the Leyton trait scores and the cognitive measures. These findings suggest that OCS is present in a subgroup of PD patients, which may reflect greater compromise of right-hemisphere basal ganglia-frontal lobe pathways. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were calculated for the total motor score and for each individual sign. Results indicated excellent agreement (ICC > .7) for the total motor score, resting tremor, gait, arising from a chair, and speeded, repetitive movements; good agreement (ICC > .5) for rigidity, action tremor, posture, postural stability, and bradykinesia; and poor agreement (ICC < .2) for speech and facial mobility. A factor analysis was then performed on UPDRS motor scores for 146 PD patients from a community-dwelling cohort. Three factors were extracted by principal components analysis with subsequent varimax rotation, accounting for 63.5% of the total variance: Factor 1-balance and stability (posture, postural stability, gait, arising from a chair, and bradykinesia); Factor 2-rigidity and motor speed (rigidity, speech, facial mobility, rapid alternating movements, leg agility, hand movements, and finger tapping); Factor 3-tremor (resting and action). These results indicate that the UPDRS motor examination is reliable between raters and measures the cardinal signs of PD.",

A previous report on the use of BOTOX for hand tremors suggested that it was helpful, but relied on subjective clinical rating scales. The extent of normal clinical fluctuations or a placebo response could not be determined. To investigate these issues more objectively, 7 patients with Parkinson's disease and 1 with essential tremor with refractory hand tremors underwent electromyographically guided intramuscular injections of BOTOX into wrist flexors and extensors. Patients without great medication-related tremor fluctuations were selected. Results before and after BOTOX were determined by comparing (1) patient perceptions of functional improvement, (2) clinical assessments using the Unified PD Rating Scale for tremor and the Webster Rating Scales, and (3) physiological measurements using accelerometric analysis of Hand Tremors of tremor frequency, amplitude, and waveform characteristics. All patients reported some improvement, ranging from mild to marked with a mean of 2.6 on a 0 to 4 (4 = marked) global rating scale. However, only 3/8 patients showed a significant improvement in the clinical rating scales, confirmed by >50% reduction in tremor amplitudes.

Using case control methodology, we matched each for age, PD duration, and sex with 2 control PD patients remaining at home. Parkinsonism was assessed by the motor and Activities of Daily Living subscales of the Unified P D Rating Scale (UPDRS); hallucinations and dementia were determined by scores 2 2 on the thought disorder and intellectual impairment items of the UPDRS.

Motor impairment alone and cognitive impairment alone were not significant risk factors for nursing home placement (x2 for motor severity = ,00084, p > .05, and x2 for cognitive impairment = .0023, p > .05). Furthermore, combined odds ratios for hallucinationslmotor severity and hallucinations/cognitive impairment showed no synergy of effect (x2 <1.0 for both,p > .05).

In one form, paramyotonia congenita (PC), the paralysis is temperature-sensitive, usually occurring with muscle cooling. Electrophysiological studies of muscle from patients with PC have revealed temperature-dependent alterations in sodium channel (NaCh) function. This observation led to the identification of 2 distinct mutations in an S4 segment of a skeletal muscle NaCh in 3 unrelated PC families. We describe the use of the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique to define a third allele specific to PC patients in an additional family. This aberrant pattern, though distinct from the first 2, occurs in the same exon of this NaCh gene. Sequencing is currently underway to define the molecular alteration causing this aberrant pattern. Two additional families with the PC phenotype have been sampled and do not demonstrate these 3 SSCP variants. We are currently searching for new mutations in these 2 families to define further the molecular heterogeneity of this temperature-sensitive PC phenotype.",

Attempts at reducing intracellular Ca content with Ca channel blockers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have been clinically unsuccessful. Dantrolene, however, which acts at the sarcoplasmic reticulum to inhibit Ca release from intracellular stores, has produced dramatic reductions in serum creatine kinase (CK) in dystrophic mice and more recently in DMD. We investigated the effect of low-dose dantrolene in a group of 20 patients with limb girdle dystrophy (LGD), DMD, and other myopathic disorders. All subjects received dantrolene in incrementing doses from 25 to 100 mg daily over a 6to 12-week period. Mean baseline CK was compared to CK with dantrolene treatment. Dramatic reductions in serum CK levels averaging 50% were seen at 50to 100-mg doses in LGD patients (8). DMD patients (3) and patients with other myopathies (9) showed a similar but less dramatic reduction in CK. Three of the weakest patients complained of increased fatigue while taking 100 mg, which suggests that higher-dose dantrolene may confound longer-term trials assessing clinical muscle strength and function. Dantrolene in dosages well below conventional antispastic doses has a dramatic effect on serum CK and possibly myofiber necrosis in LGD, other dystrophies, and other muscle disorders.",

Exposing mouse T-cell clones to MHC Class I1 molecules complexed with relevant antigen on planar membranes induced proliferative unresponsiveness (Quill and Schwartz, 1987) , and soluble MHC Class I1 molecules complexed with myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide resulted in unresponsiveness of specific Tlymphocyte clones in vitro (Sharma et al, 1991) . We have used our well-defined DR4-restricted T-cell clone (Ong et a [, 1991 ) isolated from an MG patient and specific for p138-167 of the AChR alpha subunit. Overnight incubation of these T cells with a soluble p138-167 : DR4 complex substantially inhibited the subsequent response to challenge with soluble antigen and presenting cells. In contrast, antigen response after preincubation with DR4 complexed to an irrelevant peptide (MBP 1-14), soluble DR4 alone, or An Experimental Approach Studied In Vitro p138-167 alone (at equimolar concentrations) did not differ appreciably from that in untreated cells. The p138-167:DR4 complex had no effect on other non-AChRspecific cell lines/clones. These results suggest that the use of soluble MHC-peptide complexes may be an approach to selective immunotherapy in MG patients.",

Dalakas, Bethesda, MD Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a severe disabling inflammatory myopathy with characteristic clinical and histological features. It is commonly suspected when a patient with presumed polymyositis does not respond to available immunotherapies. The need for an effective treatment in patients with IBM prompted the present pilot study using high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (HD-IVIg), an apparently effective immunomodulating agent in several autoimmune neuromuscular disorders. We treated 4 patients with muscle biopsy-proven IBM with up to 2 monthly infusions of 2 gml kg IVIg. After the first infusion, 3 of the 4 patients showed definite functional improvement consisting of independent ambulation, fewer falls, and increased ability to lift weights. The muscle strength of the proximal and less atrophic muscle groups improved by one grade MRC scale (from 4 to 5), whereas the distal and atrophic muscles remained unchanged. The improvement, sustained up to 7 months, was greater in patients with the most severe endomysial inflammation. We conclude that HD-IVIg may be the first promising agent that can improve the strength of certain muscle groups in patients with IBM. Because IVIg is prohibitively expensive, the present encouraging results warrant a large-scale controlled therapeutic study. Hays, and N . Lutov, New York, N Y , and Milan, Italy Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies from patients with neuropathy cross-react with the glycolipid 3-sulfated glucuronyl paragloboside (SGPG). Among 24 patients tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot, 15 had highly elevated antibody titers (56,400) to both MAG and SGPG, 2 had highly elevated titers to MAG alone, and 7 had highly elevated titers to only SGPG. Immunostaining of normal nerve myelin by the antibodies correlated better with anti-MAG than anti-SGPG activity. Twenty-one of the patients, including patients in all 3 groups, had predominantly sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy, and biopsy specimens revealed deposits of IgM and complement on affected myelin sheaths. Three patients presented with motor syndromes, all with antibodies specific for SGPG; 1 had a predominantly motor demyelinating neuropathy, 1 had upper and lower motor neuron signs and peripheral neuropathy, and 1 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis confirmed post mortem. All 3 had deposits of complement on peripheral nerve myelin sheaths. These studies suggest the following: (1) that anti-MAG or SGPG antibodies may differ in their fine specificities and biological activities, (2) that anti-SGPG antibodies also may occur in motor neuron diseases, complicating the clinical presentation, and (3) that both MAG and SGPG should be used as antigens in testing for autoantibody activity in peripheral neuropathy.

Williams, John Steele, Ulla-Katrina Craig, Sandra Bryant, Peter O'Brien, and Leonard Kurland, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, Mangilao, Guam, and Rochester, M N Continuing surveillance of neurodegenerative diseases in the Mariana islands reveals changes in frequency and clinical characteristics since the 1950s that resemble those in other known Western Pacific foci (Kii Peninsula, Japan, and Irian Jaya, New Guinea). Recent surveys of patients 50 years and older were conducted on Rota, Tinian, and Yigo, Guam. Possible cases of dementia, parkinsonism, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were identified by local trained personnel using a questionnaire, World Health Organization neurology test, and cognitive screening. Those who failed the screening were examined by a neurologist. In the small populations of Rota and Tinian, there were no definite cases of ALS compared to I to 3 cases present in previous surveys. The high prevalence of parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) was unchanged and dementia was increased compared to earlier surveys. In Yigo, ALS and PDC continue to be prevalent; however, the ALS patients are predominantly long-term survivors (> 10-year disease duration). In areas of previous high prevalence of ALS/PDC, dementia (as PDC) was associated with extrapyramidal signs, whereas in areas of previously low prevalence of ALS/PDC, dementia alone, possibly of Alzheimer type, predominated. These observations help to confirm previous reports of changing clinical patterns, but suggest that the geographic distribution of the (presumed) environmental etiological agent for ALS/PDC remains stable after almost 40 years.",

In 31 patients (48%), almost all with a severe grade of MD, 1 or more conduction defects were found: first-degree atrioventricular block (I-AVB) in 21 cases, second-degree AVB in 1 case, right bundle branch block in 3 cases, left anterior hemiblock in 2 cases, left bundle branch block in 2 cases, and trifascicular block in 1 case (pacemaker implanted). An 18-year-old boy had a chronic atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate; he died suddenly while awaiting electrophysiological study. Thirty-seven patients were followed over a mean period of 40 months (range 11-75 mo). A 54-year-old woman experienced a myocardial infarction and was excluded from subsequent considerations. Conduction defects de novo appeared in 6 patients: I-AVB in 5 and I-AVB plus 11-AVB (Mobitz I and I1 type) in 1. Nine patients, all with I-AVB at initial evaluation, showed deterioration of their defects' conduction: a bifascicular block was observed in 6 cases and a trifascicular block in 3 cases (pacemaker implanted). Conduction defects may run a malignant course in MD, mainly in patients with more severe grades of the neuromuscular disease; thus, a close cardiological evaluation is mandatory for a proper therapeutic approach in single cases.",

Ruff; Cleveland, OH Fast-twitch extremity muscle fibers are preferentially affected in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD). Since saccades are thought to be mediated by fast-twitch fibers, saccadic velocities would be expected to be decreased among these patients. To investigate involvement of extraocular muscle (EOM) by DBMD, we studied with infrared oculography 3 patients who were wheelchair-bound and able to perform only minimal Activities of Daily Living. Saccades were slightly slowed but were within 95% confidence limits of normal. All 3 patients showed square wave jerk movements (SWJ). In 2 patients, the frequency of the SWJ exceeded that of normal subjects, which suggested central nervous system dysfunction. Clinical neuroophrhalmological examination of 7 other DBMD patients was normal. This investigation is the first study of ocular motility in DBMD and demonstrates that EOM function is relatively preserved even in far advanced patients. EOM is composed of a heterogenous mix of fiber types that differ in anatomical and physiological characteristics from extremity muscle. Study of EOM in DBMD may prove to be useful in understanding why some muscles are resistant to DBMD and in characterizing properties that limit muscle degeneration. (Supported by NIH grants EY09186, EY067 17, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Evenor Armington Fund.) Since patients with myotonic dystrophy (MTD) exhibit a marked resistance to insulin effect on glucose uptake and an impaired handling of the insulin-sensitive amino acids, it is possible that muscle wasting in MTD may reflect a derangement of insulin action on muscle protein metabolism. Increased muscle protein breakdown in MTD would be expected if the normal inhibitory effect of insulin on protein catabolism is impaired. The forearm perfusion technique combined with measurements of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) arteriovenous (A-V) differences by high-performance liquid chromatography provides a unique method to investigate skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein degradation in vivo. We studied 3-MH (A-V) and efflux from the forearm muscles in 8 men moderately affected with MTD and 10 normal men. Efflux values (Q) were calculated as the product of 3-MH (A-V) times forearm plasma flow measured by the indicator dilution technique. Forearm 3-MH release (estimated as {A-V} or Q) of MTD patients did not differ significantly from normal controls. We conclude that myofibrillar degradation is not increased in MTD even when measured in a muscle compartment selectively affected by wasting. The possibility of an impaired anabolic action of insulin in MTD has yet to be determined.",

Patients with well-established mitochondrial myopathy syndrome and with myopathies known to produce secondary RRF were excluded. The number of ragged red fibers (RRF) was counted under 40 X (LPF) magnification. RRF were identified by the modified trichrome and SDH stain. For the final analysis, the SDH staining was used. The frequency of RRF was analyzed in relation to patients' ages. The frequency of cases with more than 1 RRF increased with aging: 0% in the first decade, 16% in the fourth decade, and 55% in the eighth decade. The frequency of cases with more than 10 RRF also increased with aging: 0% in the first three decades, 4% in the fourth decade, and 19% in the eighth decade. Of 25 patients with well-established mitochondrial myopathy syndrome, 24 had more than 10 RRF under LPF. The number of RRF in muscle increases with aging, indicating that mitochondrial activity in muscle is affected by aging. This finding may complicate the diagnostic criteria of mitochondrial myopathy in older individuals. Ten RRF under LPF seems to be a reasonable cutoff point for the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Schwartz-Jampel, a rare autosomal-recessive syndrome characterized by short stature, myotonia, skeletal abnormalities, and peculiar facies, was reported by Aberfeld in 1965. The same sibship was earlier reported by Schwartz and Jampel in 1962 with emphasis on blepharophimosis. As of this writing about 30 cases have been reported in the literature. Most of the features of this syndrome are believed to be secondary to primary muscle disease. Several peripheral electrophysiological studies showing features of myotonia have been reported. We describe 4 patients with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome showing evidence of central conduction disturbance documented by somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs). Median nerve SEPs showed normal latencies to Erb's point and N-13 in all. Interpeak latencies between N13 and N19 were prolonged in 3 with complete block in 1. EMG showed typical myotonic discharges in all. Motor nerve conduction velocities, visual and brainstem auditory-evoked potentials, CT, and MRI were normal in all. SEPs in the parents were normal. We believe this is the first report documenting evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and myotonic dystrophy may have similar CNS ''lesion'' as SEP abnormalities also have been shown in myotonic dystrophy. Epidemiological studies have associated consumption of certain batches of L-tryptophan (LT) with development of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). 1,1 '-Ethyledenebisltryptophan) (EBT or peak E), a derivative of LT, is a trace contaminant associated with implicated batches of LT. Three female Lewis rats received EBT, 4 mg per 100 gm daily, by intraperitoneal injection. Four control rats received unimplicated LT. N o peripheral eosinophilia, rash, or weakness were observed in either group. One rat from each group died during the experiment (control-bowel infarct; EBT-death under anesthetic). After 132 days, forelimb and hindlimb muscles of the remaining animals were frozen and fixed for Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 253 ultrastructural and histological studies. Two EBT rats had a myopathy involving soleus with a perimysial infiltrate containing lymphocytes, macrophages and sparse eosinophils, and necrotic fibers; the other showed few necrotic fibers in gastrocnemius. Occasional eosinophils were seen in fascia in both animals given EBT but not in controls. Fiber-type specific quantitative analysis of the microvasculature showed no decrease in the capillary index. Ultrastructural examination revealed an increase in the size of microvessels in EBT animals. No denervation or reinnervation were demonstrated.",

One woman (Patient 6) developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 5 years after numerous injections of free silicone into her face. Biceps muscle biopsy specimens in all 6 showed neurogenic atrophy. Patient 1 developed ALS with bulbar involvement and died 7 years later of respiratory failure. She had anti-GM1 antibodies and autopsy findings confirmed the diagnosis of typical ALS. Patient 2 developed ALS, but also fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and skin rash. She had anti-GM 1 antibodies, antisilicone antibodies, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and decreased serum IgG, IgA, and C3, but increased IgM and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and chronic inflammation was revealed in muscle biopsy specimens. Patient 3 developed ALS, but also had hair loss, skin rash, fatigue, headache, Sjogren's syndrome, and positive ANA. Patient 4 developed ALS, but also had myalgia and arthralgia. Patient 5 developed lower MND, but also fevers, arthralgia, and joint stiffness. She had anti-GM1 antibodies, positive ANA, antimyelin antibodies, and decreased serum IgG and IgA with chronic inflammation shown in nerve biopsy findings. Patient 6 developed a steroidresponsive and steroid-dependent ALS with bulbar involvement. She had a monoclonal gammopathy in the cerebrospinal fluid and increased CPK. We suggest that silicone acts as an adjuvant that damages motor neurons via an indirect autoimmune mechanism.",

In June 1989 she developed urinary incontinence, was found to have an open bladder neck. and underwent a suspension procedure for stress incontinence in January 1990. Eight months later she developed exertional fatigue and a diagnosis of M G was made. In July 1991 there was a recurrence of urinary incontinence. These symptoms clustered toward the end of the day and at trough Mestinon dose. Neuro-urophysiological studies demonstrated her previous open bladder neck, the inability to sustain a pelvic floor contraction, and increased bladder wall contraction. Singlefiber electromyography (SFEMG) recordings from the anal sphincter demonstrated a mean consecutive difference (MCD) of 88 ySec, and 11% of fiber pairs had impulse blocking while recordings in the extensor digitorium communis muscle were normal. Following a course of plasma exchange, there was significant clinical improvement with a reduction in the frequency of urinary incontinence, and improvement in anal sphincter SFEMG studies (MCD, 60 ySec with no blocking). This case demonstrates that in those myasthenic patients with predisposing bladder outlet dysfunction, urinary incontinence may be a manifestation of worsening MG.",

A 57-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma drveloped GBS by clinical, nerve conduction, and cerebrospinal fluid criteria. He had an elevated proportion of T cells and markedly reduced B cells with a normal CD4/CD8 ratio. He responded rapidly to IVIg, with return of nearly normal motor function in 1 week. Three weeks later, he relapsed and his vital capacity dropped. IVIg was again administered and within 24 hours he nearly recovered. A third relapse, 2 1 days later, again responded to IVIg. He has remained asymptomatic with IVIg maintenance. The role of T-cell lymphocytes in initiating experimental autoimmune neuritis has been shown by adoptive transfer experiments.

We observed significant inhibition of ConA-induced T-cell IL-2r expression in both MS patients (20.6% inhibition, p < 0.05) and controls (26.8% inhibition, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in percent inhibition between MS and controls, but there was more variance among the MS patients. Variability of biological effects of IFNP on T cells may relate to differential therapeutic responses to exogenously administered IFNP in MS patients. Preliminary experiments suggested that IFNP inhibited IFN gamma secretion by PBL stimulated with ConA. IFNP inhibits a number of events associated with T-cell activation, in both normal and MS T cells. Response to IFNP appears more variable in the MS cases. Immunological monitoring of T-cell activation in patients receiving IFNP may assist in understanding the observed therapeutic responses and planning clinical protocols.

Microglia cells participate in the pathological reactions of the CNS to multiple insults including trauma, inflammation, and neuronal degeneration. Functional roles for these cells could include mediating tissue in jury, promoting repair, or modulating immune responses. With regard to the latter, we have observed that the majority of adult human-derived microglia express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class 11 molecules under basal culture conditions, in contrast to astrocytes derived from the same surgical biopsy specimens. All morphological subtypes of the microglia (ameboid, bipolar, and ramified) expressed MHC Class I1 molecules, indicating a discordance between morphology and MHC antigen expression as markers of microglia activation. The microglia actively ingest myelin constituents, as assessed using fluorescein-labeled myelin basic protein and laser confocal microscopy. Autologous T cells (E') freshly isolated from the systemic blood and cocultured with Candida antigen underwent active proliferation in the presence of 1 to 10% microglia, indicating the functional capacity of the microglia to serve as antigen-presenting cells. y-Interferon augmented both MHC Class 11 expression and functional antigen-presenting capacity.

MRI studies show the disease to be more chronically active than is clinically evident, thus a single treatment is unlikely to provide lasting benefit. Recently, the Northeast Cooperative Treatment Group found that pulse cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m2 every other month for 2 years) slows progressive MS. We initiated a pilot study to determine the effect of a more intensive and prolonged pulse therapy regimen in both progressive and earlier stages of the disease. Pulse therapy was given after induction with either IV cyclophosphamide/corticotropin (600 mg/m2 x 5 over 8 days) or IV methylprednisolone (1 gm x 7 over 7 days). Patients received a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide (800-1,400 mg/m2) adjusted to produce leukopenia plus 1 gram of IV methylprednisolone monthly for a year, every 6 weeks for the next year, and every 2 months in the third year. Another group received pulse methylprednisolone without cyclophosphamide. As of this writing, 128 patients have been treated, of which 24 have completed 3 years. Interim analysis shows that patients treated with pulse methylprednisolone were more likely to become treatment failures than those treated with pulse cyclophosphamide/methylprednisolone (78% vs 45%) independent of induction therapy. Withdrawal due to toxicity, however, was higher in the pulse cyclophospharnide group. Current regimens involve methylprednisolone induction alone followed by pulse cyclophosphamide/methylprednisolone, analogous to lupus nephritis pulse therapy. This regimen can be given solely on an outpatient basis, does not cause alopecia, and is more amenable for use in earlier stages of the disease. To determine the incidence of pathologically confirmed malignancy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in funded clinical trials of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and of azathioprine (AZA), data were collected longitudinally using telephone interviews, written questionnaires, physical examinations, and medical records for CTX and AZA patients from a community in-hospital and out-patient MS clinic in Fargo, ND. In the CTX study (Goodkin et al, Arch Neurol 1987; 44: 823-4327) , 5 1 clinically definite (CD), chronic progressive MS patients were enrolled. Twenty-four were controls and 27 received a mean induction dose of 6.08 grams. Fourteen of the induced patients then received boosters every other month for 24 months resulting in a mean total dose of 15.92 grams. No malignancies were detected.

Twenty-five were controls and 29 received 3 mgtkg of AZA daily by mouth adjusted to maintain a white blood count of greater than 3,50O/cmm for 2 years (mean dose 2.6 mg/kg). Two of 29 AZA patients developed resectable skin cancers: 1 basal cell (BCC) at 18 months and I squarnous cell (SCC) at 43 months. The incidence of developing a BCC or SCC was not significantly increased after initiating therapies as compared to the untreated MS controls (AZA: Fisher exact testp value = 0.49).

Activated endothelial cells (EC) exhibit increased surface expression of immunorelevant proteins (ICAM-1; NCAM, ELAM, and MHC class I and class I1 antigens [Ags)). The sequence of events that characterizes EC activation may be important in susceptibility, induction, and perpetuation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study we examine expression of EC activation antigens in central nervous system (CNS) microvessels in response to interferon gamma (IFN-y). CNS microvessels from SJL and BIO.S mice were incubated for 18 hours in IFN-y (500 U/ml), fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with an antibody that recognizes class I, class I1 MHC antigens, ICAM-1, and factor VIII. Relative fluorescence intensity was determined using a laser cytometer. Results indicate that microvessels from all strains tested expressed no detectable ICAM-1 and class I1 Ags.

B1O.S microvessels exhibited ICAM-1 and class I MHC but MHC class I1 Ags were not upregulated. Results indicate that there are strain differences in the EC response to IFN-y. Resistance of B1O.S mouse EC to activation by IFN may be a factor in decreased susceptibility or induction of EAE, or both.",

The presence of antigenic epitopes shared by a stress protein and the potential autoantigen, MBP, supports the hypothesis that immune responses to stress proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of presumed autoimmune diseases such as MS. (1). Of 5 patients with borderline or positive CSF Lyme titer, 3 received parenteral ceftriaxone. All had later relapses consistent with MS. One patient received a month of oral doxycycline. The fifth patient had a negative Western blot and was not treated. We conclude that an incidental borderline or positive Lyme serology in an MS patient is unlikely to indicate neurological Lyme disease. Borderline serologies should be documented to rise on later testing; positive serologies should be confirmed by retest in a different laboratory or by Western blot. CSF abnormalities suggestive of neurological Lyme disease (pleocytosis, protein elevation, intrathecal Lyme antibodies) are distinct from those suggestive of MS (OGB, elevated IgG index, MBP). In such patients antibiotic treatment may be appropriate, but will not alter disease course. When designing and analyzing therapeutic trials for multiple sclerosis (MS), investigators commonly compare the proportion of patients in the experimental and control groups who worsen one or more steps on the Disability Status Scale (DSS) or Expanded DSS during the study (typically 2 years' duration). However, the intervals between the scores in the DSS may not be equal. It may be easier to change by one or more steps in the lower end of the scale (e.g., DSS = 1-3) than in the midportion of the scale (e.g., DSS = 4-6). To evaluate this possibility, we compared the proportion of patients who worsened by one or more steps in the 2 years after entering our program with DSS = 3 or with DSS = 6. Fifty-one percent (29157) Natural history data may be useful for designing therapeutic trials for multiple sclerosis (MS). Since 1971, we have collected such data in a standard format on patients in the UCLA Multiple Sclerosis Research and Treatment Program. T o describe the course in our group, we have performed survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) of patients with 3 or more assessments who entered the clinic with Disability Status Scale (DSS) scores of 1 to 7 (n = 395). An increase of one or more steps in the DSS score persisting for more than 3 months defines worsening. Median times to worsening for a DDS at entry of 1 to 5 were approximately 2 years (range 1.7-2.2); but were 4.6 years for DSS 6 and 3.6 years for DSS 7. For those starting at DSS 6 (n = 129), only 13% worsened by 1 year, 26% by 2 years, and 39% by 3 years.",

The severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is increased in SNS-ablated animals. Local parasympathectomy decreases plaque-forming responses in submandibular nodes. p,-adrenergic receptors are upregulated on CDS T cells in progressive multiple sclerosis, as are M,-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on CD4 T cells. We examined the effect of isoproterenol, a p-adrenergic agonist, and scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist, on the course of EAE in Lewis rats. EAE was induced by injection of 0.1 ml of incomplete Freund's ad juvant containing guinea pig spinal cord (25% wlv) and M. tubercdosis (3 mgiml) in one hind footpad.

The dissected plaques are lightly fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde and then suspended in 30% sucrose. Blocks are mounted in OCT, cryosectioned at 20 p,M, and picked up on gelatinized slides. The activity of plaques is determined by the presence or absence of myelin debris (antimyelin basic protein stain or Lux01 fast blue) or presence or absence of neutral lipids indicating myelin digestion as seen by oil red 0 (ORO) staining and the presence or absence of a Class I1 major histocompatibility complex antigen (evidence for an antigen-presenting cell) on macrophages or microglia as seen by immunocytochemically staining for HLA-DR (HB104 ATCC). The following is our classification of the activity of multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques. Type I, the most active, is defined as an area of hypercellularity, positive for HLA-DR with no O R 0 staining or staining for myelin debris. Type 11, or active, is defined as an area of HLA-DR-positive cells that stain mildly with O R 0 at the plaque edge but positive for myelin debris; evidence for demyelinating activity <72 hours (Prineas; Raine). There is an inner area of plump cells that are positive for HLA-DR and ORO. Type 111, or modestly active, is defined as a \"shelf\" of plump HLA-DR-positive cells at the edge loaded with Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 259 ORO-stained neutral lipid but a paucity of or no myelin debris. A region of hypocellularity is observed at the center of plaque. Type IV, least active or inactive, is defined as scattered HLA-DR-positive cells at plaque edge with little or no O R 0 staining and no evidence of myelin debris. The frequency of plaque types was determined from a random sample of 97 MS tissue blocks from 23 patients who died of MS. Ten percent of the plaques were Type I; 20%: were Type 11; 209% were Type 111. The majority of plaques (505%) were inactive (Type IV). Accordingly, it is necessary to classify the demyelinating activity of MS plaques for protocols designed to investigate etiopathogenesis. Do these results suggest that whatever causes MS can be eradicated in half of the demyelinating areas by the time of death?",

Helpers (T4) decreased from 1,436 in controls to 985 in migraine patients, and total ?' lymphocytes decreased from 2,513 to 1,698. Previous studies have revealed similar differences in T lymphocytes, with higher T4 : T8 ratios being found in both migraine and tension-type headache patients. In food-induced migraine, an increase in circulating immune complexes was noted, with increased T4 levels. Differences in serotonin binding to mononuclear cells have been noted in migraine patients. A decreased sensitivity of the lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor in migraine patients was suggested by one study. After lymphocyte incubation with IL-2, the natural cytotoxic response is augmented in cluster patients. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing receptors for IL-2 was decreased in cluster patients in a fur-Review of the Literature ther study. This IL-2 receptor defect was independent of whether the clusters were present. There is a loss of highaffinity binding sites for serotonin on lymphocytes in both episodic tension and chronic tension headaches.

Eighteen patients, all with history of diabetes or vascular disease, had normal MRI results, suggesting microvascular infarction of C N 111. In patients with CN I11 palsy, MRI can detect the presence of brainstem or cavernous sinus lesions and often can suggest their cause.

These are the fourth and fifth adult patients reported with the acute onset of stupor and opsoclonus; all patients had nonketotic hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality (rapid eye movement sleep also causes stupor and saccadic eye movements). Three of the 5 patients had myoclonic jerks in addition to opsoclonus. In the 5, opsoclonus began when glucose and osmolality acutely increased, and completely resolved when glucose and osmolality became normal, showing that opsoclonus is a specific and reversible effect of the metabolic disorder and implying that either acute hyperglycemia or hyperosmolality directly causes opsoclonus. Since acute hyperosmolality caused by NaCl or sucrose can cause a similar syndrome in experimental animals (Trans Am Neurol Assoc 1962; 87:33-36) and infants, hyperosmolality is probably more important. Opsoclonus is thought to be due to abnormal activity of saccadic \"burst\" cells in the pons. Acute hyperosmolality may cause spontaneous saccades by disinhibiting burst cells from normal \"pause\" cell inhibition or by directly activating burst cells. The combination of acute deterioration in mental status and either ocular flutter or opsoclonus should suggest acute hyperosmolality, in particular, nonketotic hyperglycemia. Neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and the related cell adhesion molecule L1 play significant roles in axon outgrowth and mediation of cell-cell contact in development, and after peripheral nervous system injury. To understand the role of these molecules after injury in the adult CNS, we studied alterations in N-CAM and L1 in the rat brain's response to entorhinal cortex (ERC) lesion. Post lesion, reactive synaptogenesis and axonal sprouting follow a well-defined temporal course in restoring the synaptic density of the dederented outer two-thirds of the hippocampal dentate gyrus molecular layer (ML) to near prelesion levels. We found striking regionand lamina-specific staining of N-CAM and L1 in the normal hippocampus and marked alterations in these molecules after injury. Embryonic N-CAM, present in high amounts during development but expressed at very low levels in the adult hippocampus, was massively re-expressed in the denervated zone; the embryonic form was still heavily expressed 60 days later, when synapse number returned to >SO% of prelesion levels. L1 staining, normally evenly distributed through the ML of the dentate, was completely lost in the outer ML, which is denervated by the ERC lesion. This staining had not returned by 60 days after lesion. Neural cell adhesion molecules play a role in specificity of neural connectivity both in development and after injury. In reactive synaptogenesis and axonal sprouting after injury, both ontogenetic (the reexpression of embryonic epitopes) as well as uniquely adult sequences of repair are utilized.",

Sensitive and quantitative measurements of leg weakness, one of the most common deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, can be made using specialized extremity testing equipment. To determine whether such determinations could be used in clinical trials, 6 MS patients with leg weakness that had been stable for at least 2 months were evaluated every 60 days over a 4-month period. Each testing session was carried out at the same time of day and medication dosages and schedules were kept constant (only 1 patient was taking baclofen and his dosing remained constant). Quadriceps and hamstrings strengths were measured in isometric contraction in a mechanical testing apparatus (Kincom). Variability for each series of determinations was expressed as the standard deviation of the mean as a percent of the mean. The overall variability then was expressed as the mean of the individual variabilities. The mean variability for the strength determinations over 4 months was 5.74 k 5.3896, and only one series of determinations out of 28 had greater than 20% variability. These results suggest that quantitative strength determinations might be useful in clinical trials, and early experience in trials of aminopyridines will be discussed.

Coxsackie genome was clearly identifiable in the muscle biopsy specimens of patients with PM but negative in PCR enteroviral-positive cases of PFS.

Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is a cause of adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis. In a specific population of Iranian Jews originating from the city of Mashad, there is a high incidence of HTLV-I infection (1 1.5%) and associated T-cell leukemia. We evaluated the incidence of possible correlation between HTLV-I infection and spastic paraparesis in Israeli Mashadi-born Jews. We have examined 41 Mashadi-born immigrants in a Mashadi Community Center (16 men, 25 women, mean age 66 t_ 13.7 yr) and 40 non-Mashadi Iranian-born Jews. Blood samples were tested for HTLV-I antibodies by particle agglutination test. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify HTLV-I sequences of D N A from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Twelve Mashadi-born immigrants (295%) were seropositive for HTLV-I. In 10 of those serologically positive for HTLV-I (83%), neurological examination revealed spastic paraparesis of varying severity. None of the non-Mashadi Iranian Jews were seropositive for HTLV-I or had clinical signs of spastic paraparesis. These results support other studies of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. The high incidence of HTLV-I-associated spastic paraparesis in the Mashadi community might be related to their unique history of a high rate of intermarriage among members of this ethnically segregated group. Further epidemiological studies are underway to evaluate the incidence of HTLV-I in Mashadi families as well as in Mashadi-originating Jews born in Israel, to identify whether infection might be genetically transmitted.",

The identification of these genes and gene products may clarify viral pathogenesis and also lead to the identification of genes that are important in normal CNS function and nonviral CNS disease. Members of the GDVII subgroup of TV cause an acute, fatal neuronal infection, whereas members of the TO subgroup are less neurovirulent and produce a demyelinating persistent infection. Our studies of infectious TV cDNA clones have demonstrated that the GDVII 1 B(VP2)-2C segment is critical for neurovirulence. Several other areas of the genome, including the 5' untranslated region (S'UTR), also affect TMEV-induced disease. The 5'UTR of poliovirus, another picornavirus, has a critical role in paralysis; this effect on neurovirulence is believed to result from an altered translational efficiency related to bind-Region ing of neural cell proteins. TV 5'UTR has an unusual predicted secondary structure, even for picornaviruses. Our studies demonstrate that the TV 5'UTR affects translational efficiency and has a distinctive protein-binding pattern. Investigations of the TV 5'UTR may clarify features of translational regulation of CNS genes in general.",

It is unclear why HTLV-I infection causes ATL in some individuals and TSPlHAM in others. Differences in the genome of viral isolates or immunological and host factors have been hypothesized to play a role in disease expression. At present there are no animal models of TSPlHAM and no suitable animal models of HTLV-I infection that can address these issues. We transplanted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from TSPlHAM patients in an attempt to produce HTLV-I disease. Two weeks after transplantation of PBM from 2 TSPlHAM patients, we detected anti-HTLV-I IgG in serum samples of 7 of 8 SCID mice by enzyme immunoassay using sonicated whole virus. Five weeks after transplantation, we detected anti-HTLV-I IgG to p19, p24, gp46, or gp61168 in serum samples of 5 of 7 SCID mice by immunoblot of disrupted virus. These findings suggest that SCID mice may be valuable in the study of molecular and pathological determinants of HTLV-I-induced disease. Theiler's virus produces an encephalomyelitis in susceptible mice. During the course of the disease, specific regions in the CNS become infected. Compared to the immunocompetent mouse, the nude mouse provides a useful model where viral dissemination can be studied in the absence of functional T lymphocytes and antibodies. We investigated the distribution and spread of the DA strain of Theiler's virus in the CNS of nude mice. By immunohistochemistry, the hippocampus, arnygdaloid nuclei, entorhinal cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus (anteroventral nuclei), midbrain, and spinal cord all contained viral antigens by 2 weeks after infection. In addition, the olfactory nuclei, mamillary body, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and nucleus raphe dorsalis often were involved. In the brain, the limbic system was the site commonly infected by Theiler's virus. The time course of virus dissemination varied depending on the site of initial virus infection, though the final distribution of virus was the same. Olfactory bulb injection, which is a direct inoculation into the olfactory pathway, resulted in more rapid spread than did cortex injection. We demonstrated the constant presence of viral antigen in the limbic system and a different kinetics of viral dissemination between the two different routes of intracerebral inoculations. These results suggest that limbic structures and their connections are important to the dissemination of Theiler's virus.",

The ratio of white matter pc to gray matter pc was 0.92 in PSVE and 0.87 in normals. In the frontal gray matter, the pc decreased in PSVE, whereas rCBF and rCMROz also decreased. These results suggest that tissue water content increases in the white matter lesions in PSVE reflecting the edematous status of the damaged regions. Elevated pHt with high pc may reflect the increase of extracellular water of the tissue. Measurement of pc and pHt provides useful information about the pathogenesis of PSVE.",

They included 775 cases of cerebral ischemia (CI) (51.4%), 467 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (31.0%), and 265 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (17.6%). Control data were obtained from 209 healthy spouses of the patients. Multivariate analyses showed that hypertension (HT) was the strongest RF for all stroke types and was followed by old age, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fibrinogen. The RFs for atherothrombotic CI included old age, HT, DM, smoking, fibrinogen, and cholesterol. For lacunar infarcts, HT, DM, old age, fibrinogen, alcohol abuse, smoking, and female sex were the significant RFs. HT was the cause of ICH in 347 (74.3%) and alcohol abuse (44, 9.4%) and vascular anomalies (32, 6.9%) followed. Most alcoholassociated ICHs occurred characteristically in the posterior fossa. Frequencies of hospital admission of ICH patients correlated positively with diurnal variation of temperature ( r = 0.5229, p < 0.001). Aneurysmal rupture was the cause of SAH in 222 patients (83.8%). Three major sites of 247 aneurysms identified on cerebral angiograms were the anterior communicating artery (83, 33.6%), the middle cerebral artery (70, 28.3%), and the posterior communicating artery (56,22.6%).

Frey, Phoenix, AZ Because precipitous neurological deterioration occurred during blood pressure reduction in a seminal case of lacunar infarction, 11 subsequent patients with partial or evolving lacunar deficits were treated with hemodilution and blood pressure nonintervention to test the hypothesis that lacunar strokes represent perfusion failure. Isovolemic hemodilution was performed using hetastarch with target hematocrit of 30 to 33. Results of pretreatment CT brain scans, carotid ultrasound, and echocardiograms were normal. Nine patients recovered normal neurological function, and 2 regained complete functional independence in close temporal correlation with hemodilution. MRI brain scans demonstrated appropriate single white matter lesions in 9 cases. No specific risk factor combination could be identified. N o patient has had recurrent stroke in follow-up from 12 to 30 months. Response to hemodilution suggests a hemodynamic pathophysiology. Successful treatment requires (1 } blood pressure nonintervention and (2) hemodilution prior to severe clinical deterioration. The hemodynamic classification for the carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) is important for the implication of prognosis and therapy, but satisfactory objective criteria for such differentiation is still lacking. Retrospectively, we studied the application of extracranial duplex sonography in 9 cases of CCF with emphasis on the hemodynamic parameters of resistivity index and flow volume. A correlation was made with the angiographic findings in an attempt to evolve an Objective hemodynamic classification by this noninvasive method. The Alterations in membrane metabolism and structure could be the primary etiological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that results in the clinical and neuropathological findings. To investigate in vivo brain membrane phospholipid and highenergy phosphate metabolism in probable AD patients and control subjects, the building blocks (PME) and breakdown products (PDE) of membranes and the high-energy phosphates PCr and ATP were measured noninvasively by in vivo brain 31P MRS in 11 probable AD patients ( 5 males; 6 females) and 18 controls (9 males; 9 females). All subjects were assessed by Mini-Mental, Mattis, and Blessed scales. We found that, at clinical onset, AD females had elevated PME ( p = 0.004), decreased PCr ( p = 0.001), and decreased ATP ( p = 0.03). Similar changes were not seen in AD males at clinical onset, but the severely demented AD males had increased ATP ( p = 0.05). Correlation analysis for the AD patients revealed that increasing dementia was associated with decreasing PME ( p = 0.05; r = 0.4), increasing PDE ( p = 0.08; r = 0.4), increasing PCr ( p = 0.05; r = 0.4), and increasing ATP ( p = 0.02; Y = 0.5). Similar metaboliccognitive correlations were not seen in the controls. These results demonstrate alterations in membrane and energy metabolism at the earliest clinical stages of AD. Increasing dementia correlates with markers of membrane degeneration and decreased utilization of high-energy phosphates. Both of these findings suggest the dementia in AD is secondary to membrane changes resulting in synapse loss.",

Petersen, Rochester, MN Hippocampal atrophy, defined by MRI-derived volumetric measurement, has been useful in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from normals. Since several studies have demonstrated anatomical and functional gradients along the rostral-caudal (r-c) axis of the hippocampus, it is tempting to speculate on the existence of a differential distribution of morphometric changes along this axis. The hippocampi from 19 patients with clinically and pathologically confirmed AD were studied by postmortem MRI and by reconstruction of serial histological sections. There was good correspondence between these two methods. The r-c length of the hippocampus in AD was preserved compared to normal. This length was longer on the left, both in normals and AD. The ADassociated atrophy was due primarily to the reduction of the coronal cross-sectional area of the hippocampus. With increasing hippocampal atrophy, volume reduction was more prominent in the rostral area (pes hippocampus). This nonuniform reduction in volume may be associated with different connectivity patterns between rostral and caudal hippocampus.",

McKhann et al (1985) provided clinical criteria for the categories probable AD and possible AD. The validity of these categories has not yet been reported. A retrospective, blinded evaluation of the complete neurological history, examination, neuroimaging, laboratory, and psychometric data was done for 68 subjects from the State of Florida Brain Bank. Pathological classification, which was blind to clinical diagnoses, was in 3 categories: pure AD, AD + , and other dementias. Ninety-three percent of probable AD (n = 42), whereas only 75% of possible AD (n = 26) patients, had AD or A D + ( p = 0.1). Pure AD was found in 62% of probable AD and 38% of possible AD patients ( p = 0.1). Pathological evidence of coexisting Parkinson's disease was present in 14% of all AD brains. These results suggest differential predictive power of NAC for probable and possible AD, as suggested by the labels. NAC are, therefore, usefuI for research and clinical purposes. Our prior study of falls in the elderly had shown significantly more white matter low attenuation (WMLA) on CT scan among fallers than nonfallers, but no association between WMLA and cognitive impairment among nondemented subjects. As these subjects were followed over time, it appeared that fallers were becoming demented at a more rapid rate than nonfallers. As a result, we analyzed the relationship between WMLA and rate of change on the Blessed Test of Information, Memory, and Concentration (BIMC) in a combined cohort of 144 subjects from the falls study and from a longitudinal study of dementia and normal aging. We selected 61 of these 144 subjects whose initial BIMC score was less than 25 (i.e., not already severely impaired) and who had at least 4 yearly BIMC evaluations. CT scans were scored on an 8-point ordinal scale for hemispheric WMLA. Linear regression was used to summarize the rate of change for each subjects' test scores. The rate of change on BIMC was 2.3 points per year with standard error (SE) of 0.2 among subjects who eventually became demented; nondemented subjects declined at 0.4 points per year with SE of 0.2. Multiple regression analysis was performed with initial BIMC score and WMLA as the independent variables and rate of change of BIMC as the dependent variable. WMLA accounted for 16% of the variance (partial r = 0.396, t = 3.26, p < .05).",

Both basal and fluoroaluminate-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly reduced in AD frontal cortex compared to control subjects ( p < 0.01; two-tailed Student's t test). In addition, a significant, though smaller, reduction in basal GTPase activity also was detected in AD frontal cortex ( p < 0.05). In contrast, no significant change in the activity of either enzyme was detected in the hippocampus. The stimulation of GTPase activity by muscarinic and GABABreceptor agonists was not altered significantly by the presence of Alzheimer's disease. However, the degree of stimulation was much lower in human tissue compared to that observed using fresh rat brain, suggesting that the ability of receptors to activate G proteins declines post mortem.

After controlling for age, education, age at onset, illness duration, and dementia severity (mental status and Activities of Daily Living), relative perfusion in the parietotemporal region (assessed using 133-xenon inhalation) showed significant correlations with job complexity (Pl: r = -.36, p < .008) and interpersonal (P3: r = -.44, p < .001) factor scores. In a stepwise multiple regression, job complexity and interpersonal skills increased explained parietotemporal flow variance by 7.5% ( F = 4.7, p < .05) over that explained by demo-graphic and severity indices; physical demands then accounted for another 11.5% of the variance ( F = 8.4, p < .01).

We report the frequency of clinical misdiagnosis of AD among 52 patients who at autopsy were found to meet the rigorous clinical diagnostic criteria imposed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) study. These patients included 31 men and 21 women (mean ages 78 and 76 yr, respectively) who were among the group of 95 patients who died in 13 CERAD medical centers in the US between 1987 and 1991. The clinical diagnosis of AD was neuropathologically confirmed in 47 (88.5%) of the 52 cases. Of these 47 cases, varying degrees of concomitant cerebrovascular disease were present in 26% and coexisting Parkinson's disease changes were found in 19%. In 4 of the 5 patients without neuropathological evidence of AD, the diagnoses were: lobar atrophy, diffuse Lewy body disease, nonspecific neurodegenerative changes, and mesocorticolimbic dementia, respectively. The fifth patient showed no morphological abnormalities. On the basis of these results, it would appear that application of strict diagnostic criteria, as well as the use of brain scans and detailed clinical and neuropsychological tests by experienced clinicians, cannot yet distinguish some types of primary degenerative dementias from Alzheimer's disease.

Samples of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex were dissected from 10 confirmed cases of OPCA and 11 age-matched controls. After processing, neuropeptide levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Concentrations of somatostatin were significantly reduced by 42 to 58% in 3 of the 4 cortical areas of OPCA brain that were examined. The area that was spared was the inferior temporal gyrus, a region in which somatostatin levels are markedly reduced in AD. Levels of neuropeptide Y were normal in all 4 areas, while concentrations of cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and substance P were significantly increased in 2 of the 4 areas. These data show widespread neuropeptide changes in the cerebral cortex of OPCA postmortem brain. In contrast to cholinergic markers, the pattern of neuropeptide changes is different from what is observed in AD.",

            "text": "It has been postulated that demise of the corticomotoneuron is the initial event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that the anterior horn cell dies as the result of antegrade glutamatergic excitotoxicity (Muscle Nerve 1992;15:219). Excitability of the corticomotoneuronal system can be tested by measuring threshold-to-cortical magnetic stimulation and the motor-evoked potential (MEP)/compound muscle action potential (CMAP) ratio, which estimates the number of corticornotoneurons stimulated. Cortical threshold and MEP/ CMAP ratio were measured in 39 patients early in the course of ALS. The mean time interval from onset of first symptoms was 8.5 months. Mean threshold and MEPICMAP ratio measured 64.2 f 16.6% and 22.0 rfr 21.2%, respectively. In 12 (30.8%) patients, threshold was paradoxically low (<55%, mean 49.1 +. 4.3%) and in 7 (17.9%) patients there was no response. There was a significant ( r Z = 0.698) inverse power relationship between cortical threshold and MEP/CMAP ratio given by 84.1 x MEP/CMAP-'j. Six months later, 7/24 (29.2%) patients still had low thresholds but the mean MEP/ CMAP ratio had dropped to 24.9 ? 24.5% and in 33.3% there was no response. We conclude that early in ALS the corticomotoneuronal pathways are abnormally excitable. This may explain early cramping and fasciculation, which characteristically diminishes as ALS progresses.",

The ratio of desmosine and isodesmosine was constant (1 : 3) in all samples analyzed. The decline in skin desmosine and isodesmosine is more rapid in ALS than in normal aging. Thus, cross-linking of skin elastin is affected in ALS. (Supported in part by N I H Grants DE 18522, DE 11233, DE 08611, AR 19969, AR 30587, and NASA grant NAG-2-181.) Pl69.

Integration of clinical and electrodiagnostic data to meet WFN criteria for possible, probable, and definite ALS was studied in this samegroup. Patients received 1.7 Ifr 1.1 (mean * standard deviation) electromyograms (EMGs) per patient and included 1.7 2 0.9 EMG levels (bulbar, cervical, thoracic, lumbar) per patient. Proportionately fewer EMGs were performed as the level of diagnostic certainty at presentation increased: suspected (34.3%), possible (31.4%), probable (25.7%), definite (8.6%). In only 4.8% of all patients studied did the first EMG alone change the level of diagnostic certainty of the diagnosis of ALS. Only 16.7% of patients presenting with suspected ALS alone or with possible or probable ALS were associated with a change in level of diagnostic certainty following 1 or more EMGs. However, although increasing the number of EMGs performed per patient may be associated with an increasing chance of increasing the level of diagnostic certainty (22 EMGdpatient = 33.3%; 2 3 EMGdpatient = 60.0%), selection of the level of EMG analysis was more crucial. The \"El Escorial\" criteria emphasize the importance of EMG evidence of lower motor neuron involvement in a limb with clinical upper motor neuron signs. Our analysis of EMG studies in autopsy-confirmed ALS patients suggests that complete evaluation of bulbar and thoracic levels for lower motor neuron changes and complete evaluation of motor unit recruitment patterns are important for the integration of EMG data with clinical data in the application of the \"El Escorial\" criteria for the diagnosis of possible, probable, and definite ALS.",

Subsequent investigators have inferred that purely genetic factors are not responsible for Guamanian ALS or its clinical variant, parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC). We report the first 4 Chamorro sibships selected in an ongoing study of 17 1 familial aggregations. The basis for the initial selection was that the youngest patient in the sibship had ALS. Age of onset was 30 to 46 years (mean 35 yr). Fourteen of 23 persons in these sibships were affected. Others in the sibship developed PDC, progressive supranuclear palsy, or pure dementia later in life (mean 61 yr, range 50-74 yr). These cases developed 14 to 47 years (mean 25 yr) after onset of disease in the first sibling. The age at onset of the first case and the intervals between earliest and latest cases in such sibships may help to determine minimal and maximal latency (i.e., interval between exposure to an exogenous agent and onset of symptoms). Our observations suggest that exposure may have occurred early (before age 30) with varying and often long latency (up to 47 yr). We also find that variability of clinical expression may be correlated with the age at onset. Concentrating on the study of familial cases on Guam may enhance the identification of the etiologic agent(s) of this prevalent and tragic disorder.",

Intrastriatal injection of inhibitors of complex I reproduces the pathological features of HD, and the neurotoxin MPP+ kills dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting complex I. Defects in complex I have been reported in HD and PD, but the distribution of this enzyme in the brain is unknown. To map complex I in brain quantitatively, we developed an assay using E3H)dihydrorotenone to label the enzyme in tissue sections. This high-affinity binding is saturable and is displaceable by rote-in Brain none and MPP+. Using 100 pM rotenone to define nonspecific binding, more than 95% of binding is specific. Highest levels of binding are found in kidney, followed by myocardium. Moderate levels of complex I are seen in striated muscle and some brain regions. Within the brain, binding varies more than 20-fold and is heaviest in the cerebellar molecular layer and dentate gyrus. Lower levels of binding are found in cortex and striatum and very low levels are located in substantia nigra. This assay may help to clarify the role of complex I in neurodegenerative disorders. ( In 1988, 4 patients with medically intractable Parkinson's disease underwent autologous adrenal medullary-to-caudate transplants at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA). These persons had been followed for several years before operation at 3-or 4-month intervals. At each visit, their disability had been rated on the quantified UCLA scale and the Hoehn and Yahr stage of disease. These provided a longitudinal assessment of the progression of disease in each patient, which could be compared to the rate of progression in the cohort of cases followed at UCLA for 15 years. In addition, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale provided supplementary data for the immediate preoperative and subsequent postoperative evaluations. The hours \"off\" also were recorded for the preoperative and postoperative periods. After operation, the same evaluations were performed by the neurologist who previously had cared for the patients. The longitudinal postoperative data revealed that at 1 to 4 months after operation, all 4 patients improved. After 4 years, 3 continue to be less disabled than their preoperative baselines. The progression of their disease, while still evident, is nonetheless proceeding at a slower rate than before transplant. The fourth patient had brief improvement shortly after operation, but then rapidly worsened to his previous level. His disease has continued to progress at a rapid pace, unchanged from progression before operation.",

Linkage analysis with 9 independent DNA probes or subsequent evolution to clinical HD (in 5 patients) allowed a risk estimate for 35 subjects. Twenty were considered to be at increased risk (?85%), 14 at decreased risk (<15%), and in 1 individual no modification could be given. Nine subjects were not tested. A PET scan was considered abnormal if either the caudate/thalamus ratio or the caudate/whole-brain ratio of rCMRGlu was more than these criteria, 8 scans in 6 individuals were abnormal.

Comparison of the ratios of increased risk, decreased risk, unmodified risk, and control subjects failed to show statistically significant differences (analysis of variance). Follow-up of 3 persons with an abnormal scan showed conversion to symptomatic status within 5 years after the first abnormal scan. This result suggests that an abnormal PET scan in a person at risk for H D heralds the onset of choreic movements. Robitaille, M . El-Awar, B. Clark, L. Scbut, M. Ball, L. Young, R. Currier, and K.

On average, dopamine levels were reduced in putamen ( -5396, as compared with controls), caudate ( -35%), and nucleus accumbens ( -31%). However, individual patient values showed a wide variation (normal to -9996), indicating that striatal dopamine loss is a common, but not constant feature of OPCA. Seven patients had marked putamen dopamine loss (-62 to -8195) but without corresponding severe substantia nigra cell damage; this suggests a \"dying-back'' phenomenon in which nerve terminal loss precedes cell-body degeneration. In this regard, OPCA may offer the possibility of examining nigrostriatal dopamine neuronal degeneration at an early stage.

L-dopa may precipitate or exacerbate depression in 30% of PD patients. To determine if L-dopa affects 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) metabolism, 8 patients were studied. Four had PD. Of these, 2 were taking L-dopa and both were depressed. The diagnoses in the remaining 4 were progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), striatonigral degeneration (SND), normal pressure hydrocephalus, and pseudoseizures with depression. Neuropsychological examinations and LPs of all 8 patients were done. Three patients were started on L-dopa (the 2 previously untreated PD patients and the PSP patient) and retested 3 days later. One PD patient started on L-dopa became depressed. Mood in the others was unchanged. CSF was analyzed for 5HT and 5-HIAA. 5HT could not be detected in the CSF of patients who were not taking L-dopa, but was easily detectable in all of the patients who were taking L-dopa. 5-HIAA levels were low in the untreated PD patients, and also in the patients with PSP, SND, and pseudoseizures with depression. 5-HIAA levels were even lower in the L-dopa-treated patients. The ratio of 5-HIAA:5HT (an index of 5HT turnover) was lowest in the L-dopa-treated PD patients who were depressed. Low CSF 5-HIAA in untreated PD may reflect depletion of brain 5HT.

The pedigrees contain 77, 206, and 376 individuals spanning 6, 7, and 8 generations with 7,6, and 9 affected members, respectively. Autosomal-dominant inheritance is clearly present in 2 families and probable in the third. Typical levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and impaired postural reflexes uniformly develops in affected individuals from all 3 families. N o downgaze impairment, pyramidal signs, sensory disturbances, cerebellar dysfunction, or orthostatic blood pressure changes have been observed. Dementia, however, has developed in a few elderly individuals, especially in 1 family. Laboratory studies are normal.

Barontini, Florence, ltah Many neurophysiological examinations were conducted of a 32-year-old woman with familial mirror movements. N o other neurological abnormalities were detected. Examination included voluntary electromyographic (EMG) activity from various muscles, F-wave as well as short-and long-latency reflex responses of the thenar muscles from electrical stimulation of the median nerve, mapping of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation, movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs). EMG documented mirror activity in the upper limbs, most marked in the muscles of both hands. Onset latency of EMG activity in response to an auditory stimulus was identical in active and mirror muscle. Long-latency responses from median nerve stimulation were recorded on contralateral as well as ipsilateral thenar muscles. Short-latency reflexes and F wave were strictly ipsilateral. Unilateral scalp magnetic stimulation evoked bilateral responses at similar latencies in the thenar muscles; midline scalp stimulation activated no responses. Scalp distribution of median nerve SEPs and of MRCPs associated with self-paced thumb abduction were normal. Our findings suggest that congenital inherited mirror movements in otherwise normal subjects can be generated by corticospinal fibers pro jecting to ipsilateral motoneurons of the spinal cord. We have previously identified dysphagia and constipation (both slow transit and defecatory dysfunction types) as common gastrointestinal (GI) problems in Parkinson's disease (PD). Since apomorphine has been shown to be capable of terminating off-periods when injected subcutaneously, we have evaluated the effects of apomorphine injection on objective parameters of dysphagia and bowel dysfunction in PD patients. Nine subjects underwent the following battery of studies to characterize their PD features, swallowing, and bowel function: GI assessment survey, Unified PD Rating Scale, videoesophagram, colon transit study, defecography, and anorectal manometry. Specific abnormalities on the studies were noted and the most abnormal study was repeated after subcutaneous administration of 6 mg apomorphine. All individuals were pretreated with domperidone 20 mg four times daily for 3 days prior to apomorphine administration. Improvement in both esophageal motility and deglutition was noted in the 1 individual in whom videoesophagram was repeated. For the other 8 patients, defecography or anorectal manometry was performed. Significant improvement in specific parameters was demonstrated after apomorphine administration, but 2 individuals experienced syncope during radiographic procedures. We conclude that subcutaneous apomorphine administration holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach to dysphagia and, especially, bowel dysfunction in PD, but that further investigation and refinement are necessary.",

Nittner, A. Kozrlosakis, P. Sanker, and V . Strum, Cologne, Germany, and Chicago, IL In the past, stereotactic operation was a regular treatment for unilateral tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, follow-up studies were usually short term and always unblinded. We examined 17 PD patients in long-term follow-up (mean 10.9 yr after operation) who underwent unilateral thalamotomy for parkinsonian tremor. We used videotapes and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale to blindly compare tremor ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of operation. Since the patients were specifically selected for stereotactic operation because of asymmetric tremor, we reasoned that a sign of long-term efficacy would be current postoperative reversal of tremor side predominance. Upper extremity tremor was significantly better contralateral to the side of operation compared to the ipsilateral side ( Z = 3.29; p < 0.023). For the lower extremities the difference was not statistically significant. In chronic follow-up, stereotactic operation improved the absolute magnitude of arm tremor or ameliorated its rate of progression. Since asymmetric bradykinesia and dyskinesia were not prerequisites for the choice of surgical side, we cannot make any conclusion about longterm impact of operation on these features.",

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated poorer neuropsychological performance ( p = .001) in PD patients on verbal memory, orientation, verbal fluency, visuomotor construction, and psychomotor speed, but not naming, abstract reasoning, or matching. Controlling for EPS severity abolished these differences. One hundred fourteen (37%) of the normal individuals had subtle EPS (mostly postural abnormality, bradykinesia, or rigidity) but no identifiable neurological disorder. MANOVA indicated poorer neuropsychological test performance ( j = ,001) in these individuals than in normals without EPS on verbal memory, orientation, abstract reasoning, naming, verbal fluency, matching, and psychomotor speed but not visuomotor construction. We conclude that: (1) cognitive impairment in PD is specifically associated with EPS, and (2) a similar association occurs in individuals with subtle EPS but no neurological disorder.

O'Brien, Rochester, M N , and Istanbd, Turkey There have been many studies of prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) in diverse populations around the world. To study the incidence, we took advantage of the availability of detailed health care records for the population of Olmsted County, MN, from Mayo Clinic, its affiliated hospitals, Olmsted Medical Group, county hospital, state hospital, records of solo practitioners, nursing homes, death certificates, and autopsy records. We reviewed all records with a diagnosis of HD, Huntington's chorea, chorea major, and chorea otherwise unidentified, and sought evidence for progressive chorea, progressive cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction, and family history compatible with autosomal-dominant inheritance with onset of symptoms in the period between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1989 , while the patient lived in the geographic boundaries of Olmsted County. We found 3 males and 6 females who met these criteria. Average annual incidence rate (age/sex adjusted to 1960 US white population) for HD for this 40-year period was 0.3 cases/ year/ 100,000 population. We also estimated prevalence by taking account of in-migration, out-migration, and deaths. The agelsex adjusted (1960) prevalence for 1-1-60 was 7.51 100,000 and for 1-1-90 it was 2.4/100,000.

Examination of the affected body part provoked or enhanced symptoms in all patients. Using suggestion and placebo activation in the form of a medicated patch, intravenous saline, or cervical massage, we first induced and then aborted typical episodes of their abnormal movements. Postinduction discussions of the procedure led to a marked reduction in the frequency of attacks in 2 patients. Activation procedures are useful in diagnosing psychogenic disorders because they demonstrate that situational, not medical, factors govern the expression of the abnormal behavior. We speculate that patients who are refractory to simple suggestion may respond to induction because it offers the potential of validating their symptoms. As in the case of psychogenic respiratory distress or pseudoseizures, positive induction can assist in counseling and symptom control. had Alzheimer's disease with parkinsonism (ADP), 1 had essential tremor (ET), 1 had cerebellar tremor in multiple sclerosis (MS), and 1 had tardive dyskinesia (TD).

However, the pattern of attentional impairments reported in ADHD has not been observed in TS. We therefore compared 17 TS patients (9 male, 8 female; mean age 32 ? 11 yr), 17 ADHD patients (8 male, 9 female; 36 * 12 yr), and 17 normal controls (8 male, 9 female; 3 1 ? 9 yr) on specific neuropsychological (NP) and computer-administered tasks of attentional ability. ADHD, but not TS, subjects performed significantly worse than controls on the N P tasks (digit symbol, perceptual speed) and had a trend toward poorer performance on a computerized measure of attention. However, both the ADHD and TS groups had significantly greater test performance variability on some, but not all, tasks and had more subjects with deviant scores. Among TS patients, higher scores on an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) inventory and a greater number of ADHD symptoms correlated significantly with poorer performance on the attentional tasks. Moreover, TS patients with observed tics during testing had greater attentional impairment than those without tics. These results suggest that: (1) many adult TS patients do not have impaired attention; (2) attentional impairment in TS differs from that observed in ADHD; and (3) attentional impairment in TS is associated with the full neurobehavioral spectrum of TS (i.e., tics, OCD, and ADHD).",

Another patient had a left thalamic infarction that resulted in profound proprioceptive sensory loss and chorea on the right side of the body. Two patients had cervical spinal cord disease, proprioceptive sensory loss, and diffuse choreoathetosis. Another patient had dorsal root ganglionitis associ-a Hypothesis Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 277 ated with small-cell lung carcinoma that produced diffuse loss of all sensory modalities and chorea. The last patient had an ulnar sensory neuropathy and choreic movements of the fifth finger. Lesions anywhere along the pathway that transmits limb proprioception may cause pseudochoreoathetosis. Furthermore, choreoathetosis without sensory loss caused by focal lesions of striatum may occur because of disruption of cortical proprioceptive inputs to striatum-perhaps explaining why most focal lesions of striatum do not produce chorea. Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (S-IBM) and autosomalrecessive hereditary inclusion-bod y myositis (H-IBM) are of unknown cause and pathogenesis. In both there are muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles containing 15to 21-nm cytoplasmic tubulofilaments (CTFs) and denervation atrophy; in S-IBM, but not H-IBM, there is a varying degree of inflammation. Vacuolated fibers contain ubiquitinated inclusions (Askanas 1991) and Congo-red positivity indicating amyloid (Mendell 199 1). Because immunoreactive P-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and P-amyloid protein (P-AP) are constituents of ubiquitinated senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, we studied immunolocalization of APP and P-AP fibers in IBM muscle using antibodies against: (1) non-P-AP fragments of APP, viz. (a) C-terminus (residue 676-695 courtesy D. Selkoe) and (b) N-terminus (residue 45-62 courtesy B. Frangione and D. Levartovsky); (2) P-AP (sequence 8-17, courtesy G. Glenner, and sequence 1-40 courtesy D. Selkoe); (3) Ub (Chemicon). In 13 of 13 IBM patients, including one H-IBM, 100% of the vacuolated muscle fibers contained large or several small APP and P-AP immunoreactive (IR) inclusions, which by double-labeling fluorescence were closely colocalized with each other and with Ub-IR. None of 18 control muscle biopsy specimens (including 7 polymyositis) contained APP-IR, P-AP-IR, or Ub-IR inclusions characteristic of IBM. Control experiments utilizing omitted, replaced, or absorbed primary antisera were negative. P-AP, a product of proteolytic cleavage of APP, is receiving attention regarding the pathogenesis of AD. Our study provides (1) the first demonstration of APP and P-AP accumulations in abnormal human muscle, and (2) raises the possibility that in IBM muscle and AD brain rhey may form from similar cellular events.",

Inefficient glutamate transport, and subsequent chronic increase in extracellular glutamate, could be responsible for selective motor neuron death. To test the hypothesis that chronic defects in glutamate uptake can produce motor neuron toxicity, we developed a tissue culture model employing organotypic rat spinal cord maintained under conditions of chronic glutamate uptake inhibition. Slices (300 pM) of lumbar spinal cord from 8-to 14-day-old rat pups were cultured on millicell membranes. Chronic uptake inhibition was produced by culturing tissue in the presence of threohydroxyaspartate (THA) or pyrrolidine-dicarboxylic acid, both known to be specific inhibitors of glutamate transport. THA produced chronic elevation of glutamate in the medium and produced motor neuron toxicity after 25 to 30 days in culture using 100 pM THA, and after 18 days using 500 pM THA, as determined by assay of tissue choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and by histological analysis of 1-micron plastic sections. Motor neuron toxicity was completely blocked by the non-N-methybaspartate (NMDA) antagonists CNQX or NBQX, but not by the NMDA antagonist MK-801. This model demonstrates that the chronic loss of glutamate transport in ALS can produce motor neuron degeneration and that motor neurons appear to be susceptible to non-NMDA-mediated glutamate toxicity.",

To distinguish Chinese paralytic syndrome (CPS) from GBS more clearly, we measured NC in 21 CPS patients (mean 8 yr, range 1.5-35 yr) and in 21 GBS patients from Johns Hopkins (mean 14 yr, range 5-24 yr). Sensory NC was normal in all (n = 62) but 1 nerve of CPS patients, whereas sensory NC was frequently abnormal in GBS patients: median nerve, 63%; ulnar nerve, 87%; and sural nerve, 21%. Motor N C also differed between the groups. In all nerves, distal latency (DL) was significantly longer in GBS than in CPS. For example, in the median nerve, mean DL was 8.6 ms (SE 1) in GBS and 2.8 ms (0.2) in CPS ( p < 0.005).",

The family originates from Nagano prefecture, a mountainous district in the middle part of Japan, and has no relationship to the Finnish population. This family has 42 members in 3 generations, and 14 individuals are affected with slowly progressive cranial neuropathy and corneal lattice dystrophy. The genetic trait is autosomal-dominant. Polarizing microscopy and immunohistochemistry show abundant amyloid deposits reactive to an anti-gelsolin monoclonal antibody. Direct sequence analysis of a DNA fragment spanning codon 187 of the plasmagelsolin cDNA from the propositus, and restriction analysis using a modified PCR from other family members demonstrate a single base substitution, G to A at the first base of codon 187, which is identical to the mutation of Finnish FAP IV.

Previous studies have demonstrated the ultrastructural and metabolic effects of muscle injury. However, the early genomic response to focal injury is presently unknown. We asked whether the immediate early genes (IEGs) or early response genes-~$268, c-jun, nur77, and junB-are responsive to muscle injury. These IEGs encode transcription factors and are expressed rapidly after cell-surface stimulation. We have previously shown that surgical denervation and neural stimulation of muscle induced differential patterns of IEG expression. In this study, we produced injury of mouse gastrocnemius muscle by injection of 20 c1.1 of normal saline. We used the contralateral (uninjected) muscle as a control and examined the mILNA levels of each of these 4 IEGs. We found that ~$ 2 6 8 and junB levels were increased at 1 and 4 hours and returned to basal levels by 24 hours. In contrast, mRNA levels of nur77 and cjun remained unchanged. This pattern of IEG response is distinct from that seen after muscle stimulation or denervation. The selectivity of this pattern suggests that IEG expression may play a role in the response of muscle to injury.",

We hypothesize that MN-enriched or MN-specific genes are important for normal M N function and that their disturbance may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. We have produced clonal hybrid cells derived from embryonic and neonatal spinal cord M N for the study of M N gene properties. Some of these hybrid MN clones express traits typical of MN, such as high levels of choline acetyltransferase enzyme activity and message, glycine receptor message, and neurofilament and neural cell adhesion molecule proteins. We are using molecular techniques to identify novel MN-enriched or MN-specific genes in these cells. With this strategy, we have identified several cDNA clones preferentially expressed in MN hybrid cells but not in the parental neuroblastoma cells by differential hybridization of an embryonic MN hybrid cDNA phage library. We are extending these observations by performing subtraction hybridization experiments. These results suggest that MN-enriched or MN-specific genes can be identified, and may lead to a greater understanding of the etiology of ALS.

Furthermore, human y-interferon induces the surface expression of HLA class I1 on mononuclear myoblasts, but not on multinucleated myotubes. However, whether the cells produce and present the antigen by themselves or take this material from the environment, where it could be released by infiltrative cells, is not yet clear. In this study, we analyzed HLA molecules at the protein level by immunocytochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against different HLA-DR epitopes and HLA-ABC molecules on frozen serial sections of human muscle during development and at the adult stage. Human muscle infiltration by macrophages and monocytesmacrophages also were studied with M718and LeuM3specific monoclonal antibodies at the same stages of development. Our results show that during muscle development and maturation, HLA-DR and HLA-ABC antibodies do not label muscle fibers but some M718-and LeuM3-positive cells within the muscle. These data can be useful to understand the role of infiltrating monocytes-macrophages in the muscle immune response. ",

We carried out a developmental and topographic study of astrocyte expression in the Wobbler mouse model of motoneuron disease. Wobbler mice and normal littermates were studied at 3, 4 , 5 , and 6 weeks of postnatal development. Anesthetized animals were perfused intracardially with paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were dissected and landmarks were identified carefully for systematic study. Sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) neurofilament and neuron-specific enolase. Cell quantitation was done with video-enhancing microscopy. In symptomatic animals, marked increases in GFAP staining were found in rostral and caudal spinal cord areas. Quantitation studies revealed a 15to 20-fold increase in GFAP+ cells in the Wobbler. We conclude that GFAP+ cells are markedly increased in the Wobbler mouse at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar areas. This cell may also be relevant in motoneuron disease pathogenesis.

To evaluate whether the polio virus genome can be detected in the CNS of patients with previous polio infection, we identified 11 patients who had died with autopsy findings and clinical history consistent with poliomyelitis. RNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded sections of brain or spinal cord and subjected to reverse transcription followed by DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers specific for heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and a conserved region of the polio viruses. Hsp70 mRNA could be detected in all specimens, indicating that amplifiable RNA had been isolated. In no specimens could polio virus RNA be detected.

We report a married couple, both of Clue to Etiology? whom developed ALS in 1 year. The couple grew up in southeastern Pennsylvania and attended the same schools. They married after high school and have 2 healthy children. In September 1990, a 38-year-old woman noted right-hand weakness and associated fasciculations that progressed to the entire right upper extremity. By January 1991, the lower extremities were asymmetrically weak and fasciculating. She then developed left-arm weakness, d ysarthria, dysphagia, and emotional incontinence. She had hyperreflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Then, in May 1991, her husband, aged 38, noted difficulty whistling, which progressed to frank dysarthria. Later, he developed dysphagia, emotional incontinence, and weakness, wasting, and fasciculations in the upper extremities. Hyperactive gag, jaw, and limb reflexes were present. In both, electrodiagnostic testing revealed widespread evidence of lower motor neuron degeneration. Numerous laboratory tests were normal. Although these cases may represent a chance association, the development of ALS in a young husband and wife suggests a possible environmental cause. The authors welcome suggestions about these cases from the neurological community. Conduction block in demyelinating neuropathies usually is assessed from differences in the sizes of surface-recorded maximum M-potentials evoked by supramaximal stimulation at successively more proximal sites along the course of motor nerves. As the maximum M-potential is comprised of many bitriphasic surface-recorded motor unit action potentials (MUAPs), differences in the relative latencies between MUAPs may lead to phase cancellations, reducing the M-potential size and rendering any quantitative assessment of the extent of conduction block relative to phase cancellation difficult. Cooling a muscle (not the nerve), however, by as much as 15\u00b0C increases the negative peak durations of MUAPs by as much as 2 to 3 times and moves the point at which maximum phase cancellation might occur to some theoretical point well proximal to the spinal roots. In 5 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) studied to date, cooling produced little change in percent reductions in M-potential negative peak areas between successively more proximal sites of stimulation. This finding suggests that \"true\" conduction block rather than interpotential phase cancellation best explains reductions in M-potential size at successively more proximal sites of stimulation in GBS.",

Botulinum A toxin injections have been proven effective therapy for various dystonic disorders including focal laryngeal dystonia, blepharospasm, and torticollis. Previous SFEMG studies have demonstrated remote effects of the toxin in noninjected muscles after treatment for both blepharospasm and torticollis. These effects include an increase in fiber density, mean jitter (MCD), and percentage of fiber pairs with increased jitter. Other researchers have postulated that the distant effects of this toxin may be related in part to the dose of botulinum toxin injected. To investigate this hypothesis we have studied patients treated for focal laryngeal dystonia because the amounts of toxin required are 1/25th to 1/1OOth of the doses used to treat other dystonias. Using electromyographic (EMG) guidance, bilateral injections of 2.5 or 5.0 mouse units of botulinum A toxin were injected into each vocalis muscle of 11 patients. Each patient had significant improvement in phonotory function within 48 hours after injections and have been followed serially (usually within 3 weeks and again at 2 mo) after injections, with SFEMG recordings of the left extensor digitorum communis and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Five patients have had more than 1 series of injections over the 10 months since we began this study. SFEMG studies have revealed no significant change in the fiber density, mean MCD, or percent of fiber pairs with normal jitter in either muscle. In conclusion, our studies support the hypothesis that the presence of remote effects of botulinum toxin may be related, in part, to the amount of toxin used. ",

Previous work has demonstrated that the axon itself is responsible for the phenotype of prolonged survival. We investigated whether the lack of rapid axonal degeneration after axotomy in this substrain is due to an inability to break down cytoskeletal components, a process that is normally accomplished by activation of intrinsic calcium proteases. Segments of desheathed sciatic nerves from normal and Ola mice were incubated for 2 hours under conditions that disrupt the axolemma (freeze/ thaw or in 1 % triton x-loo), allowing external calcium free access to axoplasm. Nerves were analyzed by Western blot for neurofilament (NF) proteins and by electron microscopy. In high-calcium media (1 mM CaCI,), NF immunoreactivity was lost and axoplasm was reduced to watery debris in both substrains, whereas in EGTA-buffered media, axoplasm was preserved. These results demonstrate that calcium-activated proteases are present and can be activated in Ola nerves. The defect in these mice that allows for prolonged survival of transected axons is likely in the mechanism for calcium entry into the distal stump.

Organelle transport was studied (7 neurites and 100-140 organelles per condition) using computer-enhanced video microscopy. Mean fast anterograde (1.00 k 0.07 pmsec-' vs 1.65 * 0.07 pmsec-') and retrograde (0.67 2 0.04 pmsec-' vs 1.19 +-0.05 pmsec-') transport were decreased in CP-treated compared to control cells ( p < 0.0001). In CP/ACTH4,-treated cells, mean anterograde (1.46 +_ 0.07 pmsec-') and retrograde (1.13 2 0.04 pmsec-') velocities were greater than in CP cells ( p < 0.0001). Velocities in control and CP/ACTH4, cells were not statistically different. Erythrophore pigment granule transport was observed in a blinded study, using similar techniques. Mean aggregation velocity was greater in control (1.99 k 0.09 msec-') and CP/ACTH4, (1.97 f 0.07 msec-')-treated cells compared to CP (1.43 * 0.07 msec-') cells ( p < 0.0001). Incubation with CP for 1 or 72 hours affected velocities equally, but acute exposure was more easily reversed by control or ACTH,, containing media. There is striking inhibition by CP in cross-species models of organelle transport. This can be prevented by ACTH4,. Erythrophores allow future study of individual transport components.",

Potential sequences were modeled using a semi-empirical molecular mechanical force field approach. The sequence rat ~7 5~~~ 367-379 represents a highly conserved amphiphilic domain predicted to be involved in neurotrophin signal transduction via G-protein mechanisms. To test this prediction, peptides containing sequences homologous to p7 5NGFR 367-3 79 were examined for effects on trophic factor-induced survival/differentiation responses of rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, chick embryo DRG neurons, and chick embryo ciliary neurons. A peptide identical to ~7 5~~~ 367-379 accelerated the neurite growth response to nerve growth factor (NGF) of PC12 cells and DRG neurons in a time frame that paralleled uptake into cells, but mastoparan did not influence NGF-mediated neurite growth. Millimolar Mg+ + and benzalkonium chloride, known to block the actions of mastoparan, blocked the effect of the peptide on NGF-mediated neurite growth by PC12 cells. Peptides mutated to alter cationic amino acid relationships or amphiphilicity were less effective than the peptide in accelerating NGF-mediated neurite growth. These observations complement and extend evidence suggesting a pivotal role of ~7 5~~~ in NGF-mediated signal transduction. These studies complement and extend evidence suggesting a pivotal role of p7SNGFR in neurotrophin signal transduction and evidence that activation of intracellular signalling processes involving specific G-protein mechanisms are involved in neurotrophin-mediated neurite growth. Crushing the hypoglossal nerve causes hypoglossal motor neurons to decrease expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and begin expressing p75NGFR, the low-affinity NGF receptor. These changes are evident within 3 days after the injury and continue for several weeks. Inhibition of axonal transport by vincristine applied to uninjured nerves causes loss of ChAT expression without induction of ~7 5~~\" . We sought to determine if topical vincristine would alter p7SNGF' expression after nerve injury. Hypoglossal nerves were surgically exposed unilaterally in anesthetized rats and crushed. One week later, rats were reanesthetized and the same nerves were re-exposed. Vincristine or saline was applied at the crush sites by soaking a strip of cotronoid wrapped around the nerves. One week later, rats were anesthetized and perfused with aldehydes. Frozen sections from the brainstems were stained by indirect immunoperoxidase to demonstrate ChAT and ~7 5~~~' .",

We tried to determine whether oligodendrocytes (OL) from adult 6-month-old rat brain are similarly susceptible. Toxicity to OL was examined using light microscopy and galactocerebroside immunohistochemistry where the relative number of surviving OL and their extent of process formation were graded. Five days of exposure to norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) at 10 and 100 FM produced significant toxicity ( p < 0.05, analysis of variance [ANOVA)) to adult rat OL; this toxicity was evident by 24 hours of exposure. Treatment with catalase (50 p,g/ml), a free-radical scavenger enzyme, completely prevented the toxicity of catecholamines. To ascertain whether astrocytes, which have free-radical scavenging capacity, could prevent the catecholamine-induced injury to OL, rat OL were seeded on neonatal rat astrocytes. Under such conditions, the toxicity of N E and EPI was reduced significantly ( p < 0.05, ANOVA). These findings suggest that impairment of this protective function of astrocytes may render OL and its myelin membrane susceptible to free-radical-mediated damage. Lyme neuroborreliosis is an increasingly prevalent disorder, but the diagnosis generally has been indirect. Thus, the pres-ence of other manifestations of the infection, consistent findings on neurological exam or lumbar puncture, or presence of CSF antibody have been used rather than direct isolation or identification of the organism from the CSF. We have previously developed polymerase chain reaction with hybridization (PCR/H) to identify Borrelia burgdorferi in the blood and organs of infected mice, and found that the assay was equivalent or, in some cases, preferable to culture (Ann Neurol 1991; 30:302) . The assay used for primers oligos derived from a sequence of genomic B. burgdovfri D N A expressed on a plasmid by Rosa and Schwan. A two-stage nested PCR was performed on CSF samples in which the D N A was isolated in a variety of ways. PCR products were subsequently hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled internal probe by slotblot hybridization. The sensitivity of the assay was excellent, being <O. 1 fg of purified B. burgdoorfevi DNAiml of CSF, and 1 to 10 spirochetes per ml of CSF when \"spiked\" CSF was tested. The assay then was applied to a battery of CSFs stored over the past 15 years in patients with definite, probable, and possible Lyme neuroborreliosis. The lack of PCR/H positivity in some patients with definite and probable disease signifies that the spirochete does not reside in the lumbar CSF in all patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, and may be concentrated in the meninges or parenchyma.",

Sequence analysis indicates that the clones appear to have 2 alternatively spliced forms and have extensive homology with human serum re-sponse factor (SRF) and a family of related transcription factors that has representatives throughout eukaryotic evolution in species from yeast to man. SRF is thought to have a role in regulation of immediate early genes and of muscle-specific genes. In gel mobility-shift assays, the SRF-like proteins coded for by our clones bind specifically to the myocytespecific enhancer binding factor-2 (MEF-2) regulatory element, a DNA sequence that has so far been found to be functionally important in the promoter and enhancer regions of a variety of muscle-specific genes. Moreover, our SRF-like proteins specifically activate transcription of reporter genes containing the MEF-2 element.

However, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has another pathological hallmark, which is the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles. The question is, therefore, to clarify the possible relationship between altered APP metabolism and neurofibrillary degeneration. One classic method for inducing neurofibrillary tangles is the administration of aluminum salts. Although these tangles are morphologically different than those seen in AD brain, this phenomenon has given rise to the hypothesis that aluminum might be an environmental factor in the causation of AD. This theory is controversial, but the animal aluminum model remains one of the few ways that long-lasting neuroskeletal changes can be induced. To explore the effects of aluminum salts on APP metabolism, we examined APP immunodistribution in rat brain injected intraventricularly or intrastriatally with AICI,. We found a long-lasting accumulation of APP in affected neurites, as well as in activated microglia/macrophages. Abnormal neurites also showed argentophilic changes, neurofilament accumulation, and Alz-50 immunoreactivity. The results support the hypothesis that interruption of axoplasmic flow by aluminum salts, as by other means, can lead to both APP accumulation and neuroskeletal alterations.",

To investigate the mechanism of the rapid improvement of nerve conduction, the influence of Na channel blockade on nerve conduction was studied. In 4 healthy volunteers, the recovery of the CMAP and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of median nerve stimulation were recorded after the intravenous infusion of 100 mg of lidocaine. After the loading, CMAP and SNAP were reduced rapidly in amplitude and were slowed in latency. After the recovery of amplitude of CMAP and SNAP, the nerve conduction velocities were improved gradually in 2 hours with the amplitudes and configurations of CMAP and SNAP unchanged. This indicated that myelinated nerve conduction velocity could be slowed by the inactivation of Na channels without demyelination or conduction block. The prolongation of rising time in depolarization of axonal membrane potential should be one of the mechanisms of this conduction slowing due to inactivation of Na channels. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) in gynecological and breast cancers frequently is accompanied by an autoantibody response (Type I or \"anti-Yo\") reacting with 34and 62-kd cytoplasmic antigens of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Sakai et al, using a cerebellar library (Stratagene), recently have isolated a cDNA clone expressing a 52-kd protein recognized by IgG from a patient with PCD and uterine carcinoma (Sakai et al, Ann Neurol 1990; 28:692) . This clone is believed to share some homology with the message encoding the 62-kd protein recognized by Type I sera. Because PCD17 was isolated using serum from a single patient, however, it is not known whether the expressed protein of PCD17 is recognized uniformly by all patients with Type I antibody response. E. coli strain XL1-Blue transformed with pWR590-2 containing the SnaBIIHindIII fragment of PCD17, pWRSBO-PCDl?SN, was induced using isopropylthiogalactoside. Bacterial lysates were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western immunoblot Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 285 methods using sera and CSF from patients with PCD associated with gynecological and breast malignancies who exhibited Type I antibody response. The 52-kd expression product was labeled by 818 sera and 414 CSF samples tested from antibody-positive patients but was not labeled by sera or CSFs from controls. Our studies demonstrate that the 52-kd protein expressed by PCD17 contains epitopes that are consistently recognized by both systemically and intrathecally produced antibodies from patients with PCD accompanying gynecological and breast malignancies. Tax01 is a novel antitumor drug that has demonstrated impressive clinical activity in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. Although sensory neuropath y has been described secondary to both taxol alone and taxol-cisplatin combination, detailed neurophysiological and pathological studies have not been described. Nineteen patients with solid tumors were treated with combinations of taxol (135-350 mg/m2), cisplatin (75-100 mg/m2), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 pglkglday). Sequential neurological examinations, nerve conduction studies (NCS), and quantitative vibration testing (QST) were performed during and after treatment. Eighteen of 19 patients developed sensorimotor neuropathy and 3 developed myopathy. Thirteen were symptomatic with numbness or weakness and 17 had abnormal results on neuromuscular examination. NCS showed absent or prolonged H-reflexes (14), reduced peroneal motor amplitude (14), reduced sural sensory amplitude (13), and myopathic motor unit potentials in proximal muscles (3). QST results were abnormal in 7 of 15 tested patients. Muscle biopsy specimen in a patient with myopathy showed features of a toxic myopathy. The neuropathy was worse with higher cumulative dosages of taxol (>600 mg), with higher single doses of taxol(>300 mg/m2), or with a preexisting neuropathy. We conclude that sensorimotor neuropathy and myopathy are dose-limiting neurotoxicities of combined cisplatin and taxol use, now that neutropenia can be controlled with Neuropathy and Myopathy G-CSF.

Definite LM involvement was identified with a positive CSF cytology, lymphomatous LM infiltration on a surgical specimen, or MRI with gadolinium showing LM tumor. Probable LM lymphoma was diagnosed in pts with suspicious or atypical CSF cytology. There were 41 women and 42 men with a median age of 57 (range 20-81 yr). At diagnosis, mean white blood cell count was 49/mm3 (range 0-5,5 10); mean lumbar CSF protein was 103 mgldl (range 3-1,893); and mean ventricular CSF protein was 32 mgldl (range 4-265). Glucose was always normal. Nineteen of 57 pts sampled had oligoclonal bands, and 42/65 had elevated pz microglobulin. At diagnosis 43 (52%) had an abnormal CSF cytology: 22 positive, 16 suspicious, and 5 atypical. One pt had pathological infiltration of the LM and 1 had LM tumor on spine MRI for a total of 45 (54%) pts with definite or probable LM lymphoma. In 43 pts with abnormal cytology, the abnormality was found in 30143 (70%) LPs and 32/55 (58%) of the Ommaya and ventricular specimens. In 8 pts the lumbar cytology was the only abnormal specimen despite multiple ventricular samples, and in 10 only the ventricular CSF was abnormal. Thirty-six of 83 (43%) pts developed recurrent tumor afrer treatment. Forty-two percent (15136) of all patients with relapse had LM recurrence. LM recurrence was accompanied by brain recurrence in 9 pts, systemic in 1, ocular in 1, both systemic and ocular in 1, and isolated in 3. At diagnosis 59/83 patients received treatment directed against the LM. Of these, 8 (14%) had meningeal recurrence whereas 7 of the 24 (29%) patients who did not receive this treatment had LM recurrence.

Sixty-three solid cancer patients with a single brain metastasis were prospectively randomized for neurosurgery and radiotherapy combined (Arm 1) or radiotherapy alone (Arm 2). They were stratified for lung or nonlung cancer and for active versus stable or absent extracranial disease. World Health Organization performance status was 9. Age, sex, performance status, and location of brain metastasis were divided evenly over both groups. One-month mortality was 7% in Arm 1 and 6% in Arm 2. Median survival of 11 months after Combination therapy was significantly better compared to 6 months after irradiation alone ( p < .04). It made no difference whether they had lung or nonlung cancer. The largest difference between both treatment arms was observed in patients with stable or absent extracranial disease (12 vs 7 mo, p < .02). When systemic disease activity was present, median survival was 5 months irrespective of treatment arm. Functional independent survival was 1 to 2 months shorter than overall survival and was significantly better for patients with stable extracranial disease after combined therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that age was also an independent prognostic factor. Patients older than 60 years had a hazard ratio for dying of 2.8 (p. 004). We will detail the type and pattern of neurological complications in T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and review how they differ from those associated with B-cell NHL, and the lymphomas in general. This study is the first step in a process to characterize these tumors to determine if special staging or CNS prophylaxis are indicated in any of the subtypes of T-cell lymphoma.",

Three women stabilized or had slight improve-Associated with Breast Cancer ment with cancer treatment, and 2 continue to gradually progress while in cancer remission; 1 required a cane to ambulate after 9 years due to sensory ataxia. One who developed cancer relapse had concurrent neurological relapse. One woman treated with high-dose immunoglobulin did not improve. None had significant weight loss. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (28-60) in 3, antinuclear antibody 1:40 in 1, CSF with lymphocytic pleocytosis (7-14 white blood cellslmm) in 3/ 4 and elevated protein (5 1-97 mg/dl) in 414 available. EMGI NCV showed mild sensory-to-motor polyneuropathy in 314 available. None had detectable antibodies against peripheral nerve or dorsal root ganglia. The etiology of sensorimotor neuropathy in these patients is unknown, but it may represent a distinct paraneoplastic syndrome that can herald the onset of, and parallel the course of breast cancer.

Cerarnide did not decrease cell viability by trypan blue. Ceramide inhibits proliferation and induces process formation in a glioma cell line, causing it to assume a more differentiated phenotype. Cerarnide or its analogs represent possible future therapeutic agents that would inhibit the growth and affect differentiation of anaplastic gliomas. [Bashir, Mod Pathol 1990; 3(4) :429-434)). This is similar to the pattern seen in EBV-infected human B cells and unlike the uniform latent infection seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. We tested the hypothesis that long-term passaging of EBV-immortalized human B cells in immunodeficient mice leads to emergence of a uniform nonlytic pattern of EBV infection associated with appearance of the malignant profile. EBV-infected normal human B cells were serially passaged intracerebrally in severe combined immunodeficient CB17 mice (5 x 10' cells per mouse, 5 mice per passage for a total of 10 passages). Frozen mouse brain sections from each passage were stained with VCA antibody (EBV lytic cycle) and hybridized with biotinylated BamH1-W sequence of EBV. All injected animals developed tumors as previously described (Bashir, Lab Invest 1991; 65(6):702-709) . Tumor cells continued to express VCA and showed latent and lytic hybridization patterns with BamH,-W after 10 passages despite exhibiting monoclonality (surface immunoglobulins) and random chromosomal changes. Lytic infection of immortalized B cells with EBV is stable, resembling brain lymphomas in AIDS, and unlike the latent infection seen in Burkitt's lymphoma.",

DeGennam, Worcester, MA Inducing cancers to differentiate into more benign differentiated tumors represents a novel oncological strategy. To establish a model that would permit assessment of this phenomenon at a molecular level, we created and have partially characterized a murine neuroblastoma line that has been stably transfected with a synthetic fusion gene containing the promoter element of the rodent synapsin I gene (synapsin I regulatory element ISRE)). In vivo, this promoter directs the neuron-specific expression of the synapsin I gene in normal adults. The gene also is expressed in varying amounts in neuronal tumors including neuroblastoma. In the synthetic fusion gene, the SRE has been linked to the lacZ gene that encodes bacterial P-galactosidase. A simple histochemical assay for p-galactosidase therefore provides a specific marker of the expression of the fusion gene. Our preliminary experiments as of this writing have shown that it is possible to detect p-galactosidase activity in the transfected neuroblastoma cells both in vitro and in transplanted tumors. It appears possible therefore that this transfected neuroblastoma cell line can provide a useful model system with which to assess the effects of differentiation therapies. larger lesions (>18 cm2), and larger midline shifts (>4 mm). Twenty-eight of 36 (78%) patients with prior HAS had BT HAS compared to 25 of 75 (33%) patients without prior HAS. In 8 patients, their BT H A was similar to their previous HA but was more frequent or severe. We conclude that HAS in BT patients are common but usually not severe. Nausea, vomiting, an abnormal neurological examination, or a change in prior headaches warrant further investigation. Cairncross and Macdonald showed that procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) are effective for recurrent anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO) (Ann Neurol 1988; 23:360-364) . PCV now has a major role in management of all forms of oligodendrogliomas (0), but the biological basis for this response is unknown. To evaluate one subset of possibilities, we studied 14 patients (6 AO, 8 0) with a CT method that permits measurement of blood-to-tissue transport (KJ, tumor-to-blood transport (K2), and vascular volume (V,) (Ann Neurol 1991; 30:581-587) . PCV was used to treat 11 of the 14 patients. K, (~1 grr-' min-') values were highly variable for whole tumor, ranging from 1.49 to 14.37 (mean 4.87 k 4.17) with no difference between A 0 and 0. K2 and V, were also highly variable. K, of tumor-free brain was 1.40 to 2.69 (mean 1.89 ? 0.50). In comparison to malignant astrocytomas, which have a mean K, in the range of 21.0 with some as high as 33.9, A 0 and 0 appear to be much less permeable. This suggests that the efficacy of PCV may be due to factors other than capillary transport, such as tumor-cell sensitivity.",

A frameless stereotactic neurosurgical localizing system was designed that overcomes these liabilities. This armless, frameless, stereotactic pointing device provides real-time three-dimensional localization information during operation. In addition to assisting in placement of a trephine craniotomy, it allows volumetric resection of the tumor with virtually complete excision of even large irregularly shaped tumors. Mean error on localizing a point in space using this system has proven to be less than 2 mm. A technical description of the system as well as surgical results are presented.

We observed marked reproducible neurological improvement after plasmapheresis in a 43-year-old woman with IML. Presenting with a cauda equina syndrome, she progressed over 1 year with neurological, hepatic, and hematological disease. Persistent laboratory abnormalities included a high sedimentation rate (140 mm/hr), coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Extensive evaluations for infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic processes, including bone marrow examination, were inconclusive. Because of neurological progression, empiric therapy with high-dose steroids followed by cyclophosphamide was initiated without response. Plasmapheresis (250 ml/kg in 6 exchanges) effected resolution of encephalopathy and normalization of the coagulopathy and sedimentation rate. Neurological progression recurred within 2 weeks of pheresis; 6 repetitive courses reproduced neurological response. Finally, progressive dementia ensued, and a decision was made to cease pheresis; the patient died 5 days later, 16 months after presentation. Autopsy disclosed diffuse intravascular CD-20 positive malignant lymphoma cells in small vessels of all organs.

More recently, studies from our laboratory revealed synergy between two brainstem structures, the PAG and the LC. In the current study, we explored the analgesic interactions between the PAG and the NRM using indwelling cannulae. First, we established morphine dose-response curves and calculated the ED,, independently in the PAG (1.9 pg) and the NRM (2.5 pg). We then simultaneously injected various morphine doses into both regions. Injecting morphine at 1 pg into either the PAG or the NRM did not elevate tailflick latencies above baseline values. However, administered into both regions simultaneously, the 2 1-pg doses produced an 80% maximal response, corresponding to more than a threefold increase of baseline latencies. A fixed morphine dose of 1 pg in the PAG shifted the morphine dose-response curve fivefold in the NRM (ED,, 0.5 pg), whereas a fixed NRM dose of 1 Fg shifted morphine's dose-response in the PAG approximately twofold. Together, these results clearly show synergistic interactions for morphine between the PAG and the NRM. The presence of synergistic interactions between brainstem nuclei as well as between the brainstem and the spinal cord underscores the complexity of opioid analgesic systems.",

Siloerstein, Ann Arbor, M I Important evidence of the neurotoxicity of endogenous glutamate (GLU) in mammalian brain was provided by the observation that DL-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, a high-affinity glutamate uptake (HAGU) inhibitor, was neurotoxic in adult rodent striatum (J Neurochem 1985; 44:247) ; however, the absence of neurotoxicity in neonatal brain was interpreted as evidence that immaturity of glutamatergic innervation limited the potential role of endogenous GLU as a neurotoxin in the immature brain. Yet, considerable data provide indirect support for the hypothesis that GLU can be neurotoxic at this stage. To resolve this issue, we assessed the neurotoxicity of a novel, selective HAGU inhibitor, ~-trans-2,4-pyrrolidine dicarboxylate (L-PDC) (J Med Chem 1991;34:717), in postnatal day (PND) 7 rats (n = 8). L-PDC (pH 7.4) was stereotaxically injected into right anterior striatum (STR) (568 nrnol, n = 2) or through dorsal hippocampus into posterior STR (568 nmol, n = 4; 150 nmol, n = 2). Animals were killed 5 days later, and neuropathology was assessed in cresyl violet-stained sections. After anterior injections, focal neuronal necrosis was evident in dorsal STR; high-dose posterior injections caused prominent hippocampal lesions with pyramidal layer thinning and focal necrosis in dorsal thalamus, while 150 nmol produced small foci of pyramidal cell loss. In both groups, focal cortical necrosis and callosal cysts were apparent adjacent to the injection track. L-PDC-induced brain injury provides direct support for the hypothesis that endogenous GLU may be neurotoxic in the developing brain. (Sax et al, Ann Neurol 1991; 30:311A) . The signs and symptoms of 7 of these patients lessened for 12 to 22 months. Furthermore, a patient with a severe oral-lingual biting dyskinesia improved when taking doses up to 300 milligrams per day for 4 months. We noted no-significant adverse reactions, although 4 patients had mild but labile elevations in SGOP and SGPT. One patient receiving opioid analgesics for pain inadvertently failed to discontinue the naltrexone but noted no reduction in the pain-alleviating effects of the analgesic. Although hyperkinesia, especially of midline functions, as well as quality of life improved for the HD patients, their cognitive deficits remained unaffected. These observations suggest that chronic naltrexone is a safe and effective agent to treat chorea, dysphagia, and oral dyskinesia in HD for periods longer than a year. Furthermore, they indicate that naltrexone can be effective in ameliorating oral-lingual biting tardive dyskinesia. These findings support our previous hypothesis that endogenous opioids play a role in rhe modulation of the dopamine system in hyperkinetic stereotypic movement disorders. A. Jon Stoessl, Elizabeth Szczutkmuski, and Hanna Fydvszak, London, Ontario, Canada We previously have demonstrated (Psychopharmacology 1989; 98:372-379 ) that intraperitoneally (IP) administered cholecystokinin (CCK)-8s suppresses vacuous chewing mouth movements (VCMs, a putative mode1 of tardive dyskinesia) in rats exposed to chronic neuroleptics. As CCK is not thought to cross the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts, its site of action in this paradigm is unclear. Other behavioral and neurochemical effects of IP CCK are blocked by vagotomy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered fluphenazine decanoate (FLU; 25 mg/kg IM) or its vehicle every 3 weeks for approximately 20 weeks. CCK (10, 20, or 50 ng intracerebroventricularly) had no effect on neuroleptic-induced VCMs. Another group of neuroleptic-treated rats was subjected to bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or a sham procedure. CCK-8s (10, 30, or 50 pg/kg intraperitoneally) suppressed neuroleptic-induced VCMs in shamoperated animals, which confirmed our previous results. In vagotomited animals, chronic FLU failed to induce VCMs and CCK was without effect in vehicle-or neuroleptictreated animals. These data suggest that the effects of CCK on FLU-induced VCMs may be mediated peripherally, and that vagal pathways may be important for generating this response.

Excitotoxic Amino Acids Are Not Involved in Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity of M P T P Eldad Mehmed, Jutta Rosenthal, and Avinoam Reches, Petah Tiqva, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem, Israel The dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is mediated via its oxidation in CNS to MPP + , which enters DA neurons and poisons mitochondrial complex I. DA neuronal damage induced by direct nigral MPP+ injection is prevented by pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, which suggests that excitatory amino acids are involved in MPTP toxicity. Since local MPP + application may produce nonselective nigral damage, we examined whether excitotoxins have a role in toxicity of systemically administered MPTP. C57 black mice were injected intraperitoneally, once, with MPTP.HCI(40 mg/kg) and decapitated 5 days later. Groups of animals underwent the following pretreatments: (I) decortication 1 week prior to MFTP; (2) intracerebroventricular injections of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists 2-amino-phosphonoheptanoate and D-glutamyl-glycine; and (3) intraperitoneal injections of the calcium channel antagonists nimodipine, diltiazem, and flunarizine 30 minutes prior to MPTP. MPTP produced marked striatal DA depletions. Decortication, destroying glutamatergic corticostriatal projections, intracerebral amino acid receptor antagonists, and systemic calcium channel antagonists did not protect mice against MPTP toxicity; MPTP-induced striatal DA decreases were similar to those given the neurotoxin alone. This study suggests that excitotoxins are not involved in the mechanism of MPTP toxicity.",

Loring, Augusta, GA A unique neurophysiological role for thiamine in cholinergic systems has been suggested. Total thiamine content in cholinergic nerve terminals is comparable to that of acetylcholine, and the phosphorylation state of thiamine changes with release of acetylcholine. Thiamine binds to nicotinic receptors and may exhibit anticholinesterase activity. Based on these observations, we investigated the effects of pharmacological doses of thiamine on the cognitive deficits induced by the anticholinergic scopolamine in 13 healthy young adults using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-conrrolled, double crossover design. Cognitive tests included the P3 eventrelated potential and free recall memory for a verbal paragraph.

Subsequent analysis revealed that in 14 of the 17 patients CFF improvements and reversals followed in a phase-locked trend the rising and falling serum concentrations of EL-970, including 3 patients whose changes remained below the 15% increase needed to qualify for the improved category. These results resemble the phase-locked effects of temperature on neurological function in MS. The CFF changes, because they so closely reflect variations in serum concentration, suggest that EL-970 tissue levels closely follow those in serum and that EL-970 rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Efficacy of EL-970 in MS is also predicted to have a close relationship to serum levels.",

Pettegrnu, Pittsburgh, PA Comparison of quantitative results from different analytical techniques can prove difficult due to the peculiarities of the particular techniques and the lack of a common standard applicable to all of the techniques. Recently, both in vivo and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have been applied to the quantification of a large variety of metabolites. Although NMR can be applied to the study of living tissue, the question arises of how this technique compares with more traditional techniques such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Although this question can be addressed partly by studying perchloric acid (PCA) extracts, it is difficult to directly compare this in vitro NMR data with results from HPLC. To address this question, we have developed an internal standard that can be quantified directly by in vitro phosphorus-3 1 NMR, proton NMR, and by 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC) derivatization followed by separation by HPLC. A variety of aminophosphonic acids were studied by 3'P NMR, 'H NMR, and HPLC. Promising compounds were added to PCA extracts of human brain. The optimal compound was found to be 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (APP, HO3P-CH2-CH,-CH2-NH2). APP is easily detectable by all 3 techniques, falls well outside of the region of interest in phosphorus-31 NMR, and is well resolved by proton NMR at 500 MHz. It is easily separable from the phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters observable by HPLC and from the amino acids that occur in brain in significant concentrations. APP appears to be a useful internal standard in the study of phosphorus and amino acid metabolites by in vitro 31P NMR, 'H NMR, and HPLC. Theories of sentence comprehension hypothesize at least a grammatical component that establishes the relationship among words in a sentence, and a semantic component that determines the meanings of these words. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 12 neurologically intact subjects during their detection of a letter target, a grammatical target, or a semantic target in the same written sentences. A mixedmodel analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant main effects for region (F E30, 210) = 19.32; p < .001), condition (F 12, 143 = 3 . 9 6 ;~ < .05), and a significant region times condition interaction ( F {GO, 4203 = 1.46; p < .05), but there were no differences between individual subjects. Subsequent ANOVAs revealed increased rCBF in a unique set of brain regions during the subjects' response to a grammatical probe when compared to their response to a letter probe of the same sentences. A unique distribution of rCBF also distinguished response to the semantic probe from response to the grammatical probe and the letter probe. Other brain regions apparently contributed to performance for several activation conditions. These findings support the hypothesized dissociation of specific linguistic components based on their unique cerebral topographical representation, and that a distributed network of brain regions subserves sentence comprehension.",

Fast-Fourier transform ( F R ) of electrocortical activity was carried out during task performance and the eyes-open resting state. Data were analyzed using a computer-assisted model. Increases in regional beta activity of greater than 3 standard deviations from the resting state were considered significant of activation. During audition, the musicians showed activation in the right posterior parietotemporal region; the naive showed no change from the resting state. During silent singing, the musicians showed bitemporal activation, R > L; the naive showed activation in the right mid-and posteriortemporal regions alone. During silent sight reading, the musicians showed a major activation in both temporal regions, L > > R, the naive showed only a marginal change in the posterior temporal-occipital regions. These data suggest that music processing is primarily a right cerebral function in untrained individuals and a bilateral function in musicians.

Ictal plasmdcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed increased BZ-like activity (Ann Neurol, in press). Recently, an endogenous BZreceptor ligand (endozepine [EZ]) has been purified from mammalian brain with properties similar to diazepam. It acts like diazepam to potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acidmediated postsynaptic inhibition. We hypothesized that IRS might be due to an excess of this substance. IRS was diagnosed in 2 patients, 41 and 58 years old, who had recurring stupor or coma episodes lasting hours to days. Ictal brain CT/MRI, kidney, liver, heart, blood glucose, ammonia, and osmolality were normal. EEG showed fast 13-Hz background activity while the patients were unreactive to stimuli, reversed by flumazenil.

We investigated the ability of 20 nondemented PD patients with mild motor impairments to learn about the grammatical and semantic information represented in a new verb. The new verb was presented to patients in a sentence-picture matching context, and we probed their recall of the verb 10 minutes later. A sentence judgment task assessed grammatical knowledge by asking patients to judge the new verb, known verbs, and pseudowords used appropriately or incorrectly in a sentence.

PD patients were as accurate as controls at deciding whether a picture illustrated the meaning of the new verb (F (1, 331 = 0.lO;p > 0.10). Only 1 PD patient (5%) had difficulty sorting pictures. Selective difficulty recalling only grammatical aspects of a new word suggests that the word learning impairment in PD cannot be entirely explained by poor memory. Instead, in agreement with other recent findings, PD patients may be impaired in some aspect of grammatical processing in language. We discuss the hypothesis that defects in the frontocaudate axis in PD underlie this impairment. Neuropsychological performance on both verbal and nonverbal tasks is reported to differ between healthy men and women. Some of these cognitive differences are postulated to reflect differences in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric cerebral organization. Our preliminary study indicated that women with Alzheimer's disease (AD) performed worse than men on a composite neuropsychological battery, even after effects of potentially confounding variables were considered (Buckwalter et al, J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 1992; 14:23) . To explore further the nature of gender-associated differences in AD, we analyzed data from a verbal and a nonverbal task (the Boston Naming Test and drawings from the Spatial Quantitative Battery supplement to the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination) for 22 men and 23 women who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for \"probable\" AD.

An apparent response to the placebo was seen in 3 patients. Improvement after IVIg therapy was maintained for variable durations (3-20 wk) and reoccurred with subsequent infusions. An equally effective response was documented after infusion of a single IVIg dose of 1 gm/kg. We conclude that IVIg therapy is effective in some patients with CIDP, even after long duration of illness. The best responses were observed in patients with recent relapse. A single high-dose treatment may be equally effective.

Neurological syndromes included confusion with acute flulike illness, optic neuritis, hemiparesis with inflammatory brain lesion, encephalitis, headache with erythema migrans, bilateral facial nerve palsies, and encephalomyeloradiculitis. Three patients had CSF abnormalities. In 4 patients CSF parameters were otherwise completely normal. Possible explanations for undetectable CSF Lyme antibodies included early infection (3 patients), prior antibiotics (2 patients), and prior steroids plus antibiotics (1 patient). In 1 patient there was no obvious explanation. We conclude that Osp A, a specific antigen of B. burgdorferi, may be present in CSF without a detectable humoral response. The diagnosis of neurological infection with B. bwgdorjeri should not require a positive CSF serology.",

The episodes conformed to criteria for Mollaret's meningitis as published by Bruyn, Straathof, and Raymakers, and subsequently by others; they lasted about 1 week, and were characterized by fever, headache, meningismus, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spontaneous resolution without residua. Extensive prior evaluations had failed to uncover a cause. The patient was otherwise well and neither he nor his wife had any history of sexually transmitted diseases. Suspicion of herpes simplex virus (HSV) arose due to a single transient, raised skin rash several weeks earlier that failed to yield virus on culture. The patient was treated with acyclovir, which resulted in rapid resolution of symptoms. Though culture and immunological studies of CSF and blood again were unrevealing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of CSF confirmed the presence of HSV type 2. We suspect that herpes simplex virus is a more common cause of recurrent aseptic meningitis than current culture and immunological techniques would suggest. PCR offers increased diagnostic sensitivity for neurotropic viruses and should be considered in patients with recurrent meningitis of cryptic etiology.",

Goldstein, Baltimore, M D Microvascular endothelial function in developing brain is altered by inorganic lead. This may result from changes in protein kinase C (PKC) modulation. We examined the effects of inorganic lead on an in vitro model of neural endothelial differentiation. Astroglial-induced endothelial differentiation into capillary-like structures was inhibited by lead acetate with 50% maximal inhibition occurring at 0.5 pM lead. Inhibition was independent of effects on cell viability or growth. We examined the effects of lead on cellular PKC pools under conditions that inhibited capillary-like structure formation. Membranous PKC increased in C6 astroglial and neural endothelial cells after exposure to lead acetate. Exposing C6 cells to 5 p,M lead for 16 hours increased membranous PKC by 150% as determined by immunoblotting. Membranous PKC increased in response to as little as 50 nM lead and saturated at 1 pM. Phorbol esters were used to determine if PKC modulation was mechanistically related to lead's inhibition of capillary-like structure formation. 12-Myristate 13-acetate (10 nM) inhibited endothelial differentiation by 65 * 5%, whereas 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13didecanoate was without effect. These findings demonstrate that inorganic lead may induce cerebral microvessel dysfunction by interfering with PKC modulation in microvascular endothelial or perivascular astroglial cells.",

Desai, London, Ontario, Canada Gait difficulties in multiple sclerosis (MS) are commonly accompanied by fatigue and dyspnea. Possible explanations for the latter include weakness andlor dyssynergia of the respiratory muscles, including possible abnormalities in central pathways regulating respiration. This study examined central and peripheral motor conduction to the diaphragm in 15 MS patients whose gait was notably labored and accompanied by breathlessness. Peripheral conduction was assessed by measuring the latency and size of the surface-recorded diaphragmatic maximum M-potential responses to supramaximal stimulation of the phrenic nerve in the neck, and central motor conduction by comparable measurements in response to magnetoelectrical stimulation over the vertex. Peripheral motor conduction was normal. The most striking abnormalities were in central motor conduction. Cortical stimulus-evoked diaphragmatic responses were absent on both sides in 3 patients, and unilaterally in l patient, whereas in 5 others the latency of the cortical stimulus-evoked response was increased and the size clearly reduced and entirely normal in only 3 patients. These studies show that central conduction Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 295 to the diaphragm is commonly abnormal and may play a role in the fatigue and dyspnea experienced by MS patients. Six men (40-53 yr) developed myelopathy that progressed slowly over several months and was characterized by asymmetrical, incomplete spinal cord syndrome manifested at the sensory level at the trunk, mild spastic paraparesis, and urinary incontinence. The spinal cord lesions at appropriate levels were recognized by MRI as enhancing lesions in 4 of the men. Coxiella burnetii infection was confirmed in the blood of all patients by immunofluorescence microscopic assay (IFA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 2 patients, we detected C. burnetti by TEM and IFA using CSF of the patients inoculated onto fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes. Four patients who were treated with appropriate antibiotics responded with either partial resolution of symptoms or arrest of further neurological progression. In 3 patients the lesion was shown on MRI to have decreased in size. In summary, we report 6 cases of transverse myelopathy associated with C. barnetti infection. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of Coxiella-related chronic myelopathy.",

No enhancement was noted in a series of 20 controls with no symptoms of hearing loss and vertigo. Enhancement in the brain correlates with inflammatory or neoplastic conditions. We thus can speculate that enhancement of the endolymphatic sac reflects an inflammatory process in this location that may interfere with the normal resorption of indulin and secondary hydrops.

Rates were calculated at 0to 6-and 7to 12-month intervals. ALS deterioration in arms or legs correlated excellently within each interval across transformation and across structure ( r = 0.62026-0.9805; p 5 0.001). Across time there was no significant difference in arms or legs within each transformation ( p = 0.089-0.613). However, correlation of rates of deterioration in individuals across time was poor ( r = 0.0003-0.0366; p = 0.098-0.905), suggesting that there may be difficulty with predicting simply the course of ALS deterioration in individuals using the current statistical models. Although the course in individuals is dramatically presented by SAFnle, its usefulness in controIled trials may be limited by the large population standard deviation of ALS patients compared with the 3 other data transformations(MZ,,,  MZ,,,,  SA,).

Schwann cell lines, expressing large amounts of T antigen when co-cultured with dorsal root ganglia, recognized and segregated neurites but failed to form myelin, whereas cell lines expressing lower amounts of T antigen myelinated the neurites. Investigation of this observation showed that there was an inverse relationship between the amounts of T antigen and of Po proteins. When the plasmid Po promoter ligated to the reporter gene and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used in transient transfection assays, the combination of T antigen and the protooncogene c-jun downregulated CAT expression. In Schwann cells, T antigen also induces the expression of c-jun -A, and the two proteins T antigen and c-jun formed an immunoprecipitable complex. Using HeLa cell extracts in an in vitro transcription assay followed by primer extensions analysis, the combination of T antigen and c+un downregulated transcription from the Po promoter. Furthermore, DNA binding analysis lead to the identification of the sequence on the Po promoter that bound purified T antigen. Antisense experiments and inactivation of the Po gene by homologous recombinations by other investigators have shown that failure to express Po protein leads to the failure of myelin formation. Thus, we believe that T antigenlc-jun complex by downregulating Po expression causes the lack of myelin formation in the peripheral nervous system.

On day 0, 2 x lo5 cells were placed into T-25 culture flasks containing MEM + 15% fetal calf serum and ATRA in concentrations ranging from to M or control media. Cell counting showed growth inhibition by day 4 for all ATRA concentrations. Changes in production or binding of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-(3) are possible mechanisms for ATRA's effects. Monoclonal antibody demonstrated TGF-P cell surface reactivity, before and after ATRA, which indicates that these cells were capable of binding TGF-(3. We are currently studying the effects of ATRA on expression of specific TGF-(3-binding proteins. Untreated D-283 cells expressed the neuronal nuclear marker Hu.

This unusual, nonfamilial case suggests the need for better characterization of late-life mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. A 54-year-old woman became severely demented, palilalic, and aphasic over 6 years. Myoclonus developed in the third year at age 56, upper limb apraxia in the fourth, gait apraxia, rigidity, optic ataxia, and ptosis in the fifth. Primitive reflexes were prominent. Lactic acidosis (4.1 mEq/L) and high urinary levels of lactate and Krebs cycle intermediates were detected. Muscle biopsy specimens revealed myopathic changes with type I1 fiber atrophy and increased numbers of very small mitochondria, while activities of mitochondrial enzymes, cytochrorne oxidase, and NADH dehydrogenase were significantly depressed ( p < 0.05) at 33 and 44% normal (courtesy S. DiMauro, MD). Southern blot identified no deletions in mitochondrial DNA and the tRNA gene point mutation of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers was absent.

Survival analysis may be used to evaluate the results, with time to sustained worsening of one step of Multiple Sclerosis the DSS as the milestone. To estimate sample sizes for this design, we did a survival analysis on data collected over 20 years in the UCLA Multiple Sclerosis Research and Treatment Program. Patients (n = 262) had an initial DSS between 3 and 6 and 3 or more visits to the clinic over 1 or more years. Actuarial analysis revealed that, after 1-year follow-up, 62 patients (24%) had worsened and 11 patients (496) were lost to follow-up. By 2 years, 91 (35%) worsened and 28 (11%) were lost to follow-up. By 3 years, 118 (4595) worsened and 46 (18%) were lost. Based upon these data, Kaplan-Meier estimates for worsening by 1 year equalled 24%; for 2 years, 36%; and for 3 years, 50%. With these estimates, we would require a sample size of 82 patients per group to detect a 50% reduction in the rate of worsening in 2 years and 65 per group at 3 years (with a power of 80% andP108.

All patients had clinical involvement of spinal cord and optic nerves, without involvement of other CNS areas, even after many years of disease. MRI demonstrated spinal cord abnormalities in the absence of CNS findings elsewhere. CSF features included abnormal blood-brain barrier permeability to albumin with normal CNS IgG daily synthesis and absence of oligoclonal bands. Complete autopsies of 4 patients revealed optic nerve demyelination, severe necrosis of both spinal cord gray and white matter, and marked enlargement of small and medium-size spinal cord blood vessel walls, without inflammatory infiltrates. N o white matter abnormalities were found elsewhere in the CNS. The necrotizing spinal cord lesions involving both gray and white matter with thickened vessel walls, the absence of inflammatory infiltrates, and the normal CSF IgG profile place Devic's neuromyelitis optica among a distinct nosological category of necrotizing myelopathies, different from multiple sclerosis.P109.

We found overall that patients with OCB+ CSF (n = 30) had significantly ( p = ,005; [Mann-Whitney]) higher HSP6O Ab titers compared with those with OCB-CSF (n = 67). If the patients with MS were excluded, HSP6O titers in OCB + CSF (n = 15) did not differ significantly from the OCB-group (n = 64). Comparing HSP60 titers among patient groups, we found significantly higher levels in MS patients compared to the OND ( p = ,0005, analysis of variance), whereas only borderline significant differences were observed between MS and the ADEM ( p = .0487) or DPN ( p = .0597) patient groups, neither of whose levels were significantly different from OND. No significant correlation was observed between HSP6O titer and IgG content in the CSF. The elevated HSP6O Ab titers in patients with MS suggest an in vivo interaction between HSP6O and the immune system. P111.

The objectives of this cohort survey study were to Program and Abstracts, American Neurological Association 261 examine the frequency and etiology of SCIs in the workplace. All SCIs reported through the Spinal Cord Injury Early Notification System that occurred in Colorado during a fiveand-one-half-year period (1/ 1/86 through 6/6/91) were evaluated. Specific data of all SCIs occurring in the workplace were analyzed in detail. There were a total of 566 SCIs with 74 (13.1%) being due to injuries that occurred during the course of employment. The most common causes of occupational SCI were the result of falls at 37 (509%) compared to only 15.995 of nonoccupational SCI ( p < 0.001). Only 14 (18.95%) occupational SCIs resulted from MVAs, compared to 59.395 of nonoccupational SCIs (p < 0.00 I). Other major etiologies for occupational SCI included being hit by a falling 4%) of each of the following: skiing, stabbing, being struck in the head, and unknown. Construction occupations were overrepresented in occupational SCI withs 41.9% of cases compared to only 6.3% for the nonoccupational group ( p < 0.001). Because of the large percentage of occupational SCIs, efforts should be aimed at education of workers in at-risk occupations to prevent this serious injury.P123.

Posner, New York, N YA chart review was performed to determine the incidence and cause of seizures in 370 patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seizures were documented in 26, and were suspected in 3 others. Of the 26, 15 were male, and the mean age was 2 1 years. Seventeen patients had allogeneic transplants, and 9 had autologous transplants. Eleven patients had leukemia, 4 had lymphoma, 3 had aplastic anemia, 3 had immunodeficiency, and 5 had another illness. The patients received a variety of preparation regimens; 8 patients received CNS treatment or prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy, cranial radiation therapy, or both. Four patients had a prior history of seizures. The interval between bone marrow infusion and seizure was 119 days (range 1-637 days). Five patients (20%) had seizures less than 1 week after BMT, and 13 patients (50%) had seizures more than 2 months after BMT. Nineteen had generalized seizures, 3 had focal seizures, and 3 had both (1 was not described). Five patients were febrile at the time of seizure. Postictal examination revealed altered mental status in 19 patients and localizing signs in 5. Twelve patients were neutropenic at the time of seizure, and 18 had platelet counts <5OK. A probable cause was determined in 21/26 patients. Fourteen had a CNS disease: 8 had intracranial hemorrhage, 3 had CNS infection, 2 had meningeal leukemia, and 1 had multiple infarcts. Seven had systemic events, metabolic disturbance, or infection: 2 seizures after respiratory insufficiency, 2 after syncope; 1 was hyponatremic, 1 was septic, and 1 had a seizure during benzodiazepine withdrawal. In 5 patients, no cause was found. Seizures recurred in 10 patients during an average length of patient follow-up of 15 1 days from initial seizure. There were 17 deaths; 9 were within 2 weeks of seizure. We conclude that seizures occur in approximately 8% of patients after BMT, often several months after infusion. In 20%, no cause of the seizure can be determined. More than one-third suffer recurrence of seizures.P232. Ceramide Induces Changes of Differentiation inMark H.

            "text": "Hemispatial placement is known to affect line bisection in patients with neglect. Whereas placing stimuli in neglected space increases bisection error, placing stimuli in nonneglected space attenuates error. The effects of hemispatial placement on line bisection were examined in 4 patients with chronic neglect (over 5 months after stroke). All patients had large (frontotemporoparietal), unilateral, right-hemisphere lesions. Each patient bisected lines of different lengths (24, 26, 28 , and 30 cm) in 3 hemispatial conditions (30 cm left of midline, midline, and 30 cm right of midline). Like previous reports, when patients bisected lines in left hemispace, a consistent (20/24 trials) left-sided neglect was observed (2.6 cm). However, when lines were bisected in center space, misbisections occurred on either side of the midline; and, unlike previous studies, when lines were bisected in right hemispace, a consistent (20/24 trials) right-sided neglect was observed (2.0 cm). The magnitude and directional consistency of line bisection errors were significant. Neither visual field defects nor limitations in reaching accounted for the results. Recovery in chronic neglect may involve a realignment of limited attentional resources favoring the body's midline. Consequently, performance in both hemispatial fields can be biased toward midline, resulting in neglect of opposite directions. Despite agreement that depression is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), many aspects of this emotional change are unclear. One of the more controversial issues concerns the relationship between severity of MS and depression. This relationship is used to evaluate whether depression is an integral or reactive symptom of MS. Examination of this relationship is complicated by the presumed overlap between somatic features of depressive and neurological symptoms in MS. To clarify this situation, we examined the relationship between severity of MS and 4 categories of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Eighty-nine patients and 47 normal controls were examined. For certain comparisons, patients were classified as mild (Extended Disability Status Scale of 0-2) or moderatelsevere (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Results indicated that total BDI scores and the depressive symptom categories (mood, self-reproach, vegetative, and somatic features) were elevated in patients with MS, but the extent of these elevations was not related to severity of disease. These results suggest that depression in MS is not a simple reaction to physical disability. Furthermore, clinical examination of depressive symptoms is straightforward and not confounded by severity of MS. Neurological involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis was studied in 324 consecutive patients diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic. One hundred and nine patients (34%) had neurological involvement. Peripheral neuropathy was seen in 53 (16.4%), cranial neuropathy in 2 1, external ophthalmoplegia in 16, cerebrovascular events in 13, seizures in 10, and miscellaneous involvement in 25. The mean age and sex ratio did not differ in those with or without neurological involvement. Among the patients with peripheral neuropathy, 42 had multiple mononeuropathy, 6 had distal symmetric polyneuropathy, and 5 had unclassified peripheral neuropathy. Multiple mononeuropathy was one of the major presenting symptoms in 8 patients. Kidney involvement was significantly higher in the patients with peripheral neuropathy compared to those without it (p < 0.001). Among the cranial nerves, the second, sixth, and seventh nerves were affected most frequently. Multiple cranial nerves were affected in 8 patients. Unusual neurological manifestations among the miscellaneous group included spastic paraparesis, temporal arteritis, Homer's syndrome, and papilledema. This is the first comprehensive study on the frequency and distribution of neurological involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis.",
