The patient reported that he suddenly developed convulsion with teeth clenching and limb shaking, when resting on a sofa on the day of initial presentation, and symptoms resolved spontaneously after a few seconds. But when he was trying to get up, he noticed a back pain and was unable to move his lower limbs. He sought medical attention at Wuhan Hanyang District Hospital and was hospitalized. Computed tomography (CT) of thoracolumbar spine showed burst fracture of the 12th thoracic vertebra and the compression fracture of 1st lumbar vertebral. Incidentally CT showed bilateral pulmonary exudative changes (Fig. 1\n), indicating a possible infection of COVID-19.",

The C-arm was used to locate the injured vertebra, followed by incision of the skin and subcutaneous fascia, kyphotic deformity of T12 and L1 was seen. Screws and longitudinal rod were placed from T11 to L2 and retracted, with the kyphosis deformity resolved. The incision was rinsed with saline multiple times, and vancomycin was evenly sprinkled on the incision. After surgery, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for recovery from general anesthesia. The whole operation lasted 2 hours and 43 minutes.",

Therefore, we tried very best to avoid any risk after surgery. Regarding the stable signs of the patient, we mainly focused on radiographic and laboratory tests, such as lung computed tomography (CT), white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, etc. Most importantly, plasma cytokines, lymphocyte clustering and antibody detection are routinely examined, which was reported to be important indicators of the prognosis. In this patient, we found IL-2, IL-4, 1L-6, and IL-10 levels were elevated after operation and IL-2 level was reduced significantly when checking again, indicating a transient inflammatory response instead of cytokine storm. The patient had a good outcome, who had no cough, fever, pharyngeal swab nucleic acid rejuvenation or other symptoms after surgery, and lung CT showed lesion absorption. In summary, the surgical treatment did not aggravate the progression of COVID-19.",
