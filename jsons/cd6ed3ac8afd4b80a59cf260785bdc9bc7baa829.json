            "text": "aboratory diagnosis is important in managing influenza virus infection, either in the context of the annual winter outbreaks or in a pandemic. 1 Rapid and accurate influenza diagnosis improves medical management by allowing timely provision of antiviral therapy and prophylaxis, implementation of appropriate infection control strategies for individuals and public health responses to outbreaks, and limitation of unnecessary investigations or antibiotic therapy. 2 In the context of a threatened pandemic (whether due to the highly pathogenic influenza A/H5N1 virus currently causing disease among birds and some human contacts, or another novel virus), rapid laboratory detection of the first cases or clusters in Australia will be crucial. Australia's early response will hinge on containment and production of a vaccine to the pandemic strain. These responses depend on highly sensitive strain-specific laboratory testing that will exclude other respiratory pathogens. Should a pandemic spread around the world with the same impact as the 1918 pandemic, maintaining health care and other essential services will be paramount. To make treatment decisions in this situation, less reliance may be placed on immediate laboratory confirmation and more on the clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, laboratory detection will still be required for atypical and serious cases, for situations where there are special public health concerns, and to determine whether circulating strains are still sensitive to antiviral drugs or whether they are undergoing antigenic drift.",

Influenza virus RNA is detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus, potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late-presenting patients. When specimen quality is limited, such as with community-based surveillance programs involving postal submission of specimens, yields from RT-PCR are significantly higher than from cell culture. 12, 13, 21 Nucleic acid testing using H5N1-specific primers is the most sensitive assay for the diagnosis of human H5N1 infection. 8 Although the turnaround time for nucleic acid testing is intermediate between cell culture and direct antigen detection, newer techniques can reduce this to 4-5 hours or less. 20 Multiplex RT-PCR assays have been developed, and these can simultaneously detect influenza and other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens directly in clinical specimens. 1,20 RT-PCR can quantify the viral load in clinical specimens, as has been done in human H5N1-infected patients to assess prognosis and measure antiviral efficacy. 8, 22 Nucleic acid testing can subtype influenza viruses using subtypespecific primers, and analyse strain variation through genetic sequencing, thus complementing the traditional role of antigenic characterisation of viral isolates.",

Serological diagnosis of influenza is retrospective, as it requires acute and convalescent serum samples. Furthermore, it generally does not provide information on the antigenic composition of circulating strains. As influenza virus infection generally represents reinfection, most people have some preexisting immunity. Thus, the detection of influenza-specific IgG or total antibodies on a single serum specimen is not diagnostic of recent infection. The definitive serological diagnosis of acute influenza requires the demonstration of increasing antibody titres on paired acute and convalescent serum samples. Unfortunately, acute specimens are frequently not collected. However, a single high antibody titre in the context of a compatible clinical illness during a period of circulating influenza activity provides presumptive evidence of recent infection. ",

The traditional \"gold standard\" techniques for detecting influenza-specific antibodies are neutralisation and the haemagglutination inhibition assay, as they can differentiate subtype-specific (including H5N1) and strain-specific serological responses. Antibody levels correlate accurately with protection from (or susceptibility to) influenza, and with vaccination responses. Complement fixation is more commonly used as it is easier to perform than the haemagglutination inhibition assay and neutralisation, but it does not distinguish between subtypes. Recent influenza infection is suggested by a fourfold rise in complement fixation titre or by a single high titre. 1, 23 Antiviral susceptibility testing Two classes of drugs are effective against influenza virus infection: the adamantane M2 channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), and the neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir). 24, 25 Amantadine resistance emerges within a few days of treatment onset in 25%-35% of patients, and is mediated by amino acid substitutions in the M2 transmembrane region. Adamantane resistance is increasing around the world. 24, 25 Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance is most commonly associated with a variety of amino acid substitutions in the conserved residues of the neuraminidase enzyme active site. To date, however, viruses with these mutations have shown impaired replication in cell culture and animal models. Mutations in the haemagglutinin receptor-binding site can occur, leading to reduced viral dependence on neuraminidase function. 24 Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors was rarely seen in immunocompetent humans during clinical trials, although more recent reports of children infected with influenza A in Japan, and some Vietnamese human H5N1 patients treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, showed that resistance may be more common than initially supposed. 22, 25 Resistant mutations have been detected after treatment of immunocompromised individuals, a situation that requires further study.",

Testing will have to be rapid to identify the first arrivals and clusters of disease, and to allow early antiviral treatment, prophylaxis and infection control. Other causes of respiratory infection will need to be excluded. Early identification will require cooperation and communication between public health officers, treating clinicians, and public and private laboratories. If the pandemic becomes widespread in Australia, testing strategies may change. One could argue that clinical identification will then suffice, and that laboratory testing should be limited to patients requiring hospital admission or for particular outbreaks. Non-pandemic strain-specific influenza assays, such as immunofluorescence or immunochromatographic rapid antigen tests, may be useful in identifying influenza infection during these pandemic stages. Antiviral resistance testing is not yet routinely available in Australia, but will be important if antiviral drugs are used extensively during a pandemic.",
