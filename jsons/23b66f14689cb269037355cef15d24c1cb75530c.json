As shown in Figure 1 , the genomes of some subspecies HAdV-87 B1 types encode a third highly polymorphic E3-CR1 gene designated CR1\u03b4 (Frietze et al., 2010; 88 Kajon et al., 2005) . These 3 genes have very low sequence similarity to any other known AdV 89 genes or to other sequences in the NCBI/GenBank database, making sequence-based prediction 90 of biological function challenging.",

The constitutively expressed Rig/S15 was amplified as a 239 housekeeping control using the primers described above. The cycle number for amplification of 240 all CR1 genes and Rig/S15 was optimized empirically and set at 20 to fit within the exponential 241 range of amplification. The amplification products were analyzed by horizontal electrophoresis 242 on 1% agarose gels. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on the same set of cDNA samples 243 in a QuantStudio5 instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) with PowerUp SYBR 244 Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL Cat# A25741) and the internal and 245 junction primer sets and the Rig/S15 primers described above. Each sample was tested in 246 duplicate. The data were normalized to Rig/S15. Fold changes in gene expressions relative to the 247 0 h time point were determined using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method. were detected using two different sets of primers that distinguish early transcripts from MLP 314 transcripts. E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K transcripts were detectable as early as 6 hpi and were 315 abundantly produced at late times pi, as MLP transcripts carrying the TPL sequence at their 5' 316 end ( Figure 3A ). To validate these observations we performed quantitative PCR and readily 317 detected E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K MLP transcripts by 24 hpi ( Figure S5 ). Expression of both E3-318 20.1K and E3-20.5K proteins was detectable at 12 hpi, peaked at 48 hpi, and decreased by 72 hpi 319 ( Figure 3B ). Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that at 24 hpi both E3-20.1K and 320 E3-20.5K predominantly co-localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and to a lesser extent at the plasma 321 membrane ( Figure 4A ). In an attempt to define the identity of the cytoplasmic vesicles, we performed co-localization studies using antibodies specific to PDI an endoplasmic reticulum 323 (ER) marker, Golgin-97, a trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker, EEA1, an early lysosome marker, 324 and LAMP2, a late endosome/lysosome marker. We observed that at 24 hpi both E3-20.1K and 325 E3-20.5K were present in the ER, TGN, and in early endosomes but not in late ",

We generated a double knock out virus (HAdV-3 N-tag DKO) that397 does not express E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K proteins (Figure S2A and S2B). A549 cells were 398 infected with HAdV-3 wt, HAdV-3 N-tag wt or, HAdV-3 N-tag DKO mutant virus at a MOI of 399 1 pfu/cell. At different times pi the extracellular compartment (supernatant) (Figure 9A) or whole 400 dish contents (total virus: cell monolayer and supernatant) (Figure 9B) were sampled to 401 determine infectious virus loads. We observed no difference in infectious virus titers in either the 402 extracellular compartment or in the total virus yields between cells infected with HAdV-3 wt, 403 HAdV-3 N-tag wt, or HAdV-3 N-tag DKO. The contribution of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K to 404 HAdV-3 spread in cell culture was evaluated using a dissemination assay and by examination of 405 plaque phenotypes. We observed no differences in viral spread phenotype (Figure 9C), or in 406 plaque size and morphology (Figure S9) between wt and DKO-infected cells. of work provides a foundational characterization of HAdV-3-encoded E3-CR1\u03b2 410 and E3-CR1\u03b3. These HAdV-B-specific E3-CR1 proteins are conserved among human and simian 411 types and present in all examined genomes indicating that they are highly likely to contribute to 412 virus-host interactions occurring during infection. In infected A549 cells the two proteins were 413 readily detectable at late times post infection, presumably as a result of translation of MLP transcripts. The results of our recent studies determining the critical contribution of the TPL 415 sequence to the successful ectopic expression of HAdV-B and HAdV-E E3 CR1 genes (Bair et 416 al., 2017) suggest that the presence of this non-coding element is essential for efficient 417 translation of HAdV-3 E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K transcripts at late times post infection. 418 Our data show that E3-20.1K is only N-glycosylated while, as previously reported by Hawkins 419 and Wold (Hawkins and Wold, 1995), HAdV-3 E3-20.5K is both N-and O-glycosylated. We 420 also conclusively demonstrate that E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K are type I transmembrane proteins 421 that co-localize predominantly to the cytoplasmic vesicles at 24 hpi and to the plasma membrane 422 at 48 hpi in non-polarized epithelial cells (A549 and HEK 293Ts). 423 A thorough examination of the subcellular localization of these proteins by confocal 424 fluorescence microscopy at 24 hpi revealed that at steady-state both proteins localize to the ER, 425 TGN, and early endosomes but not to the late endosomes/lysosomes. These results suggest that 426 E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K traffic to the plasma membrane along the secretory pathway. 427 Interestingly, we observed that a considerable proportion of the detectable E3-20.1K and E3-428 20.5K at 24 hpi localized to cytoplasmic vesicles that could not be identified by our efforts. This 429 suggests that the proteins may be delivered to the plasma membrane by secretory vesicles or by 430 unconventional pathways including secretory autophagy (Cotzomi-Ortega et al., 2018) 431 warranting additional studies using an expanded panel of markers. The fact that E3-20.1K and 432 E3-20.5K co-immunoprecipitate suggests that these proteins may work together to carry out their 433 biological functions. 434 In a recent study of the HAdV E3-CR1 host extracellular interactome using C-terminal IgG 435 Fc fusion of the E3 CR1 protein ectodomains as baits and an extracellular protein microarray, interacts with the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors and 438 inhibits T-cell activation. The N-terminal domain of HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b3 was also shown to 439 interact with SLAM receptors, although the functional implications of this interaction were not 440 investigated (Martinez-Martin et al., 2016). Our study shows that the C-termini of both E3-20.1K 441 and E3-20.5K have a class II PBM suggesting that these proteins may carry out additional 442 functions within the host cell through interactions with PDZ proteins. Multiple sequence analysis 443 indicates that the class II PBM is conserved among the E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 proteins of all of 444 simian and human members of species HAdV-B. 445 The LL motif was found in all of the examined HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 proteins. 446 The YXX\u03a6 motif is present in all of the E3-CR1\u03b2 proteins encoded by human types and in most 447 of the E3-CR1\u03b2 proteins encoded by simian members of the species. Interestingly, while the 448 YXX\u03a6 motif is also present in many of the E3-CR1\u03b3 proteins encoded by simian HAdV-B, it is 449 not present in any of the E3-CR1\u03b3 encoded by human types classified within this species. The 450 LL and YXX\u03a6 motifs are sorting signals that aid in the trafficking of proteins through the 451 secretory pathway and in the targeting of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface of 452 polarized epithelial cells (Heilker et al., 1999; Miranda et al., 2001). Like the LL motif in HAdV-453 D-specific E3-49K, the LL motif in HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 does not fit the consensus 454 sequence of acidic (D/E)XXXL(L/I) or DXXLL di-leucine motifs (Windheim et al., 2016). The 455 LL motif of HAdV-D E3-49K was shown to be important for trafficking of the full length 456 protein and the C-terminal portion of the cleaved protein from the cell surface to the early 457 endosome/trans Golgi network (TGN) and lysosomes, respectively (Windheim et al., 2016). Our 458 observations of subcellular localization of ectopically-expressed mutant versions of HAdV-3 E3-459 20.1K and E3-20.5K indicate that, at least in our experimental system, obliteration of the LL motif or deletion of the class II PBM did not affect the localization of these proteins to the 461 plasma membrane. Likewise, deletion of the N-terminal or C-terminal domains while retaining 462 the transmembrane domain did not alter the localization of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K. These 463 results indicate that the TM domain of these proteins is sufficient for localization to the plasma 464 membrane and that neither the LL nor the class II PBM nor the YXX\u03a6 motifs play a critical role 465 in their trafficking to the plasma membrane in non-polarized cells. 466The presence of a class II PBMs in the extreme C-termini of HAdV-B E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-467 CR1\u03b3 has not been previously reported. The identified PBMs have the typical 4-amino acid 468 length and the localization described for PBMs in general and are therefore anticipated to be 469 functional(Hung and Sheng, 2002; Nourry et al., 2003). The PBM has the potential to confer 470 these HAdV-B-specific E3-CR1 proteins the ability to interact with PDZ-domain containing host 471 proteins and therefore deserves further investigation for elucidation of functional implications.472Our thorough examination of E3-CR1 protein sequences for a wide range of HAdV types 473 representing species HAdV-A through -G identified a putative class II PBM (-SLTV COOH ), at the 474 extreme C-terminus of E3-CR1\u03b2/11.6K encoded by various strains of HAdV-C5 (AC_000008, 475 AY601635, KX868466, KF429754, MF681662 among others) but intriguingly, not by E3-476 CR1\u03b2/11.6K of types HAdV-C1, -C2 and -C6 (data not shown). We also observed that the C-477 termini of E3-CR1\u03b1 proteins encoded by HAdV-D8 (AB448769), -D9 (AJ854486), -D15 478 (AB562586), -D19 (AB448774), -D37 (AB448778), -D46 (AY875648), -D56 (HM770721), and 479 -D64 (EF121005) possess a class III PBM (consensus sequence (D/E)X\u03a6, where X = any amino 480 acid, and \u03a6 = hydrophobic amino acid) (data not shown).",

            "text": "In humans, PDZ domains are found in over 200 proteins that primarily contribute to the 482 generation and maintenance of cell-cell junctions and cell polarity, or that are involved in cellular signal transduction pathways.(Assemat et al., 2008; Spaller, 2006). Several viral 484 proteins are known to encode PBMs that target host PDZ domain-containing proteins to485 modulate cellular processes in support of virus replication, viral pathogenesis, and virus 486 dissemination or transmission to new host (Javier and Rice, 2011). For example, adenovirus E4-487 ORF1 contains a class I PBM (-ATLV COOH ) through which E4-ORF1 binds PDZ domain 488 containing proteins to disrupt epithelial cell junctions of infected cells (Latorre et al., 2005). The 489 SARS coronavirus envelope protein E contains a Class II PBM (-DLLV COOH ) that mediates the 490 interaction of the protein with PALS1, affecting tight junction formation in infected cells (Teoh 491 et al., 2010). 492 Our results show that unlike the HAdV-C-specific E3-CR1\u03b2/ADP (Tollefson et al., 1996a; 493 Tollefson et al., 1996b), HAdV-3-encoded E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 do not play a role in virus 494 progeny release, cell-to-cell spread or plaque formation in non-polarized cells. However, the 495 subcellular localization of E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 as well as their contribution to virus progeny 496 release and their effect on epithelial barrier integrity should be re-examined in polarized 497 epithelial cells. By using our HAdV-3 mutants in a more physiologically relevant experimental 498 system, the role of these two CR1 proteins during the HAdV-B's life cycle may be more easily 499 unveiled and protein-protein interactions more accurately localized to specific cellular domains. 500 The Syrian hamster recently shown by Radke and colleagues (Radke et al., 2016) to support 501 replication of HAdV-14, a member of species HAdV-B, is an interesting animal model to be 502 considered for the examination of the role of E3-CR1\u03b2 and E3-CR1\u03b3 during infection in vivo.503The detection of HAdV-14 hexon protein in the lungs of infected hamsters suggests that E3-CR1 504 proteins would be expressed at detectable levels in this host, opening new opportunities for viral 505 pathogenesis studies.",

Next, Retroscript Reverse Transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, Cat# AM1710) was used to reverse-transcribe 1 \u03bcg of DNAse-treated RNA. The cDNA was then used as a template for amplification with either internal primers E3-",

At 72 h post transfection, total cell lysates were analyzed by WB for expression of E3-20.1K and E3-20.5K with anti-tag antibodies. Additionally, the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti VSV-G or anti HA conjugated magnetic beads to pull down E3-20.1K or E3-20.5K respectively. Pulled down samples were analyzed by WB for the presence of E3-20.5K or E3-20.1K, respectively. The blot is representative of three independent experiments.",
