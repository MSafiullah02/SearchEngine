            "text": "Recently, we reported the unexpected discovery that several high temperature (but not ultrahigh temperature) DNA polymerases could support standard PCR amplification by using primers that contained components of a self\u2010avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS).8 In a SAMRS oligonucleotide, A, T, G, and C nucleobases are substituted at some (but not necessarily all) sites.9 In these oligonucleotides, the hydrogen\u2010bonding units are strategically substituted with four replacement nucleotides (A*, T*, G*, and C*, Figure 2). SAMRS A* pairs with natural T, SAMRS T* pairs with natural A, SAMRS G* pairs with natural C, and SAMRS C* pairs with natural G. However, A*:T* and C*:G* base\u2010pairs do not contribute to the stability of the helix, because they either form one or 1.5 bonds (Figure 2). This means that oligonucleotides built from SAMRS components do not interact with each other, no matter what their concentration, which allows them to bind solely to their intended targets. Indeed, in a variety of standard PCR methods, we found that by placing SAMRS nucleotides in the 3\u2032\u2010end of PCR primers, primer\u2010dimers could mostly be avoided.8\u20139 This was true even when the primers were extremely poorly designed. For example, Hoshika et al. demonstrated how SAMRS components could prevent primer\u2010dimer formation even when the 3\u2032\u2010sequences of the primers form perfect formal matches in a 9 base\u2010pair duplex.8\n",

In particular, because SAMRS:standard base\u2010pairs are joined by only two hydrogen bonds, their contribution to duplex stability is similar to the weaker natural A:T base\u2010pair, and we were concerned that this would prevent RPA from working with SAMRS\u2010containing primers. Furthermore, enzymes for recombination have evolved for billions of years to be highly specific for DNA; these general considerations predict that recombinases might not accept structurally altered nucleotides. Herein, we report data showing that SAMRS is compatible with RPA and reverse transcriptase RPA (RT\u2010RPA).",

The pairing between SAMRS components and their complementary natural nucleotides (C*:G, G*C, T*:A, and A*:T) are all weak relative to the standard C:G pair and comparable to the strength of the A:T pair (because they are joined by just two hydrogen bonds or, in the case of C*:G, a weakened set of three hydrogen bonds). Therefore, we found in practice it is best not to place SAMRS components at all sites in a primer. Rather, we recommend that SAMRS nucleotides be placed near the 3\u2032\u2010ends of the primers, generally at sites n\u22121, n\u22122, n\u22123, and n\u22124, where n is the 3\u2032\u2010terminal (last) site of the oligonucleotide primer. This allows the primer to be synthesized on an oligonucleotide support beginning from a standard nucleotide (which reduces costs).

Furthermore, RPA reactions generate background noise; the products that generate this noise are rarely sequenced, but are usually thought to arise from undesired interactions between or within the primers. These artifacts interfere with the desired amplification through the unproductive consumption of primers (tying up the resources of the assay), which produces duplexes that are also stained by the DNA dyes and impedes the amplification of the preferred product. Therefore, it is usually necessary to screen many primers to identify a set for any specific RPA target that work, minimize primer noise, and provide acceptable sensitivity for the assay.",

In these reactions, varying concentrations of the influenza A DNA template was used with STD or SAMRS primers. As shown in Figure 3 B, real\u2010time amplification with STD primers resulted in a nonspecific signal. The noise arising from this nonspecific signal made it difficult to identify a signal that correlated with the amount of target DNA added (Figure 3 B). In contrast, sensitive and exponential amplification of DNA template was observed by using the SAMRS primers and EvaGreen dye (Figure 3 C). The amplification detection threshold (C\np) depends linearly on the copy number of the input template when SAMRS primers were used (insets, Figures 3 B,C). Thus, by allowing for a simpler detection method and avoiding the need for gel electrophoresis, SAMRS primers simplified the assay. This means that SAMRS primers improve RPA as an amplification method and are potentially useful for point\u2010of\u2010care and low\u2010resource\u2010environment applications. The background signal is not completely eliminated by using SAMRS primers, however, they do reduce noise sufficiently to allow the detection of as few as 1000 molecules of target DNA. Although we explored (without optimization) only one SAMRS primer design, with just four SAMRS components placed on the penultimate four nucleotides, other designs may further reduce the background signal and further increase the sensitivity of these assays.",

Using USEARCH, these sequences were clustered with other Coronavirdae genomes to identify all closely related species.11 All sequences within the 2cEMC viral cluster (such as bat coronavirus HKU5 genomes) were then input into MUSCLE to create a multiple sequence alignment (MSA).12 This MSA was used as the input for StrainTargeter, which found sets of amplification primers and probes that captured all 2cEMC genomes while avoiding hits to other RNA virus species within the MSA. Ten sets of primers and probes where chosen to be specific to multiple regions throughout the genome. These sets were then compared against NCBI's RNA virus (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses), Ensembl's human genome (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-76/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/), and The Broad Institute mosquito genome databases (https://olive.broadinstitute.org/collections/anopheles.1) to ensure that no combination of chosen primers and probes from any of the sets would cross\u2010react with other RNA viruses or human genomes. Two primers were synthesized both with SAMRS components and, for comparison, with entirely standard nucleotides.",

Thus, SAMRS converts RPA from a method suited only for the research laboratory into one that has practical value in the field, at points\u2010of\u2010care, and in low\u2010resource environments. We expect that SAMRS will also make the creation of RPA\u2010based diagnostics faster, by eliminating the need for primer optimization and allowing primers to be designed to match the biology (e.g. to target conserved/variable regions) rather than to just \u201cget something that works\u201d.
