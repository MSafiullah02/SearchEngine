Based on the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) criteria, we performed oropharyngeal swab rRT-PCR on days 8 and 11, and both results were negative.

He was admitted for observation to an airborne-isolation unit at our hospital and received only symptomatic treatment. On February 2 nd , fever and cough started to improve.

However, other reports described the case in which viral RNA persisted detectable after 21 days of illness, or reoccurrence of viral detection was observed after rRT-PCR negative confirmation [14, 15] . The detectable duration of viral RNA may vary from case to case.",
