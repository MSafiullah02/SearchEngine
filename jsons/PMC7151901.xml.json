Often, these counterfeit screening hits have peculiar behaviors that cannot be reconciled with canonical modes of inhibition. These compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are discarded, typically after a great deal of time and resources has been devoted to them.",

Experimental artifact, such as compound impurity12 or assay interference,7, 13 is a well-known cause. Inhibitor promiscuity due to reactive groups14, 15 or privileged scaffolds16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 has also been described. More recently, aggregate formation has emerged as a potential mechanism of promiscuous inhibition.23, 24 This model proposes that some nonspecific inhibitors form aggregates in solution and that the aggregate species is responsible for enzyme inhibition (Figure 1\n). Preliminary studies suggest that aggregate-forming promiscuous compounds may be common among screening libraries and hit lists. This chapter will initially focus on nonspecific enzyme inhibition as caused by aggregate-forming molecules and will review experimental methods for the identification of such compounds. Computational algorithms for the prediction of all types of promiscuous inhibitors will then be discussed and outstanding questions regarding promiscuous inhibitors in drug discovery will be considered.",

These promiscuous compounds showed time-dependent inhibition that was sensitive to enzyme concentration, the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and ionic strength. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the nonspecific compounds formed aggregates in solution, and the aggregate particles caused enzyme inhibition (Figure 1).23 Consistent with this hypothesis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the promiscuous compounds formed particles on the order of 30\u20131000 nm in diameter; these particles were absent from solutions of nonpromiscuous compounds.23\n",

There has also been a growing interest in the development of computational models to predict compounds likely to act as aggregate formers because such filters could be used to remove suspect molecules from screening libraries or from hit lists.

This assay requires that the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme remains elevated, on the order of 1000:1 or greater, even after the enzyme concentration has been increased. Many assays may not be able to tolerate increases in enzyme concentration due to cost, limited reagent availability, or an increased reaction rate that makes it technically difficult to obtain accurate velocity measurements.

Instead, they found that the compound behaved as a parabolic, noncompetitive inhibitor, and they proposed that the kinetic signature of time-dependent inhibition with a nonlinear dependence on inhibitor concentration may be a marker for aggregation.28 Future studies to evaluate the generalization of this observation are certainly anticipated.

If inhibition without incubation decreases from 50% to less than 40%, the result is consistent with the time-dependent behavior observed of aggregators. Control experiments include repeating the assay with a specific, nontime-dependent inhibitor of the target enzyme as well as a known aggregator.

In a standard setup, a sample of the solution under study is placed in a chamber and exposed to a laser. Particles in the sample cause the laser light to scatter. A detector at a fixed angle relative to the chamber records the scattered photons over a period of time, usually tens of seconds to minutes. Because particles in the sample undergo Brownian motion, the intensity of the scattered light measured by the detector will fluctuate, typically on the microsecond timescale. These fluctuations reflect the rate of diffusion by the particle in solution, which in turn depends on the hydrodynamic radius of the particle according to the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation. The necessary calculations are performed by software provided with the DLS instrument, and given certain assumptions about particle shape and distribution, the hydrodynamic radius can be used as a measure of particle size.

Notably, GFP retains its fluorescence signal in the presence of I4PTH, suggesting that the protein is not denatured by the aggregates (Figure 4b). Higher resolution imaging of similar solutions of \u03b2-galactosidase and I4PTH obtained by transmission electron microscopy show that the protein adsorbs onto the surface of the inhibitor aggregate (Figure 4e), and with the addition of detergent, this interaction is prevented (Figure 4f). These observations, in combination with biochemical and biophysical studies, suggest that enzyme is adsorbed onto the surface of the aggregate particles and thereby inhibited, although absorption into the aggregate interior cannot be excluded.24 Furthermore, the interaction between aggregate and enzyme can be prevented or reversed by the addition of Triton X-100.24\n",

These compounds were culled from compounds that had hit in at least eight different HTS assays, compounds from an in-house depository that had been requested by at least six different discovery projects, and additional compounds from various sites within Roche.53 Eleven teams of medicinal chemists voted on the structures to identify molecules that according to their expert opinion and experience were likely to be frequent hitters.

To better define the relevant moieties, structural descriptors were calculated for a series of reactive compounds. The probability of reactivity (P\nR) for any given structure was then defined as the sum over all structural descriptors of the number of occurrences of each descriptor in that compound weighted by the TRI for that descriptor. If the P\nR for a compound was greater than 0.3, the compound was predicted to be reactive. The TRI for each descriptor was determined by using nonlinear regression to maximize the agreement between observed and predicted reactivity as described by a scoring function.15\n",

Indeed, it is interesting to speculate on possible consequences of aggregation by drugs. But aggregation at micromolar concentrations leading to inhibition of nontarget receptors does not change the fact that the drug also inhibits its target at nanomolar concentrations. This is the important difference between a drug that inhibits off-pathway targets via aggregation and a hit that inhibits its screening target via aggregation. The purpose of screening is to find new leads for inhibitor design. A screening hit that is only active because it inhibits its target receptor via aggregation is likely not a good starting point for further design work and should be abandoned. Furthermore, even though the screening hit shares the same pathology (aggregation) as a real drug, it does not necessarily follow that it may also share the same desired feature (classical inhibition of a target).

For instance, some enzymes are more susceptible to inhibition by aggregators than other enzymes. Is this due to variations in protein size, shape, surface charge distribution, or other physicochemical property? Additionally, most work to date has been done with soluble enzymes, but aggregators have also been identified in screens using membrane-bound receptors.23 Do aggregating compounds generally inhibit surface receptors? If so, how does inhibition compare to that of soluble enzymes? Can aggregators act as agonists as well as antagonists? These questions are active areas of research, and results from these studies are eagerly anticipated.",

            "text": "A final area of interest concerns the SARs among aggregators. What distinguishes aggregators from nonaggregators? What factors determine the size of the particle formed by each aggregator? Preliminary observations have been made by a few groups. For instance, Frenkel and colleagues analyzed SARs among 15 aggregating NNRTIs and found that compounds containing oxygen atoms tended to form larger particles.44 The authors proposed that oxygen's ability to serve as a hydrogen bond donor could result in different interactions from a similarly placed carbon or nitrogen atom and consequently lead to different aggregation patterns. In a separate study, Seidler and co-workers studied a series of azole antifungals, four of which were aggregate formers and two of which were not.27 Interestingly, the two nonaggregators are prescribed as orally available medications, but the four aggregators are only administered as topical agents. These compounds could be distinguished from each other based on their ClogP values, with the aggregators having a ClogP greater than 5 and the nonaggregators having a value less than 5.27 In addition to physical properties, potential structural descriptors have been suggested by the various computational models described above. Additionally, pharmacophore-based methods may be a useful approach for studying SARs among these compounds. It is hoped that as more small molecules are explicitly studied for aggregation, the structural influences leading to aggregation will be better defined and the mechanism itself will be better understood.",
