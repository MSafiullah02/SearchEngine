From medical schools to residency programs, from patient interactions at home to those in quarantine, virtual communication is providing a safe way to continue with our responsibilities during this pandemic. According to POTUS (17 March 2020), telemedicine, with lessened HIPAA regulations, is now an approved method of communication between physicians and patients for those with Medicare [1]. Telemedicine provides protection to both the physician and patient, preventing possible spread of COVID-19 while allowing for continued patient care. It is now vital to make practical, effective use of telecommunications to stabilize the healthcare system.",

Our ability to control this pandemic relies on the strength and availability of our healthcare teams.
