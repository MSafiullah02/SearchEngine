Since late December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread out from its first epicenter, the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China [1], and has shortly become a pandemic [2]. Epidemiological data are mainly available for those countries most hardly hit by COVID-19, such as People's Republic of China [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]], Italy [10] and the USA [[11], [12], [13]]. More limited information is available for countries like Israel. On the other hand, these surveys mainly deal with clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, in terms of related risk factors or underlying co-morbidities, whereas unsatisfactory information is provided regarding the therapeutic interventions adopted. Furthermore, these studies are mostly clinical reports, case-series, or are designed as specific cohort studies targeting specific populations, and are not conducted at the level of entire communities, for example exploiting computerized clinical records and similar \u201creal-world data\u201d [14]. A notable exception is represented by the report published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, that analyzed the characteristics of 72,314 COVID-19 patients, even though only 62% of the entire sample consisted of confirmed cases [3]. Thus, currently available data do not enable to address some crucial research questions, especially in terms of therapeutics [15,16].",

Since NPIs are resource-consuming, being unfeasible and unsustainable for long periods in the western countries and given that the discovery of new vaccine candidates or new chemical/molecular entities (NCEs/NMEs), the design and the implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are time-consuming procedures, some scholars are attempting to repurpose already existing compounds.",

Subjects negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as the control group. Criteria for testing were established according to the guidelines published by the Israeli Ministry of Health (\u201cGuidelines for coping with the novel coronavirus\u201d, 2020, Ministry of Health, Israel) [17], which included an acute febrile illness or respiratory symptoms (cough or shortness of breath) in people returning from abroad travels or who were in close contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days. The MHS database was also extensively mined to collect all available information on demographics, the most recent documented body mass index (BMI), medical conditions, dispensed and prescribed hydroxychloroquine and colchicine between January 1st 2020 and the date of first SARS-COV-2 test. Furthermore, the socioeconomic status (SES) was computed, defined according to the poverty index of each member as specified during the 2008 National Census, which takes into account several parameters, including household income, education, crowding, material conditions, and car ownership, among others.",

More than half (56%) of the patients were males and the major underlying co-morbidities were hypertension (18.6%), cardiovascular disease (14.4%) and DM (11.9%). In a population-based study evaluating the clinical characteristics of 1482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the USA [19] the majority of patients were males (54.4%) with a similar pattern of underlying co-morbidities, most commonly hypertension (49.7%), followed by obesity (48.3%), DM (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). More than 70% of patients were older than 50 years. In another cross-sectional study, the same pattern of co-morbidities \u2013 hypertension (18.6%, p < .001), cardiovascular disease (14.4%, p < .001) and DM (11.9%, p < .001) \u2013 and male gender predominance (56%, p < .001) were observed in a population with an average age of 52 years [11]. Thus, it is noticeable that underlying co-morbidities and gender are similar among the different populations, but a mean age discrepancy exists between our cohort (average age of 40.6 years) and the other mentioned studies. This discrepancy might be due to the relative high percentage of young population in Israel where the median age in 2020 is 30.5 years, ten years younger than the populations in the USA and mainland China [20]. This is even more noticeable in particular settings, such as COVID-19 endemic cities, where population (especially, ultra-orthodox Jewish populations with a high number of children per family) is even younger with respect to the country.",

This is not surprising given the well-known association between low SES and increased risk for infections [21]. In the USA, minorities like African Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of mortality compared to the Caucasian population, largely due to SES disparities [22,23].",

Regarding the anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine, results from experimental models found that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated and triggered by different SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, subsequently, can take part in the development of the \u201csevere adult respiratory distress syndrome\u201d (ARDS), a complication of the COVID-19 infection [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. As a major inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome [31], colchicine could be utilized for the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, three clinical trials are ongoing [27,32,33]. However, in our investigation, we failed to detect a potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine and colchicine. Even though these drugs had not been administered for anti-viral treatment purposes, we were not able to identify the main reason of such an administration. On the other hand, we can assume that patients receiving these drugs suffer from inflammatory diseases such as RA and SLE in the case of hydroxychloroquine [34] and FMF and gout in the case of colchicine [35,36].",
