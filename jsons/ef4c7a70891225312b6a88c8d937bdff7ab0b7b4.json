Study Design: The authors conducted a single-blind, prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods: Patients with sinus disease and a control group without sinus disease were enrolled in the study. A disease-specific, validated Sinonasal Outcomes Test survey (SNOT-20) was completed by the subjects and a generalized validated Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey (SF-36) was also completed. An endoscopically guided brush sampling of nasal mucous was obtained from the middle meatus. Fungal specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was performed on the obtained sample to identify one of 82 different species of fungus in the laboratory. Statistical analysis was used to categorize the recovered fungal DNA and to crossreference this information with the outcomes surveys. Results: The fungal recovery rate in the study was 45.9% in patients with sinus disease and 45.9% in control subjects. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis had a mean SNOT-20 score of 1.80 versus the control group mean score of 0.77 (P < .0001). SF-36 data similarly showed a statistically significant difference between diseased and control populations with controls scoring a mean of 80.37 and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis scoring a mean of 69.35 for a P value of .02. However, no statistical significance could be ascribed to the presence or absence of fungi recovered, the type of fungi recovered, or the possible impact of fungi on the quality-of-life survey results. Conclusion: The recovery rate of fungi from the middle meatus of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and a control population without chronic rhinosinusitis is 45.9% using QPCR techniques. No direct causation with regard to fungal species or presence was proven; however, a species grouping for future studies is proposed based on trends in this data and other reports. Disease-specific outcomes surveys revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups.",

The purpose of this study is to define the speciation of fungal elements found in patients with accurately diagnosed CRS and to compare the flora distribution with patients with no sinus disease or complaints. Previous testing techniques using fungal cultures sample nonspecific areas in the nose from the nasal vestibule to the nasopharynx. To alleviate this source of uncertainty concerning quantity and location of sampling, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) method was used to process the specimens obtained from the middle meatus under endoscopic guidance for speciation. Our results are presented with analysis and statistical review.",

            "text": "Sinusitis is the most common chronic condition for which a patient seeks the input of a physician. It is com-monly quoted that sinusitis accounts for between 22 and 30 million patient visits per year. 1 A huge pharmaceutical industry exists to produce drugs that have an effect on sinus conditions with sales figures in the billions of dollars. Panels and cooperative groups have met to try to create a standardized terminology to define sinusitis. The disease is often conveniently broken down into \"acute sinusitis\" and \"chronic sinusitis\" based on the time course of existing symptoms despite treatment. Chronic rhinosinusitis is often defined as a disorder of the sinuses that has been present for 12 weeks and persists despite treatment. It is presumptive that acute or subacute rhinosinusitis clears within 3 months. 2 Radiologic studies have been used to help define and diagnose sinus disease and computed tomography (CT) scan findings often play into the definition of whether rhinosinusitis is present or has cleared. Yet, findings on radiologic studies are not specific as to the causation of disease. 3 In fact, a simple upper respiratory infection can produce CT findings indistinguishable from CRS on film review and yet be entirely reversible with either little or no directed treatment. 4 Perhaps the reason for this confusion is that the causation of rhinosinusitis itself is currently not properly defined. Although the model of a simple bacterial or viral infection is suitable for understanding acute rhinosinusitis, an all-encompassing model of CRS clearly does not exist because this form of the disease presents with much greater variability. Chronic rhinosinusitis may or may not be accompanied by nasal polyposis, atopic allergy, fungal infection, chromosomal abnormality, immune dysfunction, or other metabolic dysfunction.",

            "text": "Much recent work has been done to help define the role of antifungal treatment in CRS. 5 Fungi may participate in the pathophysiology of CRS in a variety of ways either as a direct invasive infection as is seen in mucormycosis or as an IGE-mediated inflammatory agent as seen in allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS). 6 -8 Other mechanisms of fungal participation in sinus inflammation have been proposed, including the concept of allergic mucin fungal sinusitis and the concept described in culturebased studies, which implicates a causative mechanism based on eosinophil-mediated chronic inflammation. 9, 10 This latter concept was unique enough to warrant issuance of a U.S. patent for the application of antifungal medication \"for treating and preventing inflammation of mucosal tissue\". 11 Although the presence of fungus itself in the nasal cavity of a patient would have at one time been thought to be unusual or even alarming, it has now been shown that the presence of fungal elements in the nasal respiratory tract is in fact common. 10, 12, 13 A culture-based study has implied that all humans with or without sinus infection retain fungus in the nasal cavity as part of the background flora. 10, 12 A QPCR study has shown that a large percentage of patients with or without sinusitis have fungal elements present in the nasal cavity. 13 Furthermore, a second QPCR-based study has shown that the quantity of fungus in the nasal cavity is the same in patients with or without sinus disease. 14 A culture-based study has shown that newborn infants do not have fungus in their nasal cavity when born; however, by the age of 6 weeks, infants universally have nasal fungus that can be cultured using special techniques. 12 Some previously idiopathic diseases have been associated through QPCR identification techniques with groupings of fungal species. Vesper et al. in a study of waterdamaged, moldy homes found that there are 26 molds associated with water-damaged environments and that 10 fungal species are present in essentially all homes. 15 They were able to link the species recovered in water-damaged environments with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage. 15 This study categorized the fungi found in a water-damaged environment as group I molds and refers to other fungi found commonly in a household environment as group II molds 15, 16 (Table I) . We have used this same grouping to look at the occurrence of molds in this study of patients with CRS and compared the results with findings in a group of control patients.",

Numbers of spores or conidia detected in mucous brush samples (N) were calculated using the equation: log 10 (N) \u03ed (\u232cC T \u03ea a)/b, where \u232cC T was the difference in observed C T values between the target and reference organisms (C T,target \u03ea C T,reference ) for the respective mucous brush sample and \"a\" and \"b\" were the mean y-intercept and slope parameter values from the standard calibration curves for each target assay group. Parallel analyses of method negative control samples, containing AE buffer only, were performed at a frequency of approximately one per each six test samples analyzed. All positive results were confirmed by two additional replications.",

No individual species was significantly correlated with CRS. Therefore, molds were grouped as previously described (Table I) . 15, 16 Mold was detected 30 times in patients with CRS and 22 times in control subjects (Table IV) . Seven were members of the group I molds associated with water damage and were found in both the patients with CRS and the control subjects.

It could be argued that the fungal laboratory culture technique leads to contamination and that this is why the yields approach 100% in some studies. Yet, the fact that the early newborn cultures did not become positive over time argues strongly against laboratory contamination as an explanation for near 100% yields. Rather, it may be the collection technique itself that leads to specimens being contaminated at the outset. The high-yield culture studies use a nasal irrigation technique to collect mucous. 10, 12 A small amount of saline is irrigated into the nose for several seconds and then collected for laboratory processing. This irrigation technique likely samples the nasal vestibule, lower nasal mucosal surfaces of the inferior turbinate, and perhaps the nasopharynx and olfactory cleft. It is rather indiscriminate as to the specific origin of the washing irrigant. This present study reveals a fungal yield of approximately 45%. Our yield is similar to other QPCR techniques reported in the past. 13, 14, 26, 32, 33 However, the present study was specific to the mycology of the middle meatus because the samplings were obtained under direct endoscopic guidance. Two QPCR-based studies have shown higher fungal yields than revealed in this report, but one was obtained from surgical material and the other used an irrigation technique that was not specific to the middle meatus. 31, 35 Yet, when diseased and nondiseased patients are compared, no statistical difference is revealed between the presence or absence of fungus, the species of fungus, or the number of different fungi present.",

There are, however, certain disadvantages to the culture method. The culture method requires a week's worth of specialized laboratory processing and therefore results are not immediately available. In addition, to reveal the specific identification of the fungi found, QPCR methods may be necessary to finalize the specific genus and species of the growing fungal colonies. QPCR techniques are extraordinarily accurate because the identification is based on specific DNA coding. Therefore, accurate identification is essentially instantaneous. QPCR also avoids prolonged laboratory culturing and has the potential to reveal a quick result. Also, it does not appear that directed culture techniques can duplicate the yields found in irrigation methods of sampling as evidenced by our results. In fact, the directed culture techniques seem to have a yield lower than the QPCR-based methods that show a yield of approximately 40% to 60%. 13, 14, 22, 28 It is possible that the irrigation techniques are too indiscriminate to provide accurate information on the mycology of the middle meatus or of a specific nasal region.",

No statistical difference can be ascribed to the presence or type of fungi to help differentiate between these two groups. Consideration of grouping fungi into categories may help to definitively determine whether or not specific molds are in fact related to sinus disease.",
