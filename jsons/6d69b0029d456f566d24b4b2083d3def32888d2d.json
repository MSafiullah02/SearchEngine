            "text": "Given the utmost priority of COVID-19 research, many medical journals, especially the leading ones, expedited the review process of these papers. It was expected that the amount of submitted papers for peer review would raise sharply and the deadline of the review period at the COVID-19 outbreak will be tightened. Therefore, sample size calculation of these papers, a component that was being omitted in more than 40% of the published randomized controlled trials, 1 might be neglected during the peer review process. Most importantly, authors of these papers were also rushing to conduct their COVID-19 research and they might not have seek necessary statistical consultation regarding sample size calculation. The CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement recommends trial reports to provide all essential information on the determination of sample size, including the level of statistical significance, the desired level of power, and the estimated effect size of the treatment. However, the degree of compliance to the CONSORT statement regarding sample size calculation of the newly-published COVID-19 trial papers is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed all clinical trials on COVID-19 patients published from 1 st January 2020 to 4 th April 2020 indexed in PubMed. We adopted the revised Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy 2 to search PubMed for papers reporting clinical trial involving COVID-19 patients, either randomized or nonrandomized, indexed by 4 th April 2020. The search term can be found in the supplementary material. A total of 521 papers were identified. Papers were excluded when they were 1) case studies or case series (n=25), 2) commentaries, editorials, or letters to the editor (n=189), 3) guidelines (n=61), 4) observational studies (n=108), 5) reviews (n=69), 6) studies on the virus instead of the patients (n=15), and 7) not about COVID-19 (n=50). Finally, four studies were included in this study. Details of these papers and the reason of exclusion are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . The following information, together with the relevant texts in the papers, were extracted: 1) whether the group allocation of patients was randomized, 2) the measurement type of the primary outcome that the sample size calculation based on, 3) the level of significance used, 4) the desired power, and 5) the estimated effect size and the relevant statistics to calculate this effect size.",

However, some information for calculating the treatment effect size were missing in these two papers. Zhou et al. (2020) 7 stated that \"detecting a reduction of 40% in SOFA scores between the treatment and nontreatment groups\", 7 however the SOFA (or the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score is a continuous variable. To calculate the sample P a g e | 4 size, the post-treatment between-group mean difference and the pooled standard deviation of the primary outcome variable, or the Cohen\"s d effect size which equals the between-group mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation, should be estimated. The sample size of 23 per group as stated by the authors (\"Considering a dropout rate of 5%, the sample size is estimated to be 24 cases in each group\") implied that they estimated the Cohen\"s d to the viral load at day 7\" 4 ) but the effect of the control group was missing. Note that if we assume the effect of the control group is 0%, which is a common assumption in effect size estimation, the required sample size calculated using Fleiss\" formula 8 would be (z 0.025 \u221a (2(p 1+ p 2 ) (p 1 -p 2 ))) + z 0.2 \u221a (p 1 (1-p 1 )+p 2 (1-p 2 ))) 2 /(p 1 -p 2 ) 2 = (1.96 \u221a (2(0.5)(0.25))) + 0.84 \u221a (0.5(1-0.5)) 2 /(0.5) 2 = 12 per group, and the required sample size using Fleiss\" formula with continuity correction 8 would be n(1+ \u221a (1+4/n(p 1 -p 2 ))) 2 /4 = 12(1+ \u221a (1+4/12(0.5))) 2 /4 = 16 per group. The authors, claiming that Fleiss\" formula with continuity correction was used, calculated that 21 subjects per group were required (\"assume \u202610% loss to follow-up, we calculated that a total of 48 COVID-19 patients (ie, 24 cases in the hydroxychloroquine group and 24 in the control group) would be required for the analysis (Fleiss with CC)\" 4 ), which implied that they assumed the effect of the control group would be around 5%, i.e., 1 out of the 24 in the control group would achieve a viral load clearance. This assumption deviated with the usual assumption that the control group has no effect, and the authors should have specify this assumption in the main text.",
