Such information includes the factors of health and environment risk itself and policy decisions for controlling and managing those risks. Due to increasing complexities of risks embedded in modern society (Beck 1992), risk control and management have become interactive and mutual efforts of multiple organizations. Particularly, a response to an extreme event requires joint efforts between the direct interested parties and others regardless of the fact that their information and communication channels are under the usual chain of communication (Doerfel, 2016; Dynes & Quarantelli, 1976; Quarantelli, 1997) . Communication between these organizations enables them to collaboratively assess their common problems, and it is also essential for them to take the required actions in preparing for the emergencies brought on by the extreme event, not to mention for recovery from devastation (Comfort, 2005; Comfort 2007; Ganor and Ben\u2010Lavy 2003; Prezelj, 2015).",

Conversely, a lack of communication or the absence of accurate information exchange between disaster response organizations results in a lack of coordination among them (Celik & Corbacioglu, 2010; Eikenberry, Arroyave, & Cooper, 2007; Kapucu & Van Wart, 2006). For instance, during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, insufficient communication between the US Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief organizations created confusion in the coordination of relief efforts to meet the victims\u2019 needs immediately (Eikenberry et al., 2007). In contrast, effective interorganizational communication helps organizations survive after a disaster. When nonprofit and business organizations communicated with other related organizations after Hurricane Katrina, the focal organizations were able to gain support from their partner organizations in recovering from devastation (Doerfel, Lai, & Chewning, 2010).",

Governmental agencies would be unable to protect their country's residents from such a virus outbreak without securing crucial information about the nature of the infectious disease and the contagion path (Ansell, Boin, & Keller, 2010). High mobility of residents across jurisdictions deepens the interdependence between agencies in vertical and horizontal relationships in such an outbreak response. Even though governmental officials may have an understanding about the nature of the disease, they may not know the accurate path of the disease transmission without relying on information from other public organizations, which may occasionally be in foreign jurisdictions. Thus, governmental agencies have an immediate need to develop communicative resilience to improve interorganizational risk communication and gain essential information about the impending public health or environmental hazards. This, in turn, would enable them to respond better to an outbreak in their regional or local areas. As building a resilient network infrastructure is important for the uninterrupted provision of communication services and data processing for users (Smith et al., 2011), governmental agencies must have the capability to adapt communication actions with other agencies in a virus outbreak situation.",

Moreover, it proposes and tests two hypotheses about managerial strategies to improve resilience in interorganizational risk communication. The case used for this study is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) outbreak that occurred in South Korea in 2015. Many South Korean governmental agencies suffered from a lack of risk information regarding the nature of the infectious disease and contagion path when responding to the outbreak. The governmental agencies strived to obtain risk information from other agencies because of the transregional nature of the outbreak. However, they failed to get risk information shared by the national public health authority in the initial response period due to their incomplete provision of up\u2010to\u2010date information. We believe this study will enhance understanding about the manner in which governmental agencies build resilience in interorganizational risk communication during an outbreak response. Current literature highlights the importance of strategic management of emergency response networks (e.g., Choi & Brower, 2006; Demiroz, Kapucu, & Dodson, 2013; Hu, Knox, & Kapucu, 2014; Jung & Song, 2015; Jung, Song, & Feiock, 2017) and interorganizational risk communication in responses to virus outbreaks with a transboundary nature (Ansell et al., 2010). However, the existing research does not provide a systematic understanding about managerial strategies to build a resilient communication network with other organizations during a virus outbreak response. To bridge the gaps in the literature, this study examines several hypotheses to investigate the managerial strategies that governmental agencies can take to build a resilient communication network during an outbreak response.",

High mobility has facilitated the transmission of viruses between people who live in various administrative jurisdictions, thereby deepening the interconnectedness of governmental and nongovernmental organizations in an outbreak response.

As many communities that have experienced extreme events have not smoothly recovered from them, research has moved its focus on resilience instead (Boin, Comfort, & Demchak, 2010). In addition, the issue of reliance has caught the attention of researchers because it has little to do with preparedness and preventive measures for natural and man\u2010made disasters. Reports from the Community & Regional Resilience Institute have constantly highlighted that the ability to bounce back implies the systems\u2019 capacity to preserve its primary function from external disturbance; however, maintaining primary function has little to do with being prepared and having in place preventive measures (Rose, 2009). Instead, the concept of resilience lies mainly in the form of \u201cachievement of positive adaptation\u201d after \u201cexposure to threat or stress.\u201d (Bakker, Raab, & Milward, 2012; Brunner, 1994; Ireni\u2010Saban, 2012; Quick & Feldman, 2014) In a catastrophic event, resilient communities or organizations not only withstand the negative consequences of disaster and return to their normal states (Aldrich 2012) but also adapt their existing skills and resources to the new conditions (Comfort, 1999, p. 21). Therefore, resilience is considered to be a response system that is tested after a newly developed and developing situation.",

(2008) provided four dimensions of community resilience: economic equity, social capital, information and communication, and community competency. Communities with equitable distribution of resources among members and high levels of social capital (i.e., linkage and sense of community, active information sharing among members, and competency to collaborate together) have a strong ability to bounce back from an extreme event and adapt to the new circumstances. In addition, Bruneau et al. (2003) argued that there are four dimensions of resilience that are applicable to communities and organizations: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Communities or organizations can respond better to an extreme event by improving their ability to withstand a stress without losing their primary functions, ensuring substitutable elements of operation, mobilizing resources to achieve desirable goals, and meeting needs in a timely manner. From a communication perspective, organizations can improve their ability to bounce back from an extreme event and adapt their actions to the devastated circumstances by establishing multiple channels of cooperation and ensuring an overlap in information sources. In other words, redundancy in a risk communication network will secure robustness in the communication network structure, which in turn will highly guarantee that the necessary crucial information is not missed.",

In the case of an emergency, principal organizations in the emergency response system should be able to access the crucial information that describes the nature of the problem accurately to respond to the needs immediately (Comfort, Ko, & Zagorecki, 2004). For instance, to address the response needs of a virus outbreak, governmental organizations should have the essential information to manage uncertainty regarding the nature of the outbreak and the contagion path (Ansell et al., 2010; Olsson 2015). For local agencies, however, the situation may put them in greater uncertainty. While local agencies receive information from regional or national agencies (Park, Barnett, & Kim, 2004; Park, Kim, & Barnett, 2004), the transmitted risk information may be incomplete or may be disseminated with belated information in the first place. Because the higher level governmental organizations also depend on numerous local agencies, the latter would seek to find redundant or reciprocal ties with other agencies to build resilience in their risk communication network so as not to miss critical information.",

The organizations that seek reliable sources of information tend to use a close\u2010knit structure in communicating timely information. (Uzzi, 1997). A cohesive structure helps organizations to avoid the narrow pursuit of individual interests, enrich relationships through trust, and promote the pooling of resources, cooperation, and adaption to unexpected circumstances. Close\u2010knit relationships mobilize solidarity and provide social and psychological support for low\u2010performing members (Putnam, 2000).",

The close relationships can help forge a bond for the sharing of timely information during an unexpected crisis and a willingness to share responsibilities. Emergency response organizations often establish such linkages to make use of local knowledge and experience and to gain associational benefits. These actions foster trust between organizations and, thus, develop communication strategies to address the impact of a crisis (Pfefferbaum, Reissman, Pfefferbaum, Klomp, & Gurwitch, 2007). In a similar vein, Doerfel et al. (2010) demonstrated how closed\u2010knit communication structures are important for emergency responses. After Hurricane Katrina, private business owners and leaders of nonprofit organizations in New Orleans communicated with other organizations through personal or professional ties, and their own organizations were able to gain resources and support from the other organizations that were critical for adapting to the devastated situations and for organizational survival.",

This is because reciprocal risk communication can facilitate the circulation of timely information through the development of a relationship of trust between two organizations (Kenis & Knoke, 2002). In addition, a redundant communication tie will help organizations obtain better quality of information and respond to dynamic circumstances in a timely manner. An emergency response agency can access the crucial information needed to address public health or environmental risks and adapt to any failure of the main information channel through the redundant tie. Thus, we hypothesize that\nH\n1.

In the summer of 2015, South Korea suffered from an outbreak of MERS, which is caused by a virus called MERS Coronavirus (CDC, 2015). The virus is transmitted among people through close contact, and it affects respiratory systems that include lungs and breathing tubes. The common symptoms of MERS patients include severe shortness of breath, fever, and cough. Thirty or forty per cent of the patients tend to die. After the disease was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, other cases were identified in nearby countries. The first MERS patient in South Korea was identified on 20 May 2015, when a man aged 76 years visited four hospitals 7 days after his return from the Middle East (Ministry of Health & Welfare 2015a). His symptoms at the fourth hospital were reported to the South Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national disease control agency. Upon investigation, the South Korean government isolated the patient's family members and 64 clinicians. The quarantine range was, however, not comprehensive enough to cover all those who had contact with the first patient (the National Assembly Special Committee 2015). This failure of the initial government response led to the transmission of the infectious disease from the untargeted people to other hospital patients and visitors.",

The rationale for this coding lies in the fact that first, in an emergency situation, organizations at a higher position of a government's hierarchical structure tend to send information as an announcement or notice rather than as direct communication; it is often up to the organizations lower in the hierarchy to decide whether the information received is regarded as useful. Second, those mismatches fit into the purpose of this study, which is to reveal how organizations obtain information from multiple sources in a mass emergency by maintaining their communication network. Among these multiple sources, information from some organizations would weigh more than others even though it may not be in the form of direct communication.

ERGM allows researchers to specify a model of network generation in a flexible manner and accommodate a wide range of theories (Desmarais & Cranmer, 2012). ERGM models recognize complex dependencies among network ties, which violate the assumption of standard regression models, in predicting the formation of these ties (Robins, Lewis, & Wang, 2012). The modelling procedure will help examine the effects of dependencies among network ties and of attributes on the formation of interagency communication ties. The ERGM analysis is then conducted with R package statnet, an ERGM modelling package (Handcock et al. 2016). Our model converged in three iterations, and the log\u2010likelihood iteration improved through three iterations. We checked for the model's goodness of fit by simulating a large number of networks based on the estimated coefficients (see Appendix Figure A1).",

As we have indicated earlier in the E\u2010I index, ties within the communication network are mostly connected to organizations in other group categories. This provides a hint that the density of the network within and between organizational groups will identify the information flow and allow a further understanding of the direction of the GWESP structure. This implies that the density of the network in terms of organizational groups will show whether the direction of information flow with the GWESP tends to stream between higher level governments and lower level governmental agencies or between same levels of governments.
