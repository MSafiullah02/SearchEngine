The diagnosis of diarrhea was made by veterinarians. Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in sterile plastic bottles and submitted on the day of sampling to the laboratory by express mail. Submitted samples were accompanied by a record sheet containing information on the size of herd, number of scouring calves and number of calves ( < 30 days) in the herd at sampling time, and age of each sampled calf. Only fecal samples obtained within 48 h of onset of clinical signs from non-treated calves up to 30 days of age were included in this study. Samples were processed within 24 h of reception.",

After overnight incubation, four colonies with the typical appearance of E. coli from each sample were randomly chosen. E. coli strains were identified by biochemical tests. The strains were tested for F5 fimbriae by the slide agglutination method with live bacteria grown on Minca-Isovitalex solid media. The production of absorbed antiserum used to detect this fimbrial antigen has been described (Morris et al., 1983; Contrepois et al., 1985). Salmonella species were isolated by enrichment of faeces in selective broths. Approximately 1 g of faeces was added both to 9 ml of tetrathionate broth and to 7.5 ml of selenite broth. After 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, samples were plated out on brilliant green agar, and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Lactose-negative colonies were tested on triple sugar iron, urea, and o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside media.

Nevertheless, broadly similar high detection rate of Cryptosporidium infection (37.3%) in 0\u20137-day-old diarrheic calves was found by Fagan et al. (1995)in Ireland. On the other hand, very different results have been reported in prevalence surveys. Thus, in a survey carried out in Arag\u00f3n (Spain), Qu\u00edlez et al. (1996) found as much as 44.4% of calves aged 3\u20134 days infected with Cryptosporidium, while in a nation-wide survey performed in USA only 2.5% of < 4 days old calves were positive to Cryptosporidium (Garber et al., 1994). Two to 4 days are typically required for the first shedding of oocysts in feces. Therefore, the high detection rate found by us in age group 1\u20137 days indicates that most of these calves were infected immediately after birth, and that the environment was heavily contaminated with oocysts.",

That is in accordance with the age-dependent susceptibility of calves to the other enteropathogens considered except Salmonella. The pathogenic significance of concurrent infections in diarrheic calves, however, is not yet clear. Whether additive or synergistic interactions, that give rise to clinical effect or increase the severity of disease, occur in calves infected with Cryptosporidium and any other agent, or whether other agents extend the risk period for clinical cryptosporidiosis remain to be proved experimentally. Nevertheless, in microbiological surveys of diarrheic and healthy neonatal calves, mixed infections were much more commonly detected in diarrheic than in healthy calves (Morin et al., 1980; Reynolds et al., 1986). Reynolds et al. (1986)suggested that the presence of more than one enteropathogen may be one of the factors determining whether an infection results in a clinical or subclinical effect. Moreover, mixed infections have been associated with more severe disease (Morin et al., 1980).",
