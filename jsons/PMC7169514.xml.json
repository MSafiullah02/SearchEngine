Secretory IgA (sIgA) is well\u2010known to be transported across epithelial cells into the lumen through an active unidirectional receptor\u2010mediated process known as transcytosis by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) [6]. Conversely, the mechanisms by which IgG reaches the luminal intestinal secretions in adult mice are not entirely established. IgG is thought to enter various external secretions by receptor\u2010independent paracellular diffusion, receptor (FcRn)\u2010mediated transepithelial transport, and fluid\u2010phase endocytosis depending on the tissue involved [1]. Based on the relative proportions of the IgG subclasses as well as the ratio of specific versus total IgG detected in external secretions and plasma, it has been assumed that the presence of IgG antibodies in external mucosal secretions is originated exclusively or predominantly from the circulation through transudation [33, 34]. However, a few studies have shown evidence suggesting that the source of IgG found in secretions might arise from local mucosal production. For example, it has been demonstrated that the specificity of IgG Abs in secretions may differ from that of their serum counterparts and vary depending on the mucosal compartment [35]. Moreover, female genital tract secretions contain a significant proportion of IgG, which seems to be locally produced by abundant IgG\u2010producing cells [33]. Likewise, present results indicate that in the intestinal lamina propria of the small and large intestine, of Cry1Ac immunized mice are induced significant specific IgG\u2010producing cell responses. Although the number of IgG\u2010producing cells was not higher than those producing other isotypes, they appear to produce a greater amount of antibody.",

After a virulent enteric coronavirus challenge [37], smaller numbers of IgA ASC and larger numbers of IgG ASC were observed in the intestines of pigs. It has been demonstrated that specific mucosal IgG responses can be induced (in extracts obtained from various effectors sites: the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, salivary glands, and uterus\u2010vagina) by adjuvant\u2010free parenteral immunization with soluble antigens [38].

However, the possibility that part of the high IgG responses found in intestinal secretions might have come from the serum as a result of an intestinal inflammatory reaction provoked by immunization, could not be excluded. Thus, we considered important to determine if the immunization provoked intestinal inflammation as well as to evaluate the presence of intestinal IgG+ lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. We did not find any evidence of an inflammatory reaction or tissue damage upon histological examination of the intestines of immunized mice. While the immunohistochemical examination confirmed, the presence of IgG+ lymphocytes located in the lamina propria of both, the small and large intestines, of control and immunized. Interestingly, we also observed that some epithelial cells displayed IgG staining, (at both the apical and basal regions), suggesting that IgG was being transported through these cells instead of being delivered to the lumen either by intercellular transudation or by the leakage of tight junctions that could be provoked by an immunization\u2010induced inflammatory reaction.

However, the evidence showing that FcRn is not expressed in the intestinal epithelia of adult mice [7, 10] had suggested that this receptor only participate in intestinal IgG transport in neonatal mice, while in adult rodents, this transport was not mediated by this receptor. However, it has not been examined before whether FcRn was expressed in intestinal epithelia upon intestinal IgG induction. Importantly, present results indicate that the expression of this receptor can be reactivated to some extent in adult mice. Although the expression of FcRn achieved following immunization with Cry in adult mice was substantially inferior in comparison with that found in neonatal intestines, probably FcRn might facilitate epithelial IgG transport in the intestine of adult mice exhibiting intestinal IgG responses, since immunized mice also showed increased numbers of epithelial cells containing IgG.",

However, when the effect of stimulation with Cry1Ac was tested in vitro in isolated epithelial intestinal cells, we found an increase on FcRn expression (after 24 h), suggesting that the protein might also exerts direct effects in intestinal mammalian epithelial cells, perhaps throughout an unknown receptor as has been previously suggested. Indeed, despite Cry proteins are not toxic for vertebrates and Cry1Ac toxin is known to form pores exclusively in lepidopteran insect larvae midgut epithelial cells, it has been shown that Cry1Ac protoxin binds to brush border membranes vesicles prepared from mouse small intestine in vitro, and induces a transient hyperpolarization of the jejunum [41]. Although, the nature of the interacting molecules with Cry proteins in mammalian enterocytes seems to be different to the receptor glycoproteins described in insects, like the 120 kDa aminopeptidase N [18] and the 210 kDa cadherin\u2010like glycoprotein (Bt\u2010R1) [42], since binding was not inhibited by the GalNAc, mannose or biotin.",

This study topic is important since like IgA, mucosally associated IgG has been shown to contribute importantly to mucosal host defense [3, 9]. Indeed some reports have also shown that passive administration of neutralizing IgGs can prevent mucosal human immunodeficiency virus transmission in rhesus macaques or macaque neonates [3]. Likewise, virus\u2010specific IgG in vaginal secretions of immune mice significantly reduces infection of the vaginal epithelium by challenge with herpes simplex virus type 2, whereas S\u2010IgA contributes relatively little to this protection. Moreover, it has been proposed that FcRn regulates mucosal IgG immune responses to luminal bacteria, as selective expression of FcRn in the epithelium, (using a transgenic mice model expressing FcRn beyond the neonatal period of life), was shown to be associated with secretion of IgG into the lumen that allows for defense against an epithelium\u2010associated pathogen (Citrobacter rodentium) [9].",
