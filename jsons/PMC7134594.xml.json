Upon the emergence of this syndrome, international response was quick to identify and characterize its causative agent as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The reemergence of SARS in the Guangdong province of China in December 2003 [8] and the spring of 2004 [9], while not necessarily indicative of another global outbreak, illustrates the need to continue efforts to study this virus and develop appropriate therapeutics for its treatment.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus whose genome is predominated by two open reading frames that are connected by a ribosomal frameshift site and that encode the two replicase proteins, pp1a and pp1ab 10, 11. These polyproteins are cleaved by the main proteinase 3CLpro\n[11] (also called Mpro\n12, 13) in the first step of the formation of the crucial replication-transcription complex. The activity of 3CLpro, so named for its similarity to 3C proteinases of Picornaviridae\n[14], is an attractive target for the development of therapeutics against SARS due to its fundamental role in viral replication. Homology modeling with other 3CLpro's 12, 15, X-ray crystallography [13], and a recent mutagenesis study [16] have identified 3CLpro as a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad in the active site. Structure-based sequence alignments of pp1a and pp1ab of SARS-CoV with the equivalent polyproteins from human coronavirus 229E (HCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have identified the consensus sequence for proteolysis as (S, T, V, P, A)-(L, I, V, F, M)-Q/(A, S, G, N, C) [12]. In vitro studies have confirmed the ability of 3CLpro to process sites of this type, and that the proteinase has the highest specificity for the cleavage sites flanking 3CLpro in the pp1a/pp1ab polyprotein 11, 17.",

Compounds identified as potential inhibitors of 3CLpro from these studies include the HIV-1 protease inhibitor L-700,417 [15], the reverse transcriptase inhibitors calanolide A and nevirapine [20], glycovir, an \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor [20], sabadinine, a natural product [21], and the general antiviral ribavirin [20] . Ribavirin has been shown to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro, but at concentrations that are cytotoxic [23]. At the onset of the initial SARS outbreak, this compound was used as a first-line defense both as a monotherapy [24] and in combination with corticosteroids [25] or Kaletra (an approved HIV protease inhibitor) [24]; however, it is now generally believed that ribavirin is not an effective treatment for SARS (26, 27 and references therein). At the time of writing, it is not known whether the other compounds identified through virtual means have yet been tested with 3CLpro or SARS-CoV to evaluate their actual inhibitory capabilities.",

Additionally, in vitro screening campaigns illustrate that out of over 500 existing protease inhibitors, only two were identified as active toward 3CLpro. These findings illustrate the need to look toward the development of innovative inhibitors for this protease. One such study has recently identified unique keto-glutamine analogs as inhibitors of 3CLpro with IC50's in the low micromolar range (J.C. Vederas, submitted). In an effort to advance this initiative, we sought to identify novel small molecules that specifically target 3CLpro. In this paper, we describe the cloning, expression, and purification of 3CLpro from the SARS-CoV Tor2 isolate, and subsequent screening campaign against a library of 50,000 small molecules. We herein report the finding of five novel inhibitors of 3CLpro.",

Ideally, such an assay would (1) work over a time scale of several minutes at most to facilitate the rapid evaluation of thousands of potential inhibitors; (2) be homogeneous for ease of automation; and (3) be sensitive to minimize background signal from the presence of the compounds tested. Quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays have become a common tool to monitor proteinase activity [30] and fulfill the necessary criteria for use in an efficient and robust high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign. The basis for such an assay is the modification of a peptide substrate to include a fluorescent label and quencher on opposing sides of the proteinase cleavage site (Figure 1)\n. Using this substrate, the activity of a proteinase can be measured directly without the need for additional steps to purify and/or characterize the products. This type of assay is also beneficial as it permits enzymatic reactions to be monitored in real time to obtain accurate reaction rates. This aspect of the quenched-FRET assay is particularly attractive since, in evaluating the activity of a proteinase in terms of a rate, the potential for false negatives to occur in the screen due to the presence of inherent fluorescence from the compounds being tested is reduced.",

In the analysis of kinetic data using the Abz-Tyr(NO2) substrate, the primary data were corrected for inner filter effect [31].

These so-called \u201cpromiscuous\u201d inhibitors likely form aggregates in solution that nonspecifically absorb or adsorb the target enzyme [39]. Only three compounds showed any marked reduction in enzyme inhibition in the presence of BSA, with the greatest effect being a decrease of only 20%; these compounds were removed from the prospective inhibitor pool.",

The thiol side chain of the active site cysteine of 3CLpro is necessarily a good nucleophile and therefore has the capacity to combine with a variety of electrophilic functionalities to form covalent adducts. This reaction is the basis for several classes of existing peptidic inhibitors of cysteine proteases which include \u03b1-\u03b2-unsaturated ketones, esters, and amides 40, 41 (Table 1, 1\u20134) and nitriles [42] (Table 1, 15). In addition, N-substituted maleimides (Table 1, 14) have long been recognized as being reactive toward thiols in general, and cysteine proteases in particular [43]. The two identified sulfur containing compounds (Table 1, 13) are also capable of forming disulfide linkages with the catalytic thiol of 3CLpro to inactivate the enzyme [44] The remaining carbonyl functionalities and corresponding nitrogen- and sulfur-containing analogs listed in Table 1, 5\u201312, may also have enough electrophilic character to promote the nucleophilic attack of the active site thiol of 3CLpro. Due to the potential inherent reactivity of the 69 candidate inhibitors, we sought to identify and eliminate those compounds whose high reactivity rendered them nonspecific toward the active site of 3CLpro by including 1,4-dithio-D,L-threitol (DTT) in the inhibition reaction. A reduction in the inhibition of 3CLpro by any candidate compound in the presence of DTT suggests that such a compound would probably react nonspecifically with any biologically available thiol functionality 40, 41. Although this renders such compounds as unlikely drug candidates, they may be useful in studying the active site architecture of 3CLpro. Of the remaining 69 candidate inhibitors, the inhibitory action of 5 of these was not significantly affected by the inclusion of 1 mM DTT; these were selected for further characterization.",

To evaluate the selectivity of each compound, we investigated their ability to inhibit four other proteinases with varying structural and mechanistic relatedness to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3Cpro, like all picornaviral 3Cpros, is similar in structure, mechanism, and substrate specificity to 3CLpro\n11, 14, 45. The Hepatitis C Nonstructural 3 proteinase (NS3pro) and chymotrypsin are serine proteases with the same two \u03b2-barrel fold as 3CLpro\n13, 46. Finally, papain is a paradigm cysteine proteinase with an active site Cys/His/Asp catalytic triad whose structural fold does not resemble that shared by chymotrypsin, NS3pro, 3CLpro, and 3Cpro. It was difficult in some cases to obtain a full dose-response curve for every inhibitor with each of the proteinases due to interfering compound fluorescence and/or compound insolubility under each of the assay conditions. In such cases, if the lack of data at higher compound concentrations precluded interpolation of a reliable IC50 value, the IC50 is reported as a lower limit (Table 2)\n. Alternatively, those compounds for which enzyme inhibition was not seen at the highest concentration tested, are indicated accordingly. It is important to note that in the absence of full mechanistic analyses, the IC50 values are intended to reveal profound differences in potency to provide insight into the selectivity of the inhibitors, and to aid in their prioritization as leads for continuing studies.",

MAC-5576 showed some selectivity toward those proteinases with a chymotrypsin-like fold, as it was seen to inhibit 3CLpro (IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM), HAV 3Cpro (IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM), and chymotrypsin (IC50 = 13 \u03bcM), although no effect was seen with NS3pro, which also shares this structural motif. Papain, which lacks this fold, was unaffected by MAC-5576. An important difference between 3CLpro and 3Cpro is that the coronaviral enzyme is only functionally active as a dimer whereas 3Cpro is active as a monomer in vitro. The interaction between the 3CLpro subunits is sufficiently weak that disrupting the dimerization interface has been proposed as a promising target for novel antiviral agents [32]. In view of the relatedness between 3CLpro and HAV 3Cpro, it is therefore likely that of the five secondary hits, those that are also active toward HAV 3Cpro do not interact with 3CLpro at its dimer interface, but at a site that is common to both proteinases.",

This study examined the inhibition of the isomerase by a series of substituted benzothiazoles, and indicated that MAC-8120 interacted with cysteine residues on the enzyme that were previously shown to be central in dimerization. This interaction, although as yet uncharacterized, was reported to perturb the contact interface of the subunits of the homodimer to inactivate the enzyme. It is therefore quite possible that MAC-8120 associates with the active site cysteine of 3CLpro in a similar manner to disrupt its catalytic activity. The exact mechanism of inhibition of 3CLpro by MAC-8120 and the remaining secondary hits requires further study and characterization in order to evaluate their potential to act as leads for the development of novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV, and potentially, other picornaviral-like proteinases.

The expression vector was derived from pT7HP20, a derivative of pT7-7 [49] containing an approximately 300 bp XbaI/HindIII fragment from pLEHP20 [51]. A plasmid containing the coding sequence of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was a generous gift from Genome Sciences Centre (Vancouver, BC, Canada). The gene encoding 3CLpro was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: SPH (5\u2032-CCCAGCTAGCGGTTTTAGGAAAATGGCATTC-3\u2032) and 3SP (5\u2032-TACGAAGCTTGTCGACTTATTGGAAGGTAACACCAGAGCA-3\u2032). SPH introduces an NheI site (underlined) at the beginning of the gene and 3SP introduces a HindIII site (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface) at the end of the coding sequence. The PCR reaction was performed using the Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase system (Roche Applied Sciences, Laval, PQ, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions using an annealing temperature of 50\u00b0C. The resulting amplicon was digested with NheI and HindIII and cloned in pT7HP20 yielding the expression plasmid pT7HSP1. The cloned gene was sequenced using an ABI 373 Strech (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Big-Dye terminators to verify its authenticity. The amplified gene and the original clone had a deletion (corresponding to guanine at position 32 of the coding sequence). The mutation was repaired in pT7HSP1 using a convenient BsmI site. Accordingly, the oligonucleotide S3CDM (5\u2032-GAAAATGGCATTCCCGTCAGGCAAAGTTGAAGG-3\u2032) contains the BsmI restriction site (underlined) and the missing nucleotide (boldface). A second PCR reaction was performed using S3CDM and 3SP and Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's conditions, using an annealing temperature of 50\u00b0C. The resulting amplicon was digested using BsmI and HindIII, and was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pT7HSP1. This yielded pT7HSP2, whose nucleotide sequence was confirmed as described above.",
