A phage particle consists of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome. The phage surface has 3-5 copies of phage coat protein-3 (pIII), which is involved in host cell recognition and infection. The major coat protein is phage coat protein-8 (pVIII), which covers the length of the particle with approximately 2,700 copies that contribute to the structural stability of the phage particle (Russel, 1991) . Thus, phagemid combines the characteristics of a plasmid (antibiotic resistance and facilitation of replication of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)) with those of a phage (production and packaging of ssDNA into a phage particle). Light chain and Fd region genes are cloned into appropriate sites. Secretion signal sequences (e.g. pelB, ompA or PhoA) are coupled to both genes, which allow secretion of Fd and light chain fragments into the periplasm fraction of E. coli.

Here, we have shown that bypassing the phage display and panning processes is practical when immunoglobulin genes are derived from seropositive donors. Identification of bacterial colonies using membrane filters and donor plasma is useful for the initial screening of human Fab fragments to major antigenic molecules of pathogens. Preparation of immunoglobulin gene libraries from EB virus-transformed oligoclonal B-LCL can also be used for preparation of human Fab fragments to pathogens and self-antigens. Recently, a new technique bypassing the phage display platform has also been developed. B cells are cultured at near clonal density, culture supernatants are screened, and positives are used to clone authentic antibody genes (Walker et al., 2009) .

Positive clones are selected extracted from the cells. The immunoglobulin genes encoding the Fab fragments are amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector. The vector is transformed into E. coli and each colony is picked up and incubated for expression of Fab fragments.
