Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37-year-old asthmatic man, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID-19 less than two weeks after presentation to the hospital. His lungs showed mucus plugging and other histologic changes attributable to asthma, as well as early diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and a fibrinous pneumonia. The presence of DAD is similar to descriptions of autopsy lung findings from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and the absence of a neutrophil-rich acute bronchopneumonia differs from the histologic changes typical of influenza. The relative contribution of mucus plugging to his hypoxemia is unknown.",

While most patients experience mild symptoms, 5% of patients suffer catastrophic respiratory failure and of those, approximately half die of disease. 2, 3 In Chinese populations, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are the most commonly reported comorbidities and are associated with worse survival. [4] [5] [6] [7] Early data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed similar findings, and also identified underlying lung disease as a risk factor in the United States (US). Nearly 10% of US COVID-19 patients have chronic lung disease, including asthma, as a risk factor. 8 In contrast, only 2% of cases in Chinese studies had chronic lung disease.

He later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His past medical history was most significant for asthma, managed with ipratropium bromide and albuterol inhaler, and type II diabetes on sitagliptin. On admission, computed tomography of the chest showed multifocal groundglass opacities. Treatment included hydroxychloroquine, empiric piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, and corticosteroids. He suffered worsening hypoxemia, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation on hospital day (HD) 4, and met the Berlin criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 9 On HD 9, he suffered sudden decompensation in oxygenation followed by cardiogenic collapse, prompting transition to venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Continuous renal replacement therapy was also initiated, but his severe lactic acidosis was unrelenting. Care was withdrawn on HD 9 and an autopsy was requested.",

Despite the presence of mucus plugs, there was no evidence of hyperinflation/air-trapping, the anticipated finding in patients who die of status asthmaticus. 10 Histologic sections of the proximal airways corroborated the presence of paucicellular mucus plugs, but without tissue eosinophilia. Goblet cell metaplasia, mucus gland hyperplasia, and thickening of subepithelial basement membranes in cartilaginous and non-cartilaginous airways attested to the patient's history of asthma. The distal alveolated lung tissue showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), characterized by patchy, mild interstitial thickening by edema, focal pneumocyte hyperplasia, and scattered hyaline membranes, the histologic hallmark of DAD ( Figure 2 ). Rare fibrin thrombi were also identified within small vessels and a small muscular pulmonary artery consistent with endothelial injury. This was accompanied by a mild patchy fibrinous airspace exudate in which mononuclear inflammatory cells predominated with scattered neutrophils (Figure 3 ). While the inflammatory infiltrate was limited to distal airspaces without involvement of bronchi or bronchioles, this finding was morphologically similar to previous descriptions of COVID-19 pneumonia and may represent early bronchopneumonia. [11] [12] [13] Discussion DAD with a patchy fibrinous airspace exudate is the predominant finding in COVID-19associated ARDS. The findings are histologically typical, including epithelial necrosis targeting the distal pulmonary acinus, endothelial injury with associated fibrin thrombi in small vessels, hyperplasia of reparative type 2 pneumocytes that lack viral inclusions, and hyaline membranes. 14 Ours is among the earliest descriptions of pulmonary histologic changes in patients who die within weeks of symptom onset. Two previous reports also described DAD in COVID-19 patients with premortem diagnoses of ARDS. 12, 13 DAD was also a consistent autopsy finding in patients from the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and",
