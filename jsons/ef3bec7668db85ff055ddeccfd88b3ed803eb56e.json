This outbreak aroused great global concerns, due to it being the first time in recent decades that an AIV has caused multiple human severe infections in a wide region during a short period. It is highly desired to timely reveal the epidemiological features and risk of the outbreak [1\uf02d3] .

Of the first 91 cases, only two pairs were from the same families, and no sound evidences supported human-to-human transmission between them. Among the total of 1108 close contacts of the first cases reported online, only two (namely the two in the two pairs from the same families) were identified as H7N9 cases. All these data suggest that the virus could not transmit among humans. This further suggests that most of the first 91 cases were infected with the virus from infected animals.",

In general, the severity of an infectious disease outbreak is dynamic, and it may be rated higher or lower when more characteristics of the outbreak are revealed or changed [8] .

However, influenza pandemics caused by different virus strains may be of different severity [13] . The H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 was mild mainly because seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses had widely circulated in humans for decades before the pandemic, which resulted in some immunity in humans against the novel pandemic H1N1 virus, especially in the elderly (so their infections were much fewer, as showed by Figure 1 ). In contrast, H7 subtype influenza virus has never widely circulated in humans, and thus persons of all ages are likely susceptible to the virus infection. Therefore, the future possible H7N9 pandemic will be likely more severe than the pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009.",

However, such a mild scenario of the outbreak evolution is of less possibility than the very or extremely severe scenario describe above. The main reason is that some random mutations leading to the improved adaption of the virus to humans will emerge naturally during its long existence in humans, as the virus usually evolves rapidly. These mutants will become dominant by natural selection as they are more adaptive in humans. They thus may spread in humans rapidly and can spark a deadly pandemic.

Another ideal scenario is that the virus was generated in live bird markets, and it has not spread to many poultry farms, and it will not spread to many poultry farms, and it will disappear with closure of live bird markets in related regions. We assume that some parts rather than the whole ideal scenario are possible. The future real status may be between the worst and the best scenarios given above.
