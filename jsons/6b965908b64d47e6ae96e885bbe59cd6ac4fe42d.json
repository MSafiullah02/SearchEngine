Furthermore, STING has recently emerged as an exciting target for both immunological conditions (i.e. STING inhibition) and oncology (i.e. STING activation) [5] . STING's role in the immune system is consistent with its higher expression in the thymus, heart, spleen, placenta, lung and peripheral leukocytes. While induction of type I IFNs is the major outcome of STING activation in vertebrates, it has recently become clear that STING evolved more than 600 million years ago, predating the evolution of type I IFNs [6, 7] . Except the induction of type I IFNs, several studies unraveled that the induction of autophagy process is a primordial function of the cGAS-STING pathway [8e10] . In addition, cGAS and STING are subject to extensive regulation by posttranslational modifications and interactions with other proteins and metal ions, indicating the importance of precise regulation of this pathway [6] .",

            "text": "Human cGAS is identified as a broad-specificity cytosolic DNA sensor which is atypical among innate immune sensors in being both receptor and biosynthetic enzyme [11e13] . cGAS binds dsDNA through its phosphate backbone, therefore making the binding nonsequence dependent [11] . Then the active site of cGAS rearranges and becomes competent to convert adenosine 5 0 -triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine 5 0 -triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphateeadenosine monophosphate (cGAMP). The produced endogenous cGAMP ligand in turn activate STING on the ER membrane ( Fig. 1) [13e15]. The ability of a single molecule of cGAS to produce multiple molecules of cGAMP provides a mechanism by which detection of a small amount of cytosolic dsDNA can produce a rapidly amplified antiviral signaling response. Besides cGAMP-mediated activation, STING can be activated directly by bacteria-derived cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) [16] . Thus, CDNs are both endogenous and pathogen-derived potent activators of the STING pathway, and as such, they function as ubiquitous second messengers in prokaryotic species and eukaryotes [17] .",

            "text": "Upon cGAMP binding, STING translocates from ER to the Golgi via ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) . Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in turn phosphorylates STING, leading to recruitment of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). TBK1 then phosphorylates IRF3 in a STING-dependent manner, resulting in the IRF3 dimerization and the translocation to the nucleus, where IRF3 then mediates transcription of IFN-b and other coregulated genes [4, 18] . In addition to their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, IFN-b also promotes the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells and thereby links innate immune responses to adaptive immune responses. Meanwhile, the binding of IFN-b to its receptor activates Janus kinases (JAKs), including JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which in turn phosphorylates the receptor. This process allows the binding of the DNA-binding proteins signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2) to the receptor, whereupon they become phosphorylated and dimeric. Then the dimer translocates to the nucleus, where it up-regulates transcription of interferon-response genes, including interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) edependent transcription of type I IFNs. The synthesis and release of IFNs and their binding to interferon receptor further up-regulate STING and the transcription of other proinflammatory cytokine genes in a positive feedback loop [19] . The cGAS-STING signaling cascade also functions across neighboring cells via gap-junction communication and may connect more distant cell types or tissues through the packaging of cGAMP in viral particles ( Fig. 1 ) [20] .",

LSm14A (protein LSm14 homolog A), a member of the LSm (Sm-like protein) family involved in RNA processing in the processing bodies, plays an important role in maintaining the mature mRNA level of STING in a cell typeespecific manner [22] . Meanwhile, after activation and trafficking, STING is phosphorylated by serine/threonine-protein kinase 1/autophagy-related protein 1 (ULK1/ATG1) triggered by cGAS-generated CDNs in order to suppress IRF3 activation. Therefore, CDNs may also initiate a negative-feedback control mechanism to thwart prolonged innate immune gene transcription and to prevent inflammatory disorders [23] . Autophagy-related protein 9a (ATG9a) restricts STING translocation from the Golgi apparatus and regulates the assembly of STING and TBK1 [24] . NOD-like receptor C3 (NLRC3) associates with STING and prevents its trafficking from the ER to Golgi [25] , resulting in reducing the response of type I IFNs. While the Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 1 (ZDHHC1), a member of the aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine palmitoyl acyltransferase family, associates with STING in the ER and Golgi apparatus after viral DNA stimulation and positively modulates STING activity, leading to increased TBK1-IRF3 engagement and type I IFNs production [26] . UBX domain-containing protein 3B (UBXN3B) complexes with STING and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM56 to positively regulate STING-dependent innate immune responses [27] . STING has also been shown to be negatively regulated by E3 ubiquitin transferase RING finger protein 5 (RNF5)-mediated K48linked ubiquitination, which leads to STING degradation [28] . Interestingly, RING finger protein 26 (RNF26) was shown to attenuate RNF5-directed K48-linked STING ubiquitination at K150, without affecting K63-linked STING ubiquitination, suggesting positive regulation of STING signaling [29] . The mechanism remains to be clarified about how these regulators coordinate with each other in the host cell and make cGAS-STING pathway function as a well-balanced system [29] .",

Based on biophysical and X-ray crystallographic data, the STING CTD exists as a butterfly-shaped dimer and the ligand binding site is located at the dimer interface [32e34].

However, TBK1 recruitment can't activate IRF3 alone which is different with most protein kinase whose activation is synonymous with the phosphorylation of its substrates. Rather, the phosphorylation of a conserved consensus pLxIS (p is a hydrophilic residue and x is any residue) motif, presenting in the C-terminal tail of STING (S366), is required for STING to be licensed for the interaction with IRF3 (Fig. 2D ,E) [39, 40] .

For all microbes, the most common and effective way of avoiding triggering cGAS-STING pathway is by \"hiding\" their DNA from the cytoplasm. Retroviruses and many DNA viruses keep their DNA in the viral capsid while they traverse the cytoplasm and then deliver their viral DNA into the nucleus [52] . Aside from DNA recognition in the infected cells, the upstream and downstream of cGAS-STING pathway can be damaged to brake antiviral signaling cascade. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) copes with cGAS-STING pathway through various mechanisms including disrupting DNA binding to the upstream DNA sensor of STING such as interferon-g inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and cGAS [53] , dismissing STING binding to TBK1, inhibiting STING phosphorylation [54] and so on. Herpesviruses (HSV) can hydrolyze K27/63 polyubiquitin chain on STING to prevent ubiquitination, then negatively regulate STING-mediated signaling. Similarly, Coronaviruses and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) can reduce the ubiquitination status of the STING [55e57]. Influenza A virus interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP) to inhibits STING activation in response to membrane fusion [58] . Recently, the NS2B-NS3 protease from several flaviviruses has been shown to cleave STING at the sequence \"LRRG\" in the N-terminal domain [59, 60] . Furthermore, the NS2B of dengue virus can target cGAS to induce its degradation and prevent mitochondrial DNA sensing during infection [61] .",

Most bacterial CDNs can't induce interferons in the absence of cGAS with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes, which induce interferons in a STING-dependent manner but not cGAS [70] . One possibility is that bacterial and host cells contain enzymes that selectively digest the bacterial CDNs but not the endogenous cGAMP produced by host cells [51, 71] .

Clues gleaned from human cancer gene expression profiling studies reveals an association between type I IFNs signature, T cellinflamed TME and clinical outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests that type I IFNs production might be integrally involved with adaptive T cell responses against tumor antigens [74e77]. This has allowed a focus on innate immune sensing pathways known to trigger type I IFN production that is necessary for optimal T cell priming against tumor antigens. It is an important strategy to trigger innate signaling via antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the TME might facilitate better cross-priming of tumor antigen-specific CD8 \u00fe T cells, and augment the chemokine production for the subsequent effector T cell trafficking.

Radiation can prompt DNA damage in host cells and elicit strong inflammatory triggered by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DNA damage leads to nucleosome leakage into the cytosol, then the self-DNA triggers STINGdependent cytokine production [88] . For tumor antigen-specific T cells effectively control the growth of cancer cells in vivo, they must gain access to and function within the TME, thus converting uninflamed \"cold\" tumors which don't respond to checkpoint inhibitors d into responsive \"hot\" cancers [5, 89] . Accordingly, the STING pathway projects as an essential pathway that can be targeted for cancer therapy which can stimulate adaptive immune response systemically and provide long-lived immunologic memory [90] . Up to now, many studies have discovered that CDNs treatment can increase tumor and immune cell PD-L1 expression and the combinations with STING agonists and PD-1 mAbs have potential to be translated into the clinic, especially for checkpoint blockade resistant case [91e94]. Interestingly, cancerous T cells exhibit an alternate signalling outcome in response to small molecular STING agonists, which manifests in apoptosis rather than the production of type I IFNs [95e97]. This is in sharp contrast to the response elicited by STING agonists in macrophages, dendritic cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which were found being largely apoptosis-resistant [97] . It is promising that STINGmediated stimulation of apoptosis should be further explored as a treatment option in the context of T-cell-derived human malignancies [97] .",

            "text": "Type I IFNs and mislocalized dsDNA are hallmarks and key drivers for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, loss of function mutations in the DNA exonuclease three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), which can ensure apoptotic cells remain \"immunologically silent\" following phagocytosis, lead to the excessive type I IFNs signature found in Aicardi\u00c0Goutieres syndrome (AGS) and SLE, implicating the role of self-dsDNA in autoinflammation [107e110]. Furthermore, monogenic Mendelian diseases with STING gain of function mutations such as familial chilblain lupus (FCL) support the role of STING in autoimmune disease [108] . These studies collectively suggest that cGAS-STING pathway might regulate DNAdriven inflammatory diseases [21, 36, 111] . Mutations in TREX1 cause STING activation through failure to eliminate self-DNA that has leaked into the cytosol. Mutations in STING itself can lead to constitutive activity, then cause autoinflammatory diseases such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) [19, 62] . In the patients with FCL, STING harbouring G166E mutation induces new intramolecular polar interactions to make the structure of STING dimer tighter, resulting in constitutive type I IFN signalling in the absence of cGAMP ligand [108] . Similarly, patients with vascular and pulmonary syndrome (VAPS) were found to exhibit three mutations in exon 5 of TMEM173 (N154S, V155M and V147L). These variants potently stimulated the type I IFNs promoter, as determined by in vitro expression studies in 293T cells [19] .",

This has led to academic and commercial efforts to formulate CDNs for pharmaceutical use including their advancement to an ongoing clinical trial. Unfortunately, CDNs may be chemically undesirable for research and clinical work since: 1) They violate Lipinski rules [117] for druglikeness and are not amenable to large structural changes; 2) They are susceptible to phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation [71] ; 3) Their size and hydrophilicity render them impermeable to cell membranes [78] . Small molecular STING activators can mitigate these factors, as well-exemplified by the mouse-specific compound 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) [118e120]. Identification of novel small molecule STING agonists that are efficacious across species are thus highly sought since they may develop valuable research tools to understand STING-mediated processes.

            "text": "CDNs were first described in bacteria [121] and the known naturally occurring examples consist of two nucleotides(A or G) that are cyclized by canonical phosphodiester bond to form cyclicdi-GMP (c-di-GMP), cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP) or cGAMP (Fig. 3a ) [69] . The endogenous CDNs produced by cGAS is the only known mammalian CDNs, named as 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP (Fig. 3b) , which is chemically distinct from bacterial CDNs 3 0 3 0 -cGAMP (Fig. 3a) by containing mixed phosphodiester bond. Interestingly, relative to 3 0 3 0 -cGAMP and other CDNs, 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP shows an exquisite high affinity for STING and elicits stronger type I IFNs responses. The K d of 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP was~300-fold lower than those of c-di-GMP, 3 0 2 0 -cGAMP and 3 0 3 0 -cGAMP and~75-fold lower than that of 2 0 2 0 -cGAMP [13, 122, 123] . Meanwhile, given that free CDNs alone permeate through cell membrane inefficiently in vitro but require the addition of lipofectamine or another transfection reagent, the different transmembrane capabilities of various CDNs affect the function of type I IFNs at some extent. According to the structural studies, 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP adopts an ordered conformation as a free ligand which can form more-extensive interactions inside the STING ligand-binding pocket as compared to 3 0 3 0 -cGAMP, thereby stabilizing a specific intermediate state with a readily covered lid (Fig. 4A) [13, 33] . The small-molecule nature of 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP and the promise of STING has spurred interest in applying STING agonists for vaccine adjuvants or immunotherapy [124e126] . Given that CDNs has poor druglikeness, technologies for delivering CDNs to the cytosol are required. Intravenous injection of c-di-GMP encapsulated within YSK05-liposomes induced a striking decrease of metastatic lesions in the B16F10 mouse melanoma model with almost 40% of mice showing full protection against tumor rechallenge, suggesting the induction of a memory adaptive immune response [127] . Biopolymer implants were also used to co-deliver c-di-GMP with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells [128] . Meanwhile, STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs)drationally designed polymersomes for enhanced cytosolic delivery of cGAMP which enhance STING signalling in the TME and sentinel lymph node and convert immunosuppressive tumors to immunogenic, tumoricidal microenvironments [129] . Recently, combination of cytotoxic cationic silica nanoparticles and c-di-GMP has showed dramatically increased expansion of antigen-specific CD8 \u00fe T cells and potent tumor growth inhibition in murine melanoma [131] . Taken together, CDNs has high translational potential as a therapeutic intervention strategy to induce activation of the TME in multiple tumor types, with the mechanistic goal of generating effective tumor-initiated CD8 \u00fe T cell priming and lasting anti-tumor efficacy [90] .",

To increase enzymatic stability, sulfur has been used to replace the nonbridging oxygen from the phosphodiester linkages to make phosphorothioates. The resulting compound, 2 0 3 0 -cGsAsMP (Fig. 3c) , is more resistant to degradation by the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase (ENPP1) which is identified as the major 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP hydrolase, prolonging its systemic half-life while maintaining high affinity for STING [132] . Another 'dithio' CDN analog made of two AMP moieties cyclized via 2 0 3 0 -and 3 0 5 0phosphodiester bonds (known as ML-RR-S2-CDA, MIW815 or ADU-S100) (Fig. 3c) , shows improved IFN-b responses and tumor regression in established B16 tumors when compared with 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP. Antitumor efficacy was also observed after intratumoral injection of ML-RR-S2-CDA in 4T1 and CT26 mouse models with substantial systemic immune responses capable of rejecting distant metastases and providing long-lived immunologic memory [90] . These striking preclinical results provided support for the use of ML-RR-S2-CDA in clinical trials for patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03172936 and NCT02675439), and the first results are expected in 2020. Merck & Co. launched a trial early in 2017 of a CDN compound MK-1454 alone and in combination with the approved checkpoint PD1 blocker pembrolizumab (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03010176), while the structure of this molecule has not yet been disclosed. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) acquired the biotech IFM Therapeutics put US$300 million upfront to get their hands on preclinical CDN agonist (Fig. 3) [5] .

Atomic-level understanding of the interaction between DMXAA and hSTING became available by elegant structural, biophysical and cellular assay studies reported by Gao Pu and coworkers. They identified three points substitutions (S162A, G230I and Q266I) of hSTING which synergistically rendered the mutated hSTING highly sensitive to DMXAA (Fig. 4B) . This inspiring structural and functional results shed light on strategies to restore an efficient hSTING response to DMXAA based on the binding-pocket S162A or Q266I substitutions [33, 138] . Xing Che et al. further discovered E260I mutation together with S162A endowed human STING AQ with DMXAA sensitivity. The molecular dynamics simulations showed that these two mutations changed the interaction network between DMXAA and STING AQ . Moreover, a smaller number of water molecules are displaced upon DMXAA binding to STING AQ than that on binding to its mutants, leading to a larger entropic penalty for the former [139] . Amy Y. Shih et al. unraveled the dynamic structural differences between hSTING and mSTING. Simulations found that an I230 side chain (corresponding residue in hSTING is G) was enough to form a steric barrier that prevents the exit of DMXAA, whereas in wild-type hSTING, the G230 without a side chain formed a porous lid region that allowed DMXAA to exit [35] . Such observations gave us insight into translating STING agonists from mouse active into human active, while also providing avenues to pursue for designing a small-molecule drug targeting human STING [139] .",

Given that two molecules of DMXAA bind to the STING dimer, ongoing efforts are also being directed toward the generation and evaluation of covalently linked DMXAA dimers. Meanwhile, 7-methyl-XAA and 8-methyl-XAA which involve the redistribution of CH3 substitutions on the DMXAA scaffold, have been identified as weak yet human-active and possibly also human-selective DMXAA analogs [137] . Meanwhile, Yibo Zhang et al. identified a-Mangostin (Fig. 3g) sharing the same xanthone skeleton with DMXAA as a weak agonist of hSTING [141] .

            "text": "The biological rationale linking STING to inflammatory diseases supports the development of STING antagonists. However, the general lack of biochemical mechanistic understanding of STING activation leads to a significant challenge in the development of binders to the STING protein [36] . It is inspiring that the possibility of utilizing 2:1 binding stochiometry can offset the challenge from a large binding pocket, and thus effectively compete with cGAMP, while still maintaining physiochemical properties compatible with oral drugs. With the help of Automated Ligand Identification System (ALIS), Tony Siu identified a weak antagonist C18 (Fig. 5a) of STING-mediated signaling which can compete with cGAMP at a 2:1 binding ratio in the inactive \"open\" conformation ( Fig. 4D ) [36] . The compound C18 did not stimulate IFN-b production (EC 50 ! 30 mM), but modestly inhibited cGAMP induced IFN-b production (IC 50 \u00bc 11 mM), with a >100-fold shift in potency from binding to the functional cell assay. Considering that the assay is stimulated with nonphysiological levels of cGAMP, it is speculated that the cellular IC 50 value may not be an accurate representation of antagonist potency [36] . Senlin Li et al. identified Astin C (Fig. 5b) , a cyclopeptide isolated from the medicinal plant Aster tataricus, specifically blocks the recruitment of IRF3 onto the STING signalosome through binding to the STING CTD. Astin C showed comparable binding affinity to STING R232 as 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP, with a dissociation constant value (K d ) of 53 nM. The inhibitory effect of Astin C on intracellular DNA-induced IFN-b expression was dose dependent, with IC 50 values of 3.42 \u00b1 0.13 and 10.83 \u00b1 1.88 mM for MEFs and human fetal lung fibroblasts cells (IMR-90), respectively [146] .",

Recently, studies has identified N-terminal cysteine residues at positions 88 and 91 as the palmitoylation site [37] . Palmitoylation at C88/91 was important for STING-dependent phosphorylation of TBK1 in the trans-Golgi network and thus central to STING dependent induction of type I IFNs. Anne Louise Hansen et al. have reported that endogenous nitro-conjugated linoleic acid (NO2-cLA) (Fig. 5c) can covalently modify STING by nitro-alkylation at C88/91 and H16, then lead to a deregulation of STING palmitoylation and inhibit the STING signaling in human cells, like fibroblasts from SAVI patients. Since NO2eFAs have been reported to be a well-tolerated treatment in humans (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02460146 and NCT02313064), this finding has considerable medical potential [147] . Simone M.

            "text": "Initial successes with therapies targeting the immunostimulatory effects of the cGAS-STING pathway suggest a major clinical impact in areas of cancer immunotherapy, vaccine development and autoimmune disease. However, it is a challenge to design small molecules because the dimer interface of STING CTD was dominated by hydrophobic interactions up to 65.5% with no salt bridges participating in the dimerization. The hydrophobic interface may lead to the discovery of false positive hits. Furthermore, the large ligand binding pocket in STING requires a ligand of~700 Da to occupy. Inevitably, ligands with large volume may cause downstream development problems such as toxicity and poor pharmacokinetics [148] . Joshi M. ramanjulu et al. designed a linker between two amidobenzimidazole molecules, then enhance their activities significantly [145] . Similarly, Tony Siu et al. was inspired by DMXAA binding to STING at a 2:1 ratio, they identified a series of antagonists and concluded that maximal buried interaction with STING protein can be achieved while maintaining the ligand physicochemical properties necessary for oral exposure [36] . Up to now, it has been a mainstream that \"open\" to \"closed\" conformational change is in charge of STING activation. However, the above two series of compounds can bind to the STING CTD in \"open\" conformation but produce opposite effect. Undoubtedly, the information from crystal structures is insufficient. Different ligandprotein interactions may have the capacity to alter protein flexibility, dynamics, ultimately, function. It has been recognized that dynamics is important in populating available protein conformational states, rates and probabilities of states redistribution upon ligand binding and proteins shift conformational populations through cooperative motions, while enabling their functions [139] . Consequently, it is in urgent need of molecular dynamics study of STING. Taken together, with more crystal structures of STING available and the advancement of molecular dynamics studies, structure-based and/or ligand-based design may be utilized to design novel small molecular modulators targeting STING with improved selectivity/specificity profiles [148] .",

Henrique Lemos et al. identified that STING agonists could promote the growth of tumors characterized by low antigenicity via the activation of IDO which is an immune checkpoint that attenuates tumor immunity [99] . Consequently, STING agonists may not be effective in all tumor settings, particularly those where robust tolerogenic responses to DNA and low tumor antigenicity prevail. Furthermore, hyperactivation of STING is likely to spark a severe inflammatory response called a cytokine storm [153] , in which levels of cytokines become abnormally high. The occurrence of cytokine storm results in fever, low blood pressure, heart problems and, in some cases, organ failure and death. Meanwhile, the existence of SNPs in hSTING leads to some patients showing low response to STING agonists. Combination with personalized cancer immunotherapy offers the potential to make the therapy more specific, more effective and safer compared with the cancer immunotherapies that we have available today [154] .",
