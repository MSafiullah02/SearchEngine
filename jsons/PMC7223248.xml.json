Whereas patients with respiratory failure would have previously received IMV, in the UK for example, this is now largely reserved for patients who fail a trial of NIV. Furthermore, few published studies have reported the impact of NIV on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes [3] or economic costs associated with NIV in critical care settings [5, 6]. Where these have been reported, sample sizes are small [6] or focus has solely been on patients with an exacerbation of COPD. Importantly, only one study, conducted in Canada, has estimated the cost effectiveness of NIV as a weaning strategy in patients with COPD [7], whereas, to our knowledge, no study has estimated its cost effectiveness in patients within the ICU presenting with or without COPD.",

The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each divided into three ordinal levels: (1) no problems, (2) some or moderate problems, and (3) severe or extreme problems. The UK time trade-off tariff was applied to each set of responses to generate an EQ-5D-3L utility score for each participant [23]. Given the challenges of collecting baseline data from patients in critical care settings, we assumed in the baseline analysis that the baseline utility value was \u2212 0.402, the value assigned by the EQ-5D-3L tariff to an unconscious health state [24]. QALY values for each patient were calculated as the area under the baseline-adjusted utility curve [25] assuming a fixed baseline of \u2212 0.402 (equivalent to an unconscious health state) and using linear interpolation between baseline and follow-up utility scores. QALYs were also derived from 6-Dimension Short-Form survey (SF-6D) utilities (UK tariff), generated from responses to the SF-12 as a sensitivity analysis [26], assuming a baseline utility value of zero. Patients who survived the initial hospital admission were also asked to recollect their pre-admission health state using both the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-12 questionnaires.",

In this cost-effectiveness analysis, health resource use and HRQoL beyond liberation from ventilation were considered, which could logically result in differing conclusions. We observed that, on average, patients in the invasive group stayed about 1 day long in the ICU than those in the non-invasive group (Table 1 in the ESM). Moreover, other costs, including broader NHS and broader societal costs, also influenced the observed cost differential in favour of NIV. In addition, improved QALYs associated with NIV were observed once deaths are accounted for (driven by more deaths in the IMV arm). The cost-effectiveness analysis considered a broader assessment of consequences than the clinical study, resulting in a conclusion that NIV weaning may be cost effective, particularly for patients with COPD.",

Hence, this trial provides useful data to prospectively design a future (larger) confirmatory trial with longer follow-up that could demonstrate long-term cost effectiveness. In the more optimistic scenario, where NIV was projected over 5 years to be cheaper by \u00a3302 (Table 2; Table 8 in the ESM), the sample size required would be around 120 per group (240 in total). The observed probabilities of cost effectiveness observed in this trial, although < 80%, may partly be because the sample size (n = 364 vs. n = 430) was smaller than required to demonstrate cost effectiveness [36].",

Previous studies have compared the cost effectiveness of NIV weaning with other strategies and in different countries and clinical settings. Chandra et al. [7] conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple interventions for COPD, including a comparative assessment of weaning protocols (NIV vs. weaning with invasive ventilation), within the Canadian setting, using a Markov probabilistic model. The results indicated that weaning with NIV dominated weaning with invasive ventilation; the probability of cost effectiveness for NIV weaning exceeded 99% at cost-effectiveness thresholds as low as $25,000 per QALY gained. Nonetheless, the analysis was restricted to patients with COPD. We also considered using the data from Chandra et al. [7] as an external input but felt that long-term extrapolations of survival could be misleading or unreliable because the populations differed. Other studies reported costs associated with NIV weaning in critical care settings [5, 6] but did not report HRQoL outcomes and were either based on small sample sizes [6] or focussed solely on patients with a COPD exacerbation [37].",

Costs and outcomes were carefully considered in the trial design with a view to reaching a robust cost-effectiveness conclusion based on a large sample. However, potential limitations to this analysis do exist. First, we assumed that the baseline utility value for each patient was \u2212 0.402, the value assigned by the UK EQ-5D-3L tariff to an unconscious health state. This assumption is in keeping with broader methodological practice for trial-based economic evaluations conducted in critical care settings [38]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that applying alternative fixed baseline utility scores generally had no effect on incremental QALY calculations [38]. Second, approximately 35% of QALY data and 6\u201340% of costs (at the component level) were missing by 6 months. Had our base-case cost-effectiveness analysis only considered individuals with complete QALY and cost data, we would have removed approximately 50% of patients from the analysis, which would have likely biased the results. After demonstrating that the data were missing at random, we used multiple imputation to \u2018replace\u2019 missing values to allow a comprehensive analysis using the whole dataset. Third, the modelling undertaken was constrained by assumptions concerning post-6-month costs and health utilities. However, a systematic search of external studies that compared these two weaning approaches revealed that none reported long-term economic outcomes. As a result, the evidence base for extrapolating cost effectiveness is currently weak. Longer follow-up would have reduced uncertainty surrounding our long-term cost-effectiveness estimates.",
