            "text": "First, we know that HIV is not transmitted when people living with HIV keep their viral levels undetectable [4]. Yet remaining undetectable depends on regular access to blood tests to show medications are working. As machines and people who conduct these tests are re-purposed for COVID-19, fewer tests for HIV viral load will be available. Fewer clinicians will have time to meet with patients. Patients will be less certain of their HIV status. This threatens hard fought scientific advancements, including treatment as prevention [5]. Now is the time to triage viral load tests, and prioritize tests for patients with histories of poorly controlled levels. Tele-health visits for patients with histories of consistently undetectable levels can preserve valuable clinician resources. We know how to do this, but never before at scale. Let us try to do that now, and study the process as we do. Work is already underway by University of Pennsylvania researchers2 to work with the public health department and community to evaluate the most effective existing and new U=U messaging. A similar effort has been initiated by Yale investigators in Puerto Rico.3 This work continues and could be undertaken in many more communities.",

Today, most of these venues are closed for safety reasons. Unfortunately, the need for these testing services is unchanged. Moreover, in-person testing in clinics and emergency rooms is all but impossible as infectious disease expertise is shifted toward COVID-19. The costs for even temporary stoppage of freely available HIV testing risks new, undetected HIV infections\u2014backsteps our communities cannot afford. Science shows that most new HIV transmissions are linked to people who become newly infected but are unaware of their HIV positive status [6, 7]\u2014just like with COVID-19. Until venue-based testing is back in full effect, now is the time to scale-up access to free or low-cost in-home testing kits. On-line web pages on sexual health can be developed easily in collaboration with individuals who have lost their jobs or companies who want to be altruistic, to distribute kits. Yale-funded researchers are partnering with collaborators in Puerto Rico to learn how best to ramp up home HIV-testing, never more important. In Miami,4 early-stage investigators have launched a project to provide free HIV testing and same-day start packet for HIV medications, in mobile syringe services programs. A UCSF project team5 is already working on implementation of a sexual health model for rural Sacramento County, California. They aim to adapt an evidence-based sexual health services intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake to fit the local HIV epidemic in Sacramento County where racial and ethnic minority populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. It\u2019s important to duplicate this work in high-need jurisdictions around the country.",

Though PrEP is available at any medical office, most patients get PrEP from infectious disease and primary care clinicians comfortable and effective in prescribing PrEP [9]. These challenges are magnified as clinicians who prescribe PrEP are called to manage COVID-19. Tele-health companies already have solved this problem and can provide PrEP remotely [10]. Pharmacies are being considered for dispensing PrEP already, with potential for providing this service with minimal clinical resource [11, 12]. These critical resources need to be scaled quickly. We need to identify who will lead this effort, and use our discretionary time to organize a massive push on this front. There are already models to draw from. University of Miami researchers and Latinos Salud, a South Florida-based Latino MSM HIV-agency are working with Walgreens, CVS, Navarro and Target pharmacies to build an HIV Pharmacy Network to reach Latino men in Miami Dade county. And more: Now is the time to build academic and community partnerships in preparing for implementation of low-threshold use of long-acting injectable (LAI) ART as HIV prevention in anticipation of likely FDA approval and commercial availability [13].",

Lab machines that test for STDs are different than those used to test for COVID-19, but the clinics and clinicians who test and treat STDs are involved heavily in the fight against COVID-19. This risks further the release of a key lever to diagnose and treat STIs and HIV. Now is the time to broaden venues for STI testing to involve primary care, addiction treatment settings, or anywhere that makes sense in each jurisdiction. This may require considerate and strategic communication with policymakers and community leaders to keep attention to STIs in this era of COVID-19. Strategy sessions now can help re-commit to keeping free or low-cost STI testing as the bellwether of sexual health in our communities.",

Differential costs for redirecting resources to COVID-19 include leaving further behind those who live with these comorbidities, including increasing numbers of those living with consistently high viral counts, of those who cannot sustain PrEP use, and consequently with the number of those who become HIV-infected.

With shelter-in-place orders, again, access to these supplies is severely limited. On the other hand, shelter-in-place orders leave lots of time to fill. People will have sex and use drugs to pass the time and in ways that are also entirely predictable and understandable, but that also confer risks for HIV infection. But do we know this? Let\u2019s ask them. There are many NIH-funded ongoing studies with cohorts of HIV negative and HIV positive participants who also stand at the ready to help, and with time on their hands! Let\u2019s ask them important questions and use their responses to help those in their community who are not as fortunate to be in such studies. Without access to harm reduction supplies, new HIV infections (and STIs and Hepatitis-C)\u2014are unavoidable. Now is the time for pharmacies to ensure access to syringes, for all of us to place condoms and lube anywhere people are still congregating. Another round of NIH supplements funded through the End the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America Initiative [19] includes inspiring work to reach African-Americas in five venues in five Miami Dade zip codes with the highest number of Black individuals living with HIV: (1) barbershops, (2) hair/beauty salons, (3) laundromats, (4) corner stores, and (5) mechanics.
