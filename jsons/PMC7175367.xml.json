            "text": "Hepatitis C is a life-threatening, widespread viral infection [1]. The virus initially infects liver cells though remains asymptomatic for extended periods. This invisibility constitutes epidemiological challenges as patients diagnosed with hepatitis C come from two pools: recently infected and late-stage asymptomatic. The initial symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, nausea, and liver tenderness, can be misleading, as they are tolerated by most patients. After several years of this blood-borne infection, the virus activates, replicates, and causes complications that start with liver scarring, fibrosis followed by cirrhosis and, eventually, liver failure and carcinoma [2,3]. Awareness of hepatitis C health problems and forceful efforts to combat the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in healthcare settings have led to a significant decline in new hepatitis C cases. However, the annual death toll from complications of this disease remains as high as 400,000 due to the above described unique clinical vs. epidemic profile of the chronic hepatitis C. An estimated 70 million people globally are currently infected with HCV, constituting a major health problem [1]. In 2013, the death rate from HCV complications surpassed that of HIV. In 2015, hepatitis C-related deaths exceeded that of tuberculosis and malaria combined [4].",

Identification of the hepatitis C genome\u2013proteome in the early 1990s prompted intensive research that led to the introduction of the new class of direct antiviral agents (DAAs). DAAs revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and succeeded to control the global crisis of this epidemic that was once described as the \u201cThird Millennium Challenge\u201d [2]. Recently, combinations of DAAs have become an effective way to cover hepatitis C infection of different genotypes [6,7]. Nonetheless, according to the World Health Organization, there are several remaining challenges that must be met to eradicate HCV [1]: (1) access to the treatment in economically challenged areas, which must be increased [8]; (2) emerging drug resistance, which is an expected problem even with combination therapy [9,10]; and (3) efficacy in broader sectors of HCV patients, such as the elderly and impaired kidney and liver patients, which must be improved [11]. Thus, there is a clear need to identify new approaches to inhibit viral targets and to increase the DAA arsenal [12].",

            "text": "The HCV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to Flaviviridae [13]. The translated virus genome mainly corresponds to structural and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural (NS) proteins include NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, which comprise factors essential for the maturation and replication of the virus [14]. NS3 dually functions as a protease (N-terminal domain) and an RNA helicase (C-terminal domain) [15]. When activated as a protease, it catalyzes the processing of the viral proteome to functional proteins by cleaving NS3\u2013NS4A, NS4A\u2013NS4B, NS4B\u2013NS5A, and NS5A\u2013NS5B junctions. The proper folding of NS3 is indispensable for protease activity and occurs only when it binds to NS4A, a 54 amino acid peptide with multiple functions. NS4A is not only required for NS3 activation [16,17] but is also important for the integration of NS3 into the host cell endoplasmic reticulum [18] and for neutralizing the host cell immune responses [19,20]. The NS3/4A protease was the first and foremost targeted viral protein with DAAs that bind to its substrate site [21]. Interference with the NS4A binding site, on the other hand, has not been evaluated thoroughly as a mechanism to allosterically inhibit the NS3 protein, especially by drug-like peptidomimetics. In this article, we present compounds that were designed to compete with and replace NS4A on its NS3 binding site, leading to NS3 inhibition [22]. ",

The association with NS4A induces proper conformation of the apoenzyme and increases the proteolytic activity of NS3 by ~950 times [14,16,23]. Accumulated evidence established that the central region of NS4A (Gly21`-Leu32`) is sufficient for activation of the NS3 protease [24,25,26,27]. Throughout this paper, the prime (`) mark is applied to differentiate the residues of NS4A from that of the NS3 apoenzyme. It has also been confirmed by our laboratory [28,29] and others [26,30] that certain mutants can bind to the NS4A site and inhibit the protease function of NS3. In their reporting of the first crystal structure of NS3/4A, Kim and coworkers stated that \u201cthe contact surface between NS3 and NS4A is quite extensive and provides another possible site for the design of anti-HCV chemotherapeutic agents\u201d [14]. However, subsequent research focused merely on the discovery of NS3/4A substrate site inhibitors, while mention of the NS4A site inhibitors is rare, with only a few reports describing a hypothetical approach [14,31,32]. Accordingly, we decided to pursue this concept by designing peptidomimetics that bind and replace NS4A on the protease domain of NS3.",

This planar kink is composed of one eclipsed cis bond with a dihedral angle of \u221212\u00b0 (the negative sign denotes a deviation to the opposite side of the Val-26` side chain) and four near perfect planar trans bonds spanning through Val-26` to Arg-28` (Figure 1A, torsion table in Supplementary Material Table S1A).

Accordingly, we postulated that an imidazole nucleus appending two amide groups should mimic this planar region. Docking experiments by manual visually guided methods suggest that the 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide nucleus can occupy the planar region while keeping key interactions of NS4A in place without posing significant steric conflicts (Figure 1B). In particular, the N1 of the imidazole acted as a hydrogen bond donor with the backbone carbonyl of Ile-35 (located in the A1 \u03b2-sheet), which also made a hydrogen bond with CO of the 5-carboxamide group of the designed scaffold. The carbonyl of the C2-carboxamide group occupied a planar area in which Val-26` rests. ",

In the context of probing this hydrophobic pocket, we decided to synthesize compounds of different hydrophobic substituents at the C2 amide group.

This assay measures the recovered fluorescence emitted upon cleavage of the labeled peptide substrate representing the NS4A/NS4B junction [43]. Considering that NS3 without NS4A is almost a thousand-times less catalytic [23], the method was modified to suit the purpose of our allosteric inhibition assay. For instance, we used a large amount of free NS3 protein (2.00 \u00b5M) as a smaller concentration did not show measurable catalytic activity in the absence of cofactors. The addition of 4.00 \u00b5M amounts of MOC-24 resulted in a complete loss of NS3 catalytic activity. As a positive control, an equimolar mixture of NS4A with NS3 (equimolar, 2.00 \u00b5M each) caused only a 9-fold increase in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (Figure 5), which was far less than the reported value [23], possibly due to the large amount of protein used.

The MD simulation tries to disrupt non-bonding interactions between the ligand and the binding site residues by applying energy snapshots that result in conformational excitations followed by relaxations until equilibration occurs [44]. Equilibration of the system can be determined by plotting the protein\u2019s backbone\u2013ligand root mean square deviation (PL-RMSD) vs. the simulation time.

The MD simulation model of MOC-24 demonstrated three important features: (a) the ligand resided during the entire simulation period (20.0 ns) within the boundaries of the presumed binding region of NS4A25`\u201328` located between the A0 and A1 \u03b2-strands; (b) the imidazole nucleus had low interaction fluctuations; and (c) the n-hexyl side chain stayed deep in the hydrophobic pocket accommodating the Ile-25` side chain (a video illustration is available as part of the Supplementary Material). Monitoring the PL-RMSD of the NS3/MOC-24 simulation indicated that the conformational fluctuations of the NS3 protein (backbone atoms) equilibrated after ~10.0 ns and this status was maintained towards the end of the simulation period (Figure 6). Meanwhile, the ligand (MOC-24) equilibrated at ~13.4 ns. Both the protein and the ligand clearly showed the least fluctuations after 17.5 ns and until the simulation ended at 20 ns, indicating that the complex reached stability at this binding mode. ",
