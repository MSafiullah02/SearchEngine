Infants with wheezing severe enough to require hospitalization seem to have host\u2010specific characteristics, such as atopy or eosinophilia, which modify their responses to viral infections (7). So far, risk factors for later lung function abnormalities or for the persistence of bronchial hyper\u2010responsiveness (BHR) after wheezing in infancy have rarely been studied in prospective settings with long\u2010term follow\u2010ups after infantile wheeze.",

The baseline FEV1 value was applied in the comparisons, with the measurements done 1.5 min after each methacholine dose. The test was continued until a 20% fall in FEV1, or until a cumulative dose of 4900 \u03bcg of methacholine was reached. The exact cumulative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was determined by semilogarithmic interpolation and termed the provocative dose (PD20) (23).

Analysis of covariance was applied to assess the significance of the differences in the continuous baseline FVS parameters (percentages of the gender\u2010specific height\u2010related reference values) between children with and without a risk factor present. Each risk factor was analyzed separately, with age on admission included as a covariate. In this model, age on admission acted as an effect modifier with interaction with risk factors. Similar analyses were performed between children with and without RSV or rhinovirus aetiology of wheeze. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age on admission, was applied to assess the differences, estimated as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), for abnormal lung function values and bronchial responsiveness between children with and without certain risk factors present. Each risk factor was analyzed separately. Because atopic dermatitis on study entry was common among children with rhinovirus aetiology for wheezing (8), adjustment for early atopic dermatitis was added in the analyses concerning viruses and FVS or challenge test results. Adjustment for sex was included in the analyses for BHR, but not, due to the availability of gender\u2010specific references, in the analyses for FVS.",

First, FVS was, on average, within normal limits. However, 33% of the children had abnormal results in some individual parameters. Second, wheezing with RSV was associated with reduced FVC, suggesting a restrictive pattern of lung function. Third, BHR was rather common, presenting by the applied criteria in 26\u201346%. BHR to exercise was associated with early sensitization to inhalant allergens and maternal smoking during pregnancy. BHR to methacholine was associated with a history of atopic dermatitis in infancy.",

The observations suggest persistent bronchial obstruction after RSV bronchiolitis. In contrast, in our study, 10\u201312 years after hospitalization for wheezing at <24 months of age, RSV bronchiolitis seemed to be associated with a restrictive pattern of lung function abnormality, documented by significantly decreased FVC values concomitantly with normal FEV1 values and even elevated FEV1/FVC values. In this study, children with former RSV bronchiolitis were compared with selected controls, subjects with former bronchiolitis not caused by RSV. Rhinoviruses were the most dominant viruses in this RSV\u2010negative group, and the rhinovirus group evidently included children with their first asthma episode (8, 9). To diminish this bias, age and atopy, which were associated with rhinovirus aetiology in this cohort, were included in the multivariate model, and RSV aetiology still was an independent risk factor for lower FVC. On the other hand, evidence of permanent restriction found in the present study, as well as evidence of permanent obstruction found by Sigurs et al. (4), may reflect premorbid structural changes in infants susceptible to severe RSV infection (1).",

In the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) study, FVC growth velocities were higher among children with asthma than among children without asthma until 14 years for boys and 12 years for girls (24). In the present cohort, asthma was more common after RSV\u2010negative than after RSV\u2010positive bronchiolitis (9), and FVC growth velocity pattern comparable to the subjects in the CAMP study could explain our findings. On the other hand, we have recently found that asthma and bronchial hyper\u2010reactivity, after many nonsymptomatic years, have a tendency to recur in early adulthood (25). Therefore, minor changes in lung function or in bronchial reactivity, though clinically nonsignificant, may be useful predictors of subsequent morbidity.",

Wennergren et al. did not find any association between early atopy and asthma or BHR at the age of 10 years (5). In the present cohort, instead, the presence of atopic dermatitis or specific IgE in inhalant allergens in early life were significant predictors of asthma at teenage (9) and were also independent risk factors for BHR, as seen in the present paper. Our findings are in accordance with a recent birth cohort study from Germany (26), in which BHR at school age was significantly associated with sensitization to perennial allergens in early life, particularly in those children who suffered from current wheezing.",

In the present study, there was no significant association between passive smoking in infancy and abnormal lung function at late school age. The results were similar when maternal and paternal smoking were analyzed separately. In contrast, maternal smoking during pregnancy was an independent risk factor for BHR to exercise, even after adjustment with passive smoking in infancy. Although there is some evidence that in utero exposure to tobacco smoke may increase bronchial responsiveness continuing through childhood (28), many factors, such early\u2010life passive smoking and later active smoking, complicate the interpretation of the results (28, 29). In the present study, tobacco smoke exposure in infancy was rather common, presenting in 46% of the cases (9), but none of the children smoked at the time of the study visit. A recent Swedish long\u2010term follow\u2010up after bronchiolitis in infancy stressed the link between early\u2010life tobacco smoke exposure, later BHR and later asthma (30). Early passive smoking was an independent risk factor for BHR and for active smoking at young adult age, and both of them were associated with chronic asthma (30).",

FVS was studied twice 2 weeks apart, with nearly identical results, and bronchial responsiveness was studied by two methods, reflecting different mechanisms of BHR. In addition, our patients represented a certain child population, and covered the whole spectrum of hospital\u2010treated bronchiolitis, because our university hospital is the only one providing inpatient care for children in this area. Thus, we regard our results concerning both lung function and bronchial responsiveness trustworthy and representative for school children with early\u2010life hospitalization for wheezing. The main shortcoming of the study was the absence of a control group. On the other hand, population\u2010based gender\u2010specific height\u2010related reference values were available for lung function studies. Because lung function abnormalities were rather rare, and bronchial hyper\u2010reactivity was rare in the subgroups constructed on the basis of early risk factors, some differences were probably missed due to insufficient power of the study. Because of the lack of a control group, and of an obvious underpowering for stratified analyses, the conclusions from the present results should be drawn carefully.",
