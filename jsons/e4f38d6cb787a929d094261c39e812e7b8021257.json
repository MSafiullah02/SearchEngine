Social isolation is a risk 5 factor for development of loneliness but some persons enjoy it (e.g., hermits). Conversely, having 6 social relationship does not assure that loneliness will not develop, because the social relationship 7 has to be meaningful. Many people feel lonely under the best of circumstances. Approximately one-8 quarter (24 percent) of community-dwelling Americans aged 65 and older are considered to be 9 socially isolated, and a significant proportion of adults in the United States report feeling lonely (35 10 percent of adults aged 45 and older and 43 percent of adults aged 60 and older) 1 . 11 Loneliness is even more common in long-term care institutions. The prevalence of severe 12 loneliness among older people living in care homes is at least double that of community-dwelling 13 populations: 22-42% for the resident population compared with 10% for the community 14 population. 2 . One study found that more than half of nursing home residents without cognitive 15 impairment reported feeling lonely 3 . A study in Malaysian nursing homes using UCLA loneliness 16 scale found that all residents felt lonely, 25% moderately and 75% severely 4 .

The third dimension is a 34 lack of an active network group, consisting from 150 to 1500 people, who provide support just by In all countries impacted by Covid-19 the message that is being sent by government officials and 38 medical experts is \"stay at home\" and \"isolate in place\".
