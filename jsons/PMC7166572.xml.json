Although the agent most commonly detected in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae [Marcos et al., 2009], the new high sensitive techniques have allowed to detect many respiratory viruses associated to adult CAP [Johnstone et al., 2008; Marcos et al., 2009], mostly influenza virus (Flu) [Johnstone et al., 2008; Luchsinger et al., 2013], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [Luchsinger et al., 2013], parainfluenza virus (PIV) [Henrickson, 2003], and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [Luchsinger et al., 2013]. Rhinovirus (RV) [Luchsinger et al., 2013] and human coronavirus (hCoV) [Johnstone et al., 2008; Luchsinger et al., 2013; Berry et al., 2015] have also been detected, but their pathogenic role is controversial; human bocavirus (hBoV) is rarely detected in adults [Berry et al., 2015].",

Antigen detection by immunofluorescent assays (IFA) are routinely used for detecting respiratory viruses in children with good performance (95%) [Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010]; however, highly sensitive techniques must be used in adults due to the low viral shedding [Casiano\u2010Colon et al., 2003; Fox, 2007; Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010]. Real time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (rtRT\u2010PCR) is a nucleic acid amplification method used in diagnostic, which has enhanced the viral detection. The high sensitivity of new methodologies such as Luminex\u00ae system has increased the diagnostic capacity allowing the detection of many viruses at the same time [Fox, 2007; Krunic et al., 2007; Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010]; furthermore, commercial kits are now available (xTAG\u00ae RVP assay). This method has displayed 98.0% sensitivity over IFA/viral culture [Merante et al., 2007] and 78.8% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity over RT\u2010PCR [Gadsby et al., 2010]; however, in a recent study [Choudhary et al., 2016], sensitivity of xTAG\u00ae RVP in a pediatric population was only 68.3%, whereas the sensitivity of in\u2010house conventional RT\u2010PCR and real time RT\u2010PCR were 96.9% and 87.9%, respectively. In adults, xTAG\u00ae RVP has been scantily studied, and in these studies, patients with diverse respiratory illness have been included [She et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2015]; therefore, its performance in adult CAP is unknown. Since xTAG\u00ae RVP performance may differ in different populations and CAP is a public health problem, it is necessary to establish its performance in pneumonia to optimize diagnosis, and therefore the medical management of these patients.",

There are few comparative studies of diagnostic methods done for all the common respiratory viruses [Lieberman et al., 2009] and the even fewer done in adults [Jeong et al., 2014]. The performance of samples has varied according to the detection method applied and sensitivity of NPA and NPS have varied in children according to the virus detected [Ieven, 2007; Huijskens et al., 2014]. Thus, the clinical diagnostic is influenced by both the pannel of respiratory virus searched and the sampling method used.",

The study was approved by the University and Health Institutional Ethics Committee and all subjects gave written informed consent at enrolment. CAP was defined by the presence of acute respiratory symptoms for less than 1 week and chest X\u2010ray showing new pulmonary infiltrates. Exclusion criteria included immunocompromising conditions (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus infection, active treatment for cancer, organ transplant, immunosuppressive therapy) and hospitalizations within 30 days preceding enrolment. Information on age, gender, prior antibiotic treatment, and co\u2010morbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiac failure, liver damage, renal, or neurologic disease) were recorded for all patients in standard files. Chest radiographic patterns were described by independent radiologists as alveolar, interstitial, or mixed infiltrates. Patient severity was assessed during the first 48 hr after enrolment by the pneumonia severity index (PSI) described by [Fine et al., 1997], that evaluates gender; age; neoplasic, cardiac, respiratory, and renal illness; clinical parameters (respiratory rate, pulse, etc.); X\u2010ray and laboratory parameters (hematocrit, partial pressure of oxygen, pleural effusion, etc). According to Fine score, patients are classified as having mild (scores 1 and 2) or severe CAP (scores 3\u20135).",

This agrees with most of the previous publications in children and adult, but with global respiratory infections. Consequently, it should be included as a routine laboratory test due to the high frequency of viral detection in these patients (59.3%), which confirm the relevant role of viruses in adult pneumonia [Henrickson, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2008; Marcos et al., 2009; Ruuskanen et al., 2011; Luchsinger et al., 2013;].",

In addition, IFA is operator dependent and detects only five viruses whereas xTAG\u00ae RVP and rtRT\u2010PCR have the ability to test much more viruses and to run many samples simultaneously. Thus, although Luminex\u00ae is the most expensive technique, it is worth of application considering shortening of the patient treatment and hospital stay [Mahony et al., 2007; Dundas et al., 2011].",

However, some viruses were detected only by rtRT\u2010PCR and not by Luminex\u00ae, in spite that the same nucleic acids extracts were tested by both techniques. A unique extraction method (Sacace\u00ae kit) was applied assuming that different extraction methods tested does not influence the results [Krunic et al., 2007], but it cannot be completely ruled out [Verheyen et al., 2012]. Discrepant results might also be explained through a better primer targeting of RT\u2010PCR and because rtRT\u2010PCR was performed immediately after collection, while all extracts used by xTAG\u00ae RVP were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C, in order to have enough number of samples to reduce costs. Thus, 17/19 samples with low viral loads, according to high Ct (\u226527), could have lost some RNA because of thawing, resulting negative by Luminex\u00ae; however, this fact does not explain the discrepancy of two cases showing Ct < 26 and detected only by rtRT\u2010PCR or Ct  \u2265 30 in nine RV detected by both methods.",

Since, xTAG\u00ae RVP does not distinguish between RV and EV the difference could be due to extra cases of 22 EV detected by Luminex\u00ae [Gadsby et al., 2010].

Furthermore, only 7.5% (8/106) of all viral detections by either method were in NPS, as compared to 21.7% only in NPA (23/106).
