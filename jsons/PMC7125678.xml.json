However, a multiplexed PCR analysis with Anyplex II RV16 of respiratory secretion samples that detects a panel of 16 viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus) yielded positive results, namely, the presence of both human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and bocavirus (HBoV). hMPV had a high early cycle threshold value (24.1), which indicated a high viral load, whereas HBoV had a value close to its lower limit of detection. As confirming evidence, hMPV was also detected in lung biopsy samples, as well as biopsy samples of other organs. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was identified in a lung biopsy sample, but the copy number was low (< 500 UI/mL). The overall results of post-mortem virologic samples are summarized in Table 1\n.

All children were symptomatic, with upper respiratory tract infections (45%), lower respiratory tract infections (25%), or flu-like syndrome (13%). Five required hospitalisation (median hospital stay was 3 days) for lower respiratory tract infections (Table 1) and received probabilistic antibiotics.

As further support, no other well-described human pathogens besides HBoV and CMV were detected. HBoV was present at low levels in one nasopharyngeal sample and may have simply been a bystander as it was not found in lung parenchyma samples and its pathogenic potential is debated [3]. CMV was present at a low level in one lung biopsy sample in the absence of CMV viremia. Specific anti-CMV IgM immunoglobulins are likely unrelated to the sudden death observed in this case, and asymptomatic CMV reactivation frequently occurs during infections caused by other agents. Immune system evaluation (weight dosage of immunoglobulins) was performed on post-mortem samples, but a diagnosis of immunodeficiency was impossible without precise functional and quantitative analysis of lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and monocytes. However, we did not try to quantify T-cell-receptor excision circles (TRECs) from the neonatal screening sample.",

One patient died of uncontrolled ARDS [6], whereas another died after acute pulmonary hemorrhage soon after admission [7]; neither patient had any significant medical history. Another patient presented with a secondary immunodeficiency owing to immunosuppression for hepatic transplantation [5]. Immunodeficiency has been linked to severe viral respiratory infections. Additional associations include TLR4 mutations with severe RSV bronchiolitis [8], IFIH1 loss-of-function mutations (which prevent sensing of viral RNA) with severe RNA virus (RSV and human rhinovirus) infections [9], and IRF7 [10] and IRF 9 [11] with severe influenza pneumonitis. All these genes are involved in innate immunity and interferon pathways and have been implicated in a theory proposing that monogenic inborn errors of immunity underlie susceptibility to specific infections [12]. In the diseases noted above, the patient might not have any additional infections, and hence standard immunological tests would have yielded normal results. This premise is compatible with our case, as there was no remarkable medical history.",

The observation of multiple co-infections, with up to three different viruses in some children, indicates that proximity among young children promotes transmission and exchange of pathogens (Table 2). Owing to its high sensitivity, PCR may detect several pathogens, which introduces confusion since it cannot distinguish between causative pathogens and other potentially infectious agents or residual pathogenic signatures of prior infections.
