However, the spread of COVID-19 has been quite heterogeneous in speed, reach, and lethality, not only from country to country, but also in different regions of the same country. The main possible explanation is given by the delay between the onset of the epidemic, the first diagnosis and the kick-off of containment measures. Other reasons may be due to region-specific variables, such as population density and mean age, societal structure and behaviors. A third factor depends also on the adopted policies for containment and testing, in particular for what concerns the fraction of infectious individuals that do not display symptoms (asymptomatic).",

As Italy was the first western country affected by the SARS-CoV-2 and for which region-specific and intervention-related data was readily available, our analysis was focused on the Italian case. This has allowed us to study how the virus spreads at a very different pace in different Italian districts. The typical SIR model assumes that some degree of immunity, at least temporary, is acquired after SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, it is assumed that subjects move from the S (Susceptible) compartment to the I (Infectious) compartment, and from there, with a daily rate equal to the invers of recovery time, to the R (Recovered) compartment, until the relative densities of S and I become too low for the epidemic to continue. In order to simulate the behavior of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, an A (Asymptomatic) and P (Pre-symptomatic) compartment were added to the model.",

Subjects in the P compartments then transfer to the I compartment with a daily rate of 1/\u03c4 i , where \u03c4 i is the incubation period. We also assume that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients are less infectious than symptomatic individuals by a factor f . However, there is evidence that pre-sympromatic individual are highly infectious already about \u03c4 d = 2 days before symptom onset [3] , and the focus of our model is transmission dynamics, rather than symptoms manifestations. Under this profile, a P subject is already akin to a I \u03c4 d days before symptom onset. Therefore, we let P subjects move into I compartment after a incubation period that is \u03c4 d = 2 days shorter, while at the same time increasing recovery time by the same amount.",

Such an application is heavily reliant, on one hand, on effectiveness of case isolation on part of the authorities, and on the other hand on compliance and widespread use of the system by the population. Thus, we assume, for our model, that a J fraction of symptomatic cases is identified and undergoes perfect quarantine with zero contacts. We call j the fraction of the population using the app and we assume that once in quarantine, they reduce the contact rate by a factor q. Therefore, j 2 is the fraction of contacts that happen between individuals using the app. Quarantined subjects that develop the infection undergo the entire course of the disease, whereas those that were not infected in the contact eventually exit quarantine after the quarantine period \u03c4 q (15 days) and become Susceptible again. In the classic SIR model, the rate of transfer between the S and I compartments depends on transmission rate \u03b2, that is, the product of number of contacts per subject, C, and probability of transmission during a single contact \u00b5 [7] .",

This is a measure that is not readily estimable, which is why in the present work we showed results for a series of credible scenarios; however, using mobility data from European cities we managed to obtain credible figures to plug-in the model. Our model does take into account interpersonal distance in the form of R parameter; a potential expansion of this framework is to account for time spent within the 1m interpersonal distance, as well as distinguishing between high-risk (e.g. taxis, buses) and low-risk (e.g. walking, personal car) means of transportation.",

The model can be further improved and expanded by adding age-specific compartments, sex and gender factors, and risk classes, by refining the implementation of vital dynamics, and by modeling different methods for contact tracing with varying degree of compliance.",
