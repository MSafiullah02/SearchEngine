The illness is a direct result of infection by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was first identified in March of 2003. SARS-CoV is sufficiently divergent from all previously identified coronaviruses that it may represent a distinct lineage (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Current evidence suggests the virus emerged from nonhuman sources (Guan et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2003), possibly as a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses (Rest and Mindell, 2003, Stanhope et al., 2004, Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004).",

The principal \u201cconserved\u201d open reading frames occur in the same order and are of similar size as those found in other coronaviruses. These include, from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, genes for the replicase (rep), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition to the conserved genes, six or more novel open reading frames are predicted at the 3\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV genome (ORFs 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, 8ab, and 9b) (Snijder et al., 2003). So far, the functions of these genes remain unknown. Their absence from other genomes suggests that they might carry out unique functions in SARS-CoV replication, assembly, or virulence. Similarly positioned \u201caccessory genes\u201d have proven dispensable for coronavirus viability in vitro, although their deletion often leads to viral attenuation in vivo (de Haan et al., 2002). These genes are therefore particularly interesting, considering that nonessential accessory genes from a wide array of viruses function to circumvent host innate and adaptive immune responses (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000, Ploegh, 1998).",

Sequence analysis predicts that ORF 7a encodes a type I transmembrane protein, 122 amino acids in length, consisting of a 15 residue N-terminal signal peptide, an 81 residue luminal domain, a 21 residue transmembrane segment, and a 5 residue cytoplasmic tail. Although the orf7a sequence has been identified in all isolates of SARS-CoV collected from both human and animal sources, it appears to be unique to SARS, displaying no significant similarity to any other viral or nonviral protein. Here, we examine the orf7a accessory protein in an attempt to clarify its biological significance and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. Using an E. coli expression system, we have successfully produced the luminal domain of orf7a as soluble protein by oxidative refolding. We have determined the crystal structure of orf7a to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution, revealing a compact Ig-like domain. In addition, monoclonal antibodies specific for both the native and denatured forms of orf7a have been produced, allowing for the analysis of orf7a expression in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Further, we examined orf7a cellular trafficking by immunofluorescence microscopy, revealing predominant in tracellular retention within the Golgi network that is mediated by the transmembrane and short cytoplasmic tail of the protein.",

Based on the presence of four cysteine residues and a predicted secretory signal peptide, we expected that two disulfide bonds would be required for proper folding of the orf7a ectodomain. Indeed, the bacterially expressed recombinant protein proved insoluble. It was therefore re cov ered from inclusion bodies, denatured in guanidine hydrochloride, and then oxidatively refolded by rapid dilution. The resulting soluble protein was purified on size exclusion chromatography eluting at \u223c9 kDa, the correct calibrated molecular weight expected for the compactly folded monomer. We verified the identity of the orf7a ectodomain fragment by electrospray mass spectrometry (see Experimental Procedures). The observed mass is consistent with two disulfide bonds in the refolded molecule. The protein runs as a single spe cies on native PAGE and is stable in solution at 10 mg/ml over a period of several weeks.",

We hoped to gain insight into the potential function of orf7a by investigating the structural relationships between orf7a and other well-characterized proteins. Crystallization screening of the refolded orf7a protein yielded diffraction-quality hexagonal crystals belonging to space group P31 (a = b = 37.10 \u00c5, c = 55.33 \u00c5), which grew over a 3 day period in hanging drops to an approximate size of 0.2 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 mm. Initial phasing was accomplished by multiple isomor phous replacement (MIR) using data collected from three different Pt heavy atom derivatives (Table 1). The resulting electron density maps were readily interpretable (Figure 1A). An initial model, spanning residues 1\u201367 without a main chain break, was obtained directly from experimental phase using the autobuild feature of ARP/wARP (Morris et al., 2003). Further refinement was carried out in CNS with only minor model building required in O (Jones et al., 1991). The final model has excellent geometry, with 94.8% of all residues residing in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and the remaining 5.2% in the additionally allowed region as defined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). There are no residues in the disallowed or generously allowed regions. The final model has an Rwork of 22.3% to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution, with an Rfree of 27.5%.",

Strand A, instead of running antiparallel to strand B, has switched sheets and lies parallel to strand G. Like many C1-type Ig domains, both the C\u2032 and C\u2033 strands are absent. In addition, the C and D strands are both very short: the C strand is only 4 amino acids in length, while the D strand is just 3 residues long.

Neither occurs in the typical position occupied by the Ig-superfamily canonical disulfide (i.e., connecting the B and F strands).

The two most similar structures identified were the N-terminal domain of the human intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2) (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 1ZXQ, fragment 1\u201385, rmsd of 2.3 \u00c5 for 55 aligned residues, with 6% sequence identity) and the N-terminal domain of the human interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) (PDB ID 1IRA, fragment 1\u201394, rmsd of 2.0 \u00c5 for 46 aligned residues, with 11% sequence identity). Both structures are considered examples of I-set Ig domains as defined by SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995). Comparisons of orf7a with 55 additional members of the Ig superfamily identified by Dali revealed sequence identities ranging from 2% to 16% for aligned core residues, consistent with our failure to predict an Ig-like fold from the primary sequence alone. Also, compared with most Ig folds, the orf7a luminal domain is extremely small, consisting of only 65 amino acids. For comparison, the average length of an I-set domain in HOMSTRAD (Mizuguchi et al., 1998) is 98 amino acids. In addition to the short C and D strands, the membrane-distal B-C and F-G loops are also comparatively short. These differences are best seen in the structure-based alignment of the I-set domains with orf7a (Figure 1D).",

Recombinant soluble-refolded orf7a protein was used to immunize mice. Solid-phase ELISA identified 24 hybridomas producing mAb specific for the refolded protein. These were characterized in cell staining, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation assays (Table 2A). To prove that the IgG2b isotype clone 2E11 was specific for native orf7a, immunoprecipitation studies were performed using lysate from SARS-CoV-infected cells. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01 for 48 hr in accordance with the rules and regulations of Washington University and the \u201cLaboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with SARS-CoV\u201d as put forward by the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All manipulation of infectious samples took place in a BSL-3 biological safety facility. The infected cells were washed, solubilized in 1.0% Triton X-100, and immune complexes were recovered on protein A Sepharose. As expected, the 2E11 clone immunoprecipitated a single band of \u223c12 kDa. This protein was identified as orf7a by N-terminal sequencing (Table 2B). An identical sequence was obtained using lysate from 293T cells transfected with an orf7a cDNA. In both cases, the predicted 15 amino acid signal peptide (MKIILFLTLIVFTSC) of orf7a had been removed, presumably by signal peptidase cleavage. These results and the inability of 2E11 to recognize denatured (boiled-reduced) recombinant orf7a protein on Western blot support the conclusion that 2E11 is specific for orf7a in its natively expressed form. The ability of the conformation-dependent 2E11 mAb (raised against recombinant, refolded orf7a) to immunoprecipitate orf7a protein from SARS-CoV-infected cells strongly suggests that the conformation of the refolded and natively expressed proteins is similar if not identical. Final confirmation of this awaits the development of assays for the as yet unknown function of orf7a.",

A much weaker association was seen with the ER marker calnexin (Galvin et al., 1992).

Not surprisingly, transfer of the orf7a cytoplasmic tail was insufficient to confer intracellular retention on the cell-surface protein CD4 (Figure 4A, compare the first two panels). In contrast, transfer of both the orf7a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (26 amino acids) resulted in an increase in the amount of CD4 marker protein retained in the Golgi, as seen by comparing the colocalization of this chimeric construct with Golgin 97 (Figure 4B). However, localization of the CD4/orf7a TM tail construct was not as tight as that seen for orf7a alone, suggesting that residues in the orf7a stalk or luminal domain may also contribute to orf7a intracellular targeting. This situation, where residues outside the transmembrane domain help to fine-tune localization within the Golgi, has been observed for other membrane bound Golgi-resident proteins (Burke et al., 1994). Still, the dramatic difference between the CD4/orf7a TM tail and the CD4-GFP localizations indicates that the targeting signal exists primarily within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail.",

            "text": "Our structural studies of the orf7a luminal domain have established that it adopts an extremely compact Ig-like \u03b2 sandwich fold topology, despite an absence of significant sequence similarity to other members of the Ig superfamily. This common structural fold occurs in a wide variety of proteins, where it performs a diverse set of functions. For example, the fold is found in proteins of the extracellular matrix, muscle proteins, proteins of the immune system, cell-surface receptors, enzymes, transcription factors, and a wide variety of viral proteins (Clarke et al., 1999). An automated comparison of the luminal domain against 189 active site templates revealed no obvious enzymatic sites (Watson et al., 2003). Further, comparison of the structure with Ig superfamily members did not reveal any obvious conserved functional regions. As a result, we find it difficult to draw conclusions about the function of orf7a from the structure alone. Still, some features are worth noting. Because of the unusual disulfide-bonding pattern, the two \u03b2 sheets bow away from each other in the middle. This separation allows the formation of a deep hydrophobic pocket near the middle of the A strand. In most Ig folds, the B strand hydrogen bonds with the A strand. In orf7a, the peptide backbone of the B strand is free and passes close to the deep hydrophobic A pocket (Figure 5B). Therefore, it may be possible for a peptide strand from another protein to hydrogen bond with the B strand while inserting a side chain into the A pocket. Similar examples of donor-strand binding have been observed in the assembly of bacterial Ig-superfamily chaperones (Sauer et al., 2002). Second, there exists a deep groove on the backside of the orf7a molecule, formed between the C-D and E-F loops. Interestingly, one of the few reported sites of polymorphism (His47-Asn47) occurs along this groove and may represent an adaptation to accommodate a binding partner or ligand.",

Transfer of the orf7a cytoplasmic tail alone onto CD4 (CD4/orf7a-tail-GFP fusion) was unable to prevent surface expression of the marker protein. We also found that residues Lys103 and Lys105 of the orf7a cytoplasmic tail are required for efficient exit from the ER. Several interpretations exist for the higher steady-state ER retention of the Lys minus mutant. First, the charged Lys residues could serve as a stop-transfer sequence for translocation of the transmembrane domain. Their substitution to smaller nonpolar Ala residues may disrupt the conformation of the transmembrane domain or shift its position within the lipid bilayer enough to destroy recognition of an export signal. At this time, it is unclear what causes cargo to collect in nascent COPII vesicles (LaPointe et al., 2004); therefore, it remains possible that the Lys-Arg-Lys sequence is recognized directly. Regardless, our data indicate that the charged Lys residues are important for exit of orf7a from the ER.",

It is well established that the coronavirus E molecule is held in the Golgi by a signal located in its cytoplasmic tail (Corse and Machamer, 2002). Little primary sequence homology exists between the E proteins of the three coronavirus groups. Therefore, the exact trafficking determinant being recognized remains unclear. Still, because the E signal occurs outside the transmembrane region, it is most likely different from the orf7a signal. A second type of Golgi targeting signal occurs in the first transmembrane domain of the coronavirus M protein (Klum per man et al., 1994). Specifically, four polar residues that line up on one face of a predicted \u03b1 helix appear to be critical for the retention of M in the Golgi complex (Machamer et al., 1993). Here, the lack of polar transmembrane residues and different membrane topology suggest that the orf7a signal operates differently. Several single-stranded RNA viruses bud into the Golgi. For many of these, the principle glycoprotein component of the envelope consists of a heterodimeric complex of two single-pass transmembrane proteins. In almost every case, the Golgi targeting signal maps to the transmembrane domain and adjacent carboxy-terminal residues of one chain of the heterodimer. Examples of this type include the rubella virus envelope protein E2 (Hobman et al., 1995) and the envelope proteins from probably all members of the Bunyaviridae family (Bupp et al., 1996, Shi and Elliott, 2002). No detectable sequence homology exists among these regions, and it is likely that they are conformational in character, making it difficult to determine their relationship to the orf7a signal.",

            "text": "Why does orf7a contain an intracellular targeting signal? Coronaviruses acquire their membrane envelope by budding into the lumen of an ER to Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Klumperman et al., 1994, Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994). Three or four viral proteins incorporate into this envelope, by far the most abundant being the M protein. In cells forced to express M by cDNA transfection, a small amount of E is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles (Bos et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1996). It is still unclear what makes the M and E proteins gather in the ERGIC during infection (Lontok et al., 2004). When expressed individually, both move past the virus-assembly site (Corse and Machamer, 2002, Swift and Machamer, 1991). Two other coronavirus proteins integrate into the budding membrane: the S protein and, in the subset of coronaviruses that express it, the hemagglutinin\u2013esterase (HE) protein. Both localize to the pre-Golgi by forming specific interactions with M (Nguyen and Hogue, 1998). If SARS-CoV buds into the ERGIC as other coronaviruses do, then our data indicate that orf7a traffics through the budding compartment. It is conceivable that orf7a may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoV. In support of this idea, Tan et al. have presented coimmunoprecipitation data suggesting an interaction between orf7a and the product of another SARS-CoV accessory gene, ORF3a, a protein which in turn interacts with the structural proteins M, E, and S (Tan et al., 2004). Alternatively, orf7a may itself be packaged into virions, possibly to serve as a secondary attachment protein in a manner analogous to HE. So far, studies aimed at identifying the structural proteins of the SARS-CoV virion have failed to detect orf7a (Krokhin et al., 2003, Ying et al., 2004), although it is worth noting that these methods also have failed to detect the virion-associated E protein. We tested whether our anti-orf7a monoclonal antibodies could block the production of virus or its cytopathic effects in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. However, no neutralization effect was observed (data not shown).",

            "text": "What other functions could orf7a serve within the context of the ER/Golgi network? A significant number of viral accessory proteins have been found to be critical for the evasion of host-mediated immunity, interfering with diverse processes, including apoptosis, complement activation, cytokine signaling, and innate and adaptive immune surveillance (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000, Ploegh, 1998). While many of these proteins act at the plasma membrane or are secreted from infected cells, others have been found to operate within the secretory pathway, where they downregulate a variety of cell surface receptors, including signaling, co stimulatory, and adhesion molecules. For example, several viral accessory proteins have evolved to specifically prevent activation of NK or CD8 T cells by interfering with classical and nonclassical MHC function within ER and/or Golgi compartments (Orange et al., 2002). The murine cytomegalovirus m152 protein blocks surface expression of MHC class I as well as ligands of NKG2D by sequestering them in the ERGIC (Lodoen et al., 2003, Ziegler et al., 1997). The human cytomegalovirus US2 and US11 proteins, which are both like orf7a (type I transmembrane proteins that adopt Ig-like folds [Gewurz et al., 2001] ), catalyze the dislocation of MHC class I molecules from ER to cytosol; this dislocation results in its rapid degradation (Lilley and Ploegh, 2004, Ye et al., 2004 ). The bovine papillomavirus E5 protein retains MHC class I molecules in the Golgi and prevents their transport to the cell surface (Marchetti et al., 2002 ). RNA viruses can also en code MHC subversion proteins. For example, HIV-1 uses Nef to selectively downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B (Cohen et al., 1999 ). To see whether orf7a might have an analogous immunomodulatory function, we examined 293T cells transiently transfected with orf7a by flow cytometry. Our preliminary experiments indicated that orf7a expression does not result in significant loss of HLA-A expression (data not shown). The possible interference of orf7a with other immune surveillance mechanisms is currently under investigation.",

As expected, the spike protein was clearly present at the surface of the SARS-CoV-infected but not mock-infected cells ([A] and [B]). Incubation with the anti-orf7a monoclonal antibody 2E11 demonstrated only limited cell-surface expression of orf7a. An intracellular pool of orf7a was clearly evident after saponin permeabilization ([E] and [F]). The anti-SARS antibody is a mixture of hybridoma supernatants specific for SARS proteins and found to primarily recognize the S protein by Western blotting (a gift of Larry Anderson, CDC). Intracellular retention of orf7a does not require other viral proteins. When an orf7a cDNA is used to transiently transfect 293T cells, very little orf7a can be detected at the cell surface using 2E11 (G). Again, saponin pretreatment allowed staining of the intracellular orf7a (H). Addition of a C-terminal GFP tag did not significantly alter this intracellular distribution. A good colocalization was observed between orf7a staining (red) and GFP fluorescence (green) in this transfectant ([I] and [J]).
