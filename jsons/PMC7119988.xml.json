For RT-PCR, the total RNA in tissues or cells can be extracted and the mRNA in it, as template, is reverse transcribed into cDNA by using Oligo (dT) or random primer and reverse transcriptase. The cDNA is then used as template for PCR amplification to obtain the expression of target gene or detected gene. RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific, which shortens the period time consumed in detection. It is a practical way for early rapid diagnosis of influenza.
