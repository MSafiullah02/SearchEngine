The physician's obligations to avoid harm, act in the patient's best interests, and respect the value of each individual require thoughtful balancing of likely burdens and possible benefits of this (and any) intervention. For some patients (with or without COVID-19), the likelihood of harm is so high and that of benefit so low that resuscitation is not clinically indicated. A blanket approach, however, is not consistent with an individualized, evidence-based, clinical assessment. Clinician health and safety also require attention. Clinicians should not be asked to participate in resuscitation efforts that are not clinically indicated, and policies and procedures should help ensure best practices and availability of personal protective equipment.",

Appreciation of the value and dignity of every individual, the humility necessary for making triage decisions, and acknowledgment of social factors that limit opportunity for many persons strongly argue against using social worth or its perception to determine resource allocation.",

Moreover, the authors cite an article (5) on organ transplantation that they say provides a precedent for rationing based on life-years, but it is misapplied. That article (5) considered age to determine short-term survival of 1 year (that is, clinical effectiveness of the intervention), not longer survival, life expectancy, or life-years. Also, the contexts are very different. Older patients once were believed to be unlikely to survive the procedure itself; they were not denied a transplant because they had too few life-years to be deserving. In fact, transplants for recipients aged 65 years and older have increased dramatically for\nlungs\u2014and overall\u2014over the past 30 years (6).",

Boosting production of personal protective equipment and ventilators and mobilizing retired health professionals can bridge projected resource gaps.
