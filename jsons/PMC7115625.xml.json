IBV is an enveloped RNA virus and its virus particle morphology is spherical with a 80\u2013120 nm in diameter.

Homotypic interactions among M proteins and interactions with the S protein and the other structural proteins are required for virus particle formation. Thus, the M protein plays an important role in coronavirus assembly [1], [2], [3], [4]. IBV M protein is found in the cis-Golgi network and cis-Golgi complex when expressed alone [5], and cannot be released into the supernatant unless IBV E is present [6]. In contrast, studies of other coronaviruses suggested that the M protein was observed in the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells when expressed alone [7], and can form sedimentable particles and release from infected cells [8].",

Ho et al. showed that M and E proteins were required for the assembly of human SARS coronavirus-like particles in Sf21 cells [22]; but M, E and N proteins were required for the formation of SARS-CoV VLP as demonstrated by Siu et al. in Vero E6 cells [23] and Nakauchi et al. in 293T cells [24]. Liu et al. found that influenza M1 protein and SARS S protein could assemble chimeric SARS-CoV VLPs in Sf9 cell [25]. For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), Vennema et al. showed that transfection of OST7-1 cells with vaccinia virus encoding M and E proteins resulted in the VLP formation [26]. These reports strongly suggested that M and E were the minimal molecules required for the coronavirus-like particles regardless of virus types and cell lines used in the studies. In contrast, our results showed for the first time that IBV M and S proteins were efficient assembled into VLPs in Sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding M and S proteins. This might not be a complete surprise. As for IBV, Corse and Machamer reported that while the presence of E protein could enhance the release of M proteins in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants, M protein alone was capable of being released in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants in OST7-1cells with a vaccinia-T7 polymerase expression system [18, particularly Fig. 6]. In addition, the native envelope trimeric S glycoprotein is not necessary for particle formation but is incorporated into VLPs when present [22]; and incorporation of spikes into coronavirus particles is mediated by the S protein's carboxy-terminal domain and effected by interactions between the S protein and the M protein [16]. The showing of IBV VLPs formed by M and S proteins demonstrated a simple strategy for production of coronavirus-like particles for coronaviruses.",

For the cellular immune responses, the IFN-r and IL-4 were detected using the ELIspot assay. The results revealed that IBV VLPs elicited high levels of IFN-r and IL-4, but the inactivated H120 vaccine only induced IL-4 at a significantly lower level (P\n < 0.01). The results demonstrated that IBV VLPs could elicit both Th1- and Th2-type cellular immune responses, but inactivated H120 only stimulated Th2-type cellular immune response. Previous studies showed that VLPs could elicit more effective antibody responses than proteins in their non-native forms [27], [28]. The reason for the results that the inactivated H120 vaccine used in this study had slightly lower neutralizing antibody titers and a significantly lower level of cellular immune responses than VLPs might be that a portion of S molecules lost their native forms during inactivation with formalin. Our results demonstrated that the IBV VLPs mimic the conformation and organization of authentic native viruses, and their immunogenicities were reserved.",
