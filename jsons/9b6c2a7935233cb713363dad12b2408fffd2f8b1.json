When cross-sectioned, smooth muscle cells appeared plump, and the cytoplasm varied in staining intensity. The myenteric plexus appeared normal. In sections stained with Gomori and Masson's trichrome, the smooth muscle fascicles were separated by a thin fibrous stroma of reticulin and, at times, dense collagen fibers.

On sectioning, the mass was composed of white friable tissue, and the lumen was nearly completely obstructed. The mesenteric lymph nodes were notably enlarged. Histologically, the mass had the infiltrative proliferation of a monotonous population of immunoblast-like lymphocytes that caused the complete disruption of the intestinal architecture. The mucosa, the submucosa, and the muscular layer were severely affected. Marked hypertrophy of the smooth muscle, morphologically similar to that observed in the first two cats, was present proximal to the mass and was associated with mild submucosal lymphoid infiltrate. The mesenteric lymph nodes had a complete loss of their architecture associated with a lymphomatous infiltration of the capsule and perinodal tissues. The diagnosis was diffuse, immunoblastic, high-grade, alimentary lymphoma and secondary intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy. Case 4 had a well-delineated, firm swelling of the intestine with proximal thickening and rigidity of the bowel. The intestinal serosal surface was reddened, and there were some fibrin strands. On sectioning, the intestinal wall of the affected area was discolored purple and contained a foreign body (portion of a rubber tube, 10 mm long, and 10 mm in diameter). The mucosal surface was discolored. Histologically, there was necrosis of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis corresponding to the area of the foreign body. Peripherally, there was intense infiltration of neutrophils, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, and edema of the submucosa, which were coherent with active granulation tissue demarcating the necrosis. The thickened bowel proximal to the foreign body had marked hypertrophy of smooth muscle.
