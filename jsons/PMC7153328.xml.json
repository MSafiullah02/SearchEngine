Furthermore, in some countries, antimicrobials are used in animal breeding as growth promoters (Fl\u00f3rez et al., 2017). Antimicrobial agents are one of the medicinal innovations of humanity that allows us to cure both human and veterinary infections of microbes. Since the 1940s, several antimicrobials have contributed significantly for prevention, restriction, and cure of contagious diseases in animals. Low- and subtherapeutic antimicrobial dosage plays a very important role in improving feeding proficiency, stimulating animal growth, disease avoidance, and control (Magouras et al., 2017).",

            "text": "There are four ways in which substances expressing antimicrobial activity are used in animals. Therapeutic usage of antimicrobials is considered to prevent existing microbial diseases, usually used for individual animal cure. It involves testing of each infected animal, which involves laboratory examination, determining the microbes and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Antimicrobials are administered either orally or via inoculation only to animals showing symptoms of that particular illness. The dosage that is injected is related to both the type of animal and the severity of illness. Metaphylaxis includes prior medication to the whole animal group that might lessen the numbers of sick or deceased animals. It might also reduce the antimicrobial dosage required for the treatment of huge numbers of the symptomatically sick populace, therefore treatment expenses are also reduced. Antimicrobial prophylactic application exists for individual and animal groups. It is generally used for operative prophylaxis in animals. In cattle, the prophylactic intramammary injection of antimicrobial agents at the end of the suckling phase prevents mastitis. In swine and cattle husbandry, antimicrobial prophylactic usage occurs at significant time periods like weaning. Antimicrobial prophylaxis usage is critical in numerous pigs and cattle herds. In its absence, continual breathing and enteral illnesses in the byres and piggeries cannot be effectively controlled. Growth promotion also involves antimicrobial usage in food animals. Antimicrobial growth promoters were first endorsed in the mid-1950s.It was revealed that small and subtherapeutic dosage of antimicrobials like penicillin, procaine, and tetracycline (1/10 to 1/100 the quantity of curative dosage), given to animals in food, could increase the food/mass ratio for chickens, pigs, and cows. All substances used to stimulate growth are certified on the base of European Union (EU)\u2013wide rules (guideline 70-524-EWG). These regulations narrate the usage of the particular substances in various animals in accordance to animal's age, maximal and minimal antimicrobial consumption in mg/kg food. Formerly, just four substances were permitted in the EU, having certified growth promotions with antimicrobial functions. These were flavophospholipol, monensin\u2013Na, salinomycin\u2013Na, and avilamycin. In 1996, the glycopeptide-avoparcin usage as a growth promoter was prohibited. Cross-resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin; teicoplanin), macrolides (erythromycin; clarithromycin) and streptogramins (dalfo/quinupristin) was the major reason for banning them (Ungemach, 1999, Schwarz et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The widespread and inappropriate utilization of antimicrobials in food animals are contributing factors for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Diseases have become untreatable due to the resistance against therapeutic agents. This also poses a risk to public health through potential transfer of resistance genes to human pathogens. Both pathogenic and commensal microbes are exposed to antimicrobials and in response AMR develops. It has been detected that microbes develop resistance by any of the four mechanisms: through drug inactivation or its modification, alteration in the drug target site, modification in the metabolic pathways to overcome drug effects, and by minimizing entry and promoting active efflux of the drugs (Sharma et al., 2018). Microbes can develop antimicrobial resistance by mutating existing genes (vertical gene transfer) or by obtaining new genes from the environment, other spp., or strains (horizontal gene transfer) (Jeters et al., 2009). Resistance between bacterial spp. has been seen through antibiotic-resistant genes and includes among the primary genes leading to AMR: blaTEM genes for the antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin) (Bailey et al., 2011); van for glycopeptides (avoparcin, vancomycin) (Leavis et al., 2003); erm gene cluster for macrolides (erythromycin, tylosin, tilmicosin, kitasamycin, oleandomycin) (Ramos et al., 2012); vatD, vatE, erm gene cluster, satA for streptogramins (virginiamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin) (Ramos et al., 2012); sul genes for sulfonamides (sulfisoxazole, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine) (Cain and Hall, 2012); tet genes for tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline) (Ramos et al., 2012); rgpA\u2013F, mbrA\u2013D genes for polypeptides (bacitracin) (Cain and Hall, 2012); and cmaA, floR, fexA, fexB, cfr, cat gene for amphenicols (chloramphenicol (Cain and Hall, 2012).",

At the present time, China and Brazil are among the large-scale consumers of antimicrobials. But these are not the countries with the rapid projected increases in antimicrobial consumption. This shows that these two countries have already begun moving toward more escalated livestock production systems using antimicrobials to sustain animal health and increase productivity.

            "text": "Pig weaning is a slow progression that starts at almost 3 months of age and shows the transfer of piglet dependence from lactate to other foodstuffs. But in a majority of developed nations pig weaning is a rapid progression taking place earlier in life, at the age of 19\u201325 days. It is frequently related to increased risk of stomach dysfunction and dysentery. Pigs eating feed containing antimicrobials showed no symptoms of gastrointestinal impairment at any point, while naturally lactate controls developed dysentery (Li et al., 2013). With antimicrobial usage, there was high day-by-day mass growth in contrast with lactate controls. The streptomycin repeatedly used for pig weaning from delivery to 28 days of age resulted in 8% mass increase compared to natural pigs of 56 days weaning time. Similarly, Aureomycin, Terramycin (oxytetracycline), and penicillin enhanced the swine growth by 10% (Li, 2017). Antimicrobials used are listed in Table 4.1\n. Specifically, in chicken and pig farming, antimicrobial usage has become a basic part of animal feeds. In the United States, more than a thousand experiments were performed from 1950 to 85. From the results, it was observed that antimicrobials were the efficient agents for feed and growth improvement in adult pigs, as well as the whole growth-finished phase, and reduced death and disease conditions mostly in juvenile pigs. The death rate can be doubly high in the farm environment compared to research locations where the amenities are usually clean, the disease load is less, and the atmosphere is less traumatic (Luecke et al., 1951). The advantageous effects of antimicrobials on body mass growth were accompanied by improved feed consumption effectiveness, enhanced desire for food, and extra common exterior of the fur hair and hide. Thus, antimicrobials have been used as a feed preservative globally for many years. The extent of the improvement in growth rate is based on the type of antimicrobial, nourishment stage, farm atmosphere, and swine conditions (Cromwell, 2002).",

In these countries they are considered as minor spp. They are food-producing animals that do not have a large economic footprint. They are not often targeted for drug development and approval. Additionally, the market for drug use is small, resulting in limited financial commitments from pharmaceutical companies. With sparse clinical data generated in North America supporting drug use, it is difficult to license drugs for use in these species. Veterinarians and sheep producers therefore have a limited selection of licensed drugs (Navarre and Marley, 2006). It is thought that much of the drugs used is extra-label drug use (ELDU), which means usage is not in accordance with information mentioned on its label, package insert, or product monograph. Penicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol are extra-label drugs generally used (Fajt, 2001).Antimicrobials used in goats and sheep are listed in Table 4.2\n.",

China (6.7 million), Brazil (9.6 million), the United States (US) (11.4 million), the 28 member countries of the European Union (7.5 million), and India (4.5 million) are the fundamental cattle-producing countries in the world, resulting in an excess of one billion cattle population in 2015 (Ali et al., 2016). Cattle raising at massive levels normally involves moving animals from cow-calf systems (a permanent herd used to produce young beef), to back grounding (postweaning intermediate feeding, normally forage-based diets) and feedlot (a building where livestock are fattened for market, usually with high-energy grain-based diets). For the treatment and prevention of diseases in cattle and cows, antimicrobials can be administered in live cattle at any developmental stage (Podberscek, 2009). In the husbandry environment, cattle can be more prone to endemic pathogens. These pathogens are normally neglected, causing severe damage to animal health, and affecting herd growth and farm productivity. The chances of transmission of diseases cause significant economic pressure for antimicrobial use against bovine infectious diseases (Radostits et al., 2006, Van Epps and Blaney, 2016). A number of the antimicrobials being used for the treatment of infections in cattle and cows are mentioned in Table 4.3\n. Commonly used antimicrobials for treatment of diseases in cattle and cows are trimethoprim/sulfonamides, oxytetracycline, benzylpenicillin, and polymyxin B (The Finnish Food Safety Authority, 2018).",

Recently, there has been an interest in meat from alternative sources, other than bovine, swine, and poultry. The main producers of horsemeat are China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia, and Argentina, while Mongolia, Switzerland, Italy, Kazakhstan, and Russia are the largest consumers (Vanegas Azuero and Guti\u00e9rrez, 2016). It is very challenging to estimate the antimicrobial use in horses. Deciding the volume of antimicrobials to be used in horses in most countries is difficult, if not impossible. As a result, antimicrobials administration strategy and estimation of antimicrobials usage is difficult. There are insufficient answers to the questions of \u201chow much\u201d and \u201chow are\u201d these antimicrobials are administered in horses (Weese, 2015). The major spp. of bacteria detected at the onset of instillation were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equi subsp. Zooepidemicus, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus vitulinus, Enterobacter agglomerans, Flavimonas oryzihabitans and Staphylococcus sciuri (HIDAKA et al., 2015). Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, or amikacin) are concentration-dependent bactericidal drugs, therefore the higher the drug concentration, the greater the bactericidal effect use against skin, subcutaneous tissue, eye, and urinary tract infections in horses (Papich, 2001, Williams and Pinard, 2013, Carapetis et al., 2017). Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, potentiated aminopenicillins, and cephalosporins are slowly bactericidal and used for the treatment of urinary tract, skin, subcutaneous tissue, and respiratory tract infections (Papich, 2001, Gordon and Radtke, 2017b, Wilson, 2001).

Chicken is the most frequently farmed spp., producing more than 90 billion tons of chicken meat per year (Agyare et al., 2018). Most countries use a wide variety of antimicrobials to grow poultry (Sahoo et al., 2010, Landers et al., 2012, Boamah et al., 2016). In order to meet the demand, initially scientists began to look for ways to produce more meat at a relatively cheaper level, resulting in the use of antimicrobial agents (Dibner and Richards, 2005). Poultry diseases always involve an entire flock falling ill, which prompts a decision on administration of medicine that must be taken. Several factors affect the decision and the most important of them is the cause behind the disease. Before initiating the treatment, dead or euthanized broilers, chickens, and turkeys, samples of their organs or blood or bacterial samples must be sent for testing to obtain diagnosis. Conducting a field diagnosis is difficult, and antimicrobials are all too often prescribed for precautionary reasons. Phenoxymethyl-penicillin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim/sulfonamides are mostly used for treating gastrointestinal tract infections, arthritis, and other systemic infections (The Finnish Food Safety Authority, 2018).

In these countries, the idea of consuming a cat or a dog is considered as heinous and amoral, as in United Kingdom and United States cats and dogs are mainly kept as pet animals. Regions where there are records of dog eating include Southeast Asia and Indochina, North and Central America, parts of Africa, and the islands of the Pacific. During the Stone Age and Bronze Age, dog eating was apparently also common in Europe. Still less has been written or discovered about the eating of domestic cats. It has a briefer history than dog eating and the level of consumption of cat meat is also comparatively low. Nowadays, the consumption of dogs and cats still occurs in a number of countries, including China, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In 1996, it was proclaimed that dog meat was still being eaten in parts of Eastern Switzerland. It has been estimated that in Asia, around 13\u201316 million dogs and 4 million cats are eaten each year (Podberscek, 2009). A number of the antimicrobials being used for the treatment of infections in cats and dogs are mentioned in Table 4.6\n. Commonly used antimicrobials in dogs and cats are beta lactams (particularly cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in dogs).

It has become one of the chief contagious illnesses that cause danger in the rabbit farming industry (Milon et al., 1999). In commercial farming, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a lactate female can produce a total quantity of milk corresponding to her body mass via four to five pairs of mammae in 35 days (Rosell and de la Fuente, 2018). This attempt predisposes to diseases that affect the mammae throughout lactation. It includes mostly mammary gland microbial diseases like mastitis. In rabbits, diseases by Pasteurella multocida are also widespread. Pasteurellosis in them present rhinitis with blood-stained nasal discharge, pneumonia, serous otitis media, pyometra, orchitis, pustule, and septic infection (Langan et al., 2000). Respiratory anthrax is another lethal illness in rabbits in the absence of earlier treatment with antimicrobials. Rabbits are extremely vulnerable to diseases caused by Bacillus anthracis spores via intranasal instillation; they succumb within 2\u20134 days post illness. For the prevention and cure of diseases, different antimicrobials including penicillin, ampicillin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, rifampin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, amoxicillin, clindamycin, and meropenem are used (Li et al., 2013).

To meet the protein demands of growing global populace, aquaculture is considered to be the fastest protein food production sector and accounts for 50% of overall food supply (Okocha et al., 2018). Aquaculture include fishes, catfish , Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, tilapia, Pacific oyster, Eastern oyster, Pacific white shrimp, yellow perch, and bluegill sunfish, mollusks, etc. Nowadays, freshwater pool aquaculture farming major product is finfish. For freshwater farming, diverse sources of water supply like containers, pools, streams, and channels are used. Aquaculture farming generally consists of cage culture for sea finfish and freshwater pools or brackish water for crustaceans (Hall, 2011). Whilst many cages and pools benefit from natural water exchange used for provision of oxygen and waste disposal, simultaneously the fish and crustaceans are exposed to illness-causing microbes present in the water. To improve aquaculture farming, new techniques have been developed including closed recirculating aquaculture systems that decrease the risk of disease vectors and wastes (Martins et al., 2010).\n",

Asia dominates this production, accounting for 89% by capacity and 79% by cost; among Asian countries, China is the leading producer (32.7 million tons in 2008). The speedy development in this region is due to different factors that include preexisting aquaculture practices, populace and financial development, relaxed regulatory framework, and expanding export opportunities. Countries contributing more in aquaculture than wild-caught fish are China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Egypt. The top 15 aquatic culture\u2013producing countries in 2010 by percentage of total worldwide production appear in Fig. 4. 2\n.

Around 1985, aquaculture was the only animal producing industry globally. Prior to this era, aquaculture was considered as a noncommercial matter, a traditional way of life and a source of nourishment for its producers. Increased demand for a healthy choice of protein, enriched seafood feed production, reduction of numbers of wild fish, and advanced farming techniques have led to high-density fish production in recent years (Cole et al., 2009). Up to 80% reduction in global finfish and shellfish stocks (collectively as \u201cfish\u201d) occur in order to provide food to increasing human population day by day (Pauly and Zeller, 2016, Pauly and Zeller, 2017). Due to its capability to provide sensible, secure, reliable, and alternative food producing systems, our dependency on aquaculture has increased to reduce this extinction. Aquaculture systems produced 70.5 million tons of food fish and 26.1 million tons of aquatic algae in 2014. According to aquaculture production figures, a significant contribution of aquaculture resulted in increasing the total fish consumption from 1962 to 2002 from 5% to 49%, respectively. It is predicted that the production of aquaculture in Europe will reach 4 million tons by 2030 (Pauly and Zeller, 2017). This globally increased production of aquaculture has resulted in new and improved farmed spp., more than 580 species in total (consisting of 362 finfish and 62 crustaceans), with a wide range of growth and maximum production conditions (Pauly and Zeller, 2017, Naylor et al., 2000).",

A broad variety of compounds are used in aquaculture farming that include antimicrobials, pesticides, hormones, anesthetics, a variety of pigments, mineral deposits and vitamins, though not all of them are antimicrobials. As with livestock animal production, antimicrobials are also used in aquaculture in attempting to cure ailments (Burka et al., 1997). Antimicrobial treatment patterns also differ among countries and among individual aquaculture farming within the same country. The most important reason to follow antimicrobial usage is to control contagious illnesses in breeding areas, to avert losses in farming; to limit the introduction of microbes to new facilities when larvae, fry, or brood stock are moved; to limit the disease spreading to natural fish via the reproduction sewage or when cultured fish are stocked out; and to avoid the strengthening of microbes previously widespread in a watershed (Phillips et al., 2004). There are inadequate statistics concerning antimicrobial usage in global aquaculture. For many of the farmed genuses, we are deficient in sufficient information regarding pharmacokinetics (Sapkota et al.) and pharmacodynamics of drug administration. The drugs available for the cure of widespread transmittable illnesses are becoming increasingly inadequate and costly and, in several situations, not available due to the emergence of drug resistance that is shocking and erases the previous 60 years\u2019 medicinal developments (Serrano, 2005). In aquaculture farming antimicrobials have been used predominantly for curative purposes and as prophylactic agents (Serrano, 2005, Shao, 2001). Drugs are rarely used as growth promoters in aquaculture farming. Prophylactic treatments when used are typically confined for breeding, the immature or larval stages of aquatic animal farming. Prophylactic usage is more typically found in lower-level farming units that can't afford or get access to the recommendation of veterinary professionals.",

Antimicrobials in aquaculture farming are delivered via feed medication, bioencapsulation, immersion baths, dip, flush, or in exceptional cases, intramuscularly or intraperitoneally (Smith et al., 2008). Feed medication is not completely digested by fish, and most of the time is inadequately digested and metabolized, with the result being that there is a continuous release of antimicrobials into the surroundings. Medicated feed also primarily affects the gut flora of fish (Navarrete et al., 2008). Consistent presentation to antimicrobials leads to the variety of resistant microbes and an increase in antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs) transfer. These circumstances eventually imply that the feces of feed-medicated fish are affluent in ARGs (Martinez and Baquero, 2000).",

In Ireland, Norway, and Scotland, marine enclosed aquaculture farming is mainly restricted to salmon, and marine bass and marine bream in Italy, Greece, and Spain. Recently, a rise in the tilapia and mullet farming have been observed in Egypt. The salmon production in Chile is continually affected by microbes such as bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses responsible for progression of illnesses, numerous of which resulted in the loss of millions of finfish and thus major farming loss (Asche et al., 2009). Over the last 30 years, the facultative intracellular bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis, causative agent of Salmonid Rickettsial Syndrome (SRS) consistently overwhelmed the salmon farming (Rozas and Enriquez, 2014). The bacterium is responsible for >80% of finfish deaths that happened due to contagious illnesses in the three chief fish group cultured in Chilean industry, i.e., Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon), Oncorhynchus kisutch (coho salmon), and O. mykiss (rainbow trout) (Makrinos and Bowden, 2017).

The mollusk parasitic illnesses are often intracellular (e.g., Bonamia ostreae) and no antimicrobials are available for cure.
