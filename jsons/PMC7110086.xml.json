Many commensal LABs are considered \u2018generally recognized as safe\u2019 (Adams & Marteau, 1995) and this represents an important advantage for their potential use as live therapeutic vehicles (Mercenier, 1999). Such approaches would be convenient in the mass treatment of farm animals and in particular in chicken breeding, a field facing huge infective emergencies (such as avian flu, with potential zoonotic risks) and where the cost of classic vaccinal procedures heavily influences the earnings of the farm.",

Studies on constitutive promoters to express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria or other antigens in L. reuteri strains have not yet been described. In previous reports, only nisin-inducible expression vectors were used to express GFP (Wu & Chung, 2006) or GFP:STLTB (a fusion protein between GFP and the heat-stable enterotoxin ST and heat-labile enterotoxin B LTB of the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, ETEC) (Wu & Chung, 2007) in L. reuteri strains. To induce a successful mucosal immune response in the host, both the amount and the persistence of the antigen are critical factors. In the study described by Wu & Chung, the GFP:STLTB protein secreted by their L. reuteri was expressed at a high level during 3 h after the L. reuteri had been induced by nisin and orally inoculated in mice, but after that, only a basal amount of protein was predicted to be produced, from the in vitro estimation. For this reason, the expression of antigens using constitutive promoters could be an effective alternative.",

The first sampling was performed by collecting crops from a commercial plant where a stock of fowls from a commercial breeder was under slaughtering. The second set of samples was obtained from an experimental facility where a stock of commercial pullet had been grown under standard conditions. All the chickens were sacrificed at the age of 8 weeks. Lactobacillus isolates were cultured in MRS broth and identified to the species level by PCR-ARDRA on the 16S\u201323S rRNA gene spacer region (Tilsala-Timisjarvi & Alatossava, 1997; Moreira et al., 2005).

Lactobacillus reuteri transformants were grown in MRS broth (including 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 erythromycin) or in a buffered MRS broth (containing 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 erythromycin) at 30 or 37 \u00b0C with or without aeration, in several combinations (P\u00e9rez-Arellano & P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez, 2003; Wu & Chung, 2006). Lactococcus lactis transformants were grown in GM17 broth containing 5 \u03bcg mL\u22121 erythromycin. The pellets of the GFP-expressing cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), from which 10 \u03bcL of the bacterial suspension was transferred onto slides. These smears were then directly observed by epifluorescence microscopy (TMD, Nikon) under an oil immersion objective. Subsequently, the Qubit\u2122 fluorometer, which is able to measure fluorochromes such as SyBR Green, was used to obtain a direct quantification of GFP fluorescence. Indeed, the excitation wavelength provided by the blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of the instruments has a peak around 480 nm and the emission of SyBr Green stains shows a maximum around 521 nm; these values are not far from those of EGFP, having the excitation peak at 488 nm and the emission peak at 510 nm. Even though the exact properties of the instrument and the composition of the kits for this fluorometer are not declared by the manufacturer, we demonstrated its ability to detect small amounts of GFP fluorescence, producing a linear and reliable response. Using the \u2018Quant-iT Protein Assay\u2019 program of the fluorometer, we generated a GFP fluorescence calibration curve including three different concentrations of a recombinant 6xHis-EGFP (0, 1 and 2 \u03bcg) as standards. Recombinant 6xHis tagged-EGFP was produced in E. coli DH5\u03b1 bearing the plasmid pQE-GFP and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. For each sample, similar amounts of GFP-expressing cells (measured as OD600 nm) were centrifuged at 1800 g for 5 min, washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of PBS and subjected to fluorimetric reading.",

The expression level of the three plasmids was assessed upon electroporation in L. lactis and L. reuteri DSM 20016T. Following the testing in the L. reuteri DSM 20016T reference strain, five different erythromycin-sensitive strains of L. reuteri isolated from chicken crops (H09, I09, N07, N09, and N10) were chosen for transformation trials. Transformed colonies were obtained from all the strains. I09 and N09 isolates were cultured in MRS at 37 \u00b0C, instead of H09, N07 and N10, which had their optimal growth condition in MRS at 40 \u00b0C. The GFP fluorescence was examined in all the recombinant bacteria. The fluorescence was initially observed in pelleted cells upon blue LED light (470 nm) looking through a green polyester filter (Lime#8, Lee filters) and by epifluorescence microscopy on unfixed cells. A high level of fluorescence was detectable in L. lactis/pTRKH3-ermGFP, while L. lactis transformed with pTRKH3-ldhGFP and pTRKH3-slpGFP showed a very low intensity. The fluorescence of pelleted L. lactis cells required a washing step with PBS to be detectable. Very particular conditions were needed to achieve optimal fluorescence in L. reuteri, as reported by P\u00e9rez-Arellano & P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez (2003) in Lactobacillus casei. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016T, L. reuteri N09 and I09 were grown in MRS medium under several combinations of the following culture conditions: incubation at 30 or 37 \u00b0C, unbuffered or buffered MRS medium, with or without aeration. No fluorescence could be detected when L. reuteri was grown in an unbuffered medium at 37 \u00b0C, either with or without aeration. Growth temperature and pH were the most important factors affecting the synthesis or the stability of the GFP protein, because in buffered medium at 30 \u00b0C, fluorescence was clearly visible (Fig. 1). In contrast with the results of Wu & Chung (2006), we found that aeration conditions barely influenced GFP expression, achieving similar results with or without aeration in L. reuteri strains (Fig. 2a). Concordant data were obtained by fluorimetry (Fig. 2b). In H09, N07 and N10 strains, fluorescence was clearly detectable when these isolates were grown in buffered MRS at 37 \u00b0C without aeration, due to their different optimal growth conditions (Fig. 1). As observed in our in vitro experiments, although GFP is considered as a suitable reporter to be used in bacteria, detection of this protein in vivo could be problematic due to the high rate of denaturation observed at low pH levels developed and tolerated by LAB during their growth. Actually, satisfactory fluorescence visualization in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus requires a neutralization step performed by washing the cells in a neutral phosphate buffer. Even though visible fluorescence can be recovered by the treatment, it is still unclear whether the totality of the protein can be renatured in this way or whether a part of it remains irreversibly \u2018switched off\u2019 following extended exposition to low pH levels. To overcome such potential problems in vivo, some alternative reporter proteins could be tested to replace EGFP in vivo, such as the red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp., which is more stable in acidic environments.",

To confirm this hypothesis and the possible active secretion of the processed GFP, a sample of bacterial lysate was analyzed together with the concentrated spent culture medium (Fig. 3).

The choice of promoters is one of the most important features to consider when expressing specific antigens in LABs to \u2018vaccinate\u2019 the host. Even if a high level of antigen synthesis is not always a prerequisite to elicit the host immunity, i.e. for antigens that are membrane associated or that show some insolubility or toxicity to bacterial cells (Mercenier et al., 2000), the failure in stimulating the production of antibodies in hosts may also be the result of the low level of expression of heterologous proteins in the recombinant LAB. This may be due to the absence of the specific inducer in the gastrointestinal tract of the host. Several studies (Grangette et al., 2001; Reveneau et al., 2002) have shown that the absolute level of the antigen produced by Lactobacillus vaccine strains is a key factor in determining the level of immune responses obtained, and that the addition of an antigen dose leads to an enhancement of the immune response.",
