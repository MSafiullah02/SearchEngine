Various studies have shown that the parasite is also common in German piglet production and that parasitological findings correlate with diarrhoea (Mathea, 1993; Otten et al., 1996; Ilieff, 1997; Meyer et al., 1999). However, these coccidia are often neglected as a primary pathogen since clinical findings are not specific and detection of oocysts can be difficult and is rarely attempted. Piglets with isosporosis develop diarrhoea of varying consistency, mostly at 7 to 15 days of age; overall depression and dehydration can occur. In particular, reduced weight gain and overall poor performance of infected animals are of economic importance, while death occurs only rarely (Sangster et al., 1978; Stuart et al., 1980; Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Lindsay, 1989; Driesen et al., 1993). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether field infections with I. suis are associated with pathomorphological changes in the gut that are related to the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea.",

Faecal samples were collected from 18 piglet production units in Eastern Westphalia with herd sizes between 20 and 320 sows and variable management practices. On some farms piglet diarrhoea was a health problem, while on others it occurred only sporadically. On each farm at least 10 litters, preferably those with diarrhoea, were examined between 5 and 28 days of age. Individual faecal samples were taken mostly rectally, from three to five piglets of each litter and pooled. For coproscopy a combined sedimentation\u2010flotation method was used. Two to three grams of faeces were suspended in tap water and sieved (mesh size: 250 \u03bcm) into a 100\u2010ml glass beaker. After 3 minutes of sedimentation the supernatant was discarded, and the sediment was transferred to a 10\u2010ml tube and centrifuged (400 \u00d7 g, 5 min). The supernatant was discarded again and the sediment was resuspended in sodium chloride/zinc chloride solution (specific gravity: 1.53 g/ml; Takla, 1985) with subsequent centrifugation as above. The tube was then filled with salt solution up to a convex meniscus. After 10 min of flotation the meniscus was lifted with a microscopical slide and examined microscopically (100 \u00d7 magnification). In samples of the necropsied piglets the numbers of oocysts per gram faeces (opg) were counted using a conventional McMaster technique.",

Animals were chosen according to their clinical symptoms and, in some cases, on the basis of positive results of coproscopy of the litter sample. Immediately before necropsy the piglets were killed by carbon dioxide fumigation or intracardial injection of sodium pentobarbital (EUTHA 77\u00ae, Essex Animal Health, Friesoythe, Germany) followed by necropsy, histological, parasitological and, for differential diagnosis, bacteriological and virological examinations. For histology samples were taken from the following locations: duodenum (pars descendens duodeni), cranial, medial and caudal jejunum, ileum, caecum (caudal third) and colon (flexura centralis). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formaline, embedded in paraffin, cut (3 \u03bcm thickness) and stained with haematoxilin\u2010eosin (HE). Coccidia stages were counted in 10 fields (400 \u00d7 magnification) and assigned to the developmental (sexual or asexual) stages. Microbiological examination was performed by direct cultivation on blood agar with subsequent subcultivation on MacConkey agar and finally further differentiation on endo\u2010agar. Salmonella were enriched in Preu\u00df liquid medium, and material was also transferred to liver bouillon to test for clostridia. In positive cases clostridia were differentiated further by toxin typing with a Bio\u2010X\u2010Enterotoxaemia ELISA kit (BioX, Brussels, Belgium). Using Bacillus subtilis as the test organism a test for antibiotic residues (three\u2010plate\u2010test) was carried out. Using a Slidex Rota\u2010Kit 2 (Bio M\u00e9rieux SA, Lyon, France) and, in parallel, cell culture (cell line MA\u2010104), rectal or colonic contents were tested for rotavirus. Freeze sections of the caudal jejunum and duodenum were investigated with direct immunofluorescence for the presence of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus or epizootic virus diarrhoe (EVD) virus.",

(1999) the results of the present study show that in Germany I. suis is widely distributed amongst young suckling piglets and that infection is associated with diarrhoea. In other studies, coccidia were also found in 60\u201380% of the farms investigated (Driesen et al., 1993; Eysker et al., 1994; Ilieff, 1997). The average litter infection rate lies in the range of those (36.3%) found in the Netherlands by Eysker et al. (1994). Higher (cumulative) infection rates of 53.8\u201362.2% were found when litters were examined several times in weekly intervals (Eysker et al., 1994; Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999). We found that the highest rates of infection of the litters was in the third week of age, which is in concordance with Otten et al. (1996). In contrast, Meyer et al. (1999) found that in large piglet production units with good management the prevalence increased until the fourth week, which Daugschies et al. (1999) put down to slower spread of the infection on farms with good hygiene management. According to Lindsay et al. (1992) and Otten et al. (1996) isosporosis can occur on any farm, independently of the size or management. However, we found that I. suis was regularly found in small to medium\u2010sized units and on farms with straw bedding. Additionally, the prevalence was negatively correlated with the percentage of perforated floor areas, perhaps due to less contact between the piglets and their faeces, which is in concordance with the results of other authors (Sayd and Kawazone, 1996; Meyer et al., 1999). Sangster et al. (1978) speculated that isosporosis is more common in units with straw bedding due to a poor hygienic status. Meyer et al. (1999), however, frequently found the parasite also in large, well\u2010managed piglet production units, while above\u2010average hygiene measures in a nucleus herd were associated with low infection rates. Contaminated farrowing units are probably the most important source of infection of the piglets (Lindsay, 1989), and consequently hygiene is of utmost importance to lower the infection pressure; however, even after thorough cleaning and disinfection few oocysts can remain which are sufficient for the spread of infection (Christensen and Henriksen, 1994).",

As previously described (Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999) oocysts were found most frequently in faecal samples of pasty consistence and yellow\u2010grey colour.

Histological lesions were found mainly in the medial and caudal jejunum and in the ileum, and in these sections parasite stages in the epithelium were most common. We therefore recommend that several tissue samples be removed from these areas of the small intestines. The microscopic alterations of the intestinal mucosa were also described by other authors for piglets with natural (Eustis and Nelson, 1981; Vitovec and Koudela, 1987) or experimental (Matuschka and Heydorn, 1980) isosporosis. In cases of field infections more asexual than sexual stages were found in the epithelium (Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Chae et al., 1998), which is in agreement with our findings. Piglets infected primarily with asexual stages at necropsy displayed the most prominent pathohistological changes of the intestinal mucosa, as described by Stuart et al. (1980) and Robinson et al. (1983), and the stages can be considered to be the more pathogenic. The position of the endogenous stages in the epithelium was identical to previous observations (Lindsay et al., 1980; Matuschka and Heydorn, 1980; Harleman and Meyer, 1984); occasionally the large intestines are affected without significant histological alterations (Sangster et al., 1978; Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Harleman and Meyer, 1984). Several animals harboured only few parasites in the different intestinal sections despite distinct mucosal alterations, as previously described by Current (1987) and Lindsay et al. (1999). According to Stuart et al. (1982) the degree and distribution of the Isospora\u2010induced alterations depend on the age of the piglet and the infection dose. Since in cases of field infections time and dose of infection are unknown, we could not correlate the pathohistological changes to the infection rate of the epithelium. However, it could be demonstrated that infection of the intestinal epithelium with coccidia is unambiguously correlated with pathohistological changes of varying degrees. Isosporosis was diagnosed more often by histology than by coproscopy only, so that the histological examination of piglets sacrificed for diagnostic necropsy should be part of Isospora diagnosis.",

Faecal examination of the litters showed that S. ransomi and Eimeria spp. occured only rarely in suckling piglets and, as is the case for Cryptosporidium, were negligible as causative agents for diarrhoea. Similarly, viruses were found only rarely in our investigations. Coronaviruses, which cause TGE and EVD, could not be isolated. In general, these agents seem to have declined in importance since PRCV (porcine respiratory coronavirus) was found in Europe (Paul et al., 1994) and are more common in weaners (Heinritzi et al., 1990). Rotavirus was found in a 20\u2010day\u2010old piglet; however, this animal did not display more distinct lesions of the small intestine than those with pure Isospora infections as described by some authors (Eustis and Nelson, 1981; Vitovec and Koudela, 1987), which is probably due to the age of the animal. Pure rotavirus infections often do not cause any symptoms due to the ubiquity of the virus and the immune protection of the piglets (Waldmann and Plonait, 1997).",

Enterotoxic E. coli (ETEC) are amongst the most important causes for diarrhoea in suckling piglets and weaners; however, the cause for diarrhoea is hypersecretion with little or no mucosal lesions of the mucosa (Waldmann and Plonait, 1997). Only three of the 12 E. coli isolates were haemolytic and have to be considered as pathogenic for piglets. In previous works ETEC were also only rarely found in Isospora\u2010infected piglets (Ilieff, 1997; Chae et al., 1998).

We only found necrotic enteritis in one case of isosporosis with concurrent infection with C. perfringens type A. It can be assumed that secondary pathogens can exacerbate an Isospora infection, and that the infection rate of the epithelium with parasite stages causing primary damage plays a crucial role for the course of the disease. Competing infectious agents make diagnosis more difficult and may be misinterpreted as primary causes of diarrhoea (Greve, 1985; Lindsay et al., 1992), so that a complete diagnosis even after isolation of one enteropathogen is important (Chae et al., 1998).",

The results of coproscopy and necropsy make it clear that under managment practices common in Germany I. suis infections are correlated with diarrhoea. Higgins (1999) hypothesized that in the United Kingdom isosporosis is commonly overlooked, and in cases of diarrhoea and poor performance of suckling piglets Isospora\u2010directed diagnosis should be strongly considered. The increasing awareness of I. suis as an important enteropathogen in suckling piglets led to the recommendation of Martineau and Del Castillo (1999) to use toltrazuril (Baycox\u00ae., Bayer) for `diagnostic therapy' in cases where clinical and epidemiological findings are characteristic. The present investigation substantiates the impression that I. suis is also a primary cause of diarrhoea under the conditions of piglet production in Germany.",
