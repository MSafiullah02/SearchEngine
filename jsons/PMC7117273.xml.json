(2006) analyzed the spike gene sequences of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from the recent sporadic (December 2003\u2013January 2004) and 2002\u20132003 epidemic human cases and SARS-like-CoV from civet cats. The authors claimed that SARS-CoV strain GD03T0013 from the recent sporadic cases (WHO, 2004) was genetically closer to the human SARS-CoV from the early phase of the 2002\u20132003 epidemic than to the wild animal SARS-like-CoV from the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. Wang et al. (2006) therefore concluded that the recent sporadic human SARS-CoV was closer to an unknown SARS-CoV predecessor, which is remarkably different from the conclusions of previous studies (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005). A drawback of the study by Wang et al. (2006) is the exclusion of a number of civet cats SARS-like-CoV sequences, leading to the inability of their analyses to fully delineate the phylogenetic origin of strain GD03T0013.",

In particular, our dataset included the SARS-like-CoV isolated from civet cats in the 2003\u20132004 epidemic, which were not in the dataset of Wang et al. (2006). The sequences were aligned with ClustalX 1.83 (Thompson et al., 1994) and gap columns were removed, generating an alignment of 3672 bp. Phylogenies were reconstructed from the alignment using three methods, including neighbor-joining (NJ) implemented in PAUP* 4.0b (Swofford, 2002), maximum likelihood (ML) implemented in PhyML 2.4.4 (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) implemented in MrBayes (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003). The substitution model used was the best-fit model suggested by ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998). Five thousand bootstrap replications were performed in both the NJ and ML methods, whereas two sets of four tempered MCMC chains of 550,000 generations sampled every 100th generation with initial 10% burn-ins were used in the BMCMC method.",

Therefore, only the ML phylogeny is presented here and the confidences of its topology were summarized from ML and NJ bootstrapping, as well as the sampled trees in BMCMC chains. The summarized ML phylogeny (Fig. 1\n) shows that strain GD03T0013 shares a monophyletic relationship with the wild animal SARS-like-CoV cluster B (isolated in 2003\u20132004 epidemic) and this conclusion is supported by high confidence values. Table 1\nshows the comparison of the pairwise genetic distances (nucleotide p-distances) between the spike gene of strain GD03T0013 and other strains of our dataset. The genetic distance between civet cat SARS-like-CoV strain PC4-115 (and HC/SZ/266/03) from wild animal cluster B and strain GD03T0013 is smaller than that between any strains in the human epidemic cluster and the wild animal cluster A isolated during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. Remarkably, only one nucleotide difference was identified between the spike genes of strains GD03T0013 and PC4-115 (and HC/SZ/266/03). In the spike gene phylogeny (Fig. 1), PC4-115 (and HC/SZ/266/03) could be also interpreted as the direct phylogenetic predecessor of GD03T0013. Although the first patient (GD03T0013) reported no contact with civet cats and other animals in the 2 months preceding the disease onset (Wang et al., 2005), these phylogenetic and genetic evidences, as well as those presented by previous studies (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005) suggested that the recent human case was a sporadic infection originating from the SARS-like-CoV of a wild animal.",

They used fewer isolates and, more importantly, did not include the civet cat SARS-like-CoV sequences isolated in 2003\u20132004 epidemic (shown in Fig. 1 under the wild animal cluster B grouping) in their analysis. Consequently, they could not fully delineate the phylogenetic origin of the SARS-CoV in the recent sporadic human cases.
