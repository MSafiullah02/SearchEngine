WHO has declared the pandemic outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a global health emergency. Immunotherapy is an efficient therapeutic option intervention against viral infections. Most immunotherapy attempts have been successful to fight against similar COVID-19 viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The main methods in this regard include several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates. Furthermore, according to existing evidence in fighting against viral infections such as Ebola, influenza, SARS, and MERS plasma exchange can likely reduce the viral load and disease mortality [3], [4].",
