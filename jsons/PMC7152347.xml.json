Establishing microbial diagnosis of pneumonia has been problematic in infants and children due to difficulty in distinguishing infection from colonization of the upper airways and lack of availability of dependable diagnostic laboratory tests.7 In two studies of pneumonia in immunocompetent children, specific etiologic agents were confirmed in only 43% to 66%.8, 9 Identification of more than one pathogen makes it difficult to assign primary pathogenicity.2 While bloodstream infection (BSI) confirms etiology, BSI occurs in only 1% to 10% of hospitalized children with bacterial pneumonia.10, 11, 12 Pathogens vary according to age, underlying illnesses, and maturation and function of the immune system.13 Certain pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and Mycoplasma, are seasonal. In other instances, the pattern of family illness provides a clue to the causative agent. Extensive or invasive testing usually is not necessary.",

Human parechovirus 1 (HPeV-1) was identified in the early 2000s, to cause LRTI in young children.18 In 2003, coronavirus was recognized as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in adults; however, it caused milder disease with no documented deaths in children.19, 20, 21 RSV, HMPV, and influenza viruses cause infection during the winter season whereas PIV and rhinoviruses are more common in spring and autumn; adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year.

However, both staphylococcal and streptococcal pneumonia are rapidly progressive and severe, frequently leading to hypoxemia and pleural effusion within hours.

Culture of nasopharyngeal specimens does not confirm etiology because many bacterial pathogens also are common commensals. Further, noncommensal organisms residing in the upper airway may not be the cause of LRTI. Tracheal aspiration is useful for culture if performed with direct laryngoscopy. However, culture samples obtained via a catheter directly passed through a tracheostomy, endotracheal tube, or deep nasotracheal tube have limitations due to frequent contamination with upper respiratory tract organisms. (Specimen could be evaluated as for a sputum sample.) Quantitative culture performed on a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen is considered significant when the isolate colony count is >104/mL. Blood culture is specific but insensitive. A 2002 study demonstrated that transthoracic needle aspiration (lung tap) in hospitalized children with clinical pneumonia had a high microbiologic yield and was relatively safe; this procedure is not performed widely in the U.S.32\n",

Most healthy children with acute LRTIs recover without sequelae, but some patients, especially premature infants, immunocompromised hosts, or children with chronic lung, neuromuscular, or cardiovascular diseases can develop complications. Complications include necrotizing pneumonia, parapneumonic effusion, empyema, pneumatocele formation, and lung abscess. In the late 1990s, there was a significant increase in complications from bacterial pneumonia in infants and children in the U.S.91, 92 Since universal immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children <2 years of age, frequency of complicated pneumococcal pneumonia due to vaccine strains and complications due to presumed bacterial pneumonia have decreased.93, 94\n",

Various infectious agents induce pleural effusion by different mechanisms including a sympathetic response to a bacterial infection by elaboration of cytokines, extension of infection, an immune-complex phenomenon or as a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., rupture of tuberculous granuloma). Replication of microorganisms in the subpleural alveoli precipitates an inflammatory response resulting in endothelial injury, increased capillary permeability, and extravasation of pulmonary interstitial fluid into the pleural space. Pleural fluid is infected readily because it lacks opsonins and complement. Bacteria interfere with the host defense mechanism by production of endotoxins and other toxic substances. Anaerobic glycolysis results from further accumulation of neutrophils and bacterial debris. This in turn causes pleural fluid to become purulent and acidic (i.e., empyema). The acidic environment of the pleural fluid suppresses bacterial growth and interferes with antibiotic activity. With disease progression, inflammatory cytokines activate coagulation pathways, leading to deposition of fibrin.",
