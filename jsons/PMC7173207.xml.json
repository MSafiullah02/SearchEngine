            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious viral disease that affects domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007). The etiological agent is the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a Gammacoronavirus from the family Coronaviridae (ICTV, 2016). IBV genome is a single positive sense RNA strand with approximately 27.6 Kb in length that encodes four structural proteins - nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) - in addition to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and numerous accessory proteins (Jackwood, 2012). Among all the structural proteins, S is the most important for antigenic and immunogenic reasons. It is cleaved into the subunits S1 and S2 with approximately 535 and 625 amino acids, respectively. S1 glycoprotein is important in adsorption to the cellular receptor and virus entry into the host cell, besides inducing neutralizing antibodies. S1 gene is highly variable among the different viral strains and is directly related to the diversity of IBV antigenic and genetic groups (Cavanagh, 2007; Toro et al., 2012).",

            "text": "IBV genetic diversity, mainly in the S1 gene, was demonstrated in different poultry-producing regions of the world. Historically, Massachusetts (Mass) and Connecticut (Conn) serotypes were the first isolates in the 1940s and 1950s, respectively (Schalk and Hawn, 1931; Jungherr et al., 1956). Since then, several new IBV sero/genotypes have been identified and associated with the disease around the world (Cook et al., 2012; De Wit et al., 2011). However, for decades, the identification and classification of IBV genetic types were mostly performed without clear criteria regarding the nomenclature, methods to compare viral molecular data and exact genetic region to be analyzed. Consequently, subclades of the closely related virus, sometimes circulating in small geographical regions, have been assigned as new genotypes and more than 50 genetic groups were already reported (De Wit et al., 2011). Recently, a more definitive phylogeny-based classification system was proposed for the assignment of IBV strains. This study classified IBV in six genotypes, which are further divided into 32 genetic lineages, and provides reliable reference sequences (lineage prototypes) to guide the viral classification (Valastro et al., 2016).",

Similar strains were also observed to circulate in Argentina and Uruguay and the whole genetic cluster was also identified as South America I (SA-I) (Marandino et al., 2015) and recently renamed as GI-11 (Valastro et al., 2016). Moreover, subclades of GI-11 were reported by distinct studies (Fraga et al., 2013; Villarreal et al., 2010) but the origin of these lineages and the role of recombination are still to be investigated.",

BEAST software allows for the combination of different clock, substitution, and demographic models, demanding an appropriate model test approach. In the current study, marginal likelihood estimation (MLE) (Baele et al., 2012, Baele et al., 2013) was applied to compare alternative models in a Bayesian framework. Trees were reconstructed using SRD06 substitution model (Shapiro et al., 2005) and the uncorrelated gamma distributed (ucgd) relaxed molecular clock (Drummond et al., 2006), which outperformed alternative models. IBV demographic history in Brazil was investigated by applying the non-parametric Bayesian Skygrid coalescent model, which estimates the product of viral effective population size (Ne) and generation time throughout evolutionary history (Gill et al., 2013). To avoid making assumptions regarding IBV generation time, here we refer to estimates of effective population size as relative genetic diversity. In addition, we tested with MLE the best demographic parameter that described the IBV population history.",

Our analyses showed that these sequences are mostly GI-11 but have a fragment of around 250 bp that does not match with any other described lineage. Aiming to identify the origin of this fragment, a BLAST search was performed using the unassigned portion of S1 gene as a query. This procedure gave rise to two sequences that were not present in our compiled dataset and although these sequences were isolated in a distinct state, they also clustered with the group isolated in MT state and showed the same recombination pattern (Fig. 2). The second group with high divergence within GI-11 lineage is composed only of sequences from Argentina and Uruguay. Bootscanning revealed that the analyzed S1 region was mostly related to GI-11 cluster, with a small region with very low similarity to any of the described lineages. Analysis performed with bigger window sizes (Supplementary Fig. 1), however, shows small support for recombination in this region.

Phylodynamic analysis of the \u201cpure\u201d GI-11 lineage sequences estimated the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of this group to 1951 (1917 to 1975, 95% highest posterior density [HPD]) (Fig. 3\n).

Skygrid plot reconstructed a relative genetic diversity trajectory with a small variation since the introduction of IBV GI-11 lineage in Brazil in the beginning of the 1950s (Fig. 3). Among the parametric demographic models, the constant population was estimated as the best-fitted parameter.

Our analyses showed that 46 sequences (24%) isolated in Brazil were classified as GI-1 lineage, which corresponds to the Mass serotype. Since the end of the 1970s, a vaccine derived from this serotype has been extensively used in the field in Brazil. The Mass vaccine is available as inactivated or attenuated-live, but the second one is commonly used in the field poultry flocks. Previous studies reported that this vaccine strain could spread in the flock for few weeks, due to the intermittent shedding of virions from trachea and cloaca (Matthijs et al., 2008; Naqi et al., 2003). This ability of the vaccine strain to disseminate could be thought as risk to turn it into a new field strain. However, different studies demonstrated a very high identity among all GI-1 lineage sequences obtained from field flocks and Mass commercial vaccines distributed in Brazil suggesting they are the vaccine strains (Balestrin et al., 2014; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011; Fraga et al., 2013; Villarreal et al., 2010). Therefore, the high frequency of Mass serotype observed might be due to a local viral spread after the intensive vaccination practices.",

In Brazil, the lineages Ark and 4/91 were isolated from vaccinated flocks (Mass serotype vaccine) in 1999 and 2007, 2008, respectively (Montassier et al., 2008; Villarreal et al., 2010). The Mass serotype was the only licensed attenuated strain to be used in field vaccination programs in Brazil until 2016 when the Brazilian GI-11 strain started to be used as an attenuated-live vaccine. However, both lineages Ark and 4/91 are used in vaccination protocols in other countries and the frequencies observed in our study could be related to the use of imported vaccines or for the importation of birds from places where those strains are present (Felippe et al., 2010; Villarreal et al., 2010). On the other hand, the fact that these strains were not found in samples isolated recently suggests that these are self-limiting cases of less epidemiological importance.",

These findings are similar to the previous studies performed in order to classify the field isolates (Carranza et al., 2017; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011; Fraga et al., 2013). Our study also observed that a subclade in the GI-11 lineage presented possible recombination breakpoints in the bootscanning plots. This subclade is composed only of sequences from Brazil and was first named as BR-II (Fraga et al., 2013). The current study suggests it also belongs to GI-11 lineage. The bootscanning procedure also revealed that a subclade of sequences from Argentina and Uruguay might present recombinant fragments, however, in this case, the support of 160 and 200 bp window sizes were weak and new analyses with longer sequences should be performed to confirm our findings. A third potential recombinant group of sequences grouped basally to the GI-11 lineage and our results show that these sequences have indeed a fragment or two of GI-11 lineage in their genome. The backbone genome of these sequences was mostly unclassified, or at least not represented among the list of reference sequences used in this study.",

These events could be responsible for the emergence of this diverse number of variant strains in the field (Jackwood, 2012). Due to the advance of the bioinformatics programs for recombination screening, several studies have been performed in order to evaluate if the recombinant events could be the source of these variant isolates described worldwide (Kiss et al., 2016; Naguib et al., 2016; Quinteros et al., 2016). Moreover, the high prevalence of avian coronaviruses circulating in birds other than chicken suggests that wild and synanthropic birds are potential disseminators and could play a role in the emergence of recombinant strains and the dissemination of IBV among distant regions (Dur\u00e3es-Carvalho et al., 2015). Therefore, it might be possible that wild birds are the source of the unclassified sequence fragments observed in the recombinant strains identified in the current study. Notwithstanding, our BLAST search approach would be able to identify the recombinant parental strains if their sequences were present in the public databases. Lastly, is important to note that regions in the bootscanning plots that do not resemble any of the reference IBV lineages might be simply originated by single nucleotide mutations and are not necessarily resulted from events of recombination.",

The first reported case of IB in poultry flocks in the country was performed by Hip\u00f3lito in 1956 (Hip\u00f3lito, 1957). According to this author, the introduction of the IBV in Brazil, and probably into South America, could be explained by the importation of chickens from North American and European countries, where the disease was endemic in that time. The poultry production underwent major changes during the 1950s in Brazil, with the beginning of the industrial and intensive broiler rearing systems, which allowed an important expansion of the poultry production (Belusso and Hespanhol, 2010; Sorj et al., 2008). On the other hand, the intensive rearing systems and the high population of the flocks may allow the quick dissemination of respiratory diseases, which was common at the time (Hip\u00f3lito, 1957).",

However, BF support was only moderate (BF = 3.7) over the exponential model and weak (BF = 2.4) over the expansion model, that might suggest a more complex scenario where fluctuations in the population size do not follow any of the tested parameters. By using the non-parametric coalescent Skygrid model, a smooth increase in relative genetic diversity can be observed since its introduction in Brazil until the late 1970s, when the vaccination based on the Mass serotype started. From this point onward, the Skygrid plot fluctuates around the same value, but we cannot observe a trend of fall in relative genetic diversity, suggesting a partially effective vaccination program. It is not uncommon for some IBV vaccines to induce poor protection against different serotypes of the virus (Ladman et al., 2006), which allows some viruses to scape of the immune system response provided by vaccination protocols. Most of the sequences analyzed here were originated from samples collected from vaccinated birds, that might support the idea that the Mass serotype has none or poor efficiency to control the GI-11 replication in the field, as indicated by studies of IBV experimental infection (Fernando et al., 2013, Fernando et al., 2017). Moreover, the oldest available Brazilian GI-11 sequence was originated from a sample collected in 1975. This, together with the GI-11 lineage estimated tMRCA (1951 [1917 to 1975, 95% HPD]), indicates that this lineage was already circulating in the country by the time when vaccination started. A very limited or no protection of Mass vaccine against these field variants may have allowed the spread and maintained of GI-11 lineage in Brazilian flocks, reflecting in an approximately constant viral population from 1980 to 2014. The constant viral population scenario revealed by our analyses, however with not strong BF support, also provide evidence that the vaccination based on the Mass serotype did not impact the GI-11 clade demographic history in Brazil. Franzo et al. (2016) have reported that a vaccination program based in a combination of Mass and 4/91 strains was more effective in controlling the spread of the GI-19 lineage when compared to protocols using only Mass vaccines. In this sense, since 2016, a new attenuated vaccine based on GI-11 (BR-I) lineage is available to be used in Brazilian commercial flocks and future studies are needed to evaluate changes in the viral molecular diversity and demographic dynamics of IBV in Brazil. It is important to highlight that the changes in viral relative genetic diversity estimated by the Skygrid model are subtle and the confidence interval of the analysis is wide, so only studies with more sequences could precisely describe the Brazilian IBV demographics' history and whether it is in expansion or controlled.",
