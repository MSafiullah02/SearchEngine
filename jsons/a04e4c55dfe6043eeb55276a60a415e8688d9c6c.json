He mentioned having had contact with two COVID-19 cases [infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] within the past 5 days. His temperature was 38.7\u00b0 C, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, heart rate of 132 bpm and oxygen saturation of 93% with an ambient air breathing apparatus. Pulmonary auscultation found bibasilar crackles. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed basal bilateral groundglass opacities and air-space consolidation that was highly suggestive of COVID-19 injury (graded as minor, affecting < 10% of lung volume). An oropharyngeal swab for COVID-19 was positive. Blood gas testing found a low pH (7.25) with bicarbonate (8 mmol/L) suggestive of metabolic acidosis. Besides these findings, the patient's capillary blood glucose was 23.7 mmol/L with elevated ketonaemia (5.2 mmol/L), which confirmed the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Results of his laboratory findings are detailed in Table I. The treatment administered for DKA included intravenous (IV) insulin infusions, and correction of fluid loss and electrolyte disturbances. DKA remission was rapidly obtained and subcutaneous (sc) insulin therapy was started 24 h after admission.",

Indeed, in the course of T1D, the cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of \u03b2 cells in the pancreas leading to hyperglycaemia begins some time (0.5-1.5 years) before the onset of its symptomatic manifestations [2] . However, that COVID-19 could exacerbate DKA as a precipitating factor cannot be excluded, as it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, through binding to its ACE-2 receptor expressed in \u03b2 cells, can damage islets and, thus, reduce insulin release [3] .",
