Mostly a short dsRNA fragment known as siRNA mediates homology-based regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 1) (Almeida and Allshire 2005). This process can be compared to another approach based on miRNA knockdown and replacement. For inhibition, a synthetic ssRNA known as antagomirs/anti-miRs employed as the antagonist of intrinsic miRNA through an antisense mechanism. The replacement process involves synthetic miRNAs which are introduced in-vivo to mimic the function of the endogenous miRNAs. This RNA mimicking leads to gene silencing and degradation/inhibition of mRNA consequently. This chapter elaborates the clinical application of RNA interference in medical treatment and exclusively focuses on the siRNA therapy (Aagaard and Rossi 2007).\n",

            "text": "The Argonaute (Ago) proteins are the sole member of RISC and the catalytic domain of Ago-2 enables the cleavage of targeted mRNA region (Meister et al. 2004). The siRNAs embedded within RISC are duplex, Ago-2 proteins detach and remove one of the strands from RISC bounded double-stranded siRNA referred to as the passenger strand. The other single strand, known as guide RNA, remains embedded in the RISC complex (Fig. 2). The functionally active complex with guide RNA recognizes the target due to specific intermolecular base pair interaction (Tang 2005). Ago-2 protein is composed of three functional subunits; namely PIWI, PAZ, and MID. Among these, the PIWI domain possesses the structural folding similar to RNase H and provides thermodynamic enthalpy to the RISC complex for cleavage (Song et al. 2004). The PAZ subunit of the Ago-2 protein binds two terminal 3\u2032-nucleotide specifically for connecting it to the RISC complex. The staggered ends of the siRNA consisting of the specific nucleotide lie in the core domain in a hydrophobic cavity composed of various aromatic residues where the base of the terminal nucleotide is stacked (Song et al. 2003). The 5\u2032-phosphate group of siRNA is bounded to the carboxyl-end of the protein in the middle of the MID and PIWI domains through a magnesium ion (Ma et al. 2005). It is observed that the Argonaute family also contributes while guide-strand selection. Argonaute conserves the strand which has less thermodynamically stable 5\u2032-terminal as the guide strand and cleaves another one to release the passenger strand (Schwarz et al. 2003).Certain basic principles such as thermodynamic stability of the siRNA end regulate the selection of the strand which remains anchored to the RISC complex (Schwarz et al. 2003). The strand with less stability at the terminals usually converts to form mRNA molecules which can be recognized and later on degraded by Ago-2. The strand complementary to the targeted mRNA act as guide RNA.\n",

The high potential of RNAi approach observed because of the fact that effector molecules may function at a lower concentration than in the case of ribozymes or antisense oligos. This is a major advantage in a clinical scenario. The underlying factor for the above success of RNAi over other antisense-based practices for treatment purpose is that it autonomously target the complementary transcripts by using the host cellular machinery, often leading to suppression of gene expression up to much extend. Of note, small antisense ssRNAs may also bind complementarily into RISC and conduct target mRNA (Martinez et al. 2002).",

Conventional treatment of psoriasis topically applies corticosteroids, which leads to weight gain, itching dryness, stinging, fluid retention, irritation, hypopigmentation, atrophy, hypertension, and other side effects. It is highly desirable to find drug molecules with fewer side effects. Therefore, targeting the genetic cause i.e. upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines is a more suitable way to treat psoriasis. The overproduction of cytokine can be regulated by suppressing tumor necrosis factor alpha protein. Animal studies show that silencing of gene encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha resulted in the improvement in the psoriatic lesion.",

Similarly, a targeted decrease in APP expression through the same mechanism also serves the purpose.",

The evidence from these studies shows that most siRNA molecules are probably not as specific as it was presumed and that siRNA treatment can bring about off-target gene silencing. The off-target effect refers to the suppression of genetic region other than the causative gene target. Such a phenomenon may produce undesirable genetic alteration and cellular dysfunction. The most common reason of \u201coff-target\u201d silencing is the seed region of the siRNA sequence. This region is characterized by partial homology of 6\u20137 nucleotide long sequence particularly inside the 3\u2032 untranslated sequence (3\u2032UTR) which bound with a different mRNAs rather than the desired target mRNA (Birmingham et al. 2006). In the condition, a seed region siRNA acquiring complementarity with certain regulatory miRNAs may distort the gene expression (Mouldy 2006). Moreover, failure of discrimination between the guide strand and the passenger strand by RISC may prompt the chances of complementary interaction between siRNA and non-targeted mRNA. The off-target effect can also arise as an after effect of the immune activation.

On contrary, longer RNA strands elicit an immune response as it bounds to either TLRs or to certain enzymes such as 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L or protein kinase to trigger interferon. There are specific GU-rich motifs which are actually determined by TLR7, refer as \u201cdanger motif\u201d. For example, in the endosome vesicle of plasmacytoid dendritic cells 5\u2032-GUCCUUCAA-3\u2032 sequence is recognized by the TLR7 and stimulates innate mechanisms to release inflammatory cytokines further. Another example is of TLR9 activity is countering CpG motifs in antisense oligonucleotides. Thus the immune actions can be controlled by mode of delivery and passage across various intracellular compartments of the siRNA. RNA oligonucleotides larger than 27\u201329 base pairs and highly potent Dicer substrates siRNAs need to be safely administered and monitored for immunogenic side-effects (Rose et al. 2005).",

Some of them are-(i)Designing artificially chemically modified siRNA structures which are prepared by substituting various molecules or atoms at different positions for examples-substituting phosphodiester (PO4) linkages with phosphorothioate (PS) at the 3\u2032-end, or introducing the new molecules that resist the enzymatic degradation like adding O-methyl (2\u2032-O-Me), fluoro (2\u2032-F) groups or methoxyethyl (2\u2032-O-MOE) group significantly prolonged circulation half-life in systemic route and improved RNAi efficiency (Czauderna 2003; Chiu and Rana 2003).(ii)By complexation with a molecule or carrier, for example, the cholesterol-siRNA complex. The cholesterol-siRNA complexes improve pharmacokinetics (increases half-life of siRNA) (Wolfrum et al. 2007).(iii)By encapsulating siRNA in a carrier such as viral vectors. Various natural viral vectors have already in use for systemic transport of siRNA to treat various carcinomas. Jung et al. used an adenoviral vector encoding siRNA significantly suppressed the outgrowth of the pituitary tumor by transforming gene overexpressed in both in-vivo and in-vitro hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Jung et al. 2006). Sabbioni et al. (2006) showed type 1-based amplicon vectors that based on herpes simplex virus, inhibited in-vivo tumor formation of human polyomavirus BK-transformed cells (pRPc cells) (Sabbioni et al. 2006).Even though the above-mentioned methods have several advantages and provide a good platform to improve delivery of naked siRNA. However, the frequent application of these methods is limited because they are also having numerous drawbacks such as safety issues (insertion mutagenesis and immunogenicity) low loading efficiency and only laboratory/small-scale production. Furthermore, siRNA is more liable to nuclease degradation than circular plasmids. Therefore, we need a stable delivery system to improve the systemic delivery of siRNA.",

The kidney is made up of numerous glomeruli, and the main function of glomeruli is the natural filtration barrier of undesired by-products in the blood. The size of pore the glomeruli membrane is approximately 8 nm (Wartiovaara et al. 2004). Any molecules that have a molecular weight and a size below 50 kDa and 8 nm, respectively are typically rapidly expelled from the kidney (Rappaport et al. 1995). After systemic delivery, siRNA is rapidly expelled out from the body system through either renal clearance and filtration through the renal system or the entrapment in the RES in the liver, spleen, lungs and bone marrow. For increasing the retention time of siRNA in the body, siRNA is entrapped indifferent NCs that have the size range between 20 and 100 nm in diameter. This optimal size range helps to avoid potency for avoiding both renal clearance and RES entrapment and allows NCs to remain in the circulation for a longer period and to increase the rate of intracellular penetration in tumor cells and tissues via passive targeting (Jang et al. 2003; Pecot et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The specific physiochemical properties of naked siRNA are their anionic charge due to the presence of phosphate groups in the structure and hydrophilicity. As the plasma membrane is made up of lipid bilayers, it is lipophilic in nature and having anionic charge. Therefore, the intracellular penetration of siRNA across the plasma membrane is quite limited by passive transportation due to the electrostatic repulsion. When the siRNA is administrated in the bloodstream, it is immediately covered by a major component of blood plasma protein i.e. serum albumin and initiates our immune system to engulf albumin coated siRNA by phagocytes NCs entraps or covered the siRNA, avoid the engulfment by the phagocytes cells and increase the cell penetration of siRNA. Polycationic (positively charged) NCs are the best suited for high siRNA loading, shielding from degradation during bloodstream circulation, and systemic delivery of siRNA, especially to metastatic tumors. The most commonly used polymers are polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Illum and Davis 1984; Norman et al. 1993). According to Bonnet et al. (2008) linear PEI-siRNA (lPEI/siRNA) conjugate showed better cytocompatibility and non-immunogenic than branched PEI-siRNA (bPEI/siRNA) conjugate (Bonnet et al. 2008). However, the NCs that are prepared from a single PEI polymer is not stable during systemic delivery of siRNA and agglomerate in the bloodstream due to slat medium and serum protein. The prominent solution to overcome the problem is to use a copolymer/mixed polymer (di or triblock copolymers) which are more stable, for example, PEI can be mixed with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) to prepare a PEGylated PEI/siRNA. PEG polymer covers at the outside of the PEI/siRNA conjugate by forming a hydrophilic layer that sufficiently reduces the agglomeration tendency of NCs with increased EPR effect (Malek et al. 2008; Merkel et al. 2009). Kim et al. (2012) prepared mannosylated and pegylated polyethyleneimine/siRNA (PEI-PEG-MAN/siRNA) polyplex NCs with an approximate size of 357.33 nm for increased cellular uptake of siRNA. In this conjugate, PEI entrapped a high amount of negatively charged siRNA, PEG provided outer stable hydrophilic membrane, and mannose was used as a cell binding ligand for macrophages (Kim et al. 2012).",

To increase the concentration of siRNA on the targeted site, the nanocarriers-mediated targeted delivery system is a new and novel approach to increase the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an active transport system that improves the rate of cellular uptake of siRNA loaded NCs.

These NCs bypass the endosomal compartment and improve the efficacy of siRNA delivery (Qian and Berkland 2015). It is a pH-sensitive polymer that is hydrophobic in nature at neutral and physiological pH medium. However, in mild acidic medium (pH <6.2) it changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in nature (Licciardi et al. 2005). This polymer can easily encapsulate the desired amount of siRNA and shield the siRNA from enzymatic degradation at physiological pH. The encapsulated siRNA is released in the cytoplasm after dissociation of NCs in early endosomes or lysosomes (pH <6) via protonation of the PDPA and display an outstanding \u2018proton sponge\u2019 effect (PSE) due to tertiary amines at the terminal surface (Yu et al. 2011).",

The PSE produces from numerous slightly basic cojugates (between pH 5 and 6), promoting proton (H+) absorption in cellular organelles with lower pH and an osmotic pressure generated around the organelle membrane. Due to the generation of osmotic pressure, acidic endosome burst and release the materials into the cytoplasm. The advantage of the PSE is that we could easily control this effect by partially altering the groups from carboxylic acid (-COOH) to tertiary (3\u00b0) amines. Whenever both the functional groups are attached on the surface of NCs, form electrostatic and steric interactions that are extremely reactive to the acidic organelles and siRNA is appropriately attached and cellular entry (Yezhelyev et al. 2008).",

A very less amount of siRNA is passed through from the semi-permeable plasma membrane. After the intracellular delivery, siRNA is less stable in the bloodstream and has a very less half-life (<5 min) due to rapid enzymatic degradation by endogenous serum nucleases (Tseng et al. 2009). The intracellular trafficking of siRNAs starts in early endosomal vesicles where siRNA fuse with sorting endosomes and finally transfer their contents to the late endosomes. A high amount of siRNA is entrapped by the late endosomes and lysosomes and very less amount of siRNA is reached into the cytoplasm to come into play regardless of the release mechanism. To avoid the rapid degradation and shielding from engulfing by the late endosomes and lysosomes, various NCs have been developed to shield the naked siRNA such as cationic lipid, (Lu et al. 2009) polymers and di or triblock copolymers NCs, (Qian and Berkland 2015) nanomicelles (Zhou et al. 2016) etc.",

The most commonly used natural polymer is chitosan (CS), poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), (Zhou et al. 2012) atelocollagen, (Minakuchi et al. 2004) inulin (Cavallaro et al. 2017). CS is a linear, natural, cationic, FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved polysaccharide (a long chain of monosaccharide carbohydrate) co-block polymer of glucosamine and N-acetylated glucosamine. Polymer and has been used for both in-vitro and in-vivo systemic delivery of siRNA because it has nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability properties (Malhotra et al. 2013; Vauthier et al. 2013). Currently, CS is the highly used polysaccharide polymer for delivering of therapeutic agents (drugs and genetic agents) due to its high permeability capability across the semipermeable cell membrane (des Rieux et al. 2006). In one of the study, prepared an novel amino acid-functionalized Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-chitosan nanoparticle (RGD-CHNP) that significantly increased selective intratumoral delivery of siRNA for regulation of many growth-promoting genes (PLXDC1, FAK, and POSTN) accompanied by therapeutic efficacy in the A2780, HeyA8, and SKOV3ip1 orthotopic animal studies of ovarian cancer models (Han et al. 2010). Besides natural polymers, several biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic synthetic PNCs have also been used for systemic delivery of siRNA such as PLL (Cun et al. 2011), PEI (Nimesh and Chandra 2009), PEG, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, polyfluorene, and cyclodextrin-based polycations. These polymers are linear and branched and similarly the efficient way to shield and efficient delivery of siRNA. Both types of PNCs can encapsulate a high amount of siRNA and deliver it via the passive route. For increasing the delivery concentration of siRNA on specific infected cells/tissues by escaping the normal cells and tissues, different actively targeted molecules are attached to the surfaces of PNCs (Table 1).\n",

Amphiphilic molecules are the molecules that have hydrophobic nonpolar \u201ctail\u201d at one end and hydrophilic polar \u201chead\u201d to the other end (Fig. 4b). Micelles are the colloidal suspension of the amphiphilic molecules. When amphiphilic molecules are mixed in the aqueous medium, the nonpolar hydrophobic tail is arranged inside the molecules and letting the polar side i.e. \u201chead\u201d to remain an outer side in direct contact with the aqueous medium and a hollow spherical or cylindrical structure is formed by the process of self -assembly. For example, Cao et al. (2011) mixed cationic PCL and PEI which self-assembled, forming biodegradable micelles. These micelles were utilized to carry anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 specific siRNA and along with an anti-cancer drug, docetaxel (DOX). Further, folic acid was surface-conjugated as a targeting ligand for hepatic cancer cells. This nano-assembly simultaneous delivered drug and siRNA to yield a combined RNAi-chemotherapeutic benefit against hepatic cancer (Cao et al. 2011). Similarly, Zhu et al. (2014) synthesized PEG-pp-PEI-PE nanomicelles for the delivery of siRNA against survivin or GFP along with paclitaxel (PTX). Efficient down-regulation of GFP gene and survivin were observed in PTX-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells after the micelles-mediated siRNA delivery compared to free drug (Zhu et al. 2014). In another study, prepared a PEGylated PEI-siRNA micellar nanoparticles that shown high entrapment efficiency and long-term blood circulation of siRNA loaded nanoparticles with reduced aggregation, opsonization, and inflammation response. In this study, polycationic PEI was used for high loading capacity of negatively charged siRNA and PEG was used for others advantages (Wu et al. 2017) (Table 2).\n",

Numerous functional groups (-COOH or -OH) are suitable for the attachment of various ligands that makes it more suitable for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Dendrimers are made up of repeated branching unit and form a shell of either same groups and different groups, this shell is known as generation \u201cG\u201d (Kulhari et al. 2015). When are mixed with dendrimers known as dendriplexes. Presently, dendrimers are used for the delivery of several hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, genes, bioimaging agents (Table 4). Depending on the type of central atom, different classes of dendrimers are available such as PAMAM (Polyamidoamine), PPI (Poly (propylene imine), PLL, and poly(2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, etc. (Svenson and Tomalia 2012).

There are several ways to load a sufficient amount of siRNA on Au NPs:(i)Thiol bond- siRNA is directly attached on AuNPs surface via a gold-thiol (R-S-H) bond.(ii)Ionic bond- Anionic siRNA can be attached on the surfaces of the cationic AuNPs due to the electrostatic interaction.(iii)Polymer coated surface- siRNA adhered to the AuNPs surface coated with biocompatible and biodegradable with polymers (Lee et al. 2008).\n",

MNPs have a diameter between 10 and 100 nm range and are obtained in two different oxidation states- Fe2O3 (ferric oxide/hematite) and Fe3O4 (magnetite/lodestone) NPs. When the diameter of NPs are <30 nm, they show the property of paramagnetism in the hysteresis of the magnetization loop of the particles because of the negligible coercivity arising from the infinitely small energy barrier (Lian et al. 2003).",

However, both classes of NPs has some limitations. Inorganic NPs such as MSNs may have more stability, mechanical, chemical and imaging properties but accumulates as non-degradable substances and confers toxicity. On the other side, organic NCs such as polymers, liposomes, and micelles are biocompatible as well as biodegradable with high encapsulation efficiency both on the surface and within the core, but less stable in-vivo. For removing the drawbacks of both type of NPs, the hybrid NCs are the best solution. These hybrid NCs are prepared with the fusion of both organic and inorganic NCs. Numerous biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are coated or grafted on the surfaces of both NCs. These polymers increase biocompatibility, loading tendency of genes with reduced toxicity (Tatiparti et al. 2017). Meanwhile the inorganic constituents provide diagnostic or therapeutic properties. Therefore, the hybrid NCs have benefit to offers the theranostics application with high delivery efficiency (Sailor and Ji-Ho 2012; Young et al. 2016) (Table 6).\n",

Currently, gene therapy acclaimed as a revolutionary option of new therapy. siRNA delivery is an alternative approach, that has been pursued actively because of their excellent safety, high efficacy and specificity, easy modification, and unlimited therapeutic targets. But the therapeutic efficacy of naked siRNA is reduced due to systemic instability, before reaching to the target site. To get rid of these hurdles, the most vital solution is to develop biocompatible, biodegradable, and site-specific nano-sized carriers. Every NC has its own benefits and limitations depending on its physicochemical composition, offering a flexible and wide variety of effective agents based on siRNA. Organic NCs such as polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles and micelles have excellent tendency to encapsulate the therapeutic molecules nevertheless they are unstable and easily degrade within the systemic circulation causing the premature release of therapeutic molecules before reaching the specific site. Mixed polymer micelles are quite stable compared to single polymer micelles. Inorganic naked metal and metal oxide NCs like Au NPs and MNPs are stable and can be easily functionalized. In spite of these advantages, several studies have proved that larger size and a higher concentration of these NCs are toxic. Moreover, naked NCs are also unstable in systemic delivery and rapidly agglomerated by blood plasma protein. Hence, these NCs require stabilizing materials. At last, the nanocarrier mediated delivery systems better solution to resolve issues related to the potent systemic delivery of siRNA. Some of the delivery systems also have proven their values and passed the initial clinical phases.",
