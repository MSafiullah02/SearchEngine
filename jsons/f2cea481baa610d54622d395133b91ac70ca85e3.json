The worldwide 258 distribution of CPPV-1 has resulted in the infection of various wild carnivorous 259 species (22, 35-38). Mech et al. (38) determined that CPPV-1 contributed to a 40% 260 to 60% reduction in wolf pup survival and impeded the population growth rate. 261 Disease induced by CPPV-1 infection was commonly found in the juvenile or 262 subadult individuals of domestic carnivores. However, adult individuals with severe 263 clinical signs of CPPV-1 infection were recorded (39-41). Studies are increasingly 264 reporting severe CPPV-1 enteritis in adult dogs (40, 42). Furthermore, a higher risk 265 of developing chronic gastrointestinal disease had been determined in dogs after 266 CPPV-1 infection (43). However, we observed a higher prevalence of CPPV-1 in FD 267 and adults. A higher prevalence may represent a higher risk of infection or lower 268 mortality. Prevalence data alone are not sufficient to evaluate the effect of CPPV-1 269 on different sample types or age categories. Therefore information regarding the 270 physical effects, pathological changes, and mortality caused by CPPV-1 is required. 271 FCoV infection has been documented in various domestic and wild felids (44-272 47). The infection can be asymptomatic or associated with a fatal systematic disease, 273 feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and enteric disease (48, 49). Mochizuki et al.

CPPV-1 is stable in the environment and infectiousness 291 can be maintained for several months (35). Free-roaming domestic carnivores are 292 commonly observed in the sampling area, which is an active area with 293 well-developed road systems (51, 52). Although the sample size was small, we 294 found a very high prevalence of CPPV-1 (90%; n = 10; data not shown) in 295 free-roaming dogs and cats in our sampling area. These conditions aggravate the296 transmission and distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. Future studies 297 should evaluate the influence of domestic carnivores on the transmission of CPPV-1 298 in the habitat. 299 In addition to pathogen surveillance, application of molecular analysis 300 techniques for pathogens has been suggested for investigating several aspects of 301 pathogenesis (53), including pathogen characterization and pathogen transmission 302 (53). We identified the infection of 4 strains of CPPV-1 and FCoV in leopard cats 303 based on the sequences of each positive amplification for selected pathogens. 304 Temporal dynamics revealed that the infection of CPV-2c and FPV was increased, 305 whereas CPV-2b infection was decreased. The distribution of CPV-2c in Taiwan was 306 first detected in dogs in 2015 (54). Since then, CPV-2c has gradually become the 307 predominant variant of CPPV-1 in dogs (54). We first detected CPV-2c in leopard 308 cats in 2017, which indicates an original transmission direction of CPPV-1 from 309 domestic carnivores to leopard cats. Background information and surveillance data 310for FPV are scarce. Therefore, factors that increase FPV infection rates still need to 311 be assessed. 312",

Studies have been 342 conducted involving serological surveys of FIV and FeLV in leopard cats inTaiwan 343and Vietnam and did not detect any positive cases (12, 57). However,Hayama et al.  344    (10) determined a prevalence of 3% (n = 86) and 13.6% (n = 280) of FIV infection 345 in Tsushima leopard cats and domestic cats, respectively, in Kami-Shima, Tsushima 346Island, Japan. The domestic cat was considered as the reservoir of FIV in the 347 Tsushima case (10, 58). The prevalence of FIV and FeLV varies between different 348 felids and geographic regions (59). 349The infection of CDV has been reported in both wild and domestic felids (59, 350 against CDV. Furthermore, a serological survey for CDV found a prevalence of 352 77.8% in wild Taiwanese leopard cats (62). Exposure to CDV in Taiwanese leopard 353 cats is considered to be high. However, none of the leopard cats manifested clinical 354 signs of CDV. Although we targeted amplifying the nucleotide sequence of CDV 355 and identifying the strain from leopard cats, the low detection probability was 356 expected because of a short virus shedding period. Furthermore, a diseased 357 individual may reduce their activity and thus the probability that they would be 358sampled. 359Our study revealed CPPV-1 and FCoV infection in free-living leopard cats. The360 sympatric domestic carnivores are considered the primary reservoir for the 361 pathogens identified in our study. Although the effects of CPPV-1 and FCoV on 362 individual leopard cats and populations of leopard cats were not evaluated in this 363 study, we strongly recommend the establishment of programs to manage CPPV-1 364 and FCoV in the leopard cat habitat with an emphasis on vaccination programs and 365 population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats. Previous studies have 366 indicated that because of antigenic differences among CPPV-1 variants, new 367 vaccines that also provide protection against the CPV-2c variant may need to be 368 developed (40, 63).
