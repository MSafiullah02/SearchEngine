            "text": "Respiratory infections caused by the atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. collectively account for approximately 15% of all community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases (Bartlett and Mundy, 1995, Gupta and Sarosi, 2001). Because these infections are difficult to discern from other causes of pneumonia based on examination, symptoms, or chest X-ray findings, laboratory identification of the etiology is critical to establish the correct course of treatment (Cunha, 2006). M. pneumoniae accounts for 15\u201320% of atypical CAPs, and outbreaks have been reported to occur in 3- to 7-year intervals with varying incidence rates (Foy, 1993, Klement et al., 2006, Waites and Talkington, 2004). Although symptoms are usually mild and individuals often do not seek medical treatment, some patients require hospitalization and severe extrapulmonary disease can develop (Koskiniemi, 1993, Mok et al., 1979, Waites and Talkington, 2004). C. pneumoniae, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is frequently misdiagnosed or undetected and is estimated to cause 10\u201315% of atypical CAP infections (Dowell et al., 2001, Marrie et al., 1996, Menendez et al., 1999, Sopena et al., 1999, Welti et al., 2003). Incidence rates may be much higher because approximately 50% of adults have antibodies to C. pneumoniae (Birkeback et al., 2000, Grayston, 1989, Tuuminen et al., 2000, Wan and Grayston, 1990). Legionellae account for approximately 2\u20138% of atypical CAPs, with Legionella pneumophila serogroup (Sg) 1 causing approximately 70% of cases, followed by Sg 2, 4, and 6 along with L. bozemanii, L. longbeachae, and L. micdadei (Bartlett and Mundy, 1995, Fields et al., 2002, Gupta and Sarosi, 2001).",

Several commercially available serologic kits exist for detecting infection with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae; however, none display a high degree of sensitivity or specificity. Moreover, the need for both acute and convalescent patient serum makes this a retrospective test and not ideal for a rapid diagnosis. Urinary antigen tests are routinely used for diagnosis of Legionnaire's disease but only detect L. pneumophila Sg1, thereby allowing for approximately 30% of other Legionella infections to go undetected (Cunha, 2006, Fields et al., 2002).",

Specific real-time PCR assays have been developed to provide a more rapid and reliable method for detecting respiratory pathogens in clinical specimens (Apfalter et al., 2003, Hayden et al., 2001, Mitchell et al., 2009, Winchell et al., 2008). More recently, multiplex (conventional and real-time) PCR assays have also been developed (Gullsby et al., 2008, Loens et al., 2008, McDonough et al., 2005, Miyashita et al., 2004, Welti et al., 2003). Miyashita et al. (2004) designed a multiplex conventional PCR test, followed by Micro-Chip Electrophoresis Analysis, that showed an increase in detection rates over traditional methods. A duplex real-time PCR assay for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae also showed improved detection rates in clinical specimens when compared to conventional PCR (Gullsby et al., 2008). A real-time multiplex nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay, targeting the 16S rRNA region of these organisms, has also been used for detection (Loens et al., 2008). Although only a limited number of clinical specimens were tested, specific detection was achieved in this study, albeit with lower sensitivity. This assay also requires the use of molecular beacons that may pose design challenges and extensive optimization.",

Our multiplex real-time PCR assay offers a sensitive and specific tool for rapid and simultaneous detection of these agents. This assay provides numerous advantages over existing detection methodologies including singleplex real-time PCR assays for detection of these agents. This multiplex assay increases specimen throughput because all 3 agents, along with a control, can be detected in a single tube. This results in faster turnaround time from specimen receipt to result, a feature that may be especially important during respiratory outbreaks in which the initial etiology is unknown. This assay reduces the potential for error in preparation of both PCR master mix and sample addition. Furthermore, the multiplex assay allows conservation of the specimen extract, leading to greater flexibility and opportunity for follow-up or additional testing. Because less specimen volume is required to perform this assay, the extraction procedure may be modified to decrease elution volume, thereby concentrating the extract to further increase sensitivity.",

These data also demonstrate that the intra-assay competition within the multiplex reaction has no negative impact on the detection of these agents. On the contrary, we noticed an overall slight improvement in detection with the multiplex assay. Recent advancements in the formulation of reagents specifically designed for multiplex real-time PCR and improved qPCR instruments have likely added to the success of multiplex assay performance.

When compared to conventional PCR, these multiplex assays had an overall concordance of >98% when testing 73 respiratory clinical specimens. The use of other chemistries for duplex real-time PCR assays for these agents has also been employed (Gullsby et al., 2008, Loens et al., 2008). To our knowledge, our study is the first report of a single-tube, 4-plex real-time PCR assay that is able to detect these CAP agents along with an internal control (RNase P) in clinical specimens. The use of this assay in surveillance studies may provide greater insight into the etiology and prevalence of atypical bacterial pneumonias among a population while also aiding in the rapid identification of the causative agent for CAP outbreaks.
