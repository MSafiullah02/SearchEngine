However, this complex lesion milieu can also make it difficult to delineate effects that are specific to the remyelination process. For this purpose, analysis of oligodendrocyte lineage responses is facilitated by comparison with a simpler lesion model, such as ingestion of cuprizone (14) . Growth factor effects common to experimental lesions of diverse pathogenesis, such as MHV-A59 and cuprizone models, are most likely to be applicable more generally to demyelinating diseases. This chapter will review recent findings of the expression and function of specific growth factors in MHV-A59 and cuprizone models of spontaneous remyelination. In addition, the complexity of the MHV-A59 model will be exemplified by discussion of the modulation of the disease course in correlation with gender and estrous cycle status. This modulation of the MHV-A59 disease course is also relevant to modulation of MS disease activity.",

The length of time that each mouse held onto the bars was recorded, up to a maximum of 60 seconds. Control mice easily grasped the cage top bars with paws, often curled tails around the bars, and moved around to explore while upside-down ( Figure  1A ). In contrast, mice with impaired limb motor function could not grasp cage top bars with paws, rarely curled tails around bars, and dropped off prior to the 60 seconds maximum time limit ( Figure 1B ). Inability to hold on was associated with demyelination, as evident in previous reports of the histopathology of MHV-A59 infected mice (1, 21) . mouse hang time performance over 4 wpi showed that some mice had only mild motor dysfunction while others had severe motor dysfunction ( Figure 2 ). Operational definitions for mild and severe groups can be made several ways. One method is to sum hang times over the disease course, through 4 wpi when many mice have fully recovered. Clustering of subgroups of mice is evident as either a low summed hang time (severe motor dysfunction) or a high summed hang time (mild motor dysfunction). However, to allow mice to be used prior to the recovery phase, a practical set of criteria was needed by 2 wpi. After testing the hang time of mice at 7, 10, and 14 days post-infection (dpi), a mouse that had 2 or 3 hang time values of > 30 seconds o! recovered to a 60 second hang time by 14 dpi was categorized as only mildly affected.

Severely affected female mice were more likely to be in diestrus or metestrus during the early effector stage of the proinflammatory response (4 dpi). Estradiol and progesterone are relatively low at these stages of the estrous cycle. Female mice in proestrus or estrus (at 4 dpi), when estradiol and progesterone levels are elevated, more frequently experienced a milder outcome after MHV-A59 infection. Interestingly, EAE was ameliorated in SJL mice treated with estradiol at a sustained high dose, regardless of the dose of progesterone used in combination (25) . However, the dose of estradiol needed to significantly decrease EAE severity was above levels that occur naturally during the estrous cycle (25) . Thus, the MHV-A59 pathogenesis may be very sensitive to variation of hormone levels during the estrous cycle. 798 Chapter C8 Male mice in this MHV-A59 model clearly had a more severe disease course and higher rate of mortality than female mice. A Thl cytokine response, specifically interferon gamma, is required for clearing of the MHV-A59 virus from oligodendrocytes and resolution of the disease as a model of transient demyelination (18) . Male hormonal conditions favor a bias towards Th2 cytokine production rather than a Thl response (28) , which may correlate with a lack of interferon gamma production in lesions of males and explain the increased rates of mortality compared to females.",

Immunostaining for PDGF-A ligand demonstrated increased expression in reactive astrocytes in remyelinating lesions (21) . In situ hybridization to detect PDGF-A mRNA revealed a 2.9 fold increase in the number of labeled cells in sections from MHV-A59 infected mice vs. PBS-injected control mice (21) . Similar in situ hybridization of FGF2 demonstrated markedly increased signal in reactive astrocytes and microglia localized within and near white matter lesions (17) . Over the course of MHV-A59 disease progression, FGF2 mRNA transcript abundance peaked at 4 wpi as greater than 5-fold over non-lesioned levels (17) . At a corresponding stage in cuprizone demyelination, a similar increase was observed for FGF2 (2) and PDGF-A mRNA (unpublished observation). Interestingly, in both models the increased signal for FGF2 is clearly localized to the lesion while the increase in cells with detectable PDGF-A is much more widely distributed in the tissue. These distributions may indicate differences in the influence of these growth factors on the oligodendrocyte lineage cell response.",

This in vivo distinction among potential roles of FGF2 in differentiation versus proliferation demonstrates that transgenic and knockout mouse models are important for testing growth factor roles in the context of the lesion environment throughout the disease progression. The expression and activity of growth factors, and other regulatory molecules, change throughout the disease course. In addition, the oligodendrocyte lineage population changes with progressive stages of the disease course. Therefore, the effect of a given growth factor on the oligodendrocyte lineage population may vary in vivo during the disease course.",
