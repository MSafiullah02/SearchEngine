            "text": "Research on acute respiratory infections in human populations is limited by certain methodological difficulties. First, their acute nature makes a timely diagnosis difficult. Second, symptoms are usually not unique for specific pathogens. These difficulties impede collecting epidemiologic (e.g., risk factors for acute respiratory infections) and clinical (e.g., the course and severity of infections) data, as well as biosamples for pathogen identification. In particular, the real-time collection of diagnostic specimens such as nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs during an acute respiratory infection season is necessary to link symptomatic data with specific pathogens.1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop epidemiologic research tools that ensure the timely detection of incident acute respiratory infections and the collection of diagnostic biosamples during the episode.",

            "text": "Most epidemiologic studies on acute respiratory infections have been based in medical settings or have been conducted in specific target populations such as trained medical personnel. Data on the occurrence and severity of symptoms have been collected in a few studies only, either retrospectively,2 usually at the end of an acute respiratory infection season, or prospectively, for instance by using diary-based questionnaires.3, 4 Recently, modern communication tools such as weekly e-mails5 and internet-based questionnaires6, 7 have been introduced in population-based studies to collect real-time data on respiratory infections. In a recent study of influenza infection, Short Message Service (SMS) was used in addition to e-mail.8 The main limitation of these studies is the lack of pathogen identification during specific episodes of acute respiratory infections. Nasal swabs for pathogen detection are usually collected by study personnel at the study site or in hospital. However, due to logistic problems and higher costs, this is difficult to organize in population-based studies with their inherently larger sample sizes. In several recent studies subjects were asked to obtain swabs from their own nares (\u2018self-swabbing\u2019) to detect viral respiratory pathogens, but most of these studies were performed in healthcare environments. For instance, parents collected swabs from their symptomatic children when presenting for pediatric medical evaluation,9 or nurses self-swabbed during symptomatic episodes in a study comparing two measures for the prevention of influenza transmission.10 In the UK, swabs for the collection of nasal specimens were sent to individuals who contacted the health advice and information service (\u2018NHS Direct\u2019) because of influenza-like symptoms.11 The only population-based study was conducted among parents who collected nasal swabs from their children at home.12 Thus, the feasibility of nasal self-swabbing for the detection of respiratory pathogens in population-based studies of adults remains to be demonstrated. Moreover, little is known about whether any added benefit results when active symptomatic surveillance is conducted to ensure the timely self-collection of swabs during the time window in which causative pathogens are detectable. We therefore examined the feasibility of combining e-mail-based active symptomatic surveillance with nasal self-swabbing for the detection of viral respiratory pathogens in a prospective study spanning one acute respiratory infection season.",

They received instruction by a physician (S.K.) on how to perform the nasal swab. Briefly, the swab was to be inserted into one nostril to a depth of 1\u20132 cm, rotated three times, and then placed into transport medium. Two kits for nasal swabbing containing a regular flocked swab with molded breakpoint (Copan, Brescia, Italy; product number 359C) and viral universal transport medium were given to the participants. During symptomatic surveillance, weekly automated e-mail messages were sent to the participants containing (1) a reminder to take a swab at the onset of at least one of the above-mentioned symptoms and (2) instructions on how to collect, store, and return the swab. Visual instructions on how to collect the swab were also available on the package. Participants were instructed to store the self-collected swab in the refrigerator (+4 \u00b0C) until returning it, as soon as possible, to the study team.

In the pre-analytical phase, this novel approach turned out to be highly feasible in that acceptance, satisfaction, compliance, and timeliness of logistics were high. Notably, more than 90% of the participants who self-swabbed reported that the swab was easy to obtain and that they preferred self-collection to collection by study personnel. The reason for this high degree of satisfaction may be that self-swabbing reduces duration and frequency of contact with study personnel as well as travel to a study site. The resulting greater convenience would very likely impact positively on compliance in any large-scale prospective study. Another important finding of the presented study is that neither the time between onset of symptoms and self-swabbing nor the time between self-swabbing and specimen arrival at the laboratory influenced the viral detection rate. This agrees well with results from a study in the UK,11 and is noteworthy, since in population-based studies employing self-swabbing, shipping time needs to be included in the time between swab collection and expected arrival of the specimen at the study center.",

The study physician instructed the participants in a standardized manner in the proper application of the technique. We do not believe that an inadequate technique impacted negatively on the rate of pathogen detection, since the detection rate of 50% recorded by us corresponds to what has been reported in other studies employing staff-collected swabs and similar detection technology.13 Also, two recent studies showed that there were no differences in pathogen detection between self- and staff-collected swabs.14, 15 Another factor that may influence the detection rate is the type of nasal swab used for specimen collection. Recently, Smieja et al. developed a flocked nasal mid-turbinate swab and compared it with the gold standard (e.g., rayon nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs). The mid-turbinate swab turned out to provide better results (based on epithelial cell counts) than the gold standard.16 We used a regular flocked swab. Thus, using the mid-turbinate flocked swab might have resulted in a higher detection rate in our study.",

Thus, one immediate strength of using active symptomatic surveillance in population-based studies on acute respiratory infections would be the more efficient identification of individuals with reduced susceptibility to infection, which would constitute an invaluable asset for large-scale studies on genetic determinants of infection susceptibility and resistance in humans. In such a study, using self-swabbing instead of swabbing by study personnel to detect specific pathogens would be immensely attractive due to its anticipated lower cost. Indeed, expenses for personnel and logistics were estimated to be 80% less if self-swabbing was used instead of swabbing by study personnel.17 Previous methods of active symptomatic surveillance have been, for example, weekly telephone calls18 or daily symptom diaries.19 However, these methods might be costly and have lower compliance rates.",

Moreover, due to working in a research institution, the participants could be expected to be more receptive to the study design than the general population. Since e-mail has become the primary tool of communication in professional work environments, including our institution, the population sampled for the present study may have a higher acceptance of modern communication tools than the general population. Further studies are needed regarding the use of electronic communication methods in population-based studies, particularly those targeting the less educated and the elderly. Lastly, due to the unexpected near absence of influenza infection during the study period, we could not evaluate the usefulness of the study design for the detection of influenza infection. Indeed, considering that upper respiratory symptoms occur only in about 60% and fever in about 35% of episodes of influenza infection,20 inclusion of surveillance questions about other influenza-associated symptoms (e.g., myalgia or headache) would likely increase the efficiency of screening for influenza infection with e-mail-based surveillance.",
