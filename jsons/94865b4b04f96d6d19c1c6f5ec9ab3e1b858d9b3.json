Our clinical diagnostic model had a sensitivity of 65% (95% CI: 58%, 72%), specificity of 69% (95% CI: 62%, 75%), and overall accuracy of 68% (95% CI: 64%, 71%), performing significantly better than conventional influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria.",

Determining the clinical predictors of influenza infection is important for the diagnosis and management of patients presenting with respiratory illness, helping to guide appropriate antiviral therapy, and to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. This is particularly important in the young adult population, which constitutes an economically productive age group whereby early treatment may reduce work absenteeism [1] . The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic has shown that young adults have a higher infection rate compared to other age groups [2] . For essential public services such as the military, police, civil defence, and healthcare with substantial proportions of young adults, early recognition and treatment may reduce service disruptions.",

All personnel who visited the primary healthcare clinics in these camps during the main consultation hours with febrile respiratory illness (FRI)-defined as the presence of fever $37.5uC with cough or sore throat-were recruited. The use of FRI contrasts with the usual measure of influenza-like illness (ILI, defined as fever $38.0uC with cough or sore throat); our choice reflected the desire to capture other febrile cases that also result in substantial absenteeism; while limiting cases to those with fever as an indicator of potential severity and absenteeism.",

Univariate comparison of demographic parameters, symptoms and signs was conducted using logistic regression to determine statistically significant parameters of interest. Potential confounding was addressed by performing multivariate analyses where characteristics found to be statistically significant in univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent clinical predictors, with non-significant terms in the multivariate analysis dropped one at a time starting with the highest p-value. To address another source of potential confounding among the remaining variables, we assessed for interactions between these variables but none proved significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 9.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) and R (R Core Development Team). All tests were conducted at the 5% level of significance, with no explicit adjustment for multiple comparisons; instead, where appropriate, we present the expected number of false positive findings under the assumption that all null hypotheses are correct, a strongly conservative assumption. We report odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) where applicable. The final multivariate model for influenza versus non-influenza cases was used to build a predictive probability equation as a clinical diagnostic model to determine the likelihood of influenza infection given the clinical characteristics. For this we developed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve whence the area under the ROC (AUC) was calculated and two cut-off points determined: one maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, the other maximising specificity while keeping sensitivity at 90%. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to guard against over-fitting, with AUC, sensitivity and specificity scores averaged over the ten folds. There were a total of 70 influenza vaccine failures, defined as seasonal or pandemic influenza infections that occurred despite previous vaccination with the relevant seasonal or pandemic vaccine respectively. Of these, there were 43 pandemic H1N1 vaccine failures, although 27 (63%) were vaccinated less than 2 weeks before onset of symptoms; 11 H3N2 vaccine failures, and 16 influenza B vaccine failures. There were no statistically discernible differences in influenza severity (fever $38.0uC or breathlessness) for vaccine failures compared to other influenza cases. Figure 1 shows the number of FRI cases sampled per week, and the proportion of these cases that tested positive for influenza. For the non-influenza FRI cases, 289 (10.1% of all subjects) were diagnosed with coxsackie viruses/echoviruses, 247 (8.6%) rhinovirus, 217 (7.6%) H. influenzae, 130 (4.5%) coronaviruses, 76 (2.7%) parainfluenza viruses, 47 (1.6%) human metapneumovirus, 27 N. meningitidis, 12 S. pneumoniae, 5 adenoviruses, 2 RSV, and 1 bocavirus.",

We re-emphasize that diagnostic tools should be developed in the setting where they are used. Other potential biases include presentation biases from cases which rejected recruitment, presentations after recruitment hours which were not included, and losses to follow-up. Recall biases may exist as we obtained final clinical history two weeks after enrolment into the study, which we felt struck a balance between the risk of recall bias and the desire to capture comprehensively all symptoms during the illness period.
