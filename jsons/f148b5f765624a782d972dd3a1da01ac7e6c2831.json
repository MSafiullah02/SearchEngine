The clinical manifestation of PRRS is complicated but is characterized by severe reproductive losses including abortions, mummified fetuses, weak born and stillborn young, post-weaning pneumonia, increased mortality, and growth retardation of young pigs. The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV) . PRRSV belongs to the family Arteriviridae together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). By comparative genome sequence analysis, PRRSV isolates are divided into two distinct genotypes: the European type (genotype I) and North American type (genotype II), represented by Lelystad virus (LV) and VR-2332 as the prototype virus for each genotype, respectively (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . The sequence similarities between two genotypes are approximately 60% (Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . Amino acid (aa) sequence alignments indicate that the major differences between two genotypes exist in the open reading frame (ORF) 1a region and the structural protein region (Kapur et al., 1996; Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . Natural deletions and insertions are observed in some isolates, especially in the ORF1a region (Fang et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2000; Tian et al., 2007) . The reverse genetics system has been developed for many RNA viruses, and infectious clones have been utilized for the study of biology and the vaccinology of viruses. The availability of such a powerful molecular tool has revolutionized the structure function studies for viral genome and proteins and has facilitated the studies for virulence, pathogenesis, immune responses, and vaccine development. The first full-length genomic cDNA clone was constructed for poliovirus more than three decades ago and its infectivity was demonstrated (Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981) . Infectious clones have since been constructed for picornaviruses, caliciviruses, flaviviruses, togaviruses, influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and coronaviruses to name a few (Almazan et al., 2000; Boyer and Haenni, 1994; Pu et al., 2011; Scobey et al., 2013; Sosnovtsev and Green, 1995; Yount et al., 2003) . For arteriviruses, EAV and PRRSV are the first for which the reverse genetics system has been developed van Dinten et al., 1997) . This review will summarize our current knowledge on the principles of PRRSV infectious clones and the application to the study of arteriviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 228, "text": "(Benfield et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 229, "end": 248, "text": "Chand et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 249, "end": 271, "text": "Murakami et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 272, "end": 293, "text": "Shimizu et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 294, "end": 317, "text": "Wensvoort et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 611, "end": 618, "text": "(PRRSV)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1095, "text": "(Benfield et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1119, "text": "Wensvoort et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1214, "text": "(Allende et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1235, "text": "Nelsen et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1257, "text": "Wootton et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1456, "text": "(Kapur et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1479, "text": "Murtaugh et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1500, "text": "Nelsen et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1617, "text": "(Fang et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1635, "text": "Gao et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1654, "text": "Shen et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1673, "text": "Tian et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2247, "text": "(Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2463, "text": "(Almazan et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2487, "text": "Boyer and Haenni, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2504, "text": "Pu et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2525, "text": "Scobey et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2553, "text": "Sosnovtsev and Green, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 2554, "end": 2573, "text": "Yount et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2680, "end": 2704, "text": "van Dinten et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The PRRSV genome is a single-strand positive-sense RNA of 15 Kb in length with a 5 0 cap and 3 0 -polyadenylated tail (Fig. 1A ) (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) .

Thus, the pp1b portion is expressed always as a fusion with pp1a. The pp1a and pp1ab proteins are further processed to generate 14 non-structural proteins (nsps). The polyprotein processing scheme involves the rapid auto-proteolytic release of three Nterminal nsps, nsp1a, nsp1b, and nsp2, mediated by papain like proteinase (PLP) residing in each of them.

The fusion of the common 5 0 sequence (leader TRS) to the different 3 0 -body segments of sg mRNAs is mediated by discontinuous transcription which is a common strategy of nidoviruses (Sawicki et al., 2007; Snijder et al., 2013; Sola et al., 2011) . During the negative-strand sg RNA synthesis, transcription is attenuated at different body TRS regions of the genomic template. The nascent subgenome-length minus-strand RNA, having an antibody TRS at its 3 0 end, will then move and base-pair with the leader TRS and completes the extension of sg RNA.

Non-retroviral RNA viruses do not undergo a DNA intermediate step in their replication cycle. To obtain a template which can be manipulated by molecular techniques, a full-length cDNA clone is first generated using the reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase. Once generated, two strategies have been established to generate virus progeny from the full-length copy of viral genome: RNA transfection and DNA transfection. In the RNA transfection strategy, viral RNA is synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase coupled with the respective promoter located immediately upstream of the viral genome. The synthesized RNA genome is then introduced into cells to initiate an infection cycle. In the DNA launch strategy, a full-length genomic clone is placed under a eukaryotic promoter such as a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the entire plasmid is introduced to cells for transcription by exploiting the nuclear function of the cell. The transcribed viral genome in the nucleus is exported to the cytoplasm where viral genome translation and replication occur. This strategy omits the steps of in vitro synthesis of genomic RNA and RNA transfection, thus the risk of RNA degradation during transfection is reduced and transfection efficiency becomes consistent ). An arterivirus infectious clone was first made for EAV. The pEAV030 full-length clone containing the 12.7 kb cDNA copy of the EAV genome was infectious (van Dinten et al., 1997) , and the first PRRSV infectious clone pABV437 was developed for the genotype I PRRSV Lelystad virus . Subsequently, infectious clones for VR-2332 which is the genotype II PRRSV, and the European-like genotype I PRRSV SD01-08 circulating in the US was developed (Fang et al., 2006a (Fang et al., , 2006b Nielsen et al., 2003) . Numerous clones have additionally been developed including the highly-pathogenic PRRSV that emerged in China in 2006 (Guo et al., 2013; Lv et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2009) .

An attempt was made to separate overlapping regions of PRRSV structural protein genes, and three restriction enzyme sites were inserted between ORFs 5/6 and ORFs 6/7 (Yu et al., 2009) , which produced viable viruses. The possibility of expressing foreign genes using PRRSV has been explored; the nsp2 gene was utilized as an insertion site for expressions of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and FLAG tag (Fang et al., 2006b; Kim et al., 2007 ). An alternate approach was taken to insert foreign genes within a structural gene; for example, a small portion of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene into the 5 0 or 3 0 end of ORF7 of PRRSV (Bramel-Verheije et al., 2000) . However, the insertion of HA to N gene resulted in a nonviable virus. A strategy utilizing the mechanism of transcription of PRRSV for foreign gene expression is of particular interest. Using an infectious clone, two unique enzyme sites have been introduced between ORF1b and ORF2, and a copy of the TRS6 sequence was inserted to replace the TRS designed to synthesize the mRNA for foreign gene expression (Fig. 4) Pei et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2004) .

These chimeric viruses were viable, and additional chimeric arteriviruses have been constructed (Table 4 ).

The nsp2 protein consists of five regions: hypervariable region I (HV-I), PLP2 cysteine protease core, hypervariable region II (HV-II), transmembrane regions, and a C-terminal tail ( Fig. 2A ; Han et al., 2009) . The PLP2 cysteine protease domain possesses cisacting and trans-acting cleavage activities and mediates its rapid release from pp1a and pp1ab (Han et al., 2009; Snijder et al., 1995) . Two sites were initially predicted for nsp2/nsp3 cleavage at 981G/982G and somewhere at 1196G/1197G/1198G, and recent studies showed the actual cleavage occurs at 1196G/1197G for VR-2332 (Allende et al., 1999; Han et al., 2009; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The corresponding cleavage for EuroPRRSV SD01-08 likely occurs at 1445GG/1447A (Fang and Snijder, 2010) . PLP2 is as a member of the ovarian tumor domain (OTU) family of deubiquitinating enzymes, and has shown to deconjugate ubiquitin (Ub) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 from cellular targets. This is an important viral strategy inhibiting the Ub-dependent and ISG15-dependent host innate immune responses (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2010a Sun et al., , 2012b van Kasteren et al., 2012) Besides the proteinase and deubiquitinase functions, nsp2 contributes to the major genetic differences between genotypes I and II, sharing only less than 40% similarity at the amino acid level (Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The nsp2 gene also contains naturally inserted sequences and deletions ( Fig. 2A) in the hypervariable region (Fang et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2004; Ni et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2000; Tian et al., 2007) . The deletion of 12 amino acids in nsp2 was first found in a Chinese PRRSV isolate, HB-2(sh)/2002, in comparison with other North American isolates (Gao et al., 2004) . Sequence analysis of PRRSV MN184 reveals three discontinuous deletions of 111, 1, and 19 amino acids at the corresponding positions 324-434, 486, and 505-523 of VR-2332, respectively (Han et al., 2006) . Discontinuous deletions were also identified in the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) associated with the 2006 outbreaks of porcine high fever disease in China (Tian et al., 2007) . The 30 amino acids discontinuous deletion consists of 1 aa deletion at position 482 and 29 aa deletions at 534-562, and the deletion region contains Bcell epitopes (de Lima et al., 2006) and T-cell epitopes (Chen et al., 2010b) . Strikingly, cell culture passages of PRRSV may generate a deletion in nsp2, and a study shows the generation of a large deletion of 135 aa at 581-725 in nsp2 during passages (Ni et al., 2011) . A deletion in nsp2 is also found in genotype I PRRSV. The EuroPRRS SD-01-08 virus in the US shows a 17 aa deletion at positions 349-365 of nsp2 when compared to Lelystad virus (Fang et al., 2004) . Biological significance of the genetic deletion in nsp2 remains to be determined. Besides deletions, a 36 aa insertion was also observed in the SP strain of PRRSV, which is a vaccine strain, located between G812 and T849 of the SP nsp2 (Shen et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 308, "text": "Han et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 453, "end": 471, "text": "(Han et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 472, "end": 493, "text": "Snijder et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 683, "end": 705, "text": "(Allende et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 706, "end": 723, "text": "Han et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 724, "end": 744, "text": "Nelsen et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 826, "end": 850, "text": "(Fang and Snijder, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1184, "text": "(Frias-Staheli et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1202, "text": "Sun et al., 2010a", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1222, "text": "Sun et al., , 2012b", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1249, "text": "van Kasteren et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1465, "text": "(Allende et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1486, "text": "Nelsen et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1618, "text": "(Fang et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1636, "text": "Gao et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1653, "text": "Ni et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1672, "text": "Shen et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1691, "text": "Tian et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1859, "text": "(Gao et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2063, "text": "(Han et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2227, "end": 2246, "text": "(Tian et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2435, "text": "(de Lima et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2456, "end": 2476, "text": "(Chen et al., 2010b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2670, "text": "(Ni et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2849, "end": 2868, "text": "(Fang et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3126, "text": "(Shen et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 288, "text": "Fig. 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1570, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Identification of modification-limited genomic regions"}, {"text": "Given the tolerance of deletions and insertions in the hypervirable region of nsp2, this region is considered as a site for foreign gene insertion ( Fig. 2B and C) .

The GFP insertion did not affect the growth of the virus, and the infectivity was comparable to that of parental virus.

The importance of the overlapping gene arrangement for the life-cycle of virus has been studied (Verheije et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2009) . A series of full-length clones were engineered to separate overlapping genes for EAV ORFs 4/5 or ORFs 5/6 by inserting small additional sequences containing a termination codon for the upstream gene, a unique restriction site, and a translation initiation codon for the downstream gene. The insertions result in the functional separation of overlapping ORFs, and do not impair infectivity (de Vries et al., 2000) . The ORFs 5/6 separation in genotype I PRRSV is also possible and progeny virus is produced (Verheije et al., 2002) .

In engineered chimeric viruses using the EAV clone as a backbone, the ectodomains were replaced by corresponding sequences from other arteriviruses. Chimeric viruses containing the GP5 ectodomain from LDV and PRRSV were infectious. These chimeric viruses however retain their cell tropism for BHK-21 cells, which are susceptible for EAV but non-susceptible for LDV and PRRSV (Dobbe et al., 2001) . Replacement of the M ectodomain of EAV with the corresponding sequence from other arteriviruses does not produce infectious virus, but replacement of the M ectodomain of PRRSV with the corresponding sequence from LDV, EAV, and genotype II PRRSV produced an infectious virus. Using the LV infectious clone as a backbone, substitutions with the EAV M ectodomain or VR-2332M ectodomain is impossible, but removal of the gene overlap between the M and GP5 genes is required before swapping, indicating that the VR-2332M ectodomain and EAV M ectodomain are incompatible with the remaining part of LV M. It is also possible that unintended mutations may have been introduced to GP5 during the ectodomain swap (Verheije et al., 2002) . Substitution of structural genes between arteriviruses has been extremely useful to identify viral factors for viral tropism.

Also, the role of individual envelope proteins of GP2 through M for cross-neutralization was studied using the VR-2332 infectious clone as a backbone (Kim and Yoon, 2008) . The PRRSV-01 strain is highly susceptible to serum neutralization and induces atypically rapid and robust neutralizing antibodies in pigs. Analysis of structural genes of PRRSV-01 reveals the absence of two N-linked glycosylation sites each in GP3 and GP5. The significance of missing glycans for neutralization has been determined by replacing GP3 and GP5 genes from PRRSV-01 (Vu et al., 2011) . The major virulence determinants have also been identified by gene swapping experiments to locate in nsp3 through nsp8 and GP5 . Highly pathogenic PRRSV contains the 30 aa deletion in nsp2 sequence (Tian et al., 2007) . By gene swapping studies using nsp2 from an avirulent PRRSV, the deletion in nsp2 was shown to be irrelevant to virulence and pathogenicity (Zhou et al., 2009) .
