The VIDISCA method is based on double restriction enzyme processing of a target sequence and ligation of oligonucleotide adaptors that subsequently serve as priming sites for amplification. As the method is based on the common presence of restriction sites, it results in the generation of reproducible, species-specific amplification patterns. The method allows amplification and identification of viral RNA/DNA, with a lower cutoff value of 10 5 copies/ml for DNA viruses and 10 6 copies/ml for the RNA viruses. Previously, we described the identification of a novel human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, with the use of the VIDISCA method.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "To date, there is still a variety of human diseases of unknown etiology, including several chronic diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but also acute infections such as Kawasaki disease and multiple respiratory diseases (1,2) . A viral origin has been suggested for many of these diseases, emphasizing the importance of a continuous search for new viruses. Identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in patient samples is of great medical interest, but remains a major technical challenge. Identification of novel viral pathogens is difficult with the virus discovery tools known to date. Several problems are encountered when searching for new viruses. First, most of the unidentified viruses do not replicate in vitro, at least not in the cells that are commonly used in viral diagnostics. Second, the molecular biology techniques previously employed to identify unknown viruses have their specific drawbacks. Several techniques are in use for virus discovery, e.g., universal primer PCR, random priming based PCR, and representational difference analysis (RDA). Although every technique has proven to be useful for virus discovery in certain circumstances, they all have serious limitations and restrictions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 271, "text": "(1,2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Universal PCR primers should amplify new members of an already known virus family, but this method has two major drawbacks. First, a choice for a specific virus family has to be made. This limits the possibility of identifying a member of an unsuspected family or the founding member of a totally new one. Second, the universal primers may simply not match the genome sequence of novel members of a virus family. This is illustrated by the lack of success of universal coronavirus primers that were designed before the new members-SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1-were identified. None of the studies that used such primers was able to detect a novel human coronavirus (3,4) . Obviously, such primers gradually improve once more family members are known.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 671, "end": 676, "text": "(3,4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Another technique uses nonspecific amplification of viral sequences in a random priming PCR at low annealing temperatures. However, most ingredients of this assay contain contaminating DNA. For instance, the enzymes used may contain trace amounts of DNA from the bacteria in which they are produced. This contaminating DNA is also amplified and it is therefore not possible to determine at an early stage whether amplification products represent a new virus or contaminating nucleic acids. This can be resolved only after excessive cloning and sequencing. Therefore, high throughput screening of many clinical samples is impractical. Moreover, this technique has only been successful with viruses that replicate in vitro, in which case cell culture supernatant was used as input for the assay (5).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Representational difference analysis (RDA) is a subtractive hybridization technique that enriches for nucleic acid sequences that are present in one tissue but absent or present at lower concentration in an otherwise identical tissue sample. RDA utilizes PCR to generate sets of nucleic acids in a target and a (negative control) tester sample. After subtractive hybridization, there is selective amplification of target-enriched sequences. The method was developed for tissue material and not for nontissue samples such as serum/plasma or virus culture supernatants (6). The fact that these liquid samples have low concentrations of DNA and RNA in the tester sample may restrain the selective amplification of an unknown viral target.

In addition, a DNase treatment is used to remove interfering chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA from degraded cells, whereas RNases in the sample will degrade RNA. During this step, the viral nucleic acid is specifically protected within the viral particle. Next, DNase/Rnases are inactivated and the viral nucleic acids are subsequently extracted from the particles, RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA, and second-strand synthesis is performed to make dsDNA (from a viral RNA or DNA genome). The dsDNA is digested with frequently cutting restriction enzymes that are likely to be present in every viral target (HinP1-I and Mse-I), and HinP1-I-and Mse-I-anchors are ligated to the digested DNA. Essential to the method is that the restriction enzymes remain active during the ligase reaction, thus preventing concatamerization of digested fragments. The anchors themselves are not removed because they are designed in such a way that the restriction site is lost.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 165, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The target is subsequently PCR-amplified with primers that anneal to the anchor sequences, followed by a round of selective amplification with primers that are extended with one nucleotide (G, A, T, or C). Thus, 16 primer combinations are used and each sample is compared to a representative negative control (negative serum, plasma, or supernatant from an uninfected culture). The PCR fragments that are specific to the \"infected\" clinical sample can then be cloned and sequenced. Because amplification is based on the presence of restriction sites, the PCR is reproducible (in duplicate samples the same fragments are amplified) and these PCR products can be distinguished from background amplification.

These results illustrate that the VIDISCA technique has the capacity to identify both RNA and DNA viruses directly from patient material or from cell cultures. In fact, it was the first experiment with a suspected virus culture that led to identification of a novel human coronavirus [HCoV-NL63 (9)]. Only three human coronaviruses were known at that time: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV (10,11), and HCoV-NL63 represents the fourth species.

If one is planning to change the enzyme combination, care should be taken that the combination of restriction enzymes generates restriction fragments from virtually all templates. There is no inactivation step between the digestion and ligation, as restriction activity prevents generation of the concatameric forms of the target templates.

Second PCR-selective amplifications: The second, nested PCR reaction is necessary to provide high specificity and sensitivity. This selective PCR is performed with primers with sequence identical as the standard primers, but with an additional nucleotide on its 3 part. This additional nucleotide is outside the adaptor sequence and thus belongs to the unknown material (Fig. 2) . Use of an additional nucleotide allows separation of the reactions in 16 different primer combinations and enables better analysis of the sample. To have a selectivity that is required when one wants to amplify only those fragments with a 100% match, the thermocycling profile is designed to increase the specificity of reaction by using the starting annealing temperature of 65 \u2022 C, which gradually decreases during first ten cycles to 56 \u2022 C. 5.

The second PCR product is analyzed on agarose gel. Most of generated fragments are less than 300 bp in size. Owing to the need for high-quality separation and small differences in fragment sizes, the MetaPhor agarose is being used (it allows differentiation among fragments varying 1 bp in size). Additionally, the MetaPhor agarose provides an easy setup and high-throughput processing for gel analysis and purification, compared to the polyacrylamide gels. The MetaPhor agarose gel is prepared as described below. 2. 150 ml of 0.5X concentrated TBE buffer is poured into an Erlenmeyer flask and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. 4 g of MetaPhor agarose is weighted and gently poured into the Erlenmeyer flask while mixing. Addition of all agarose powder at once will result in clumping of the agarose. The solution is stirred for another 10 min to soak the agarose grains and heated in the microwave for 60 sec with low power. After the primary heating, the agarose is stirred and heated in 30-sec cycles (low power) with extensive stirring in between. All the agarose is solubilized during a final heating step for 60 sec with medium power. The agarose is cooled down to \u223c65 \u2022 C and 10 l of ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) is added. The agarose is poured into the electrophoresis tray and combs are inserted. It is crucial to remove all air bubbles from the gel (e.g., with a pipette tip). The agarose is solidified at room temperature and further incubated at 4 \u2022 C for at least 20 min (the incubation at 4 \u2022 C improves the gel resolution). The gel is positioned in the electrophoresis box filled with 0.5X TBE buffer 3. 15 l of the second PCR product is mixed with 5 l of the loading buffer and the samples are layered on the prepared agarose gel. 5 l of the 25-bp ladder is used as a DNA size marker. Electrophoretic separation is performed at 150 V for about 1 h. 4. Immediately after the electrophoresis is completed, the gel is analyzed on the UV transilluminator. A picture is taken for analysis and the gel is stored at 4 \u2022 C, wrapped in plastic (Saran Wrap). The picture of the gel is used to search for fragments that are present in the sample of interest and not in the control sample All the fragments that are present exclusively in the sample of interest are marked on the picture (Fig. 3) . If the bands appear very faint on the gel, the PCR products can be concentrated by vacuum centrifuge and reanalyzed on a MetaPhor gel. After fragment selection, the gel is again positioned on the UV transilluminator and the selected bands are excised with sterile razors (about 100 mg per slice) and stored in coded 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 4 \u2022 C (see Note 7). After excision of all bands, a second picture of the gel should be taken to document the proper excision. 5. The DNA fragments from the gel are extracted with the QIAquick gel extraction kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The gel slices are solubilized in 600 l of QG buffer and 100 l of isopropanol is added. After extraction, resulting DNA is dissolved in 30 l of EB buffer. Alternatively, any other gel extraction method may be used. 3. 5 l of suspended E. coli bacteria in BHI medium is added to the PCR mixture. 4. The thermocycling is performed as described in Table 3 . After the PCR is completed, 10 l of the PCR product is mixed with gel loading dye and analyzed on 0.8% agarose MP gel with a Smart ladder DNA size marker. A representative picture of such a gel is shown in Fig. 4 . 5.

Purified DNA is subsequently cloned into a vector and transformed into bacteria. The usual procedure is to use the TOPO cloning kit from Invitrogen (TOPO TA Cloning R Kit Dual Promoter). Cloning is done with 0.5 l of vector, 0.5 l of salt solution, and 2 l of gel purified DNA. Chemically competent TOP10 E. coli (Invitrogen) bacteria are transformed using the TOPO reaction sample (10 l of bacteria per reaction). The E. coli are plated on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicilline. The growth on the LB plates is carried on for 16 h at 37 \u2022 C. Eight colonies per plate are collected with a pipette tip into 50 l of the BHI medium supplemented with ampicilline on the 96-well PCR plate.
