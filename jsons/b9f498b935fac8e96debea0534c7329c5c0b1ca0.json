During the 1990s asthma prevalence and hospital admissions increased in the United States and worldwide. The increase occurred in both males and females and across all ethnic groups. However, the largest increases occurred in children of low socioeconomic status living in urban settings. Recent asthma statistics should be interpreted with consideration of changes made in the method for reporting asthma prevalence ( Fig. 23-1 ) . From 1980 to 1996, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the CDC measured pediatric asthma prevalence as the percentage of children with asthma in the past 12 months. Since 1997, asthma prevalence estimates have been defi ned as: having received an asthma diagnosis, currently having the disease at the time of the interview, and experiencing an attack in the past year. The more specifi c defi nition may have led to a reduction in the number of children reported to have asthma.",

            "text": "Numerous theories have been offered to explain the increase in asthma prevalence over time; many of which continue to be sharply debated. One proposed mechanism is the \"hygiene hypothesis\". This theory assumes natural exposure to microbial infections occurring early in life can cause an organism to develop a natural immunity against asthmatic triggers. A decrease in the number and intensity of exposures in the past century may have placed children at risk of forming less natural immunity to asthma. Despite extensive study, this theory still lacks the scientifi c evidence to move this proposition past speculation. An alternative hypothesis to explain the rise in asthma is based on apparent association between exposure to irritants (i.e. second-hand tobacco smoke, air pollution) and the subsequent development of asthma in childhood. This theory can be extended to early infection with respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus is the most extensively studied), which have been linked to the development of asthma. However, this theory is also speculative, as it is unclear whether the exposure to an asthma trigger during a time of rapid lung growth leads to airway remodeling, or whether the respiratory symptoms that occur with these early exposures are simply the initial presentation of a child who is \"prone\" to the development of asthma.",

Although it is clear that inheritable factors are important to the development of asthma, it is unlikely that a single gene is responsible for this the disease or its response to therapy. A smaller number of genes displaying some effect, either additively or synergistically, is a more plausible explanation. Through case-control studies, family-based association studies, and linkage analysis studies, several candidate genes have been proposed. Two genes that have been investigated extensively are the beta-2-adrenergic receptor gene and the interleukin-4 receptor gene, both of which are located on an area of chromosome 5q. Evidence suggests that polymorphisms of the gene for the b 2 -adrenergic receptor may affect the clinical response to b agonists. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found at codons 16 and 27. Two substitutions may have particular importance. A change at base 46 from adenine to guanine causes a substitution of glycine for arginine at codon (amino acid position)16 and a change at base 79 from guanine to cytosine causes a substitution of glutamic acid for glutamine at codon 27. Patients with the glycine substitution have been found to be prone to beta receptor down regulation and therefore are clinically less responsive to beta-agonist therapy. Although the detrimental effect of the glycine substitution has been questioned, a meta-analysis revealed a signifi cant association between favorable responses to inhaled beta 2-adrenergic agonists in asthmatic children with the native arginine phenotype at position 16 when compared with children with the glycine substitution. The poor response to beta-agonists was most pronounced in African-American asthmatic children with the glycine substitution. Most recently, a signifi cant pharmacogenomic association was found between a SNP in the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) gene and the response to glucocorticoids in asthma.",

Recently, nucleotide polymorphisms for the IL4 receptor (IL-4R) have been identifi ed as a genetic risk factor for severe persistent asthma. Further understanding into the role of IL 4R variants may lead to therapies that inhibit the biological actions of IL-4 by either blocking the receptor (via a monoclonal antibody directed at the receptor) or using a soluble recombinant human IL-4 receptor (consisting of the extracellular portion of human IL-4R) to bind and inactivate freely circulating IL-4.

The fraction of exhaled NO (FeNO) is now moving beyond preliminary research and may become a clinically useful, point-of-care marker of acute as well as chronic asthma.

            "text": "There are many different external and internal stimuli that can incite acute episodes of status asthmaticus. The most well understood mechanism is IgE-mediated allergic asthma . This immediate type of hypersensitivity occurs when IgE molecules bound to resident mast cells interact with the allergic antigen and lead to the infl ammatory response governed by lymphocytes. This stimulus can lead to immediate airway obstruction that is generally shortlived, but can also create a late reaction which can be more severe and persistent. While infections from both viral and bacterial sources can also trigger severe asthma in children, viruses appear to be the major infectious trigger. In the very young child, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfl uenza predominate, while in older children, infl uenza and rhinovirus become more prevalent. Human metapneumovirus and bocavirus have recently been suggested to be viral etiologic factors for acute bronchospastic disease in children. Environmental air pollution , including second-hand smoke, can result in episodes of severe asthma in those children who are predisposed to bronchial hypersensitivity. Some authors suggest that the rise in asthma seen in the past decades is a result of the environmental changes, especially related to ozone. In children, second-hand smoke from caretakers is known to play a major role in triggering status asthmaticus. Exercise is also a very common trigger of severe asthma, especially in the older child. The worsening of airway obstruction generally occurs after the exercise and not during it, and pre-treatment with pharmacological therapies can have some success in preventing exacerbations of exercise-induced asthma. In all age groups, but particularly noteworthy in infants, gastro-esophageal refl ux can produce bronchospasm. The etiology is likely due to direct irritation of the airways by refl uxed gastric material, or alternatively, by neurally-induced bronchospasm secondary to irritation of vagal nerve fi bers located in the distal esophagus. The control of refl ux and gastric acidity remains an important component of asthma treatment. Bronchoconstriction secondary to vagal efferent nerve activity can also be triggered by emotional stress in the older child. This trigger is particularly important when tailoring treatment for a child with asthma. It is possible that an external stimuli such as an allergen commence airway obstruction, but increasing emotional distress can further the severity of the exacerbation. Therefore, the judicious use of low dose sedation may be required in children admitted to the PICU with status asthmaticus who are not mechanically ventilated.",

These medications can stimulate both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, and the beta-1 effects result in the toxicity seen with these agents. Therefore, a relatively selective beta-2 agonist would be preferable. In the United States, albuterol is the most commonly used selective beta-2 agonist. These medications have their effect by stimulation of the beta-2 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, leading to bronchodilation by the adenosine 3 \u00a2 ,5 \u00a2 -cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) mediated pathway. When delivered by aerosol, their effectiveness is dictated by distal drug delivery to the bronchial smooth muscle cells. Therefore, their delivery is dependent upon dose, spontaneous tidal volume, gas fl ow, device used to deliver the gas, and the subject's breathing patterns. Even under ideal conditions only a small percentage of drug actually reaches the target cells. Therefore, dosing must be titrated accordingly. While the use of serial, fi xed-dose, inhaled beta-agonist treatments are appropriate for moderate exacerbation, multiple studies support the use of continuous nebulization in severe cases. This continuous therapy also appears to be well tolerated by the patients, and is less labor intensive for respiratory staff, thereby leading to a degree of cost effectiveness when compared to many intermittent treatments. The adverse effects of the inhaled beta-agonists are mostly related to their beta-1 cardiac effects. Tachycardia is the most common side effect, and is usually well tolerated in children without cardiac disease. Excitability, tremor, and hypokalemia also result from the use of these agents. Albuterol is an equal mixture of the active enantiomer, R-albuterol, and the inactive L-albuterol. Recently, there have been studies investigating levalbuterol, the pure R-isomer for racemic albuterol, in children with asthma. It has been suggested that the use of levalbuterol will have lower cardiac side effects with clinically comparable effi cacy. There is also some evidence that this pure R-isomer results in decreased hospitalization rates in children with asthma. As the cost are markedly higher with levalbuterol, and no studies to date have been performed in the PICU setting, clinicians should use their best judgment in selecting a form of racemic albuterol to utilize in severe asthma in the PICU. The use of inhaled beta agonists should continue if the child requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Delivery via high dose metered dose inhalers can optimize distal drug delivery while on mechanical ventilation.",

Although the diameter of the upper airway is far greater than an individual bronchial, the total cross sectional area available for fl ow is far less in the upper airway. This results in a high velocity chaotic fl ow pattern. The pathophysiologic changes that asthma produces in the lower airway (edema, constriction and mucous plugging) result in a reduction in the cross sectional area available for fl ow. A greater pressure gradient and higher velocities are required to achieve distal fl ow in the setting of bronchoconstriction, and thus, the fl ow pattern becomes turbulent.

The conversion of turbulent to laminar fl ow allows distal gas delivery with a lesser pressure gradient and reduced velocity. Clinically, this results in improvement in gas exchange and a reduction in the work of breathing. Helium/ oxygen mixtures may also inherently improve ventilation as carbon dioxide diffuses at a four times faster rate when compared to an oxygen/nitrogen mixture. These physical characteristics have led to the addition of helium/oxygen mixtures to the armamentarium of asthma treatments. However, further study is needed to determine the impact of helium/oxygen mixtures in children with severe asthma exacerbations. The most benefi cial mixture (i.e. the lowest Reynold's number) will have the highest concentration of helium (80% helium/20% oxygen), but the amount of oxygen required for the patient will dictate the mixture that is tolerated.

Although studies of nebulized therapy with these two medications revealed no difference in either effi cacy or adverse events, some authors believe that there are fewer cardiac side effects with terbutaline.

There are two mechanisms of action of methylxanthines on bronchial smooth muscle cells. They are potent, but non-selective inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases (PDE), including type 4, which is expressed in many of the cells that are key to the development of asthma. Intracellular cAMP is metabolized to AMP by the PDEs. By inhibiting this enzyme, the intracellular concentration of cAMP increases and displays a negative effect on phospholipase C contraction. This leads to decreased bronchoconstriction. In addition, the PDE inhibiting effect is thought to down-regulate the infl ammatory burst from pulmonary infl ammatory cells. The second mode of action occurs via inhibition of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. Despite these two mechanisms and a long history of effi cacy in asthma, these medications are now considered second-line for both chronic asthma therapy as well as during acute exacerbations. One reason for the decrease in use is due to their narrow therapeutic window, in which signifi cant adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, agitation, and tachycardia) can occur with even therapeutic levels. Drug concentrations can also increase or decrease due to multiple interactions with medications that interact with the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Newer generations of mechanical ventilators offer newer modes of ventilation, such as pressure-regulated volume control, which may have some benefi ts over volume-cycled ventilation. The oxygen concentration should initially be set at 100% and weaned as tolerated. The key to deciding on the appropriate respiratory rate and exhalation time is the physical exam. With the patient placed on the initial ventilator settings, the clinician should auscultate breath sounds and visualize chest excursion with each breath. Each positive pressure breath tidal volume should be completely exhaled prior to commencement of the next breath. If not, residual volume from each breath will lead to breath stacking, hyperinfl ation, and an increased risk of pneumothorax and hemodynamic compromise. If the exhaled fl ow is not completed, then either the mechanical respiratory rate must be decreased, or the expiratory time must be increased. However, in order to obtain minute ventilation suffi cient for carbon dioxide removal, higher tidal volumes and peak inspiratory pressures may need to be tolerated. Normal carbon dioxide levels are not necessary and indeed may lead to preventable barotrauma. Clinicians should allow \"permissive hypercapnia\" to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. Pa CO 2 levels as high as 100 mm Hg may need to be tolerated during the early phases of mechanical ventilation.",

These complications include air leak due to positive pressure ventilatory breaths (pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema), nosocomial tracheitis and pneumonia, and mucus plugging and atelectasis. Complications such as pneumothorax and hemodynamic compromise can be limited if plateau pressures are maintained less than 30-35 cm H 2 O and auto-PEEP is less than 15 cm H 2 O. There is also a risk of prolonged weakness that occurs in children ventilated for severe asthma. This myopathy appears to increase with the use of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, both of which are commonly used in children with asthma, as well as with aminoglycoside antimicrobials. The etiology of this myopathy is not presently understood, but may be related to a loss of protein synthesis or altered electrical excitability of muscle fi bers. This weakness can be severe enough to require a physical rehabilitation hospital course once a child is medically ready for PICU discharge. Marked hemodynamic compromise can occur during the course of a severe asthma exacerbation. The cardiopulmonary interactions that occur in the spontaneously breathing child with severe asthma are exemplifi ed as previously noted by the presence of a pulsus paradoxus. In adults, the presence of a pulsus paradoxus in asthma has been correlated with disease severity. While many life-threatening disease processes related to the cardio-respiratory system can cause pulsus paradoxus (cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax), it is best described in severe asthma.",

Once positive pressure ventilation is instituted, left ventricular afterload may be reduced, but it is offset by a marked reduction in venous return in combination with pre-existing hypovolemia, that may result in a dangerous reduction in cardiac output. This decrease in venous return may be exacerbated by the \"auto-PEEP\" frequently encountered in severe asthma. It is often necessary to fl uid resuscitate the asthmatic child upon intubation, with close attention being required to avoid pulmonary edema. If at all possible, volume loading should be initiated in anticipation of intubation. Positive pressure ventilation, by increasing intrathoracic pressure, decreases left ventricular afterload, and therefore, leads to an improved stroke volume and will increase cardiac output as long as preload is constant. Thus, once an asthmatic patient is volume resuscitated, mechanical ventilation may actually improve hemodynamics. Finally, because the work of breathing in severe asthma can result in a lactic acidosis that may decrease cardiac function, mechanical ventilation may improve inotropy by reducing the work of breathing and decreasing anaerobic metabolism.",

A few hours into his admission he is becoming progressively more lethargic and his respiratory distress persists.

His vital signs reveal a temperature of 38.8\u00b0C, a heart rate of 160 bpm, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/ min, and a blood pressure of 125/82 mm Hg. His air exchange is fair with expiratory wheezing and marked retractions. He has bounding pulses. The nurse reports that he has anisocoria with his right pupil 7 mm and his left 4 mm. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate course of action? A. Perform a more thorough neurologic exam, and if reassuring, continue his current care with frequent monitoring of his neurologic exam and serum drug levels. B. Perform a more thorough neurologic exam, and if reassuring, decrease the dose of albuterol and/or ipratropium as their combined effect may be resulting in a tachydysrhythmia that is potentially compromising organ perfusion.
