He served in 1959 as special advisor to the federal Justice Minister of Canada and then moved to practice law in Montreal returning to Ottawa in 1967 as an advisor in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office under Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. He remained when Pierre Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada in 1968, serving as Principal Secretary. Lalonde entered federal politics in 1972, was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Quebec, and joined the Cabinet as Minister of National Health and Welfare. During 1972\u201377 he served as Minister of National Health and Welfare and in 1974 published a landmark document A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians that brought him international renown. This document was the cornerstone for the reconceptualization of public health policy, as it has evolved since its publication.",

The New Perspective document introduced what was called the Health Field Concept that health is a result of four major elements: human biology, health care systems, environment, and lifestyle. In Canada, and many other countries, the focus of health policies in those days was on health insurance for hospital and medical care. Public health was marginal in priority, but awareness was growing from research on smoking and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as emerged from research in Britain on smoking, lung cancer, and the many other studies of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (see Chapter 14). The landmark publication of the US Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Smoking in 1964, the Framingham study in Massachusetts, and others indicated that many of the key risk factors for disease were due to lifestyle issues, i.e. personal habits influenced by societal factors including diet, smoking, and exercise as well as access to medical care. New Perspectives proved to be a major contribution to public health policy generally providing the basis for the health promotion movement which became a fundamental element of current public health globally.",

The level of a population\u2019s health was, justifiably, seen as dependent on access to and the quality of medical care. However, as a consequence, health policy was directed toward acute care hospital and physician-centered expenditures. Emphasis in Canada was on provincial Medicare plans of universal coverage hospital and medical insurance plans, and their financing with federal standards and cost sharing. Health promotion and disease prevention were of lower priority in Canada at that time, lacking schools of public health and a federal equivalent of the US Centers for Disease Control, with lack of political, media and public attention and public financing for public health (see Chapters 8 and 15Chapter 8Chapter 15).",

To reach a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment.

The wider view of health, frankly addressed the importance of self-imposed and socio-economic and environmental risks as major factors in population health. The data clearly showed the main causes for morbidity and mortality related to preventable conditions. Considering that the Canadian health system was already one of the most advanced and accessible health systems at the time, Lalonde called for a wider holistic view of health with a focus on moderating self-imposed health risks, improving the environment and considering human genetics, as well as classical health care systems. In an acceptance speech to the PAHO meeting in 2002 on the 28th anniversary of the publication of New Perspectives awarding him the honor \u201cPublic Health Hero of the Americas,\u201d Lalonde put the issue this way:\u201cIt is important to reassert the fundamental validity of the Health Field Concept and the interrelationship between its four components: human biology, environment, lifestyle, and health care organization. Although conceived in the context of an economically advanced country, the strength and the appeal of the Health Field Concept are its universal application. The specific plans of action would obviously need to reflect local conditions, but the general strategies are capable of application in developing as well as developed countries. New Perspective cannot be dismissed as a document of interest only to rich countries. If we really want to improve the health of our citizens, we cannot concentrate only on the health care organization.\u201d\n",

The \u201cLalonde doctrine\u201d was criticized as deficient in unequivocal scientific evidence which would justify taking action against potentially harmful factors. The main challenge came from the health sector complaining of unsatisfactory evidence in certain issues. But at the same time, a growing flood of epidemiologic evidence identified risk factors and successful methods of intervention to prevent disease or consequences of disease such as smoking reduction, control of hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise and others (see Chapter 14). New Perspectives was also criticized as overemphasizing lifestyle with little attention to environment including poverty, education, housing and other social inequalities. Moreover, health in Canada is a provincial responsibility, while the federal level had no clear public health structures to implement the recommendations of the report. Lessons learned later in Canada from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic led to development of the federal Public Health Agency of Canada, created in 2004 to develop capacity to anticipate and respond effectively to public health threats and to promote disease prevention. Similarly, in the same time period many regional laboratories and schools of public health sprang up across the country with a new public health orientation.",

HIV/AIDS was the classic case, but this was followed by hepatitis C and other conditions for which care was essentially palliative. In the early years of the AIDS pandemic, preventive care depended on health promotion initiatives to change unsafe sexual behavior and illicit drug practices to reduce transmission and stem the spread of the pandemic, with education, condom and needle distribution. This was the case while millions died of HIV/AIDS until the late 1990s when effective biomedical measures became available using powerful new classes of antiretroviral life saving drugs for treatment and prevention of transmission. Health promotion measures were the only real option in the form of partnership with the most vulnerable gay community in dealing with the growing pandemic of HIV and illicit drug use. Even in the second decade of the 21st century, health promotion is vital in AIDS control to promote preventive treatment for HIV-positive pregnant women and to reduce backsliding on safe sex practices among treated AIDS patients to reduce reappearance of other sexually transmitted diseases thought to have been controlled.",

It has drastically reduced others such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis and even neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as onchocerciasis (river blindness), dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease), leprosy, and others. Since the period following World War II, evidence of new methods of interventions to reduce the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer by lifestyle and nutritional measures, and improved medical care, have shown remarkable success in reducing stroke, coronary heart disease mortality, and mortality from cancer of the lung, cervix, liver, stomach, and colon-rectum. The classical Germ Theory is represented in the epidemiologic triangle in Figure 21.1\n. Figure 21.2\nrepresents the transition of single causation of disease to a multifactorial paradigm including genetics, personal life habits, and a broad range of other societal factors including socio-economic and physical environmental conditions. This might be seen as a transition from a purely biomedical model to a \u201crenewed miasma theory,\u201d including sanitation, and an entire range of new health policy and Social Medicine as pioneered in the 19th century by Rudolph Virchow in Germany. Finding common ground in a much broader holistic range of risk factors for the host-agent-environment paradigm has emerged with this transition stimulated by the Health Field Concept supported by great progress in evidence from epidemiology, medical sciences, and public health experience of success. The two figures represent the epidemiologic transition, which is often focused on evolution of predominance of infectious diseases to overwhelming dominance of noninfectious diseases over the past century.",

The European Union has articulated a similar position for high-income countries that health investment improves economic growth (Suhrke and McKee 2006). This concept influenced the global consensus on the Millennium Development Goals and the follow-up Sustainable Development Goals. The burden of illness and its cost are high whether the payment is private, or by health insurance through place of work, or by governmental insurance or service systems (see Chapters 8 and 15Chapter 8Chapter 15). Many diseases once thought to be treatable but not preventable are now avoidable by self care, community action or by medical care whether immunizations or treatment of hypertension. The economic gains of preventing disease or the complications of disease are enormous. Investment in prevention thus gains economic rationale. This applies in countries at all economic levels. A payment system that covers medical care but excludes preventive services or public health promotion is behaving irrationally from an economic viewpoint. Thus health insurance systems adopt new methods of screening for cervical or colo-rectal cancer as part of their benefit system.",

Three of the eight goals established by consensus of 190 countries are specifically on health topics: reducing child mortality; reducing maternal mortality; and, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The other goals are reducing poverty; achieving universal primary education; reducing gender inequality and empowerment of women; ensure environmental sustainability; and, development of a global development partnership. The MDG achievements between 2000 and 2015 were remarkable, particularly in reducing poverty, child mortality, maternal mortality, increasing education accessibility especially for girls, access to safe water, management of HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and others. This was achieved by the consensus of nations on the issues and building public\u2013private cooperation between nations and donors, international aid and recognition that education, the social and physical environments, and public health are the crucial issues. The initiative was followed by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015\u201330) which are even broader in scope, but recognizing that health is part of, and dependent on, many factors including access to medical care, again widely credited internationally in large part due the intellectual legacy of Marc Lalonde and the Health Field Concept of the New Perspective. The economic rationale for investment in prevention of chronic diseases is that there is proven track record of reducing cardiovascular and cancer deaths by relatively inexpensive intervention including those of health promotion, such as smoking and alcohol reduction, and those of biomedical intervention, such as low-dose aspirin, blood pressure control, immunizations, and nutritional fortification of basic foods. Cost utility studies for individual preventive interventions have become a necessary analysis for policy determination of priorities. WHO estimated in 2005 that an additional 2% reduction in chronic disease death rates worldwide, per year, over the next 10 years would prevent 36 million premature deaths by 2015, stating that the scientific knowledge to achieve this goal already exists (WHO, 2005). Global burden of disease studies indicate that behavioral, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of the global mortality providing many opportunities for prevention (Global Burden of Disease, 2015).\n",

This has implications for resource allocation and recognition of demographic and epidemiologic changes as well as important additions to public health capabilities with new vaccines to prevent infectious diseases and cancers, for example.
