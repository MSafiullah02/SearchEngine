Almost all European countries have closed their schools (Sweden is an exception) to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and according to UNESCO, 91% of children have been impacted worldwide.5 Schools throughout the UK closed in March 2020 (see Box 2) and are only providing places for some primary school children of key workers and some vulnerable children. Uptake of these places in the latter group appears to be low.6 Some schools are providing learning online, but completion rates are unknown, particularly for those children with no or limited access to the internet. Children from poorer families have fewer resources, may be reliant on school meals and playgrounds for exercise, are less likely to have appropriate access to the internet/sufficient space to allow learning, or have access to additional resources to support other activities for mental or physical well-being. Children with special educational needs and disabilities should have the special provision required to meet their particular needs specified in their Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP). This has not necessarily been adapted for home learning and many EHCPs specify provision that cannot be delivered outside of specialist settings. Similarly, much of the wider support normally available to disabled children and other vulnerable learners is provided through facilities that are now closed and unlikely to be effectively replaced by efforts of volunteers.",

The stress and anxiety caused by forced isolation, economic uncertainty, home schooling and potentially difficult living conditions drive the increase in abusive and controlling behaviour. In over a third of families where DVA occurs, there is also direct child maltreatment: physical and emotional abuse, exploitation and neglect.13 The greatest risk will be to vulnerable children (defined in Box 1). Although the government has issued guidance in relation to COVID-19 and DVA, there is no mention of exposed children and young people.11 Moreover, as children\u2019s services and DVA agencies scramble to change their working practices to remote support, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of emergency methods of working in this field.",

A variety of parental interventions, Looked After Children Reviews, social services input and respite care can improve children\u2019s outcomes.17 Throughout the UK, these services have been suspended or reduced as social services move to working from home meaning that children and foster carers can no longer access face-to-face support from their appointed social worker or their independent reviewing officer. Respite care has generally been suspended, increasing the risk of physical, emotional abuse or neglect in families that are struggling. Where looked after children were receiving additional support from CAMHS, this has either stopped or is being continued remotely. Inevitably, these reductions in support and safeguards will have the greatest impact on the children with the most complex needs in the most challenged placements. Transition planning for children leaving care has largely been suspended. Services that were already struggling with workforce issues are now struggling even more as recruitment is almost impossible currently because of practical and economic considerations.",

Several strategies have been suggested to reduce the risks of domestic violence including the organisation of safe spaces in hotels for women and children experiencing DVA, already implemented in Spain and France. Improving video and online access to services for which there is some evidence of effectiveness (such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) from CAMHS) could improve children\u2019s resilience. The chronic underfunding and workforce crisis in social care and the domestic violence sector will only be exacerbated by the current emergency. The chancellor\u2019s recognition of the need for greater financial support of the NHS18 should be matched with additional support to local authorities. CAMHS and social services for children are unlikely to be needed on the front line for COVID-19 and agile services could develop alternative methods to assess and treat children using video clinics. The physical and mental health needs of the UK\u2019s children are unlikely to be short term, and funding will need to continue well after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Perhaps more importantly, we all have a responsibility to promote the health and well-being of children at home, and to ask questions and fight for service provision in areas where clinicians are not needed to fight COVID-19, but are needed to protect children.",
