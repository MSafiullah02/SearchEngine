We have demonstrated previously, in a prospective survey of the use of dedicated isolation facilities in a UK teaching hospital, that this is not always the case.3 This survey showed, for example, that one-third of patients admitted to a dedicated isolation room were not thought to be an infection risk by experienced healthcare staff.",

Although approximately 80% of patients were deemed to have been admitted appropriately according to our local admission guidance (Table I), many of these patients had low-risk infections, with less than half of all patients thought to be an infection risk. In contrast, prior to the transfer, 90% of patients would have been admitted appropriately according to the admission guidance, with over two-thirds of patients thought to be an infection risk. This deterioration appears to be due to three main factors. Firstly, a higher proportion of isolated patients had low-risk infections, in particular, lower respiratory or urinary tract infections. Secondly, a higher proportion of patients had non-infection, general medical diagnoses. Thirdly, there was a fall in the proportion of patients with gastroenteritis. Whether the latter represents a true reduction in incidence or a change in referral pattern is unknown. Further investigation is merited to ensure that patients with infectious diarrhoea are not being housed inappropriately on open wards.",

From our own experience and that of others, it would seem unlikely that other more appropriate (i.e. higher-risk) patients were not available for transfer either from the medical admissions unit or other parts of the hospital. Unpublished audit data from our own hospital have suggested that if side and isolation rooms were used more appropriately, the vast majority of patients deemed to be at high risk of transmitting an alert infection could be housed in a side or isolation room. Such findings highlight the difficulty of implementing ideal infection control practice in a \u2018real-world\u2019 environment.",

Although our local guidance for admission of patients to isolation accommodates some lower-risk infection patients, such as those with severe community-acquired pneumonia, the increased proportion of patients with low-risk diagnoses is likely to represent the common misconception that infection units are for patients with any infection. Following this audit, one of the senior infection unit staff attends the medical admissions unit on a daily basis to liaise with the admitting medical team and nursing staff, and to assess and prioritize admission to the infection unit. Anecdotally, this approach appears to have improved the use of isolation beds, although further audit will be required to confirm this.",
