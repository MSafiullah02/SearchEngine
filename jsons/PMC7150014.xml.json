The term \u201cinfection\u201d is derived from the Latin inficere meaning to taint. What is tainted is the coherence of the metaself (self + symbiotes\u2014cf. Chapter 5) and the metastable functioning of this terrain. From this unitary definition, we derive the actors in the dyad: the nonself organism (the infector) and the terrain of the aggressed organism(s) (the infected). Infections are the dynamic of the virulence of the infector relative to the adaptive capabilities of the infected. The greater the virulence is, and the less competent adaptive capabilities are, the greater the risk of infection. Since the time of Koch and Pasteur, the exclusive line of evaluation and treatment has been the infector, with no consideration for the terrain of the infected. This is like while having a hole in one\u2019s roof and clogged gutters on a rainy day, focusing on dispersing rain clouds rather than fixing the house.",

Among the infectious diseases presented here, few have been shown to be effectively managed with antibiotics as first-line treatment in uncomplicated cases. There is, then a quandary which the physician faces. To use antibiotics may induce harm and is likely not effective. To not treat leaves the patient suffering and is a burden on the family, work and thus on society as a whole. If not this, then what to use? We have found in our nearly five decades of clinical practice the rational clinical usage of medicinal plants quite effective. They can be applied symptomatically, to the critical terrain, or pre-critical terrain to prevent recurrent infections. The approach laid out involves both anti-infectious treatments and drainage, but also regulation of the neuroendocrine determinants of the infectious terrain. In the out-patient population, this approach proves efficient and compassionate to alleviate the burden faced by the patient.",
