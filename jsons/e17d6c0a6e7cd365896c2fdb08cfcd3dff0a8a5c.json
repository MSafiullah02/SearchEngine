TCoV has been associated with poult enteritis complex, a syndrome that severely affects turkey production. No medical prophylaxis exists to control TCoV, therefore sanitary measures such as cleaning and disinfection are essential. It is thus important to evaluate temperatures that allow persistence of TCoV in the environment. Two series of aliquots of a suspension of a French isolate of TCoV (Fr TCoV) were stored at room temperature or '48C for 0 to 40 days. As TCoV does not grow in cell culture, the presence of residual infectious TCoV in the stored samples was tested by inoculating embryonated specific pathogen free turkey eggs. As TCoV does not induce lesions in the embryo, virus replication in the jejunum and ileum of the embryos was detected 4 days post inoculation, using RNA extraction and a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based on the nucleocapsid gene. No surviving virus was detected after 10 days storage at '21.691.48C or after 40 days storage at '4.191.68C, these temperatures being representative of the mean summer and winter temperatures, respectively, in the major French poultryproducing region. The relatively short survival of the virus at room temperature should contribute to limited virus survival during summer months.

In addition, the '48C temperature is likely to be comparable with temperature during refrigerated shipment of unfrozen biological samples. However, our study does not mimic the survival of virus in litter or dried faeces, and so forth, where relative humidity is different. The use of a virus suspension, instead of dried viruses on surfaces, decreased the risk of titre variation, simplified the study, and gave consistent data. This simplified protocol was all the more interesting as this virus does not grow in cell culture, requiring a multi-step procedure for titration of the virus, comprising embryonated SPF turkey eggs, embryo dissection and real-time RT-PCR. Another significant improvement would have been to start with a virus titre initially higher, in order to obtain values of decrease in virus titre on a larger scale.

Indeed, the strain used in this study (080385d) was isolated from a diseased flock in November, usually a rather cold and humid period in western France. However, this may not reflect the seasonality of enteric disorders in France. In their survey of 81 French turkey flocks, performed during the period 2007 to 2009, Maurel et al. (2009) detected 24 flocks positive for Fr TCoV. Fifteen of these flocks (63%) were detected during warm periods (spring\u00c1summer), as compared with only nine flocks (37%) in autumn and winter. Although this survey was not designed to precisely assess seasonality of Fr TCoV infections, the annual distribution of PEC reports to the French Nationwide Network for Epidemiological Observations in Poultry (RNOEA) (Souillard et al., 2007) confirms that the proportion of PEC cases declared from 2007 to 2011 was higher during the warmer periods (77% of the total declared PEC cases) than during the colder ones (23% of the total reported cases) (Toux & Souillard, personal communication, 2011) . The period of highest PEC incidence hence appears not to be the most favourable for Fr TCoV survival in the environment. However, it should be remembered that PEC is a multifactorial syndrome, so that the reported PEC cases may be caused by a variety of agents (Fr TCoV, astroviruses, reoviruses, adenoviruses, bacteria, etc.), some of which may account for additional summer cases. Furthermore, the survival of Fr TCoV is only one possible factor that might contribute to the seasonality of the disease, and other possibly more significant interfering factors, such as possible vectors or seasonality of turkey production, might also play a role, so that Fr TCoV virus survival according to the outdoor temperature might not be the most important parameter for its transmission between turkey flocks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 509, "text": "Maurel et al.
