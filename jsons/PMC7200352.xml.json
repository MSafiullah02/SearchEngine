Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure were seen in the ER and then admitted to ICU facilities for further treatment [1]. The causative pathogen was later identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by World Health Organization (WHO), or SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) on February 12, 2020, or human coronavirus 19 (hCoV-19) by a group of virologists in China [2]. The WHO announced coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) as the official name of the disease. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, and human-to-human transmission had been occurring among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 [3]. WHO declared COVID-19 as pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of April 22, 2020, a total of 2,475,723 cases had been confirmed globally, with 169,151 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses, which are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses, belong to the family Coronaviridae. They are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals [4]. Previously, six coronavirus species were known to cause human disease, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5]. The first four species caused only mild symptoms, but SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused more than 10 thousand cumulative infections in humans in the past two decades with mortality rates of \u223c10% for SARS-CoV and \u223c34% for MERS-CoV, respectively [[6], [7], [8]]. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh number of the family of coronavirus that can infect humans [9]. Although the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, its transmissibility (median R0: 5.7) is much higher than that of either MERS-CoV (R0: <1) or SARS-CoV (R0: 3) [10]. Genome sequencing analysis of clinically isolated samples from patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 shares 88% nucleotide similarity with two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, but has only around 79% and 50% identity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [11]. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses encodes four major structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16), plus five to eight accessory proteins [12]. Among them, SARS-CoV-2 uses S protein to bind its host cell membrane receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for virus entry (Fig. 1\n) and subsequent pathogenesis [13]. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that bats might be the primary reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 [14], while the intermediate host is still under investigation. The rapid worldwide expansion of SARS-CoV-2 calls for smart POCT diagnostic approaches, safe and effective vaccines, as well as novel therapeutics, to detect, prevent and cure COVID-19 infection. Here, we highlight the safety and effectiveness of vaccines with respect to Dr. Shibo Jiang\u2019s recent appeal that safety be foremost on the minds of vaccine developers as they begin to engage in preclinical and clinical trials to tackle SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Here we briefly summarize current diagnostic approaches and development of vaccines and therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Up to now, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected from clinical specimens analyzed by electron microscopy, cell culture, real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing [9]. Molecular tests for rapid detection of the causative virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients; meanwhile, RT-PCR, which combines the reverse transcription of RNA and amplification of specific cDNA regions, remains the primary means of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 [16]. Normally, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, urine or stool samples are collected form suspected patients. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for SARS-CoV-2 detection [17]. The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between December 29, 2019 and January 4, 2020. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs were collected. After RNA extraction, an RT-PCR assay was performed to amplify the genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing confirmed that the family was, indeed, infected by SARS-CoV-2 [18]. Prof. Poon\u2019s group developed two 1-step quantitative RT-PCR assays to detect the ORF1b and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The assays were evaluated using a panel of positive (RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus) and negative controls. The detection limits were found to be below 10 copies per reaction, and samples from two SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were positive in the tests [19]. Samples from all collections contained sputum, as well as nose and throat swabs, with or without viral transport medium. RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed to amplify the RdRp, E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The assays were highly sensitive and specific because they did not cross-react with other coronaviruses [20].",

This method also requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients, which poses a risk of transmission [17]. Consequently, neither nasopharyngeal nor oropharyngeal specimens are ideal for serial monitoring of viral load. One study used saliva to screen respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without fever or respiratory symptoms [21]. Prof. Yuen\u2019s group collected saliva from 12 Hong Kong patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, and the novel coronavirus could be detected in the saliva specimens of 11 patients (91.7%) by in-house one-step real time RT-qPCR assay targeting the S gene [17], suggesting that saliva could be a practical noninvasive specimen type. Several rapid diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 detection are now commercially available. Among them, one is from the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI). It can detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies, and it has been approved for clinical use [16].",

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified, and it was further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor compared to binding between SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 [31], suggesting that the RBD-based SARS-CoV vaccines have the potential to be developed for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections. RBD-based vaccines are now under development by several organizations through international collaborations [32].

Among the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, S fragments, such as S1-NTD, RBD and S2, can be considered as targets for nAb development [12]. Polycloncal human immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from transgenic cows has been tested successfully for MERS-CoV in animal models [54], and this strategy has been tested for safety in clinical trials (clinical trials.gov: NCT02788188). Because of the high identity of the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibodies was tested on SARS-CoV-2, and it was found that only CR3022 bound potently with SARS-CoV-2 [55], indicating that CR3022 might be a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of COVID-19 infections. Cocktails consisting of antibodies specific for RBD and other regions in the S protein can be considered to further improve the breadth and efficacy of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection [12].",

            "text": "Studies have also revealed that some coronavirus entry inhibitors have potential to be developed for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The peptides derived from the HR2 domain of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV [56], MERS-CoV [6] and SARS-CoV-2 [57, 58], have been shown to be effective against the fusion, entry and replication of the corresponding coronavirus. A pan-corovirus fusion inhibitor (EK1) were reported to be highly effective against divergent human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL-63, and SARS-CoV-2, as well as several bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) [58, 59]. A series of lipopeptides derived from EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain, were highly potent in inhibiting entry and infection of divergent human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. For example, the lipopeptide EK1C4 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion with IC50 of 1.3 nM [57]. Therefore, these peptides have great potential to be further developed as a therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of the current SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infection and future emerging and reemerging coronavirus infections.",

Another trial (NCT04304053) is looking at the efficacy of a durunavir/cobicistat plus choroquine treatment [60]. Chinese herbal medicines, such as Radix Sophorae and Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidati, may contain agents against SARS-CoV-2 [42]. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatments is also promising. Nonetheless, the efficacy and safety of all these potential candidates in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials. However, development of safe and effective COVID-19 therapeutics is often hampered by the lack of valid COVID-19 animal models for evaluation their in vivo safety and efficacy [61].",

Quickly identifying a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to control the continuing spread of the virus. The noninvasive specimen collection strategy has the advantage when collecting clinical specimens. It cannot be overstated that both vaccine development and investigation into potential drugs are subject to further studies to validate safety and efficacy, including, for example, immunization strategies, adjuvant selection, or establishment of animal models. International collaborations, or consortia, will promote COVID-19 and move vaccine development forward. Safety evaluation of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount, and this issue is related to the type of vaccines to be selected and immunogens to be designed. Potential therapeutics include lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, CP and polyclonal/monoclonal antibodies. Again, however, clinical trials are needed for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating COVID-19.",
