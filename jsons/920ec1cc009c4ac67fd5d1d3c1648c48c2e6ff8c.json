Their diets, therefore, restrict each species to specific microhabitats (identifiable structural features used by hoverfly larvae such as plant debris, foliage or cow dung) during larval development.

The Syrph the Net database , which contains data on the ecological traits of hoverfly species, has facilitated community-level analyses for hoverflies.

Species richness and abundance of saprophagous hoverflies were not affected, in the context of our study, by parameters related to larval wetland macrohabitats, but the abundance and species richness of aphidophagous hoverflies decreased with distance to forests. One other study has shown that landscape context affects differently according to hoverfly ecological traits (Schweiger et al., 2007) ; in this study, the main traits influencing response to landscape structure were degree of specialisation in habitat or in feeding. Aphidophagous species were probably more affected by landscape structure than saprophagous wetland species, because they need different resource patches for larval and adult stages. Such species require different landscape elements at different life stages (Dunning et al., 1992) and thus are particularly dependent on landscape heterogeneity (Fahrig & Nuttle, 2005) . This sensitivity will depend on the interaction between heterogeneity and dispersal capability. Because we observed no aphidophagous species farther than 500 m from spruce plantations, we suppose that distance limited adult dispersal to heathlands. Some studies have found a low dispersal capability for aphidophagous forest species (Wratten et al., 2003; Herrault et al., 2016) . Our results showed that, in this range, adult dispersal varied according to species, as some forest species were mainly found in forest-dominated landscapes at close proximity to forest edges (M. cinctella and P. albimanus), while others were abundant in wetland-dominated landscapes at larger distances from forest edges (Parasyrphus lineolus, Epistrophe grossulariae and Episyrphus balteatus).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 519, "end": 543, "text": "(Schweiger et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 934, "end": 956, "text": "(Dunning et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1043, "text": "(Fahrig & Nuttle, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1401, "text": "(Wratten et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1424, "text": "Herrault et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Contrasting responses according to ecological group"}, {"text": "We showed that Belgian heathlands are habitats where diverse hoverfly species, especially species from forests, can feed on flower resources.
