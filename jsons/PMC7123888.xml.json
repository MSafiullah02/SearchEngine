            "text": "Martyn Sama and Vinh-Kim Nguyen hold the view that all societies have had health systems \u201cof some sort\u201d as long as people have tried to protect themselves against diseases. Systems, they say, can be defined as those traditional practices, \u201coften integrated with spiritual counseling and providing both preventive and curative care,\u201d which have \u201cexisted for thousands of years and often co-exist today with modern medicine,\u201d often undergoing consistent changes (Sama and Nguyen 2008: 3). Their thesis is the more relevant as they refer to African stewardship and the crisis the health system is experiencing virtually everywhere on the continent. They point out that effective stewardship is the government\u2019s key role in oversight and trusteeship, which involves formulating health policy, defining the strategic vision clearly, and articulating the direction the leadership wishes to see the health system follow. This is strengthened by exerting influence and vocalizing in word and action the approaches to regulations guiding the health system, and collecting and using intelligence (data and information) effectively. In sum, stewardship implies vision, \u201coverall system design and policy formulation; setting priorities, and \u201cperformance and impact assessment for outcomes, promotion of health and advocacy; and establishment of norms, standards, and ethical framework.\u201d In their assessment, the two authors note that African systems are among the \u201cmost bureaucratic and least effective managed institutions in the public sector. The ministries are fragmented with vertical programs, or ritual chiefdoms, dependent on certain donor funding.\u201d The description could not be more accurate to anyone who has visited an African hospital to be treated, as chapters in this volume emphasize, ranging from an uncountable absenteeism to unauthorized financial charges by doctors that circumvent the official care provision in public and private health facilities to delays of treatment on alleged equipment failures. Sama and Nguyen thus further sharpen their analysis of African health systems and their stewardships:If African health systems are ungovernable, it may be in part because powerful international donors work at cross-purposes, setting competing agendas, cycling policies at a rate that defies bureaucratic assimilation, fragmenting health efforts, and undermining local systems of accountability\u2026There is recognition that accountability, transparency, and vigorous citizenship participation are essential to achieving a viable society, sustainable economic growth, and equitable distribution of benefits and risk of growth. Yet, African countries are characterized by persistent and in many cases worsening social, economic, and gender, and health inequalities. (Sama and Nguyen 2008:10) (author\u2019s emphasis)\n",

Health systems also encompass shifting systems of social solidarity that insure against risk: there may be private health insurance for a few and some free health services here and there, but it is mainly extended social networks (which may be more or less based on varying notions of kinship) that insure against health risks.

Yet this did not help the situation, even with the efforts to expand insurance coverage to as many people as possible, including those without employment. This study also revealed that there were several and serious gaps in the Kenya health system, estimated at close to 20\u201335% of the total population, namely, only those who contribute to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), while the rest qualify only for \u201cmore traditional insurance, and need to be enrolled in some flexible risk-pooling schemes.\u201d The Kenyan health system, like most in Africa, suffers from the following serious shortcomings (Anangwe 2008: 57):",

Indeed, the present picture of health does not ensure a good prognosis of the future, where, it seems, the more things change the same they remain. Many leaders in Africa and other parts of the world do not realize, as ECOSOC (2009: 32) has noted, that history shows that \u201c\u2026inequities in health are not the same as inequities in health care. Inequities in health care are of vital importance, but the major determinants of the inequities in health are [found], as the UN Secretary-General once said, in the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.\u201d These therefore are factors that the leaders must always keep in mind. Perpetuation of the inequalities is partly the basis of the malfunction of the health systems in Africa today.",

We may start with the three former members of the East African Community, which were supposed to coordinate health strategies and goals\u2014Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda\u2014and their devastating impact, especially on the poor. It will look at the resources and the current structure of their health care systems, beginning with Tanzania. Tanzania, a country of 44 million, is said to follow a pyramidal model or a bottom-up approach, which begins at the village level and reaches the apex at the most advanced, but also most expensive, approach to providing health care. Obviously, if such a system is not well handled, it can ruin the effectiveness and efficiency of the whole health care system and make it inaccessible to the poor, who often constitute the majority. The UN and the World Bank define poverty in the developing world as a person\u2019s condition characterized by an income that is $1.50 or less a day (others say less than $2.00 a day). For the sake of simplification, in this work we use the rate of $2.00/day or less for the poverty level.",

The Village Health Services, built as the first line of defense against ill health and disease, serve the most remote and rural areas of Tanzania, mostly poor and isolated, providing only the most basic preventive primary health care, which can be dispensed even at home. This level of facilities is staffed by two village health workers, who are selected by the village council and briefly trained to respond to villagers\u2019 non-threatening health conditions. The dispensary health services, or the second level, provide more advanced preventive care catered for localities that have a larger population ranging from 6000 to 10,000. The third level of the pyramid, the health center, offers more advanced services to up to 50,000 people, comparable to the population of one administrative division, and are sources of patient referrals to the next level, namely, the district hospital (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare 2013). These health facilities have x-ray equipment and an advanced laboratory component, perform surgery, provide emergency obstetrics care, and admit in-patients and out-patients. However, the major weakness of the health system in Tanzania, as pointed out by knowledgeable analysts, is that it is run by assistant medical doctors (who are nothing but glorified physicians), clinical officers with just two years of training, one clinical officer, and a few registered nurses.",

The resources are simply mishandled and cannot meet the needs of so many people.

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare oversees all hospitals, even though the system has been decentralized, and has several departments that supervise critical programs, some permanent, and some temporary, such as National AIDS Control, Reproductive Child Health, TB and Leprosy, and School Health. Centralization through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has been one of the weaknesses noted by the experts. One expert observes that among other weaknesses, the strategy of primary care is fragmented and the management system is not optimal because of excessive centralization (Yaya and Ileka-Priozeau 2010: 65).",

However, co-payment, the insurance requirement, and the emerging physicians\u2019 private practice have worked to the disadvantage of the poor, children, and pregnant women, who, even though entitled to free treatment, are often required to prove that they are poor. This requirement creates stigma and discourages most non-educated rural populations from seeking assistance. The user fee has been instituted, withdrawn and reinstituted, and, at one point, the government even tried to outsource some of the health service delivery (Brennell and Breannon 2012). One must also note that the user fees get larger as the pyramid reaches the top. Government employees, who account for 6% of the population in Tanzania, must buy a plan with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) at the rate of 6.0% of their income. The informal sector in rural Tanzania may voluntarily pay the premium to the Community Health Fund (CHF), an institution that also insures the indigents and those who are unable to buy insurance, as well as people \u201cless likely to get treatment due to user fees\u201d (Wong 2013).

Health Insurance through the National Insurance Fund (NHIF) is mandated for all salaried Kenyan employees but voluntary membership for those who are self-employed is accepted, just as is the case in Tanzania. Currently, the fees range from 160 to 320 Kenyan shillings or between $2.00 and $4.00. The state\u2019s future plan is to match payment against a person\u2019s salary on a percentage basis. When members and dependents fall ill and are admitted into an accredited hospital, they pay only the balance after a rebate is figured out, which may range from 400 to 2000 Kenyan shillings ($5.00\u2013$22.10) a day. Kenya is seriously moving to a universal insurance coverage based on income, as the constitution of 2012 still maintains that \u201cevery Kenyan has a right to quality and affordable health care, and recognizes the role of the government in removing barriers to access.\u201d",

At the lowest level, the country operates the village health teams or community medicine distributors, who are volunteers, some travelling on a bicycle, and provide basic medical advice to patients and refer them to the appropriate health facilities, unlike in Kenya or Tanzania. The next level is the health center II in each parish, which caters for a few thousands of people and treats such common diseases as malaria and flu, and provides antenatal care. On paper, it is staffed by a nurse and a midwife. These health facilities admit in-patients. The health center III is located in a sub-county and is run by a staff of 18, has a laboratory, and is supervised by a clinical officer. The health center IV is designed to serve a county and has men, women, and children\u2019s wards, admits in-patients, and is run by a senior medical officer, an extra physician, and has an emergency operations theater. The next level is the regional referral hospital. At least 10 of these exist in Uganda and provide all services, including those found at the health center IV, and have specialized clinics and mental health and dentistry facilities, with several consultant physicians. In practice, these often function as \u201cmini-hospitals.\u201d At the top of the Ugandan pyramidal structure are the three national referral and teaching Hospitals (Mulago and Makerere, in Kampala, and Mbarara in Mbarara City, Northwestern Uganda), which have the best physicians, many of whom are in private practice.",

Also, in Uganda, the village level volunteer system is quite unreliable, and the heavy emphasis on a referral system may simply \u201cpass the buck\u201d to the next level; it also suffers from a lack of basic drugs, even for malaria. Furthermore, most ambulant health advisors do not have a bicycle and perform most of their work on foot. A few of the Health Centers II have no laboratories. At times, many do not have water and electricity or possess generators during emergencies. Also, level IV facilities often lack an adequate number of physicians who, at times, must see 100 patients a day, as is the case in Tiriri (Kavuma 2009 Kwesigabo).",

Even though structures for data collection, reporting, and feedback exist at every level of the health care system, their level of functionality is marginal. At the primary health care level, where all data are captured and generated, there is still inadequate capacity of health workers in terms of skills to record accurate data, conduct the analysis, and effectively use the information for decision-making. The system is understaffed and carries a heavy workload. Supportive supervision for districts by MOH and district health teams for primary health facilities is also inadequate due to poor funding save for partners such as PEPFAR, USAID, and CDC, which channel donor funds to the national health care system and improve data quality. Data capturing and reporting is still largely paper-based, and only a few initiatives on electronic health management information system are underway but are donor-driven. What is needed is the strengthening of the capacity of the MOH and the district health systems through skills training, improving staffing, and regularly supporting supervision. Therefore, increasing funding with strict accountability for such health systems and improving activities are not an option but a priority. Along with the problems noted for the three Eastern African countries, the health care system faces many challenges daily, and Tanzania is illustrative of the situation. A 2012 study in Usokami, Tanzania, funded by the European Commission Development Fund and led by Joyce Nyoni, Professor of Social Work at the University of Dar-Es-Salaam, concluded by pointing to other shortcomings, some intangible and others tangible. Nyoni wrote:While there is utilization and acceptability of the use of health services, it was noted that utilization of the health facilities was mainly skewed towards those residing near the health facilities. However, it was also noted that utilization of health services is much lower among the youths irrespective of the distance factor. Two main issues were noted to negatively impact upon contact coverage of health services, namely distance and poverty. In addition to the main factors mentioned were shortage of health staff and drugs and also lack of effective communication between health services providers and the community. (Nyoni 2012: 14)\n",

Muhimbili National Hospital alone, which employs more than 259 physicians, had some 2900 patients awaiting treatment for days. Nurses refused to show for work claiming that they could not do so without the presence of doctors. As a result, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare had to deploy 67 doctors employed at the Ministry headquarters to temporarily replace the striking physicians. At first, former President Jikaya Kikwete told the strikers that they should rather quit their government jobs than strike. However, under pressure, a day later, he promised to raise the salary but only for those who were not involved in the strike\u2014from the monthly salary of $620 (500 British pounds at the current exchange rate) to $727 (600 pounds) in 2012\u20132013. The doctors, however, were asking for an increase of up to $2200 (1,761 pounds), plus allowances and bonuses. During the turmoil, the 1000 member Tanzanian Medical Association alleged that thugs at gun point kidnapped Dr. Steven Ulimboka, their Chairman, drove him to the outskirts of the capital, beat, and tortured him. One doctor claimed that he had treated the Chairman for damage to his finger nails. The President denied the allegations.

The system is slow and unreliable. Use of four wheel vehicles is too expensive in upkeep. Furthermore, even a four wheel vehicle cannot easily travel through the country to help medical facilities\u2019 staff and meet their transportation needs. Thus, in the rural areas, most people have to walk as many as 20 kilometers to get to the next health facility; data collection is poorly done; social and religious barriers (Christianity and Islam) at times prevent the system from functioning smoothly; and out-of-stock medical supplies are also expensive; and certain prescriptions are not available for a long period of time at certain health facilities. The disparities in access to care (and to quality care) are high. Reliance on French hand-outs is also high, and, as a result of the weak health system, Senegal did not achieve the 2015 MDGs. We might mention here that international assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa decreased from $34 per capita in 1990 to $21 in 2001.

Its system has universal health coverage for the Rwandans, with most mutual schemes having adopted a community\u2013based sliding scale of medical costs ranging between 33 US cents and $8. Those insured are expected to contribute up to one-tenth of their financial resources to their medical bills. As of 2014, only 4% of the Rwandans were not insured. Currently, Rwanda\u2019s health system also provides antiretroviral therapy to 80% of those suffering of HIV/AIDS, a rate experts consider to be higher than that of the US, where only 50% enjoy such treatment (April International 2012). For efficiency, the Rwandan health system, at least in theory, claims that it pays salaries to health personnel based on performance only. However, the inherent weakness of the health insurance coverage system lies in that 45% of the operating health costs for universal care come from medical insurance premiums, while all other costs are contingent upon international donations. This is a weakness common to almost all African health care systems. However, to appreciate the reason why the Rwandan health system seems to perform better than others in Africa, one must keep in mind that the task is made a bit easier by the fact that Rwanda is one of the smallest countries in Africa, with a population of only 11 million (2013).",

The health system in Angola relies on the 20% higher per capita income compared to that of the region\u2019s average, even though the poverty level is higher than in most of the neighboring states. Diseases that afflict people are still the tropical type and others, including malaria, trypanosomiasis, recurrent meningitis, yellow fever, yaws, TB, as well as HIV/AIDS, which, however, is estimated at only 2% in prevalence among the general population.

Whatever approach is taken, however, Mozambique must apply some rapid impact strategies that target large segments of the population, using the \u201chealthy settings approach,\u201d which provides some assurance of maximum impact to such places as schools, institutions such as universities, hospitals, cities, villages, and food markets, all based on the premise that \u201chealth depends on supportive healthy settings as a well as good health services\u201d (African Region Health Report\n2013: 96). The health situation in Mozambique has been dramatized and brought to prominence by well-known journalist Ray Suarez, of PBS NewsHour, who traveled to the former Portuguese colony in October 2010, visiting first the district medical center in Chibouti, north of Maputo. Suarez writes: \u201cA cluster of low-slung buildings surrounding a sandy, weedy courtyard, this is the hospital for more than 200,000 Mozambicans. The windows are wide open to the hot, lazy breeze drifting into the pediatric ward\u2026Inside, five to eight beds are full. Women try to calm infants\u2026Some have malaria\u2026Some show the signs of severe malnutrition\u2026Some are HIV-positive\u201d (Suarez 2010: 2). At the Xai-Xai hospital, he writes, \u201cthere is no blasting air-conditioning or endless supply of disposable gowns or medical instruments. What Xai-Xai does is simply take random and sometimes chaotic practices of underfunded hospitals throughout Africa and eliminate them through training, training, and more training.\u201d",

Equatorial Guinea is considered to be a high income country, mainly as a result of the enormous oil reserves being extracted and refined mainly by the Marathon Oil Corporation, making it one of the five major producers of oil in Africa. As expected, the country suffers from the same tropical diseases as others in the region: malaria, TB, measles, yellow fever, leprosy, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, meningitis, and others such as HIV/AIDS. Overall, infectious diseases represent 85% of the consultations in the country, and diarrhea alone accounts for half of the visits, while flu, the major endemic illness, represents 61% of the country\u2019s illnesses. TB\u2019s deadly impact is estimated at 15% among patients on treatment, and most of it is due to late diagnosis and HIV co-infections. About 60% of its population lives in rural areas, with a life expectancy at birth of 52.08 years compared to the average in Sub-Saharan Africa of 55.92\u2014still a major accomplishment for a country located in some of the worst disease-prone areas of the continent. Another major accomplishment of this tiny state is the fact that more than 50% of the population now has access to clean drinking water, when in several parts of Africa the figure does not reach 36%. Also, maternal mortality rate stands at 240 per100,000 live births (2010), compared to the average of 494.53 per 100,000 across Sub-Saharan Africa; the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers stands at 64.6 contrasted to 33.14% in other Sub-Saharan African countries (USAID 2013: 4). The prevalence rate of HIV is 4.7% compared to 7.0% in the Sub-Saharan region. Against malaria, Equatorial Guinea has a relatively higher rate of children sleeping under a bed net in the region, 2.7%, as opposed to 0.7 in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the under-five mortality rate is estimated at 100.3 per 100,000 live births, which is higher when compared to the rest of Sub-Sahara, where, on the average, it is 94.27 per 100,000. Yet, fertility here is extremely high at 5.4 per woman (2011), a little higher than in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, estimated at 5.23 per woman.",

The ministry is responsible for both public health services and direct patient care services. Most health facilities\u2014from large, tertiary referral hospitals (usually situated in large urban areas) to the smallest health clinic or outpost\u2014are part of the public-sector national health system. Most healthcare providers are employed by the government, and work at public health-care facilities where care is generally provide free of charge. However, patients may have to pay fees for diagnostic tests as chest x-rays, laboratory tests, and prescribed medications. In many countries, national policy dictates [on paper and not in reality] that children under age five and pregnant women are exempt from these fees and receive all care free of charge.\n",

On the other hand, if someone is unhealthy, the likelihood is that he will not be able to function properly in society and might spend all his meager resources and energies trying to be well, which might perpetuate his state of poverty or force him to lead an unfulfilling life. Poverty is a consequence of social and political inequalities or disparities that should never be allowed\u2014and can be eradicated just as the disease itself. This is not to deny, of course, that individual behavior may lead one to poverty. However, it is also clear that no one wishes to be poor. Many people are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty since the day they are born, and therefore the risk to their health is high. As the WHO says, \u201cthe poorest almost always experience higher mortality levels, die younger (on average), and experience higher levels of child and maternity mortality,\u201d because \u201ccausality between poverty and ill health is bi-directional, demonstrated in both macro-level (cross-national and national) and micro-level (individual, household, and community) studies\u201d (Quoted from World Bank 2004: 3).",

One flight from Sierra Leone to Nigeria carrying an infected passenger may have contributed to the virus appearing across borders for the first time in the many years of its existence in an isolated area to a country, such as Nigeria, where it had never been seen before. Ebola, for which no effective cure has been found and kills as many as 60% of its victims, is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where it erupted first in 1976. Thereafter, it slowly and intermittently spread to surrounding countries, and by July 2014, it had reached Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria. On July 28, 2014, an American working in Liberia took a flight to Nigeria and collapsed after landing at Lagos. He was taken to the hospital for testing and treatment, but he died immediately, and Ebola was diagnosed as the cause of his death. Preventive measures, such as closely monitoring the borders were put in place, flights to and from certain countries cancelled, and schools and markets closed. Speculations are that the disease is transmitted from non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, to man. Its symptoms include muscle aches, headaches, fevers, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rashes, red eyes, and breathing and swallowing difficulties, and leads to profuse internal bleeding, which may appear in body orifices, such as the nose, eye, and rectum, and is contracted from person to person through body fluids. Its incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, but some had suspected that the infection might spread even in the pre-active phase of the disease.

Both Ebola and Marburg are hemorrhagic fevers and both are deadly, but they react differently to antibodies. Interestingly, this German connection is never mentioned when the origins of the disease are discussed. The most vulnerable to the disease are relatives of the infected persons and health workers, including doctors and nurses, some of whom lost their lives trying to save the sick. Funerals for the infected dead have proven to be also one of the sources of contagion, as people refuse to abandon traditional practices that allow the living to touch the dead or wash them without proper protective gear.

His address reiterates what constitutes poverty and how poverty impacts health. David Lawson also notes that, in Southern Africa, poverty is no longer focused on income differences and key indicators, such as morbidity, mortality, and nutrition. Since 1984, he adds, the focus has been on a \u201cmultidimensional and people centered understanding of poverty and welfare,\u201d encouraging researchers and policy-makers to focus on the individual, which takes into consideration his or her capabilities to function normally as expected by society. In his analysis, Lawson almost equates poverty itself to a disease, as he writes: From such perspectives, preventable deaths and ill-health are not merely outcomes of poverty but integral components of poverty itself, measuring simultaneously the NDP\u2019s human development index (HDI) and human poverty index (HIP) that incorporate health indicators in their compilation (Lawson 2004: 2).\n",

Experience and interdisciplinary studies have shown that \u201cthe poorest, around the world, have the worst health. Within countries, the evidence shows that, in general, the lower an individual\u2019s socioeconomic position, the worse their health. There is a gradient in health that runs from top to bottom the socioeconomic spectrum\u2026This is a global phenomenon seen in low, middle and high income countries\u201d (The WHO Report\n2011: 200). It is also a fact that poverty is often a generational phenomenon from which many individuals cannot extricate themselves. As the UN again reveals, \u201cThe multi-generational nature of poverty, with successive generations inheriting the disadvantages of their predecessors, means that over the years poverty and deprivation have become part of the characterization of particular racial and ethnic groups trapped in poverty\u201d (Social Watch\n2013: 1\u20134). Incidentally, as the UN finally notes, \u201cit takes 1% of the global income to eradicate all poverty in the world in a year, equivalent to 0.5% of the annual world income, to provide universal access to basic social services (basic education, health, nutrition, and access to water and sewage disposal)\u201d (WHO Regional Office Africa\n2011). Sadly, as of 2011, 33 of the 49 poorest countries in the world are in Africa, and, in 1985, Africa represented 16% of the world\u2019s poor. This number grew to 31% by 1998, and, in 2011, the WHO noted, \u201cthe trend is likely to continue, with poverty expected to decline over the next 20 years in every part of the world, except Sub-Saharan Africa, where a dramatic increase is expected,\u201d HIV/AIDS playing a major role in this process (WHO Regional Office Africa\n2011: 3).",

Second, the growing consensus in Africa about the right to health through universal insurance has been strengthened by a positive response from the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. UN agencies working for \u201cSustainable Development for Post-2015\u201d\u2014following achievement of the MDGs\u2014support the principle that all health benefits must be enjoyed by all on equal terms \u201cwhile making financial contributions according to their ability to pay: UHC means that healthy, wealthy people must subsidize services for the sick and the poor\u201d (see Yates 2013). This consensus is a result of continued failure of private voluntary insurances and community-based schemes over the past several decades. Relying on solid studies, OXFAM stresses the point that social health insurance as a percentage of a person\u2019s income and general taxation are the best models to ensure that the health of all citizens is equally protected. To this WHO adds: \u201cAny insurance scheme must be judged on impact on the entire population\u201d and not just on the rich, which implies the need for a \u201ccompulsory public system and use of financial taxation to cover informal sectors,\u201d as is already been done in South Africa and Rwanda, both of which are moving toward universal insurance coverage.",

However, experts fear that this will most likely create a two-tier provision of care \u201cthat will benefit some but harm the concept of equal access to quality care for all citizens\u201d (Economist Intelligence\n2011: 14). Some estimate that, by 2020, private spending from employers, not-for-profit organizations insurance corporations, and non-governmental institutions will reach $28 billion, about 17% of the total health care expenditures in Africa. Optimists believe that more than half of Sub-Saharan Africa or 70% of the African Region (excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Eritrea, Sudan, and Somalia)\u2014if the economic conditions continue to improve at the pace seen over the past five years and the leadership changes for the better\u2014might be able to commit a minimum of $60 per capita health spending by the majority of the Sub-Saharan African countries. In Tanzania, as briefly noted earlier, the NHIF covers civil servants, who are 6% of the population, at a rate of 6% of their income (Azevedo et al. 2014).

The scheme sounds cheap but not for someone who makes no more than $10 a month. In this setting, people have to choose between health and nutrition and other important necessities of life.

This odd requirement has contributed to further stigma, thus defeating the purpose of the legislation. Furthermore, the assessed fee gets higher as the health pyramid system reaches the apex, the referral national hospitals. The claim of free services is, however, deceiving. For example, when mothers or children are seen by the doctor freely, syringes, drugs, gowns, and other essential components are the responsibility of the patients. Often, when they might have the funds, they are unable to purchase the medication prescribed by the doctor because the pharmacy may be either out-of-stock of the items or the prices specifically recommended to the pharmacy by the doctor or the government are too expensive.

According to Farmer, SAPs are barriers preventing individuals from exercising their rights such as the right to education and health, especially when \u201cthe individual is not at fault; rather, social forces, historical processes, and their resulting legacies constrain the individual.\u201d Then, he adds: \u201cStructural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress\u201d (Farmer 2001). In Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland, for example, life expectancy at birth was reduced to 35 years, during the 1980\u20131990 period, the worst years of the health crisis in Africa\u2014according to UNAIDS\u2014as a result of structural adjustments and the HIV/AIDS epidemics. During that time, Africa also lost 544 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 people, more than twice the loss in India, due to disability, death, or ill health. In 1992, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Ghana accepted the structural adjustment or conditionalities from the IMF and imposed user fees (also known as co-payments, co-financing, and cost-recovery). As a result, government subsidies to health in Zimbabwe decreased by 14% between 1990 and 1992, and then by 29% during 1992 and 1993. The health budget decreased by 50% hitting pre-natal and delivery health care the hardest. In Kenya, external patients\u2019 consultations decreased by 40%, especially affecting treatment of those suffering from sexually transmitted diseases. Ghana did not do as bad, and became the model for the adjustment programs. Some studies show that the standard of living in Africa fell by 2 per year between 1990 and 2008, to a level lower than it was in the early 1960s and 1970s.

While roads were built on the European model, linking primarily productive centers, they neglected the countryside. Obviously, they did not take into account that most Africans were pedestrians, and that humans and cows, for example, constantly crisscrossed them at the same time. The 1978 enthusiasm for Alma-Ata, which was supposed to build enduring infrastructures to ensure health for all by 2000, began to dissipate during the 1990s; the health workforce began to be slashed, as was the case in Senegal, where it decreased from 5,904 in 1989 to 4,886 in 1995; and budgets were cut in almost all of Africa, reaching lower levels than was the case during the 1960s and 1970s.",

Globalization, a term coined in the 1970s, is a buzzword today but the controversy over its impact on the developing world continues to rage both among the rich and the educated and among the poor and the vulnerable populations of the globe. The very definition of the term is controversial, and it often depends on the ideology of the definer from one end of the spectrum to that of the receiver. Listening to one of the most known experts in the concept of globalization, Labonte, might help the reader understand the pertinent issues. Labonte (2011) says: \u201cGlobalization, defined at its simplest, describes the constellation of processes by which nations, business and people are becoming more connected and interdependent across the globe through increased economic and communication exchange, culture diffusion (especially Western) and travel.\u201d This definition already connotes a one-sided direction of the movement, as it stresses the influence of Western \u201ccivilization\u201d and culture over the developing, non-Western world. Labonte amplifies his point by stressing the importance of a free flow of capital, goods and services which, according to some, should lead to global equality and liberty, and the spread of new ideas and technologies. These would, in turn, spur global economic growth. The benefits of the process would trickle down to the poor and the rich simultaneously.",

Besada notes that:Globalization also has had far-reaching implications for health systems in Africa. By intensifying the economic and racial interconnectivity between countries, it has provided more employment opportunities for health care workers and greater integration of health care services, exchange of medical information, transfer of skills, information medical products and standards of practices as well as resources and avenues for responding to challenges in the health sector.

A study conducted by Behrman et al. in 2000 in 18 Latin American countries affected by globalization found great imbalances in the distribution of incomes that resulted in higher inequalities in 13 cases. The worse result was attributed to the liberalization of international finance followed by domestic financial liberalization and tax reform adopted to attract foreign investments. The study also found that outsourcing, practiced by the major corporations, weakens \u201ccollective bargaining, minimum wages, and safety at work\u201d (WHO 2011). Even the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been linked to globalization and its unintended results. Kunitz views HIV/AIDS as \u201ca product of contemporary globalization [and] the precursor of the epidemic,\u201d because this disease, he argues, \u201cerupted simultaneously with, and was exacerbated by, the economic crisis that engulfed many poor countries, especially in Africa in the 1980s. That crisis had measurable demographic effects beyond those attributed to HIV and AIDS, and though they were not AIDS-related, they prepared fertile ground in which disease could take root\u201d (Kunitz 2007: 181). In their volume titled Medicine, Mobility, and Power in Global Africa, editors Hansjorg Dilger, Abdoulaye Kane, and Stacey A. Lamgwick have a unique and interesting perspective on globalization. So far, most scholars have looked at it as a one-way street, benefiting only the West and those with power, what they have called \u201cpush and pull factors.\u201d",

In their view, the new migratory flow is contributing to the amalgamation of new global consumers, syncretic medicines, new treatments, new clinics, new entrepreneurs in the health business, new and transformed healers, and the use of new specialized medical services such as in vitro fertilization. Thus, many healing practices in Africa are being transported to the new national and international domiciles by migrants and health professionals, who, even though abroad, continue to be fed health-wise by the traditional medical practices they were accustomed to, bringing, in the process, new clients, and new curious practitioners. These transformations are the result of the flow of migration and impact of new \u201cideas, goods, images, flows of money, and people between poor(er) and rich(er) countries,\u201d brought about by globalization. In this process, Africans bring with them, without regard to borders, their cache of immemorially sanctioned medical practices in the form of \u201cherbs, pills, blessed waters, prayers, audiocassettes of holy scripture recitations\u201d (Dilger et al. 2012), say the authors.",

Even though this is a refreshing look at Africa\u2019s participation in the globalization movement that includes health and medicine, it leaves many questions unanswered. Who, for example, is the primary agent of the movement? Is the migration of health professionals to African countries, such as South Africa, or to the Western world? What is the level of the syncretic nature of new treatments, if not that which affects only the migrants primarily, as they continue the practices they brought with them? Who is able to compete meaningfully in the new order? Who comes up with inventions, and the initiatives for technological change? Is it driven by the migrants or the nationals of the new domicile in the Diaspora? How do herbalists, for instance, influence the international or global community? If Africa is not the place of gaps and marginalization, is poverty increased or decreased by the migratory flow? Does it help a man in the village to own a cell phone and an impressive shiny Mercedes Benz when he cannot find housing and a place to sleep, cannot feed his family, cannot have nutritious food, is unable to go to school, does not have clean water, and still continues to defecate in the woods for lack of latrines? In essence, how has thus far globalization alleviated the plight of those Africans who live in misery and are vulnerable to all types of infectious and non-communicable diseases? Where is, in the process, the right of people to health, and how is it permanently guaranteed?",

The word \u2018sanitation\u2019 [the definition continues] also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal\u201d (WHO 2014a, b). Hygiene is a broader word which The Dictionary defines as \u201cany practice or activity that you do to keep things healthy and clean.

The way the British themselves described the health facilities in Kenya and Uganda is elucidating:Some were appalling, notably the Native Civil Hospital in Nairobi, established for the workers who built the Uganda Railway, condemned in 1904, but not replaced until 1922 owing to dispute over where to locate the town\u2019s African quarter.

The health facilities are also a problem, as 38% of them do not have water, do not have hygienic practices, and where sanitary conditions are extremely poor. Thus, in 2013, the WHO adds, 289,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth, even though the mortality rates have decreased by 50% between 1994 and 2014 (Mis, Rueters\n2014: 1).",

First, may be the topography: lack of rivers and lakes, dry areas, and colonial legacy, which concentrated its attention on the cities where the white colonial population lived, modeled after the European towns of the time. These were inherited by the African elite, forming enclaves of improved sanitation and sewage disposal. Thus, the difference between town and country is 37% for the former and 17% for the latter (Yaya 2010: 98). Another is lack of better organization and the selection of the best department for water and sanitation. Virtually each African state has its own allocation of this responsibility, from the Department of Public Works as during the colonial period to the Ministry of Transportation, Mines, and Telecommunications (in Cameroon), the Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing and Ministry of Water, and Ministry of Public Health (in Chad), the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Ministry of Public Works (in Liberia) (See Yaya 2010: 106\u2013107). Wars have been devastating in that they have not only killed people but also destroyed health, sanitation, and water infrastructures, as has been the case in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, where 70% of its health infrastructure has been destroyed by the civil war. Poor data availability has also been named one of the major obstacles, as no rational decisions can be made without assessment of needs, and the recorded actual conditions on the ground, and fair or equitable distribution of resources and infrastructure projects.",

The problem with the schemes being experimented with in Africa today\u2014which combine or single out public, private, commercial, philanthropic, traditional, and informal health insurance providers\u2014is that they are ineffective and confusing. This causes problems to the ability of the health sector to fulfill the health needs of the insured and non-insured citizens, ending up by shortchanging the poor, the vulnerable, and those who are the least influential members of society. This occurs in a poorly conceived health system that cannot cover or expand its resources to ensure the availability of and access to most health services, such as immunization, adequate birth attendance, and maternal and child morbidity and mortality prevention programs. It has been demonstrated that \u201cneonates represent about 40% of children who die before their fifth birthday and that 20% neonatal deaths globally occur in Africa. The African Region\u2019s neonatal mortality is the highest in the world\u201d (WHO African Region Health Report\n2013: 19). In sum, Africans need to conceive and implement effective and efficient national health models that protect the health of all its citizens, especially mothers and children. It is clear, however, that countries\u2019 presidents and heads of state, government ministers, health ministry secretaries, and most high level civil servants have no problem covering the health costs. Why is this so? Who foots their bill, and where do the resources come from? The answer is self-evident. Obviously, all these problems are exacerbated by the high levels of poverty that plague the whole continent of Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of the nature of the colonial system experienced, and notwithstanding the available resources that could cut by half the index of people\u2019s misery.",

It is in this arena and in that of maternal and child care that the continent has the chance to turn things around for the better. Thus, despite all the natural environmental and social obstacles, Africa can do better. Understanding this does not require a rocket scientist or a Ph.D. in environmental studies: It requires only common sense and sensitivity to the lives of people that have been entrusted to us. Put differently, the intolerable state of hygiene and lack of awareness of its importance for the prevention of disease rests solely on the shoulders of the leaders, given that, in most cases, the resources for providing the basic means to at least 90% of the citizens, including those living in the villages, are there. The same remarks can be made of the sewage systems in Africa and the waste that is found undisposed of in many towns and cities. However, for the change to happen, leaders must be reminded constantly of the awful conditions under which people live and realize the number of lives the lack of sanitation and hygiene ruins. Likewise, one does not need to have a degree in public health and economics to understand that, financially, prevention is always better in the long-run than trying to take action when epidemics, such as cholera or meningitis, hit a population. Over 144 studies conducted during the 1990s and earlier revealed that, if water supplies and sanitary conditions are sufficiently improved, diarrheal mortality would be reduced by 50 to 80%\u2014of course, \u201cdepending on the types of intervention and the presence of risk factors such as poor feeding practices and maternal literacy\u201d (WB, Better Health\n1994: 31).",

However, this must be done with extreme sensitivity, as is the case of trying to eliminate defecation in open air, which involves issues of privacy, stigma, important cultural norms, and the concept of human dignity (Patkan and Goshing 2014: 42). One example might perhaps serve as inspiration for many African countries. To improve sanitation and hygiene, immediately after Zimbabwe became independent, the leaders created the Ministry of Rural Resources and Water Development, allocating some Z$1.3 billion in 1997\u20131998, which became an important sign and symbol that the leaders saw the importance of programs designed to improve the lives of people who did not live in the cities and towns. This made a major difference in the lives of the Zimbabweans across the country. Unfortunately, as a result of civil unrest and unwise economic and social policies, Zimbabwe\u2019s health system has virtually collapsed and people\u2019s living standards deteriorate by the day.",

Changing habits, as we know, is always difficult and even painful, especially if they are firmly engrained in a culture\u2014one reason why many heads of households sometimes refuse to use a commode or a latrine even when available. It is good to remember that, in most of Africa, a father-in-law, for example, would not leave his bodily waste in the same spot as his son-in-law and would feel uncomfortable, as well, to live in a house whose dining area and a latrine are built side by side, even if separated by a wall. It appears that, as a result of the pledges to reach the MDGs by 2015, African countries are becoming more and more aware of the need for a sound waste management system and water improvement. In addition, international agencies are contributing both to awareness and to the actual provision of systems that are helping Africa come out of its long history of neglect of the health aspect of the issue at hand. Sanitation neglect has made Africa the worse continent on water improvement and provision of a clean environment that is conducive to health, longevity, and proper disposal of human, industrial, and animal waste.",

Even though it is a cop out to blame colonialism for the health ills of the continent today, its legacy cannot and should not be ignored, though many analysts tend to develop amnesia about most that befell Africans for over a century. The impact of the ghost of colonialism, as discussed in this volume, is clearly reflected in the colonial health models that are still being followed in Africa\u2019s medical, academic, and professional schools, including legal training and constitutional frameworks. Colonial health models have failed to examine and take into account all factors and root causes that led to unending epidemics and the impact of famines and thinking patterns that continue to curse Africa. Even when discussing the HIV/AIDS pandemic that hit Africa harder than any other continent at the beginning of the 1980s, researchers and health practitioners, both African and non-African, were nothing but pseudo-experts and scientists who, imbued of a colonial mentality, were quick to point the finger at Africa\u2019s promiscuity as a major reason for its spread on the continent and failed to examine some of the historical roots of the crisis, which included: the plundering of the African productive lands for over 100 years, thus causing numerous famines particularly during the 1880s\u20131920s, rendering Africans\u2019 immune system weaker; the migratory movement caused by colonially forced dislocation; the rapid changes that impacted sexual mores; poverty that made women and children more vulnerable to predatory men of money and power; deterioration of the state of hygiene, a condition that can easily help spread infectious diseases; the increased level of prostitution to satisfy the lust of international travelers; and the legacy of armed colonial men that fought wars in Africa and abroad in World War I and World War II, all of which enhanced the spread of sexually transmitted venereal diseases. As a result, the long presence of a higher number of venereal diseases and other infections was responsible for the quick spread of HIV/AIDS, as shown by experts such as Kunitz, who wrote:The colonial legacy must bear some responsibility for the conditions that made Africa vulnerable to this deadly disease, that is, HIV/AIDS. Indeed, while colonialism interfered with agricultural productivity, globalization, the economics of scale and contentious, ethnic-preferential, and rigged politics contributed directly and indirectly to malnutrition and skewed distribution of resources that left many Africans at the margin of society in their own continent.\n",

            "text": "The forced risks and practices imposed on Africans prior to and following independence could only bring misery and famine to vulnerable populations, especially when the weather conditions brought drought or flooding, which constitute favorable breeding grounds for locusts, rodents, mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and hookworms. This burden not only contributed to ill health but also compromised the immune system, \u201cpoverty, and undernourishment [and malnourishment], which facilitated recurrent epidemics of measles and whooping cough and other diseases right up to 1945. The epidemics resulted in high infant mortality,\u201d as was the case with the 1918\u20131919 influenza epidemic, which the Nyamwezi jokingly called \u201cbom bom because the explosive cough reminded them of the noise of the cannon\u201d (Ranger 1992: 262). What explains the fact that, while measles has virtually been eradicated throughout the world, Africa stills experiences many local epidemics? Indeed, while from 2000 to 2001, the number of deaths from measles worldwide was reduced from 542,000 to 158,000, respectively (Medecins Sans Frontieres 2014), the dead toll continued to plague the continent of Africa. In sum, to understand the state of health in Africa today requires a careful and comprehensive analysis of all risks, past and present, to which the continent has been subjected, including a highly erratic and selfish type of leadership, quite often imposed on the Africans and supported by the West, as has been the case in Chad, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea.",
