Barely 20 years ago, we had not imagined the technological advancements, which are now implemented into our lives. Technological advancement, riding on the wave of disruptive technologies of the last quarter of a century, is reshaping and redefining the world\u2019s social order and norms. The medical field is part and parcel of our lives and is perhaps one that we care the most about. In the recent times, this field has undergone vast changes. The medical profession today has evolved greatly since the beginning of this century. Not only the medical procedures, the medical data flow and management has also undergone considerable improvement. Advance data transfer and management techniques have made improvements in disease diagnostic and have been a critical role in national health planning and efficient record keeping. In particular, the medical profession has undergone substantial changes through the capabilities of database management, which has given rise to the Healthcare Information Systems (HIS). Medical data collected from different institutions can now be mined and analysed in time using Big Data Analytics tools.",

An example of such a practice can be found in [2]. Advantages of such consultations lies in the fact that the symptoms presented online by the patients are matched with those of about ten thousand known diseases [3], whereas doctors can only match the symptoms against a fraction of the known diseases which they are familiar without the intervention of an IT database. Likewise virtual nursing to support patients online is also available from [4]. Yet another app [5] developed by Boston Children Hospital provides basic health information and advice for parents of ill children.",

Their use in fields like nuclear arsenal, production of automobiles, and manipulations in space has been widespread. In comparison, the medical science field has somewhat been gradual to take advantage of this technology. Nevertheless, robots are now days being utilised to assist in or perform many complex medical procedures, which has given rise to the term Robotic Surgery. A comprehensive discussion of robotic surgery is available in [6]. Indeed there are many advantages of using robots in healthcare management. For example, developing pharmaceuticals through clinical trials can take many years and cost may rise to billions of dollars. Making this process faster and more affordable could change the world. Robots can play a critical role in such trials. Robots are also very effective in medico training where simulations are achieved.",

The conventional laparoscopy, the surgeon would have limited degree of freedom with a 2D vision, whereas the robotic system would provide a 3D view with intuitive motion and enable additional degrees of freedom.

To keep the environment free of these viruses and bacteria, the environments needs to be cleaned efficiently and regularly. However some viruses like Ebola [2] and MERs Coronavirus [12] are highly contagious and cannot be cleaned by humans without having protective gear, which can be costly and may or may not be effective. Cleaning the hospital with chlorine is an effective way. However, there are many drawbacks of this method including a high risk for cleaners to be infected themselves. A sophisticated approach was implemented in US hospitals by using robots [13] to purify the space. However, some of the robots used are not motorized and may require a human to place them in the infected room or area, posing the risk of infection to humans. It is not known as to which substance or matter can effectively eliminate deadly viruses like Ebola and MERs Coronavirus. However, according to [14], beta-Coronaviruses, which is one of the four strands of MERs Coronavirus, can be effectively eliminated by UV light. For such a deadly and highly contagious virus clearing, a robot that can be remote controlled is needed, which can move forward, backward and sideways, and is able to clean itself.",

The healthcare industry a bit slow to take the advantage of the technology. Earlier, medical records and systems were paper based. Thus the first phase of the usage of information technology and systems in hospital and healthcare management was to transform paper based records to database systems. Not only did it change paper based systems to electronic ones but also allowed data manipulation. As a result, more data could be processed in a very short time, which was critical in making timely decisions. A discussion of early stages of this transformation can be found in [22]. Consolidation of this technology resulted in Healthcare Management Information Systems (HMIS). Timely decision is critical in all walks of life but it assumes a much greater urgency in some healthcare cases. HMIS is capable to transferring data from one location or application to another within split of a second, as opposed to days without the help of electronic systems. This allows users to access, use and manipulate data instantly and concurrently. As the technology continues to evolve and refine, the performance of information systems operations, in particular those of HMIS, is bound to improve.",

            "text": "Medical data is also growing at a rapid rate in many hospitals, clinics and insurance companies. Mining and analysis of healthcare data is even more critical as it relates to the wellbeing of the society. Data centric research is highly desirable to find answers to questions on many chronical diseases, and to plan and manage national and international health programs. Potential befits of big data analytics in healthcare are discussed in [32]. In particular, authors have provided five strategies for success with big data. These are (1) implementing big data governance, (2) developing an information sharing culture, (3) training key personnel to use big data analytics, (4) incorporating cloud computing into the organization\u2019s big data analytics, and (5) generating new business ideas from big data analytics. A survey of big data analytics in healthcare and government is conducted in [33], where the need for the analytics is linked to the provision and improvement of patient centric services, detection of diseases before they spread, monitoring the quality of services in hospitals, improving methods of treatment, and provision of quality medical education. Authors in [34] identify medical signals as a major source of big data, discuss analytical techniques of such data. Some of the well known tools used for big data analytics areApache\u2122 Hadoop\u00ae is highly scalable storage platform. It provides cost-effective storage solution for large data volumes. It doesn\u2019t require any particular format.Apache Spark is an open source, in-memory processing machine. Its performance is much faster than that of Hadoop.MapReduce is used for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining.\n",

With medical data these concerns assumes higher pronounce and priority. Medical data can be very sensitive, and may be linked to life and death of the patients. Often socio political issues are linked with medical data. It is well known that India was divided into two countries giving rise to Pakistan in 1947. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, very clever and shrewd, was the leader of Pakistan campaign, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre [35] argue that the partition of India could have been avoided if \u201cthe most closely guarded secret in India\u201d had become known. Jinnah was suffering from tuberculosis which was slowly but surely killing him. In [28, 36, 37], privacy issues of data are discussed.",
