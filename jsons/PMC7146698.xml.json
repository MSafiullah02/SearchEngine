By early April, only four countries had received support from either instrument, and the IMF's principal response has been more of the same: urging crisis-stricken countries to apply for conventional loans, albeit with greater flexibility in funding\u2014up to $1 trillion is reportedly available. These loans are subject to controversial conditionalities\u2014reforms that must be introduced before money is disbursed. Such conditionalities have adverse effects on population health because they include ill-designed policy measures such as budget cuts, reducing the number and wages of health and social workers, weakening workforce protections, or promoting privatisations.3\n",

First, the $2 billion that the International Finance Corporation will disburse via its Real Sector Crisis Response Facility envisages, among others, loans to private companies in the health-care sector.
