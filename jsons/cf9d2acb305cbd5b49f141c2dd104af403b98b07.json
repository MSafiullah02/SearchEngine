As such, asthma therapy delivered by a metered dose inhaler would be more appropriate in the health care setting. 3 Nevertheless, some patients are so tight that using a metered dose inhaler, even with a spacer, might be problematic, particularly if they have uncontrolled coughing, have severe life-threatening asthma, or are uncooperative or unable to follow the directions required for a metered dose inhaler with a spacer.",
