After washed 3 times with PBST, samples (100\u03bcL/well) were added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The IgY (1 mg/mL) was 2-fold serial diluted in PBS (pH7.4, 0.01 M). The IgY from non-immunized hens was used as a negative control. The plate was washed 3 times again and 100\u03bcL/well of HRP affiliate rabbit anti-chicken IgY (Promega, USA; 1:5000) was added and the plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After being washed 3 times, 100 \u03bcL of TMB substrate solution (Huamei biological engineering co., Ltd.) was added to each well for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. After that, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcL of 2 M H2SO4 to each well. The optical densities of the wells were determined at 405 nm with a plate reader (Bio-Rad, USA). When ODsample/ODnegative > 2.1 and ODnegative > 0.1, the maximum dilution multiple of the sample was determined as the IgY titer.",

One of the studies evaluated in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of IgY against C. albicans by using proteins from sonicated cells of C. albicans as antigen to immunized hens. In the study, anti- C. albicans IgY significantly reduced the adherence capacity of C. albicans to human pharynx carcinoma cells. Oral administration of anti- C. albicans IgY by mice significantly reduced the number of C. albicans and the scores of tongue lesions; anti- C. albicans IgY also reduced colonization of C. albicans in mouse organs, indicating that anti- C. albicans IgY had a protective effect against the oral candidiasis of experimentally infected mice and reduced the dissemination of C. albicans [26].",

We immunized the hens with cell wall proteins extracted from T. rubrum. The cell wall was considered to be the major part of the deposition of fungal immune response products. Many studies have shown that cell wall proteins have good immunogenicity and can induce specific antibodies [[28], [29], [30]]. In our study, the cell wall proteins showed good immunogenicity, highest titer of anti-trCWP IgY reaching 1:16000. The anti-trCWP IgY expressed significant inhibitory effect on T. rubrum in a dose-dependent manner compared with IgY from unimmunized hens,and significantly reduced lesion scores of mice experimentally infected with T. rubrum. Moreover, the anti-trCWP IgY reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, epithelium damage and hyperplastic tissue of cuticle.",

The cell wall provides both adhesive properties critical for the invasion of host tissue and protection against the host defense mechanisms [31]. The first step of dermatophytes to infect the host is to inoculate the germinating fungus into the skin, which adheres to the cuticle. The occlusion and impregnation of the cuticle accelerate the adhesion process. The fungal spores sprout after being adhered to the cuticle for a long time; the mycelia continue to spread, especially in the lower layer of the cuticle [32]. Anti-trCWP IgY may be directly bound to the proteins on the fungal cell wall, inhibit the proliferation of T. rubrum, reduce the adherence capacity of T. rubrum to host cells and prevent further invasion of the fungal hypha to the host.",
