In a system with cointegrating rank r, Pesaran and Shin (2001) show that exact identification requires r restrictions in each of the r cointegrating vectors. The popular Johansen, 1988, Johansen, 1991, Johansen, 1995 method uses a statistical approach to achieve the needed restrictions. Pesaran and Shin (2001) and Pesaran and Smith (1998) criticize this approach as a pure mathematical convenience, and instead advocate a theory-based approach. Hall, Henry, and Greenslade (2002) argue that the different identification methods proposed in the literature are almost impossible to implement in practice, due to the limited sample sizes typically available for empirical research. As an alternative, they suggest testing and imposing theory-based weak exogeneity assumptions at the earliest stage of the model reduction process. In this paper, we apply the Hall et al. (2002) strategy to the problem of estimating a structural econometric model of Hawaii tourism, where both demand and supply-side influences may be important.",

Nearly all existing studies focus solely on the demand side of the market, attempting to model either the demand arising from alternative source-country markets for a particular tourism destination, or the allocation of outbound travel demand to alternative destinations. 4\nThe application of cointegration analysis and the associated error-correction dynamic specifications to tourism demand modeling began in the mid-1990s, and is now relatively common. In many cases, single-equation methods have been used with little or no consideration of potential endogeneity problems (see for example Gonzalez and Moral, 1995, Kim and Song, 1998, Song et al., 2000, Vogt and Wittayakorn, 1998).

Hawaii is a particularly apt case for such analysis, because tourists from two markets\u2013the United States and Japan\u2013represent a dominant 85% of the total market. Clearly, in this case demand parameters cannot be estimated reliably without regard to supply constraints and potential price responses. And of course, a knowledge of supply-side behavior is of interest in its own right. Our identified model describes relatively long-run equilibrium relationships governing tourism demand and visitor accommodations pricing in Hawaii, and the forecasts compare favorably with those of three competing models according to the Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests of forecast accuracy.",

Formally, the Marshallian demand for the tourism product can be expressed as, (1)Dij=F(Yi,Pi,Pj,PjS,Z), where Dij is the tourism product demanded in destination j by consumers from origin country i; Yi is the income of origin country i; Pi is the price of other goods and services in the origin country i; Pj is the price of the tourism product in destination country j; PjS is the price of tourism product in competing destinations; and Z is the vector of other factors affecting tourism demand.

Exchange rate adjusted relative prices (real exchange rates) are commonly used as proxies for both effects. 8\nFinally, transportation costs are sometimes included as a separate factor in determining travel. 9\nMany studies augment income and price variables with deterministic effects: time trends to capture evolving consumer tastes; a constant term to account for \u201cutility image\u201d that does not vary greatly with time; dummies to account for various one-off events such as the Olympic Games, large-scale fairs, foreign currency/travel restrictions and oil crises; seasonality; or changes in data collection methods. These types of events, if otherwise neglected, might lead to bias in the estimated parameters (Anastasopoulos, 1984, Crouch et al., 1992, Kliman, 1981, Mak et al., 1977).",

Tourists from these two markets consistently account for over 85% of all visitors. To keep the model size manageable, we do not include visitors from other destinations. For the same reason, we include only the principle determinants of tourism demand, leaving out influences that are deemed less central to our analysis. In addition, some conceptually relevant factors are excluded because of the difficulty of finding appropriate proxies. The model includes five demand determinants: US real personal income (yr_us), US consumer price index (cpi_us), Japanese real personal income (yr_jp), Japanese exchange rate adjusted CPI (cpi_E_jp) and Hawaii average daily hotel room price (prm).

As a result, in the short run there is a considerable incentive for the hotelier to fill an empty room by discounting the price to almost as low as the negligible marginal cost of filling a room, leading to price incentives during off-peak periods. 13\nOver longer horizons, capacity is adjusted through expansion and contraction of room inventory.",

The parameter on arrivals is a measure of the (inverse) long-run supply elasticity of lodging services. In the short term, the markup over the marginal cost should be sensitive to excess demand/supply conditions, as suggested above. We include the occupancy rate (ocup) as a proxy for these influences. It would be desirable to include Hawaii-specific input cost measures, but other than local wage rates, such measures do not exist.

F-tests for this null hypothesis are presented in Panel 2 of Table 2.

All equations perform reasonably well, explaining 51%, 62%, 46%, and 65% of the variation in \u0394vus, \u0394vjp, \u0394prm, and \u0394ocup, respectively. All equations pass all diagnostic tests at the 5% significance level. The existence of long-run equilibrium error terms in the model equations allows for a temporary disequilibrium between causal variables and the demand and supply variables. The adjustment factors (\u03b1s) capture the speed of adjustment toward the equilibrium relationship. For example, if US arrivals are less than predicted by US real income growth and the relative cost of a Hawaii vacation, arrivals would increase over time to eliminate the disequilibrium error. The three long-run equilibrium errors enter the four equations differently. The equation for US visitor growth, \u0394vus, contains both \u03beDus and \u03beS. The loading parameter on the US demand equilibrium error, \u03beDus, is \u22120.11, so 11% of the equilibrium error is corrected each period. In the equation for Japanese visitor growth, \u0394vjp, the equilibrium error associated with Japanese visitor demand, \u03beDjp, enters with a coefficient of \u22120.34, implying a complete adjustment towards equilibrium in slightly less than three quarters. The equilibrium errors for US demand, \u03beDus, and the pricing rule, \u03beS, enter the hotel room price equation, \u0394prm, while all three errors enter the equation for the change in hotel occupancy, \u0394ocup. In the case of the Japanese visitor demand equation, the equilibrium error for the pricing rule, \u03beS, is retained, despite the fact that its t-value (\u22121.57) is below the 5% critical value. The same is true for the US demand equilibrium error in the occupancy rate equation. In both cases excluding these equilibrium errors led to a rejection of the null hypothesis of no serial correlation (up to lag 5) in the equation residuals.

The DLVARX in differences precludes the possibility of cointegration, but has the advantage of converting some forms of structural change into one period shocks. In both cases, the rival models are identified (one equation at a time) using the model selection algorithm in PcGETS 10.3 (Hendry & Krolzig, 2001). 26\nSpecifically, we construct a Generalized Unrestricted Model (GUM) in log levels (or differences) for each endogenous variable in the HTM just-identified system. That is, each endogenous variable is explained by up to four lags (three in the differenced model) of each of the four endogenous and four weakly exogenous variables, and we make use of the theory-motivated exclusion restrictions used in the just-identified model presented in Table 4. 27\nPcGETS is used in its default \u201cliberal-testimation\u201d mode.

The HTM produces forecasts with MSEs that are statistically smaller than those of the LVARX and DLVARX forecasts in three of four cases, and statistically dominate the ARIMA forecasts in two of three cases.

Much of the literature that has examined the accuracy of tourism forecasting models has found that sophisticated methods, including error correction models, often produce forecasts which are no better than or inferior to those from relatively simple ARIMA models. 30\nIn the case of the HTM, based on formal tests of accuracy, we find that the HTM routinely outperforms other VARX competitors and has a slight advantage over its ARIMA competitor. In forecasting both Japanese visitor arrivals and room prices, the HTM dominates the ARIMA model at each forecast horizon, while the ARIMA model dominates the HTM for all forecasts of the occupancy rate. The relatively good performance of the VECM model suggests that the methodology warrants further study.",
