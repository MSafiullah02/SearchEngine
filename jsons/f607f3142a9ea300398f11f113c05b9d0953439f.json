WILLIAM L. HEWITT selected fields of health and medical science. The initial problems selected were malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and environmental health. At its second session, the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Committee for Health Cooperation agreed to further exploration in the field of influenza and other viral diseases; recommendations regarding areas of collaboration would be considered at the third session of the Joint Committee in Moscow in June 1974. On behalf of the development of these recommendations, a delegation of scientists from the United States visited the Soviet Union during February 17-27, 1974, for discussions with Soviet scientists in Leningrad and Moscow. The delegation was larger than the small group that had visited several institutes in these two cities in January 1973 [1] , and was able to collect additional information on Soviet research. This summary presents a synthesis of information collected by members of the visiting delegation regarding Soviet research in the five principal areas considered for possible joint collaboration.",

That the success of immunization with live virus has been limited is evidenced by continued research on new methods for attenuation and administration of virus and by the present emphasis on research in chemoprophylaxis. Furthermore, mass immunization is not yet undertaken on more than a city or regional basis, and no more than 50 million doses of vaccine are used each year. The eventual goal is the achievement of mass immunization of about 70% of the population. Such immunization would be nonselective, except that the vaccination of children would be emphasized. There is little interest in the use of inactivated vaccine by parenteral administration, although such vaccine is now being produced experimentally and is to be utilized, if approved, in hyperimmunization of volunteers for the production of immunoglobulin against influenza virus.",

Testing is stepwise in relation to volunteer susceptibility and is restricted to young adults. Thus, the live vaccine is successively tested in volunteers (five per group) with high, low, and undetectable levels of serum antibody, and then finally in groups of 20 antibody-negative subjects. Application of the vaccine to nonvolunteer populations in field trials requires the permission of the Ministry of Health. Selection of strains for the production of vaccines is made in the November through January period by a committee under the Ministry of Health; results of testing of the first three production batches in a total of 60 volunteers are submitted to the Laboratory of Biologic Control, which is part of the Tarasevich Control Institute for Biological Preparations of the Ministry of Health. Allantoic fluid vaccine is distributed to Sanitary-Epidemiologic Stations that arrange for and direct its use in organized population groups, such as industrial workers.

Preliminary experiments have attempted the recombination of freshly isolated virulent strains with attenuated \"laboratory\" viruses for the production of so-called \"biological recombinants\" that possess the antigens of the wild-type parent but are changed in other properties, such as virulence for mice. Cold adaptation of viruses by passage at 25 C is also under study.

These studies indicate that multiplication of virus is reduced after po adminstration, as evidenced by recovery of virus in low concentration only on the fifth day and a delay in antibody response when compared with that to intranasal vaccine. Immunogenicity is also reduced by po administration, so that three separate applications of the virus at 14-day intervals are required to achieve a reasonable rate of seroconversion.

These are estimated from data on registered morbidity in the location in which the initial outbreak occurs. It appears that data must be obtained for five to 14 days. Rvachev maintains that the estimates are maximal likelihood estimates. Once the epidemic-specific parameters have been estimated, predictions can be made for all locations in the Soviet Union. The interval between the date predictions are made and the peak of the influenza-ARD epidemic in the median location is about 1.5 months. These two parameters are said to embody virological and immunological factors associated with the epidemic. The model, however, does not consider such factors explicitly. Other variables and parameters in the model are the area's population and frequency distribution of length of influenza illness, obtained by averaging of data from a monograph by Zhdanov et al.

The Soviets show extensive plots of actual vs. predicted values of influenza-ARD morbidity; these plots indicate that the model predicts quite well. Timing of the epidemic and its intensity (measured by the number of registered cases in the location) have been used to assess predictive accuracy. A prediction is considered \"accurate\" if two conditions are satisfied. First, the day on which influenza-ARD reaches its highest level must be within five days of the day on which the peak is predicted to occur. Second, the following inequality must be satisfied: 0.7 < (highest predicted registered morbidity in location) / (highest actual registered morbidity in location) < 1.5. Using this definition of accuracy, recent tests have shown the model to be \"accurate\" 80% of the time.",
