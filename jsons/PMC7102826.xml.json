Each monomer of the trimeric HA is composed of two polypeptides generated by proteolytic cleavage of the HA0 precursor. The globular head of HA binds to sialic acid residues on target cells, while the stem region mediates the low pH-triggered fusion of viral and cellular membranes in endosomes. Sixteen subtypes of HA and two HA analogs identified in bats (H17 and H18) cluster in two groups: group 1 comprising H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17 and H18 and group 2 comprising H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15. Currently circulating human viruses belong to the group 1 subtype H1N1 (derived from the 1918 and 2009 pandemics) and to the group 2 subtype H3N2 (derived from the 1968 pandemic). Other subtypes such as H2N2 (endemic in humans in 1957\u20131968) [4] could re-emerge and others have caused episodes of zoonotic infections with no sustained human-to-human transmission, such as the group 1 H5 [5], H9 [6] and H6 [7], and the group 2 H7 [8] and H10 subtypes [9]. Influenza B viruses exist as a single type and are represented by two co-circulating antigenically distinct lineages defined by the prototype viruses B/Victoria/1987 and B/Yamagata/1988 [10].",

However, the poor supply of convalescent plasma and the low antibody titers hampered the utility of this approach. The identification during the last decade of several broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza A and B viruses, isolated from plasma cells or memory B cells of influenza-infected or influenza-vaccinated individuals, represents a safe and affordable alternative to the use of patient-derived convalescent plasma. Indeed, recent data suggest that passive immunization using broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies might represent a viable approach for prophylaxis and therapy that might complement or substitute current vaccines and antivirals. We will review the current literature on broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses and discuss their mechanisms of action and clinical development.",

In general, antibodies targeting the stem region of HA are rare as compared to those targeting variable regions in the globular head. The most frequent anti-stem heterosubtypic antibodies are those against group 1 viruses that were found to be elicited by both vaccination and infection by H1N1 viruses [28, 29]. X-ray structural analysis of three of such antibodies (CR6261, F10 and C179) revealed that they target a very similar epitope in the HA stem, contacting conserved residues in the Trp-21 hydrophobic pocket and Helix A regions [30, 31, 32]. Group 2 neutralizing antibodies are less frequent, possibly due to the shielding of HA stem epitopes by the conserved N38-bound glycan. Indeed, the solved structures of the Group 2 antibodies CR8043 and CR8020, and the negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction of the 9H10 antibody, indicated that their binding region is located in the membrane-proximal base of the HA stem [33, 34, 35]. Interestingly, in group 1 viruses this region is masked by a highly conserved N21-bound glycan.",

Despite the restricted propensity of the stem region to mutate, escape mutants have been isolated also for anti-stem antibodies [41, 42\u2022], and their existence is also supported by the incomplete breadth of certain anti-stem antibodies, for example, the lack of binding to human H2N2 viruses by CR6261 [30]. Finally, a rare antibody, CR9114, was shown to bind to several influenza A and B viruses tested, although neutralizing activity was limited to influenza A [23]. The breadth of CR9114 appeared to be the result of a high plasticity of its binding site that is able to accommodate the recognition of various conformations of the conserved tryptophan 21 in the presence of group-2 and influenza B-specific glycans.",

Recently, a universal epitope in NA conserved among all influenza A and B strains was identified and a rabbit monoclonal antibody raised against this region provided group 1 and 2 heterosubtypic protection in challenged mice [51, 52].

The mode of viral neutralization depends on the site recognized on the trimeric HA. Thus, while anti-head antibodies work primarily by inhibiting viral entry (they are detected by the classical hemagglutination inhibition assay, HAI), anti-stem antibodies do not block binding to sialic acid (they are inactive in HAI), but instead prevent endosomal viral fusion, viral budding or HA cleavage activation (Figure 2\n) [28, 56, 57].",

Importantly, Fc-dependent effector functions can be recruited by most influenza-specific antibodies, including anti-HA, anti-NA and anti-M2e. Fc\u03b3R-dependent mechanisms can be assessed in vitro by measuring antibody-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells (ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) or complement (CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity) as well as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) [39\u2022, 42\u2022, 44\u2022, 60, 61\u2022\u2022, 62, 63, 64].",

These studies revealed that Fc-mediated effector functions through activating Fc\u03b3Rs contributes to in vivo prophylactic efficacy of anti-stem antibodies at low antibody doses, while at high antibody doses protection is primarily mediated by virus neutralization [36, 60]. While there is a general agreement that anti-stem antibodies are potent inducers of ADCC in vitro and require Fc\u03b3Rs interaction for optimal in vivo protection, for anti-head antibodies the role of Fc-mediated effector function is still controversial [44\u2022, 60, 66]. The role of Fc-dependent effector mechanisms in mediating antibody-dependent in vivo protection has important practical implications given the possibility to enhance these functions by glyco-engineering or mutating the Fc portion or even by a combination of the two [67, 68].",

Interestingly, recent studies suggest that ADCC of influenza-infected cells can be enhanced by the accessory interaction between HA on the infected cell and sialic acid motifs on NK cells that may stabilize the immunological synapse, thus increasing the avidity between target and NK cells [61\u2022\u2022, 62]. These findings are consistent with the observation that the only anti-head antibodies that induce ADCC are those that do not interfere with binding of sialic acid (therefore HAI-negative) [61], Conversely, HAI positive anti-head antibodies by blocking binding to the sialic acid are not or less effective in promoting ADCC [62, 69\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, the interaction between HA and NK cells was found to be dependent on sialylation of the NK cell receptor NKp46 [70]. NA-mediated removal of sialic acid from the NKp46 was shown to represent an immune-evasion mechanism of influenza viruses. Reciprocally, inhibition of NA activity by oseltamivir was shown to boost NKp46 recognition and killing of infected cells [71] a finding that might explain the synergistic or additive effect observed in animals treated with anti-stem antibodies in the presence of NA-inhibitors [37]. The antibody-dependent recruitment of C1q on virions can contribute directly to antibody-mediated virus neutralization through a steric hindrance effect [72, 73], whereas C1q recruitment on infected cells activates the complement cascade leading to their killing (CDC). Interestingly, stem-specific antibodies are particularly effective in inducing CDC, possibly due to the recruitment of the complement cascade in proximity of the cell membrane [74].",

In young pigs polyclonal non-neutralizing antibodies induced enhanced respiratory disease (defined as vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, VAERD) [77, 78].

Although the NA inhibitors have been used off-label in this population, their effectiveness is limited, highlighting the unmet medical need for more effective treatment of influenza in populations at high risk for morbidity and mortality. However, their effectiveness is still debated, highlighting the unmet medical need for more effective treatment of influenza in populations at high risk for morbidity and mortality [80]. Antibody-based strategies to prevent and treat influenza could be a new alternative countermeasure for influenza. Preclinical studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies showed superior efficacy and longer therapeutic windows compared to neuraminidase inhibitors in mice and ferrets [37, 39\u2022] suggesting that antibody therapy may provide significant clinical benefit to this population.",

MedImmune has now completed a Ph2a study in non-hospitalized naturally infected patients and Genentech is currently recruiting two different phase 2 trials, one in naturally infected uncomplicated subjects, and one in naturally infected hospitalized subjects (ex-US). With several promising antibody candidates progressing to later stages of development in hospitalized subjects with severe influenza, it is worth noting that this indication presents significant challenges to clinical development. Recent failure of neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir in this indication [84], has highlighted some of the challenges that antibodies will also face, such as the lengthy recruitment timelines due to the patient population, the seasonality of the virus and the uncertainty of what pivotal trial endpoints will show enhanced efficacy over the standard of care.",

Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies to all subtypes of influenza viruses not only provides a basis for the design of more protective vaccine strategies but also opens the door to the alternative passive immunization approach to preventing influenza infection.
