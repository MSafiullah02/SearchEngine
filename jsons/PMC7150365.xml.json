In many host\u2013pathogen associations, the molecular war was in progress a long time ago. Nevertheless, a disease as an outcome of a pathogen attack remains an exception rather a rule. Most host species have acquired strategies by selective pressure to mislead the pathogen and to win fight during their crosstalk (i.e., molecular dialogue). However many pathogen species have acquired strategies by selective pressure to bypass the host defenses to win the molecular war and to ensure the completion of its life cycle. Pathogens remain a significant threat to any host species. Critical to the mitigation of this threat is the ability to rapidly detect, respond to, treat, and contain the pathogen transmission. For many centuries, some scientific fields (i.e., agroecology, evolutionary ecology, evolutionary medicine, biochemistry, microbiology, medicine, veterinary medicine, immunology, and molecular biology) have surveyed host\u2013parasite interactions to improve our understanding of pathogenic diseases and to prevent pathogen transmission in host populations.",

In Europe, one of the most dramatic disease events was the great plague pandemic of the mid-fourteenth century (Watts, 1997, Achtman et al., 2004). Notably, pathogenic diseases are a leading cause of premature death in the world. Pathogenic diseases result from an intimate relationship between a host and a pathogen which involves molecular \u201ccrosstalk.\u201d Clearly, elucidation of this complex molecular dialogue between host and pathogen is desirable in order to improve our understanding of pathogen virulence, to develop pathogen-specific host biomarkers, and to define novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. Proteomics applications to decipher host\u2013parasite interactions are in their infancy and should lead to new insights on host specificity and on the evolution of pathogen virulence. In this chapter, we present the interest of proteomics to survey host\u2013pathogen interactions, a synthetic review of previous proteomics studies, the pitfalls of the current approach in surveys, new conceptual approaches to decipher host\u2013parasite interactions, a new avenue to decipher the crosstalk diversity involved in trophic interactions in an habitat (i.e., the population proteomics), and 5-year view for future prospects on proteomics and host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

Unfortunately, little progress has been achieved in the control of such diseases as malaria and sleeping sickness, despite decades of intensive genomic projects on host\u2013pathogen interactions, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics.

Although the basic blueprint of life is encoded in DNA, the execution of the genetic plan is carried out by the activities of proteins. The fabric of biological diversity is therefore protein-based, and natural selection acts at the protein level (Karr, 2008). At the end of the twentieth century it had become clear to many parasitologists and molecular biologists that knowing genome sequences, whilst technically mandatory, was not in itself enough to fully understand complex biological events like the immune response of a host to a pathogen infection or the molecular strategies used by pathogens to thwart the host defenses during their interaction (Barret et al., 2000, Ashton et al., 2001, Fell, 2001, Fields, 2001, Schmid-Hempel, 2008).",

The genomics era has revealed that: (1) DNA sequences may be \u201cfundamental,\u201d but can provide little information on the dynamic processes within and between host and parasite during their physical and molecular interaction (Barret et al., 2000, Ashton et al., 2001); (2) the correlation between the expressed \u201ctranscriptome\u201d (i.e., total mRNA transcription pattern) and the levels of translated proteins is poor (Anderson and Seilhaver, 1997, Gygi et al., 1999, Maniatis and Tasic, 2002); and (3) a single gene can produce different protein products (Fell, 2001, Fields, 2001, Maniatis and Tasic, 2002). Moreover, the structure, function, abundance, and even the number of proteins in an organism cannot yet be predicted from the DNA sequence alone (Anderson and Anderson, 1996, Gygi et al., 1999, Barret et al., 2000). Also, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are often extremely important for the function of many proteins, although most of these modifications cannot yet be predicted form genomic or mRNA sequences (Gygi et al., 1999). Thus, the biological phenotype of an organism is not directly related to its genotype (i.e., DNA sequences).",

            "text": "Proteomics is the study of the proteome. In a broad sense, the proteome (i.e., the genome-operating system) means all the proteins produced by a cell or tissue. Proteomics will contribute to bridge the gap between our understanding of genome sequence and cellular behavior. Proteomics offers an excellent way to study the reaction of the host and pathogen proteomes (i.e., genome-operating systems) during their complex biochemical crosstalk (Biron et al., 2005a, Biron et al., 2005b). Using the first generation proteomics approach, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS), posttranslational modifications of host and pathogen proteins (such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and methylation) in reaction to their interaction can be detected. Such modifications are vital for the correct activity of numerous proteins and are being increasingly recognized as a major mechanism in cellular regulation. Although 2-DE offers a high-quality approach for the study of host and/or pathogen proteomes, several proteomics tools have been developed that complement this approach (Gygi et al., 1999, Fung et al., 2001, Lopez and Pluskal, 2003, Wu et al., 2003, Bischoff and Luider, 2004). Table 11.1\nshows a comparison of the most popular proteomics tools.",

Indeed, the broad immunity has a natural or innate and adaptive component. Innate immunity constitutes the first antimicrobial defense and rapidly induces soluble mediators such as complement, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines together with effector cells such as macrophages and natural killers, in order to control or delay the spreading of the infectious agent. Then a specific response of adaptive immunity will take place to eliminate pathogens that would have survived innate immune response (Roitt and Delves, 2001). These immune selective pressures have conducted pathogens to develop mechanisms to modulate and alter host responses or to evade phagocytosis. As a result of these host pathogen interactions, protein expression profiles of the host immune system (susceptibility/tolerance factors: antibodies, cell receptors, biochemical pathway, \u2026) and of the pathogen (virulence/pathogenicity factors: antigens, immunomodulators) are mutually modified (Zhang et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2008; Holzmuller et al., 2008).",

In fact, these molecular dialogues and conflicts can be seen as a chess game between the host immune cell populations and the pathogen populations, in which the pathogen plays with the whites (i.e., it starts the game). Because of differences in host\u2013pathogen organisms\u2019 size and ratio, leading to size differences of respective proteomes, the pathogen proteome could be considered as overwhelmed by the host proteome during the interactions. But in terms of immune evasion, this is not limiting because the immune system works on a qualitative basis, which constitutes a second advantage for the pathogen that can induce large-scale damages with low amounts of molecules. By contrast, this represents one major limitation to characterize host\u2013pathogen interactions, but also a challenging perspective for proteomics technology. This is why retrospectively proteomics studies were mainly conducted to evidence pathogenic virulence and pathogenicity factors (Ouellette et al., 2003, Texier et al., 2005, Sims and Hyde, 2006, Van Hellemond et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2008a, Liu et al., 2008b, Bird and Opperman, 2009, Jagusztyn-Krynicka et al., 2009, Premsler et al., 2009, Weiss et al., 2009, Steuart, 2010, Bhavsar et al., 2010, Holzmuller et al., 2010).",

In African trypanosomes, the antigenic variation of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) constituting the surface coat of the parasite is well described (Morrison et al., 2009). But as in proteomics study, the parasite population, which has switched the VSG, is so poorly represented it goes undetected, and therefore always keeps one step ahead of host immune responses. Also, in trypanosomatids, Leishmania amastigotes, which establish within macrophage (a major immune effector cell), developed the ability to degrade class II major histocompatibility complex molecules to prevent Th1-type immunity to be induced (Antoine et al., 2004). This strategy can be likened to the concept of histocompatibility testing in the case of transplant to avoid rejection of non-self by the recipient. Another protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, generates its parasitophorous vacuole with elements of the plasma membrane from the targeted host cells, thus using the host \u201cself\u201d to evade immune recognition (Plattner and Soldati-Favre, 2008). These few examples perfectly illustrate how difficult it is to decipher, at the protein level during interactions, the pathogen molecular components involved in immune evasion. Nevertheless, advances in proteomics offer challenging perspectives to decipher the molecular war in host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

For human diseases or those of livestock, the biological fluid, which should enable the detection of infection in the host serum linked to host proteome response. Several studies performed on this biological sample have allowed discriminating host\u2013commensal from host\u2013pathogen interactions in Candida albicans (Pitarch et al., 2009) and determining the immunome of pathogens (Sakolvaree et al., 2007, Ju et al., 2009). Moreover, in African trypanosomiasis, proteomics analysis of the serum not only was indicative of the host response to infection, but also was promising for characterizing disease progression toward neurological disorder (Papadopoulos et al., 2004, Agranoff et al., 2005). This illustrates how proteomics will help in considering at different analytical levels the host proteome response to a pathogen infection, with the prospect of benefits in improving diagnostic and therapeutic.",

This mass spectrometric-based method requires a minimal amount of sample for analysis and allows the rapid high-throughput analysis of complex protein samples (De Bock et al., 2010). SELDI-TOF-MS differs from conventional matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-TOF-MS because the target surfaces to which the proteins and matrices are applied are coated with various chemically active ProteinChip\u00ae surfaces (ion exchange, immobilized metal affinity capture, and reverse phase arrays). Therefore, it is possible to fractionate proteins within a mixture, or particular classes of proteins, on the array surface prior to analysis. As with MALDI, different matrices can be used to facilitate the ionization and desorption of proteins from the SELDI array surface (Merchant and Weinberger, 2000).",

By using two treatments, the injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and a sterile injury, Vierstraete et al. (2004) were able to disentangle proteome modifications induced by immunity from those induced by a physical stress. Levy et al. (2004) studied the immune response of the fruitfly Drosophila to bacterial (Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli) and fungal (Beauveria bassiana) infections. The data revealed that 70 of the 160 protein spots detected were differentially expressed at least fivefold after a bacterial or fungal challenge. In addition, the majority of these spots were specifically regulated by one pathogen, whereas only a few spots corresponded to proteins altered in all cases of infection. In summary, the classical approach in parasito-proteomics has many benefits in terms of understanding fundamental aspects of gene\u2013protein functional interactions. Unfortunately, it is not applicable to different pathogen species (and as such, does not encourage the growth of knowledge of general host proteome responses), nor does it necessarily help in the creation of a proteomic database with a holistic relevance to the understanding of host\u2013parasite interactions.",

(2008) have demonstrated by using a battery of proteomic techniques to characterize the plasma membrane subproteome of bloodstream form of T. brucei that these techniques are complementary since each one has identified a unique subset of proteins of the plasma membrane. Although 2-DE offers a high-quality approach for studying the host and/or parasite proteomes, several proteomic tools have been developed that will complement this traditional proteomic tool (see Table 11.1). In the same way, MS analysis could take advantages of combined techniques. For example, the widely used analysis of peptides via collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) is rapid and results in reproducible predictable fragmentation behavior for a given peptide sequence, a substantial proportion of peptide product ion mass spectra does not result in successful sequence identification (Steen and Mann, 2004). This is well illustrated by Hart et al. (2009), who showed that a substantial number of proteins from trypanosome flagellum were identified in their three independent flagellar proteome investigations, but also that combining electron transfer dissociation (ETD) with CAD allowed the identification of 168 proteins that were not recognized in their first analysis. This strengthens the idea of integrating both approaches and technologies to reach exhaustive protein datasets from a given biological compartment.",

The plant defense response is mediated by disease resistance genes (R genes), which are abundant throughout the genome and confer resistance to many microorganisms, nematodes, and/or insects (Dixon et al., 2000). R genes of several families of plants studied to date show homology with the Drosophila receptor Toll and the mammalian interleukin-1 receptor (Rock et al., 1998). In addition, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates produce the \u201cdefensins\u201d class of peptides, which are pathogen-inducible (Broekaert et al., 1995, Hoffman, 1995). Some peptides and/or proteins used by phytophagous or animal parasites to modify the genome expression of their host, share many structural and functional homologies. Thus, for example, phytoparasitic root-knot nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne secrete substances into their plant hosts in order to make a giant cell used as a feeding site (Abad et al., 2003, Doyle and Lambert, 2003). A similar system is observed for the zooparasite Trichinella spiralis (Stichosomida: Trichinellidae) (Jasmer, 1993). Furthermore, the injection of a peptide isolated from nematode secretions to either plant protoplasts or human cells enhances cell division (Goverse et al., 2000). The mechanism is not yet well-known but protein induction is considered as a strong possibility.",

From an evolutionary-ecological point of view, host immune responses to a particular parasite can be plotted on a chart according to the immune mechanisms used (constitutive versus induced) and degree of specificity. The first axis of the defense chart refers to the immune mechanisms employed by the host with the two extreme cases: (1) a constitutive immune mechanism used by the host to rapidly impair the invasion by a parasite; and (2) an induced immune mechanism which has the advantage of avoiding a costly defense system, yet meanwhile has the disadvantage that the parasite might escape host control (Schmid-Hempel and Ebert, 2003). The second axis of the defense chart refers to the degree of specificity of the host immune response.",

These parasito-proteomics surveys on the parasitic manipulation hypothesis showed that proteomic tools and the conceptual approach suggested by Biron et al., 2005a, Biron et al., 2005b are sensitive enough to disentangle host proteome alterations and also the parasite proteome alterations linked to many factors such as the circadian cycle, parasitic status, parasitic emergence, quality of a habitat, and manipulative process.\n",

Other studies have also highlighted the pathogenic changes in the brain of SIV-infected monkeys (Pendyala et al., 2009), adaptive metabolic changes in Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma congolense (Gr\u00e9baut et al., 2009, Roberts et al., 2009) or molecular biomarkers of intestinal disorder induced by H. pylori or Tritrichomonas muris (Wu et al., 2008, Kashiwagi et al., 2009). More recently, the use of model organisms interacting with infectious agent of medical importance emphasized the complexity and pathogen-specificity of the worm\u2019s immune response (Bogaerts et al., 2010). Taken together these examples demonstrate the potential of the concept of pathogeno-proteomics and promote this new research avenue.",

Current interactomes are only a part of the whole set of possible interactions occurring within an organism or between organisms. They are generally assembled from the results of large-scale two hybrid screens (LS-Y2H) around 6000, 4000, 23,000, and 5500 interactions for yeast (Uetz et al., 2000, Ito et al., 2001), the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (Maupas) (Li et al., 2004), Drosophila spp. (Giot et al., 2003, Formstecher et al., 2005), and humans (Rual et al., 2005, Stelzl et al., 2005), respectively; and the interactions identified by low-scale experiments described in the literature that may be eventually compiled in specialized databases (e.g., INTACT [Hermjakob et al., 2004], MINT [Zanzoni et al., 2002], HPRD [Peri et al., 2003], BIND [Alfarano et al., 2005]).

Some of these methods use the functional annotations of the protein (such as Gene Ontology annotations) to annotate the functional modules they predict. Based on the characteristics of a protein of unknown function to some of these annotated modules or classes, a putative function for such proteins can be proposed (Brun et al., 2003). Currently, specialized methods are being developed to investigate the interactomes. But it is clear that the field starts to move forward.

The first pathogens to be investigated in terms of their interactomes were the hepatitis C virus (Flajolet et al., 2000) and the bacterium, H. pylori (Rain et al., 2001). More recently, the interactomes of the herpes viruses (Uetz et al., 2006) and the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (LaCount et al., 2005), have been determined. This makes one believe that in the near future, as initiated by Uetz et al. (2006), the docking of the interactomes of pathogens onto those of their hosts will be possible. The analysis of the host\u2013pathogen interactome (i.e., \u201cdocked interactomes\u201d) during the host\u2013pathogen crosstalk is certainly a very promising and exciting aspect of interactomics because of its obvious potential impacts on human and animal health (Figure 11.2\n). The host\u2013pathogen interactome will permit to identify host and pathogen protein networks linked to specific functions during their interaction.\n",

Instead, human population proteomics focuses on interrogation of a selected number of proteins but from a large number of individuals, to delineate the distribution of specific protein modifications within these subpopulations. Hence, targeted protein analysis approaches utilizing MS as detection method are employed. MS measures a unique feature of each fully expressed protein\u2014its molecular mass. Changes in the protein structure resulting from structural modifications are reflected in its molecular mass and can be detected via MS, without a priori knowledge of the modification. The MS methods utilized in human population proteomics must be capable of analyzing hundreds if not thousands of samples per day, with high reproducibility and sensitivity. Hence, top-down MS approaches utilizing affinity ligands are the most likely methods of choice for population proteomics (Nedelkov, 2006). Surface-immobilized ligands can be utilized to affinity to retrieve a protein of interest from a biological sample, after which the protein (with or without the affinity ligand) is introduced in a mass spectrometer. One of the first affinity MS methods developed was mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) (Nelson et al., 1995). The approach combines targeted protein affinity extraction with rigorous characterization using MALDI-TOF MS (Figure 11.4\n). Protein(s) are extracted from a biological sample with the help of affinity pipettes derivatized with polyclonal antibodies. The proteins are eluted from the affinity pipettes with a MALDI matrix, and are MS-analyzed. Enzymatic digestion, if needed, is performed on the MALDI target itself. Specificity and sensitivity, as in traditional immunoassays, are dictated by the affinity-capture reagents\u2014the antibodies.",

Once this mass value is confirmed (or observed to be shifted), the presence of protein modifications is noted by the appearance of other signals in the mass spectra (usually in the vicinity of the native protein peaks), or by mass shifts of the major protein signal. Modifications can be tentatively assigned by accurate measurement of the observed mass shifts (from the wild-type protein signals and/or in-silico calculated mass) and knowledge of the protein sequence and possible modifications.

The overall frequency of the modifications in the 96-sample cohort was wide ranged. Fourteen modifications were observed in all 96 samples, suggesting that they must be regarded as wild-type protein forms. Others, such as most of the point mutations, were present in only few of the samples. Overall, 23 of the modifications were observed in more than 65% of the samples, and 20 in less than 15% of the 96 samples analyzed. Upon further data analysis, and taking into the consideration the gender, age, and ethnicity of the individuals who provided the samples, it was determined that the Gly6Ser mutation in TTR was detected only in individuals of Caucasian origin, which is consistent with existing knowledge about the occurrence of this common nonamyloidogenic population polymorphism in Caucasians (Connors et al., 2003). Another correlation was observed in regard to interprotein variations in specific individuals: all seven individuals for which carbohydrate deficient transferrin was detected were also characterized with deglycosylated antithrombin III.",

Variants resulting from oxidation were observed most frequently, along with single amino acid truncations. Least frequent were variants arising from point mutations and extensive sequence truncations. In total, six modifications were observed with high frequency (present in >80% of the samples), five were of medium frequency (20\u201350% of the samples), and sixteen were low frequency modifications observed in <7% of the samples. Nine of the low frequency modifications were not observed in the 96 individuals studied. Thus, by increasing the size of the population, it became possible to detect these low-occurrence protein modifications. When the frequencies of the modifications in the two studies were compared, an excellent correlation was obtained. For example, in both cohorts \u223c7% of the individuals were characterized with carbohydrate deficient transferrin. Upon further data analysis based on the gender, age, and geographical origin of the individuals who provided the samples, it was determined that the samples obtained from California contained significantly less protein modifications than the samples obtained from Florida, Tennessee, and Texas, even though the samples from all four states were collected in the same way within a 3-month window in the spring of 2005, and stored under identical conditions until analysis. Correlations were also made in regard to the gender distribution of two protein modifications. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin was observed in \u223c1% of the females and \u223c10% of the males in the 1000-samples cohort. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin is an FDA-approved clinical biomarker for alcoholism, and this gender correlation can partially be explained by the higher prevalence of alcohol dependence in males than in females. The second gender correlation was related to cystatin C: all 10 of the cystatin C point mutations were found in males.",

As a direct consequence of this, the US government expanded its biodefense program, with studies ranging from basic research to applications in detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases caused by such microbiological agents. The net result of this has been great progress in understanding their genomics (Fauci et al., 2005). Efforts were focused on the three major categories of critical biological agents classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp#catdef). In the postgenomic era, the benefit of having the full sequence of the genomes of these agents is obvious. There are now genome sequences for a few isolates of each species, which have made studies of comparative genomics a reality and led to important discoveries, including the diversity of closely related isolates and the identification of new putative virulence genes (Fraser, 2004). In this way, breakthrough transcriptomics and proteomics studies promise further exciting results and surprises over the next few years, which hopefully will have highly beneficial applications in terms of combating the scourge of global bioterrorism (see Morse 2007).",

Also, environmental factors are traditionally viewed as \u201csetting the scene\u201d for the crosstalk rather than having any explicit role once it is underway. As a result, the effect of extrinsic factors on host susceptibility and pathogen virulence during a crosstalk has received little attention. However, it is common to find in populations of a pathogen species a substantial variation in the virulence, even when pathogens are collected in the same environment and at the same time. When a biological characteristic such as the virulence is variable for both genetic and environmental reasons, two individuals may differ because they differ in genotype, because they have had different environmental experiences, or both (Elliot et al., 2002). Unfortunately, the extent to which different individual pathogens and pathogen ecotypes display different virulence abilities is poorly documented and deciphered.",

Infections measured under laboratory conditions have shown that the environment in which hosts and pathogens interact may affect the range of host genotypes that can be infected with a given pathogen genotype in host pathogen associations (i.e. the specificity of selection). Despite this important fact, environmental fluctuations are often excluded in surveys on host\u2013pathogen interactions. Since most host\u2013pathogen interactions are in heterogeneous environments, there is a crucial need to take into account environmental conditions in proteomics surveys. The population proteomics would be a promising prospect to resolve interesting issues specific to host\u2013pathogen crosstalks in a varying environment (Figure 11.8\n). This kind of survey would bring pioneer molecular data to decipher the reaction norm of a genotype and to understand why pathogens sometimes evolve in a given environment toward high virulence and hosts toward high resistance. Also, these surveys would permit to assess the fixity or not of host\u2013parasite interactomes involved in a host\u2013pathogen association in a varying environment.",

            "text": "While healthy population protein diversity cataloguing is a pretty straightforward proposition, the ultimate question is how human population proteomics can enable better disease diagnosis and management. Because of the one-protein-at-a-time approach, most studies involving cohorts of sick versus healthy control samples must first make an \u201ceducated guess\u201d what proteins to analyze via population proteomics. To start with, there is plenty of existing data on specific plasma proteins and their quantitative modulations with specific diseases. Hence, these proteins would be the first to benefit from qualitative reassessment via human population proteomics; next in line are proteins that are within the biomarker proteins\u2019 interaction network and pathways. To illustrate this point, structural isoforms have recently been discovered for some well-established biomarkers such as cardiac troponin I (Jaffe and Van Eyk, 2006, Peronnet et al., 2006) and B-type natriuretic peptide (Brandt et al., 2006, Lam et al., 2007). These structural variants might prove to be better sensitivity and specificity biomarkers than the native proteins themselves. To assess their modulation with disease, quantitative assessments of the isoforms abundance can be made by comparing the ratios of the isoforms and the native protein signals, or via standard curve approaches. The MSIA present straightforward means of looking into the protein microheterogeneity using the well-established methods of immunoaffinity separation and mass spectrometric detection. As such, it is expected that MS-based immunoassays will readily be accepted into the clinical and diagnostic laboratories to study the effects of protein modifications in pathological processes and evaluate their potential as new biomarkers of disease.",

Over the past decade, strains of many common pathogens have continued to develop resistance to the drugs that once were effective against them. In the battle against pathogens, humankind has created new megatechnologies such as massive sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics, but without conceptual approaches based on the evolutionary concepts. Parasite genome sequences do not themselves provide a full explanation of the biology of an organism or on the molecular war involved in host\u2013pathogen associations. Since the 1990s, proteomic tools have been successfully employed in a large number of studies to find and identify proteins involved in biological phenomena, such as host\u2013parasite interactions. Even so, many studies have, as outlined earlier, revealed pitfalls in the approaches used. Thus, whatever the new technological advancements, it is apparent that parasitologists and molecular biologists should attempt to improve their experimental design. This new attitude will surely improve the reliability of the data deriving from proteomics studies and will open the way for an enhanced comprehension of many biological mechanisms. In this chapter, new ways based on evolutionary concepts are suggested to enable further elucidation of the molecular complexities of host\u2013 pathogen genome interactions. These new ways could help to increase the knowledge about the molecular war involved in host\u2013pathogen associations, taking into account the environmental factors.",

A cellular proteome is the collection of proteins found in a particular cell type under a particular set of environmental conditions, such as exposure to hormone stimulation. It can also be useful to consider an organism\u2019s complete proteome. The complete proteome for an organism can be conceptualized as the complete set of proteins from all of the various cellular proteomes. This is very roughly the protein equivalent of the genome. The term \u201cproteome\u201d has also been used to refer to the collection of proteins in certain subcellular biological systems. For example, all of the proteins in a virus can be called a viral proteome.Proteomicsthe large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions.

In the second dimension, they are separated by molecular weight using SDS-PAGE. To visualize the proteins, the gel is dyed with Coomassie Blue, silver, or other reagents. Spots on the gel are proteins that have migrated to specific locations.\n",
