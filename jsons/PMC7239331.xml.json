In the absence of interventions, an epidemic outbreak can be described by SIR models with constant spreading rate (Methods). In Germany, the first serious interventions occurred around March 9, 2020 and affected the case reports after an observation delay (a combination of incubation period with a median 5\u20136 days (32)) and a test delay (time until doctor is visited plus test-evaluation time that we assumed to be both about 2\u20133 days). Hence, to infer central epidemiological parameters, we considered the initial phase to be March 2 to March 15. The central epidemiological parameters estimated here will also be estimated under the full model with change points on the data records up to April 21, allowing for a consistency check.",

Converted to the basic reproduction number R0=\u03bb/\u03bc, we find a median R0=3.4 (CI [2.4, 4.7]), which is consistent with previous reports that find median values between 2.3 and 3.3 (18, 33, 34). Overall, the model shows good agreement with both new cases (Fig. 1 A) and cumulative cases (Fig. 1 B), which show the expected exponential growth (linear in log-lin plot). The observed data are clearly informative about \u03bb, I0 and \u03c3 (indicated by the difference between the priors (gray line) and posteriors (histograms) in Fig. 1, D to F). However, \u03bc and D are largely determined by our prior choice of parameters (histograms match gray line in Fig. 1, C and H).

As long as the number of infections and recoveries are small compared to the population size, the number of active infections per day can be approximated by an exponential growth (Fig. 1, A and B) with effective growth rate \u03bb*=\u03bb\u2212\u03bc (see Methods). As a consequence, \u03bb and \u03bc cannot be estimated independently. This is further supported by a systematic scan of the model\u2019s log-likelihood in the (\u03bb\u2013\u03bc)-space that shows an equipotential line for the maximum likelihood (Fig. 1I). This strongly suggests that the growth rate \u03bb* is the relevant free parameter with a median \u03bb*=28% (Fig. 1G). The control parameter of the dynamics in the exponential phase is thus the (effective) growth rate: If the growth rate is larger than zero (\u03bb>\u03bc), case numbers grow exponentially; if the growth rate is smaller than zero (\u03bb<\u03bc), recovery dominates and new cases decrease. The two different dynamics (supercritical and subcritical, respectively) are separated by a critical point at \u03bb*=0 (\u03bb=\u03bc) (35).",

We model the behavioral changes that are introduced at these change points to unfold over a few days (\u0394ti), but the changes in duration can be partly compensated by changes in the onset time (ti) (see Fig. 2C, scenarios). We chose priors for all parameters based on the information available to us up to March 28 (see Methods). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis by employing wider priors in the supplemental material (figs. S5 to S7 and table S2), which yielded consistent results. On March 28, the data were already informative about the first change point, and thereby helped to inform our forecast scenarios.",

The date of the change point was inferred to be March 7 (CI [3, 10])]; this inferred date matches the timing of the first governmental intervention which included cancellations of large events, as well as increased awareness. After this first intervention, the (effective) growth rate \u03bb*(t)=\u03bb(t)\u2212\u03bc decreased by more than a factor of 2, from median \u03bb0\u2212\u03bc=0.3 to median \u03bb1\u2212\u03bc=0.12, given that the recovery rate was inferred as \u03bc=0.13 (CI [0.09, 0.18]). At the second change point \u03bb(t) decreased from \u03bb1=0.25 to \u03bb2=0.15 (CI [0.12, 0.20]), which is larger than our prior assumption. The date of this change point was inferred to be March 16 (CI [14, 18])]; this inferred date matches the timing of the second governmental intervention including closing schools and some stores. After this second intervention, the median growth rate became \u03bb*(t)=\u03bb2\u2212\u03bc=0.02\u22480 and is thus in the vicinity of the critical point, yet still positive. The first two interventions thereby mitigated spread of COVID-19 in Germany by drastically reducing the growth rate, but the spread remained exponential. A third change point, when \u03bb(t) decreased from \u03bb2=0.15 to \u03bb3=0.09 (CI [0.06, 0.13]) was inferred on March 24 (CI [21, 26])]; this inferred date matches the timing of the third governmental intervention including contact ban and closing of all non-essential stores.

We showed that change points in the spreading rate affect the confirmed case numbers with a delay of about two weeks (median reporting delay of D=11.4 days plus a median change-point duration of 3 days). Thereby, we were able to relate the inferred change points to the three major governmental interventions in Germany: We found a clear reduction of the spreading rate related to each governmental intervention and the concurring adaptation of individual behavior (Fig. 3), (i) the cancellation of large events with more than 1000 participants (around March 9), (ii) the closing of schools, childcare centers and the majority of stores (in effect March 16), and (iii) the contact ban and closing of all non-essential stores (in effect March 23).",

In countries where major changes in test coverage are expected, this will have to be included as well. The methodology presented here is capable in principle of incorporating such details. It also lends itself to modeling of continuous drifts in the spreading rate, e.g., reflecting reactions of the public to news coverage of a catastrophic situation, or people growing tired of mitigation measures. Such further adaptations, however, can only be performed on a per-country basis by experts with an intimate knowledge of the local situation. Our code provides a solid and extensible base for this. For Germany, several developments in the near future may have to be included in the model. First, people may have transiently changed their behavior over the Easter holidays; second, we expect a series of change points, as well as continuous drifts, with governments trying to ease and calibrate mitigation measures.

Thus, this delay, combined with a current spreading rate that is still close to zero, indicates extremely careful planning of future measures is essential.",

In short, we assume that the disease spreads at rate \u03bb from the infected population compartment (I) to the susceptible compartment (S), and that the infected population compartment recovers (R) at rate \u03bc. This well-established model for disease spreading can be described by the following set of (deterministic) ordinary differential equations (see, e.g., Refs (5, 6, 20)). Within a population of size N,dSdt=\u2212\u03bbSINdIdt=\u03bbSIN\u2212\u03bcIdRdt=\u03bcI .(1)As a remark, during the onset phase of an epidemic only a very small fraction of the population is infected (I) or recovered (R), and thus S\u2248N\u226bI such that S/N\u22481. Therefore, the differential equation for the infected reduces to a simple linear equation, exhibiting an exponential growthdIdt=(\u03bb\u2212\u03bc)I    solved by    I(t)=I(0)e(\u03bb\u2212\u03bc)t .(2)Because our data set is discrete in time (\u0394t=1 day), we solve the above differential equations with a discrete time step (dI/dt\u2248\u0394I/\u0394t), such thatSt\u2212St\u22121=\u2212\u03bb\u0394tSt\u22121NIt\u22121=:\u2212ItnewRt\u2212Rt\u22121=    \u03bc\u0394tIt\u22121=:    RtnewIt\u2212It\u22121=(\u03bbSt\u22121N\u2212\u03bc)\u0394tIt\u22121=Itnew\u2212Rtnew .(3)Importantly, It models the number of all (currently) active infected people, while Itnew is the number of new infections that will eventually be reported according to standard WHO convention.

To account for this periodic variation, we modulated the number of inferred cases by the absolute value of a sine function with in total a period of 7 days. We chose this function as it is a non-symmetric oscillation, fitting the weekly variation of cases on a phenomenological level. For the amplitude of the modulation we chose a weakly informative Beta prior: fw\u223cBeta(mean=0.7,std=0.17) and for the phase a nearly flat circular distribution: \u03a6w\u223cvonMises(mean=0,\u03ba=0.01).",

            "text": "Since change point detection entails evaluating models with different numbers of parameters, some form of fair model comparison is needed. This is necessary to compensate for the higher flexibility of more complex models, as this flexibility carries the risk of overfitting and overconfident forecasts. The standard approach to avoid over-fitting in machine learning is cross-validation, and cross validation has recently also been advocated for Bayesian model comparison (e.g., (3, 36)), especially for models employed for predictions and forecasts. Thus, one would ideally like to compare the models with different numbers of change points by the probability they assign to previously unobserved data points. Technically this is measured by their out-of-sample prediction accuracy, i.e., their log pointwise predictive density (lppd):lppd = \u2211i=1Nlog(\u222bp(yios|\u03b8)ppost(\u03b8)d\u03b8)(6)where the vector [y1os,\u2026,y1os] is a an out-of-sample dataset of N new data points, and where ppost(\u03b8)=ppost(\u03b8|y,Mj) is the posterior distribution of the parameters, given the in-sample data y and the model Mj. In practice, the integral is approximated using a sufficient amount of samples from ppost(\u03b8). However, this approach is only reasonable if a sufficient amount of out-of-sample data are available, which is not the case in the early stages of a disease outbreak. Therefore, the pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy was approximated using Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) in PyMC3 to compute Eq. 6 individually for each left out data point based on the model fit to the other data points. The sum of these values, multiplied by a factor of \u22122 then yields the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) score. Thus, lower LOO-CV scores imply better models.",
