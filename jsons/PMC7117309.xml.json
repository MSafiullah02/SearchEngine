Aquatic Rhabdoviruses cause significant diseases in fish reared as part of the worldwide salmonid farming industry (Rocha et al., 2004). Among fish Rhabdoviruses, viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHS), of the genus Novirhabdovirus, often causes pronounced cumulative mortality of salmonids, especially rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Miller et al., 1998). The virus is enzootic in much of continental Europe (Wolf, 1988) and has been found in North America (King et al., 2001, Snow and Smail, 1999). VHS is a notifiable disease, included in List II of the European Union Directive 93/54 (1993), and is known by several names including Egtved disease and infectious kidney-swelling and liver degeneration.",

(Wizigmann et al., 1980, Ahne and Thomsen, 1985, Meier et al., 1986). The virus has also been isolated from free-living marine fish in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (Meyers and Winton, 1995, Mortensen et al., 1999). Virus isolates from wild marine fish are serologically indistinguishable from normal fresh water isolates (Jorgensen and Olesen, 1987). VHS virus is transmitted by direct contact with either infected fish or contaminated water (Vestergard Jorgensen, 1973). Survivors from infection become carriers and shed the virus with urine and sexual fluids (Neukirch, 1985). Although the virus can be present on the surface of eggs, it is readily dissipated and there is no true vertical transmission (Vestergard Jorgensen, 1970). VHS infection in susceptible fish species is often lethal, due to impairment of osmotic balance; clinical signs include oedema and red haemorrhagic spots around the eyes and on the gills, and blood clots in body fat, viscera and muscle (Wolf, 1988).",

Serological tests have been used to diagnose VHS virus, and include the virus neutralisation test (Jorgensen, 1969, Jorgensen, 1972), a fluorescent antibody technique (Jorgensen, 1969, Enzmann, 1981) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Olesen and Jorgensen, 1991). Yet serological tests along with other traditional means of diagnosing viral infection, including epizootiological data, direct light or electron microscopic observation and isolation of the virus in cell culture, are often time-consuming and expensive (Amos, 1985, Sanz and Coll, 1992). Recently, molecular biological techniques have been developed to improve diagnosis of fish pathogens by rapid and sensitive detection of pathogen RNA and DNA.",

However, diagnosis of VHS using this PCR test requires expensive equipment and reagents, rendering it unfavourable for use on a large-scale basis, or on-site. A novel, rapid and sensitive technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed by Notomi et al. (2000) and is capable of amplifying DNA or RNA under isothermal conditions with high specificity and efficiency. LAMP is based on the principle of autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis. The reaction is performed by a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of two specific inner primers and two outer primers (Notomi et al., 2000). A reverse transcriptase coupled LAMP assay has been used to detect West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004) and for rapid detection of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (Thai et al., 2004).",

It is clearly important to rapidly identify and differentiate the causative agents of fish diseases to prevent further disease transmission or outbreaks (Bruchhof et al., 1995). VHS is one of several Rhabdoviruses that affects the aquaculture industry, and causes disease with high mortality among salmonids (Miller et al., 1998). Difficulties associated with isolation of viruses from clinical specimens has lead to development of rapid and reliable virus detection assays (Parida et al., 2004) including many RT-PCR assays developed for diagnosis of VHS (Bruchhof et al., 1995, Einer-Jensen et al., 1995, Miller et al., 1998, Strommen and Stone, 1998, Guillou et al., 1999, Williams et al., 1999). Despite the simplicity of the RT-PCR reaction, its requirements for a high precision thermacycler and elaborate methods for detecting the amplified products have restricted its wide use as a routine diagnostic tool (Thai et al., 2004). To overcome these issues, Notomi et al. (2000) developed a novel nucleic acid amplification assay: loop-mediated isothermal amplification. The LAMP reaction has been used successfully to detect fish viral infections (Caipang et al., 2004, Gunimaladevi et al., 2004, Gunimaladevi et al., 2005), and has been applied to the detection of VHS in the present study.",

The reaction is executed in a single tube and only requires a simple water bath or heating block to provide a constant temperature of 63 \u00b0C for 1 h. The LAMP reaction relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis and utilises a set of four specially designated inner and outer primers (Notomi et al., 2000) which are used during the initial steps of the reaction. During the subsequent cycling reactions, only the inner primers are used for strand displacement DNA synthesis (Parida et al., 2004). Each inner primer contains two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and antisense sequences of the target DNA. The primers form stem-loop structures which initiate self-priming DNA synthesis, and serve as the starting material for the subsequent LAMP cycling reaction (Kuboki et al., 2003). To further reduce the reaction time, two additional loop primers were used to hybridise to the stem-loops formed by the outer primers. The loops hybridised by the inner primers subsequently prime strand displacement DNA synthesis (Nagamine et al., 2002).",

The amplified products appeared as a ladder-like pattern on the gel due to the formation of a mixture of stem-loop DNA products with varying stem lengths, and cauliflower-like structures of multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target sequence in the same strand (Thai et al., 2004). The assay used SYBR Green I DNA staining as a rapid, specific method for detection of amplification products. Visual detection is possible due to the high specificity and amplification efficiency of LAMP (Iwamoto et al., 2003), and to the high binding affinity of SYBR Green I to DNA (Karlsen et al., 1995). Visual inspection is a superior detection method as there is no need for gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide; only 1 \u03bcl of diluted SYBR Green I was required to visualise the reaction products: a distinct green colour indicated a positive result while orange indicated negative. All samples which tested positive by visual inspection were positive also when analysed by electrophoresis; there were no samples which were negative by visual examination but which tested positive by electrophoresis.",
