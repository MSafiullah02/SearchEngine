We present the case of a 55-year-old female who developed cranial nerve symptoms after a 20-year history of HAM/TSP. Although multiple white matter lesions were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, no abnormalities were seen on a systemic computed tomography scan. Quantitative flow-cytometric analysis of cell populations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed that most of the infiltrating cells were not inflammatory cells, but HTLV-1-infected CD4 + CADM-1 + T-cells completely lacking CD7 expression. As stepwise downregulation of CD7 is correlated with disease progression from HTLV-1 carrier to aggressive ATL, the CSF cells were classified as aggressive ATL; these cells exhibited a more progressed phenotype than those in peripheral blood (PB). HAM/TSP disease activity was estimated to be low. From these and other examinations, we made a diagnosis of acute-type ATL, which unusually developed in the central nervous system at initial onset prior to systemic progression. In ATL cases with a challenging diagnosis, immunophenotypic characterization of CSF and PB is valuable for differential diagnosis and understanding disease status.",

HTLV-1 is transmitted vertically from mother to child via breastfeeding or horizontally by sexual intercourse and contaminated blood products [1] . Although the majority of HTLV-1-infected people remain asymptomatic for life, approximately 0.25 to 3% of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and another 5% develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) [2] . ATL occurs preferentially in older people with a median age of diagnosis of 68 years and slightly more in men [3] . ATL usually develops after decades of a non-symptomatic incubation period since the first infection, mostly via breastfeeding from an HTLV-1-carrier mother [2, 3] . By contrast, HAM/ TSP occurs three times more often in women as in men and preferentially at around 40 years of age [2] . HAM/TSP can develop with various incubation period lengths from several months to 30 years after vertical or horizontal transmission [2] . The CD4 + CD25 + CCR4 + T-cell population, which is generally recognized as a subset that includes regulatory T (Treg) cells and Th2 cells, is the predominant viral reservoir of HTLV-1 in both ATL and HAM/TSP [4] . During ATL, the FOXP3 + population, which has Treg-like characteristics immunophenotypically and functionally, is maintained, leading to suppression of normal immunity in favor of tumor proliferation [4] . By contrast, the primary HTLV-1-infected T-cells in patients with HAM/TSP become Th1-like cells with reduced FOXP3 expression that overproduce interferon-gamma, resulting in over-reactive inflammation in the spinal cord [2, 4, 5] . Hence, the host immune response appears different between ATL and HAM/TSP [4, 5] .",

A neurological examination revealed spastic tetraplegia, a bilaterally positive Babinski's reflex, and an exaggerated deep tendon reflex in the upper extremities. Loss of the pupillary reflex and horizontal nystagmus were found bilaterally. No neck stiffness or any other meningeal irritation was observed. As these cranial nerve symptoms are not generally observed in HAM/TSP, the concurrence of another intracranial disease was suspected. Except for neurological findings, no abnormal signs including skin lesions were observed on a physical examination. The peripheral blood (PB) examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L, a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 29.9 \u00d7 10 9 /L. While morphologically normal lymphocytes accounted for 20% of WBCs, atypical lymphocytes were observed in 3.0% (Fig. 1 ). C-reactive protein content had increased slightly to 0.41 mg/dL, and albumin content had decreased to 2.8 mg/dL. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen, and corrected calcium levels remained within the normal limits. The level of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) was elevated at 1210 U/mL. The serum HTLV-1 antibody test was positive. Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or any other abnormalities was not detected using systemic computed tomography (CT). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that there were multiple lesions in the diffuse area of the bilateral frontal cerebral white matter, the corpus callosum, and the pons. These intracranial lesions were hypo-/isointense in T1-weighted images and hyperintense in T2-weighted images, but they were not enhanced by gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test revealed the cell count of 46.2/\u03bcL with large abnormal lymphocytes ( Fig. 1 ), protein content of 37.0 mg/dl, glucose content of 9 mg/dl, and LDH content of 66 IU/L. The CSF tested positive for the HTLV-1 antibody. Notably, the level of sIL-2R in the CSF increased remarkably to 7000 U/mL, which was approximately six times as high as the PB level ( Table 1 ). The proviral load of the CSF was also much higher than that of the PB. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using the CSF sample revealed that the sample was negative for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus, varicella zoster virus, Aspergillus, Candida albicans/glabrata, and tuberculosis.",

There were few neutrophils, monocytes, B-cells, NK-cells, and CD8-positive T-cells in the CSF, which ruled out rapid deterioration resulting from HAM/TSP and infectious intracranial diseases, such as a cerebral abscess, encephalitis, or meningitis. Most of the infiltrating cells were phenotypically homogeneous and Most infiltrating cells in the CSF were large abnormal lymphocytes with a vacuolized cytoplasm and a highly cleaved nucleus. By contrast, lymphocytes in the PB remained slightly atypical and small to medium in size positive for CD3, CD4, CADM-1, and CCR4 (not shown), but negative for CD7. By contrast, a small fraction of the CD4-positive cells in the PB consisted of three different cell populations as seen in a CD7 versus CADM-1 plot (Fig. 2h) . As reported previously, CD4 + T-cells that strongly express CADM-1 are HTLV-1-infected cells, and stepwise downregulation of CD7 in HTLV-1-infected cells is associated with disease progression from HTLV-1-carrier status to aggressive ATL [7] [8] [9] [10] . The difference in the expression pattern of CD7 and CADM-1 in CD4-positive cells implied a more advanced disease status in the CSF (Fig. 2g, h) , and the pattern in the CSF was very similar to that observed in aggressive ATL. Moreover, these infiltrating cells in the CSF were later cytologically categorized as class V. Taken together, the patient was finally diagnosed with acute-type ATL with CNS involvement.",

            "text": "Our patient already had another HTLV-1-induced disease, HAM/TSP, before she developed ATL. Concurrent development of HAM/TSP and ATL is uncommon, and few cases have been reported of patients with HAM/TSP who develop ATL and vice versa [6] . A high proviral load of HTLV-1 is a significant risk for both the progression of HAM and development of ATL [2] . Chronic meningomyelitis with axonal degeneration resulting from HAM/TSP leads to motor and sensory disturbances, but intracranial symptoms rarely occur because HAM/TSP particularly affects the middle to lower thoracic cord [2] . Therefore, the series of cranial nerve symptoms observed in our patient, including visual disturbance, deafness, facial palsy, cognitive impairment, and consciousness disorder were considered to be caused by another disease, which was finally concluded to be CNS involvement of ATL. The survival period from the onset of ATL to death was only 3 months, indicating that ATL had progressed rapidly in the CNS. As the survival period of acute-type ATL is generally short from a few weeks to months without chemotherapy [14] , early detection and intervention are important for ATL. When HAM patients present with unusual intracranial symptoms, multimodal assessments should be performed for differential diagnosis and evaluation of the disease status. Several CSF biomarkers have been studied for evaluating disease activity of HAM/TSP. The levels of neopterin and CXCL10 in the CSF are closely correlated with HAM/TSP disease activity [15, 16] . A previous study demonstrated that the median level of neopterin in the CSF of a deteriorating HAM/TSP patient is 20-30 pmol/mL, whereas most stable patients with HAM/TSP exhibited values of < 10 pmol/ mL [15] . CSF CXCL10 is also reported to distinguish between rapid and slow progressors with an optimal cutoff of 4400 pg/ml [16] . Although these markers are very useful to evaluate HAM/TSP disease activity, discriminating other diseases is difficult. Indeed, our patient presented with higher levels of neopterin and CXCL10 in the CSF, and CADM-1 but negative for CD7. These CD4-positive T-cells in the CSF exhibited an apparently advanced ATL profile compared with those in the PB. Only very small populations of CD4 + CD7P cells and CD8 + T-cells, which are the counterparts of uninfected CD4 + T-cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes respectively, were observed, and no significant infiltration of other cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, B-cells, and NK-cells, was detected although HAM/TSP disease activity seemed to be low. As CSF neopterin is reported to be a potential diagnostic biomarker of primary CNS lymphoma with an optimal cut-off value of 10 pmol/mL [17] , discriminating ATL in the CNS from deterioration resulting from HAM is difficult. Another marker suited for this purpose is CSF sIL-2R. In our case, there was an increased level of sIL-2R in the patient's CSF. According to previous studies, the majority of ATL patients with CNS involvement have elevated levels of sIL-2R in the CSF [18] , whereas levels of sIL-2R in the CSF of HAM/TSP patients are usually below detectable levels [15] . Though CSF sIL-2R might be a useful indicator of CNS ATL, additional assessments are necessary for definitive diagnosis as it could be elevated by other diseases with active T-cell responses.",

Typically, CSF samples of patients with HAM/TSP exhibit mild lymphocytic pleocytosis containing both CD4-positive HTLV-1-infected T-cells and CD8-positive cytotoxic cells targeting the HTLV-1 antigen [2] . In our case, there were few immune or inflammatory cells in the CSF, and most of the infiltrating cells in the CSF were immunophenotypically homogenous and strongly expressed CD4, CADM-1, and CCR4. Additionally, as few CD8-positive T-cells were seen in the CSF despite no use of an immunosuppressive agent, the HAM/TSP disease activity in this patient was considered to be low. The CD7 and CADM-1 expression pattern plotted for CD4-positive cells in the CSF was similar to the patterns often seen in patients with aggressive ATL [7] [8] [9] [10] . By contrast, the expression pattern of CD4-positive cells in the PB was similar to the pattern observed in high-risk HTLV-1 carriers or indolent ATL patients [7] [8] [9] [10] . This discrepancy between the CSF and PB was also supported by other clinical features found in this case, such as a normal level of serum LDH, no lymphocytosis, and fewer morphological abnormalities in peripheral lymphocytes. Based on these findings, we conclude that this patient newly developed aggressive ATL in the CNS, but the HAM/TSP was not exacerbated. A flow-cytometric analysis of the CSF was quite useful for differentiating between ATL in the CNS and HAM.",

The cases where the CADM1 + percentage exceeds 50% are unstable and at high risk of acute transformation. In such cases, the cumulative incidence of receiving systemic chemotherapy at 3 years was 28.4% [22] . Since the CADM1 + percentage, which is the total percentage of CD7D and CD7N in CD4-positive T-cells, were as high as 57.7% in this case, the risk for progression to aggressive ATL was considered to be high.
