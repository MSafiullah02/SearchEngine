Virions consist of the genome, a single or multilayered protein shell called capsid and in some cases an envelope of lipids. The simplest virions have only one segment of single-stranded nucleic acid encased in a capsid made up with multiple copies of a single polypeptide chain. The shape of virions can be helical, icosahedral, prolate, or have a complex irregular structure. Among them, icosahedral viruses represent more than 50% of all known viruses [1]. The structure of icosahedral viruses can be described by the Caspar\u2013Klug quasi-equivalent principle [2] and the number of proteins making up the capsid is 60 T\u2014where T  =  h2  +  hk  +  k2 is the triangulation number, and h and k are non-negative integers.",

This makes it possible to investigate the self-assembly mechanism of capsid proteins by various experimental techniques including small-angle x-ray scattering and static light scattering (SLS) [6\u201311], mass spectrometry [12\u201314], atomic force microscopy (AFM) [15, 16] and nanofluidic devices [17, 18]. On the other hand, a number of large-scale coarse-grained (CG) models [19], which represent one subunit with one or several beads, were used to explore the possible initial formation of metastable intermediates and their subsequent assembly to form a full capsid [20\u201323]. To achieve this, the CG beads interacted with each other through various pairwise potentials. However, the parameters entering these potentials, such as the association energy and the effective charge assigned to the CG bead, were rough estimates and their accuracy might be questionable in many cases. Evaluating reliably the interaction energy between self-assembling subunits from experimental data is therefore a crucial task for the construction of theoretical models bearing a predictive capability.",

            "text": "The investigations devoted to evaluating the interaction strength between capsid subunits are limited. A common method used by Ceres and Zlotnick [24] is based on the analysis of self-assembly kinetics. By fitting SLS data with a model of self-assembly kinetics derived from a nucleation-elongation growth process, the investigators were able to compute the apparent association energy between the self-assembling subunits of empty capsids. These experiments reported a rather low association energy of  \u22125 to  \u221210 kBTr [24] for the capsid dimers of an icosahedral plant virus, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and Tr the room temperature. The low association energy enables an efficient self-assembly by avoiding kinetic traps, which facilitates the formation of regular structures. In principle, one of the most promising methods to obtain the interaction strength between subunits with a satisfactory accuracy is the calculation of potential of mean force through all-atom computer simulations. However such simulations require a high-accuracy parameterization and are in addition still costly in computation time. More importantly, the ionic conditions play a crucial role, but the precise dynamical relationships between the ionized groups, the change of conformations and the configuration of the protein occurring in the course of the self-assembly process remain a formidable challenge [25, 26].",

Instead of studying the self-assembly process of viral capsid upon a change of pH or ionic strength, we dissociated the capsid by heating up the solution and we monitored the melting temperature by fluorescence thermal shift assay. We used cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), a T  =  3 single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) plant virus widely employed for physical and nanotechnological studies [28\u201330]. A mean field (MF) model was constructed to describe the dissociation of a viral capsid, whose subunits interact through a short-range hydrophobic attraction and a pairwise electrostatic Yukawa repulsion. Our model returned an overall association energy of  \u22124.6 kBTr and an effective charge per dimer of  \u22123 to  \u22125 e (e the electric charge) depending on pH.",

However, the hydrophobic interaction is considered to be the manifestation of entropic effects [36] and thus depends strongly on temperature. Some experiments on the self-assembly of different viruses showed that temperature could impact the self-assembly kinetics of viral capsids, yet the effect of temperature varies with the viral species. For instance, hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found to self-assemble faster at high temperature [24], whereas the self-assembly of CCMV capsid is more efficient at lower temperature [11]. To elucidate the reason of this discrepancy, it is relevant to study the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic interaction between capsid subunits.",

The scattering intensities at pD 7.5 and pD 4.8 are displayed in figures 2(c) and (d), respectively. For pD 7.5, we observed that the first scattering peak slightly shifted to high q-values upon raising temperature from 20 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C (figure 2(c)). By fitting the scattering intensities with a vesicle model, the radius of the capsid decreased from 14.5 nm at 20 \u00b0C to 12.5 nm at 65 \u00b0C, see figure 2(a). The shrinkage of CCMV capsid may result from the strengthening of hydrophobic interaction between capsid subunits due to its entropic nature. However, for pD 4.8, we did not found any significant variation for the scattering patterns between 20 and 62 \u00b0C (see figure 2(b)). It is probably because the subunits on capsid were already in close contact at pD 4.8 and 20 \u00b0C and there was no further space for shrinkage. Yet, at 72 \u00b0C the typical oscillations of the scattering patterns vanished, which indicated that the capsid proteins were probably in disordered state.",

The dependence of hydrophobic interaction on temperature can readily lead us to speculate that a high temperature would facilitate the self-assembly of CCMV capsids. However, there are experimental observations that the self-assembly of empty CCMV capsid is accelerated at low temperature [37]. These controversial conclusions reflect the complicated nature of the self-assembly process of viral capsids. In addition, by introducing a temperature dependence into the hydrophobic interaction, the effective charge of a CCMV subunit was reduced to an absolute value of 2, which is comparable to that estimated by the electrophoretic mobility of CCMV virions.",

Thus, the variation of the effective charge of the dimer can be mainly ascribed to the negatively charged body. In our preview paper [27], we found that the dissociation temperature of CCMV virions was not sensitive to salinity. Besides, electrophoretic mobility experiments also revealed that the isoelectric point (pI) of 22 residues cleaved CCMV protein in which the positive charge of N-terminal arm was totally removed is around 4.1 [39], while predictions obtained by the PDB2PQR package [40] gave an isoelectric point around pH 4.3 for CCMV protein without the first 22 residues. Therefore, we made an approximation of |Z|  =  0 at pH 4.2. If we assume that the hydrophobic interaction strength does not change in the presence of RNA, then D/\u03beg can be estimated to be ~2.76. The variation of the absolute value of the effective charge of dimer with pH is presented in figure 5(b). No matter whether the temperature effect was considered or not, the variation of the effective charge was similar: |Z| increased with pH and eventually reached a plateau at pH higher than 7. This variation was comparable with the change of electrophoretic mobility with pH for cleaved proteins [39]. In addition, we also found that the effective charge in the case of temperature-dependent hydrophobic energy was half of that obtained in the case of temperature-independent hydrophobic energy.",

In addition, it has been shown in our previous work [27] as well as in the preceding section of this paper that the dissociation of a viral capsid occurs through a sharp phase transition in homogeneous lattice model. However, the experiments on the dissociation of viral capsids by AFM found that there were a lot of metastable subassemblies equilibrium with partially dissociated capsids [5], which suggested that the interaction strengths between the subunits were not all the same and that the dissociation of a capsid might take place in more than one step. To test this hypothesis, a heterogeneous lattice model consisting of two kinds of sites with different hydrophobic interaction strengths was implemented and the effect of the hydrophobic interaction strengths on the stability of a viral capsid was assessed.",

For CCMV capsid, 60 AB dimers form 12 pentamers of dimers located at the vertices of an icosahedron (see figure 1). The pentamer of dimers is often reported to be one of most stable subassemblies in the CCMV capsid, whereas the 30 CC dimers act as glue between these pentamers to form a full capsid. Under this assumption, the weakly connected CC dimers will be dissociated firstly upon an increase of temperature, which is consistent with the fact that 30 subunits are dissociated during the first stage (figure 7(c)). The second stage can be attributed to the dissociation of the more stable pentamers at higher temperature.",

These findings point out the importance of the interaction strengths between capsid subunits and their dependence with temperature. We have therefore first implemented a temperature dependence into a homogeneous lattice model that has been proven useful to study phase transition in viral capsids [27]. The introduction of the temperature dependence on the hydrophobic interaction led to a lower and experimentally more reasonable effective charge for CCMV capsid subunits regardless the presence of genome. Despite the simplicity of our model which disregarded the various natures of short-range interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, van der Waals forces) and counted them into the hydrophobic interaction energy, we could gain fine insight into capsid phase transitions consistently with experimental data.",

When the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits was much weaker than that between AB subunits, the capsid dissociated through a two-step process, in which CC subunits dissociated first at lower temperature than AB subunits. By contrast, the capsid dissociated in a sharp one-step process when the hydrophobic interactions were all comparable, and both kinds of subunits dissociated simultaneously.",
