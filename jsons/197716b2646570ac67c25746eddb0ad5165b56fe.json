Our facility has recognized the critical role that family members play as partners in the care of 25 our residents. We continue to limit the number of persons coming into the building through 26 restricted visitors and volunteers; but, we are now designating Essential Family Caregivers 27 (EFCs). These EFCs are not there for social visits, but instead provide services that otherwise 28 would require a private duty caregiver, such as one-on-one direction or especially time-29 intensive hand feedings. EFCs are brought into the building under the same specific protocols 30 used with staff. (See Table)  31 32 Compassion, as well as optimal geriatrics care, requires family members be allowed at the 33 bedside of their loved ones not only in the final hours of life. In the months stretching out 34 ahead of us in the prevention of COVID-19, we must keep our residents safe from the risk of 35 circulating virus. We also must promote person-centered geriatric care allowing family 36 presence as essential caregivers. 37",

Family is not synonymous with visitor. 15My 10-year old daughter and her dance troupe are visitors and social isolation should limit their 16 performance in our building. The daughter who feeds her bedbound mother lunch or the 17 husband who combs and braids his wife's hair every morning, despite her anoxic injury that 18 prevents her spoken word, are not visitors in our buildings. Technology can help decrease 19 resident loneliness, but cognitive limitations and mobility impairment have increased the 20 isolation of some of our bedbound residents, especially those with severe cognitive impairment.
