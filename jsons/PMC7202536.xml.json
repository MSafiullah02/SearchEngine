            "text": "Every area of biological and biomedical research is rooted one way or another in understanding the precise order of nucleotides in DNA and RNA molecules, and how changes in these sequences subsequently alter downstream function and phenotype within and across generations. These principles apply to all living organisms, as well as to entities such as viruses that are considered by many as non-living organisms. Nucleotide sequence analysis has evolved considerably since Holley and colleagues reported the first complete sequence of a nucleic acid in 1965 [1]. This breakthrough was followed a little over 10 years later with a report from Sanger on the sequence the first DNA genome [2, 3]. These pioneering studies, and those of Maxam and Gilbert [4], provided the early foundation for technology improvements, including the dideoxy chain-termination method or Sanger sequencing [5], which collectively represent what is referred to as first-generation sequence analysis. With the subsequent discovery that the use of radioactive or fluorescent probes to infer nucleotide sequences could be replaced with a luciferase-based pyrophosphate synthesis method referred to as pyrosequencing [6], commercial next-generation sequencing (NGS) was born. Continued improvement in this technology, which relied on specially designed machines capable of performing tremendous numbers of sequencing reactions in parallel, enabled rapid development of high-throughput DNA sequencing that defined the era of second-generation sequencing. Even with these advances, however, all technologies to this point required target DNA amplification. The ability to perform single-molecule sequencing (SMS), and thus minimize biases and errors inherent in DNA amplification, heralded the transition to third-generation sequencing [7, 8].",

            "text": "One of the first widely used third-generation sequencing technologies is the single molecule real-time (SMRT) platform from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), which offers both high throughput capacity and long reads (10-kb or more). However, a significant limitation to PacBio sequencing is the relatively high first-pass error rate, which is around 8\u201311%. While the addition of \u2018bell adapters\u2019 to sequencing templates allows the templates to be read multiple times in a continuous circle, resulting in a highly accurate circular consensus sequence (CCS), the CCS approach is limited to application with short DNA fragments due to constraints on how long the polymerase remains active. Without an effective way to correct for errors, PacBio cannot be used to accurately sequence long molecules from heterogeneous DNA mixtures. Along with the PacBio SMRT platform, nanopore sequencing, such as that commercialized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), represents yet another example of the evolution of DNA sequencing technology [9]. Coupled with considerable improvements in chemistry and software, current versions of ONT sequencing platforms, such as MinION, produce consensus genome assemblies with an error rate less than 1.0% [10]. In parallel to this, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) \u2013 random oligonucleotide sequences specific to individual molecules that were first introduced to count molecules in a sample [11], have been employed in error correction approaches [12, 13]. However, high fidelity analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and their combinations in individual long molecules, especially in heterogenous samples, still remains a significant challenge.",

The LUCS technology utilizes 5' and 3' UMIs incorporated into each individual DNA molecule. permitting the construction of consensus genome sequences from analysis of individual long molecules in complex DNA mixtures. This enables construction of consensus DNA sequences from analysis of individual long molecules, as well as in-silico detection and removal of chimeras. Use of LUCS increased sequencing accuracy of the ONT MinION platform from ~85% to 99.99% (i.e., 1X10-4 errors/nucleotide). This vast improvement in accuracy and resolution over current DNA sequencing approaches, together with the inherently high resistance of LUCS to errors introduced through PCR, represents a significant step in the evolution of nucleic acid sequence analysis, with immediate applications to a broad array of critical research topics ranging from aging and cancer to mtDNA inheritance and organismal evolution.",

            "text": "To perform proof-of-concept testing for LUCS (Figure 1A) on a single-cell analytical level, we used mice with an amino acid substitution (D257A) in the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase-\u03b3 (Polg) gene [15]. Homozygous Polg mice (PolgD257A/D257A) exhibit an elevated rate of accumulation of mtDNA mutations, reaching ~13.6 mutations per mtDNA molecule during early adulthood, and thus serve as an excellent model for testing the sensitivity of SNV calling in our sequencing strategy. We selected oocytes as a prime single-cell study target since these cells contain an abundance of mitochondrial genomes for analysis. In our initial experimental design, UMIs were applied with barcoding primers and amplified in the same reaction with synthetic primers that capture each UMI sequence (Figure 1A; see also Table 1). Despite a low ratio of barcoding primer (1 \u03bcM) to synthetic (10 \u03bcM) primer concentration, the barcoding primer was sufficiently active in later stages of PCR to reassign UMIs to molecules that had already received them. This resulted in a complicated pair-end network of clusters of diminishing size. The inability to perform simple pair-end matches between the UMIs made chimera detection and accurate data analysis nearly impossible. Our methodology was therefore modified into a two-step PCR that allows for a 25-fold dilution of the barcoding primers following the four initial cycles when the UMIs are applied (Figure 1B; see Materials and Methods for details). This resulted in a vastly higher resolution of pair-end clustering, which allowed for identification of chimeras. This also supported the accuracy of the clustering algorithm to appropriately identify reads with matching UMIs.",

Support for a variant was assessed using reads aligned to this consensus in two ways: base-called support and signal support. Base-called support reports the fraction of aligned reads that support the variant at a given position in the consensus. Meanwhile, signal support refers to the raw feature files (in fast5 format) that estimate the likelihood of the variant. The distinction between base-called and signal support fractions is particularly important here because of the atypical GC-skew of mtDNA. Raw signal support was used to identify spurious variants that could arise from training the neural network of the nanopore base-caller for more standard or methylated genomes. A variant with a high base-called support but low signal support would support that the variant is a false positive, whereas the opposite would support a true variant despite lower support from the read alignment. Training a mtDNA-specific model for base calling is not possible due to the limited training of the ONT base caller, and this would result in over-fitting.",

Positions with signal support lower than 80% could be PCR artefacts from misincorporation of a nucleotide by the Taq polymerase early in the PCR cycling. Five such variants with signal support less than 80% showed support on only one strand and were therefore excluded from further analysis. Variants with low signal support, viz. those below 80%, were randomly distributed across consensus sequences, and no consensus contained more than one variant with low signal support. The presence of variants with high signal support (80% or higher) within the same consensus sequences suggests that the low support variants are a product of random error and not poor-quality clustering or issues with consensus building.",

Polymorphic sites were defined as the variant positions that are found in all molecules sequenced by Sanger from the same sample. Here, \"heteroplasmic variants\" refers to the frequency at which a variant occurs in the sample, not in the cluster of reads that generate the single molecule consensus. Both heteroplasmic and polymorphic variants would be expected in all reads of the same cluster, but only polymorphic variants would be expected in all reads across all clusters. Therefore, within a cluster of reads that represents a single molecule, base-called support and signal support for both heteroplasmic and polymorphic variants should be similar. The average base-celled support fractions for polymorphic (n = 36) and heteroplasmic (n = 96) variants were comparable at 90.1% \u00b1 1.7% and 89.2% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (mean \u00b1 SEM, P = 0.39).

However, even the most advanced third generation sequencing technologies (ONT and PacBio) that involve PCR produce sequences with error rates that are not compatible with high-resolution analysis of SNVs in long DNA molecules. Additionally, both ONT and PacBio sequencing rely on massive (~30-fold) consensus reads from multiple different molecules, generating sequence information on average genomes, not single molecules. In other words, individual sequence reads are essentially unrecognizable. The challenge of obtaining high-resolution reads across long spans of DNA are complicated even further when these analyses are performed with complex or heterogenous nucleic acid mixtures.",

            "text": "Consensus sequence building strategies are guided by support fractions. These are the proportion of single reads within a consensus that support the calling of a particular variant, and thus serve as essential indicators of how reliable a given variant is. For example, if the reference base is adenine, and 6% of reads are adenines, 1% are cytosines, 93% are guanines and none are a thymine, the support fraction is 93%. Because inherent error rates in third-generation sequencing fluctuate around 10\u201315%, support fractions that are significantly lower than 80% raise suspicion over the reliability of an identified variant. Any given consensus sequence has a broad range of support fractions for its identified variants. The implication of this is that low support fractions are not due to widespread quality issues associated with reads in a given consensus or with errors in clustering, but instead arise from more localized problems such as PCR error (e.g., comparable representation of two nucleotides at a given site) or context-specific alignment and base-calling errors (e.g., homopolymer tracts are challenging to base-call, and can also offset alignments if mutations occur within or near such tracts). By setting our consensus support fraction threshold with LUCS to 80%, it is possible that some genuine mutations were lost, but this comes with high confidence in the variants retained. Additionally, intermediate variants can always be processed for manual inspection to make the final call of whether to keep or drop a given variant. For variants identified with an 80% or greater support fraction, it would be nearly impossible for an error at any step in the process to accumulate into such a high support fraction. The only exception to this is first-cycle PCR errors; however, at present there is no PCR-dependent sequencing method that can detect or eliminate this source of potential error.",

These reads are then combined into a single consensus sequence. The total read length of CCS plateaus around 50-kb. However, to obtain the accuracy needed for high resolution studies of individual DNA molecules, ~10 reads need to be obtained from each molecule. Some scientists have claimed that this limits the length of the original molecule to no more than 5-kb [17, 18]. On the other end of the fragment length spectrum, next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as Illumina, are based on the high-fidelity sequencing of short DNA fragments (<300-bp). The \u201cdeep sequencing\u201d or high-coverage version of Illumina can be used to explore microheterogeneity, but this approach yields simply a list of variants and their frequencies.

As an example, we will close with a discussion of why a tool such as LUCS could revolutionize approaches to an area that is of high relevance and priority across the world at the present time. The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented efforts to contain the spread of the virus, and to characterize genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2. A global consortium is collecting genetic sequence information on a large scale in an attempt to determine mutational hotspots and the genetic trajectory of the virus. However, sequence data generated thus far that are available in public datasets are limited by incomplete genome coverage and sequencing-associated errors. With policy decisions, diagnostic procedures and treatment protocols rooted heavily in this type of information, the need for high resolution single-molecule analysis, which accurately depicts viral evolution at the level of both individuals and the pandemic, could not be clearer.",

Identification of quasispecies is considered vitally important for successful development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and drugs, as well as for elucidating complexities in variation, adaptation and infection patterns. The task of exploring quasispecies and the population genomics associated with acute progression of a viral infection in the human body in real time is a daunting one. Ideally, one would like to know the sequences of the entire genomes of a representative subset of the intrapatient viral population, sampled at several time points during the infection. This can be accomplished with great precision by cloning individual viral particles and then sequencing the clones by any convenient sequencing method. This precision, however, comes at a huge financial cost and with very high risks: most notably for the latter, a BSL-3/4 laboratory is needed for handling and cloning of live virus. Additionally, this is a time-consuming process in that, even with a dedicated production line, analytical outcomes are not available for many days.",

Indeed, precedent for this exists, with a very recent report of hepatitis-C treatment failure in a subset of patients linked to the emergence of HCV mutations in quasispecies that confer, in those patients, resistance to treatment with conventional therapies [21]. Therefore, detailed sequence information is essential for elaborating the basis of viral adaptive responses in individual hosts during the course of the disease, which will help define the transmission, pathogenicity and treatment strategies for viruses, especially those that are new like SARS-CoV-2, in real time.",

However, a critical difference between LUCS and this modified CCS approach is that the latter is restricted to analyses of genomic DNA samples that do not require PCR amplification [22, 23]. Hence, this new approach, while accurate, is not feasible with current DNA sequencing platforms that require PCR. This fundamental difference underscores the advantage of using LUCS for high-throughput studies of molecular targets-like mtDNA and viral nucleic acid sequences. In addition to the fact that LUCS can be used with either of the two existing third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio or ONT), its greatest strength is that LUCS is resistant to the introduction of PCR-based errors. Thus, in sequencing situations where PCR amplification is obligate (e.g., genomic analysis of single cells, or of pathogens in clinical samples where the number of pathogen genomes is limiting), LUCS is superior for achieving the high resolution needed for studies of such complex mixtures.",

Testing of LUCS with R10 chemistry is currently underway, and we are confident that our current error rate of 10-4 will be improved further. Of final note, long DNA molecules are highly prone to artificial recombination, or PCR jumping, during amplification. If left unaccounted for, PCR jumping fully compromises any attempts to sequence individual long molecules of DNA.

Read UMIs were clustered in python using a network-based approach, which leverages the repetitiveness of read UMIs and the linkage information between forward- and reverse-read UMIs. Chimeric clusters were pruned by removing read UMIs if metric longest common subsequence (LCS) exceeded 0.125 from the largest UMI in the cluster. This limit was chosen because it allows for no more three differences between read and centroid, in line with the expected error rate of ONT-based reads. Metric longest common subsequence is defined for two sequences, a and b, of length |a| and |b|, where:",

(A) Each individual DNA molecule in a complex mixture, bearing its own unique pattern of mutations (white), has a UMI applied to it via PCR (each UMI represented by a different end-color), which is specific for that molecule (Step 1). The pool of DNA molecules is then amplified and sequenced (Step 2), during which time artefacts (i.e., PCR errors and sequencing errors) are introduced in a random fashion across molecules (red). All reads are then clustered based on their UMI (Step 3), and a consensus read is built for each molecule (Step 4). This final step removes random errors introduced during the process (red) but retains true mutations (white) found in the original molecule and in all amplicons of that molecule. (B) Two-step PCR process for UMI application and dilution. In the first 4 cycles of PCR, the targeted DNA template is amplified by 125-bp oligonucleotide barcoding primers, each containing a random UMI sequence. The initial reaction is then diluted 25-fold within a larger PCR reaction containing only synthetic primers that amplify the UMI-containing molecules after 45 additional cycles of PCR. The resultant elimination of barcoding primer 're-priming' allows for high-resolution pair-end clustering and, in particular, the detection and removal of chimeras (artificial recombinant molecules) caused by PCR jumping.",
