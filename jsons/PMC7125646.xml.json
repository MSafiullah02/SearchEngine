            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae of non-segmented positive single-stranded RNA viruses, was discovered as the cause of a mystery swine disease in Europe (Lelystad virus, LV; Wensvoort et al., 1991) and in the U.S. (VR-2332; Collins et al., 1992). These two strains (VR-2332 and LV) are extremely diverse in nucleotide sequence (Meulenberg et al., 1993, Murtaugh et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999). Substantial sequence variation also occurs among North American PRRSV isolates (Kapur et al., 1996, Andreyev et al., 1997, Murtaugh et al., 1998) and such variation could be due to innate error rates of the RNA polymerase (Hubner et al., 1992, Ward et al., 1988) or PRRSV recombination (Kapur et al., 1996). The arterivirus family belongs to the order Nidovirales, along with coronaviruses and toroviruses (Cavanagh, 1997). Coronaviruses undergo high frequency viral recombination (Lai et al., 1985, Keck et al., 1988, Masters et al., 1994, Jia et al., 1995; reviewed in Lai, 1996) and toroviruses appear to have undergone non-homologous recombination events (Snijder, et al., 1991). Although putative recombination events among arteriviruses have been reported (Chirnside et al., 1994, Godeny et al., 1998), we provide the first experimental evidence that arteriviruses undergo homologous recombination.",

The infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C until the cytopathic effect (CPE) was greater than 80%, and then supernatants were harvested (1.3\u00d7107 TCID50/ml). MA-104 cells were infected with each virus alone or co-infected with R and S at a combined moi of 1.0, strain ratios (R:S) of 1:3, then incubated until CPE was complete (3 days p.i.). Plaque assays of the infected cell supernatants indicated that both plaque size and PFU/ml of the mixed infection viruses appeared similar to vaccine viruses alone (data not shown). Passage 1 media supernatants were used to reinfect MA-104 monolayers at an moi of 1.0 (passage 2) and the infection protocol was repeated twice more (passages 3 and 4). Viral RNA was isolated from each infected cell supernatant.",

            "text": "A comparison of RespPRRS\u00ae and of PRIME PAC\u00ae PRRS genomic sequence (GenBank submissions AF066183 and AF066384) identified strain specific regions. Differential primers (R9/, S9/, /R13, /S13) were synthesized to amplify a 1182 base region from nucleotides 12886\u201314067, encoding part of ORF 3 through ORF 5. The forward primers (R9/ and S9/) differed by eight bases and the reverse primers (/R13 and /S13) differed by six bases (Table 1\n). Total RNA was isolated from 280 \u03bcl infected cell supernatant containing infectious progeny virus using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (QIAgen Inc.). RNA templates (6 \u03bcl each) were each annealed to 2 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcM random hexamers and reverse transcribed using 2.5 units/\u03bcl Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) reverse transcriptase, 1 unit/\u03bcl RNase inhibitor and 1 mM each dNTP in 5 mM MgCl2/50 mM KCl/10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.3 at 42\u00b0C for 15 min (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). PCR amplification was completed on cDNAs from each infection using each forward primer paired with a homologous or heterologous reverse primer to screen for recombinant sequences. cDNA (5 \u03bcl) was added to 20 \u03bcl of mastermix such that the final component concentrations were 140 nM each primer, 200 \u03bcM each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2/50 mM KC1/10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.3 and 0.025 units AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Each sample was denatured at 94\u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles at 68\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s and 93\u00b0C for 45 s. Amplified fragments were polished at 72\u00b0C for 10 min and visualized on an agarose gel. Supernatants from cells infected only with R or S parent virus yielded product DNA only from homologous virus primer pairs (Fig. 1\nA, panels S and R). In contrast, supernatants from co-infected cells yielded DNA products from both heterologous and homologous primer pairs, indicating that the two vaccine viruses had recombined in the genomic region encoding ORF 3-5 (Fig. 1A, panel SRI). In order to exclude the possibility that this result occurred postharvest, due perhaps to enzymatic template switching, the individual vaccine viral RNAs from P1 cell supernatants were pooled and analyzed in the same RT-PCR experiment. In this case, as shown in Fig. 1A (panel S+R, lanes 2 and 3), heterologous primer pairs did not amplify recombinant bands. This result indicated that viral RNA recombination events occurred during co-culture of the parent viruses and were not artificially generated during RT-PCR amplification. To show that recombination resulted in packaged viral RNA, first passage supernatant from the co-culture was treated with RNase A before RNA isolation. The RNA was protected from RNAse A degradation and resulted in a similar RT-PCR pattern of recombination (Fig. 1B). Purified RNA added to culture supernatant was not similarly protected (data not shown), indicating that the supernatants contained RNases and that recombinant PCR products came only from packaged viral RNAs.",

Sequence analysis and comparison was completed with computer software included in the LASERGENE package (DNASTAR Inc.), Wisconsin Package Version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG)), and EUGENE (Molecular Biology Information Resource). Sequence analysis of five independent clones from the RS recombinant DNA product revealed five unique patterns of recombination within the 1182 bp region (Fig. 2). Clones RS136, RS131, RS135 and RS137 each appeared to represent a single and unique cross-over event (Fig. 2). Clone RS132 appeared to be a triple cross-over recombinant, as its sequence was 100% identical to parent strain R for the first 200 bases, 100% identical to parent strain S for the next 562 bases, 100% identical to strain R for 115 bases, then 100% identical to strain S for the remainder of the sequence. Recombination did not disrupt the encoded proteins. Three clones encoded chimeric ORF 3 proteins (RS132, RS135, RS137), three clones encoded chimeric ORF 4 proteins (RS131, RS132, RS136), and none of the clones resulted in a chimeric ORF 5 protein.",

At 25 cycles, the parental RNAs were readily detected in passage 1\u20133 supernatants, the RS product was barely detected, and almost no SR product was observed. Increasing the cycle number to 27 or 30 revealed that RS products were consistently more abundant than SR products in passages 1\u20133. However, at passage 4, only parental vaccine R product was detected in the supernatant. The relative ease with which recombinant RT-PCR bands were detected in passages 1-3 suggests a high frequency event and that recombinant viruses, especially RS recombinants, were continually produced and/or competed for growth with the parental vaccine strains. Passage 4 analysis revealed that strain R was better suited than either strain S or recombinant virus for continuous growth on MA-104 cells. Such a growth disparity also accounts for the inability to observe recombination after 1 passage at an R:S coinfection ratio of 1:1 (data not shown). The relative abundance of RS recombinants in passages 1\u20133 suggests that genomic sequences upstream of ORF 3 in parental strain R may be more adapted for in vitro growth. Analysis of passage 1 band densities at 25 and 27 cycles allowed an estimation of recombination frequencies. RS recombination occurred at a frequency of up to 10% of parent strain R whereas SR recombination was <2%, as the input vaccine strains had reached the plateau phase of PCR before recombinant products were visualized. The rates did not change dramatically with two additional passages. This cycle-dependent PCR-yield experiment was repeated two additional times, with no significant difference in the estimated recombination frequency obtained (data not shown). In addition, the frequencies reported may be low due to the fact that recombinations representing multiples of two would not be detected.",

            "text": "This report describes the first experimental data that arteriviruses produce recombinant viral sequences at a relatively high frequency and in the absence of selection. Coronaviruses undergo high frequency homologous recombination under selective pressure, at a rate of about 1% in 1300 nucleotides (Makino et al., 1986, Baric et al., 1990). The coronavirus frequency rate approximates the rate of recombination estimated for PRRSV in this report. We also obtained additional evidence that recombination is a biological mechanism to increase genetic diversity in PRRSV. The evidence of natural recombination between PRRSV field isolates and statistical data obtained previously (Kapur et al., 1996) lend support to the idea that recombination may contribute to the evolution of new PRRSV strains. Recombination in three (ORFs 3-5) of the four PRRSV glycoproteins indicate that sequence exchange is permitted within proteins and that recombination between two co-infecting strains may yield unique new virus variants. The frequency with which new recombinant forms become established in the environment may be low, since recombinants obtained in cell culture were unable to compete with parental cell culture-adapted strains over time and the isolation of plaque purified recombinant viruses has not been accomplished to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of new strains due to recombination clearly occurs in the avian coronavirus IBV (Cavanagh et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1994, Jia et al., 1995).",
