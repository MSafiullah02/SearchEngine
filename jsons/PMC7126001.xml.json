On the basis of our experience and to limit painful skin testing, we did not perform a first test at a lower concentration than 25 mg/mL. If a cephalosporin was incriminated, the work-up was completed with an intradermal skin test to the soluble form of the suspected drug if available (ie, ceftriaxone; Rocephin; Roche Pharma, Basle, Switzerland; and cefuroxime; Zinacef; GlaxoSmithKline; both at concentrations of 3 mg/mL).3 Skin test responses were assessed at 15 to 20 minutes. A wheal equal or superior than 3 mm in diameter in the absence of a wheal to the control solution (diluent; Diater) and in the presence of a positive response to histamine (skin prick test, 10 mg/mL) was defined as an immediate positive response. Patch test solutions were prepared by mixing the incriminated drug in petrolatum at a concentration of 5%.9 Negative controls were performed with petrolatum alone in each individual tested. All reagents were applied to uninvolved skin on the interscapular region of the patient's back by using acrylate adhesive strips with small plates attached for test allergens (IQ ultra chambers; Dormer Laboratories, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada).",

The rate of exanthema in viral infection is highly variable depending on the virus.13, 16 In our study, we screened for viruses most commonly known to be associated with a rash by using PCR and serologic analysis. The vast majority of children with a negative subsequent OCT tested positive for viral infection, mostly enteroviruses (picornavirus), at their initial visit. These viruses could be the cause of the index rash in some of these patients. Similar to nonimmediate allergic reactions, viral-induced exanthemas are immunologically mediated, with T cells playing a central role. However, major differences have been shown in the immunologic mechanism suspected.17 The negative viral screening results in patients with a subsequent negative OCT may be a result of limitations in testing technique or other infectious triggers, such as viruses not screened for, or bacterial infections.",

            "text": "An allergic reaction is a far more common cause for a rash after intake of a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic in adults than in children.4, 5 Reactions are referred to as drug allergy when immunologic mechanisms, either antibody-mediated or cell-mediated, can be demonstrated. By definition, these reactions are reproducible. In our study, this reproducibility was demonstrated in only a low proportion of patients (6.8%). Potentialization of a drug-related rash by the inflammatory reaction of an infection can certainly not be excluded. The pathogenesis of cutaneous drug reactions during viral infections may involve viral-induced polyclonal activation of lymphocytes, other reactions involving cellular immunity, or alterations of drug metabolism.18 EBV is the best known example of a viral risk factor for cutaneous drug reactions. Reactions in patients subsequently found to be infected with EBV are traditionally not considered to belong to drug allergies. An intriguing result of our study is that 3 of the 6 patients who had a positive OCT tested positive for an acute EBV infection. In these cases, the persistence of an EBV-induced inflammation could have favored the reaction induced by the OCT. It is also possible that EBV infections might change the pattern of reactivity to antibiotics, because persistent delayed-type reactions to amoxicillin, instead of the classic transient decrease in drug tolerance during EBV infection, have been reported.19 Although these conclusions are speculative, they should encourage further investigations in patients with amino-penicillin\u2013induced exanthema during EBV infection.",

We strongly emphasize that the patient's history is essential for confirming the diagnosis\u2014for example, by using the ENDA questionnaire.20 Although a recent study investigated diagnostic tests to differentiate between a viral and a drug-induced exanthema, no test has been validated so far.21 The analysis of the diagnostic value of common allergy tests (skin tests and specific IgE) was hampered by the surprisingly low number of patients with a positive OCT. Our study does show a good specificity (91.5%) for intradermal skin tests but a sensitivity of only 66.7%, a number slightly higher than previously reported.22 A low rate of reactions in skin test\u2013positive patients after re-exposure to the antibiotic has also been reported by others in a retrospective study.23 Current guidelines suggest that immediate reading of intradermal skin tests should be done only in immediate reactions suspected to be IgE-mediated.9 In our study, only 1 patient developed an immediate reaction. If immediate readings of intradermal tests were considered to predict only immediate reactions, the sensitivity would be even lower (16.7%), with a specificity of 87.8%. As in previous studies,24, 25 we found a very high negative predictive value for intradermal skin tests (97.4%).",

A recent study in patients with a history of a nonlife-threatening allergic reaction to penicillin showed that positive penicillin skin tests were not associated with a higher rate of positive OCT to penicillin than negative skin test results.25 These authors concluded that challenges should be performed only in patients in whom skin testing is not feasible. Our results suggest that we would have had to perform painful and time-consuming skin tests in 88 children to predict a positive challenge in only 4 patients. We demonstrate here that an OCT is the best diagnostic tool in benign skin rashes in children. A complete allergy work-up (skin tests, specific IgE measurement, followed or not by an OCT) is required only in patients with a history suggesting anaphylaxis. Our protocol included a 2-step OCT to reduce the risk of an immediate, potentially severe allergic reaction in patients with positive skin tests. However, none of these patients developed an immediate and/or a severe reaction. Thus, a 1-dose OCT in patients with a history of a benign reaction can be considered safe. In the meantime, we have challenged more than 150 children in our referral clinic with the 1-dose protocol, followed by a 30-minute observation, without any significant reactions. Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that this procedure requires careful primary evaluation by an experienced allergist and cannot be performed in patients suspected of a more severe reaction.",
