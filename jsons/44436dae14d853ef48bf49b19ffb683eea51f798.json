Fears have been raised that the need for infectious diseases consultation and management will be curtailed because we provide cognitive services that are not perceived as being needed in a health system filled with intensivists, hospitalists, and skilled nursing facility physicians. Now is the time for us to reframe our role in the health system that is evolving to a process of care focused on population health and patient safety that pays providers for value they bring to achieve those goals. Specific suggestions are made to enhance the infectious diseases physician's profile with the intent of encouraging debate, discussion, and action.",

Friends, mentors, partners, and leaders in the infectious diseases (ID) community, reflecting on these concerns, worry about our collective future, our viability, and our prestige. Others cite the woeful state of our fellowship match rate as further evidence of decline and wonder aloud, \"Is this the death of the specialty?\" As a result, the specialty of ID and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are going through a time of reassessment and self-reflection. I am hopeful that through this process we will come to realize that, far from dying or being elective in nature, ID is poised for amazing growth, high demand, and even mandatory utilization. Almost 30 years ago, Petersdorf made the statement that we are training so many ID clinicians that we will be culturing each other [1] . That never came to pass. Rather than being in decline, ID is even more vibrant, needed, and valuable. I strongly believe that we are entering a golden era for the ID clinician. To paraphrase Warren Buffet, we should be cautious when others are overly optimistic and be greedy when others are cautious. Now is the time to take advantage of the opportunity before us, but we must reframe the perspective on our role to solidify our value and position in the healthcare system of the future. With this mindset, I will explore our current circumstance and provide some reflections on how we may address this challenge.",

A patient was in the hospital for almost a week with a fever of unknown origin (FUO). FUO can be one of the most challenging diagnoses in which to identify an etiology, and this case seemed no different. Empiric antimicrobial therapy had failed to eliminate the fever, so the patient was admitted by his primary physician. He underwent the FUO workup so common in today's medical centers: cultures of blood and urine; innumerable blood tests; computed tomographic scans of head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and consultations with several specialists. During my evaluation, I asked him how he was doing. He said his elbow was sore. I asked, \"Do any other joints bother you?\" He replied, \"Yes, as a matter of fact-my foot is sore, too.\" Indeed, his olecranon bursa was moderately swollen and warm but not red, as was his right great toe. Aspiration of the bursa identified uric acid crystals, and prednisone \"cured\" his FUO. His $20 000 admission could have either been limited or avoided with prompt evaluation.",

There was mild surrounding cellulitis but no eye pain, no impingement of eye movement, and no significant swelling around the eye. There were no visual changes, no headache, and no central nervous system complaints. The diagnosis of a staphylococcal furuncle with spontaneous drainage was clear.

Although the consultation was ordered to manage antibiotic therapy (\"call the 'antibiotic doc'\"), this case was anything but antibiotic management. The IDP is not an organ-based specialist and looks and evaluates each body system equally. The joints get as much attention as the heart, lungs, and abdomen. How often is the IDP called after numerous antibiotic trials, many tests, and no clear diagnosis only to find that no one palpated the neck and thus a tender thyroid in a coughing patient with persistent fever was missed, or no one removed an old intravenous line or recognized the mild liver function test abnormalities and palpable spleen of an atypical Epstein-Barr virus infection? We are not \"antibiotic doctors\" but rather master diagnosticians who listen, look, and apply treatments judiciously. In the evolving healthcare delivery models of integrated delivery networks, medical homes, and accountable care, our value can be compelling and far-reaching.",

The patient had a simple staphylococcal skin abscess, albeit in an inopportune location. The mild periorbital edema was a consequence of the taut skin on the forehead, which caused dependent migration of edema from the local infection into the eye socket. It had nothing to do with the presence or absence of orbital cellulitis. Understanding the nature of the response of body tissue to infection, the etiology of orbital cellulitis, and the role of diagnostic tests allowed the IDP to help the patient and the caregivers limit cost and inconvenience and to let the patient to be treated at home. This understanding of ID pathophysiology allows us to pick the right tests, the right venue for care, and the right therapy that will achieve the best outcome at the lowest cost.",

What is simple to us because of our background and training is of great value to our patients and the healthcare system.

Policy and political leaders debate and discuss our nation's response to them. Hollywood has produced innumerable movies about contagious diseases (eg, Contagion, The Andromeda Strain, Outbreak) that play on the public's fear about transmissible diseases. Other than IDPs, no other group of medical specialists has the authority to help society address these concerns with clear insight, strong science, professionalism, and expertise.

Furthermore, we are needed for early diagnosis, to institute early directed treatment, to achieve early resolution of disease states, to limit hospital stay, to reduce the risk of disease transmission, to reduce the use of expensive tests, and to provide reassurance and understanding. It is this leadership, understanding, and insight that distinguish the IDP from the pharmacist on the stewardship committee, from the infection control practitioner, from the hospitalist or the intensivist. Rather than feeling threatened by these professionals, we must embrace their roles to help us lead. Our number one job has to be to start with these principles.

In a fee-for-service model, these activities reduce revenue or income for the ID service, resulting in one of the lowest fair-market values of any physician. Despite that, we have pursued those activities fervently for decades. However, if one looks at the combined costs for the 5 highest ID admissions, they are more costly to our health system than cardiovascular disease [6, 7] . Furthermore, a number of the \"never events\" listed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which are not reimbursable, are infection-related events [8] .
