Although the initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is also possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and then infected patient 1 during her incubation period.

Both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\u2013CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [14, 15]. Therefore, individuals in close contact with symptomatic patients with SARS should be isolated for medical observation. However, human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate 2019-nCoV, which was declared to be the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans, different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [6]. The nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from all 4 patients were 2019-nCoV positive in our study, indicating that 2019-nCoV can infect the upper respiratory tract. According to the National Health Commission\u2019s guideline for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCov, isolation and in vitro cultures showed that 2019-nCov can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours [16]. These results support the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is more infectious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as it is easily discharged through the respiratory tract.",

Here are our recommendations. First, the epidemiological exposure history should be taken as the most important reference for judging the potential source of infection, and isolation and protection measures should be further strengthened for the relevant persons with clear risk factors for exposure history. Second, the determination of close contacts should also include those who are exposed to case patients during their incubation. Third, research into and development of a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic reagent for 2019-nCoV should be accelerated, to facilitate the screening of infected persons among clinical and close contacts. Fourth, health education should be further strengthened, and protective equipment should be properly used to reduce the exposure to 2019-nCoV. Finally, if possible, the isolation and medical observation of close contacts should be centralized under the premise of the safely transport, such as masks, single-person transfer and transport vehicle disinfection, et al. It is important to establish a community supervision mechanism when home isolation and observation are needed.",
