To determine the extent to which mRNA decay-induced Pol II 134 repression is dependent on Xrn1, we measured Pol II occupancy by ChIPseq in mock and 135 MHV68 infected cells upon depletion of Xrn1 using siRNA (Fig 2A) . Remarkably, knockdown 136 of Xrn1 resulted in a near complete recovery of Pol II promoter occupancy in MC57G cells 137 infected with WT MHV68 (Fig 2B, Supp Fig 2A) . We validated these findings using 138 independent biological replicates at Rplp0 and Fus by ChIP qPCR (Fig 2C) . On a gene-by-gene 139 basis, we observed similar levels of Pol II at promoters in mock and infected cells depleted of 140 Xrn1 ( Fig 2D, Supp Fig 2B) .

            "text": "241This protection is lost upon relocation of the viral promoters into the host genome or when the 242 viral genome is in a latent state, emphasizing the importance of DNA context and replication 243 state, rather than promoter sequence, in determining the transcriptional response to accelerated 244 mRNA decay. 245Across the host genome, Pol II occupancy appears to be most strongly affected at the 246 stage of recruitment. The reduction in promoter-proximal Pol II is propagated into the gene body, 247 although the differences there were less pronounced, suggesting that once transcription of a gene 248 initiates there are not subsequent blocks to elongation. This agrees with prior studies of 249 individual host loci in MHV68 infected or muSOX expressing cells; 250Gilbertson et al. 2018). We also did not observe a defect in transcription termination, or evidence 251 of polymerases on the DNA after TSSs, suggesting that the gammaherpesvirus MHV68 does not 252 induce the termination defect and run-on transcription of host genes recently described in HSV-1 253(Rutkowski et al. 2015). 254Two pieces of evidence indicate that reduction of Pol II at host genes is unlikely due to 255 sequestration of or competition for the transcription machinery by the viral DNA. First, infection 256 with the mRNA decay mutant virus R443I, which replicates its viral genome to WT levels 257(Richner et al. 2011), does not induce the widespread reduction in Pol II recruitment to host 258 promoters. Second, transfection of muSOX alone (or other broad acting viral endonucleases) in 259 the absence of viral infection is sufficient to induce transcriptional repression at host promoters. 260 Therefore, we instead favor the hypothesis that one or more cellular proteins released from 261 degrading mRNA fragments triggers a signaling event that restricts transcription machinery 262 occupancy of mammalian chromatin(Gilbertson et al. 2018). 263Reduced Pol II occupancy of the host genome during MHV68 infection parallels 264 infection data from the alphaherpesvirus HSV-1. HSV-1 infection results in a genome-wide 265 reduction in Pol II occupancy of host chromatin and reduced nascent RNA production of the 266 majority of host transcripts(Rutkowski et al. 2015;Abrisch et al. 2016;Spencer et al. 1997). 267 Furthermore, early data showed that while the endogenous mouse \u03b2-globin locus was 268 transcriptionally repressed during HSV-1 infection, its expression was rescued upon integration 269 of the \u03b2-globin gene into the HSV-1 genome(Smiley et al. 1987;Smibert & Smiley 1990). 270 Experiments with gene-specific null viruses have implicated immediate early (IE) proteins in the 271 HSV-1 transcriptional repression phenotype, including ICP27, which can accelerate mRNA 272 turnover (Spencer et al. 1997; Smiley 2004). Additionally, we have previously published, and 273 confirm in this report, that transfection of HSV-1 vhs, another broad acting endoribonuclease, is 274 sufficient to induce reduced Pol II occupancy of several host promoters (Abernathy et al. 275 2015).Thus, in addition to targeting host and viral mRNAs for cytoplasmic decay, both alpha and 276 gammaherpesviruses restrict Pol II occupancy of the host genome, although additional work is 277 needed to establish whether the underlying mechanism is similar. 278 During the lytic stage of herpesvirus infection, viral DNA is localized to replication 279 compartments. These non-membrane bound structures are sites of viral genome replication, 280 transcription, and packaging (Schmid et al. 2014).They are enriched for many host and viral 281 proteins involved in these processes, including chromatin modifying factors and Pol II 282 (Dembowski & DeLuca 2015; Rice et al. 1994; Li et al. 2018). Replication compartments grow 283 and coalesce over infection, excluding host chromatin, which becomes pushed to the nuclear 284 periphery (Chang et al. n.d.; Taylor et al. 2003; Monier et al. 2000). We recently showed that 285 muSOX and Xrn1-coordinated mRNA decay causes differential trafficking of many cellular 286 RNA binding proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Gilbertson et al. 2018). Knockdown 287 and overexpression studies suggested that at least one of these proteins, PABPC, is associated 288 with transcriptional repression. Here, we detected PABPC in viral replication compartments of 289 infected cell nuclei, indicating that selective exclusion of PABPC from these compartments is290 not the mechanism by which the viral genome escapes repression. Instead, we hypothesize that 291 either the state of viral DNA or other protective features of the replication compartment confers 292 escape from transcriptional repression. 293 Protection from mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression was not conferred to 294 host or viral promoters present on the latent viral episome, indicating that lytic phase viral DNA 295 replication or replication compartment formation is key to this phenotype. The latent genomes of 296 gammaherpesviruses including KSHV and Epstein Bar Virus (EBV) are heavily methylated and 297 histone-rich, with the exception of promoters of genes expressed during latency, the latent origin 298 of replication, and CTCF binding sites (G\u00fcnther & Grundhoff 2010; Szyf et al. 1985; Hilton et 299 al. 2013). Notably, during latency key lytic promoters like RTA contain both the activating 300 H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 histone marks, representing a 'poised' state (Toth et al. 301 2010). Rapid changes shortly after lytic cycle induction result in hypomethylation and removal 302 of repressive marks at early gene promoters(G\u00fcnther & Grundhoff 2010; Toth et al. 2010) .At 303 later stages of infection, KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 genomes have been shown to be largely 304 nucleosome free, consistent with histones not being packaged in virions (Dembowski & DeLuca 305 2015; Monier et al. 2000; Hollingworth et al. 2017). For gammaherpesviruses, this is the stage at 306 which mRNA degradation is most pronounced. We therefore hypothesize that the 'open' state of 307 viral DNA during lytic replication plays an important role in facilitating Pol II recruitment under 308 conditions of accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay. Future work is geared towards exploring 309 whether widespread mRNA decay alters cellular chromatin states and DNA accessibility and, if 310 so, how this influences transcription factor recruitment. 311In conclusion, decay-coupled transcriptional repression is a novel facet of viral 312 manipulation of the cellular gene expression landscape. We hypothesize that the ability to escape 313 from transcriptional repression is linked to the open conformation of viral DNA in replication 314 compartments, and that this helps these viruses counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss. 315While widespread mRNA decay has been shown to facilitate immune evasion, gene expression 316 control, and latency establishment, the robust viral transcription we document here presents a 317 parsimonious explanation for a novel way in which the virus benefits from accelerated decay. and VHS and SOX have been previously published. 323 pCDEF3-GFP was used as a control. 324Primers used for qPCR and for cloning are listed in SuppTable 2. M7 and M4-puro were 325 made by cloning the respective promoter sequence upstream of the puromycin cassette in a 326 pLKO-sgRNA vector. The promoter of M4 was defined as the 1131bp upstream of the M4 327 coding region not overlapping with other viral ORFs and the promoter sequence of M7 was 328 previously published (Wong-Ho et al. 2014). pGL3-kLANA-puromycin was made by 329 introducing the puromycin gene into the I-CeuI and XbaI sites of pGL3-kLANA via InFusion 330 (Clonetech) cloning. pGL3-kLANA was made by amplifying KSHV's LANA promoter 331 sequence (Jeong et al. 2001)and using InFusion cloning to introduce it into the XhoI and HindIII 332 sites of pGL3. pGL3-CMV was similarly made by introducing the amplified CMV promoter fibroblast cells (ATCC), 293T cells (ATCC) and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) 337 were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 338 iSLK BAC16 cells (Brulois et al. 2012) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% 339 FBS and 1mg/mL hygromycin B. To reactivate iSLK cells, they were treated with 1ug/mL 340 doxycycline and 1mM sodium butyrate for 48h. 341 DNA transfections were carried out in 293T cells at 70-90% confluency in 10 cm plates 342 with 10 \u03bcg host-shutoff factor plasmid or vector control using PolyJet (SignaGen) 24h before 343 harvesting and again at 18h before harvesting. 344 Lentiviral transduction was carried out by spinfecting 1x10 6 293T or MC57G cells with 345 lentivirus made from 2 nd generation plasmids at a MOI <1 for 2h with 4ug/mL polybrene 346 (Fisher). Twenty-four hours later puromycin (1 \u03bcg/ml for 293T or 3 \u03bcg/ml for MC57G) was 347 added to select for transduced cells. 293T cells stably expressing the kLANA-puromycin 348 cassette were made by transfecting the cells with 1 \u03bcg pGL3-kLANA-puromycin using PolyJet, 349 then selecting with puromycin for random integration events. 350 For the CMV-luciferase promoter assay, populations of 293T cells expressing muSOX 351 were selected 24h post-transfection using the Miltenyi Biotec MACS cell separation system 352 according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (Gilbertson et al. incubated in suspension with 500 \u03bcM 4SU (Sigma T4509) in DMEM 362 supplemented with 10% FBS for 10 min then washed with PBS. RNA was extracted with TRIzol 363 followed by isopropanol purification. RNA (300 ug) was incubated in biotinylation buffer (50 364 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 5 mM EDTA) and 5ug MTSEA-biotin (Biotium #90066), rotating at room 365 temperature in the dark for 30m. A no biotin control was made from an equal amount of total 366 RNA and incubated as above but without the addition of MTSEA-biotin. RNA was then 367 phenol:chloroform extracted and precipitated with isopropanol. The pellet was resuspended in 368 DEPC-treated water and mixed with 50 uL Dynabeads MyOne streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen) that 369 had been pre-washed twice with wash buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 370 0.1% Tween 20). Samples were rotated in the dark for 1hr at room temperature, then washed 371 twice with 65\u00b0C wash buffer and twice with room temperature wash buffer. Samples were eluted 372 twice with 100uL 5% Beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) in DEPC H 2 0 for 5m then RNA was 373 precipitated with isopropanol and quantified by RT-qPCR. 374 Viral mutagenesis, propagation and infections 375 The WT and R443I MHV68 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) were previously 376 described (Adler et al. 2000; Richner et al. 2011). MHV68 was produced by first making p0 377 virus by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells in 6-well plates with 2.5 \u03bcg BAC DNA using TransIT-X2 378 (Mirus Bio) for 24h. Five to seven days later, the cells were split into a 10 cm dish, then 379 harvested and frozen. After 5-7 days the majority of cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE). 30 \u03bcL 380 of p0 was then added per confluent 10 cm dish of NIH 3T12 cells, split 2 days later into four 10 381 cm dishes and harvested 4-6 days later when all cells were infected. Cells were collected by 382 centrifugation (5 min, 1500 rpm) and the pellet was dounced 10 times. The cell pellet and 383 supernatant were then ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 30,000 rpm. The resulting pellet was 384 resuspended and titered by plaque assay. Cells were infected with MHV68 at an MOI of , 0.5% NP-40, cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) and then clarified 390 by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u02daC. Whole cell lysate was quantified by Bradford 391 assay and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies for western blot are: Xrn1 (Bethyl A300reverse transcribed using AMV RT (Promega) with random 9-mer primers. 396 Total RNA was DNase treated with TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher) or DNase treated on column 397 with Zymo Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus DNase. cDNA was quantified using iTaq Universal 398 SYBR Mastermix (BioRad) and transcript-specific primers. All qPCR results are normalized to 399 18S levels and WT or vector control set to 1. 400 401 Immunofluoresence 402 NIH 3T3 cells were plated on coverslips (7.5 x 10 4 cells/well of a 12-well), infected the 403 following day for 25-27 h, and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. iSLK-Bac16 cells 404 were plated on coverslips (5 x 10 4 cells/well of a 12-well), reactivated 24h later with doxycycline 405 and sodium butyrate for 48 hours and then fixed as above. Cells were permeabilized with ice-406 cold methanol at -20\u00b0C for at least 20 min and incubated with anti-Pol II antibody (Biolegend, 407 8WG16 at 1:200), anti-PABPC antibody (Abcam ab21060 at 1:200 for mouse cells and Santa 408 Cruz sc32318 at 1:25 for human cells) or anti-ORF59 antibody (Advanced Biotechnologies 13-409 211-100 at 1:200) in 5% BSA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies were added (1:1000) for 1 410 h at 37 \u00b0C. Coverslips were mounted in DAPI-containing Vectashield (VectorLabs). We 411 identified RCs by DAPI exclusion and Pol II recruitment or ORF59 staining (Rice et al. 1994; 412 Dai-Ju et al. 2006; Li et al. 2018). Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 710 AxioObserver 413 with a 40x oil objective. Cells with RCs were first identified, then PABPC co-localization was 414 determined by counting cells with at least 2x nuclear pixel intensity relative to nonperformed from 15 cm plates of cells. 3 x 10 6 MC57G or 293T cells were 419 plated 24 h before infection and then harvested 24 h after infection or transfection(s). Upon 420 harvesting, cells were washed with PBS, crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature 421 for 10 min. Cells were quenched in 0.125 M glycine for 5 min and washed twice with cold PBS. 422 Crosslinked cell pellets were mixed with 1 mL fractionation buffer (5mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85mM 423 KCl, 0.5% NP-40 with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) and incubated on ice 424 for 10 min, during which time the lysate was dounce homogenized to release nuclei and spun at 425 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to pellet nuclei. Nuclei were then resuspended in 300 ul of nuclei 426 lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.3% SDS, 10mM EDTA, with cOmplete EDTA-free 427 Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) and rotated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C followed by sonication using a 428 QSonica Ultrasonicator. Sonicated chromatin was then spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and 429 the pellet discarded. 40ug of chromatin was brought to 500uL with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 430 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl and cOmplete EDTA-431 free Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) and incubated with 10 ug mouse monoclonal anti-RNAPII 432 (BioLegend, 8WG16) or rabbit IgG (Fisher Scientific) overnight, whereupon samples were 433 rotated with 20 ul protein G dynabeads (Thermofisher) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed with 434 low salt immune complex (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% Triton-x-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 435 0.1% SDS), high salt immune complex (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% Triton-x-100, 2 mM EDTA, 436 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS), lithium chloride immune complex (10mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 437 1% NP-40, 1% Deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA), and Tris-EDTA for 5 min each at 4\u00b0C with 438 rotation. DNA was eluted from the beads using 100 ul of elution buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 ug/ml 439 Proteinase K) and incubated at 55\u00b0C for 2h, then 65\u00b0C for 12h. DNA was purified using a Zymo 440 Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit, and quantified by qPCR using primers to the promoter regions 441 of indicated genes for 50 cycles. qPCR was simultaneously performed on input chromatin reads in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), tdf files were made from 451 bam files and indexes made from those bam files. To make tdf files for the viral genome, a 452 chrom.size file was created for MHV68 and then the count command was run. Analysis of 453 mapped reads was performed with HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif 454 EnRichment) (Heinz et al. 2010). Tag directories were created from the bam files generated from 455 Bowtie with the makeTagDirectory command. This was done separately for the mouse and 456 MHV68 genomes. For mouse genes, the analyzeRepeats command was used to look at tag 457 density in the body of genes and the -c pausing option was used to compare pausing ratios. 458 annotatePeaks was run in both the -hist and -ghist mode to assess composite Pol II occupancy 459 across the mouse genome as well as individual gene occupancy. 460 Viral analyses were done by first creating a custom genome annotation in HOMER using 461 the loadGenome command. The TSS file was created from data generously shared by Scott 462 Tibbetts. annotatePeaks was run in the -hist mode to assess composite Pol II occupancy across 463 the viral genome as well as individual gene occupancy. 464 Promoter-proximal Pol II recruitment to mammalian genes is RNA-decay dependent 479 (A) Pol II ChIP-seq signal profiles of host genes in mock-infected, MHV68-infected and R443I-480 infected cells. Each row of the heat map displays Pol II occupancy of one gene from -1000 to 481 +1000 in 25bp bins. Genes are ranked by the Pol II-transcription start site (TSS) proximal signal 482 in mock infected cells. (B) ChIP-qPCR validation of Pol II occupancy at the Rplp0 and Fus 483 promoters. Pol II ChIP was performed on mock, MHV68 WT or MHV68 R443I cells and Pol II 484 levels were assayed near the TSS of two repressed host genes during MHV68 infection from the 485 ChIP-seq data. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, students t-test) (C) Sequence tags were binned into 25-486 bp bins for -2000 to +4000 around the TSS.

Similarly, comparing the amount of Pol II in gene bodies and at TTS of 142 Xrn1-depleted cells (as described in Fig 1) showed little difference between mock and MHV68 143 infected conditions (Figs 2F, 2G, Supp Fig 2C). Together, these data highlight the essentiality of 144 Xrn1 for the genome-wide repression of Pol II occupancy during virus-induced mRNA decay. 145 Pol II recruitment to viral genes is not affected by RNA decay 147 Herpesviral genes are transcribed in the nucleus by mammalian Pol II, and thus could be 148 similarly subjected to the mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression observed across the 149 host genome. We therefore analyzed Pol II occupancy of the viral genome in WT MHV68 and 150 R443I infected cells to determine how viral genes respond to RNA decay. The average Pol II 151 signature across 82 viral ORFs between -500 and +500 basepairs (bp) around the TSS (O'Grady 152 et al., manuscript in preparation) was comparable in cells infected with WT or R443I MHV68, 153",

We hypothesize that pervasive transcription of the viral 161 genome at 24 hpi, compounded by the presence of TSSs on both Watson and Crick strands, 162 likely contributes to this phenotype. 163 PABPC is not excluded from viral replication compartments 165 We next considered how the viral genome maintains high levels of Pol II occupancy 166 during accelerated mRNA decay. During replication, viral DNA is transcribed within viral 167 replication compartments (RCs) in the nucleus, which exclude host DNA and thus stain poorly 168 with DAPI (Chang et al. n.d.; Taylor et al. 2003; Monier et al. 2000). Although they are not 169 membrane bound, these compartments selectively enrich for factors required for viral replication 170 (such as the viral processivity factor ORF59) and gene expression (such as Pol II) (Li et al. 2018; 171 Dembowski & DeLuca 2015; Rice et al. 1994). Virus-induced mRNA decay causes increased 172 trafficking of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, 173 which we have recently linked to transcriptional repression (Kumar et al. 2011; Gilbertson et al. 174 2018). To determine whether replication compartments selectively exclude nuclear PABPC as a 175 means of avoiding transcriptional repression, we monitored its localization in cells lytically 176 infected with MHV68 or KSHV. As expected, the majority of infected cells displayed increased 177nuclear PABPC compared to unreactivated or uninfected cells as measured by 178 immunofluorescence (IF). We further saw that PABPC was not excluded from replication 179 compartments(Fig. 4A, B, Supp Fig 3A). To determine PABPC localization relative to RCs, we 180 first identified cells with RCs by looking for regions of Pol II or ORF59 staining that excluded 181 DAPI. We then quantified nuclear PABPC pixel intensity, and counted cells as having an 182 overlapping RC/PABPC signal when the PABPC pixel intensity was at least 2x that of cells 183 without nuclear PABPC from the same image. Indeed, 85 percent of MHV68 infected cells 184 showed overlapping PABPC/Pol II signal and 90 percent of reactivated iSLKs showed an 185 overlapping PABPC/ORF59 signal(Fig 4C). Thus, PABPC exclusion from RCs is unlikely to 186 Viral promoters fail to escape transcriptional repression outside of the viral genome 189",
