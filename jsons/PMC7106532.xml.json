            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first detected in a single patient with severe respiratory tract infection in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Evidence of spreading was provided by virus detection in a second patient from Qatar treated for similar symptoms in the United Kingdom [1], [2]. Since then an increasing number of cases, including more than 80 fatal cases have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. All human cases were linked to the Middle East region but imported cases were also detected in Europe and Africa [4], [5]. Virus detection in the majority of cases was done using specific real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays in samples from the lower respiratory tract. Samples from the upper respiratory tract have been used for the investigation of mild cases and contacts, despite lower virus concentrations in these materials [6], [7], [8], [9]. Two rRT-PCR assays previously published by our group [10], [11] are recommended by the WHO for MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics [12]. These assays target genomic regions upstream of the Envelope gene (upE) and in the viral open reading frame 1A (ORF1A). Both assays proved to be highly sensitive and were successfully used for the identification of the majority of the diagnosed MERS cases. Based on the upE and ORF1A assays, real-time RT-PCR assays using the same oligonucleotides were developed into ready-to-use reagent formulations available as a test kit.",

Briefly, 12.5 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 reaction buffer (SuperScript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), 1 \u03bcl of enzyme mixture, additional 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.4 \u03bcM of primer ORF1A-Fwd (CCACTACTCCCATTTCGTCAG) and 0.4 \u03bcM of primer ORF1A-Rev (CAGTATGTGTAGTGCGCATATAAGCA) and 0.2 \u03bcM of probe ORF1A-P (FAM-TTGCAAATTGGCTTGCCCCCACT-TAMRA) were mixed. Five \u03bcl of RNA and nuclease free-water were added up to a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl. Thermal cycling was performed at 55 \u00b0C for 20 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 3 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s. Reaction conditions were the same for the upE RT-PCR but using the following primer and probe sequences: upE-Fwd (GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT), upE-Rev (GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA), upE-P (FAM-CTCTTCACATAATCGCCCCGAGCTCG-TAMRA). The test kit versions of the upE and ORF1A rRT-PCR assays are based on the same oligonucleotides and are both included in the RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). They have a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl with 10 \u03bcl of sample RNA input. During the RNA-extraction, the target for the internal amplification control (IC) is added to check for PCR inhibition or loss of RNA during the extraction procedure. Alternatively the IC could also be used as a RT-PCR inhibition control only, by adding the IC into the PCR reaction. The IC is an in vitro transcribed RNA with an artificial sequence, targeted by additional primers and an additional probe included in the PCR mix. Two different real-time PCR instruments were used, the LC480II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA-extraction was performed using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). If not specified, 140 \u03bcl of sample were used and the RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcl of AVE buffer (QIAGEN).",

Conversely, the availability of two different detection targets included in the kit is of great utility in positive cases, whereby a first step into confirmatory testing is achieved through results from the second target gene [12]. As long as MERS-CoV infection is a rare clinical entity [14], [15], [16], however, diagnostic confirmation should never rely on results from one test alone, and the possibility of general errors on laboratory level should be considered [12], [17]. For the time being, clinical samples from cases with positive initial results should be forwarded to reference laboratories in order to achieve confirmation and to provide reference materials for a severe but rare infection.",

An alignment of 26 new sequences targeted by the 1A assay showed no mismatch within primer- and probe binding sites. Among the 24 new sequences for the upE target region, two sequences showed single nucleotide mismatches, including one at the second position of the upE forward-primer in the Wadi-Ad-Dawasir_1_2013 sequence (GenBank no. KJ156881) and another at the second position of the upE-Probe in the Riyadh_13b_2013 sequence (GenBank no. KJ156873). We have generated an in vitro-transcribed RNA containing both mismatches and encountered no loss of sensitivity using both the in-house as well as the kit-based formulation of the upE assay.",
