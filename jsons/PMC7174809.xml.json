It will not be a question of scotomizing important areas of medicine, but a return to its origins. The extreme fragmentation of the healthcare offers to citizens changes its priorities, and bringing together apparently distant disciplines [4]. The powerful investments that all nations are making by transforming their hospitals will not and must not be nullified but converted into large multidisciplinary departments.",
