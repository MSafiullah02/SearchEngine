            "text": "Over the last few decades, the importance of bats (order Chiroptera) in the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic diseases has become increasingly evident; bats are thought to harbor the most zoonotic agents per species [1]. The list of pathogens that infect bats includes the major mammalian paramyxoviruses [2], coronaviruses [3], [4], filoviruses [5], [6], [7], distinct influenza lineages [8], [9], hepadnaviruses [10], and hantaviruses [11], as well as lyssaviruses such as rabies virus [12], [13]. In the United States, bats are often the most common source of rabies infections in humans [14], and in Central and South America, rabies transmitted by vampire bats is a serious zoonotic and economic issue [15]. This association between bats and pathogens that significantly impacts human populations has increased public fear and misunderstanding of these animals and lead to culling campaigns [15], [16], [17], [18]. Unfortunately, culling campaigns often lead to the death of valuable non-target bat species [16] and appear ineffective in reducing disease incidence [17]. Alternatively, vaccination of other wildlife species has been successful in mitigating the public health impact of rabies with the development of efficient and practical distribution methods for mass immunization.",

            "text": "Poxviral vectors have been used extensively for oral vaccines to control infectious diseases in a variety of animal species over the last 25 years [19], [20]. Several advantages of poxviruses as vaccine vectors include: (1) their allowance of large insertions of foreign DNA; (2) ease of manufacturing; (3) thermal and genetic stability; (4) safety and infectivity for multiple target species; and (5) ability to infect via mucosal and dermal routes. For example, an oral rabies vaccine, constructed by inserting the rabies G glycoprotein into vaccinia virus and distributed via baits, has been used for many years to curtail rabies outbreaks in foxes, raccoons and other animals in North America and Europe [21]. Previous studies assessing a vaccinia-based rabies vaccine (VR-G) in Desmodus bats demonstrated the protective efficacy of that construct [22], [23], [24]. However, this vector has undesirable side-effects, especially in immunocompromised individuals [25], necessitating the development of attenuated virus strains. More recently, an oral sylvatic plague vaccine using another poxvirus (raccoon pox, RCN) was shown to protect prairie dogs and is currently being tested in large-scale field trials [26], [27]. RCN was first isolated from the upper respiratory tract of apparently healthy raccoons in North America [28]. It has since been shown to be safe and effective in a variety of species, including domestic cats, piglets, dogs, raccoons, skunks, foxes, bobcats, rabbits, sheep, prairie dogs, non-human primates, and chickens, with none of the immunized animals showing clinical side effects [29], [30], [31], [32]. Additionally, RCN has been shown to be immunogenic via non-parenteral routes in both domestic species [29] and free ranging wildlife [33], [34]. Another orthopoxvirus vector, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), is a highly attenuated form of vaccinia [35], [36] and has also been demonstrated to safely and effectively induce immunity [37], [38].",

Four bats from each group were given 109 plaque forming units (PFU) in 100 \u03bcl of either RCN-luc or MVA-luc by intramuscular (IM) injection, split into two 50 \u03bcl volumes injected into each thigh muscle. The remaining four bats in each group were given the same amount of virus in 70 \u03bcl sterile saline; using a micropipette with sterile tips, the volume split among the nostrils (10 \u03bcl given each nare) and mouth (50 \u03bcl) for oronasal (ON) exposure. Bats were monitored for 3 h post inoculation for signs of adverse effects. Animals were scanned using an IVIS 200 Biophotonic imager (PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA, USA) at one-day post infection (dpi) and every-other day thereafter until 2 consecutive images with less than 100 radiance units (comparable to background) were observed. Bats were scanned prior to infection and confirmed to have no auto-luminescence beyond background levels. Imaging was conducted at roughly the same time period each day, midway through the bats\u2019 active period. On imaging days the bats were separated individually into paper lunch bags, weighed, and injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with d-luciferin (Potassium-Luciferin, Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO 63132, dose: 150 mg/kg) at 14 min prior to imaging the ON group and 26 min prior to imaging the IM group, which were empirically determined to be the time of peak luminescence post substrate exposure on the first day of imaging. All bats were examined for signs of disease or discomfort at the time of substrate injection. For imaging, animals were anesthetized by chamber-delivered isoflurane and positioned in the imager in dorsal recumbency with wings extended laterally, where they were maintained on mask-delivered isoflurane. After imaging the anesthesia was ceased, bats were monitored and given thermal support during recovery. After 11 dpi the bats with remaining detectable luminescence were imaged every 3 days until luminescence was below detectable levels. Images were collected and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, California, USA).

All samples were quickly stored at -80 \u00b0C until testing. Prior to testing, 100 \u03bcl DMEM media was added to fecal samples, vortexed thoroughly and sonicated four times in a bath sonicator for 15 s. DNA was extracted from 40 \u03bcl of the samples using the Zymo Quick-gDNA\u2122 MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA 92614, U.S.A.), and a PCR assay was run to assess for presence of the inoculated virus. PCR was performed with OneTaq\u00ae Quick-Load\u00ae 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA 01938, USA) and primers targeting the luc insert flanks [Supplemental info]. The limit of detection for this PCR protocol was determined to be 0.125 picograms of DNA, or 6.8x104 copies, as determined by serial dilution of a known quantity of viral DNA. Any samples positive by PCR were then assessed for levels of live virus by determining the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). For RCN-luc samples, positive wells were assessed by plaque observation, and the TCID50 was calculated and used to approximate plaque forming units (PFU)/ml by the Spearman & K\u00e4rber algorithm [41].

Due to minimal sample volume left, no smaller dilutions were possible. After 3 days of infection, 100 \u03bcl of the steadylite reagent was added to each well, mixed by pipetting, and after 15 min the plates were scanned in a luminometer (Veritas\u2122 Microplate Luminometer, Turner BioSystems, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA 94085).",

Instead, efforts are more focused on culling of populations (e.g. vampire bats in Latin America) or controlling disease after spill-over into other animal hosts. The continued spillover of rabies virus strains to humans and domestic animals from terrestrial carnivores has led to the development of successful oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programs in Europe and North America. These campaigns often utilize recombinant viral vectors that stimulate immunity to the surface glycoprotein of rabies when ingested orally. When distributed in baits targeted toward certain rabies-carrying species, these vaccines lead to protection from the virus and reduction in local incidence of disease, and even local eradication of some strains of rabies [20], [51]. ORV programs are continually evolving and making use of the best available vaccine technology and disease modeling studies. In this study we assessed whether two attenuated poxviruses might be viable vaccine vectors in a bat species.",

Our studies demonstrate the tissue tropism and course of infection after exposure of a new animal model, T. brasiliensis, to attenuated orthopoxviruses. We show evidence of limited autologous spread of the viruses after ON exposure, although there is no evidence that the virus spreads outside of GI-associated tissues. MVA was cleared faster and resulted in less detectable luminescence compared to RCN, which may be expected due to the highly attenuated nature of MVA. The lack of significant difference in the levels of viral encoded protein (luciferase) production upon re-infection with RCN, as shown in the booster study (Fig. 3), may be important if bats had been previously exposed to RCN, or if boost inoculations of RCN-vectored vaccine are necessary. While neither vector caused clinical illness, the fact that RCN produced more viral encoded protein (luciferase) over a longer period suggests it is a more immunogenic vector when expressing heterologous antigens. Due to limitations of this study, we were not able to compare the immunogenicity of the vectors directly.",

While previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of injectable vaccines in this species [52], our study is the first to demonstrate effective mucosal vaccination. An average anti-rabies G titer of 5.14 IU at 60 dpi was detected in bats orally administered RCN-G, which is higher than the levels obtained after vaccination with the VR-G construct in any previous studies, including oral, IM, and scarification routes of exposure (28\u201330). While these differences may be due to the animal models used, this is additional evidence of the superiority of the RCN vector over vaccinia in bat species. Additionally, the previous studies failed to address the infectivity of vaccinia in the bat host, relying on the lack of clinical disease and development of protective immunity to assess the virus-host interaction. We were unable to assess the duration of immunity past 60 days, but this would be useful information to collect in future studies.",

While there was no evidence of shedding of live MVA virus, there was PCR evidence of vector DNA in oral swabs through 7 dpi; detection of live virus may have been limited due to the method used and the necessary lack of lower dilutions resulting from low sample volumes. One of the advantages of in vivo imaging studies is that it is not necessary to sacrifice animals to obtain data, and the bats used in this study went on to be used in a different investigation. Because of this, we were unable to assess organ tissue for evidence of pathology during the infection trials. However, the lack of any apparent morbidity in RCN-treated bats, along with RCN\u2019s natural history, record of success in various domestic and non-domestic species, and ability to induce immunity via the oral route, make it a very attractive candidate for use in free-ranging bats.",

In future work, topical vehicles will be developed that could be used to deliver oral vaccines to the fur coat of bats as they roost or are otherwise congregated. Bats are fastidious animals and spend a large proportion of their time self-grooming [53], which could lead to significant oral exposure to topically applied vaccines. A vaccine that would broadly protect free-ranging bats from rabies virus infection may reduce local incidence of rabies in certain bat populations, limiting the amount of spill-over into humans and other species. T. brasiliensis represents a species that roosts in dense colonies and is exposed to significant levels of circulating rabies virus in their population that may result in human exposures [54]. Therefore, a topically delivered rabies vaccine may be directly applicable to this species, but only if a method for mass application (such as a spray) could be developed. Further research is required to assess the viral vector in other species, such as vampire bats (Desmodus spp.), for which topically distributed poison protocols are well developed for culling of colonies [15], [55]. While culling has been successful in reducing overall numbers of Desmodus at a local level, it has not reduced the incidence of rabies in bat populations and may indeed be counterproductive [17]. Development of topical poxvirus vectored vaccines could potentially lead to effective, applicable, and practical means for reducing disease burden in some free ranging bat populations.",
