The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have released guidance on community mitigation strategies (CDC, n.d., WHO, 2020) ; limiting close social contact (i.e., social distancing) has previously been identified as critical to slowing the spread of pandemics and is ultimately expected to save countless lives (CDC, 2017) . In the United States, a national state of emergency was declared on March 13, 2020. During the state of emergency, applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a treatment for autism has generally been allowed to continue as an essential health service. However, as social-distancing restrictions tighten, the entire field is beginning to vet the feasibility and appropriateness of transitioning-at least temporarily-to telehealth, a service delivery model that for the purpose of this article will focus on live (synchronous) videoconferencing to deliver behavior-analytic services (i.e., the behavior therapist delivers instruction to the client via videoconferencing).",

The components may be interspersed in any way that facilitates the BCBA's ability to complete the assessment. As with any assessment, the consulting BCBA should first obtain consent, briefly describe the purpose of the assessment, and outline the entailed procedures (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2014). Figure 1 depicts the data sheet for Part 1, skill acquisition. The BCBA first instructs the caregiver to gather any required materials and reinforcers and then requests the caregiver to direct the client to attend to the screen (i.e., the synchronous video display of the BCBA). The BCBA attempts to run several client goals: three that have been previously mastered and generalized across people and/or settings, three that have met mastery criteria under strict stimulus conditions but are not yet meaningfully generalized, and three that are in acquisition or in progress. While running these programs, the BCBA records clinical impressions across the following fields: the number of redirections needed for the client to attend to the screen/BCBA, the number of minutes and trials to which the client attends, the least intrusive successful prompts, and the schedule of reinforcement required to maintain correct responding. The BCBA should additionally note the caregiver's ability to prompt, redirect, and deliver reinforcement. Figure 2 depicts the data sheet for Part 2, behavior management. The BCBA starts by reviewing the intervention plan with the caregiver. During the review, the BCBA guides the caregiver to create a naturalistic routine, during which time the caregiver implements antecedent strategies and prompts replacement behaviors. Next, the BCBA guides the caregiver to create the contingencies to evoke moderate-intensity (i.e., manageable) problem behavior. Care should be taken to avoid triggering severe problem behavior that cannot be safely managed by the caregiver. The BCBA provides real-time feedback and guidance to the caregiver as they work to implement the behavior plan. The BCBA assesses whether the caregiver can implement all strategies within the plan independently, with repeated reminders, or whether the caregiver is unable to implement the plan, even with prompting.",

The matrix serves as a tool to categorize clients' repertoires based on their prompting needs, responses to reinforcement schedules, and intensity of problem behaviors. The tool further helps the BCBA assess caregivers' repertoires based on their ability to facilitate session structure and to manage problem behaviors.

The client demonstrates the ability to respond to distance prompts-that is, prompts that would be delivered by the BT via video meeting. It is optimal that the client does not rely on physical prompting to respond to learning trials. Alternatively, the client may require physical prompts, but in that case, the BCBA notes during the assessment that the caregiver is adept at delivering these consistently and is ideally able to fade prompts with coaching from the BT. The client demonstrates the ability to self-manage a reinforcement system or to tolerate delayed reinforcement, or the client responds consistently to a reinforcement schedule delivered by the caregiver. In some instances, the repertoire presented by the learner may include an advanced skill set (e.g., a client being treated primarily for impacted social skills).

For example, teaching the client to travel to the caregiver to recruit reinforcement once earned may improve the client's likelihood of obtaining reinforcement under generalized contingencies. Such programming could also provide a benefit to the caregiver, who may need to attend to other priorities that conflict with fully facilitating sessions.

In the event that the caregiver and clinical team are in agreement on the focus and direction of the program and the caregiver is relatively well trained, the caregiver may simply require coaching to sharpen his or her skill set for foundational skills related to facilitating the treatment plan (e.g., redirection, prompting, and delivery of reinforcement). In other cases, the caregiver and clinical team may be well aligned, but the caregiver requires more advanced training and coaching (e.g., implementation of behavior management strategies or specific prompting and fading strategies).

First, although the content of this tool consists of evidence-based practices, this tool, itself, has not yet undergone empirical field testing. Therefore, the potential added benefit of using this tool has not been confirmed by research. It would be valuable to conduct formal research on the effectiveness of this model as a practical tool for transitioning clients historically served in person to a fully telehealth model. A second potential limitation relates to the very use of telehealth for the delivery of direct ABA services. Multiple studies, such as those summarized by Healy and Lydon (2013) , support that a robust intensity of direct service (typically falling between 20 and 40 hours per week) is associated with optimal outcomes in behavior-analytic treatment. Although caregiver consultation is a valuable element to incorporate into behavioranalytic programs, the literature does not suggest that a caregiverled model would outperform a model implemented directly by a professional trained extensively in ABA. A potential limitation of telehealth services in general, particularly in models indicating caregiver facilitation, is that the intensity of services may be particularly limited based on caregiver availability. This is problematic, in that the outcome literature does not suggest that some small amount of treatment is better than nothing. Therefore, care should be taken to maintain an intensity of services that reflects best practice literature and is matched to the individual needs of the client, even while pursuing a telehealth model. This is why it is so critical to move clients toward a model that lessens reliance on caregiver facilitation (i.e., through less intrusive prompting and thinned schedules of reinforcement). Although this potential limitation is a grave concern, if in-person services are not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems plausible that delivery of telehealth services is likely to produce some benefits to the client over no services at all.",

This not only pertains to those who present with the most intense problem behaviors and the poorest attending skills but also to those whose socioeconomic status or physical geographical location limits access to a reliable Internet connection or to Internetenabled devices to facilitate a secure video connection. These same factors may limit a caregiver's availability to facilitate as well, especially amid a crisis that has led to some caregivers managing multiple contingencies-as caregiver, employee, homeschooler, and more. However, it may be the case that implementing telehealth services in appropriate instances will allow for the allocation of resources to the smaller subset of clients for whom in-person service delivery is essential to maintain their safety (e.g., reducing the number of clients being seen in a clinic, or reducing the number of clients and homes with which a BT comes in contact).",

When all social functioning has returned to normal-or the new picture of normal-there will still be clients to serve who do not have access to consistent, in-person ABA services. A number of logistical challenges can be resolved by delivering telehealth services. If through this crisis, the field of ABA can uncover tools to responsibly transition to telehealth services in a way that maintains clinical integrity and desired client outcomes, there are a number of potential benefits. Immediately, clients will continue to access services, and countless jobs will be saved during the greatest crisis of a generation.
