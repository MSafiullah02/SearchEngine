            "text": "ISG15 is a 17 kD ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) that is rapidly induced by type 1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2). Induction by interferon implied, more than 20 years ago, that ISG15 was a component of the innate immune response (Farrell et al., 1979); however, it has only been recently confirmed that ISG15 has antiviral activity against several types of viruses, including influenza, sindbis, herpes, human immunodeficiency, and ebola (Hsiang et al., 2009, Lenschow et al., 2005, Okumura et al., 2006, Okumura et al., 2008). In addition, several viruses have evolved mechanisms for interfering with ISG15 function: the NS1 protein of influenza B blocks ISG15 conjugation (Chang et al., 2008, Yuan and Krug, 2001), SARS coronavirus encodes an ISG15 deconjugating enzyme (Lindner et al., 2007), and the vaccinia E3 protein binds to ISG15 and blocks its antiviral activity (Guerra et al., 2008). The ability of ISG15 to be conjugated to other proteins has been shown in some cases to be essential for its antiviral activity (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009, Lai et al., 2009). The biochemical function of ISG15 conjugation and the basis of the antiviral activities of ISG15 conjugation remain unknown.",

The human ISG15 E1 enzyme is Ube1L (Yuan and Krug, 2001), and the E2 enzyme is UbcH8/Ube2L6 (Durfee et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2004). The major E3 for human ISG15 is Herc5, a HECT domain ligase that contains N-terminal RCC1 repeats (Dastur et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2006). Herc5 depletion results in a dramatic decrease in ISG15 conjugation, affecting conjugation to the vast majority of cellular target proteins (Dastur et al., 2006), and coexpression of ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 in non-IFN-stimulated cells reconstitutes broad and robust ISG15 conjugation (Dastur et al., 2006, Takeuchi et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2006). Herc5 has also been shown to have antiviral activity against influenza A virus (Zhao et al., 2010). EFP, a RING E3, has been reported to be an additional E3 for ISG15; however, only a single target has been reported (Zou and Zhang, 2006). Therefore, whereas additional proteins may play a role in ISG15 conjugation, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 represent the core IFN-induced components of this conjugation system in human cells.",

These targets were present in many cellular compartments, and no functional classes of proteins were particularly overrepresented, although 12 IFN-induced human proteins were identified (Zhao et al., 2005). A common structural or primary sequence element that confers ISG15 conjugation has not been identified, nor have poly-ISG15 chains been observed. Importantly, only a small fraction of the pool of a given target protein is generally modified (Zhao et al., 2005). These observations raise the following questions: (1) how can a single ISG15 ligase be responsible for targeting such a large and diverse set of proteins, (2) what is the biochemical effect of ISG15 conjugation on target proteins, and (3) how can modification of a small fraction of any individual target protein have a significant effect on the overall activity of that protein? The findings presented here lead to a model that accounts for broad substrate targeting in the ISG15 system and provide a basis for understanding the antiviral activity of ISG15 conjugation.",

Surprisingly, when such lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against previously identified target proteins, it was difficult to observe their modification. This is seen in Figure 1B for two such proteins, IQGAP1 and Ube1. Whereas modification of both proteins could be detected on very long exposures, modification of Hsc70 (Figure 1B) and four other constitutively expressed target proteins could not be detected (Table S1 available online). The success rate for validation of IFN-induced target proteins was higher, with three out of five targets confirmed, as shown for p56 (Figure 1C) and summarized in Table S1. As negative controls, five proteins not previously identified as targets of ISG15 modification were examined, and none of these were detectably modified in IFN-\u03b2-stimulated cells (Table S1).",

These results prompted us to assay, as presumptive negative controls, several epitope-tagged human proteins that had not been previously identified as ISG15 targets. Five out of seven of these were also found to be ISGylated, including E6AP, p53, Dlg, Herc4, and Herc6 (Figures 3A and S2 and Table S2).

Three proteins were identified that were consistently not ISGylated in this assay system: GFP, human Wbp2, and a 35 kD carboxy-terminal fragment of paxillin.

Figure 4A (left panels) shows the relative levels of exogenously and endogenously expressed proteins in the absence of ISG15 (expression of target protein with Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5, without ISG15), using an antibody that detects both proteins. The exogenously expressed proteins could be detected by 6 hr posttransfection for both TAP-Ube1 and TAP-IQGAP1. For Ube1, the levels of the exogenous protein did not exceed that of endogenous Ube1, even at 30 hr posttransfection, whereas, for IQGAP1, the levels of exogenous protein were similar and perhaps slightly higher than endogenous IQGAP1 at 24 and 30 hr posttransfection (correcting for the \u223c50% transfection efficiency). However, at the 18 hr time point, when the exogenously expressed proteins were clearly less abundant than the endogenously expressed proteins, ISGylation of the exogenously expressed proteins was detected when the target protein was expressed with all four conjugation components (Figure 4A, middle). In contrast, modification of the endogenous proteins was not detectable at any time point (Figure 4A, right). Therefore, the preferential modification of exogenously expressed proteins was not due to a higher steady-state level of the exogenously expressed target proteins.",

Also, in the five-plasmid transfections, the mRNA levels encoding the exogenously expressed proteins were \u223c10-fold higher than the corresponding endogenously expressed mRNAs (based on three examples, Figure S4A), suggesting that the exogenously expressed proteins, though not present at a higher steady-state level, were translated at a higher rate. These distinctions suggested that ISG15 conjugation might be limited to the newly synthesized pool of any given target protein. An additional observation consistent with this was the relatively high success rate for validation of IFN-induced ISG15 targets (e.g., p56, MxA) in IFN-stimulated cells (see Table S1), wherein the entire pool of these proteins is, by definition, newly synthesized.",

Twenty-four hours later, the ISG15 conjugation machinery was expressed by a four-plasmid transfection, with or without cotransfection of a siRNA targeting the mRNA encoding the plasmid-expressed target protein. Extracts were prepared 22 hr after the second transfection, and the target protein was analyzed for ISGylation. Our hypothesis predicted that, if ISG15 modification was dependent on protein synthesis, then siRNA-mediated destruction of the mRNA would result in a loss of ISGylation of the target protein. That is, the pre-existing pool of the target protein, synthesized in the first 24 hr, would not be modified. In contrast, in the absence of a specific siRNA or in the presence of an off-target siRNA, the target protein would continue to be synthesized, and ISGylation would be observed. This experiment was dependent on the rate of degradation of the target protein, and for the targets analyzed, protein levels did not decline more than 2-fold after siRNA transfection (Figure S4B). RT-PCR also confirmed that the specific siRNAs led to > 80% knockdown of the target siRNAs by 12 hr posttransfection (data not shown). Figure 4C shows the results for analysis of TAP-IQGAP1 and TAP-p53. ISGylation of both proteins was observed in the absence of any siRNA or in the presence of off-target siRNAs but was greatly diminished in the presence of a specific siRNA.

In preliminary experiments, we determined that ISG15 conjugates became evident \u223c12 hr after a four-plasmid transfection (FLAG-ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5). Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with the four plasmids and then pulse-labeled with 35S-labeled cysteine either before conjugation was occurring (6 hr posttransfection) or while conjugation was occurring (22 hr posttransfection). Total cell lysates were collected 24 hr posttransfection, and an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Our hypothesis predicted that 35S-containing proteins labeled at the early time point would not be ISGylated, whereas proteins labeled at the late time point, while conjugation was occurring, would be susceptible to ISGylation. A broad range of labeled proteins were conjugated to ISG15 in cells labeled at the 22 hr time point, whereas the pattern of labeled immunoprecipitated proteins from the early labeling period was only slightly above that seen in control untransfected cells (Figure 5B, compare lane 2 to lanes 1, 5, and 6). The slight signal over background in the lanes corresponding to the early labeling period may be due to either a secondary mode of ISG15 conjugation (e.g., a minor Herc5-independent conjugation pathway) or due to turnover of the 35S-cysteine and re-incorporation into newly translated proteins at later time points. This experiment was also performed using a FLAG-ISG15 expression plasmid encoding an ISG15 mutant lacking the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (FLAG-ISG15-\u0394N), which is conjugated similarly to wild-type ISG15. As above, 35S-labeled proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-ISG15-\u0394N when cells were labeled at the 22 hr time point, but not when cells were labeled at the 6 hr time point (Figure 5B, lanes 3 and 4). An anti-FLAG western blot of total extracts indicated that conjugation was robust in all samples expressing the conjugation components, regardless of the point at which the cells were labeled with 35S-cysteine (Figure S5). TCA precipitations of the extracts indicated that total protein labeling (dpm/\u03bcg of total protein) was similar among all samples (data not shown). These results were consistent with the notion that proteins are only subject to ISG15 conjugation if they are synthesized in the window of time that the conjugation machinery is active.",

Ribosome- and polysome-containing fractions, including the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, were identified by characteristic absorbance profiles at 254 nm and confirmed by immunoblotting with antiribosomal subunit antibodies. As shown in Figure 6A, the vast majority of Herc5 protein was within the polysome-containing fractions. Herc5 cofractionated with 80S ribosomes when extracts were treated with RNase (Figure 6B), which destroys the polysomes and leads to a large increase in the number of 80S ribosomes. This suggested that Herc5 was associated with polysomes via ribosomes, rather than mRNA. Consistent with this, Herc5 cofractionated with 60S ribosomes when extracts were treated with EDTA (Figure 6C), which dissociates polysomes and 80S ribosomes into 40S and 60S subunits. EDTA also releases nascent polypeptides from the 60S subunit (Ullers et al., 2004, Valent et al., 1997), suggesting that Herc5 was unlikely to be tethered to ribosomes via nascent polypeptides. Herc4 is a HECT domain ligase that has 57% primary sequence similarity to Herc5 (Hochrainer et al., 2005), but it is not IFN induced and does not function in ISG15 conjugation.

Deletion of this entire region (\u0394RCC) abrogates ISGylation of target proteins (Dastur et al., 2006), as does deletion of amino acids 2\u2013100 (\u0394100); however, both proteins retain catalytic activity based on autoconjugation activity (Figure S6). Full-length HA-tagged Herc5 expressed by transfection was present in the polysome fractions (Figure 6D), although it was also present in earlier ribosome-containing fractions of the gradient, probably due to the \u223c5-fold overexpression of HA-Herc5 relative to the IFN-induced levels of Herc5 in HeLa cells. In contrast, both the HA-\u0394RCC and HA-\u0394100 Herc5 proteins were present almost exclusively in the earliest fractions of the gradient. Therefore, the RCC1 repeat region of Herc5 is essential for both ISGylation and polysome association.",

Type 1 IFNs are secreted by virus-infected cells to establish an antiviral state in uninfected surrounding cells. As these cells are likely to be the next sites of virus infection, we propose that the ISGylation system is designed to target newly synthesized viral proteins. However, even among newly synthesized proteins, ISGylation is inefficient, raising the question of how modification of a small fraction of a viral protein could have a significant antiviral effect. The answer may lie in the fact that structural proteins are not only among the most actively synthesized of viral proteins, but must often assemble into precise repeating geometric configurations to form infectious virus particles (e.g., capsid proteins). Therefore, ISGylation of even a small fraction of the total pool of a viral structural protein might have a dominant-negative effect on production of infectious virus.",

We therefore employed an HPV pseudovirus (PsV) system to measure the effect of ISGylation on infectivity (Buck et al., 2004, Buck and Thompson, 2007). Papillomavirus virions are composed of 360 molecules of the L1 capsid protein and up to 72 molecules of L2 (Buck et al., 2008). When L1 and L2 are expressed in the presence of an \u223c8 kbp GFP expression plasmid, the plasmid is packaged as if it were viral genomic DNA; these PsV can then be isolated on velocity-density gradients and their infectivity measured by quantitating the delivery of the GFP reporter plasmid to naive cells. HPV16 pseudoviruses were generated in 293TT cells in which ISG15 conjugation was either occurring (cotransfection of ISG15 and E1, E2, E3 enzymes) or not occurring (cotransfection of ISG15 and inactive mutant forms of the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes). The presence of assembled PsV at the expected gradient fractions (Buck et al., 2004) was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown). In the ISGylated PsV fractions, \u223c10% of the total L1 protein was ISGylated (Figure 7B). The total amount of L1 protein in ISGylated PsV fractions was \u223c30% less than in the control PsV fractions. Together, these observations indicated that ISGylated L1 was incorporated into PsV particles but that the overall yield of PsV was decreased. To examine the infectivity of ISGylated and non-ISGylated PsV, the peak gradient fractions were added to the culture media of 293T cells, followed by quantitation of GFP-positive cells by FACS analysis. Without normalization for total L1 concentration, the infectivity of ISGylated PsV was decreased \u223c80% relative to the non-ISGylated PsV in three independent experiments (Figure 7C). With normalization, the infectivity of ISGylated PsV was \u223c70% lower than non-ISGylated PsV (Figure 7C). These results establish that low-level ISGylation of a viral structural protein can have a dominant-negative effect on virus infectivity.",

As the exit tunnel for nascent polypeptides is on the 60S subunit (Kramer et al., 2009), an attractive model is that Herc5 modifies newly synthesized polypeptides cotranslationally as they emerge from the exit tunnel. Of interest, other protein modification enzymes have been identified that are ribosome associated and function near the exit tunnel, including methionine isopeptidase (Raue et al., 2007, Vetro and Chang, 2002), N-terminal acetyltransferases (Green et al., 1978, Pestana and Pitot, 1975), and chaperones that aid in cotranslational folding of proteins (Kramer et al., 2009). Polysome association of Herc5 suggests that the inclusion of a translation system will be a requirement for reconstitution of in vitro ISGylation, which, in turn, is likely to be required for a direct test of the cotranslational model. Also, it is important to note that, though the range of ISG15 target proteins appears extremely broad, not all newly synthesized proteins were ISGylated in our assays. Factors that might influence susceptibility to modification include rates of translation, cotranslational folding rates, and the sequence or secondary structure context of lysine acceptors.",

The low degree of target protein selectivity of the ISG15 system is consistent with the requirement that the innate immune response protect cells against a wide range of pathogens. An implication of this model is that modification of cellular target proteins may be simply collateral damage in the attempt to target viral proteins. This, in turn, may be tied to the observation that ISGylation is relatively inefficient: an inefficient ISGylation system might protect against excessive damage to cellular proteins while at the same time still being an effective antiviral due to dominant-negative effects on abundantly expressed virus structural proteins, as shown here with the HPV pseudovirus system. These results are consistent with results showing that mutant forms of viral structural proteins can, themselves, have a dominant-negative effect on infectivity (Lee et al., 2009). In addition, potential dominant-negative effects of ISGylation are not necessarily limited to effects on virus structural proteins; any viral protein that oligomerizes would be a potential biologically relevant target in our model.",

The two most general possibilities are that ISG15 signals to another protein or protein complex (e.g., in the way that ubiquitin signals to the proteasome) or that it simply disrupts the function of proteins to which it is conjugated. There is evidence to support the latter in studies that have examined individual target proteins (Jeon et al., 2009, Zou et al., 2005), and this may also be inferred by ISG15 protein sequence comparisons between mammalian species. Unlike ubiquitin and most other Ubls, ISG15 protein sequences are very divergent. Only 72 out of 157 residues (46%) are identical between the human, mouse, rat, dog, cow, and sheep ISG15 protein sequences. We suggest that these divergent mammalian ISG15 proteins are unlikely to have retained a common signaling function and that the similarity retained reflects that which is required for maintaining the ubiquitin-like folds of ISG15 and for productive interaction with the conjugation enzymes. We therefore suggest that the function of ISG15 is to generally disrupt target protein function and, in particular, the functions of viral proteins.",

The FLAG-ISG15 construct used in this experiment contained the C78S mutation, eliminating the only cysteine residue in ISG15. The C78S mutant is fully functional for conjugation, and the use of this mutant ensured that the 35S-cysteine-containing proteins detected in the immunoprecipitation represented labeled cellular proteins that had been conjugated to unlabeled ISG15, as opposed to unlabeled proteins being conjugated to 35S-labeled ISG15. Similarly, the \u0394N-ISG15 construct lacked C78. Cells were washed with PBS and either harvested immediately (late labeling period) or replenished with fresh media. Cell lysates were collected and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. For puromycin experiments, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and treated, 24 hr posttransfection, with puromycin (1 mM final concentration) for 2 min. Total cell extracts were prepared and FLAG-ISG15 conjugates were precipitated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing puromycin.",

In the presence of the target siRNA (right), target protein mRNA would be destroyed as the conjugation components are expressed, but previously synthesized protein persist as a function of their rate of destruction; if continued target protein synthesis is required for ISGylation, then ISGylation of the target protein should not occur.
