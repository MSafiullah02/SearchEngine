A recent development of this cyclic aryltriazene is represented by benzotriazepinones,10 that are very promising agents against breast cancer. It is worth noting that these compounds are weak alkylating agents and may damage DNA by a novel mechanism.",

Interestingly, some halogenated benzotriazoles have been shown to inhibit the NTPase/helicase activities of hepatitis C and related viruses.15 Aromatic and heteroaromatic esters of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole were found to strongly inhibit (K\ni\n = 7.5 nM) the 3CL-protease, which is essential for the replication of the coronavirus responsible of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).16 More recently, a set of benzotriazole derivatives have been found endowed with potent activity against RSV and moderate activity against YFV, BVDV and CVB-2.17\n",

Indeed, we can observe a good agreement between the trend exhibited by the IC50 values reported in Table 6 and the corresponding biological activity determined for these compounds in BVDV infected cell line (see Table 3). Although we obviously cannot directly compare the computed binding free energy (and hence the corresponding IC50) with the EC50 values deriving from experiment, we can observe that, in most cases, the rank of the inhibitors with respect to their activity towards their putative targets, the RdRps of BVDV, is maintained, although with some discrepancies. In fact, all estimated IC50 values are systematically higher than those determined by in vitro experiments with infected cell lines.",

First of all, the binding site identified by our procedure is very close to the putative binding site proposed for two allosteric inhibitors of BVDV RdRp, VP32947 and BPIP,23 and involves residue F224 (see Fig. 5d), a residue found mutated into S224 in BVDV BPIP-resistant clones. The binding pocket is located in a turn of the fingers domain between two \u03b2-sheets which is believed to be involved in finger flexibility for RNA template/product translocation,35 dimerization of the RdRp in the replication complex, or protein/protein interactions,36, 37 enabling the assembly of an active replication complex. According to our docking results, then, the hypothetical binding of our compounds to the polymerase could affect the finger flexibility or impair the capacity of the protein to translocate its template/product during RNA polymerization. Alternatively, the diarylazo moiety could possibly act by hampering the entrance of the template RNA in the template binding cavity.",

One of the explanations why we find IC50 values higher than the corresponding EC50 could be explained by the following rationale. Recently an attempt of co-crystallize the BVDV RdRp with the inhibitor VP32947 failed do to a dimer interface near the putative binding site of VP32947 in the BVDV RdRp crystal. The authors of the work proposed that the formation of this dimer could constitute an important point in the replication complex. Moreover, it was also hypothesized that the top of the fingers domain could be a protein-docking site pivotal to the interactions with other enzymes of the replicase complex. As the VP32947 binding site is part of the putative binding pocket for our molecular series, it could be that, upon binding, our compounds hinder the interactions among different proteins making up the replicase complex.",

            "text": "Now, given the similarity among the polymerases of pestiviruses, hepaciviruses, and flaviviruses, any knowledge gained from any one of these viral systems is likely to foster progress in the others. Given the high importance of the hepatitis C pandemic and the stringent need for efficient therapeutics for this pathology, it is expected that new molecular entities such as those described in this work can provide meaningful insights towards the identification of possible anti-HCV agents. Interestingly, the overall sequence identity between BVDV and HCV RdRp proteins is quite low, approximately 30%. If we consider the alignment of BVDV and HCV RdRp reported in Figure 4c, and in particular focus on the highlighted fingers domain part, we can immediately speculate that: (i) the F224 residue in the BVDV protein has no counterpart in the corresponding HCV enzyme; accordingly, if the drug would bind in the same binding pocket with the same binding mode, there should in principle be no problem of resistant mutant at this position. (ii) The important region of K263\u2013K266 in the BVDV RdRp is highly conserved in the corresponding HCV polymerase (KNEK in BVDV and KNEV in HCV, respectively, see Fig. 4c); importantly, both K263 and E265 are engaged in fundamental stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the inhibitors in the BVDV case but, being conserved, they are able to establish the same interactions with the compounds also in the case of HCV. (iii) The residue Y289 of BVDV RdRp is not conserved in the corresponding HCV polymerase, being replaced by a phenylalanine. Therefore, the anchoring hydrogen bond between the Y289 \u2013OH group and, for instance, the tertiary nitrogen of 1 can no longer take place. Taken all together, these evidences can justify a minor potency of this molecular series towards the HCV RdRp as a target with respect to the BVDV counterpart. At the same time, in the case of both viruses, the binding pockets on the respective RdRps do share a sufficient degree of structural and sequence homology; thus, since these regions involve the fingers domains, which overhang the palm domains of the enzymes, they might be involved in RNA substrate recognition and, hence, the inhibitor molecules may affect the RdRps interactions with the incoming RNA molecule.",

At the end of the relaxation process, all water molecules beyond the first hydration shell (i.e., at a distance > 3.5 \u00c5 from any protein atom) were removed. Finally, to achieve electroneutrality, a suitable number of counterions were added to neutralize the system using the leap module of amber 9, removing eventually overlapping water molecules. To reduce computational time to reasonable limits, all proteins residues with any atom closer than 20 \u00c5 from the center of mass of each bounded ligand were chosen to be flexible in the dynamic simulations. Subsequently, a spherical TIP3P water cap of radius equal to 20 \u00c5 was centered on each inhibitor in the corresponding RdRp complex, including the hydrating water molecules within the sphere resulting from the previous step. After energy minimization of the new water cap for 10 ps, keeping the protein, the ligand, and the pre-existing waters rigid, followed by a MD equilibration of the entire water sphere with fixed solute for 1 ns, further unfavorable interactions within the structures were relieved by progressively smaller positional restraints on the solute (from 25 to 0 kcal/(mol \u00c52) for a total of 2 ns.

In this work we applied the latter variant. Accordingly, the term E\nint in Eq. 2 cancels out in the calculation of the free energy of binding. The calculations of the polar solvation term G\nPB were done with the DelPhi package,49 with interior and exterior dielectric constants equal to 1 and 80, respectively. A grid spacing of 2/\u00c5, extending 20% beyond the dimensions of the solute, was employed. The non-polar component GNP was obtained using the following relationship: G\nNP\n = \n\u03b3SA + \n\u03b2, in which \u03b3\n = 0.00542 kcal/(mol \u00c52), \u03b2\n = 0.92 kcal/mol, and the surface area was estimated by means of the msms software.50 The last parameter in Eq. 1, that is, the change in solute entropy upon association \u2013TSsolute, was calculated through normal-mode analysis. In the first step of this calculation, an 8-\u00c5 sphere around the ligand was cut out from an MD snapshot for each ligand-protein complex. This value was shown to be large enough to yield converged mean changes in solute entropy. On the basis of the size-reduced snapshots of the complex, we generated structures of the uncomplexed reactants by removing the atoms of the protein and ligand, respectively. Each of those structures was minimized, using a distance-dependent dielectric constant \u03b5\n = 4r, to account for solvent screening, and its entropy was calculated using classical statistical formulas and normal mode-analysis. To minimize the effects due to different conformations adopted by individual snapshots we averaged the estimation of entropy over 50 snapshots.",
