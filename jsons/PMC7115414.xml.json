Its sudden emergence and rapid outbreak during 2002\u20132003 had resulted in \u223c800 deaths among >8000 reported individual cases worldwide [1]. Although the SARS epidemic had been under control for years, reemergence of this threatening illness is still a possible risk and potentially new strains of SARS can be more dangerous than the previous ones. A number of important targets have been recognized to take part in the biological events critical to SARS-CoV replication, among which a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) are of significant importance to design anti-SARS inhibitors [2]. The 3CLpro, also known as the main protease (Mpro), has attracted much attention, which could be revealed from numerous publications about novel inhibitor discovery. Crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro, either free enzyme alone or in complex with an inhibitor, had been determined to facilitate the structural and functional investigation of this protease [3], [4]. The active site of SARS-CoV Mpro contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.",

The inhibitory activities of these compounds were then validated by in vitro protease assays. In most cases the kinetic study indicated that the inhibitor is involved in an irreversible process by forming a covalent bond with Cys145, while in some other cases the inhibition is actually a reversible behavior. The reported SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors covered a variety of different chemical scaffolds, which contain peptidomimetic compounds, 3-quinoline carboxylic acid derivatives, thiophene-2-carboxylate derivatives, zinc-conjugated compounds, cinanserin, calmodulin, keto-glutamine analogues, anilide, bifunctional boronic acid compounds, isatin derivatives, etacrynic acid derivatives, serine derivatives, trifluoromethyl ketones, acetamides, pyrazolone and quercertins [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. It is a pity that research on drugs and vaccines towards SARS or SARS-like coronavirus has not brought any candidate for clinical use. Hence there still exists an urgent need to discover and identify new SARS-CoV Mpro agents, especially those compounds from totally new chemical families, to develop effective therapy against this fatal viral infection.",

There are a few cases that simple disulfides such as diallyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide exhibit hypochlorous acid scavenging activity and tyrosinase inhibitory activity (Fig. 1\nA) [14], [15]. The unsymmetrical disulfide compounds are useful tools in the research of dynamic combinatorial chemistry [16]. These compounds have also been reported to display a variety of biological activities. For examples, Turos et al. reported that some unsymmetrical aryl-alkyl disulfides were inhibitors of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis (Fig. 1B) [17], while Khosla and co-workers published some unsymmetrical disulfides that could selectively inhibit extracellular thioredoxin (Fig. 1C) [18]. Yoon et al. showed that some unsymmetrical disulfide compounds were inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Haemophilus influenzae, by interfering with acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of branched chain amino-acids (Fig. 1D) [19], [20]. In the past of our research, we found that some unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides could inhibit plant AHAS and was useful for herbicide research (Fig. 1E) [21], [22].",

Subsequent enzymatic kinetics study indicated that the aromatic disulfides acted as reversible and non-competitive inhibitors.

It is a quite straightforward nucleophilic substitution, in which the thiol group in the mercapto compound serves as a nucleophilic reagent and attacks the sulfur atom in the arenesulfenyl chloride. Most yields for the reactions were satisfactory, showing that this is a simple and easy procedure to produce unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides, superior to the synthetic route developed by Hahn et al. [26]. In Hahn's paper, moist tetrahydrofuran gave better yields than dried benzene as the solvent for the reaction, so the authors added 5\u201310 M equivalent of water to the reaction mixture and observed satisfactory yields. Thus, the presence of water was thought to be preferable for the reaction by Hahn et al. [26]. In our synthesis experiment, only ethyl ether was used as the solvent and no additional water was added to the reaction, nevertheless, we observed very high yields for most of the target compounds.",

The lines displayed in reciprocal plots intersect at a same point, indicating that both inhibitors serve as a non-competitive inhibitor with \u03b1 < 1 (Part 3 of the supplementary data) [27].

It is known that, if a disulfide reacts with another thiol to give a new disulfide, the thiols that are parts of the old disulfide can also react directly with this thiol to form the same new disulfide [29]. We tested the biological activities of different aryl thiols derived from our disulfides, and no inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro could be detected for any of them even at very high concentration. Accordingly it seemed unlikely that Cys145 formed a \u2014S-S- bond by reacting with the target disulfide compounds. Another method to rule out this possibility is to determine the change of the molecular weight of the protein before and after inhibition [30], [31]. If the disulfide compound reacts with Cys145, the molecular weight would have a shift after SARS-CoV Mpro is inhibited, and this is approximately the mass of half moiety of the unsymmetrical disulfide. Bearing this in mind, we measured the molecular weight of protease before and after inhibition by three disulfide compounds with significant structure difference (3-8, 3-31 and 3-39, data shown in part 4 of the supplementary data). However, no such assumed shift in the molecular weight was observed to support this idea.",

Therefore, in silico molecular docking technique was utilized to predict possible binding modes of the disulfide compounds with SARS-CoV Mpro. In our previous study, we had docked a small library of isatin compounds to the active site of AHAS and probable binding modes were predicted by FlexX [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Here similar strategy was adopted to carry out database docking. After investigation of the resulting docked conformations, nineteen compounds were found to overlay one another quite well (Part 5 of the supplementary data), while all the other twenty-one compounds were in unreasonable binding space, and they failed to overlay well with one another. Thus, the docked conformations of the nineteen compounds were thought to be the possible binding conformations in this study. Compound 3-31 was chosen to depict the binding mode of the disulfide inhibitors. Fig. 4\nis a two-dimensional illustration of the interactions between the inhibitor and the surrounding residues of SARS-CoV Mpro drawn by LIGPLOT [38]. The location of 3-31 has some overlap with the inhibitor N9, the inhibitor in the original pdb file. The compound binds with SARS-CoV Mpro via multiple hydrogen bonding contacts and hydrophobic contacts. Phe140, Leu141, His163, Met165, Glu166 and His172 form hydrophobic interactions with the small molecule, while Asn142, Gly143 and Cys145 form intermolecular H-bond with the inhibitor. The predicted binding mode therefore provides a useful clue to understand the possible molecular basis of these inhibitors.",

For the steric contour map, a bulky group is favorable for better inhibition in the green contour region and such a group is likely to decrease the activity in the yellow contour space. The green maps are mostly in three bulks: one formed by Ser1and Leu141, one formed by Asn142 and Gly143 and the last one formed by Ser144 and Cys145; whereas the yellow maps are just located in a space nearby Gly143. For the electrostatic contour map, in the blue contour region, an increase in the positive charge will lead to an increase of activity, yet in the red contour region, negative charge is favorable to enhance the activity. The blue map is in a region surrounded by Leu27, Cly143, Ser144 and Cys145, whereas the red maps are in three cavities: one formed by Leu141 and Asn142, one formed by Ser144, Cys145 and Met165 and the last one formed by Asn142 and Gly143. The 3D CoMFA maps have afforded important structural features of the unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides from steric and electrostatic views, which is valuable for further design and discovery of more potent inhibitors.",

Therefore it is still an urgent demand to discover novel anti-SARS inhibitors to combat this deadly disease. SARS CoV Mpro is an important target for the design of therapeutically useful drugs. In the present study, in an effort to develop non-peptidic anti-SARS inhibitors, we have identified for the first time, that some unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides are excellent inhibitors of SARS CoV Mpro, the mechanism of which seems distinct as they are reversible and mpetitive inhibitors. This suggests that the unsymmetrical disulfides are promising lead compounds identification and development of a new family of biologically active anti-SARS agents. A possible binding model of the disulfide inhibitor was built by molecular docking, and a CoMFA model was constructed subsequently to point out the structural features of these novel inhibitors of SARS CoV Mpro. Based on this information, further structural modifications are ongoing for better pharmaceutical compounds. The Lipinski rules will also be utilized to help to develop compounds with a final in vivo activity [42]. We are also trying to co-crystallize the protease and the best inhibitor, to gain insight into a real binding mode and explain the molecular basis of these compounds.",

Synthetic methods for compounds 3\u2032 had been reported and these parent compounds for 3-4, 3-6. 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10 and 3-11 had also been fully characterized before [21]. Melting points were determined using an X-4 melting apparatus and were uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR were obtained using a 400 MHz Varian Mercury Plus 400 spectrometer. The chemical shift values (d) for the NMR spectra were reported as parts per million (ppm), using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d\n6) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage LC/mass detector instrument.",
