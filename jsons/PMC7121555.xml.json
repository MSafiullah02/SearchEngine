In her work, Avery characterized early onset of respiratory distress in eight late premature infants with radiographic findings of lung hyperinflation, increased pulmonary vascular markings and cardiomegaly. Symptoms were mild and transient with infants improving in a 2\u20135 day period. Until recently, it was believed that once TTN resolves, there is no added respiratory morbidity or long-term effect on the infant [12\u201314]. However, a recent large retrospective study of term infants suggested that TTN might be significantly associated with childhood asthma with increased propensity in males. This study also suggested TTN as a marker of diminished pulmonary function, which may reflect an inherited susceptibility to asthma [15].",

The lung\u2019s functional residual capacity comprises a potential air space of 20\u201330 mL/kg body weight. This space is filled in utero with fetal lung fluid containing high potassium and chloride, and low bicarbonate and protein. Shifts between [15, 22\u2013 25]. Two to three days prior to delivery, the fetus begins its lung fluid clearance in anticipation of transition to extrauterine life. This process begins with a decreased rate of fetal lung fluid secretion. The major clearance takes place with the onset of labor. At this time, the lung epithelium becomes a sodium absorbing membrane and lung fluid flow is directed from the air space to the intersititum. In addition, low protein containing lung fluid exhibits low oncotic pressure, which is another driving force for lung fluid to enter the vascular system.",

The maternal history is often positive for maternal anesthesia, maternal diabetes, or cesarean section. Arterial blood gas is likely to show mild respiratory acidosis with potential hypoxemia. Chest radiographs typically demonstrates perihilar streaking which may be due to periarterial lymphatic engorgement. TTN may also present in premature infants. In this group of infants, TTN and pulmonary edema may further complicate surfactant deficiency and increase the likelihood of requiring exogenous surfactant and ventilator support. With advancing gestation and in the late preterm infant, TTN increasingly contributes to the pathophysiology of respiratory distress when compared to surfactant deficiency [28].",

The difficulty of reporting incidence is in the inconsistency of defining pneumonia in infants less than 1 month of age. The majority of late onset pneumonias are diagnosed in premature infants and most were on ventilatory support at the time of diagnosis. A small single center study by Apisarnthanarak [30] showed 28% of ventilated infants developed ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and in 1986, Halliday [31] reported a 35% incidence of pneumonia in intubated patients with RDS. Despite efforts by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) there is still not a gold standard for diagnosing VAP [32, 33].

Microorganisms such as viruses (cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, entroviruses and influenza A), bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum), and protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii) are known causes of intrauterine pneumonia.

Gasping due to asphyxia and/or meconium aspiration may introduce organisms into the respiratory system or be a consequence of infection in the fetus. Other factors such as prematurity and maternal urinary tract infection have a major role in increasing the risk of neonatal pneumonia. Group B streptococcus [GBS] is one the major causes of pneumonia in the neonate [34]. Overt GBS sepsis is seen in 1% of colonized infants or 1\u20134/1000 live births if no intrapartum prophylaxis with antibiotics is given. Premature infants comprise one third of all infants with GBS bacteremia [39]. In 1993, committees of the American Academy of Pediatrics published guidelines for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of group B streptococcal positive mothers [40]. These guidelines were revised in 1997 and have proven successful to date with a significant decrease in GBS sepsis to 0.6 per 1000 births in 1998 [41]. In 2002 [42], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA revised the prevention of perinatal Group B streptococcal disease guidelines concentrating on prenatal screening, updated prophylaxis regimens, prenatal specimen collection, culture methods and susceptibility testing. In addition, the CDC argued against routine intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS colonized women delivering by planned cesarean section prior to the onset of labor or rupture of membranes. They suggested a lgorithms for management of patients at risk for preterm delivery as well as infants exposed to prophylaxis treatment. Unfortunately, other microorganisms known to cause early onset pneumonia have increased in importance since the implementation of the GBS guidelines. The common pathogens that may influence the infant in the immediate postpartum period are Escherichia coli, Kelbsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, H. influenzae, Group D streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and pneumococci. In addition, non-bacterial pneumonia may be seen in the early postnatal period such as caused by Candida [43, 44], viruses [45\u201347], and Chlamydia [48].",

In addition, fungal etiologies have been implicated. Infections are acquired mainly through skin colonization and breakdown, gastrointestinal translocation of organisms, and from the respiratory tract of family and care providers. The colonization of an infant in the intensive care unit with common or unusual flora can be due to a weak immune system, health care provider exposure, and interventions (endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, and multiple courses of antibiotics) [56\u201359].",

Isolation of bacteria or viruses from the trachea or the oropharynx does not necessarily correlate with invasive infection and may just reflect colonization. Radiographic studies may suggest a focal pneumonia, but this presentation is not common and atelectasis may be difficult to differentiate from infiltrate secondary to pneumonia. The work up for suspected neonatal pneumonia whether congenital, early or late is similar. Blood, and airway cultures (nasophayngeal or tracheal if intubated) should be obtained and may be positive for the same microorganism in the case of respiratory infection [58]. Sherman [62], showed that tracheal secretions with a positive Gram stain in relation to neonatal bacteremia had a 74% sensitivity and 47% positive predictive value and concluded that gram stain of tracheal secretions may be of practical value in the diagnosis of congenital bacteremia. Positive airway culture alone may be more suggestive of early than late onset pneumonia, however in neither case is it sensitive [63, 64]. In the case of late, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), Mayhall [65] reviewed the diagnostic procedures for VAP based on the CDC (1997) Guidelines [66], although, these guidelines were intended for adult patients and are not specific for the neonatal population. Isolated positive tracheal culture did not distinguish between bacterial colonization and respiratory infection [61]. Radiographic studies are frequently non-specific, and it is more common to find pleural effusions in bacterial and fungal infections. Other non-specific laboratory values such as C- reactive protein (CRP) and WBC counts, especially immature to mature neutrophils ratio (I/T) may aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia.",

Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), high I/T ratio (>0.2) and CRP (>1) have shown to have positive predictive value of bacterial sepsis [66, 67]. Leslie et al [68] showed high I/T, low total neutrophil counts and positive gram stain to be more consistent with early onset bacterial pneumonia than RDS. However, diagnostic difficulty remains and if the index of suspicion for sepsis is high, the accepted treatment route is antibiotics for 48 hours while awaiting culture results and following the above markers trends. It is also accepted to treat every infant who deteriorates from a respiratory standpoint especially if the infant was asymptomatic for the first 6 hours of life.",
