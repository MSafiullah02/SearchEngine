            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) has three strains with the following nomenclature PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3. PCV1 was first isolated from a contaminated porcine kidney PK-15 cell line and has no pathogenicity for pigs. PCV2 can cause clinical symptoms including postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), pneumonia, porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), and reproductive failure (Madson and Opriessnig 2011). PCV3 was identified as a new member of PCV in 2015 (Palinski et al. 2017), additional studies showed that PCV3 appeared in other countries (China, Poland, Brazil, Korea, Denmark, Italy and Spain) (Franzo et al. 2018a; Kim et al. 2018b; Shen et al. 2018; Stadejek et al. 2017; Tochetto et al. 2018). Specifically, the existence of PCV3 in pigs can be traced back to as early as 1996 in China according to early studies (Sun et al. 2018). Although the pathogenicity of PCV3 is currently debated, studies have shown that it has the potential to threaten the swine industry directly (Jiang et al. 2019) as well as to enhance pig susceptibility to other microorganisms (Chen et al. 2019; Li et al. 2018). Currently, the common difficulty for the study of PCV3 is that the virus cannot be isolated from cell lines. However, unraveling the characteristic of the virus is still ongoing by constructing virus-like particles (VLPs) based on genetic engineering technology which can be achieved without the virus. These VLP-based studies may provide new ideas leading to a better understanding of the PCV virus which will lead to potential treatments and diagnotics.",

Due to the increased safety and ease of use VLPs are preferable for development of serologic diagnostic tests. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on VLPs is widely used to measure antibodies or neutralizing epitopes (Almanza et al. 2008; Chao et al. 2019). For example, PCV2 VLPs are used as coating antigens to be able to detect serum neutralizing antibodies (SNAbs) in ELISA (Nainys et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016). Currently, PCV3 Cap proteins harvested from insect cells or E. coli have been used as antigens to detect PCV3-specific antibodies in an ELISA (Deng et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019).

Recombinant Cap protein was harvested by induction with 0.4 mM IPTG and incubation at 25 \u00b0C for 20 h with shaking. The results of SDS-PAGE showed wt-eCap (molecular weight ~ 25 kDa) was hardly expressed in E. coli, while opti-eCap (molecular weight ~ 25 kDa) can be expressed in a considerable level and opti-eCap-3 was dominant (Fig. 2). For the future research, the highest expressed soluble opti-eCap3 was selected and it can also specifically react with positive serum (Fig. 3a). Due to the complex composition of the supernatant, host proteins or subcellular organelles, it is impossible to see clear viral particles directly under the TEM (data not shown). Therefore, purification by chromatography is necessary. During the purification process, higher purity was preferred over yield rate. After the purification by IEC, SDS-PAGE results showed little heteroprotein bands (Fig. 3b), 10 nm particles can be clearly observed under the TEM (Fig. 3c). However, there were still some special-shaped impurities detected in the particles. In order to make the results more clear and useful for subsequent ELISA establishment, the purest sample had been obtained from the next SEC (Fig. 4a). Uniform particles without any impurities were observed under TEM (Fig. 4b). A large fraction of the particles were in an aggregate state. Therefore, we can confirm the expression of the opti-eCap successfully self-assembled into virus-like particles. Furthermore, the recombinant eCap(molecular weight ~ 21 kDa) also had a high level of expression in E. coli (Fig. 2) but there were only irregular aggregation of proteins observed in TEM (Fig. 4c). It means that removing the NSL may lose the ability of VLPs forming.\n\n\n",

Because of their ability in stimulating strong immune response and plentiful antibody production, they are regarded as candidates of novel vaccines. (Garcea and Gissmann 2004). VLPs provide more safety in use and the possibility of large scale production of vaccines with reproducible high quality results compared with traditional live-attenuated or inactivated virus vaccines (Noad and Roy 2003; Raghunandan 2011). Some VLPs, such as Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) VLPs, human papillomavirus (HPV) VLPs and Malaria VLP-base vaccines have already been clinically used for the prevention of infectious diseases (Kim and Kim 2017a). In recent years, the technology of expressing capsid protein (Cap) of PCV2 and self-assembly into virus-like particles (VLPs) has advanced, and can be used in multiple recombinant protein expression systems including baculovirus, yeast and E. coli (Liu et al. 2008; Nainys et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2016). Many commercial vaccines based on VLPs have effectively prevented the infection of PCV2 (Beach and Meng 2012). Similar to PCV2, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, in PCV3 genome. ORF2 encode the immunogenic Cap which is the sole structural protein of the viral coat (Palinski et al. 2017). Whether the idea of forming recombinant Cap (rCap) into VLPs is equally applicable to PCV3 is the main purpose in our research.",

But eCap cannot be eluted under any conditions even if the least hydrophobic filler was selected. Therefore, it is suspected that PCV3 VLPs are highly hydrophobic. This conclusion can also be derived from genetic analysis as the entire Cap gene contains many hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore high-purity particles exist in an aggregated form under the TEM, which also explained the observation that the target protein eluted at the first peak of sepharose 6FF column. Theoretically 10 nm particles should elute at the end of this gel. Virions have properties that tend to aggregate (Gerba and Betancourt 2017), the aggregate status may be changed by adjustment of the pH or salt concentration and type of cationic salt in suspension (Mattle et al. 2011). VLPs may also encounter the problem of aggregation due to their large size and complex structure, this can occur during the process such as during separation, purification and storage (Chen et al. 2015; Jezek et al. 2009; Kissmann et al. 2008; Shi et al. 2005).",

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on VLPs is widely used to measure antibodies or the neutralizing epitopes (Almanza et al. 2008; Chao et al. 2019). PCV2 VLPs as coating antigens can detect serum neutralizing antibodies (SNAbs) in ELISA (Nainys et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016). Some reports show that PCV3 infection in pigs do not present any significant clinical signs or symptoms and wild boars may also have susceptibility (Franzo et al. 2018b; Klaumann et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2017), thus it is particularly important to establish an effective antibody detection method to assess the PCV3 infection in pigs.",

Our lab is actively trying to rescue the virus through the method reported in this article. Without virus it is impossible to carry out immunization and challenge experiments to prove whether the VLPs have protective effect on PCV3 infection as a vaccine because the virus has not been successfully isolated to date. To provide another solution here we describe the establishment of a VLP-based I-ELISA for antibody detection. In this process, the choice of positive serum was extremely important. In addition to PCV3, the specific positive serum cannot be detected with other pathogens by PCR and ELISA. Active viremia indicates that the virus is in the infection stage. The VLPs can react specifically with such serum as the result of Western and ELISA experiments, which fully demonstrates the immunogenicity for PCV3.",

Subsequently, the VLP ELISA was successfully applied to the antibodies detection of 373 clinical serum samples from China collected in 2019, indicating that this method can be more widely applied to the epidemiological research of PCV3.",
