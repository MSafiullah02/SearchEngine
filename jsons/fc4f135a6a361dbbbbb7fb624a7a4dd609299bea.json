This novel influenza 2009 A/H1N1 virus contains a combination of swine, avian, and human influenza virus genes. In sharp contrast to H5N1 and SARS viruses which emerged from the Asian continent, H1N1 virus emerged from North America (Mexico). Many important infectious diseases persist on a knife-edge: rapid rates of transmission coupled with brief infectious periods generate boom-and-bust epidemic that court extinction [5] . Such violent epidemic behavior has been observed in measles [14] , cholera [33] , meningitis [25, 58] , and pertussis [49] , among others. Several distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the spread and outbreak dynamics of avian influenza virus.

Avian Influenza, commonly known as Bird Flu, is an epidemic caused by H5N1 Virus, that primarily affects birds such as chickens, wild water birds, ducks, and swans etc. On rare occasions, pigs and humans will also be affected with this virus. Migratory aquatic birds, most notably wild ducks, are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses that inhabit the intestines of these birds. Infection in domestic poultry is thought to occur due to contact with these aquatic/ wild birds. Fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds, providing a large pool of influenza viruses potentially circulating in bird populations. Avian Influenza is an infection caused by a virus known as orthomyxoviridae in virus classification. Influenza virus has only one species in it, which is called influenza A virus. Influenza A infects humans and animals such as birds, pigs, horses, and seals. When it infects birds, it is called avian influenza; when it infects pigs, it is called swine influenza, and so on. Typically, avian influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. But occasionally, avian influenza infects humans who have been in close contact with birds, with a rich pool of genetic and antigenic diversity that often leads to cross-species transmission. Wild birds worldwide carry these viruses in their intestine but usually do not get sick from them. However avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds including chickens, ducks, and turkeys very sick and kill them. Infected birds shed influenza viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, etc. Susceptible birds become infected when they come in contact with the contaminated surfaces. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or food) that have been contaminated with the virus [1, 14, 54] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2079, "end": 2082, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2086, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2090, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Influenza A in humans is mainly a respiratory virus that typically infects cells of the nose and throat, but it can infect lung cells. It spreads when an uninfected person touches contaminated surfaces or inhales viruses coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. The recent avian strain that has been infecting humans is called H5N1 (named for its surface glycoproteins). H5N1 kills a high percentage of people who become infected, but thus far, the virus does not seem to spread well from person to person. Scientists fear that a person already infected with a human influenza A virus may become infected with the avian influenza A. If infected with both viruses, a hybrid avian-human influenza A virus may be generated that has two features making it particularly dangerous for human: avian H and N glycoproteins, to which humans have never been exposed (thus the immune system cannot quickly recognize and control the virus), and RNA from the human virus (enabling the hybrid to spread easily from person to person).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) has been reported in several countries throughout Asia. Cases of Avian influenza A in birds have been confirmed in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Human cases of avian influenza have been reported in Thailand and Vietnam. During this outbreak investigation, it has been determined that avian influenza is spread from person to person. The current outbreak of avian influenza has prompted the killing of more than 25 million birds in Asia. In general the outbreak of an infectious disease is dependent upon three necessary conditions as the source of an infection, the route of transmission, and the herd susceptibility [32] . Other social and natural factors also play an important role in the transmission of infection, for example the control measures and the change in temperature. The source of infection that led to the outbreak is not clear. In some researcher's view migratory birds are thought to be carrying the virus [9, 40] . If migratory birds had brought the virus one would have expected outbreaks well before February as bird migrations were over by around November. So we consider in our problem the source of outbreaks of bird flu to be the transportation of infected poultry as globalization has turned the chicken into the world's number one migratory bird species. We have assumed that it is mainly due to the human activities of commerce and trade that spread this epidemic. We acquired some important information about bird flu such as the virus H5N1 is sensitive to temperature changes and the virus survives for shorter time at a high temperature. Also there are many effective control measures to block the virus transmission such as compulsory vaccination, culling of all infected or exposed birds [3] . Indeed, in the absence of such control mechanisms this avian influenza may pose a big threat to global health care [17, 29, 42, 45, 53, 61] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1017, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1814, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1936, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1940, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1944, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1948, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1952, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1956, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this section, we present some material that helps one to understand the avian influenza H5N1 virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Some Biological Preliminaries"}, {"text": "A virus, (an infectious agent that has DNA or RNA and protective covering) is a submicroscopic acellular particle that cannot survive in the absence of a living host cell.

They are covered over by lipid/lipoprotein envelope. The viral envelope has lipoprotein membranes that enclose nucleocapsids and nucleoproteins.

The diameter of each enveloped virus ranges from 50-120 nm and filamentous virions are 20 nm in diameter and 200-300 nm long. The genome is in the form of eight negative sense ssRNA fragments.

Viral proteins are made in the cytoplasm using the host cell's ribosome. In the cell cytoplasm the virus releases its nucleocapsids that further are transported into the nucleus, where mRNA synthesis and replication occurs. Once it enters the nucleus, viral endonuclease snips off. This snipped part of the host mRNA is used as a primer by the virus to synthesize its own mRNA. Next, viral RNA polymerase further extends the primer and makes a complementary (mirror image) plus (+) strand mRNA. Transcription results in eight primary transcripts/pre-mRNA that are further translated in the cytoplasm. The cells treat the viral mRNA like their normal mRNA and use them to make copies of viral proteins. The virus RNA is transcribed to messenger RNA in the nucleus. RNA replication occurs in the nucleus with the help of viral RNA polymerase that was also involved in transcription (see Fig. 9 .2). In the same manner, the (+) strand of RNA (e.g., cRNA) is synthesized, and is coated with nucleocapsid proteins soon after it is made. This plus strand is then used as a template to synthesize a new negative RNA strand followed by coating with nucleocapsid proteins. These can further serve as templates for replication, mRNA synthesis, or packaging into virion particles. The (\u00c0) strand RNA (e.g., vRNA) are transported into the cytoplasm, where other viral proteins assemble together and are packed into virion particles and, on maturity, buds off from the outer cell membrane and infect new cells.

Influenza virus type A is the most significant epidemiologically and the most interesting from an ecological and evolutionary stand point, because it is found in a wide variety of bird and mammal species [16, 55] and can undergo major shifts in immunological properties. Type B is largely confined to humans and very little is known about type C. Type A virus is responsible for causing Bird Flu, which was first found in Italy in 1878. Type A virus is further divided into subtypes based on differences in membrane proteins HA and NA, which are the most important targets for the immune system. The notation HhNn is used to refer to the subtype comprising the hth discovered HA proteins and the nth discovered NA protein. The subtype H5N1 virus of type A virus is the main cause of the bird flu [20, 26, 34, 43, 56] . Subtype is further divided into strains; each genetically distinct virus isolated is usually considered to be a separate strain [19, 47] . There are 16 types of HA surface proteins (which are named H1, H2, H3,. . .,H16) and nine types of NA surface proteins (which are named N1, N2,. . .,N9). An influenza virus always has one type of HA surface protein and one NA surface protein and it could be of any combination of H and N, e.g., H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H5N2, H5N8, and so on [33, 35] .

Infection can be transmitted from infected bird droppings, saliva, nasal secretions, feces, or blood. These viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature or a month at 32 F, and can survive at very low temperatures indefinitely.

At the same time, the poultry population in Hong Kong was also found to be infected with avian influenza caused by the same pathogenic strain. Studies determined that the infection occurred when the virus jumped directly from birds to humans due to close contact with infected poultry. A pandemic was averted by rapid mass killing/burning of over a million birds-the entire poultry population of Hong Kong [8, 46, 63] . For more than 2 years, the virus has ravaged poultry and caused human illness and death in many Southeast Asian countries and China. In December 2003, a highly pathogenic form of H5N1 caused another outbreak in poultry in South Korea [36] . Another human infection was confirmed in February 2004 when two fatal cases were reported in Hong Kong due to H5N1 [47] , followed by 112 cases (57 fatal [9, 10] and antiviral antibodies have been found in pigs in Vietnam [11] . The virus was infecting chicken and humans in northern Iraq by January 2006. In early February 2006 Nigeria became the first African nation to report the bird flu virus, with an outbreak at a large commercial poultry farm. In February 2006, many European countries, Egypt, and Iran found wild birds infected with H5N1 virus [20, 23, 26, 34, 37, 46] . These cases could be the result of new strains due to reassortant viruses, antigenic shift, or antigenic drift, as explained earlier. People are not immune to these different strains. Generally speaking, an individual has immunity to only those microbes or viruses to which they are earlier exposed. The possibility of dreadful new strains is thus worrying, as people either have no immunity or extremely delayed immunity depending upon the individual's health and age. However, many new harmless strains causing symptomless infections go unnoticed. It was noticed that Spanish flu was most lethal in young adults, who generally are most able to fight off severe infections. One theory why Spanish flu preferentially killed young people is because they are the one with robust and reactive immune systems and therefore were most likely to mount a self-destructive response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 509, "end": 512, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 513, "end": 516, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 918, "end": 921, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1321, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1325, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1329, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1333, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1337, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1341, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology and Pathology"}, {"text": "Avian influenza can result in immediate and severe disaster, for example the outbreak in USA in 1983-84 led to destruction of more than 17 million birds at a cost of nearly US$56 million [32] .

They analyzed the data on the peregrinations of more than half-a-million US dollar bills recorded over a 5-year period on an online bill-backing system and given a simple model that only depends upon two parameters. Since the poultry products are also imported and exported very frequently, to various countries, we can assume its transport to be very similar to the human movement. So the probability that infected poultry product is transported from the form may assume a distance r, for r larger than 10 km with \u03b2 close to 0.6. This distribution behaves like a power law. This function decreases as r grows larger, meaning that transportation of poultry over a long distance is less common than short ones. However it does not decrease, as fast as other common probability distributions, which means that transportation over long distances, are still common enough to have a significant effect. Poultry products make many short journeys, but the occasional long haul ensures that they disperse widely. 5.

Parameter A controls the initial possible number of outbreaks the epidemic may abort if A is too small and overflow if A is large. So there shall be a proper intermediate value for A. The parameter b denotes the general trend of the outbreaks, the total number of outbreaks will grow too rapidly to be practical if b is a big number and may be too flat if b is too small.

The probability of occurrence of outbreak in Indonesia is also very low even on the second day.

Immediate and effective control measures are of great importance in preventing the transmission of avian influenza. So it is challenging to study the problem from various angles, and develop deterministic, discrete and statisticalmathematical transmission models. Using mathematical modeling, Breban et al. [5] have investigated the role of environmental transmission for the pattern and persistence of avian influenza in wild waterfowl and demonstrated that indeed environmental transmission is a fundamental ingredient for the modeling of this epidemic. The persistence mechanism induced by environmental transmission raises novel problems of epidemic control since traditional strategies may prove ineffective in the presence of an environmental viral reservoir [50] . For a global outbreak of influenza to occur, three conditions must be met: a new virus subtype must arise, this subtype must be able to cause serious illness in the human, and it must spread easily from person to person-and continue to do so. The first two conditions have been met with H5N1 human infections. Scientists are working for better understanding of different influenza A strains with the hope of preventing the spread of this virus. One of the reasons for the difficulty in predicting outbreaks is that migratory wild birds, not virus infected human carry the H5N1 virus long distance [62] (one cannot totally rule out the chance of human carrying bird flu for long distances). Our ongoing investigations relate to the question as how to assess the actual control measures and assign the parameters in the model with proper numerical values. There is a need to strengthen the design of data collection and for advanced experimental facilities to understand the virus spread with respect to all seasons and food consumption patterns. Given the present situation, it is not easy for any government to predict accurately the timing and location of future avian influenza attacks; there is a vide scope to strengthen the databanks and to train relief teams to minimize economic loss, in the event that an outbreak occurs [48] . To complement these issues with public health side of research activities, the government could consider launching large-scale experimental projects to estimate various rates of spread of H5N1 in different geographical regions, and to come up with a comprehensive approach for effective control of an outbreak.
