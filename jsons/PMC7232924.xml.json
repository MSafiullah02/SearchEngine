While numerous therapeutic and preventative avenues are being investigated, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer a compelling treatment option. In recent months, there has been increased interest in the clinical trial sector for the use of MSC therapies in COVID-19 patients. MSCs have received particular attention because of their ability to inhibit inflammation and cytokine storms as demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo models [1, 2]. Early-stage studies of MSC treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models have reported improvements in the lung microenvironment, inhibition of the over-active immune system, promotion of tissue repair, protection of lung alveoli epithelial cells, prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and the preservation of long-term pulmonary function. MSCs also secrete molecules that are antibacterial [3], anti-viral [4] and analgesic [5].",

Similar to SARS in 2003, this infectious disease results in a high probability of ICU admission and mortality [6\u20138]. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes the recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by the virus spike protein and priming of the spike protein by the cellular transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitating host cell entry and spread [9\u201311]. Severe respiratory illness is a primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection because the ACE2 receptor is widely expressed on alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelial cells. Also, the alveolar cells are known to express TMPRSS2 [12]. Viral lung infection results in the generation of a cytokine storm, as defined by the rapid efflux of a large number of cytokines. The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines drive extensive lung tissue edema, air exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress, secondary infection and death in 0.7 to 17.3% of patients [13].",

In 1991, Caplan termed these cells mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their mesenchyme origin during embryonic development noting an ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes [29]. In response to the varying nomenclature used to characterize MSCs, in 2005 the International Society of Cellular Therapy (ISCT) proposed that these stromal cells be referred to as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells and the term be reserved for cells that meet the following criteria [30, 31]:Plastic adherence in standard culture conditions.Surface marker expression of CD105, CD73 and CD90.Lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79 or CD19 and HLA-DR.Differentiation potential toward osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro.",

The ASC\u2019s immunomodulation of dendritic cell differentiation has been shown to be more effective than BM-MSCs [63].

They showed reduced extravascular lung edema, improved lung endothelial barrier permeability and restoration of alveolar fluid clearance. The effect was mediated in part by the secretion of KGF which helped restore sodium dependent alveolar fluid transport [109]. Using ex vivo lung perfusion in human lungs that had been rejected for transplantation, Genai and colleagues demonstrated that microvesicles derived from human BM-MSCs also increased alveolar fluid clearance and improved airway and hemodynamic parameters compared to perfusion alone [110]. Alveolar fluid clearance is promoted by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and KGF repair can be facilitated by MSC derived microvesicles that transfer mRNA [111, 112].",

EVs comprise exosomes, microvesicles (MVs) and apoptotic bodies. MVs form directly by budding from the cell membrane and are 100 nm to 1000 nm in size. They are abundant in selectins, integrins, CD-40, phosphatidylserine and metalloproteinases. Apoptotic bodies are fragments of dying cells which form and are released in the extracellular space by plasma membrane budding during the apoptotic process. They are irregular in shape and are between 50 and 4000 nm in size. They are rich in DNA and histones [119]. Exosomes are vesicles of 20\u2013100 nm size with endosomal origin. The exosomes exist intracellularly within multivesicular bodies which fuse with the cell membrane and then are released into the extracellular space. EVs carry membrane proteins, cytosolic proteins, transcription factors, DNA, mRNA, rRNA, miRNA and various signal transduction molecules. They are rich in heat shock proteins, annexins, cytoskeletal proteins, signal transduction proteins and multivesicular body synthesis proteins. EVs allow intercellular information exchange via different mechanisms such as internalization, ligand-receptor interaction, secreted factors and fusion-mediated transfer of surface receptors, to name a few. Thus, the presence of EVs by themselves in health and disease may be detrimental or beneficial depending on the cell of origin, the cargo they carry and the information they relay [74].",

MVs were also shown to reduce neutrophil influx and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [111].

In these models, the mechanism of the repair process is attributed to inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 release, enhancing IL-10 secretion, decreasing IL-6 levels, increasing KGF, overexpression of angiopoietin-1, reprogramming of macrophage function and secretion of antimicrobial peptides [137, 138].",

Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) occurs in the majority of Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses [155\u2013161], as well as other breeds that are required to perform strenuous exercise in their athletic disciplines (e.g. barrel racing Quarter Horses). It can lead to progressively decreased athletic performance [155\u2013161]. EIPH causes persistent structural lung damage with fibrosis and vascular remodeling of the caudodorsal lung fields, as well as venous remodeling and occasional bronchiolar damage [156, 157, 159\u2013162]. This, in turn, leads to pulmonary hypertension, capillary stress failure and hemorrhage into the lung. There is substantial evidence of the ASC\u2019s ability to reduce inflammation, reduce fibrosis and repair damaged tissues [163\u2013166]. Therefore, ASCs were hypothesized to repair damaged vessels, prevent pulmonary capillary hemorrhage, reduce pulmonary hypertension and decrease perivascular inflammation and fibrosis in EIPH. All twelve horses treated with ASCs were able to race again without any prophylactic medications. Prior to treatment with ASCs, all 12 of the horses had obvious epistaxis after racing and veterinary confirmation of lung bleeding by tracheobronchoscopic (TBS) examination, despite having received pre-race prophylactic medications. Following treatment with ASCs, only 1 of 12 horses had epistaxis with exercise. Five of eight horses (62.5%) were confirmed Grade 0 EIPH (no bleeding) by post-race TBS examination. Two horses (25%) were confirmed Grade 1 EIPH, and one horse (12.5%) was confirmed Grade 2 EIPH on post-race TBS examination. Owner/Trainer performance evaluations following treatment with ASCs were reported on only six horses. Four were reported as significantly better, one as better, and one as unchanged. Again, all horses raced without prophylactic medications after treatment with ASCs and no treatment associated adverse events were report.",

Lalu et al. was the first to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that comprehensively summarized the safety of intravenous MSC administration in more than 1000 patients [168]. Their analysis was unable to detect an association between MSC treatment and the development of acute infusion related toxicity, organ system complications, infection, malignancy or death [168]. Allogeneic MSC doses up to 100 \u00d7 106 have not resulted in serious adverse events with follow-up greater than 1 year in patients with sepsis, ischemic heart disease, perianal fistula, spinocerebellar ataxia, rheumatoid arthritis or severe osteoarthritis [169\u2013176]. Safety and efficacy were also demonstrated in several human clinical trials of immune mediated inflammatory diseases [52\u201355, 177, 178]. Based upon numerous published human clinical trials, the intravenous administration of BM-MSCs appears to be safe.",

Very few adverse events have been reported that could be related directly to MSC therapy. One case of pulmonary thromboembolism was reported 4 weeks after intramyocardial stromal vascular fraction injection in a patient with New York Heart Association class II heart failure [203]. Henry et al. performed intramyocardial ASC injections in 17 chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with an average ejection fraction of 31% and two patients suffered possible TIA or stroke, but the cause could not be directly attributed to the procedure [204, 205]. These studies did not describe whether the cells were filtered before administration to ensure that the injected cells were single cell suspensions. Thromboembolic complication risk can be assumed to be higher when injecting clumped cells compared with single cell suspensions, particularly when performed in intramyocardial injections. In addition, the patients\u2019 underlying medical conditions must also be taken into account as they had a poor prognosis due to their severe cardiopulmonary disease.",

Gao et al. [61] conducted a randomized, double blind controlled trial on the safety and efficacy of 230 UC-MSC infusions for GVHD prophylaxis after HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation in 62 patients with hematologic malignancies. Infusions of 30 \u00d7 106 UC-MSCs/100 ml/month) were well tolerated without acute infusion related toxicity or adverse events. The incidence of cGVHD in UC-MSC treated group was significantly lower than the placebo control group (27.4% vs. 48.4%). Survival and disease recurrence did not differ at 51 month follow-up, suggesting that UC-MSC treatment did not increase the incidence of disease recurrence. Interestingly, analysis of a subset of CD4+ CD25+ CD127\u2212 regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD27+ memory B-lymphocytes was higher in the UC-MSC treated group although the proportion of total T cells and B cells remained unchanged. Wang et al. [216] conducted a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials to evaluate the safety of MSC prophylaxis of cGVHD in 365 patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Beneficial prophylactic effects were seen with high dose UC-MSCs but not with low dose BM-MSCs. Prophylactic MSC infusion significantly decreased the incidence of cGVHD without increasing the risk of infection or primary disease relapse. Further, MSC infusion did not impair the anti-tumor and anti-virus T cell responses.",

During the spring of 2013, a novel avian-origin Influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and spread among humans in China. The disease caused by this virus shares many similarities with COVID-19. Chen and colleagues conducted an open-label clinical trial in 61 patients infected with the H7N9 virus. All patients had moderate to severe ARDS. Seventeen patients consented to receive intravenous infusions of allogeneic menstrual blood MSCs after failure to improve with standard treatment and, in some cases, invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients were infused with 1x106 MSCs/kg bw, three to four times. No adverse MSC infusion-related events were noted in any of the patients. The clinical outcomes were compared with 44 patients matched with similar symptoms, laboratory tests and other baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the groups, except that the MSC treatment group had a higher incidence of severe circulatory disturbances prior to treatment. The MSC treated group demonstrated a significantly higher survival rate (82.4%) compared to the control group (45.5%). At discharge, significantly better laboratory test results (procalcitonin, creatinine, creatine kinase, prothrombin time and D-dimer) were noted in the MSC infusion group. At the 1 year followup, chest CT scans of the patients showed significant improvement in the MSC treatment group. At five-year follow-up, all tested survivors from the treatment group did not show any adverse effects of MSC treatment or decline in pulmonary function tests. These promising results support the belief that MSCs reduce the inflammatory effects associated with viral infection, induced cytokine storm and severe respiratory distress. Future placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials using a greater number of patients are desperately needed to validate these encouraging findings.",

The patients selected were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one displaying critically severe type, four patients exhibited severe types, and two with milder symptoms of disease. An additional three patients with severe types were enrolled for placebo control. Prior to MSC infusion, all of the patients displayed high fever, shortness of breath, low oxygen saturation and pneumonia. When symptoms worsened, the patients received 1 x106 UC-MSCs/kg bw intravenously and were closely followed for 14 days. Virtually all symptoms subsided within 2-4 days subsequent to MSC infusions with no adverse effects. Chest CT imaging demonstrated that pneumonia infiltration significantly subsided. The majority of patients tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test at a week or two after MSC infusion. They found that MSC could significantly improve the functional outcomes of 7 patients without any observed adverse effects. Although no short-term adverse effects were observed, long-term follow up after MSC administration will be necessary in future clinical studies.",

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying the improvement after MSC infusion appears to be the result of robust anti-inflammatory activity. Such processes include an increased number of peripheral lymphocytes, the decline in the C-reactive protein, and decrease of over-activated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells). Moreover, a group of CD14+ CD11c+ CD11bmid regulatory dendritic cell (DC) population increased after MSC treatment. In comparison to the placebo group, the MSC-infused patients demonstrated a decreased level of TNF-\u03b1, and concurrent elevation in the concentration of IL-10, suggesting an improved cytokine milieu. RNA-sequencing showed that infused MSCs were negative for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which implied that MSCs were free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that MSCs were involved in antiviral pathways. The results of these clinical studies in severely ill COVID-19-infected patients show that in vivo administration of MSCs may be a safe and effective approach for treating patients who are in pulmonary distress, including elderly patients with severe ARDS.",
