Controlling infectious diseases has been an increasingly complex issue in recent years. Vaccination is an important strategy for the elimination of infectious diseases  [7], [11], [16], [18]. Recently, pulse vaccination epidemic models have been the subject of intense theoretical analysis  [1], [10], [15], [19]. Theoretical results show that the pulse vaccination strategy can be distinguished from the conventional strategies in leading to disease eradication at relatively low values of vaccination  [1].",

For instance, some infected hosts can be properly detected and treated, isolated or removed, whereas others remain undetected and untreated. It is obvious that in such circumstances the length of the infectious periods and the levels of contagiousness for these detected and undetected hosts can significantly differ. Moreover, the behavior of a virus within a host may be different. Some infections, such as Hepatitis B, can have either a highly contagious and comparatively short acute infectious stage, or can persist within a host for a long time without apparent symptoms and having comparatively low level of contagiousness. This leads to the questions whether this diversity of the levels of contagiousness and the lengths of the infective period affects the system dynamics, and whether the classic compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, which postulate that all the hosts are identical, are adequate to describe the spread of an infection  [3].",

Other examples of viruses possessing multiple strains may be seen in corona viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  [22]. The presence of multiple strains adds greater complication to models of disease dynamics due to an increasing number of stages through different infection\u2013recovery combinatorics.

In the next section, we propose a two-delay disease Model with pulse vaccination and infectious Period. To prove the main results, we also give two lemmas. In Section  3, using the discrete dynamical system determined by the stroboscopic map, we establish sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of infection-free periodic solution. The sufficient conditions for the permanence of the model are obtained in Section  4. In particular, some results are obtained in Section  5 if there is only one infective compartment.

Here N(t) is the size of the total variable population at time t. We assume that after infection an individual immediately moves from the susceptibles compartment into one of the infective compartments and after a constant infectious period  [8] then into the recovered compartment.

We are left to prove there exist positive constants mS,mI and t0(t0  is sufficiently large) such that S(t)\u2265mS,I(t)\u2265mI for all t>t0.Firstly, from the first equation of system (2.3), we have S\u2032(t)\u2265\u03bb\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21\u03bbd+\u03b22\u03bbd)S(t). Considering the following comparison equations: {u2\u2032(t)=\u03bb\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21\u03bbd+\u03b22\u03bbd)u2(t),t\u2260nT,n\u2208N,u2(t+)=(1\u2212\u03b8)u2(t),t=nT,n\u2208N, by Lemma 3.1 and the comparison theorem  [3], we know that for any sufficiently small \u03b5~>0, there exists a t0 (t0 is sufficiently large) such that S(t)\u2265u2(t)>u2\u2217(t)\u2212\u03b5~\u2265\u03bb\u03bc+\u03b21\u03bbd+\u03b22\u03bbd((1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21\u03bbd+\u03b22\u03bbd)T)1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b8)e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21\u03bbd+\u03b22\u03bbd)T)\u2212\u03b5~\u2254mS>0. Now, we shall prove there exists an mI>0 such that I1(t)+I2(t)\u2265mI for all sufficiently large t>t0. For clarity, we prove it in the following two steps:\nStep 1. Since \u211c1\u2217>1 and \u211c2\u2217>1 there exist sufficiently small mI\u2217>0 and \u03b5\u00af>0 such that (4.2)\u03b21\u03b7p(1\u2212e\u2212d1\u03c41)\u2212d1>0,\u03b22\u03b7p(1\u2212e\u2212d2\u03c42)\u2212d2>0, where \u03b7=\u03bb\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217((1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)T)1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b8)e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)T)\u2212\u03b5\u00af.\nFor mI\u2217, there must exist a t1>0 such that I1(t1)+I2(t1)\u2265mI\u2217. Otherwise, I1(t)+I2(t)<mI\u2217 for all t>0. From the first equation of system (2.3), we have S\u2032(t)>\u03bb\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)S(t). Consider the following comparison equations: {u3\u2032(t)=\u03bb\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)u3(t),t\u2260nT,n\u2208N,u3(t+)=(1\u2212\u03b8)u3(t),t=nT,n\u2208N. By the same method, there exists t\u2217>0, for t>t\u2217, we have (4.3)S(t)\u2265u3(t)>u3\u2217(t)\u2212\u03b5\u00af\u2265\u03bb\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217((1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)T)1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b8)e\u2212(\u03bc+\u03b21mI\u2217+\u03b22mI\u2217)T)\u2212\u03b5\u00af\u2254\u03b7. The second and the third equations of system (2.3) can be translated into the following form: I1\u2032(t)+I2\u2032(t)=(\u03b21Sp(t)(1\u2212e\u2212d1\u03c41)\u2212d1)I1(t)+(\u03b22Sp(t)(1\u2212e\u2212d2\u03c42)\u2212d2)I2(t)+\u03b21e\u2212d1\u03c41ddt\u222bt\u2212\u03c41tSp(\u03be)I1(\u03be)d\u03be+\u03b22e\u2212d2\u03c42ddt\u222bt\u2212\u03c42tSp(\u03be)I2(\u03be)d\u03be.\nDefine a function V(t) as follows: V(t)=I1(t)+I2(t)\u2212\u03b21e\u2212d1\u03c41\u222bt\u2212\u03c41tSp(\u03be)I1(\u03be)d\u03be\u2212\u03b22e\u2212d2\u03c42\u222bt\u2212\u03c42tSp(\u03be)I2(\u03be)d\u03be. For t>t\u2217, the derivative of V(t) along the solution of system (2.3) is V\u2032(t)=(\u03b21Sp(t)(1\u2212e\u2212d1\u03c41)\u2212d1)I1(t)+(\u03b22Sp(t)(1\u2212e\u2212d2\u03c42)\u2212d2)I2(t)>(\u03b21\u03b7p(1\u2212e\u2212d1\u03c41)\u2212d1)I1(t)+(\u03b22\u03b7p(1\u2212e\u2212d2\u03c42)\u2212d2)I2(t). From (4.3), we obtain V\u2032(t)>0 for t>t\u2217, which implies that V(t)\u2192\u221east\u2192\u221e. This contradicts the boundedness of V(t). Hence, there exists a t1>0 such that I1(t1)+I2(t1)\u2265mI\u2217.\nStep 2. According to step 1, for any positive solution (S(t),I1(t),I2(t)) of system (2.3), we are left to consider two cases. First, If I1(t)+I2(t)>mI\u2217 for all t>t1, then our aim is obtained. Second, if I1(t)+I2(t)<mI\u2217 for some t>t1, we can choose h>0 and t0>max{t\u2217,t1+\u03c4} (t0 is demanded be sufficiently large) such that I1(t)+I2(t)\u2264mI\u2217,I1(t0)+I2(t0)=I1(t0+h)+I2(t0+h)=mI\u2217 and S(t)>\u03b7 for t\u2208[t0,t0+h]. Therefore, there exists a g(0<g<\u03c4) such that for t\u2208[t0,t0+g]\n(4.4)I1(t)+I2(t)\u2265mI\u22172. In this case, we shall discuss three possible cases in terms of the sizes of g,hand\u03c4:\nCase I. If h\u2264g<\u03c4, then it is obvious that I1(t)+I2(t)\u2265mI\u22172, for t\u2208[t0,t0+h].\nCase II. If g<h\u2264\u03c4, then from the second equation of system (2.3), we can deduce (4.5)I1(t)+I2(t)=\u03b21\u222bt\u2212\u03c41tSp(\u03be)I1(\u03be)e\u2212d1(t\u2212\u03be)d\u03be+\u03b22\u222bt\u2212\u03c42tSp(\u03be)I2(\u03be)e\u2212d2(t\u2212\u03be)d\u03be. By (4.3), (4.4), (4.5), we have (4.6)I1(t)+I2(t)>\u03b21\u222bt0t0+gSp(\u03be)I1(\u03be)e\u2212d1(t\u2212\u03be)d\u03be+\u03b22\u222bt0t0+gSp(\u03be)I2(\u03be)e\u2212d2(t\u2212\u03be)d\u03be>(\u03b21e\u2212d1\u03c4\u2212\u03b22e\u2212d2\u03c4)\u03b7pgmI\u22172\u2254mI\u2217\u2217 for t\u2208[t0,t0+h].\nCase III. If g<\u03c4<h, we shall consider the following two cases, respectively.\nCase IIIa. For t\u2208[t0,t0+\u03c4], it is easy to obtain I1(t)+I2(t)>mI\u2217\u2217 from (4.6).\nCase IIIb. For t\u2208[t0+\u03c4,t0+h], we claim I1(t)+I2(t)>mI\u2217. Otherwise, we suppose there is a t\u00af\u2208[t0+\u03c4,t0+h], such that I1(t)+I2(t)>mI\u2217\u2217 for t\u2208[t0,t\u00af], and I1(t\u00af)+I2(t\u00af)=mI\u2217\u2217. From (4.2), (4.3), (4.5), we have I1(t\u00af)+I2(t\u00af)=\u03b21\u222bt\u00af\u2212\u03c4t\u00afSp(\u03be)I1(\u03be)e\u2212d1(t\u00af\u2212\u03be)d\u03be+\u03b22\u222bt\u00af\u2212\u03c4t\u00afSp(\u03be)I2(\u03be)e\u2212d2(t\u00af\u2212\u03be)d\u03be>\u03b21\u03b7pd1(1\u2212e\u2212d1\u03c4)mI\u2217\u2217+\u03b22\u03b7pd2(1\u2212e\u2212d2\u03c4)mI\u2217\u2217>mI\u2217\u2217, which is contradictory to I1(t\u00af)+I2(t\u00af)=mI\u2217\u2217. Therefore, the claim holds true.Since t0 is arbitrary, there exists mI\u2254min{mI\u22172,mI\u2217\u2217}>0, such that I1(t)+I2(t)\u2265mI for all t>t0. The proof is completed.\n",

            "text": "Some infectious diseases possess multiple parallel infectious stages such as Hepatitis B. This leads to the diversity of the levels of contagiousness and the lengths of the infective period which affect the system dynamics. In view of these facts and based on pulse vaccination, an epidemic model with two parallel infectious stages and time delays and pulse vaccination is proposed. We introduce four thresholds \u211c\u22171,\u211c\u22172,\u211c1\u2217 and \u211c2\u2217 and further obtain that the disease will be extinct if \u211c\u22171<1 and \u211c\u22172<1, and persistent if \u211c1\u2217>1 and \u211c2\u2217>1. Corollary 3.1, Corollary 4.1 show that under condition that \u03b8>max{\u03b8\u22171,\u03b8\u22172} the disease will fade out, and if \u03b8<min{\u03b81\u2217,\u03b82\u2217}, the disease will be uniformly persistent. Our results indicate that a larger pulse vaccination rate will lead to the eradication of a disease. Furthermore, two thresholds \u211c\u22171 and \u211c\u22172 show that the diversity of the contagiousness affects the basic properties of these models.",

(1) Corollary 3.1, Corollary 5.2 display the conditions of the eradication of the disease when there are two infective compartments and only one infective compartment, respectively. Obviously, the threshold max{\u03b8\u22171,\u03b8\u22172} is larger than \u03b8\u2217, which implies that a larger fraction of susceptibles should be vaccinated against the disease if multiple strains coexist. (2) Fig. 2(a) indicates that the number of the infected decreases as the probability ratio (P1:P2) of an infected individual to enter the two infective compartments increases when the other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 1. (3) During the above investigation, we find that whether the disease will be extinct or not is dependent on the parameter p in the nonlinear incidence \u03b2ISp which governs the transmission of the infection (see Fig. 2(b)).",
