As a result, it is essential to assess the intersectional and gendered vulnerabilities in health emergencies. In addition, given the gender-skewed landscape of power and decision-making in global health, it is also critical to outline women\u2019s leadership and role in such contexts.",

This is similarly the case for women from other under-represented groups such as indigenous people, in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) and sexual minorities or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) individuals.",

Additionally, women constitute a majority of workers in the non-agricultural informal sector7\u2014leaving them vulnerable to loss of livelihood and economic insecurity due to the disruptive \u2018fearonomic effects\u2019 of pandemics.8 The socioeconomic impact of disasters and crises is further exacerbated for women in minority and lower income groups.9 As mothers, women are more likely to be responsible for nearly 1.5 billion children who are out of school in times of widespread school disruptions\u2014drastically impacting their ability to be financially independent.10\n",

Additionally, evidence from the business sector highlights the strong association of gender diversity with innovative and ethical decision-making, and with reduction in fraud and cognitive biases.12\u201315 Greater gender representation brings with it diverse perspectives and approaches to problem solving, resulting in faster and better quality decisions.16 17\n",

Interventions that work in high-income countries may not work elsewhere. For example, border closures will have limited applicability in countries with porous borders, and top-down interventions may be less effective in countries where the community trust in governments is lower, particularly in areas where women have been mistreated by police and armed forces. Insights from the implementation of interventions in LMICs (for COVID-19 and previous disease outbreaks) and country-specific context that takes into perspectives of women, and vulnerable communities can greatly inform the COVID-19 response and recovery. A diverse decision-making body for health security and COVID-19 response, with expertise from LMICs, women, patient groups, indigenous people and the LGBTQI community, will limit group-think, boost problem solving, accountability and learning to unleash overlooked and innovative context-appropriate solutions to global challenges.",
