These effects have been tempered by the increase in world food production achieved in recent decades. Unfortunately, differentiating the effects of global warming and climate change on the rest of the factors that affect the world agricultural and livestock production is not easy, but studies have shown that increases in corn and wheat production since 1980 would be a 5% higher in the absence of the effects of climate change. If the rest of the factors were invariant, the high levels of carbon dioxide (the main driver of global warming) would be possible to increase the production of rice, soy, wheat and other crops. We must bear in mind that the climate change will significantly affect the duration and quality of the growing season. Nor should we forget the damage to crops that will increase dramatically due to droughts, floods or forest fires that will become increasingly frequent and intense phenomena.",

As the standard of living increases, the population tends to demand greater amounts of food (especially meat), what suggests a future of increasingly volatile food prices.

More pessimistic assessments claim that the overall contribution of food production to atmospheric emissions can reach 30%. Therefore, effectively restricting the long-terms effects will require making food production more resistant to the climate and the achievement of significantly lower carbon footprints. Countries and their citizens suffer unequally the threat of food supply. Some countries, which lose arable land and fisheries, lack the resources to maintain food security at a reasonable cost.

By combining information on climate changes with soil- and crop-specific evapotranspiration models, they predicted the potential amounts of irrigation water needed to prevent crop failures up to the year 2070. In a scenario of increasing temperatures, the amount of groundwater available for agricultural practices in the future will be inadequate. Hence the importance of computational methods with a view to estimating irrigation requirements under the changing climate conditions.",

They examined differences in infrastructure requirements associated to irrigation type (e.g., rice and surface irrigation) and geographical constraints potentially affecting the selected irrigation infrastructure (e.g., surface irrigation is unsuitable for undulating slopes). By using predictive models, they concluded that substantially reducing the surface-irrigated area in western USA \u2014by at least 40%\u2014 would be the only way of keeping the irrigation depth at baseline climate. Hence, additional solute ions will be required to supplement changes in irrigation infrastructure and sustain USA agriculture at its present levels without even considering the increased food needs projected for the growing global population.",

This will require developing new agricultural practices, introducing other crops and animal varieties, and applying the principles of integrated pest management to help curb their spread. It may also be necessary to consider using biological agents to fight pests or using introducing pest- and diseases-resistant crops and livestock varieties. Although grain legumes possess various sources of insect resistance, widespread adoption of large-scale measures on insect-resistant crops has so far been constrained by limited efforts in the production and distribution of resistant seeds (Sharma et al., 2010). Grain legume pests can be managed efficiently through cultural manipulation and their environment through intercropping, population monitoring, modification of agricultural systems in order to significantly increase the activity of the natural enemies of a certain cultivation, the use of natural essential oils and biopesticides, either alone or in combination with traditional pesticides, cultivation of resistant varieties of insects obtained by conventional genetic reproduction or genetic engineering, and implementation of applications adapted to the specific needs of synthetic pesticides. However, the relative efficiency of some pest management strategies (particularly those based on bio-pesticides or natural plant products) may be considerably reduced by a hot climate. In addition, genotypes can be expected to interact more strongly with the medium to express resistance to pests, and this would require greater efforts in identifying sources of resistance. This would allow the development of integrated pest management packages that can be used successfully under the conditions predicted for the future.",

The adaptation and mitigation strategies are based on the peculiar characteristics and interactions of fisheries and aquaculture within the framework of feasible policy instruments. Strategies and policy measures need to be evolved to combat the observable and projected impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture in order to protect the livelihoods of the fishing communities and food security. The response will depend mainly on the characteristics of the fisheries and the adaptive capability of the communities. However, each country needs adaptive and mitigation strategies that will improve the management of the fisheries and aquaculture, protect the integrity of the aquatic ecosystems, respond to the opportunities and threats on livelihoods and food security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (FAO, 2018a,b).",

Many wild plant species used in domestic plant breeding are threatened by extinction (Jarvis et al., 2010). Food system activities, including food production and transport, and food waste storage in landfills, produce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Livestock, which is the greatest contributor, accounts for an estimated 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities (Gerber et al., 2013), and meat from ruminants is especially emission-intensive (Tilman & Clark, 2014).",

            "text": "World leaders have agreed that the average global temperature should not rise by more than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels if the most catastrophic climate change scenarios are to be avoided. Even if this goal is fulfilled, many climate impacts such as sea level rise are likely to remain for centuries (IPCC, 2014b). Imagine a scenario in 2050 where societies have transitioned away from coal and natural gas to wind, solar and other renewable sources of energy. In this scenario, public policy and infrastructure investments will have turned walking, cycling and public transit the most accessible and popular forms of transportation and air travel will be used only as a last resort. In this otherwise best-case scenario, if global trends in meat and dairy intake continue, our likelihood of staying below the 2\u00b0C threshold will still be extremely low (Kim et al., 2015). This is why urgent, dramatic reductions in meat and dairy consumption, together with substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, transportation, and other sources, are crucial to avoid catastrophic climate changes. The responsibility for eating lower on the food chain falls most heavily on countries such as the US, which is the greatest per capita consumer of meat and dairy. Changing diets on an international scale will require more than simply re-educating consumers; in fact, national policies will have to provide increasing support for plant-centric diets (Kim et al., 2015). Strategies for improving resilience to climate change and extreme conditions should be anticipated in all production management areas (Table 2\n).",
