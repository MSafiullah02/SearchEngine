This attracted the attention of natural language processing researchers. Among them, those who study the language of individuals in relation to their mental health conditions. Social media data has been identified as an emerging opportunity for revolutionizing in-the-moment measures of a broad range of people\u2019s thoughts and feelings [16]. Several studies focusing on mental health understanding through social network data have been conducted using Twitter1 texts. Coppersmith et al. [9] presented a method for gathering data for a range of mental illnesses along with proof-of-concept results that focus on the analysis of four mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Their ultimate goal was to enable the ethical discussion regarding the balance between the utility of such data and the privacy of mental health related information. Later on, Coppersmith et al. [10] released a Twitter dataset of users who have attempted suicide, matched by neurotypical control users. Language modeling techniques were employed to classify these users, along with open government data to identify quantifiable signals that can relate them to psychometrically validated concepts associated to suicide. Nadeem et al. [18] used the same dataset to predict Major Depressive Disorder among online personas based on a Bag of Words approach and several statistical classifiers. More recently, Vioul\u00e8s et al. [24] combined natural language processing features with a martingale framework to detect Twitter posts containing suicide-related content. The results were comparable to traditional machine learning classifiers.",

The release of the dataset was coupled with some preliminary results on their classification. The same research group included exact temporal spans that relate to the date of diagnosis, in an attempt to show that this type of diagnosis is not static [17]. Another Reddit dataset recently released by Cohan et al. [8], based on which authors investigated extended self-diagnoses matching patterns derived from mental health-related synonyms with focus on nine different mental health conditions. De Choudhury et al. [13] applied a logistic regression classifier that led to high accuracy results in order to predict suicidal ideation in Reddit users. One of the first demonstration of suicidice risk assesment through Reddit posts, matched with clinical knowledge was very recently reported by Shing et al. [23].",
