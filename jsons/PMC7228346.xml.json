Examples of bat\u2010borne zoonotic viruses include rabies and rabies\u2010related lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses such as Hendra (HEV) and Nipah virus (NiV), filoviruses including Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), and coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. The recent intensification of viral surveillance (Table 1) in bats and advancements in pathogen detection techniques have enabled the identification of more than 200 bat\u2010borne viruses (Moratelli & Calisher, 2015), with this number actively increasing (Chen et al., 2014). Despite the growing diversity described, only a small percentage of these viruses have spilt over into other animals and humans, resulting in disease.",

Several environmental and anthropogenic factors have been considered as potential drivers of zoonotic disease emergence from wildlife species, including bats (Plowright et al., 2015). A key example of this is the rapid human population growth observed globally, consequently leading to large scale agricultural intensification, deforestation and bat bushmeat hunting (Pernet et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2017). These factors not only lead to habitat destruction and species decline but also to allow for increased contact between humans and wildlife species. As such, additional opportunities arise for spillover, leading to a higher probability that more of the bat\u2010borne viral diversity could spillover in the future.",

More than 70% of bat species are insectivorous, while others are frugivorous, carnivorous or sanguivorous. Of more than 1300 bat species documented globally (Simmons et al., 2008; Fenton & Simmons, 2015), at least 20% occur on the African continent, predominantly in the sub\u2010Saharan regions, and a few on the northern African coast (ACR, 2018). A large number of these African bat species have been the focus of several research studies focused on bat\u2010borne zoonoses as well as viral surveillance. The Chiropteran order was divided into two suborders: the Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera (Dobson, 1875) with the Megachiroptera including the family Pteropodidae (frugivorous bats) and the Microchiroptera comprising of all the other families of bats (predominantly insectivorous bats) (Koopman, 1994). This taxonomic classification has changed to incorporate the recognition of two separate lineages: Yinpterochiroptera (Pteropodiformes) which includes the Rhinolophidae (horseshoe insectivorous bats) and Pteropodidae, and Yangochiroptera (Vespertilioniformes) which is comprised of all the other families (Springer, Teeling & Stanhope, 2001; Van den Bussche & Hoofer, 2004; Hutcheon & Kirsch, 2006). For the purpose of this review, bats will loosely be referred to as frugivorous bats (Pteropodidae) or insectivorous bats (other bat families on the African continent).",

Longevity varies significantly between species, with the longest life span recorded in a Brandt\u2019s bat (Myotis brandtii) from Siberia of approximately 41 years based on recapture data (Podlutsky et al., 2005). With increased longevity, bats provide a stable environment for sustainable persistent virus replication and survival, eliminating the need for a rapid viral replication strategy. Additionally, prolonged survival allows for multiple horizontal and vertical transmission events through several generations, thus permitting virus maintenance within populations over time (Olival et al., 2017).",

Gestation varies from 1.5 to 7 months, but averages around two months with most species producing a single pup per litter (Wilson, 1997). Bats distributed in areas with less seasonal variation and year\u2010round food availability generally reproduce biannually or more (polyestrous), as is typical in equatorial areas, compared with only once a year (monoestrous) in more temperate regions. A prime example is the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Africa, where a single birthing pulse is noted in South Africa (Jacobsen & Du Plessis, 1976) compared with biannual pulses in Uganda (Bernard & Cumming, 1997). Bat maternity colonies have also been reported to act as viral amplifiers (Dietrich et al., 2015). Bat species that roost at high densities undergo patterns of seasonal breeding resulting in a large influx of susceptible individuals, initially protected by maternal antibodies with waning of protection (3\u20106 months) resulting in increased viral transmission and circulation among susceptible hosts (Plowright et al., 2008; Amman et al., 2012).",

Roost choice is influenced by species, season and sex of individuals. The use of man\u2010made structures results in increased opportunities for contact with humans, whereby exposure to bat\u2010borne viruses through contaminated excreta is likely. Caves, in particular, offer the opportunity for a large number of bats to co\u2010roost and occupy the same caves throughout a year (Chege, Schepers & Wolfaardt, 2015). The gregarious nature of some bat species leads to the formation of assemblages of individuals within roosts that may number in the tens to millions, with anything in between. These highly dense populations result in constant close contact between individuals due to social behaviours such as mating, grooming or fighting. This increases contact rates with body fluids including saliva, blood, faeces and urine. As such, dense roosting aggregations facilitate high rates of intra\u2010 and interspecies transmission of viruses (Luis et al., 2015). Viral maintenance within species that roost in smaller, less\u2010dense populations is not as clearly defined and not well investigated.",

The African straw\u2010coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is associated with long\u2010distance migrations, crossing country boundaries as they migrate from southern and sub\u2010Saharan Africa and aggregate in numbers of more than 5 million at Kasanka National Park in Zambia to give birth (Richter & Cumming, 2006). Similarly, the Egyptian rousette has been recorded to migrate as far as 500 km in South Africa (Jacobsen & Du Plessis, 1976). Increased contact with other animal species during these movements enhances the potential for interspecies virus transmission (Wang, Walker & Poon, 2011) in addition to long\u2010distance dissemination of viruses across large geographical regions. Global warming has also been hypothesized to result in future changes in bat species distribution and introduction of diseases into new areas (Sherwin, Montgomery & Lundy, 2013; Hayes & Piaggio, 2018).",

            "text": "The topic of bat immunology has been explored in recent years, with current conclusions indicating that a number of interacting features are involved in combating viral infections. Bats have both an innate immune response and adaptive immune response, with similar immune organs, tissues, cells and immunoglobulin types as compared to other mammals (Schountz et al., 2017), with some unique differences. Bat genome data indicate evolution of the mitochondrial DNA damage and repair pathways coinciding with the timing of the evolution of flight (and increase metabolic cost) in bats (Zhang et al., 2013; O\u2019Shea et al., 2014). This results in significantly higher metabolic rates in bats, as compared to other hyperactive mammals, and associated higher body temperature. This increase in body temperature, similar to a typical immune\u2010mediated febrile response (O\u2019Shea et al., 2014), was suggested as a viral control mechanism. The \u2018flight as fever\u2019 hypothesis proposes that bat\u2010borne viruses may be more tolerant of fever responses, and therefore appear to be more virulent when encountered in a non\u2010natural host, such as humans. This has not been substantiated by any experimental evidence and has been contradicted for filoviruses (Miller et al., 2016). In addition, studies indicated that the type I interferon (IFN) system is continually expressed resulting in upregulation of additional immune genes that control viral replication (Zhou et al., 2016). Bats also have a combinatorial diversity of immunoglobulin segments, up to five times more segments than reported for humans (giving rise to many more different antibody molecules). This leads to a higher na\u00efve immunoglobulin repertoire (combination of all antibody specificities in an individual) that allows for a more effective response to infection (Schountz et al., 2017). In contrast, a recent study concluded that the genome analysis of the Egyptian rousette bat indicated crucial differences between the antiviral mechanisms of bats and other mammals (Pavlovich et al., 2018) and that the ability to control viral infection is less due to enhanced potency of the antiviral defences and more associated with inhibitory immune states (tolerance). Studies are usually focused on a single bat species that complicates interpretation of results and extrapolating findings to all members of the Chiroptera order. The lack of bat immunological reagents and defined bat models are a major limitation in studies with several aspects of the bat immune system not being investigated at all. Other differences not related to the immune system can also contribute towards reservoir status, including physiological, behavioural and metabolic characteristics.",

            "text": "Lastly, a few other characteristics such as echolocation, hibernation and torpor have been suggested as contributory factors, though not all bats share these characteristics. Insectivorous bats are known to echolocate, while pteropodids do not. However, certain exceptions have been reported in fruit bat species (Rousettus spp.), who produce ultrasounds by tongue clicking (Nowak et al., 1994). Echolocation has been postulated as a mechanism for potential viral spread (Calisher et al., 2006), representing a sneeze and expulsion of droplets of oropharyngeal fluids, mucus or saliva that could act as a transmission route. Hibernation and torpor are hypothesized to aid in viral persistence and subsequent viral reactivation due to decreased metabolic and immunological activity (Gerow et al., 2019). There are currently few reports of torpor in African bat species; however, it may be more common than currently documented (Geiser & Stawski, 2011).",

However, many of the aforementioned factors do not apply to rodents, as there is rapid population turnover, and their life spans are much reduced, non\u2010volant, etc. Thus, although these bat life traits might contribute to some extent, they should not be considered as mutually exclusive and may play intricate roles along with yet unknown factors in supporting the high viral diversity observed in bats.",

This does not provide information on the maintenance or pathogenicity of the agent within the host population. A major concern is also the potential for cross\u2010reactivity with other related viral species. For most viral families, nucleic acid detection tests (PCR assays), that are based on degenerate consensus broadly reactive primers, targeting conserved partial viral genome regions, are available. Such assays, however, require that the sequence information of newly detected viruses share a certain degree of similarity to the previously characterized viruses in the genus or family, and will therefore be less likely to detect highly divergent sequences that may represent novel viruses. Unbiased sequence\u2010independent methods such as next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have also gained more popularity and are excellent tools for novel pathogen discovery. Viruses identified might be part of the natural microflora present in bats, be a bat pathogen, or even as coincidental spillovers from other species \u2013 thus their detection should not immediately be considered as evidence for the designation of bats as reservoirs to those viruses.",

These viruses have positive\u2010sense RNA genomes and belong to four genera, namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Wong et al., 2019). Human coronaviruses (HCoV) such as HCoV229E, HCoVNL63, HCoVOC43 and HCoVHKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus are respiratory pathogens transmitted primarily through aerosols. A number of animal\u2010infecting coronaviruses such as feline, bovine and porcine coronaviruses result in gastroenteritis and are thus transmitted via a faecal\u2013oral route. Coronaviruses are known to frequently undergo recombination and mutation events, conferring fitness advantages to new variants (Tao et al., 2017). Global surveillance for coronavirus diversity in bats has rapidly expanded in the last 17 years and can be mostly linked to emerging coronavirus disease outbreaks. SARS coronavirus emerged in China in 2002 and MERS coronavirus in 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula. Both pandemics resulted in significant morbidity and mortality (10% and 35%, respectively) among human populations, which were exacerbated by global travel (Berry, Gamieldien & Fielding, 2015).",

The rapid onset of a novel viral agent, with potential animal exposures of nearly all index patients, leads to suspicions of an emerging zoonosis (Cui, Li & Shi, 2019). Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) were the first animal hosts from which SARS coronavirus was detected in the live animal markets of China (Guan et al., 2003). These hosts were likely infected by another animal in the market (Cui et al., 2019), which was suggested to be the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus) genus, due to the detection of viruses sharing genetic similarity to SARS from these bats (referred to as SARS\u2010related viruses) (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005). Horseshoe bats were further shown to host a large diversity of SARS\u2010related viruses (Hu et al., 2017), though these viruses shared low similarity to SARS coronavirus within the spike gene region \u2013 which is essential for recognition and attachment to host receptors (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005). Eleven years of continued surveillance within Chinese horseshoe bat species to better understand the emergence of SARS and genetic diversity of SARS\u2010related viruses allowed for the identification of viruses from horseshoe bat species sharing near\u2010identical similarity to human SARS (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016). These similar viruses were even capable of using the same binding receptor as human SARS coronavirus, a feature the majority of bat\u2010borne SARS\u2010related viruses were lacking (Ge et al., 2013) suggesting direct infection of humans and other hosts during the outbreak in 2002 was possible (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017). No new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, though the continued presence of various recombinant SARS\u2010related strains in horseshoe bat populations makes re\u2010emergence possible.",

The virus was first identified from a man in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012), through retrospective investigations of infections in Jordan confirmed an even earlier emergence of MERS (de Groot et al., 2013). International global travel activities have since resulted in the spread of MERS to several other countries, though the virus requires sustained contact to transmit between people ((Berry et al., 2015). Many of the index cases of MERS had direct contact with dromedary camels, from which near\u2010identical viruses were detected (Memish et al., 2014). MERS prevalence has since been shown to be widespread among dromedary camel populations of the Middle East and Africa (Dighe et al., 2019), and MERS antibodies have been detected in camel sera collected even as far back as the 1980s (Reusken et al., 2014). Zoonotic MERS from camels has only been reported from the Arabian Peninsula (Chu et al., 2018). The association of bats with the emergence of MERS has been less well described. During the initial search for the zoonotic origins of MERS, bats were investigated due to shared genome similarities of MERS with previously identified Asian bat coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2006). A short coronavirus sequence (190 nt) sharing 100% identify within a conserved gene region of human MERS coronaviruses was identified from an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), collected in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013a). No additional genome regions could be recovered, and the absence of additional genetic information makes further conclusions challenging. A number of coronaviruses more distantly related to MERS have been reported from various bat species, and this is further discussed below.",

            "text": "The implication of bats acting as possible progenitors of emerging coronaviruses prompted global surveillance activities from which large diversities of bat coronaviruses have been identified (from diverse bat species). These viruses display host genus specificity, though cross\u2010species transmissions are also frequently observed (Anthony et al., 2017b; Leopardi et al., 2018). The vast amount of data has led to the hypothesis that bats host the genetic diversity of the Alpha\u2010 and Betacoronavirus mammalian infecting genera (Woo et al., 2012). Furthermore, the emergence of novel coronaviruses is strongly linked to high diversity present in host populations, frequent mutation and recombination events that may lead to novel viral strains which are capable of adaptation to new hosts (Hu et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017b). Bat coronaviruses are predominantly excreted in faecal material, which creates opportunities for exposure to other individuals and species, and facilitates easy transmission throughout bat populations. Bat coronaviruses have also been reported at low frequencies in oral swabs, urine (Mendenhall et al., 2017) and tissues such as rectum and intestine (Geldenhuys et al, 2018), lung (Shehata et al., 2016), spleen and brain (Anindita et al., 2015).",

These studies reported highly diverse and novel coronavirus species, as well as a number of coronaviruses related to known human coronaviruses. Viral nucleic acids related to HCoV229E (Duvinacovirus subgenus) have been reported from several species within the roundleaf bat (Hipposideros) genus (Fig. 1a) (Pfefferle et al., 2009; Maganga et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2015; Waruhiu et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017b; Bourgarel et al., 2018). Genetic comparisons of similar coronaviruses of bats, alpacas and camels to HCoV229E have suggested that camelids may historically have acted as intermediate (Table 1) hosts during the emergence of HCoV229E (Corman et al., 2015). Relatives of HCoVNL63 (Setracovirus subgenus) have thus far only been identified from Trident bat species (Triaenops) (Fig. 1b) (Tao et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017b). Interestingly, it has been suggested that HCoVNL63 may have risen from a recombinant progenitor, created by recombination of separate clades of bat\u2010borne coronaviruses, similar to both 229E\u2010related and NL63\u2010related viruses (Tao et al., 2017).",

Studies from Africa have reported bat\u2010borne MERS\u2010related viruses from the Vespertilionidae family that are currently the most closely related to human and camel MERS viruses. The viruses have been identified from the Cape serotine bat (Neoromicia capensis) in South Africa and the African pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus hesperidus) in Uganda (Fig. 1d) (Ithete et al., 2013; Anthony et al., 2017a; Geldenhuys et al., 2018). Though surveillance for MERS has not been extensively performed in other species of these genera, host genus specificity would suggest that similar viruses may be circulating (Geldenhuys et al., 2018). Indeed, Pipistrellus (P. pipistrellus, P. nathusii and P. pygmaeus) populations in various European countries (Netherlands, Romania and Ukraine) confirm circulation of MERS\u2010related viruses within this genus even in distant geographical regions (Annan et al., 2013). These studies represent initial investigations identifying hosts of MERS\u2010related viruses, but significant further research is required to improve the understanding of the emergence of MERS coronaviruses.",

This new virus, Marburg virus (MARV), has since been documented in various parts of Africa (Fig. 2a) (Olival & Hayman, 2014) and causes disease in both humans and nonhuman primates. The two most significant human outbreaks were reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1998\u20132000 and Angola in 2004\u20132005 with 128 and 227 human fatalities (Brauburger et al., 2012). Although circumstantial evidence linked human outbreaks to bats, the reservoir and epidemiology of MARV remained undetermined for more than two decades after its discovery. In 1999, MARV RNA was detected in bats for the first time, including the Egyptian rousette bats, eloquent horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus eloquens) and a greater long\u2010fingered bat (Miniopterus cf. inflatus) captured in DRC (Swanepoel et al., 2007). In the following years, MARV was detected and isolated from Egyptian rousette bats in Eastern Africa (Towner et al., 2009) with more recent detections also from the northern regions of South Africa (Paweska et al., 2018). The Egyptian rousette bat has been confirmed as a reservoir of the Marburgvirus genus and does not show signs of disease (Fig. 2a; Tables 2 and 3) (Towner et al., 2009; Amman et al., 2012). Birthing periods are reported to be a driver for MARV infection (Amman et al, 2012) with distinct viral pulses in juvenile bats of approximately six months old, coinciding with biannual bat birthing seasons in Uganda as well as the timing of human infections. It is not clear how the virus first transmits from bats to humans, but outbreaks have been linked to gold mining activities and entering of caves with potential contact with faecal excretions or aerosols.",

The Ebolavirus genus now consists of five species representing Ebolavirus (EBOV) (previously Ebola Zaire), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV) and Reston virus (RESTV) (Kuhn et al., 2019). Three of the ebolavirus species, EBOV, BDBV and SUDV, are highly lethal in people with more than 25 human outbreaks reported since 1976 and case fatality rates of 25\u201090%. Most outbreaks are caused by EBOV (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 2b) with the most significant one during 2013\u20102016 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia with more than 11 000 fatalities (Spengler et al., 2016). Index cases were most often in direct contact with ebolavirus\u2010infected primates or other large vertebrates, either killed or found dead in forested areas. However, these animals also succumb to disease and are therefore not considered the reservoir species. Investigations into possible reservoir hosts for EBOV (including birds and small terrestrial vertebrates) indicated the presence of EBOV RNA only in three fruit bat species: hammer\u2010headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), Franquet's epauletted fruit bat (Epomops franqueti) and the little collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata) in Gabon and DRC (Leroy et al., 2005) (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 2b). Other studies reported circumstantial evidence, for example, the proposed index case in the 2016 Ebolavirus outbreak (a 2\u2010year\u2010old boy from the small village of Meliandou, Guinea) may have been infected while playing in a hollow tree used as a roost by a colony of Angolan free\u2010tailed bats (Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z et al., 2015). However, this was not substantiated by subsequent field and virological investigations. Experimental infection studies of EBOV in plants and animals revealed that three bat species, that is the Angolan free\u2010tail (Tadarida condylura, now M. condylurus), the little free\u2010tail (T. pumila, now C. pumila) and the epauletted fruit bats, support EBOV replication with seroconversion and no disease manifestation (Swanepoel et al., 1996). Numerous other studies have reported on the presence of anti\u2010ebolavirus antibodies in several bat species in Africa as well as other continents, including Asia and Europe (Olival & Hayman, 2014) (Tables 2 and 3). In search of the reservoir species, a recent detection of EBOV RNA in the greater long\u2010fingered bat (Miniopterus cf. inflatus) in Liberia (Epstein personal communication) was reported.",

The taxonomy of this viral family has seen several changes over the past decade (Afonso et al., 2016). More recently, as a result of numerous surveillance studies in a several hosts including bats, the viral family was divided into four subfamilies (Avulavirinae, Rubulavirinae, Orthoparamyxovirinae and Metaparamyxovirinae) now with 14 genera to accommodate the growing diversity (ICTV, 2019).

Two novel henipaviruses, Hendra and Nipah virus (Henipavirus genus, Orthoparamyxovirinae subfamily), emerged from bats in the genus Pteropus, that is flying foxes from Australia and South\u2010East Asia, respectively (Murray et al., 1995; Chua et al., 1999, 2002; Halpin et al., 2000). These viruses were associated with neurological and respiratory disease in their intermediate spillover hosts (horses and pigs, respectively) and subsequently humans. The henipaviruses are of considerable public and veterinary health importance given the associated high morbidity and mortality rates in humans and their animal hosts, as well as the lack of effective post\u2010exposure treatment or availability of a human vaccine as a preventative measure. Nipah virus, in particular, has a case fatality rate ranging from 38% to 100% in particular outbreaks (Ang, Lim & Wang, 2018). In addition, this virus has reportedly been transmitted directly from bats to humans with subsequent human\u2010to\u2010human transmission in near\u2010annual Bangladesh outbreaks (Islam et al., 2016). The geographical distribution of Nipah virus outbreaks has expanded in the last few years with reports from South India where an 88.9% mortality rate was reported for the 2018 outbreak (Sadanadan et al., 2018). These henipaviruses are excreted in bat urine (Smith et al., 2011), which is believed to be the route of transmission to humans and other susceptible animals. Additionally, viral detection and isolation have been reported from excreted uterine fluid during the bat reproductive season (Halpin et al., 2000), as well as from partially eaten fruit dropped to the ground presenting additional routes of potential virus transmission (Chua et al., 2002).",

However, serological surveillance for henipaviruses in the African straw\u2010coloured fruit bat from Ghana (Tables 2 and 3) provided the first evidence of Henipavirus\u2010related viruses on the African continent (Hayman et al., 2010). This was supported by the detection of viral RNA in faecal material from the same species (Drexler et al., 2009). Since these reports, numerous other surveillance studies were conducted on a number of African bat species resulting in the detection of a diversity of paramyxovirus sequences in both insectivorous and frugivorous bats. In addition, potential zoonotic paramyxoviruses closely related to known human pathogens have been reported mainly from frugivorous bat species (Drexler et al., 2009, 2012; Baker et al., 2012; Weiss et al., 2012; Conrardy et al., 2014; Muleya et al., 2014; Mortlock et al., 2015, 2019) including Henipavirus\u2010related viruses (Fig. 3a). Since viruses within the Henipavirus genus are of zoonotic importance, initial surveillance studies were focused on the African straw\u2010coloured fruit bat. Subsequently, other fruit bat species including the Egyptian rousette bat, little collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata), Gambian epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus gambianus) and hammer\u2010headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) also tested positive for henipavirus\u2010related RNA (Tables 2 and 3).",

Viral RNA was subsequently detected in archival samples collected from this species and country as far back as 2009, indicating that the virus had been present in these populations for several years prior to emergence.

Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected saliva on open wounds or mucosal membranes with a bite from an infected animal as the most common introduction (Banyard & Fooks, 2017). Currently, the genus consists of 16 officially recognized viral species: the type species Rabies lyssavirus and the rabies\u2010related lyssaviruses [Aravan lyssavirus, Australian bat lyssavirus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, Duvenhage lyssavirus, European bat 1 lyssavirus, European bat 2 lyssavirus, Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus, Ikoma lyssavirus, Irkut lyssavirus, Khujand lyssavirus, Lagos bat lyssavirus, Lleida bat lyssavirus, Mokola lyssavirus, Shimoni bat lyssavirus and West Caucasian bat lyssavirus with one additional putative virus; Taiwan bat lyssavirus (Hu et al., 2018; Amarasinghe et al., 2019)]. Rabies virus (RABV) occurs worldwide and has the broadest reported host range of all the lyssaviruses infecting multiple mammalian orders including carnivores and bats. Most human rabies deaths, estimated to be ca. 59 000/annum, are due to exposure to rabid dogs and rabies virus infection. The predominant reservoir of all the other lyssaviruses (rabies\u2010related lyssaviruses) is Old World bats with RABV only associated with bats in the New World (Markotter & Coertse, 2018). Six lyssavirus species have been described from Africa: RABV that is only associated with terrestrial mammals, Lagos bat lyssavirus (LBV), Duvenhage lyssavirus (DUVV) and Shimoni bat lyssavirus (SHIBV) that are associated with various bat species (Fig. 4) and Mokola lyssavirus (MOKV) and Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV) with an unknown reservoir host that has only been reported in spillover hosts (Markotter & Coertse, 2018).",

Not only did the outbreak have an economic impact on the countries where the outbreak occurred, but also an estimated global cost of more than US$32 billion. Similarly, a previous global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus in 2002 resulted in over 800 human deaths with an economic impact of US$50 billion.

However, the diversity of the rabies\u2010related lyssaviruses has expanded and it became clear that the current vaccine may not protect against this viral diversity. As more virus families are identified in bats, additional transmission routes including contact with bat body fluids and excreta (faeces and urine) became apparent and no treatment or prophylaxis for these viruses exists. People who are in contact with bats frequently, including fieldworkers, are at a greater risk of being infected than the general public. It is unknown what pathogens will be present in bats and although the probability of being infected is extremely low, all animals and samples must therefore be considered infectious. In addition should we also recognize that humans can transmit diseases to bats and between environments for example white\u2010nose syndrome that emerged in North America and devastated the bat populations. Biosafety must be of utmost importance in all fieldwork investigations (Moratelli & Calisher, 2015) and must include pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis for rabies according to recommendations (Markotter & Coertse, 2018). Fieldworkers must be made aware of the risk involve and a basic medical surveillance programme must be in place, especially to monitor exposures. Bites, scratches and contact with excretions and body fluids must be avoided and are therefore recommended to wear appropriate handling gloves over a double layer of disposable gloves, disposable clothing (surgical gowns, Tyvek coveralls) and rubber boots with shoe coverings. Aerosols are also a potential transmission route, and therefore, a respirator with high\u2010efficiency particulate filters is the only efficient way to protect against infective particles. Mucous membranes including the eyes must also be covered. Fieldworkers must be properly trained in wearing of personal protective equipment including how to disinfect and remove it safely after activities. All reusable equipment and supplies must also be disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant (e.g. 10% chlorine), and biowaste must be sterilized using appropriate methods before disposal.",

            "text": "As discussed in this review, the detection of a virus in bats does not constitute spillover and several ecological and biological factors can play a role in disease emergence. Seasonality has been associated with paramyxoviruses, where virus excretion has been observed in the dry winter months in lower latitudes (McFarlane, Becker & Field, 2011; Field et al., 2015; McMichael et al., 2017; Paez et al., 2017). Bat densities, nutritional stress and events during the reproductive season of bats (waning maternal antibodies, late pregnancy and breeding) have been found to correspond with peaks in virus shedding (Plowright et al., 2008; Amman et al., 2012; Dietrich et al., 2015; Paez et al., 2017; Paweska et al., 2018; Mortlock et al., 2019). The role that meta\u2010population dynamics play in pathogen prevalence and viral sharing is also unknown, with very few studies investigating movement patterns of bats (Amman et al., 2012; Fahr et al., 2015; Abedi\u2010Lartey et al., 2016; Olson et al., 2019). Viral dynamics may additionally vary across host bat species, viral genera or even individual virus species. Environmental and anthropogenic changes act as a major contributor to disease emergence and include activities such as changes in land use, human population growth and increased mobility across landscapes, changes in human socioeconomic behaviour or social structure, trade increase, forest fires, extreme weather events, wars and breakdown in public health infrastructure, to name a few. These activities also result in increased contact with wildlife such as bats, ultimately leading to a higher risk of spillover. Furthermore, correct morphological bat species identification correlated with publically available genetic sequence information that is accurate is becoming essential for species identification. Misinformed host identification may implicate incorrect species but is also important to determine accurate distribution maps and potential geographically risk of pathogens.",

            "text": "Further understanding of the many factors that may play a role in spillover of pathogens from bats to humans will require structured, systematic, longitudinal surveillance of bat populations (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2018) that includes multi\u2010 and transdisciplinary approaches in addition to virological investigations. It is also essential to involve a multidisciplinary team to develop appropriate management plans to minimize risks of human infection without causing significant harm to the bat populations. We also cannot ignore the critical ecological services that bats provide, that is their participation as fruit pollinators and controlling insect pest populations [reviewed in (Kunz et al., 2011; Kasso & Balakrishnan, 2013; L\u00f3pez\u2010Baucells, Rocha & Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Llamazares, 2018)]. As such, removing bats from a specific ecosystem can have devastating consequences (Amman et al., 2014). Finally, can we confidently link bats with emerging viruses? In the majority of cases, the answer is no with essential evidence still missing.",
