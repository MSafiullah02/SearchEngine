Percolation comes in many flavors, and the information we gain depends on which variety we choose. Most frequently, we study bond or site percolation, but researchers have also found that k-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM) provide valuable insights [1\u20136]. These processes are closely related, and indeed similar mathematical approaches have been used to study several of these processes [7,8]. Our main result is that all of these (and some related) processes can be derived as special cases of the WTM, and in fact several of these are completely equivalent to the WTM.",

If we consider systems in which nodes change status in response to the status of their neighbors, and the potential path of statuses they can have is acyclic (that is, they can never return to a previous status), then many variants of percolation can be applied. This is commonly used for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) disease, in which an individual can be infected by an infected neighbor. However, much recent work has focused on the spread of \u201csocial contagion\u201d or \u201ccomplex contagions\u201d [9,10] in which multiple transmissions may be required in order to cause \u201cinfection.\u201d Sometimes this is presented as assigning each node a threshold ru such that u becomes infected once ru neighbors are \u201cinfected.\u201d Other times this is presented as a reduction (or increase) in the probability that a neighbor will transmit as an individual encounters more infected individuals. This models the idea that after hearing seemingly independent \u201cconfirmation\u201d of a rumor, people may be more likely to believe and spread it, or after seeing multiple people engaging in buying a product, someone is more likely to perceive a consensus and buy the product as well. Some experimental evidence of this has been found [11,12].",

It is seen to have hybrid phase transitions, with a square-root-type scaling on one side of a transition followed by a discontinuous jump [4,25]. In a variant, \u201cheterogeneous k-core\u201d percolation [26], each node is assigned its own threshold value and deleted if its degree goes below the threshold. We note that many authors have used the term \u201cbootstrap percolation\u201d to denote k-core percolation, and indeed this appears to be the original term [1,3,4], but we reserve \u201cbootstrap percolation\u201d for a closely related dual process.

It has received considerable study on lattices [31,32], and its behavior in large random networks has been the subject of some more recent analysis [33].

This repeats and the probability of successful transmission on the mth neighbor's infection is pm. If pm=p for all m, then this is the network version of the classical Reed-Frost model [35] for a susceptible-infected-recovered disease [36]. If pm decreases as m increases, this could model decreasing susceptibility due to an improved immune response as exposures accumulate, or it could simply represent preexisting heterogeneities in susceptibility that are revealed as the number of exposures increases. An increasing pm would model some synergistic or cumulative effect of exposures as seen in \u201ccomplex contagions\u201d [9].

The probability that node u has a given r is given by P(ru=r|du)=q(r|du). A node begins as either active or inactive. If an inactive node u has at least ru active neighbors, then it becomes active. We assume that the initially active nodes may be chosen independently at random [which can be modeled by having q(r|d)>0 for some r\u22640], or they may be chosen by some other rule, in which case we treat the set of initially active nodes as an input to the algorithm. Often a common threshold r* is chosen so P(ru=r*)=1 or a common fraction \u03c1* is chosen so P(ru=\u2308\u03c1*du\u2309|du)=1. As described above, this is frequently used to model social contagions. In [6] it was conjectured that for a global cascade to occur from an infinitesimally small initial proportion active, a giant component of nodes with r=1 would need to exist. This is true in random configuration model networks, but false in random clustered networks [8]. As with bootstrap and k-core percolation, this is known to exhibit hybrid bifurcations [8].",

We then select a node and successively add nodes to its component once their threshold number of neighbors have been visited. This process is likely to terminate without exploring all nodes. If this happens, we iteratively select a new node and add nodes to its component whenever their threshold number nodes have been visited (either in this stage or while building a previous component). The resulting components match the components observed in bond percolation. Nodes are activated exactly when they are added to a component in the bond percolation, and identifying in which iteration they are activated tells us which component they are part of. We show two different implementations based on a depth-first and breadth-first search beginning with the same thresholds and initial node in Fig. 5. The component reached in the first pass is the same for both approaches as long as the initial nodes of the passes are chosen in the same order.
