Therefore, donor criteria for islet transplantation were based on the guideline issued by Japanese Society of Tissue Transplantation (JSTT) [ 11 ] , which is shown in Table 21 .1 . According to the guideline, when a specifi c disease or state is observed in a donor, retrieval or transplant of tissue from the donor must not be permitted. It is necessary to conduct inspection and palpation of the donor, as detailed as possible. Interview of the donor's next of kin and studying the donor's medical records are also required. The results of a pathological autopsy, if performed, must be reviewed. For all tests performed, conduct the most current methodology. Criteria and methods of tests or examinations must be always updated at a tissue bank (Islet isolation center), in accordance with technical and scientifi c advancements and new fi ndings in infectious diseases. (It is desirable to involve experts from related Table 21 .1 Exclusion criteria of tissue donors in general (Guideline on the safety, storage, and application of human tissue in medical practice. IV.

The withdrawal of a respirator is rarely performed even though the donor is diagnosed to be brain dead (Maastricht category 4 [ 12 ] ). Moreover, the donors usually are not examined to diagnose brain death, and thus, a cannulation into an abdominal aorta with a double-balloon catheter via a femoral artery and a systemic heparinization are not permitted before a cardiac arrest (modifi ed Maastricht category 5 [ 13 ] ). To shorten warm ischemic time and maintain a viability of the pancreas for islet isolation, we use in situ machine washout (ISMW) technique [ 14 , 15 ] , which was originally developed for the procurement of the kidneys from DCD donors. The effi cacy of ISMW on clinical kidney transplantation from DCD donors is described in detail in another chapter. For the procurement of the pancreas from DCD donors, a double-balloon catheter position needs to be changed to perfuse celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery as well as bilateral renal arteries. We usually place the distal balloon in the aorta which is located above the celiac axis and only distal balloon is infl ated. X-ray and ultrasound sonography are used for the confi rmation of the collect location of the balloon. The University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is most frequently used as the perfusate of ISMW for the procurement of pancreas.",

            "text": "Sixty-fi ve islet isolations were performed at fi ve authorized centers of islet isolation and transplantation from December 2003 to March 2007. Only one isolation (the fi rst isolation in Japan) was performed using the pancreas from DBD donor and the other 64 isolations were performed using DCD donors. Thirty-four successful isolations (53.1 % of 64 isolations from DCD donors) fulfi lled the fresh islet transplantation criteria and were transplanted to the 18 patients. The analysis of the factors infl uencing the results of the islet isolation demonstrated that the donor age and a warm ischemic time did not affect the results. In contrast, duration of low blood pressure of the donor, cold ischemic time, and usage of Kyoto solution for preservation was signifi cantly infl uenced factors [ 40 ] . Multivariate analysis selected usage of Kyoto solution as most important. All 18 recipients were type 1 diabetic patients with the history of diabetes from 6 to 37 years. The age of the recipients ranged from 16 to 61 years (36.2 \u00b1 10.9 years) and the gender was 5 males/13 females. Four patients underwent two sequential islet transplantations and six patients underwent three sequential islet transplantations. Out of four patients who underwent two islet transplantations, one patient showed insulin independency, and two out of six patients who underwent three islet transplantations achieved insulin independency. However, all of these patients returned to insulin dependency from 2 weeks to 6 months after achieving insulin independency. The islet transplantation technique was performed according to the Edmonton Protocol. The isolated islets were transplanted into the portal vein using an angiocatheter via an ultrasonography-guided puncture. A steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen was used with sirolimus, tacrolimus, and anti-CD25 antibody according to the Edmonton Protocol5. As is shown in Fig. 21.1 , the serum C-peptide levels were 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 ng/mL after the fi rst, 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 ng/mL after the second, and 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 ng/mL after the third islet transplantation. The positive insulin secretion from the islets, as indicated by the serum C-peptide levels, resulted in the decreased insulin requirement: 39.7 \u00b1 18.0 U/day before, 24.2 \u00b1 110 U/day after the fi rst, 21.4 \u00b1 11.5 U/day after the second, and 21.0 \u00b1 7.7 U/day after the third islet transplantation. In addition, the hemoglobin A1C levels (JDS) decreased from 8.8 \u00b1 1.8 % before transplantation to 7.5 \u00b1 1.4 % after the fi rst, 6.5 \u00b1 1.4 % after the second, and The outcome of clinical islet transplantation in Japan: insulin requirement ( a ) decreased after the fi rst (1st), the second (2nd), and the third (3rd) islet transplantation. Serum C-peptide levels ( b ) became positive after islet transplantation. Especially after the third islet transplantation, serum CPR showed 0.8 + 0.4 ng/mL. Hemoglobin A1C ( c ) decreased after islet transplantation due to the stabilization of blood glucose levels 6.2 \u00b1 1.2 % after the third islet transplantation. All patients obtained stabilized blood glucose levels which resulted in the disappearance of hypoglycemic unawareness19.",

The causes of death were cerebrovascular disorder (ten cases), hypoxic encephalopathy (seven cases), trauma (fi ve cases), and one brain tumor. After cardiac arrest, the pancreas were procured using our ISMW technique. In 9 of the 23 donors, permission was not given to insert a catheter into the aorta for systemic heparinization before a cardiac arrest, which resulted in a prolonged warm ischemic period. The pancreas were preserved using a TLM or a simple cold storage in UW solution and were transported to our CPC. The islet isolation was performed according to the Edmonton Protocol with some modifi cations [ 41 -48 ] . Briefl y, the pancreas was distended with a cold Liberase solution (Liberase HI, Roche Diagnostics\u2122, IN) by a ductal injection. Thereafter, the distended pancreas were cut into several pieces and put into a Ricordi chamber and digested using a closed automated system at 37 \u00b0C. The shaking of the Ricordi chamber was performed either by hand or by a shaking apparatus. The pancreatic digests were collected in a fl ask on ice and were purifi ed on a Euro-Ficoll discontinuous solution using a COBE 2991 cell processor. When the results of the isolation fulfi lled the criteria for fresh islet transplantation in Japan, the islets were immediately transplanted to the recipient.",

Thus, DCD can be an important resource for islet transplantation if used under strict releasing criteria and in multiple transplantations, particularly in countries where heart-beating donors are not readily available. However, the outcome of clinical islet transplantation using Edmonton protocol is not satisfactory results. In particular, long-term islet survival has not been achieved, resulting in poor achievement of insulin independency. Based on these results, the Japanese Islet Transplant Registry currently introduced a newly designed clinical islet transplantation protocol including an immunosuppressive protocol using anti-thymus globulin and anti TNF \u03b1, and the use of DBD donors. Changes in blood glucose levels after islet transplantation in the patient #1: control of blood glucose levels became poor 12 months after transplantation. However, blood glucose levels were again stabilized by second islet transplantation",
