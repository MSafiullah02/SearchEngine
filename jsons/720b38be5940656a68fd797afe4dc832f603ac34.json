For example, federal 64 hours-of-service (HOS) laws create a regulatory environment where drivers are subject to the 65 intense competitive pressures in the current trucking industry and yet are liable for HOS 66 violations as they try to meet these demands. 7 67 These macro-level forces have shaped downstream trucking company policies and 68 practices, resulting in numerous stressogenic work organization characteristics and workplace 69 experiences for LHTD.

However, 100 emerging anecdotal evidence affords us clues into key COVID-19 stressors and their plausible 101 consequences. These stressors can be broadly categorized as either exacerbatory or novel. 102 6 Several aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate endemic chronic stressors. 103 Drivers are under immense pressure from to maintain critical supply chains and accommodate 104 demand surges for consumer and healthcare goods, 6 and these pressures have been exacerbated 105 by concerns about travel restrictions 26,27 and enabled by the relaxation of HOS rules for the 106 transportation of essential goods. 28 However, these pressures are now combined with freight 107 volatility, as overall trucking volumes are expected to slow down and demands for other goods, 108 such as those related to manufacturing, have already declined. 26,29 Impending declines in freight 109 volumes are expected to threaten drivers' wages and potentially their livelihoods. 26 Further, as 110 the result of physical distancing mandates, worksite amenities have become even more sparse; as 111 a result, many drivers have struggled with finding meals, safe parking, restrooms, and 112 showers. 30,31 113 The COVID-19 pandemic also presents an array of novel stressors for LHTD. One new 114 source of stress is worrying about getting sick from COVID-19, which is compounded due to the 115 fact that they may fall ill thousands of miles from home and without any practical means for 116 testing, treatment, or quarantine. 6,31,32 Drivers expose themselves to infection as they move in 117 and out of areas with outbreaks, 32 and as they interact with various social contacts they pose 118 acquisition and transmission risks to themselves and others. 6,33 These worries are made worse by 119 the absence of personal protective equipment available to them, 32,34 as well as a lack of corporate 120 policies to protect them from infection, such as workplace physical distancing protocols and 121 open and prompt communication about possible workplace infection cases. 34 122 The potential consequences that these COVID-19 stressors pose to LHTD health and 123 safety are numerous. One consequence may be strains on supply chains due to labor 124 fluctuations. The trucking industry was experiencing a labor shortage before the onset of the 125 7 COVID-19 pandemic, 35 and the lack of PPE or other policies to prevent LHTD infection may 126 result in walk-outs, absenteeism, and leave. 34 Drivers may leave the profession altogether due to 127 increased levels of burnout or alienation as the result of these stressors. 11,36 Supply chain strains 128 may create greater pressures on the remaining labor pool to fulfill demand surges, resulting in a 129 vicious cycle of even greater LHTD chronic stress. Increases in chronic stressors may perpetuate 130 another vicious cycle related LHTD health: Due to corresponding increases in AL accumulation, 131immune suppression may render them more likely to get sick if they are exposed to the virus, and 132 cardiometabolic dysfunction may make them more likely to experience COVID-19 133 morbidity/mortality; 37-41 further, COVID-19 morbidity and sequelae may perpetuate existing 134 health disparities; for example, by exacerbating cardiovascular dysfunction due to damage to the 135 heart 38 and/or worsening metabolic dysfunction through pancreatic injury or acute kidney 136 injury. 42-44 Because cardiometabolic dysfunction is associated with increased likelihood of sleep 137 disorders, fatigue, and roadway crashes, 45,46 the impacts of COVID-19 stressors may manifest as",

Further, these frameworks tend to overlook both the macro-level 149 forces that lead to the clustering of adverse outcomes in populations and the interrelated and150 potentially reinforcing nature of these outcomes. 49 This means that the consequences of the 151 COVID-19 pandemic for LHTD cannot be adequately understood -or acted upon -in isolation 152 from the inherently stressogenic context of the profession, the historical and ongoing forces that 153 have induced the chronic stressors and health and safety disparities endemic to the profession, 154 and the potentially reinforcing nature of these afflictions. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 155 research and prevention needs theoretical frameworks that contextualize COVID-19 stressors 156 holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and 157 safety outcomes. 158 In our view, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide 159 commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention. The term 'syndemic' is defined as the 160 clustering, due to sociostructural forces, of two or more interacting and exacerbatory afflictions 161 within a population. 49 The dual emphasis of syndemic frameworks on the clustering of health 162 and safety within populations due to macro-level forces and on the reinforcing nature of these 163 afflictions can provide the grounding to allow foregoing COVID-19 commercial driver research 164 to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks. 49,50 This understanding can then 165 embody the emergence of interrelated health and safety afflictions due to the endemic 166 stressogenic nature of long-haul trucking, how they are continually shaped by the dynamic 167 macro-level policies and forces that have unfolded over time, and how these afflictions may 168 perpetuate extant disparities and shape morbidity/mortality vulnerabilities. 49 In the case of 169 COVID-19, those macro-level policies and forces that perpetuate disparities can be expected to 170 similarly induce detrimental outcomes to novel pandemic stressors, along with a worsening of 9 related endemic stressors and corresponding stress responses. The consequences can be 172 expected to synergistically interact with existing disparities and unfold across heterogeneous 173 timeframes -for example, short timeframes for consequences associated with acute COVID-19 174infection and full recovery (e.g., temporary loss of labor supply), and longer timeframes for 175 consequences associated with inadequate trucking company policies to protect workers from 176 COVID-19 infection (e.g., workforce burnout and alienation).",

In contrast to the limitations of individual-focused, single-component or multi-182 component interventions 49,51 that are most commonplace and most likely to be characteristic of 183 foregoing COVID-19 programming, syndemic frameworks inherently inform large-scale public 184 policy interventions that target macro-level drivers of disparities within populations, while also 185 incorporating the presence of interrelated afflictions and vulnerabilities. 49 As a result, these 186 prevention efforts would constitute holistic multi-level interventions that both modify the macro-187 level forces that have led to the clustering of disparities and also address and treat health and 188 safety vulnerabilities and outcomes at the driver-level. changes have fundamentally altered the structure and organization of the 192 work and workplaces of U.S. commercial drivers.
