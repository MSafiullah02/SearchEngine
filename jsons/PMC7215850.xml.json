Although influenza is a common respiratory disease, several serious complications, such as pneumonia, could develop if the disease is not controlled rapidly and effectively [2]. It has been estimated that seasonal influenza may cause 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness, and lead to almost 500,000 deaths annually because of the increasing susceptibility in populations [3]. In fact, the four main influenza pandemics over the last hundred years, which occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 respectively, caused millions of deaths across the world [4,5,6].",

Initial outbreaks were first recorded in Wuhan, a major city in mainland China, in December 2019, and now the disease has spread rapidly all over the world. According to the official website of National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the coronavirus pneumonia had killed 3318 and infected 81,589 people in China by 24:00, 1 April 2020 (Local time). In addition, there were 20,072 people under risk of infection because of close contact with infected individuals [8]. At the same time, 823,626 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection had been detected and confirmed in more than 100 countries based on the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report (10:00 CET 1 April 2020) [9]. Concerns about COVID-19 have not reduced, and the United States is fighting with a recent wave of winter influenza. According to the latest data from the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 32 million people in the United States have been infected with the flu virus since the 2019\u20132020 winter flu season, and influenza-related deaths could reach to 18,000, and is arguably one of the deadliest flu outbreaks in the past 40 years [10]. Therefore, increasing vaccine research and exploring other methodologies that may provide beneficial effects to improve protection from the disease is of great clinical importance globally.",

For example, Kohut et al. [2] evaluated the effects of moderate exercise on antibody responses to influenza vaccination in older adults, and they found that an exercise group presented a significantly greater increase in antibody titer. Moreover, an animal study conducted by Lowder et al. [11] investigated the effects of different doses of exercise on immune responses, morbidity, and mortality after mice has been infected by influenza virus. The results showed that moderate intensity exercise can significantly reduce the mortality of infected mice. However, contrary findings to this also exist. Ranadive et al. [14] studied the effects of acute moderate exercise on influenza vaccine effectiveness, suggesting that acute moderate exercise does not enhance the vaccine efficacy in older men. Similarly, Long et al. [15] also reported that moderate intensity brisk walking has no effect on antibody responses to both influenza and pneumonia immunization. The literature suggests that physical exercise may exert some benefits on the prevention and treatment of influenza-related diseases, an extensive review, however, is required for further verification.",

By 2050, 21.1% of the world population will be 60 years or older, which is unprecedented in human history [16,17]. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in aged populations poses a great threat to the healthcare system [3]. Aging is inevitably associated with declining organic and physiological function, such as immunosenescence, which refers to the age-related decline in immune capacity [18,19]. There is sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate that older adults are more vulnerable to infectious diseases (especially influenza, pneumonia) and also have lower immune responses to vaccines in relation to younger or middle-aged counterparts [15,20,21,22,23]. For example, Long et al. [15] reported that older individuals had greater lower antibody responses to some of the influenza and pneumonia vaccination strains when compared to younger individuals. Hence, considering the potential benefits of exercise, there is an urgent need to explore effective exercise strategies to facilitate healthy aging.",

Therefore, they hypothesized that the exercise-induced benefits may be associated with innate immune processes, or have not been detected because of limited parameters being assessed. Two additional studies used a similar single bout of moderate aerobic exercise intervention. Long et al. [15] examined whether acute moderate exercise can improve immune responses to pneumonia and half dose influenza immunization and found no enhanced responses to either of the vaccines. Ranadive et al. [14] also reported no difference in antibody responses in older men. However, results were not uniform in men and women. They found that acute moderate aerobic exercise can significantly enhance the immune responses to full dose influenza vaccination in older women.

In addition, two recent studies developed a similar home-based exercise for aspiration pneumonia prevention and falls [29,30].

However, a female population study by Ranadive et al. [14] recorded an enhanced response after exercise. Further studies should consider the potential effects of sex differences. However, a review by Psdcoe et al. [41] aimed to examine the effects of both acute and chronic exercise on the immune responses to vaccination and demonstrated that acute moderate-intensity exercise (one bout employed at the time of vaccination) may also contribute positively to the antibody responses. Explanation for the lack of consistency for this study could be the age difference. Most studies that reported similar findings focused on the effects of exercise on immunocompetence in young subjects [42,43,44,45]. However, although all the X-sec studies demonstrated positive associations between exercise and influenza-related mortality or immunocompetence, there seems to be no consistent intensity of exercise reported as both moderate and vigorous exercise may boost the antibody responses [33,35].

It is worth noting that one study in this review found that Taiji practice can enhance the immune responses to influenza immunization [32]. More studies are needed to further ensure its effectiveness and potential mechanisms. The special home-based exercise program also exhibited preventive effects to aspiration pneumonia [29,30]. However, this kind of exercise form may relate to disease types and thus a lack of generalization is probable. Physical frailty, a concept that can be applied to evaluate physical fitness, is marked by diminished endurance, strength, and decreased physical function [36,46]. Two studies that examined the effects of physical frailty on immunocompetence were included in this review as this may also reflect the role of exercise (physical condition) [36,39]. However, the results appeared to be conflicting. One study by Yao et al. [39] reported that physical frailty may impair the immune responses and increase the rate of influenza-like illness while Moehling et al. [36] found that subjects aged 50\u201365 with physical frailty exhibited significantly greater immune responses, which is completely opposite to the results of all the other observational and X-sec studies. However, the underlying cause was not further investigated in their studies.",

Prolonged moderate aerobic exercise has been previously proven and further confirmed in this review that it contributes some positive benefits on influenza (or pneumonia) immunization. The role of endogenous opioids, inflammatory biomarkers, or memory to naive T lymphocyte ratio have received some support, suggesting they may be associated with the subsequent exercise-induced benefits. Interestingly, Kohut et al. [12] demonstrated that the mechanisms of exercise-induced enhancement in immune responses may also involve psychological factors (e.g., depression, stress). Indeed, there are some studies that have concentrated on the effects of psychology on immunocompetence and an additional review could help to elucidate these outcomes.",

A review conducted by Psdcoe et al. [41] also supported the above hypothesis. In addition, the mechanisms by which exercise improves immune response may vary with exercise forms. Bohn-Goldbaum et al. [25] demonstrated that the lymph flow rate, rather than interleukin-6 circulating levels, could be one of the biomarkers for the enhancement stimulated by acute resistance exercises. Yang et al. [32] inferred that the changes of autonomic balance induced by Taiji and Qigong practice may be the potential mechanism for the enhanced responses although it has not been tested. In summary, while the internal mechanisms remain inconclusive, it is well-established that there are several links between neuroendocrine factors and exercise that could impact positively on the cells of the immune system [47,48,49,50,51,52,53]. More physiological studies are much warranted to further reveal the associated mechanistic biochemistry.",
