Membrane-form TNF-alpha is released from the cell surface as a 17-kDa non-glycosylated protein (soluble-form TNF-alpha) through the action of the metalloproteinase, TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), and enters the circulation as a 55-kDa homotrimer (Moss et al., 1997, Smith and Baglioni, 1987). Homotrimer TNF-alpha binds to cell surface TNF receptors (TNFR) and induces various physiological activities (Vandenabeele et al., 1995, Reinhard et al., 1997). For example, when it binds to cell surface TNFR-1, caspase is activated and induces apoptosis, and when it binds to cell surface TNFR-2, transcription factors, such as NF-kB and c-Jun, are activated that promote cell proliferation and induce the expression of cytokines involved in immunity and inflammation.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cats. Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation (Pedersen, 2009). Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid was shown to accumulate in some FIP cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV (Dewerchin et al., 2005, Stoddart and Scott, 1989). We previously showed that virus replication in macrophages induced TNF-alpha production. TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected macrophages was involved in lymphopenia and an increase in the level of the cellular receptor of type II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) (Takano et al., 2007a, Takano et al., 2007b). Moreover, it was reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP was inhibited by TNF-alpha. This finding suggests that neutrophilia in cats with FIP due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival (Takano et al., 2009).",

We investigated whether MAb 2\u20134 inhibited recombinant TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes using the feline T-lymphocyte cell line, Fet-J cells. A histogram of the fluorescence intensity of Fet-J cells measured using flow cytometry is shown in Fig. 6\nA. A bimodal peak was noted in the histogram of Fet-J cells reacted with recombinant TNF-alpha, which indicated that apoptosis was induced. The positive rate of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the presence of recombinant TNF-alpha than in that of the medium alone. On the other hand, the positive rate of apoptotic cells was significantly lower in the presence of recombinant TNF-alpha and MAb 2\u20134 than in that of recombinant TNF-alpha alone (Fig. 6B).",

            "text": "No feline TNF-alpha-neutralizing MAb has previously been prepared. We have prepared nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize feline TNF-alpha by immunizing mice with recombinant feline TNF-alpha. All of MAbs produced exhibited different reactivities between the recombinant and natural feline TNF-alpha contained in FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatants using Western blotting. On Western blotting, TNF-alpha was degenerated by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, for which MAb 1\u20132 and 2\u20132 did not react with either recombinant or natural TNF-alpha. This result suggests that these MAbs recognized conformation epitope of TNF-alpha. In contrast, MAb 2\u20131 and 3 react with natural TNF-alpha only; however, the details of their antigen-recognizing properties could not be clarified. Recombinant TNF-alpha forms a monomer (17-kDa), whereas natural TNF-alpha forms a homotrimer (55-kDa), which suggests that recombinant TNF-alpha is monomeric form while natural TNF-alpha is trimetric form (R&B Systems Product data sheet). Therefore, MAb 2\u20131 and 3 may recognize only trimetric TNF-alpha. Saijo et al. described the preparation of the trimeric human TNF-alpha-recognizing MAb 3F2 (Saijo et al., 1995). They showed that the weak reactivity of MAb 3F2 was observed with monomeric TNF-alpha dissociated from trimeric TNF-alpha by detergent. MAb 2\u20131 and 3 reacted with immobilized monomeric TNF-alpha on ELISA. Smith and Baglioni. showed that monomeric TNF-alpha bound to one another to form trimeric TNF-alpha in a solution that did not contain a degenerating agent, which indicated that recombinant TNF-alpha also formed trimers in a solution containing no detergent and reacted in ELISA (Smith and Baglioni, 1987). Therefore, these findings suggest that MAb 2\u20131 and 3 possess similar properties to those of MAb 3F2.",

(Takano et al., 2007a, Takano et al., 2007b, Takano et al., 2009) We investigated the effect of MAb 2\u20134 on this pathology of FIP in vitro, and confirmed that the neutralization of feline TNF-alpha activity with MAb 2\u20134 inhibited: (i) an increase in the survival rate of neutrophils in cats with FIP, (ii) APN mRNA expression in macrophages, and (iii) apoptosis of the feline T-lymphocyte cell line. Several drugs to treat FIP have been reported, but these mostly aim at an antiviral action (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008, Balzarini et al., 2006, Barlough and Shacklett, 1994, Hsieh et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2013). However, FIP is a viral infection that causes an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. The combination of MAb 2\u20134 that we prepared using already reported anti-FIPV agent(s) may eliminate the virus while inhibiting inflammatory reactions. Currently, steroids are mainly used to inhibit inflammatory reactions in FIP; however, steroids also inhibit the immune system useful for the elimination of FIPV. Since MAb 2\u20134 specifically inhibits TNF-alpha, a factor aggravating the pathology of FIP, it may be more appropriate than steroids.",
