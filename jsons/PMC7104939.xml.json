            "text": "Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule that is mainly expressed on cell membrane surfaces of monocyte/macrophage lineage [8], [9], and acts as a pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity for detection of variety of ligands such as bacterial products, microbial cell wall components and even whole bacteria. Particularly, CD14 is the specific receptor for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria [10], [11]. LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is called \u2018bacterial endotoxin\u2019 [12]. LPS is the main virulence factor of Brucella and has a role in cell entry and immune evasion of the infected cell [6]. LPS also has an ability to induce the production of interleukin (IL)-12 resulting in promotion of T helper (Th) 1 responses and inhibition of Th-2 responses in the host [13]. CD14 as a co-receptor for the toll-like receptor (TLR) and together with TLR4 forms a complex that activates the innate immune system and starts a variety of effector functions including secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, nitric oxide, oxygen radicals and complement components as well as cell proliferation, subsequent binding to LPS [8], [13], [14], [15]. Nevertheless, high production of these molecules may cause intense harmful consequences including severe inflammatory responses, septic shock and death [15]. Moreover, a soluble type of CD14 (sCD14) is produced by monocytes, hepatocytes and endothelial cells and is present in the circulation and other body fluids. sCD14 is derived both from secretion of CD14 and from enzymatically cleaved glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane type of CD14 [10], [16]. Since sCD14 plasma levels increases during inflammation and infection, it is believed that sCD14 is an acute-phase protein, which is increased in several inflammatory processes [8], [15], [17].",

Blood sample from each participant was collected in EDTA-containing tubes for DNA isolation after taking an informed consent from all patients and healthy individuals. All patients were either milk farmers (including diagnosed infected animals) or had a history of consuming raw milk and unpasteurized dairy products. Demographic characteristics of patients and their clinical complications are shown in Table 1\n. Brucellosis was diagnosed according to the clinical manifestations (including fever, night sweating, weakness, malaise, weight loss, splenomegaly, lymphadenophathy, myalgia and arthralgia) and positive blood cultures as described previously [29], [30], [31], [32]. The control group included healthy blood donors with no evidence of brucellosis and genetic disorders and matched for age, sex, and geographic area. The control subjects had the same background as patients and were at the same risk of exposure for brucellosis.",

An additional mismatch was inserted at the penultimate 3\u2032 nucleotide (underlined) of the allele-specific primers to increase the specificity of the PCR reaction.

Haidari et al\n[22], in their study on brucellosis in a Western Iranian population have shown that the frequency of the TT genotype was higher in the patients than in controls (34.5% vs. 15.5%). They suggested that the homozygousity for T allele of promoter of CD14 gene may confer an increased risk of brucellosis, which supports our findings.

            "text": "Most Brucella species are highly virulent causing an acute infection in their hosts. The LPS of this bacterium is one of the essential components for the first steps in the establishment of an intracellular replication niche, in which Brucella survives and multiplies [7]. LPS is a potent stimulator of monocytes and macrophages [25]. Activation of macrophages is one of the early events in the innate immunity to intracellular pathogens. CD14 is a high-affinity receptor for bacterial LPS and is expressed mainly by cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. The binding of LPS to CD14 results in cellular activation and initiates a range of effector functions including cytokine secretion and cell proliferation [8], [19]. CD14 as a co-receptor for the TLR is transferring LPS to the TLR4/MD-2 signaling complex. Engagement of this complex results in the activation of innate immunity mechanisms such as the release of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequently severe inflammatory responses as well as in worse circumstances of septic shock and death [15], [19]. Some studies have been performed to explain the impact of the CD14-159C/T SNP on CD14 protein expression [8], [38]. The CD14-159C/T polymorphism is located at a GC box close to the transcription start site, which serves as a binding site for Sp1-Sp2/Sp3 transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of CD14 gene transcription [15]. The T variant of this SNP is associated with high expression of CD14 on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, which further increases the inflammatory response [39], [40]. Thus, this SNP could be a genetic factor for inter-individual differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases like brucellosis. Our results highlight the role of CD14 in the inflammatory response and the effect of its promoter polymorphism on the host immune defense.",
