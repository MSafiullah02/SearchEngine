Moreover, though it may seem all encouraging to see the effectiveness of authoritarian states in battling the crisis, we, the authors of this paper, would like to raise the community's awareness towards developing more effective means in battling the crisis without the need to limit fundamental human rights.

Arendt considers the privacy concept as a distinction between things that should be shown and things that should be hidden [12] . And that, private spaces exist in opposition to public spaces. Meaning, while the public square is dedicated to appearances, the private space is devoted to the opposite, namely hiding and privacy. She associated privacy with the home. Due to the fact that we have become used to a \"digital private space\", such as our own email inbox or personal data on the phone, people are concerned and offended when the private, hidden space is violated. However, in times of crisis the term hidden or privacy becomes a new meaning.",

According to her framework, privacy is defined as adhering to the norms of information flow [13] . These norms are highly contextual: for example, it is appropriate for doctors to have access to the medical data of their patients, but in most cases it is inappropriate for employers to have access to medical data of their workers. Nissenbaum distinguishes between the following five principles of information flow [14] : the sender, the subject, the receiver, the information type and the transmission principle (e.g. whether confidentiality has to be preserved, whether the data exchange is reciprocal or whether consent is necessary and/or sufficient for the appropriateness of the data exchange). The norms governing these parameters are furthermore evaluated against a specific context, including whether the information flow is necessary for achieving the purpose of the context.",

One of them is persecution by the government -this might not be a big concern in democratic societies, but democratic societies can move into more authoritarian governance styles, especially is crisis situations. Even if this does not happen, there are other harms, e.g. a so called \"chilling effect\", where people are afraid to speak up against the accepted norms when they feel that they are being watched. Furthermore, harms can result from data leaks, like unintentional errors or cyberattacks. In these cases, information about individuals may become known to unintended targets. This can result in physical harm, stalking and damage of the data subject's personal relationships. Knowledge about one's medical data can lead to job discrimination. Leaked details about one's lifestyle can lead to raised insurance rates. Leakage of location data, in particular, can reveal a lot of sensitive information about an individual, such as the places they visit, which might in turn result in dramatic effects when revealed. Just think of closeted homosexuals visiting a gay clubs or marginalized religious minorities visiting their place of worship. Even beyond these concerns, access to large amounts of personal data can be used for more effective opinion and behavior manipulation, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica scandal [15] .",

Furthermore, aside from the danger of collecting data by the government, the crisis situation leads to increase of data collection by private companies, as people all over the world switch to remote communication and remote collaboration tools from faceto-face communications. The data collection and processing practices of these tools, however, are often obscure from their users: as known from research in related fields, privacy policies are often too long, obscure, and complicated to figure out, and shorter notices such as cookie disclaimers tend to be perceived as too vague and not providing useful information [17] , [18] . This leads to users often ignoring the privacy policies and disclaimers, hence, being unaware of important information about their data sharing. Moreover, even among the privacyconcerned users, the adoption of more privacy-friendly tools can be hindered by social pressure and network effects, if everyone else prefers to use more popular tools that are less inclined to protect the privacy of their users (as seen in studies on security and privacy adoption in other domains, see e.g. [19] , [20] ). This data collection even furthers the effects of the so-called surveillance capitalism [21] , which leads to corporations having even more power over people than before the crisis. This access to personal data by corporations is furthermore aggravated by an increased usage of social media platforms, increases in users sharing their location data and giving applications increased access to their phone's operating system. Lowered barriers and increased online activity that can be directly linked to an individual or an email address is a treasure trove for for-profit corporations that monetize consumer data.

As such, data sharing habits in general have been the topic of research, leading to discussions on so-called privacy paradox: people claiming that privacy is important to them, yet not behaving in a privacypreserving way. The privacy paradox can be explained by different factors [22] . One of them is the lack of awareness about the extent of data collection as well as about the possible harms that can result from unrestricted data sharing. A further factor stems from decision biases, such as people's tendency to underestimate the risks that may happen in the future compared against immediate benefit. Another noteworthy factor are the manipulations by service providers (so-called dark patterns) nudging users into sharing more of their data contrary to their actual preferences. But rational decisions in times of crisis are even more difficult. Given the state of stress and anxiety many are in, people might be more likely to accept privacy-problematic practices if they are told that these practices are absolutely necessary for managing the crisiseven if this is not actually the case.",

Research has shown that the person is now more likely to accept the other smaller favor [23] . In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governments first asked their citizens to self-isolate ( limiting significant fundamental freedom) before following up with the smaller favor of handing over some private data to fight the outbreak.

An example of addressing the issues of data protection during the crisis can also be seen within the Austrian project VKT-GOEPL [35] . It was the project's goal to generate a dynamic situational map for ministries overseeing the crisis. Events, such as terrorist attacks, flooding, fire, and pandemic scenarios, were selected. Already ten years ago, the need for geographical movement data provided by telecommunication providers was treated as a use-case. Furthermore, the project initiators prohibited the linking of personal data from different databases in cases where this data was not anonymized. They recommended that ministries are transparently informing all individuals about the policies which apply to the processing of their data.",

Patient data -including personal information such as contact data, sexual preferences or religion amongst others -should not be revealed.
