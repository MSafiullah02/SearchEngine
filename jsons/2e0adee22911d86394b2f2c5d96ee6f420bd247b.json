Method This was an observational qualitative study. Parents of in-curable paediatric malignancy patients who died during the years 2016-2018 were interviewed using a pre-formed open-ended questionnaire. Fears during the last phase of child's life, most disturbing symptoms, choice of end of life care plan, regret of care givers and reasons for such choices were noted and analysed.",

During terminal months, pain (84.62%) was described as the most bothersome symptom followed by respiratory distress (73.08%). Eighteen families (69%) opted for home-based terminal care, 8 (31%) for hospital-based terminal care. Regret of choice was noted in 62.5% families of the hospital-based care group (separation from home environment being the main reason) and 38.89% of the home-based care group (lack of access to health care personnel and pain medication being the main reasons). Conclusion Home-based care is the preferred option for end of life care by the care givers. Lack of community-based terminal care support system and availability of analgesics are the main areas to work on in India.",

Decisions regarding the expected death of a child, like end of life care plan, hospital-or home-based care, are often taken into isolation by care givers and are seldom discussed with the child [1] . Pattern of end of life palliation opted by family has a variable spectrum. A study from Germany noted that 40% of advanced cancer cases opted for chemotherapy-based palliation, but majority regretted it in hindsight. While 80% of families, who opted for home-based terminal care, were satisfied with their decision retrospectively, as many as one-third of the families are not open to discussing the end of life care (EOLC) plan in detail with the treating team [2] . Even when explained about in-curability, parental perception and hope are often unrealistic [3] . Study from India noted that parents welcomed detailed information regarding EOLC care plan and support of hospital care as well as social services for home-based care. Studies have elaborated the symptoms encountered by the dying child as loneliness, fear of death, irritability and dullness. Despite interventions, satisfactory control was seldom achieved [4, 5] .",

This retrospective regret was more common with families opting hospital as EOLC place (P = 0.03) and also in families with selffinanced treatment (P = 0.179) (Tables 5). Pain was noted to be significantly more observed symptoms in the home-based EOLC group (P = 0.020) and respiratory distress was the most bothersome symptom among the admitted group (Table 6) . Admitted children had easy access to medicinal remedies for their symptoms and 54% parent expressed their perception as near satisfactory for the control of symptoms temporarily. The hospital-based EOLC group regretted its decision with reasons-uncontrolled pain, fearfulness of child regarding the hospital environment and child's unfulfilled desire to be at home. The home-based EOLC group regretted its decision with reasons-uncontrolled pain and non-availability of medical help at home (Table 7) . Only 3 patients that opted for home-based EOLC were visited by health care worker during terminal care. On univariate analysis using the Pearson chisquare test, only living in a rental house was significantly associated with the choice of home-based EOLC (Table 8 ).",

EOLC is needed in about 675,000 cancer cases and 25% of diagnosed paediatric cancer cases [11, 12] . Approach for care at time of impending death and beyond leads to the concept of end of life palliative care. By the 1980s, this concept got attention in developed and developing world with people expecting a good quality of life even when death is anticipated [13] [14] [15] . India which hosts about one million of the cancer population is severely lacking in all aspects of palliative care and capacity building for it as well [16] . Paediatric palliative care need is different, as a child is not the decision-maker in majority of cases. His expression of symptoms and fear may not be adequately perceived or addressed by the care givers. With the passing of time, his preferences and expectation might change and a hospital-based care might be more dreadful for him. However, recent era [17, 18] . The study also noted majority of self-financed family opted for home-based palliation and they acknowledge financial constrains responsible for their choice. In our study, child's distress and discomfort score, as perceived by parent, was of same grade in hospital-and home-based EOLC. However, temporary relief with medication was noted in a significant proportion of admitted patients, 3/7 participants still regretted the decision of opting hospital as terminal care site and majority were concerned with the restrictive atmosphere, non-segregation, lack of privacy and fear of death in child due to frequent medical and nursing interventions. The 2 families, who opted for ICU care and resuscitation, regretted it later as ventilation and sedation caused separation from their child at the terminal time. Regret was less among home-based EOLC-based parents and mainly limited to unavailability of medical aids for symptom relief. Intensive care supports for terminally ill oncological patients are not uniformly promoted. Lack of consensus among medical fraternity in India has been noted regarding ICU care, ventilator support, withdrawal and policy of no escalation of advanced life support treatment in such cases [19] .",

Community-based palliative care facility is also not available in majority of the states. Kerala, a state in India, established a model primary level palliative care with community participation. This was applauded by the WHO and World Palliative Care Alliance but unfortunately is not being followed by other states of the country [25] .

Secondly, the child's stress perception made by parents might not be accurate. Financial status emerged as a cause for opting home-based care; thus, social acceptance across all the economic strata could not be commented. Moreover, the small number of participants limits the conclusions to be generalised.",
