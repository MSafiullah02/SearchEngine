Under routine circumstances, this makes us invaluable to our colleagues who frequently lack the skills and temperament to address human sexuality. These specialized skills may be less obviously useful in our current crisis. The majority of sexual medicine specialists have knowledge and abilities derived from other training (e.g. urology, obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry) which may have greater immediate utility. We as a body should be ready to expand our non-sexuality focused skills sets. We should be ready to acknowledge our limitations but strive nevertheless to meet the pressing needs of our hospital systems and communities.",
