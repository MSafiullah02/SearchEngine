            "text": "Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the major aetiology of respiratory tract infections. HRV viral load assays are available but limitations that affect accurate quantification exist. We developed a one-step Taqman assay using oligonucleotides designed based on a comprehensive list of global HRV sequences. The new oligonucleotides targeting the 5\u2032-UTR region showed high PCR efficiency (E = 99.6%, R 2 = 0.996), with quantifiable viral load as low as 2 viral copies/\u03bcl. Assay evaluation using an External Quality Assessment (EQA) panel yielded a detection rate of 90%. When tested on 315 human enterovirus-positive specimens comprising at least 84 genetically distinct HRV types/serotypes (determined by the VP4/VP2 gene phylogenetic analysis), the assay detected all HRV species and types, as well as other non-polio enteroviruses. A commercial quantification kit, which failed to detect any of the EQA specimens, produced a detection rate of 13.3% (42/315) among the clinical specimens. Using the improved assay, we showed that HRV sheds in the upper respiratory tract for more than a week following acute infection. We also showed that HRV-C had a significantly higher viral load at 2-7 days after the onset of symptoms (p = 0.001). The availability of such assay is important to facilitate disease management, antiviral development, and infection control.",

However limitations that may hinder accurate quantification were evident in many existing assays, such as the lack of sensitivity to detect a broad array of HRV types 11, 13 and the potential risk of overestimation of viral load, due to the usage of random hexamer 16, 17 . To overcome such limitations, we developed an improved real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay containing newly designed specific oligonucleotides that correspond to a comprehensive list of global HRV sequences from all HRV species and types. The assay was validated by an HRV external quality assessment (EQA) panel 18 and tested on HRV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens recently collected from patients presented with symptoms associated with acute respiratory infections. The performance of the assay was compared to that of a commercially available PCR-based HRV quantification kit. Lastly, we estimated the kinetics of HRV viral load in the upper respiratory tract among HRV species, which showed prolonged viral shedding for more than a week during the symptomatic phase of infection. Collectively, the newly developed real-time RT-PCR assay can be used as a detection and quantification tool that may be essential in assessing disease prognosis, monitoring viral suppression during antiviral treatment, and designing infection control measures.",

Other studies however have shown contradictory findings, where no correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed 25, 26 . Although the use of real-time RT-PCR approach for HRV viral load quantification is common, a number of limitations that may result in inaccurate quantification continue to exist. To tackle these challenges, we developed a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay using specific primers and probe designed based on an updated and comprehensive list of reference sequences. The efficiency of the newly designed assay was estimated from a standard curve plotted using a serially diluted plasmid containing the HRV 5\u2032 -UTR region. A constructed plot of the C T values versus the logarithm of the target concentrations is expected to be linear with a negative slope (\u2212 3.33 for a 10-fold dilution series) when the assay efficiency (E) is 100% 27 . In addition, the plot should also yield a Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of greater than 0.97 28 . In our real-time RT-PCR, with an estimated E = 99.6%, R 2 = 0.996 and a slope of \u2212 3.33 ( Fig. 2A) , the newly designed reagents and protocol are considered efficient and robust. In addition, its performance was further evaluated using the quality assessment panel that yielded a detection rate of 90%, of which one of the educational samples was not captured. PCR amplification of HRV VP4/VP2 gene from this sample also yielded a negative result, suggesting possible very low copy number or absence of HRV in the sample.",

Of the 315 HEV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs, HRV-A was predominantly detected, infecting over 60% of the subjects, followed by HRV-C, HRV-B and other enteroviruses. Remarkably, the assay yielded a 100% (315/315) success rate, detecting all HRV strains of different species (and types) as well as enterovirus D68 and coxsackievirus A21 (Table 1 ). In light of the recent enterovirus D68 outbreaks in various parts of the world 29 , the ability of the newly developed assay to quantify enterovirus D68 viral load in clinical specimens may be of additional value. When compared to the commercially available kit, the newly designed assay, which has a shorter turnaround time, was more robust with improved sensitivity in detecting and quantifying a broad array of HRV types in clinical nasopharyngeal specimens (Fig. 2B ). In addition, due to its ability to detect other non-HRV enteroviruses, we went on to test the assay on a collection of archived specimens (collected between 1997 and 2013) of diverse non-polio enteroviruses that have been associated with various human diseases. Interestingly, the assay was able to detect and quantify these specimens, which consist of human enterovirus A71 (n = 9), coxsackieviruses (A6, A16, and B1-B5) (n = 29), and echoviruses (E6, E7, E11, and E19) (n = 6), yielding a success rate of 100% (viral load data not shown).

            "text": "Given the extensive genetic diversity and the growing evidence that associates HRV with more severe lower respiratory tract infections, the development of an improved real-time RT-PCR for HRV detection and quantification is relatively timely, highlighting its clinical importance and potential application as a diagnostic tool for respiratory illnesses. The increased sensitivity and accuracy in estimating HRV viral load is essential especially in the attempt to establish the impact of HRV viral load on the risk of more severe lower respiratory tract complications such as the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbation 30 . Furthermore, such assay may also be useful in monitoring HRV viral load in clinical trials of potential antiviral candidates e.g. vapendavir or pleconaril 31 , thus determining the effectiveness of the treatment. Likewise, the availability of the improved quantification assay enables better understanding of HRV pathogenesis through the duration of viral shedding during acute respiratory infections. Previous study revealed that following a 2-day incubation period 32 , HRV sheds for approximately 10 days in the upper respiratory compartment following acute infection, of which the duration of respiratory tracts symptoms correlates with the duration of virus shedding 33 . Since 25 out of 32 of the study subjects had detectable viral load 14 days after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 3A) , our data suggest that HRV could potentially shed in the respiratory tract of some individuals longer than previously reported, implying that viral transmission could still occur during the second week of infection. Therefore, optimized infection control measures as well as the course of treatment should be implemented and extended accordingly to minimize onward transmission of HRV during this period. However, since several HRV types can circulate simultaneously in the population, sequential or mixed infections by another HRV strain(s) following primary infection are not uncommon 34 , contributing to an increase in viral load. Nevertheless, the prolonged shedding of HRV viral load observed in this cohort should warrants further investigation especially among a larger study population. Lastly, our data revealed that HRV-C had a significantly higher viral load than HRV-A and -B, particularly during the 2-7 days after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 3B ). This probably explains the increased disease severity attributed to HRV-C as compared to HRV-A and -B infection as recently reportedly elsewhere 35, 36 . However, such association between HRV species, viral load and the severity of respiratory illness remains debatable 10,24 unless a more comprehensive study involving a more in-depth sampling method spanning a longer recruitment period is conducted.",
