Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile 12 apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact 13 with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of 14 infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of 15 binary \"infected\" or \"uninfected\" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be 16 efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is 17 diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms 18 a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to 19 the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones 20 fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong 21 flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated.",

Note 64 that the bracketed terms are the probabilities of being originally uninfected, and of remaining uninfected 65 after the contact.

Early efforts in China, Singapore, South Korea and other countries involved 31 extensive testing as well as identification and isolation of contacts of infected individuals and mobile-based 32 alerts [13] . Several governments have also experimented with mobile contact-tracing applications. At we accomplish this via a recursive function, avoiding cycling back to a previous contact by passing 88 an \"ignore list\" of contacts in each function call. Additionally, if a contact was met multiple times 89 in the relevant timeframe, an update is performed the same number of times, since each meeting 90 carried a risk. 91 6. Each individual A's contacts older than m days drop off the contact list, but this does not change 92 p A . That is, if B, who last met A more than m days ago, is diagnosed infected, this is unlikely to 93 require updating p A . 94 7. Individuals who are recovered are marked as as immune. They play no further part in our simulation. 95 In the real world, some instances of re-infection within a short time frame have been noted ([5] , and 96 additional cases reported in news media). 97 Simulation 98 We simulate an agent-based model on a network, in which agents interact stochastically over time and 99 are categorized as \"susceptible\", \"exposed\", \"infectious\", and \"recovered\". These are the categorizations 100 of the compartmental SEIR model in epidemiology, discussed and compared in the next subsection. We 101 implement the risk update algorithm on the same agent-based framework and compare the risk profile 102 predicted by our algorithm with the actual infections of the agent-based simulations. 103 We initialize a population of size N , whose individuals are nodes on a weighted network. The network 104 represents all possible contacts in this population: a link indicates two people who may make a contact, 105 and the weight of the link is the probability of their making a contact at a given time. We consider 106 random networks with uniform degree distribution and uniform link weights, Barab\u00e0si-Albert-structured 107 networks, and networks with family structures and small-world features. Our results are consistent across 108 all these structures. A key parameter of the network, used below, is the average number of contacts per 109 node, defined as",

This is argued[9, 3] to be an effective way to control the outbreak 283 and build \"digital herd immunity\".

Our results are robust to loss in detection of contacts, 287 which is expected to be significant in real life.

For this 192 \"fully connected\" or \"complete\" network, the SEIR model, with parameters determined as in thefigure 193caption, shows excellent agreement with our simulation. The unrealistic assumption here is that each 194 member of the population meets each other member exactly once per epoch; we exhibit it to demonstrate 195 the agreement with a well-mixed SEIR model, but do not explore this network further.196Realistic network: Comparison with SEIR model and Gillespie simulation197    We construct a more realistic network as follows. We initialize a random network with family links, such198 that every individual belongs to a family of size 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (with relative probabilities 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 199 0.1). Family networks are complete, i.e., all members are connected to all others with weight 1. Then, 1% 200 of the individuals are randomly selected, and each is connected to 1000 other individuals, with weight 0.1. 201 These are meant to indicate \"spreaders\", that is, people such as shop attendants and receptionists who 202 have a large number of daily contacts that vary every day. Further links are added via a modification of 203 the Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) algorithm[2], that is, each node is attached to a randomly selected other node 204 with weight 0.1. In the BA algorithm the new node is selected from all other nodes with a probability 205proportional to their coordination numbers. For efficiency, we first select 1000 random other nodes, and 206 then select from those using the BA method.",
