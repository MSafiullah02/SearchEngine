Since December 2019, a number of pneumonia patients with COVID-19 infection have been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have also been found in other parts of China and worldwide. At present, most of the reported cases have a history of residence or travel in Wuhan, and no case of travel history in Wuhan has been found in some areas. NCP is officially declared a public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 by WHO. NCP has been included in the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. Simultaneously, prevention and control measures for class A infectious diseases are taken and implemented. In China, as of 10 AM on May 3, 2020, a total of 84,393 cases have been confirmed, 78,939 cases have been cured and 4643 cases have died, with a mortality rate of 5.50%. NCP has spread all over the world and posed a major threat to human health. There is no vaccine or specific effective drugs for COVID-19 infected pneumonia at present.

COVID-19, which belongs to the category of \"pestilence\" and \"epidemic disease\" in TCM, has the pathogenesis characteristics of \"dampness, poison, blood stasis and closure\", and presents the syndrome of \"dampness poisoning heat and poisoning lung collaterals\" in the progressive stage of pneumonia [1] . The theory of syndrome differentiation characterized by defensive energy nutrients and blood shows its unique advantages in guiding the clinical prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases with unknown characteristics and strong infectivity. It provides an effective treatment scheme for infectious diseases such as SARS, H1N1, H7N9, and has been internationally recognized [2] [3] [4] . Viral infectious disease is called epidemic disease in TCM. It is an acute febrile disease caused by pathogenic qi disease invading the human body through mouth, nose or muscle surface. It belongs to the category of febrile disease. TCM emphasizes the overall concept, syndrome differentiation and treatment, which can not only be treated, but also can be prevented, especially in the improvement of body symptoms, which has unique advantages. In the novel coronavirus campaign, TCM is playing a new therapeutic role in different stages of NCP, that is, \"supporting the healthy and eliminating the evil, and keeping the same strain\", \"syndrome differentiation and treatment to change strain\", restraining \"cytokine storm\", and controlling the serious development of the disease, reducing the sequelae caused by hormones and other drugs, decreasing the fatality rate of patients, and so on. The strategy of \"TCM is added to the main battlefield of anti-epidemic\" is implemented, and the clinical curative effect of the existing Chinese medicine preparation or decoction is observed. Currently, the conventional treatment plus TCM plan has been integrated and published, forming a unified, highly directive and practical \"integrative medicine for the prevention and treatment of NCP\".",

Clinical evidence suggests that QBD can be used in the treatment of a variety of viral infectious diseases, which can relieve symptoms with a good clinical effect. Pharmacological studies show that the antiviral effect of QBD is mainly associated with Gardeniae Fructus, Coptidis Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, and Scrophulariae Radix, which have obvious inhibitory effect on many kinds of influenza viruses via repressing virus replication and preventing virus from entering cells.

It is common in pneumonia, septicemia, sepsis, infectious mononucleosis and so on in modern medicine. Among them, sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the body's dysfunctional response to infection [11] [12] [13] . QBD has effects on relieving sepsis fever, inhibiting early inflammatory reaction, improving blood coagulation dysfunction, and reducing organ function damage, also effectively improving patients' clinical symptoms, ameliorating patients' prognosis and so on [14] [15] [16] . Nowadays, extensive studies have shown that QBD combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of sepsis can effectively ameliorate the clinical symptoms of patients, reduce or inhibit systemic inflammatory reaction, protect the function of various organs and systems, and improve the prognosis of patients. Conventional therapy combined with QBD in the treatment of sepsis (syndrome of flaring heat in qifen and xuefen) has effects on reducing the serum immunological indexes such as IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, CRP and TNF-\u03b1, reducing Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, as well as improving the effective rate of clinical treatment with good clinical effect, which is worth popularizing in clinical [17, 18] .",

The results indicate that QBD can increase the total clinical effective rate of patients with sepsis coagulation dysfunction from 74.2% of the basic treatment to 93.9%. Also, QBD can also significantly decrease the TCM clinical symptom score, APACHE II score and sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA). These results indicate that QBD combined with routine treatment can significantly improve the clinical symptoms and blood coagulation function indexes of sepsis patients, ameliorate patient's health status and protect internal organs [19] . Xi et al. [20] used QBD plus routine treatment to investigate its effect on patients with sepsis with pathogen invading lung defense syndrome. The APACHE II score, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, TCM syndrome score, blood glucose and antipyretic time were significantly improved in the integrated group, and there was no obvious manifestation of organ failure. It shows that QBD can significantly improve the clinical symptoms and shorten the course of disease. Lin et al. [21] established sepsis model in rats by Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). It was found that the mechanism of QBD in treating sepsis was related to regulating the expression of genes related to IL-17 signal pathway in rat spleen. Yi et al. [22] established sepsis model by intravenous injection of colibacillus endotoxin into rabbit ear vein. It was found that QBD reduced systemic inflammation in septic rabbits by regulating TLR4/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. Wang et al. [23] found that the physiological and pathological conditions of septic acute lung injury (ALI) in QBD rats were significantly better than those of the model group (including pathological injury, pathological score, respiratory function, mental state and mortality, etc.), and the expressions of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, IKK\u03b1 and NF-\u03baBp65 protein in lung tissue of rats in QBD group were significantly down-regulated. It is suggested that QBD can exert its protective effect by inhibiting the continuous activation of JAK2/ STAT3 and IKK\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway, and its down-regulating effect is significantly related to the improvement of physiological and pathological conditions in rats with ALI. In addition, it can effectively inhibit the lung tissue inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) and its mediated JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway in septic ALI rats. In addition, QBD could improve the negative feedback regulation mechanism of this pathway, and have a protective effect on ALI model rats [24] . The effects of QBD on lung pathology and the expression of nuclear factor-\u03baBp65 (NF-\u03baBp65) in rats with ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were observed to explore the therapeutic effect and intervention mechanism of QBD on ALI. The results showed that QBD could reduce the degree of lung injury induced by LPS in ALI rats, the accumulation, infiltration and exudation of inflammatory cells in the lungs to a certain extent, playing a definite role in lung protection. QBD can effectively reduce the expression of NF-\u03baBp65 in the lung tissue of ALI rats induced by LPS. It could reduce the \"cascade\" reaction of inflammation by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as inhibiting the inflammatory reaction. The use of QBD in the early stage of ALI induced by LPS can effectively reduce the injury course of lung tissue and the inflammatory reaction, as well as preventing the occurrence and development of inflammation [25] .",

Therefore, it can be known that QBD has significant antiviral effect, which is related to the large doses of Forsythiae Fructus, Scutellariae Radix, and Gardeniae Fructus and so on. By observing the efficacy of QBD in the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia, the results showed that the total effective rate of QBD treatment group (96.0%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (70.0%). And the serum levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and CRP in the QBD were lower than those in the control group, while the level of IL-10 was higher than that in the control group.

It shows that QBD can reduce the inflammatory reaction and improve the symptoms of patients, which is of great significance in the prevention and treatment of influenza A H1N1 viral pneumonia. TCM not only has the effect of multi-link anti-influenza A virus, but also can adjust the immune state of the body, improve the antiviral ability, enhance the stability of the tissue itself, reduce the excessive inflammatory reaction of the body, and protect the cell tissue. QBD plays a significant role in reducing fever, reducing temperature, relieving cough and removing phlegm, improving symptoms and other effects, and its curative effect is easy for patients to accept, which reflects the advantages of TCM compound prescription in the treatment of multipathway, multi-link and multi-target, and is of great significance to effectively control the epidemic situation of influenza A H1N1 [15, 40] .",

Wang et al.

QBD can effectively decrease the relative protein expression of NF-\u03baB p65 in ALI rats induced by LPS. By inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines, the inflammatory response of rat lung tissue can be reduced. Early application of QBD can effectively reduce the degree of lung injury and the inflammatory response of alveoli. Zhang et al. [62] found that QBD reduced the degree of congestion and edema of pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Wang et al. [24] used endotoxin to establish sepsis ALI. The results indicated that pathological type II alveolar cell injury score of observation data significantly reduced in QBD group. In addition, QBD could significantly alleviate the alveolar pathological damage in endotoxin-induced ALI in rats. The results showed that the alveolar structure of QBD group was relatively complete, and the consolidation of alveoli, infiltration of inflammatory cells and edema in alveoli were alleviated in varying degrees.",

Most of the collected clinical cases were treated with conventional therapy combined with QBD. The course of treatment was generally about 7 days, which could significantly improve the clinical efficiency. For the treatment of sepsis, the influence of QBD on the APACHE II score, TCM symptom score, serum immunology index, serum PT, APTT, TT and PLT values, mortality and safety of the patients was focused. As sepsis patients have obvious immune dysfunction, QBD can play a role in treating sepsis by regulating the immunological index, and the clinical effect is better than that of the conventional treatment group. Relevant detection indicators of other diseases are shown in Table 2 .",

From the theory of TCM to modern clinical and pharmacological studies, it has been shown that QBD combined with modern medical conventional treatment has therapeutic effect on viral infection related diseases, and its mechanism includes inhibition of virus, infection related inflammation and improvement of disease-related symptoms. QBD has therapeutic effect on a variety of virus (influenza virus [40, 43, 45] . It is a clinical goal for the body to remove the virus from the body's immune system. Pharmacological studies show that QBD and its components have significant antiinflammatory effects, which can inhibit inflammatory exudation, reduce the levels of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, and regulate the inflammatory related NF-\u03baB/p65, JAK2/STAT3, TLR4 pathways. It is suggested that NCP can alleviate inflammation in QBD, protect organs from inflammation and slow down the progress of inflammation. In addition, QBD could improve the symptoms of fever and diarrhea associated with viral infection, suggesting that QBD may also improve the symptoms of new crown pneumonia. The pharmacological effect and multi-target mechanism of QBD in the treatment of various diseases are shown in Fig. 1 .",

However, excessive inflammatory reaction can lead to more serious damage to the body than the virus infection itself, and in some cases even lead to the imbalance of immune regulation, the lack of negative feedback and the continuous amplification of positive feedback, and the abnormal increase of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a storm of cytokines, which eventually leads to organ damage, functional failure and even death. COVID-19 patients also experienced a cytokine storm and related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the absence of a specific drug for COVID-19, the clinical goal is to support the treatment and control of inflammation and let the body immune system clear the virus. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not clear. It may be related to the damage of immunity and respiratory epithelial cells caused by COVID-19, and the susceptibility of the body, but regardless of the pathogenesis. It is reported that there is overexpression of inflammatory factors in patients with advanced COVID-19, which leads to cytokine storm [70] . Cytokine storm is considered to be an important factor in the development of viral pneumonia. The roles of cytokines in immune network in promoting disease progression, inducing local inflammation, eliminating infection, regulating cellular and molecular immune response, and regulating tissue repair are very complex [71] . When the immune system is out of balance and cytokines are overexpressed, there will be a cytokine storm, which will cause serious damage to the body, such as diffuse alveolar injury, hyaline membrane formation, fibrin exudation, etc. At the same time, accelerated lung injury, the emergence of more serious pulmonary capillary injury and damage to the immune function of the body, cytokines in the circulatory system will lead to systemic cytokine storm, further lead to systemic organ dysfunction, accompanied by the overexpression of inflammatory factors such as IFN, TNF, IL and so on. Regulating the immune balance in the state of COVID19 and inhibiting the occurrence of cytokine storm will be an important way and mechanism to block the deterioration of the disease.",

QBD and its basic prescription exert the effect of \"detoxifying and cooling blood\", and play a significant therapeutic effect on a variety of viral infections (EB virus, H1N1 influenza virus, SARS virus, EV71, etc.). It may be related to the systematic regulation of inhibition of virus proliferation in the host and excessive expression of host inflammatory response, and is expected to be used in the treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID-19. The specific mechanism of its curative effect may be closely related to the inhibition of COVID-19 invasion into the host for proliferation and the improvement of cytokine storm. The replication cycle of animal virus infection has similarity. With the joint efforts of colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry, it has been found that a number of drugs developed for other viruses can inhibit COVID-19 in vitro [72, 73] . Based on the pharmacological effects of QBD, such as antipyretic, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, regulating immunity and so on, it is commonly used in clinical treatment of infectious diseases, such as sepsis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic encephalitis B and so on, with remarkable curative effect, not easy to relapse and little side effect. As far as the material basis of the prescription is concerned, the future research should not be limited to the application of the whole prescription, but should be flexibly applied. The relevant components and contents can be added or decreased according to the disease, and the combination of TCM and western medicine should be adhered.",

The combination of heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs and drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis can enhance the non-specific anti-infective effect of the former [75] . Modern experimental studies have found that QBD has some pharmacological effects, such as heat-clearing and detoxification, anti-platelet aggregation, reducing blood viscosity, anti-inflammation, analgesia, sedation, antibacterial, antiviral, liver protection, cardiotonic, diuretic and so on [76] . All the heatclearing and detoxifying drugs such as Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Gypsum Fibrosum, Scrophulariae Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Coptidis Rhizoma have certain antiviral ability, which can remove the virus or inhibit its replication, and reduce the inflammatory damage of the virus. Forsythiae Fructus can stimulate mononuclear macrophage system, enhance phagocytosis and promote antibody production; Scrophulariae Radix can prolong the existence time of antibody; Scutellariae Radix can enhance leukocyte phagocytosis, promote lymphocyte transformation and improve immune function. Drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis such as Paeoniae Radix Rubra and Moutan Cortex can not only inhibit cellular immunity and possibly inhibit the extensive toxic effect of T cells, so as to reduce multiple organ damage, but also promote non-specific immunity, antivirus, regulate immunity and so on [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . Moutan Cortex cool blood and dissipate blood stasis, rash, clear camp diathermy to nourish Yin. Scutellariae Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Gardeniae Fructus have effect on protecting liver function and forsythia. Forsythiae Fructus, Scutellariae Radix, and Lophatheri Herba can promote the excretion of endotoxin and virus. All kinds of medicines are compatible, clearing heat and detoxification, activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, replenishing qi and nourishing yin, and by regulating immunity and other effects of antivirus, antipyretic, detoxification and liver protection, so as to achieve the purpose of treatment. It is suggested that QBD can reduce the inflammatory reaction of COVID-19 patients and may have a protective effect on organ damage caused by inflammation. Although there is no complete data on the treatment of COVID-19 by QBD, it is believed that in the near future, the TCM and modern medicine can achieve positive clinical treatment effect and reduce the suffering of patients, improve prognosis and rehabilitation.",

It is speculated that its main role is to reduce the level of inflammation in patients. Simultaneously, it plays a role in inhibiting the replication and infection of virus, inhibiting the concurrent bacterial infection, and improving the immunity of the body. However, there are few researches on the mechanism of QBD's action on human coronavirus. Through the study on the mechanism of QBD's multi-channel anti coronavirus action, we hope to provide new ideas for the clinical treatment of COVID-19, which improve the cure rate of patients infected with COVID-19, reduce their mortality, and further explore the pharmacological effect and phase of QBD.
