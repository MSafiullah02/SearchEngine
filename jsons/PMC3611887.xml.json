            "text": "A key aspect of virus host interactions is viral manipulation of cellular gene expression to maintain conditions conducive for efficient replication. Eukaryotic genes are highly regulated post-transcriptionally by evolving mRNP compositions that influence splicing, export, regulation of translation, subcellular localization and mRNA turnover. These events are often interconnected, e.g., mRNA translation is linked to poly(A) shortening and decay, and the processes share proteins (Chang et al., 2004, Shyu et al., 2008). The composition of mRNPs also determines if the mRNA constituents are translationally competent and able to access and assemble ribosomes, or translationally silenced and unable to access active ribosomal machinery. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNP granules exist. Nuclear granules include cajal bodies, histone locus bodies, nuclear speckles, nuclear stress bodies and paraspeckles (Mao et al., 2011, Caudron-Herger and Rippe, 2012). The function of nuclear mRNP granules ranges from stress responsive granules to those that regulate processing of mRNAs (e.g., histone locus bodies, nuclear speckles and paraspeckles) and non-coding RNAs. This review will focus on cytoplasmic RNA granules because of the high propensity for viruses to modify these granules and recent evidence implicating cytoplasmic RNA granules in innate immunity.",

It has been suggested that there is a cytoplasmic mRNA cycle in which mRNPs rapidly move between active polysomes and silenced compartments of PBs and SGs. This is supported by the observation that SGs and PBs are in equilibrium with actively translating mRNPS, which is indicated by experiments using chemical and genetic blockage of multiple steps in the process of translation initiation and elongation (Mokas et al., 2009; Dang et al., 2006, Kedersha et al., 1999). Furthermore, flux between the different RNA granules has been demonstrated with experiments showing transient docking of SGs and PBs with each other, photobleaching experiments that show rapid turnover of proteins in these RNA granules and that SGs and PBs can share many protein components and specific mRNA moieties (Chang et al., 2004, Kedersha et al., 2005, Anderson and Kedersha, 2008, Shyu et al., 2008, Buchan and Parker, 2009).",

Several other types of RNA granules have been described in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and neurons, that contain various levels of proteins uniquely found in either SG or PBs. Thus, a continuum of RNA granules has been suggested to exist in eukaryotic cells with degrees of similarity to either SG or PBs (Buchan and Parker, 2009).",

            "text": "Stress granules are dynamic structures that quickly form when external stresses are applied to cells and global translation rates decline, and disperse when translation conditions are restored. Thus, SG are mostly thought to contain stalled 43S and 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes and are proposed to serve as temporary repositories for these complexes. In this way, largely preassembled translation complexes can be rapidly released to resume gene expression when cellular stress conditions abate. The scenario most often described for SG formation follows when oxidative, nutrient or heat stress activates one of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases (heme-regulated kinase, HRI; general control non-depressible 2 kinase, GCN2; double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R, PKR; and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, PERK), which phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2 and block translation, forcing an accumulation of the stalled 43S and 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes. Inhibition of the function of eIF4G or eIF4A in translation initiation are also linked to SG formation (Mazroui et al., 2006) and some mechanisms of SG formation can proceed in the absence of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (\nFig. 1) (Dang et al., 2006, Emara et al., 2012, Reineke et al., 2012). As SGs contain hundreds of RNA-interacting proteins and an siRNA screen indicates more than 100 genes are involved in SG assembly, the mechanism of SG formation is likely very complex (Ohn et al., 2008). Yet genetically simple viruses have evolved efficient means to control their formation and function.",

            "text": "Since SGs contain stalled initiation complexes, canonical SGs are defined by the presence of key initiation factors (e.g., eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF3, eIF2, PABP), mRNA and the small ribosome subunit (Kedersha et al., 1999, Kedersha et al., 2005, White and Lloyd, 2011). In addition there are a host of RNA binding proteins such as FMRP, YB1, HuR, and TTP, just to name a few. It is unclear at this point, but presumably any protein that binds mRNA or interacts strongly with mRNPs may be ultimately included in SGs. Many of these are passenger proteins that may not function overtly in SG biology. However, SGs also contain key marker proteins that are linked to their formation, most notably G3BP1, TIA1 and TIAR, TDRD3, HDAC6, Caprin1, as well as others (Tourri\u00e8re et al., 2003, Gilks et al., 2004, Kwon et al., 2007, Solomon et al., 2007, Goulet et al., 2008). It is important to note that not all SGs are equivalent. The composition of SGs has been found to vary depending on the mode of stress that induced them, though the majority of markers that define SG function as repositories of stalled translation complexes are consistent among all types of SG, e.g., translation initiation factors, 40S ribosome subunits, mRNA. For instance, heat shock induced stress granules (HS-SGs) contain heat shock protein 27 (hsp27), but hsp27 is not found in arsenite (Ars)-induced SGs (Kedersha et al., 1999, Gilks et al., 2004, Piotrowska et al., 2010). Virus infection produces unique types of cell stress and can induce SG to form (V-SG). Some V-SGs uniquely contain Sam68 which is not found in HS-SGs (Piotrowska et al., 2010).",

It is possible that other types of transcripts that function during cell stress, e.g., certain IRES-containing mRNAs, are preferentially excluded from SG inclusion. The mechanisms that lead to exclusion of certain transcripts from SGs remain to be determined. Thus, the overall function of aggregation of mRNPs into SGs remains unclear, but likely regulates both mRNA translation and mRNA turnover, and may be linked to signaling pathways (discussed below). Overall, these aggregate functions likely promote increased cell survival during stress conditions and rapid return to homeostasis at stress termination (Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2008).",

P-body constituents include decapping enzymes, exonucleases, deadenylases, RNA binding proteins involved in nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA mediated silencing (\nFig. 2). RNA decay occurs both within PBs and outside PBs and proportions of total RNA decay attributed to each compartment are controversial (Arribere et al., 2011). Recruitment of mRNA to PBs is not an occurrence of non-translation, rather requires active silencing via miRNA or RNAi mechanisms (Eulalio et al., 2007). The molecular mechanism of PB formation is thought to involve aggregation of RNA binding proteins, as well as the mRNA itself as an organizing structure. Consistent with this, PBs disperse in permeablized cells treated with RNase (Eulalio et al., 2007). The human DEAD box helicase RCK/p54 (also called DDX6) may coat and relax mRNA structures before entry into PBs (Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012). Similar to SGs, PBs can contain variable protein makeup in mammalian cell lines and Drosophila, with proteins like PCBP2, Hedls, Xrn1, defining subsets of PBs (Teixeira et al., 2005, Eulalio et al., 2007). PBs are proposed to dynamically exchange mRNP cargo with SGs and have been proposed to serve as nucleation sites for SG formation (Kedersha et al., 2005).",

The degree and type of manipulation employed by viruses is turning out to be as variable as the replication schemes of the viruses themselves and the impact of SGs on virus replication can be wide-ranging. Virus infection induces many types of stresses on cells, even during non-lytic infections, and the perturbation of cellular homeostasis is sensed in many ways in pathways that feed directly into stress responses. An emerging theme is primordial innate immune responses and general stress responses are intimately linked, and interface at many levels. Most outcomes of stress responses serve to sharply curtail or alter host gene expression patterns, usually to the detriment of a virus. Thus, a general trend by viruses is that they block or co-opt stress responses to facilitate efficient replication. To cover the broad range of virus-RNA granule interactions, this review organizes both SG and PB interactions into roughly generalized topics according to current understanding. SG groupings are summarized in\nTable 1. We expect these groupings will require revision as more research emerges.",

Many variations on this theme have been reported already, but few examples exist where fully formed functional SGs (defined as containing stalled translation complexes) have been shown to co-exist within virus infected cells at mid-phase of virus replication cycle when virus gene expression is high. Typically when viruses amplify their gene expression sufficiently, SGs are absent and/or SG components have been co-opted into novel virus-specific structures or roles that are symbiotic with replication processes. Another emerging theme is that PKR is a central sensor of viral stress that drives not only stress granule responses, but also downstream innate immune functions.

The degree of virus production varied in a strain-specific manner, but was linked to variations in virus production of p58IPK, an inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 kinases PKR and PERK. The authors found that high expression of p58IPK correlated with reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and stress granule persistence later in infection (19.5 hpi) (Smith et al., 2006). ATF4 is a transcriptional regulator whose expression is regulated by eIF2\u03b1 because of regulatory upstream open reading frames. Smith et al. suggested that reovirus replication depends on expression of ATF4-induced genes that augment virus replication. Using different reovirus strains, Qin et al. demonstrated that MRV restricts SG formation at a point downstream of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation during late times post infection (24 hpi), but did not draw correlations with p58IPK levels or measure virus titers in the presence and absence of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. As such, there is no confirmation of the observation by Smith and colleagues that SG formation early during infection augments viral replication. However, reoviruses inhibit assembly of stress granules at a fundamental level, since even eIF4A inhibitors, which act independent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, cannot induce SGs late in infection (Qin et al., 2011).",

The mechanism of SG disassembly involves cleavage of the stress granule protein G3BP1, which is mediated by the viral protease 3C (Fig. 1). G3BP1 cleavage separates the N-terminal protein-interacting domain from the C-terminal RNA recognition motif. Expression of a 3C protease cleavage-resistant mutant of G3BP1 rescues stress granules at late times post infection (White et al., 2007). A contradicting study showed that Tia1-containing stress granules persisted even during late times post infection (Piotrowska et al., 2010), but those granules were later shown to be devoid of the stress granule components eIF3, eIF4G and eIF4E indicating that Tia1 granules are remnants of normal stress granules and do not correlate with translational repression (White and Lloyd, 2011). Therefore, poliovirus unlinks Tia1 aggregation from aggregation of translation initiation factors in stress granules. These results reinforce the notion that mRNP granules differ in composition and function and cannot be stereotyped based on some common factors. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation increases during the course of poliovirus infection, similar to the case with MRV. This effectively inhibits cellular protein synthesis so resources can be used for viral RNA translation. Interestingly, poliovirus translation proceeds due to cleavage of eIF5B, which bypasses the need for eIF2\u03b1 during translation initiation (White et al., 2011). It is unclear whether MRV translation can persist during eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by exploiting such a mechanism.",

Inhibition of stress granule formation by IAV depends on expression of the viral protein NS1, as recombinant Influenza A virus expressing a variant of NS1 that does not bind dsRNA stimulates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and SG accumulation. Stress granule formation appears to inhibit IAV replication because accumulation of the viral protein NP is repressed when SGs persist through the infectious cycle (Khaperskyy et al., 2011). Also, PKR knockout cells do not accumulate stress granules late during infection despite the presence of NS1 mutants that induce SG formation (Khaperskyy et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). Together these data suggest that the ability of NS1 to inhibit PKR activity is critical for inhibition of SGs. Furthermore, ablation of NS1 expression in IAV results in formation of stress granules that contain many innate immunity factors including OAS, RNase L and PKR. These granules appear to be important in induction of interferon gene expression implying an importance for antiviral stress granules in priming nearby cells against infection (Onomoto et al., 2012).",

These results indicate that not only do SGs differ in composition depending on the context (discussed above), but even the same virus can interact with SGs and/or the translational apparatus in a cell type-dependent manner (A549 cells versus HeLa). Interestingly, SGs induced from infection with IAV \u0394NS1 appear to be important in induction of interferon gene expression as measured by qPCR of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in control cells or cells depleted of G3BP1, which are impaired in SG formation (Onomoto et al., 2012). The authors went on to show decreased IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in cells devoid of PKR expression despite IAV infection. Although intriguing, these results leave open the possibility that either G3BP or PKR are important for the innate immune response rather than SGs themselves. Indeed, PKR has previously been shown to be required to mount a normal innate immune transcription response (Garcia et al., 2006, Steele et al., 2011, Taghavi and Samuel, 2012).",

The use of eIF2\u03b1 S51A mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts to study the significance of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation on rotavirus replication indicates that the virus replicates better when eIF2\u03b1 cannot be phosphorylated. These results are similar to the case with mouse hepatitis coronavirus which also replicate better in S51A mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (discussed in detail below) (Raaben et al., 2007). These examples highlight the importance of a normal innate immune response for inhibiting the spread of virus, and indicate these viruses reach a balance between eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation during the infection and reduced virus production.

The G3BP1/nsP3-containing foci are not canonical stress granules as they lack the SG marker eIF3. Similarly, Semliki Forest virus nsP3 also sequesters G3BP1 into viral replication complexes and SG formation. In this case a C-terminal domain of nsP3 was mapped to interact with G3BP that was distinct from the Chikungunya SH3 domain (Panas et al., 2012). Further, the efficient translation of viral mRNAs with an enhancer motif also helps disassemble SGs during infection. The precise molecular benefit of subverting G3BP1 to novel replicase complexes is unclear but deletions of the G3BP1-intereacting sequence in nsP3 reduces replication of viral replicons or virus (Fros et al., 2012, Panas et al., 2012).",

Previous work showed G3BP1 also interacted with nsP2 and nsP3, so this may reflect overlapping interactions with a large viral replicase complex (Gorchakov et al., 2008, Frolova et al., 2006). The role of interaction of SV nsP4 with G3BP is unclear as there are only marginal changes in SV RNA levels when both G3BP1 and 2 are depleted. Because G3BP was identified in infected cells without RNase treatment of immunocomplexes to eliminate RNA-dependent interactions, it is possible G3BP actually interacts with the SV RNA and regulates SV translation. This idea is supported by experiments indicating that SV polyprotein production is significantly increased when G3BP is depleted (Cristea et al., 2010). Furthermore, G3BP1 has been shown to regulate translation of some cellular mRNAs (Ortega et al., 2010). If G3BP1 were interacting with the SV RNA, it could be similar to subversion of the SG proteins Tia1 and TIAR by the flaviviruses, as highlighted below, although in that case Tia1 and TIAR play a positive role for Dengue and West Nile Virus. The role of G3BP in SV polyprotein production is paralleled by a 5-fold increase in virus production when G3BP 1 and 2 are depleted. Considering the similarity of Sindbis Virus to SFV and the importance of G3BP1 in SG assembly (White et al., 2007) it is likely that depletion of G3BP1 and 2 abrogates SGs during infection thereby enhancing overall virus production by eliminating the translation block coincident with SG assembly (Fig. 1). Interaction of G3BP with Sindbis Virus nsP3 has not been documented indicating that Sindbis and SFV may differentially co-opt G3BP function, which is surprising considering the similarity of these viruses.",

Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 did not accumulate during infection with a West Nile virus strain from lineage 1, indicating the virus is actively suppressing translational repression. In fact, arsenite induction of stress granules is impaired as viral protein expression increases during the infection (Emara and Brinton, 2007). Increased expression of viral RNA early during WNV infection from a chimeric lineage 1/2 virus W9561C has been documented to activate PKR and induce stress granules (Courtney et al., 2012). Lineage 1 WNV strain Eg101 lacks the robust early viral RNA levels observed with W9561C and has reduced or delayed activation of PKR. These data suggest WNV restricts expression of viral RNA early to avoid induction of the cellular stress response. Li et al. showed that WNV strain Eg101 replication was 6\u20137 fold reduced in cells depleted of TIAR, but not the highly related Tia1 gene. Therefore, native WNV strains likely prevent the SG response in order to subvert TIAR to functions that promote viral RNA replication (Li et al., 2002).",

Furthermore, stress granules are more abundant in HCV infected cells treated with interferon and oscillate during the course of the infection. These oscillations are thought to be critical for viral gene expression because infected cells containing stress granules exhibit translational repression and would otherwise be incapable of expressing viral proteins necessary for chronic HCV infection. Interestingly, no viral gene is expected to induce SG oscillations during HCV infection as SG oscillation was observed with diverse viruses and even transfection of double-stranded RNA. Oscillation in SG abundance is also expected to enhance HCV virion production by liberating SG proteins involved in viral replication and egress. This prediction is based on the observation that several P-body and stress granule proteins are redistributed to lipid droplets during the course of infection, including DDX6 and G3BP1 (Ariumi et al., 2011). In fact, depletion of G3BP1, Tia1, TIAR and PABP, among others, have been described to effect different steps of the HCV lifecycle (Ariumi et al., 2011, Yi et al., 2011, Garaigorta et al., 2012). Although the significance of G3BP1 redistribution is unknown, it was found to colocalize and interact with NS5A and NS5B, two components of the HCV replication complex suggesting G3BP1 may be involved in HCV RNA replication (Yi et al., 2011). However, additional details of the mechanism of G3BP1 involvement in HCV RNA replication have not been elucidated.",

Pbp1 is an ortholog of Ataxin 2, which associates with PABP and enters SGs (Mangus et al., 1998, Buchan et al., 2008). Pbp1 undergoes a self-association to enter SGs, but does so in a complex that pulls TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) into SGs (Takahara and Maeda, 2012). Sequestration of TORC1 in SGs inhibits TORC function, which normally regulates cap-dependent translation in response to growth signaling. Interestingly, mTORC1 controls the latency of HSV-1 in neurons and when active will suppress HSV-1 reactivation. Inhibiting TORC1 with hypoxia stress (that can induce SG that may sequester mTORC1), causes a reactivation of HSV acute replication (Kobayashi et al., 2012). In this way, latent HSV-1 may respond to SG responses to activate acute replication that then suppresses SG responses. It will be interesting to determine if hypoxic stress in cultured neurons in this system actually sequesters mTORC1, completing a linkage between the two studies.",

In fact, stress granule formation induced by oxidative stress is also inhibited, similar to the observation with MRV, SFV and PV. However, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation does accumulate 10 hpi without induction of SGs (Finnen et al., 2012). Strikingly, stress granules containing G3BP1, Tia1 and PABP can be induced in infected cells with the eIF4A inhibitor pateamine A. However, instead of Tia1 localizing to cytoplasmic SG as seen in RNA-virus infected cells, it primarily localizes to discrete nuclear foci that contain Sam68. Even in the presence of pateamine A-induced stress granules, Tia1 predominantly localizes to Sam68-containing nuclear foci (Finnen et al., 2012). The role of the Tia1 nuclear foci is unclear, but unlike examples of G3BP1 redistribution where cells are resistant to SG induction with exogenous stressors, HSV-2-infected cells with Tia1 nuclear foci are still capable of forming SGs. Therefore, it is unlikely that sequestration of Tia1 in nuclear foci is responsible for inhibition of SG formation during infection. These data indicate that Tia1 may be augmenting HSV-2 viral replication or transcription similar to the case for Dengue and West Nile viruses.",

Interestingly, expression of viral proteins N and glycoprotein precursor are sufficient to inhibit stress granule formation, while the matrix protein Z cannot inhibit SG assembly (Fig. 1) (Linero et al., 2011). Another study showed that Junin virus infection subverts some components of stress granules into replication-transcription complexes. G3BP1 colocalizes with the viral protein N, which are thought to augment the infection. However, neither PABP nor Tia1 enter the same foci, which are novel virus-specific foci but not SG. Interestingly, some initiation factors including eIF4G and eIF4A and large and small ribosomal subunit proteins L10a and S6 are also present in replication-transcription complexes. Although initiation factors and the ribosome may participate in translation of the viral RNA in replication-transcription complexes, it is unclear how G3BP may function. It is possible that G3BP1 is recruited to sequester it and disassemble stress granules to enhance Junin virus translation (Baird et al., 2012).",

However, it is unclear whether SG inhibition happens early or later during infection as HIV1 infection was accomplished through transfection of proviral DNA so kinetics of SG formation have not been dissected. The mechanism of SG inhibition appears to be related to sequestration of the stress granule protein Staufen1 to RNPs containing the viral protein Gag and HIV1 viral RNA (Fig. 1) (Abrahamyan et al., 2010). Interestingly, depletion of Staufen1 co-depletes Gag from infected cells and results in enhanced encapsidation of viral mRNA and residual Staufen1. Furthermore, levels of the nonsense-mediated decay factor Upf1 and large ribosomal subunit protein L7 were increased in purified virus assembled in Staufen1 depleted cells. These results indicate that HIV1 prevents stress granule assembly to subvert Staufen1 to alternative RNPs that regulate viral encapsidation. It is unclear whether the virions assembled in Staufen1 depleted cells, which differ in composition from normal virus, are equally infectious.",

Lindquist et al. showed a striking increase in viral protein N production in cells containing stress granules. In cells that were genetically deficient for SG formation by knockdown of G3BP1, there was a 10-fold reduction in RSV titer, consistent with the observation that viral protein production is impaired in cells lacking stress granules. These results are reminiscent of results from the vaccinia virus system where, under some conditions, SG-like aggregates promote virus replication (discussed below) (Katsafanas and Moss, 2007). However, these viruses are clearly from different families and no association between RSV viral inclusion bodies and stress granules was observed in these studies (Lindquist et al., 2010, Lindquist et al., 2011). A contradictory study using the RSV system showed that stress granule formation was inhibited specifically by the trailer region of the viral genome (Hanley et al., 2010). However, this was consistent with earlier studies with Sendai virus, which is similar to RSV, and its trailer blocks SG formation during infection (Iseni et al., 2002). Previous work has documented a role for the trailer region in synthesis of progeny genomes. Hanley et al. showed that replacement of the trailer with a sequence complimentary to the 5\u2032 leader resulted in robust SG formation. However, an unspecified eIF3 subunit was used as the only marker of stress granule formation, leaving the possibility that SG-like proviral structures form, which lack that eIF3 subunit, in a trailer-dependent manner.",

Localization of these components of stress granules was suggested to result from coordinated transcription and translation in the replication factory rather than assembly of bona fide stress granules in the vicinity of the replication factory (Katsafanas and Moss, 2007). Caprin1 and G3BP1 interact with each other and regulate transcription of the VV genome (Katsafanas and Moss, 2004, Solomon et al., 2007). Coordinated transcription and translation agrees with recent data indicating eIF4G is recruited to single-stranded viral DNA by the action of the viral protein I3 (Zaborowska et al., 2012). In a separate study, aggregation of translation initiation factories in and around virus factories were shown to be devoid of the translational suppressor Tia1 (Walsh et al., 2008). These results indicate VV subverts several components of stress granules for proviral roles in replication factories.",

            "text": "A recent study has documented the colocalization of SG components (Tia1, eIF3b, G3BP1 and Usp10) in foci surrounding VV factories using cells infected with \u0394E3L mutant vaccinia virus and suggested the SG components in \u201cantiviral\u201d granules can block virus replication in some circumstances (Simpson-Holley et al., 2011). E3L inhibits PKR activation and therefore prevents translational repression due to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation; which is consistent with the observation that PKR activation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and global translation arrest are necessary for formation of \u201cantiviral\u201d granules with E3L mutant virus (Simpson-Holley et al., 2011). These granules differ from canonical SGs in that they lack ribosomal subunits and are not dispersed by cycloheximide, but like SGs, they are formed in response to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Because of the different properties they were termed \u201cantiviral granules\u201d (Simpson-Holley et al., 2011). Further, these authors did not find G3BP1-foci in wild type VV infected cells, but only in cells with translation and replication inhibition (E3L mutant virus). These results present a discrepancy with the previous study suggesting proviral roles for SG components in viral factories (Katsafanas and Moss, 2007). The authors explain the conflicting results by saying that the proviral granules previously documented (i) lacked Tia1, (ii) were present within viral factories whereas \u201cantiviral\u201d granules form surrounding virus factories, and (iii) \u201cantiviral\u201d granules require eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation whereas the proviral SG aggregates correlate with ongoing translation. Although a clear distinction has been made regarding the nature of proviral and \u201cantiviral\u201d granules, several questions remain. First, are the granules observed in each study the same, and why were not proviral granules observed in infections by wild type vaccinia virus by Simpson\u2013Holley et al.? Second, is translation occurring in either proviral aggregates or the \u201cantiviral\u201d stress granule-like structures surrounding VV replication factories? These questions could be addressed using new technologies to visualize active translation at the single-cell level (Reineke et al., 2012, David et al., 2011, Dieterich et al., 2006). Third, if these mRNPs are modified stress granule structures and not sites of active translation, is translation repressed throughout the cell when \u201cantiviral\u201d granules are present as suggested by studies with \u0394E3L mutant VV? And finally, are \u201cantiviral\u201d granules really distinct from stress granules or just morphologically distinct because of virus-induced alterations in cellular processes?",

This is an understudied area given that RNA viruses must regulate RNA decay processes/machinery that are concentrated within these RNA granules to prevent degradation of virus genomes, templates and mRNAs. However, early interest in the relationship between P-body components and some viruses has occurred because gene expression is closely linked to these structures. As one might expect, the emerging picture of the relationship between viruses and P-bodies appears as varied as with stress granules. We have loosely grouped the relationships into broad categories that will likely require revision as more research findings are produced (\nTable 2).

            "text": "Several viruses appear to disperse PBs and PB components during the course of infection, however details of mechanisms involved are sparse. The flavivirus West Nile virus, which sequesters Tia1 on viral RNA, causes a progressive decline in the numbers of PBs in cells (Emara and Brinton, 2007). WNV also relocalizes many P-body components, including Lsm1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and Xrn1, to viral replication centers (Chahar et al., 2012). Localization of at least some of these components to WNV replication centers is important for RNA replication because siRNA-mediated depletion of Ago2, DDX3, Dicer, Lsm1 and GW182 all result in coincident reductions in viral RNA (Chahar et al., 2012). Localization of these P-body components to WNV replication centers may be due to interaction with viral genomic RNA. Indeed, with another flavivirus, Dengue virus genomic RNA binds DDX6 (Rck/p54) at a conserved stem loop structure in the 3\u2032 UTR. Interaction of Dengue RNA with stress granule proteins G3BP1, USP10 and caprin1 occurs at an adjacent unstructured region of the 3\u2032 UTR (Ward et al., 2011). The interaction with DDX6 is expected to be important since DDX6 knockdown reduced virus replication presumably through this interaction. Thus, Dengue and possibly West Nile virus can co-opt critical PB proteins for virus replication, and may interfere with their role in PB assembly.",

During Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) infection, the sfRNA corresponds to a portion of the 3\u2032 UTR of the genomic transcript generated by stalling of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonunucleolytic decay by Xrn1 at pseudoknot 3 (Silva et al., 2010). Previous evidence indicates that the sfRNA does colocalize with Xrn1 in P-bodies, and its production is important for cytopathogenicity of the flavivirus Kunjin Virus (Pijlman et al., 2008). Although, the effect of the sfRNA on P-body integrity during infection was not examined for YFV, disruption of pseudoknot 3 and subsequent depletion of the sfRNA did not effect YFV viral titers (Silva et al., 2010). Furthermore, the consequences of depletion of Xrn1 on virus yield were not examined for YFV. More recent results indicate that sfRNA inhibits Xrn1 activity, resulting in accumulation of uncapped cellular mRNAs in cells (Moon et al., 2012). sfRNA also exhibits RNAi suppressor activity and can inhibit cleavage of dsRNA by Dicer (Schnettler et al., 2012). Thus, sfRNA has emerging roles in inhibiting host nucleases involved in gene regulation and innate immunity. These roles may indirectly affect RNA granule function.",

P-bodies were found to decrease in number by about a third in conjunction with this relocalization, but did not disappear. The adenovirus E4 11k protein drives this reorganization and was found to interact with DDX6 (Rck/p54), which may facilitate this process (Greer et al., 2011). E4 11k has many roles in controlling innate immunity and also relocalizes promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) from nuclear PML bodies to unique elongated structures associated with virus replication centers. Thus, this virus protein can be seen to reorganize both cytoplasmic and nuclear structures while controlling host responses to infection (Greer et al., 2011).",

The APOBEC3 family provides innate immune functions against HIV and contains seven proteins, four of which have anti-HIV1 functions and are targeted by viral Vif protein for degradation (Fig. 2). Two APOBEC3 members, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G, interact with many RNA binding proteins, including the RISC protein Ago2, Dcp1a, Dcp2 and DDX6, and thus enter PBs (Kozak et al., 2006, Gallois-Montbrun et al., 2007). Argonaute proteins involved in miRNA repression also localize to PBs and interact with APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G (Gallois-Montbrun et al., 2007, Gallois-Montbrun et al., 2008). Antiviral activities of APOBEC3 proteins take place at multiple stages of the viral replication cycle, including promiscuous packaging of APOBEC3 into virions where its deaminase function damages viral genomes, thus inhibiting the next cycle of infection (Wang et al., 2008). Inclusion of APOBEC3 into PBs was not required for this antiviral packaging step indicating APOBEC3 family members do not alter HIV-1 virion production in a P-body-dependent manner.",

However, the antiviral effect of APOBEC3G and other APOBEC family members was not attributed to regulation of miRNA-mediated repression of HIV-1 translation (Nathans et al., 2009). As APOBEC proteins have been shown to confer antiviral activity, interact with P-body proteins and localize to P-bodies, interaction of HIV-1 mRNA with P-bodies was examined (Nathans et al., 2009, Phalora et al., 2012). While neither HIV-1 Gag RNA nor Gag protein could be detected in P-bodies in one study (Phalora et al., 2012), HIV-1 mRNA was shown to interact with P-body proteins APOBEC3G, Ago2 and DDX6 and colocalize P-bodies in another (Nathans et al., 2009). This discrepancy may be due to artifacts associated with tethering of MS2-GFP fusion proteins to the 3\u2032 UTR of the Gag mRNA. Phalora and colleagues showed depletion of Lsm1 and DDX6 did not rescue the antiviral effect of APOBEC3G expression. However, Nathans et al. showed ablation of expression of Lsm1 and DDX6 caused an increase in viral production and infectivity by 2\u20133 fold in the absence of APOBEC3G overexpression. These results indicate APOBEC3G may act downstream of Lsm1 and DDX6 in the HIV-1 lifecycle. Despite the discrepancy between these results, both studies showed that knockdown of Ago proteins increase viral infectivity. Nathans et al. went on to show knockdown of other components of the siRNA pathway including Dicer and Drosha resulted in increased HIV-1 viral infectivity. It remains unclear whether the results observed in these studies are due to decreased function of miRNAs on the virus, as suggested by Drosha, Dicer and miR-29a depletion, or due to the depletion of P-bodies and associated functions from the cell as suggested by DDX6, Lsm1 or Ago proteins (Phalora et al., 2012, Nathans et al., 2009).",

Another report mostly concurred, but found overexpression inhibits retrovirus replication, primarily at the reverse transcriptase stage, for both HIV and murine leukemia virus. Curiously, depletion of Mov10 also inhibited replication modestly (Burdick et al., 2010, Furtak et al., 2010). Virus inhibitory activity of Mov10 was mapped to the N-terminus of Mov10 rather than the putative helicase domain indicating the helicase activity of Mov10 is required.

Interestingly, not all PB components are co-opted into these new structures, e.g., Dcp2 remained in foci reminiscent of endogenous PBs and did not colocalize with new viral structures (Ariumi et al., 2011). Although HCV is clearly interfering with canonical PBs, retention of Dcp2 suggests an alternate vestigial structure may be retained, analogous to Tia1 pseudo-SG foci that persist in poliovirus infected cells (White and Lloyd, 2011).

DDX6, PatL1 and the Lsm1\u20137 heptameric ring play essential roles in the HCV life cycle at the translational and RNA replication levels (Scheller et al., 2009, Jangra et al., 2010). Lsm1 and DDX6 interact with HCV viral RNA directly, but given the interplay of PB components with HCV replication, it is unclear if PB foci per se inhibit or influence HCV replication. Recent work suggests they do not inhibit HCV as PB knockdown by siRNA depletion of Rap55 did not alter HCV replication or influence HCV protein levels (P\u00e9rez-Vilar\u00f3 et al., 2012). HCV may hijack DDX6 for RNA packaging, which has been observed previously for the spumaretrovirus foamy virus (Yu et al. 2011). Together these data suggest that HCV co-opts certain PB constituents for replicative functions; however, there is no requirement for PB foci in HCV replication (Fig. 2). The converse experiment to examine the whether stabilization of PBs during infection has an inhibitory effect on replication has not been tested. Finally, unlike more rapidly growing and lytic enteroviruses, HCV does not seem to rely on cleavage and degradation of PB components by virus proteases.",

Unlike influenza, Bunyaviruses such as Hantavirus replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. To facilitate this process, Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) binds tightly to the 5\u2032 cap of cellular mRNAs and accumulates in PBs to prevent decapping/degradation from Dcp1a/Dcp2 complexes (Fig. 2). The sequestered and protected 5\u2032 caps are then utilized to prime virus mRNA synthesis (Mir et al., 2008). An important feature is that PBs naturally can exchange/release bound mRNP cargo back to the cytoplasm. This is required for Hantavirus transcripts to reenter the soluble cytoplasmic milieu to engage ribosomes to translate virus proteins. It will be interesting to determine if Hantavirus accelerates PB content flux to facilitate release of virus transcripts. The ability of Hantavirus N protein to bind caps, thus excluding eIF4E/eIF4F interaction, may play a role in preferential transport of virus transcripts out of PBs (Mir and Panganiban, 2008). This mechanism would involve subverting P-body function, rather than specific PB components, for generating capped viral mRNAs that could then be preferentially translated.",

The viral protein SOX was recently shown to induce endonucleolytic cleavage of cellular RNAs at TGAAG motifs (Covarrubias et al., 2011). This cleavage event generates unprotected 5\u2032 end intermediates that are then turned over by the P-body component Xrn1. Cleavage intermediates accumulate in 40S translation preinitiation complexes indicating that SOX may bind or be activated in these complexes. However, neither movement of the ribosome over the SOX cleavage site nor ribosome subunit joining are believed to be required for activity of SOX on its substrates (Covarrubias et al., 2011). Therefore, a detailed mechanism of SOX activity is still needed. One point for clarification is whether all cellular mRNAs contain enough of a consensus motif to trigger endonucleolytic cleavage by SOX or if degradation of the most highly translated cellular mRNAs is sufficient \u201chost shutoff\u201d for ongoing viral RNA translation. It will also be important to investigate the proportion of Xrn1 involved in SOX-induced degradation of cellular mRNAs and whether removal of Xrn1 from P-bodies during gammaherpesvirus infection results in P-body disassembly.",

PB constituent proteins affect BMV replication in two ways. First, genetic screens indicated the Lsm1p-7p complex, Pat1p and Dhh1p (Rck/p54, DDX6) were all required for efficient translation of all the virus mRNAs. Second, the same proteins were also required for entry of viral RNA into replication complexes on membranes (Noueiry et al., 2003). Since these proteins are generally associated with translation repression, it is unclear how they stimulate BMV translation; however; a role in the switch from active translation to RNA replication is possible, which requires clearing viral RNA templates of ribosomes. Interestingly, viral RNA and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which complexes with Lsm1p, was observed to enter PBs (Beckham et al., 2007). Also, some PBs can associate with membranes where viral replication complexes are built (Wang et al., 2005, Beckham et al., 2007). It will be interesting to determine if PBs interact at any level with membranes such as autophagic vesicles that are co-opted by RNA viruses to anchor RNA replication complexes.",

However, virus infection induces host stress responses at multiple levels, thus cellular stress sensors may be part of virus sensing mechanisms used to activate innate immune functions.

This provides a link between the formation of a stress granule alone and PKR activation (Reineke et al., 2012). It is unclear how PKR is activated by stress granules and whether other components of the PKR signaling axis are also activated. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is a transcription factor involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Ghosh et al., 1998). PKR activity has been linked to NF-kB translocation to the nucleus and subsequent transcriptional activation (Gil et al., 2001). Consistent with those results, PKR directly interacts with the IkB kinase complex, which phosphorylates IkB and induces dissociation of IkB from NF-kB thereby inducing NF-kB transcriptional activation (Gil et al., 2001, Bonnet et al., 2000).",

This indicates that cells naturally concentrate interferon response activating proteins together with stress granule proteins. Functional linkage of the granule-based sensing mechanism to the interferon response was shown by a loss of IFN\u03b2 mRNA production by depletion of PKR or G3BP1, the latter of which depletes SGs. PKR was also found to enter stress granules, bringing together, in a concentrated fashion, many components of the innate immune response and viral RNA, which entered granules in the IAV \u0394NS1 virus. PKR has also been shown to enter P-bodies during human papilloma virus infection (Hebner et al., 2006). Further, PKR was shown to have a critical role in the formation of SG in influenza infection as SGs did not form in PKR knockout MEFs, a phenotype observed with many other viruses (Khaperskyy et al., 2011, Onomoto et al., 2012). One feature of the influenza-induced antiviral stress granules in this study was the inclusion of virus RNA in the granule, but this only occurred with IAV \u0394NS1 virus, not wild type IAV (Onomoto et al., 2012). Studies with wild type poliovirus indicate that viral RNA does not enter virus-induced stress granules (Piotrowska et al., 2010); thus, inclusion of viral RNA in these structures is variable depending on the virus and is likely counteracted by viral proteins. Together, these studies raise the possibility that activation of other stress signaling pathways is mediated by stress granules. Indeed, the stress-responsive MAPK JNK is activated in a noncanonical manner during stress granule formation (Wasserman et al., 2010).",

Although it is clear that RNA granules negatively regulate many viruses, the scope of viruses regulated by RNA granules is not completely understood. Additionally, the number of mechanisms employed by viruses to subvert RNA granule function appears nearly as great as the number of different virus families, but details of the mechanisms involved remain murky. Several virus systems described above may sequester RNA granule components, but in all cases, the real role of those components in RNA granule assembly and function is unclear. As such, viruses are excellent probes of cellular biology and regulation of RNA granules by viruses poses an opportunity to understand more about mechanisms behind RNA granule biology. Furthermore, all stress granules are not identical, so the persistence of one type of granule during infection does not mean that a functional SG or PB is present in the cell. Thus it is not only important to follow multiple components of each granule during infection, but to examine the functional consequences of RNA granule persistence, e.g., translational repression for SGs and RNA stability for PBs. Finally, the emerging concept that SG formation signals downstream stress signals that activate innate antiviral mechanisms as part of an integrated stress response should receive more attention. As stress responses and innate immunity likely crosstalk at multiple levels, it is possible that RNA granule biology may be exploited as a broad spectrum antiviral strategy.",

Virus infection causes stress at multiple levels that reduces host translation through activation of eIF2 kinases or other means and converts active polysome mRNPs into stalled translation initiation complex mRNPs. A complex series of events involving nucleation of several stress granule proteins such as G3BP1, Tia-1/TIAR, and HDAC6 plus transport on microtubules leads to aggregates of translation initiation complex mRNPs in stress granules. Specific points/proteins where viruses interact with and inhibit or divert the RNA granule assembly pathway are shown. Several viral proteins (VPs) interact with G3BP1 in complexes, some of which localize to novel viral foci. Note that many viruses control PKR activation; only those discussed in the text are indicated.",

Decapping and decay occurs both in and outside P-bodies. The order of association of factors with mRNPs in PBs is arbitrary.
