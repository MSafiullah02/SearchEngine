On March 16 th a group of about 30 researchers from the London Imperial College published a blunt paper [2] considering the various options of several different public policies measures that should be taken. They have analyzed several possibilities varying from total no intervention to complete lockdown of the whole population and they have estimated the number of lives loss in each case. Lately, because of the seriousness of the situation, there has been many other papers researching the same topic : Li Q. et. al. [3] , Wu P. et. al.[12] , Wu J. et. al.[13] , just to mention a few. Among the conclusions drawn from these papers it was clear that no easy choice was available for the governments, and that the main question to be answered was \" What is the optimum equilibrium between saving lives and minimizing the loss to the economy ?\"",

Given the continental size of Brazil and the ongoing local policy of quarantine it seems reasonable to face the problem locally. At the present moment most of the Brazilian cities, specially the large ones, are fairly well isolated from the others so that a local approach is justified. We particularly study the case of S\u00e3o Paulo city because it was the Brazilian city where the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed, it has been under quarantine practically since the beginning of the onset, it presents relatively reliable data on the epidemic and it is the largest and most important city in Brazil.",

We study the situation of the total number of ICU beds in S\u00e3o Paulo and then use the results the quarantine in Wuhan has produced in the decreasing number of cases of infected individuals, to infer similar results to S\u00e3o Paulo considering several levels of strictness of its quarantine model. We conclude estimating the time period necessary to decrease the number of infected individuals in order to avoid overwhelming the ICU system of the hospitals network in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the mathematical model we shall use: the logistic model. In order to justify the choice of such a model, in Section 3, we fit the data from Wuhan to it to show that is has an awesome level of accuracy. In Section 4 we use the data of Wuhan to estimate quantitatively how the strictness of the quarantine regime influences on the decreasing of the parameter r. In Section 5 we fit the logistic model to the data of S\u00e3o Paulo and finally in Section 6 we estimate when the total demand for ICU beds reaches 80% of the total number of such beds available and how long it can take to reduce these numbers based on the level of accession of the quarantine regime in the city. In Section 7 we summarize the results and present suggestions of public policies to increase the rate of reduction of the number of new infected cases. The data and theorem used in this study are presented in Section 8.",

Here this idea seems to be very reasonable, for the spread of the total number of infected individuals of COVID-19 is exponentially quick as we see it in the early days, but it is reasonable to believe it will slow down as the number of exposed susceptible individual, not yet infected, decrease.

The population of S\u00e3o Paulo city is around 12 million people which puts it into a very nice position to be compared to Wuhan (11.08 million inhabitants). Besides, it is big enough in several senses to be compared to several countries in Europe. The demographic density of S\u00e3o Paulo though is 7, 398.26 inhabitants/km 2 (according to IBGE's census [9]) about 5.6 times that of Wuhan.",
