Cardiac injury, defined as an elevated high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-TNI), has been reported during COVID-19; it is associated with an increased risk of mortality (1). Several underlying mechanisms are possible: COV-2 myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome type 1 associated with plaque rupture (systemic proinflammatory stimulation and hypercoagulability) or type 2 (mainly related to oxygen mismatch) (2). All these etiologies require a specific diagnosis and appropriate management. Coronary artery dissection may be related to intraplaque haemorrhage resulting in an intra-adventitial haematoma, spreading longitudinally along the coronary artery dissecting the viral infections can trigger acute coronary syndrome primarily owing to a combination of a significant systemic inflammatory response plus localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque level (4). Herein, we report the first case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a patient with COVID-19 infection. In this pandemic period, almost all the physicians' attention is captured by the symptoms of COVID-19. This report shows that true acute coronary syndrome can occur in this setting that should be appropriately characterized.",

            "text": "55 year-old man with a past medical history of peripheral artery disease was admitted to our hospital for cough and febrile dyspnea with suspected COVID-19. The PCR was positive, and the CT-scan demonstrated bilateral crazy paving. 48 hours after admission, he complained of chest pain. 12-lead ECG demonstrated inverted T waves in inferior leads. Hs-TNI was at 355 ng/L then 570 ng/L three hours later (N< 17 ng/L). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction at 60% without wall motion abnormalities, no diastolic dysfunction and a mild mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiogram performed via radial approach demonstrated a chronic total occlusion of the posterior descending artery with epicardial collateral from the left anterior descending artery (Rentrop 3, panel A). In the mid right coronary artery, a spontaneous dissecting coronary hematoma was observed with an intimal tear (panels B and C). Flow grade was Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 in the posterolateral artery. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in the right coronary artery and confirmed the spontaneous dissecting coronary hematoma with an intimal rupture (panels D, E and F). A conservative management was decided. Patient was transferred in medical department with a treatment by aspirin, statins and beta-blockers. A subsequent control of coronary angiogram is planned.",
