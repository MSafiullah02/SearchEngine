To stop the spread of COVID-19 from the early epicenter-Wuhan, China unprecedentedly locked down the entire city of Wuhan on January 23. It was shown that the Wuhan lockdown delayed the occurrence of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days and may have prevented more than 700,000 COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan [8]. This massive lockdown was then later served as a model for several other countries battling COVID-19 around the world. Currently the development of vaccines is still in progress and there are no effective antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19 infections. The only practical therapeutic option is hospitalization and intensive care unit management. Thus predicting the peak time (or turning point), the duration and the final size of the outbreak for each country becomes crucial for policy makers and public health authorities to have informed decisions on appropriate interventions and resource allocations. However, since the COVID-19 virus is a novel coronavirus, key infection parameters such as the mean incubation period and the mean infection period are not known. This, together with the complex contact patterns, makes predictions based on previously established compartmental models for other viruses very challenging.",

Let Yt be the daily new cases at day t since the first case was reported on day 1. Our model takes the following form(2.1)Yt\u223cPoisson(\u03bct),where \u03bct is the expectation of Yt with segmented expressions given below.\u03bct={\u03b11t\u03b21e\u2212\u03b31tfort=1,\u2026,s,\u03b12t\u03b22e\u2212\u03b32tfort=s+1,\u2026,T,where \u03b1k, \u03b2k and \u03b3k are regression parameters and k=1,2 correspond to periods before and after the day of major government actions (stay-at-home advises/orders, lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing) against COVID-19 at day s. The advantage of our segmented Poisson model is that the observed daily new cases before and after the day of major government actions are characterized integrally under a single model, but with separate mean curves. Unlike the widely used log-transformed linear model, our Poisson modeling approach enables us to deal with daily new cases as a count response with many zeros. In addition, our segmented Poisson model allows us to account for governments\u2019 interventions at different stages dynamically by incorporating stage specific segments.",

If those interventions were lifted or removed earlier cautiously based on scientific evidences, we would not expect any dramatic differences. On the other hand, if those interventions were lifted or removed earlier hastily without scientific support, our prediction would provide a reference to assess consequences of such irresponsible decisions.",
