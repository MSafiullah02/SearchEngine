            "text": "The pig is an omnivorous, monogastric species with many advantages to serve as an animal model for human diseases. There are very high similarities to humans in anatomy and functions of the immune system, e g., the presence of tonsils, which are absent in rodents. The porcine immune system resembles man for more than 80% of analyzed parameters in contrast to the mouse with only about 10%. The pig can easily be bred, and there are less emotional problems to use them as experimental animals than dogs or monkeys. Indwelling cannulas in a vein or lymphatic vessel enable repetitive stress-free sampling. Meanwhile, there are many markers available to characterize immune cells. Lymphoid organs, their function, and their role in lymphocyte kinetics (proliferation and migration) are reviewed. For long-term experiments, minipigs (e.g., G\u00f6ttingen minipig) are available. Pigs can be kept under gnotobiotic (germfree) conditions for some time after birth to study the effects of microbiota. The effects of probiotics can be tested on the gut immune system. The lung has been used for extracorporeal preservation and immune engineering. After genetic modifications are established, the pig is the best animal model for future xenotransplantation to reduce the problem of organ shortage for organ transplantation. Autotransplantation of particles of lymphnodes regenerates in the subcutaneous tissue. This is a model to treat secondary lymphedema patients. There are pigs with cystic fibrosis and severe combined immune deficiency available. Dedicated to three colleagues: Fritz Trepel (University of Ulm/Germany) with whom I performed the first experiments on perfusion the pig spleen, Richard M. Binns (Babraham Institute of animal physiology Babraham, Cambride, England) for stimulating experiments during several periods of experiments on pigs in Hannover and Babraham and Hermann-Josef Rothk\u00f6tter (now in Magdeburg, Germany) for all the experiments on G\u00f6ttingen minipigs with the focus on gut immunology.",

            "text": "The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) is a world-wide domestic animal. For biomedical research, pigs have been bred to get pigs of smaller size (minipig). There are many different minipigs, e.g., Minnesota, Yukatan, Hanford, Mini-Lewe, and the widely used G\u00f6ttingen minipigs (Glodeck et al. 1977; Bollen and Ellegaard 1996) . The genetic management of the G\u00f6ttingen minipig has been documented by Simianer and K\u00f6hn (2010) . A minor disadvantage in comparison with normal piglets is the smaller ears in the G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, which make it more difficult to take blood samples or intravenous (iv) injection via the ear vein. A great advantage of the pig as an experimental animal is that it can be kept under gnotobiotic /germfree conditions for some weeks after birth (Waldmann 1988) . Such gnotobiotic pigs are an excellent model to study the dramatic kidney problems (hemolytic uremic syndrome) after oral infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (Gunzer et al. 2002) .",

Examples from these books are reviews on the migration and homing of lymphocytes in the pig and the productions of lymphocyte in different lymphoid organs in pigs and the behavior of lymphocytes in vivo ). In 2009, there was a special issue on porcine immunology in the journal of developmental and comparative immunology. In the introductory article, Summerfield documented the continuous increase of annual publications on porcine immunology reaching more than 450 in 2008 ). In the most detailed book on immunology, the encyclopedia immunology, Saalm\u00fcller and Gerner (2016) wrote a chapter on the immune system of swine with enormous numbers of references. The reader is recommended to check that review for many details. The pig is an excellent model for developmental immunology .

            "text": "The complexity of cellular immune reaction can be characterized by the cluster of differentiation (CD) of different immune cell. Initially the mouse and man leukocytes were studied. CD workshops were organized to find a common nomenclature. For the pig, the first workshop was organized in 1991. In man, 419 proteins have been defined, and for the pig, 259 corresponding CD are characterized. The reader is referred to the review (Dawson and Lunney 2018) . See also the review of Piroiou-Guzylack and Salmon 2008. Porcine T cells can be subdivided into several different subsets very (NC) similar to other species, e.g., alpha, beta T cells (Gerner et al. 2015) . There are also natural killer cells that can respond to various cytokines and can lyse virus-infected cells (summarized by Gerner et al. 2009 ). NC cells are present in increased numbers in the lung of influenza-infected pigs (Mair et al. 2016 ). An interesting marker for pig lymphocytes is CD 27. CD 27+ lymphocytes are mature T cells in the thymus, and blood B lymphocytes lacked CD 27 expression and NK cells expressed it at intermediate level (Reutner et al. 2012) . A more recent study (Reutner et al. 2013 ) documented the differences of certain subsets in organ distribution and functions. The subset CDP alpha+ CD 27\u2212 cells resemble terminally differentiated effects or memory cells in man. In CD 8 alpha+ CD27+ helper cells homing receptors were increased. These data can be the basis for functional, such as migration kinetic studies which are not possible in man. However, there are also species' differences. As an example, interleukin 4 is not a stimulatory factor for B cells but is a blocked antibody and L-6 secretion and suppressed antigen-stimulated proliferation of B cells (Murtaugh et al. 2009 ). Therefore the pigs should not be used as a model for IL4 research.",

In the blood, the most easily accessible compartment was only 3 % (Pabst and Trepel 1975a, b) .

Also, specific antibody responses could be detected 7 days after immunization in 55-day-old fetuses (Tlaskalova-Hogenova et al. 1994) . This group (Sterzl et al.) in Prague was very active in germfree techniques in the pig. Therefore, the newborn piglet depends on suckling colostrum.

Best known are the alpha, beta defensins. A comparison of the different host defense peptides in the pig with those in man has been summarized by . These peptides have party also in antiviral activities as documented for the porcine reproductive and respirator syndrome virus. There was an upregulation of genes of different host defense peptides in 2week-old congenitally infected pigs ). A mycotoxin is often found in cereals and pig feed. The expression of porcine beta defensin was depressed. The intestinal permeability increased and the weight gain decreased (Wang et al. 2018) . Thus, antimicrobial peptides are critical in the pig epithelial barrier. Pathogen mentoring is critical in inflammation and infection. The most studied pattern recognition receptors (TLR) are Toll-like receptors, which are essential in activation of the immune system. In humans, 10 TLR genes have fully been identified and cloned in the pig. These are important in vaccine development (Uenishi and Shinhai 2009) . Rogers et al. (2008c) have published a table of 16 peptides, which are unique to pigs or have a human orthologue.

            "text": "As in other mammals, the epithelial cells of the thymus of the pig are derived from the pharyngeal endoderm and ectoderm from the third brachial cleft. Stem cells from the bone marrow enter this epithelial structure to form the two compartments: cortex and medulla. The role of the cortex is responsible for T lymphocyte proliferation and selection. During the development, the thymus anlage moves downward to the thorax and is finally placed in the retrosternal area. In the pig, there are also two cervical parts of the thymus on both sides of the trachea, which are easily accessible without an opening of the thorax. The thymus is extremely stress dependent, thus resulting in reduction of lymphocyte number and partly in a different subset composition. Therefore, we did not use local injections of DNA precursors to study lymphocyte production but applied the metaphase arrest technique using vincristine. Vincristine was injected intravenously ( 0.25 mg/kg body weight) after a control sample was excised and 4 (1, 2, 2.5, 3.5 h) biopsies are taken. On histological sections, the number of mitotic figures was counted in the medulla and the cortex of the thymus. The increase of the mitotic index with time was higher in the cortex (rm = 0.49%) than in the medulla (rm = 0.32%). An obvious drawback of this technique is that no subsets of lymphocytes can be determined (Pabst and Fritz 1986) . In other experiments in pigs, secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches) or bone marrow were labelled selectively with the DNA precursor tritiated thymidine and evaluation with autoradiography of thymic sections revealed an influx of newly formed lymphocyte from all these organs. The immigrants were always near to venules in the corticomedullary area. These venules had an unusual high endothelium similar to high endothelial venules in lymph nodes or tonsils. Such venules are documented in the recently published review (Pabst 2019) . In the pig, the emigration of lymphocyte via the thymic vein was characterized and quantified ). There were differences in lymphocyte subsets when peripheral blood, thymus, or thymic emigrants were characterized. The group of Bianchi et al. (1992) studied the development of B and T cell compartments in porcine lymphoid organs from birth to adult life. Mesenteric lymph nodes of pigs were selectively labbeled with the DNA precursor tritiated thymidene. Thus, the local proliferation and the export of nearly-formed lymphoid cells to lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs were quantified by autroradiography (Pabst and Trepel 1979) . One interesting finding was the presence of few immunoglobulin-positive B lymphocytes already before birth with an increase until group adult life. Recently Sinkorova et al. 2019 , documented that in the pig, B cell lymphogenesis in the thymus is similar to that in the bone marrow in respect to the rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (Sinkora et al. 2019). The presence of a relatively high incidence of IgA-positive cells in the pig thymus had already been described before (Allan and Porter 1973) . In the young pig, there is a virus with severely effects on the respiratory and reproductive system: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). This virus infects thymic antigen presenting cells in the thymus and interacts with the double position T cells resulting in a loss of T helper cells . To my knowledge only in pigs vascularized thymic lobe transplantation has been successfully established to support thymopoiesis (La Mattina et al. 2002) . When xenotransplantation of pig organs will be established (see paragraph on xenotransplantation), this might be a clinically interesting topic.",

For the details on the development of the tonsils in the pig, see Liebler-Tenorio and Pabst 2006. All these tonsils are also found in the pig in contrast to the mouse and rat, which lack tonsils. Thus, the pig is an excellent model to study their structure and function. A further advantage is the accessibility of the palatine tonsils. Lymphocyte proliferation in the different compartments, this tonsil has been studied by the metaphase and arrest technique using vincristine. After a biopsy was taken in anesthetized pigs, vincristine was injected with iv resulting in an arrest of cells in the cell cycle in the metaphase and four biopsies were excised for up to 3.5 h, the mitotic rate (%/h) was highest in the follicle (3.4) but lower in the interfollicular region (0.2) and the corona (0.2) and in the reticular epithelium of the crypts (0.3) (Pabst and Fritz 1986) . After multiple local injections of fluorescein isothiocyanate into the palatine tonsils in young pigs, the emigration of lymphocyte to other organs like different lymph nodes spleen and gut wall was quantified (Pabst and Nowara 1984) . The palatine tonsil in the pig is ideal to study antigen uptake and vaccination protocols due to its acceptability.

The pig is an important model for this treatment. The group of Birchall in England focused on this topic. The first step was to describe the vascular, myological situation, and functional outcomes (Birchall et al. 2011; Birchall et al. 2017) . The immunological outcomes with the lymphocyte subset composition in the supraglottic, glottic, and infraglottic region have been characterized in minipigs (Birchall et al. 2011) .

There are T and B lymphocytes (for details and early references, see Binns 1982) . The efferent lymph coming from a lymph node in the pig contains very few lymphocytes in comparison with other species (see paragraph on lymphocyte migration via HEV). In the pig, the medullary tissue is in the periphery of the lymph node and the cortical part in the central area. Thus, T and B cells are mainly found in an atypical localization. Each compartment can be stimulated, e.g., by injecting an antigen in the draining area, and \"lymphocyte depletion, e. g., by giving anti-lymphocyte serum or whole body irradiation results in a reduction of lymphocytes\" in the lymph nodes (for details see Binns 1982) . The cortex, paracortex, and medulla are distinct microanatomical structure. The cortex contains primary follicles and germinal centers surrounded by a corona. These are called secondary follicles which are surrounded by a sinus similar to the subcapsular sinus in other species. Neonatal germfree piglets do not have germinal centers. The paracortex or sometimes called deep diffuse cortex contains tightly packed small lymphocytes. This compartment can easily be identified by venules with a high endothelium (High endothelial venules=HEV). See also paragraph on lymphocyte migration. The medulla is formed by a reticulum which a sparse distribution of lymphocytes and plasma cells (Binns 1982) . A comparison of the structure of lymph nodes in different species has been summarized by Rothk\u00f6tter 2009 and Haley 2017 . A further positive aspect of pig lymph nodes is that one lymph node drains to the next one, e.g., superficial inguinal to deep inguinal, and this is similar to the structure in man but not typical in the mouse. Hoshi et al. (1986) documented large central cisternae and intratrabecular lymph channels with lymphatic valves in pig lymph nodes. These are very unique findings not known from the lymph nodes in other species. The development of the B and T lymphocyte compartments from birth to adult was studied by Bianchi et al. (1992) .",

In sheep, the endothelial cells of the postcapillary vein are flat. However, there is also a high rate of lymphocyte emigration. Thus, the height of the endothelial cells cannot be the essential criteria. After leaving the blood via HEV, lymphocytes migrate into efferent lymphatics, lymphatic trunks, and finally the thoracic duct, which ends at the left jugular-subclavian angle. This route is called lymphocyte recirculation. In pigs, a paucity of lymphocytes in the thoracic duct lymph had been described about 60 years ago (for details, see Binns et al. 1985) . Bennell and Husband (1981a, b) documented that in pigs, lymphocytes from the afferent gut lymphatics do not migrate from the lymph node by efferent lymphatics ramified over the endothelial junctions, and lymphocytes were identified in different phases of migration between endothelial cells and intercellular junctions. In such a study, the migration of the lymphocytes into or out of the vessel human cannot be decided (Sasaki et al. 1994 ). The following in vivo experiments documented the exit of lymphocytes from lymph nodes. Mesenteric lymph nodes (after the gut was tied off) were perfused via the artery with a normothermic cell-free perfusate; the venous effluent was collected for up to 3 h. The mesenteric lymph was collected in parallel. In pigs, lymphocytes left lymph nodes continuously although no lymphocyte could have entered the lymph node. In sheep on the other hand, lymphocytes left via the efferent lymphatics and not the blood. After 3 h of cell-free perfusion, there were still lymphocytes in the wall of HEV in pigs (Binns et al. 1985) . Already in 1990, Binns and Licence have published the route of pig peripheral blood lymphocytes in fetal sheep lymph nodes and sheep blood lymphocytes in unsuckled newborn piglet lymph node. The xenogenic lymphocytes emigrated as the homologous lymphocytes. Thus, there must be an exit signal in pig lymph nodes. An open question remains: do the HEV work as a revolving donor that is an entry and exit site or are there HEV for entry and stress for exit? (Fig. 2) .",

On the one hand, there is the \"storage spleen\" with many muscles in trabeculae and the capsule, e.g., in the dog. That can result in a rapid contraction and mobilization of up to 20% of erythrocytes into the blood. On the other hand, there is the spleen which consists of large amounts of immune cells (\"protection spleen\"). The pig spleen is similar to the human spleen. To test the role of an organ in any function is to remove it and look for the effects. Autologous blood lymphocytes were labelled and reinjected via an iv cannula. Then a splenectomy performed and the retransfusion experiments repeated. The residence time of the lymphocytes in the blood was prolonged by the dramatically of after splenectomy (Pabst and Trepel 1976) . The data obtained in normal pigs were the base for the statement that more lymphocytes recirculate through the spleen than through all other lymphoid organs with high endothelial venules (Pabst and Westermann 1998) . The pigs' spleen had been selectively labelled with the DNA precursor 3H-thymidin. In serial samples of splenic tissue, the cell cycle parameters G2-S-G1-M phase were determined by autoradiography. Thus, the proliferation in the normal microenvironment was characterized in contrast to many in vitro techniques (Pabst and Trepel 1975a, b) . These data obtained in pigs was the base for the perfusion of isolated human spleens, and the cell cycle length, G2 and S phase, could be determined (Pabst and Reinecke 1981) and documenting the production of the coagulation factor VIII by the spleen (Pabst et al. 1977a ). All nucleated cells in the spleen were labelled by selective perfusion of the pig spleen with an RNA precursor (H3-cytidine) and the emigrated lymphocytes identified in other organs and quantified (Pabst et al. 1978) . The lymphocyte production and the emigration of the newly formed lymphocytes were studied by using the DNA precursor tritiated thymidine (Pabst et al. 1977a, b) .

In a spleen person or after a splenectomy due to splenic rupture or hematologic reasons, pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended. When there is trauma to the spleen, a partial splenectomy can be an alternative. When splenic fragments are transplanted, they will regenerate and function as a spleen.

The blood pool is the most easy accessible pool. At any given time, only about 2% of all lymphocytes of the body are in the blood. To study the role of an individual organ in lymphocyte migration, a general cell marker like the RNA precursor tritiated cytidine or fluorescein isotiocyanate for all cells has been used. For proliferating lymphocyte, radioactively labelled tritiated thymidine has been usefull. The evaluation was performed by scintillation counting or autoradiography. The size of the vessels in the young pig is large enough to be cannulated and connected to an extracorporeal perfusion system. Thus, labelling lymphocytes in their normal environment at body temperature is possible in the pig. By this technique, the spleen, the bone marrow, and the small intestine with or without mesenteric lymph nodes were studied (Pabst et al. 1980 ). The interaction between innate immunity and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome was studied (Sanger et al. 2011) The selectivity of the label was documented. The number and localization of lymphocytes labelled in one organ could be quantified of different times and the life span measured (e.g., lymphoid cells labelled in the pig spleen emigrated in large numbers to the bone marrow and developed into mature plasma cells (Pabst and Nowara 1982) ). This technique is advantageous to many local injections of the label as the perfusion is more homogenous. This technique is not applicate in rodents, and therefore normally lymphoid organs were teased to cell suspensive, labelled in vivo, and reinjected into recipients.",

Therefore, we recommend the term i MALT: Integrated mucosal lymphoid tissue (Pabst and Brandtzaeg 2020) , because there is preferential migration of lymphoid cells, e.g., from the gut wall to the bronchial tract. An example is to protect pigs from the bacterial lung infection by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by giving an oral dose of encapsulated bacteria (Hensel et al. 1994; Hensel et al. 1996) .

            "text": "There were some differences in MALT structure and functions in farm animals (Liebler-Tenorio and Pabst 2006) . The pig as a monogastric omnivorous species has several similarities to man (Bailey et al. 2005a, b) . In the gut wall, there are organized accumulations of lymphocytes: isolated follicles and aggregated follicles called Peyer's patches (PP), which differ in cell composition and overall structure between \"conventional\" PP, e.g., in the jejunum (jej PP) and upper ileum (jej PP) and a continuous patch in the distal ileum (il PP). In the mouse, there are also the so-called crypto-patches and in the rat and man lymphocyte filled villi (Pabst and Brandtzaeg 2020) . The development of the number, size, structure, and proliferative capacity of PP in the jejunum and ileum was studied at different postnatal ages in conventional and germfree pigs . The length of the jej PP and ileal PP increased with age. This was due to an increase in follicle size and the number of follicles. In older pigs (4, 5 years), the ileal PP regressed to small follicles. In germfree pigs of 39 and 59 days of age, longer PP were found than in newborns but significantly shorter than in conventional pigs. The lymphocyte production was studied by the metaphase arrest technique using vincristine. Lymphocyte proliferation increase dramatically in germinal centers with age, while in the interfollicular area and dome, an age-independent lymphocyte production was documented with no differences between jej PP and il PP ). In another study, the PP in pigs were studied in 1-, 1.5-, and 2-month-old pigs. The interfollicular area was wider (0.1 \u00b1 0.04 mm) in jej PP in comparison with ileal PP (0.04 \u00b1 0.03 mm). In the jej PP, there were more T cells than in il PP. In germfree pigs, there was a preference of IgM + cells over IgA + (Barman et al. 1997) . A potential effect of resecting the il PP or transposing it to the oral part of the small intestine in the pig. There was no compensatory growth after resection. However, the number of CD 8 lymphocytes was reduced in the blood, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes . The dome epithelium is covered not only by enterocytes but also by membranous cells (M cell) which are the preferential cells for the uptake of particulate antigens. In the pig, the marker for M cells is cytokeratin 18 (Gebert et al. 1994) . Fluorescent yeast particles were placed in the gut lumen and the uptake by M cells in jeg PP studied. Electron microscopy documented the kinetic of uptake with very few particles in macrophages in the epithelium, but after 4 h, the yeast was below the basal lamina and 89% in macrophages (Beier and Gebert 1998) .",

Based on this observation, we hypothesize that it would be a great advantage to develop a stimulus for the induction of M cell so that all PP are active for antigen uptake.

The site of absorption of immunoglobulins of colostrum in suckled pigs was obvious in the villous epithelium but absent from the crypts (Butler et al. 1981) . A single dose of antigen (ovalbumin) in neonatal pigs reduced the subsequent immune response (Haverson et al. 2009 ). Environmental factors increase the productions of IgA . The pig has also been used as a model for the development and compartmentalization of the TCR delta repertoir and the effect of age and microbial factors (Holtmeier et al. 2002) . The migration pattern of T and B lymphocytes from the gut lymph was quantified and characterized in pigs. Only IgA-positive cells accumulate in the lamina propria ). Bennell and Husband (1981a, b) described the experiments in rats and pigs resecting mesenteric lymph nodes and later cannulating the intestinal lymphatic trunk in pigs or the thoracic duct in rats. The technique enabled the sampling of lymph coming from the gut without the filter station of mesenteric lymph nodes. Thus, this was afferent lymph. In rats, the animals have to be strictly restraint in a Bollman cage. The animals cannot move, and it is extremely stressful. Therefore, this technique is not allowed since several years in Germany. In sheep, a restraining cage holds the animals in a standing position. Bennell and Husband (1981a, b) had not described whether the pigs were restrained.",

At 3 months of age, the G\u00f6ttingen minipigs were laparotomized and the mesenteric lymph nodes carefully removed from both sides of the mesentery and the blood supply of the lymph nodes stopped by electrocautery. After such an operation, the afferent and efferent lymphatics anastomose by physiological regeneration (called \"pseudoafferent lymphatic\"). At about 8 months of age, a venous cannula was placed in an external jugular vein. The cannula was pulled through a silastic tube and exteriorized in the neck. The intestinal lymph duct could easily be identified because the pigs were fed with olive oil the evening before the operation. The absorbed fat changed the color of the lymph to white. The intestinal lymph duct was below the pancreas near to the confluence of the left renal vein and the caudal vena cava (Rothk\u00f6tter et al. 1993) . The canula in the intestinal lymphatic was pulled through a silastic tube which avoided kinking and could be fixed to the skin, where a 250 ml bottle was placed in a bag. The lymph volume and the lymphocyte numbers and different cell subsets were measured. The pigs were placed in nonrestraining conditions with full access to food and water each in a separate box as the pigs otherwise started chewing on the cannula of the other pigs. In some pigs, the DNA precursor BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) was given iv to measure the proliferation of the cells in the gut. By double labelling, the subsets of BrdU positive cells could be determined: IgA + cells reached a maximum of > 50% of 12 k (Thielke et al. 1999) . In other experiments with cannulating intestinal lymphatics, the surprising data were obtained that in total numbers, more newly formed T cells and B cells left the gut wall via lymphatics (Rothk\u00f6tter et al. 1995) . B and T lymphocyte migrate from the gut lymph to other parts of the gut wall and all other lymphoid organs. However, only IgA + cells accumulate in the intestinal mucosa . Proliferating intestinal gamma/delta cells recirculated recently and formed mainly the pool of these cells in the blood (Thielke et al. 2003) . In conclusion, the pig is an excellent model to study intestinal lymph and the lymphoid cells coming from the gut wall under conditions not possible in other species.",

The monogastric omnivorous pig was therefore tested. When Enterococcus faecium was added to the food, the subsets of CD4 + and CD25 + cells in the ileal Peyer\u00b4s patches were tested. There were some changes in the T helper cell responses but not convincing effects after Salmonella typhimurium infection . A probiotic Bacillus cerens stain activated the Natural killer receptor (NUG2D) resulting in differences in the subset composition of intraepithelial cells (Altmeyer et al. 2014) . In another study, the prebiotic feeding of Enterococcus faecium resulted in a longer and wider villi and higher numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. This effect is only present at day 28 postinfection (Rieger et al. 2015) . In pre-weaning piglets, the probiotic affected intestinal immune-associated gene expression (Siepert et al. 2014) . In 2011, there was an outbreak of infections with an E. coli bacterium producing Shiga toxin resulting in diarrhea and a hemolytic syndrome (HUS) in humans. Neonatal gnotobiotic pigs were used as an animal model for this strain. Unexpectedly, this strain caused only mild symptoms and minor changes in histology and blood parameter. Thus, in this case, the pig did not show symptoms as in man (W\u00f6chtl et al. 2017) . The effects of dietary factors on gut homeostasis and early gut maturation have been reviewed by Everaert et al. 2017 and Roselli et al. 2017 .",

The dynamics of lymphocyte in the lung had been summarized already 10 years earlier (Pabst 1990 ). In the pig, the composition of lymphocytes in the bronchial epithelium and lamina propria is not different to other species. BALT is hardly present in healthy pigs but very obvious in mycoplasma infected animals. The intravascular pool is of much more interest. When lymphocytes are labelled and injected intravenously, the majority will be found in the lung initially. This is often interpreted as a sticking of the lymphocytes to the intrapulmonary capillary bed. This is not the case as documented in pigs. Blood lymphocytes were labelled in vitro with a fluorescent dye and injected either intravenously or into the left heart. Comparable numbers were of lymphocytes found in the lung after 30 min indicating a specific homing of lymphocytes to the lung vascular bed. When the left lung of the pig was perfused with a cell-free medium for up to 4 h, a continuous venous release of lymphocytes was measured. This resulted in 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 lymphocytes. Also labelling peripheral blood lymphocytes with 51 Cr documented a high intravascular pool of lymphocytes . The bronchoalveolar space is often lavage in the clinics, and the numbers and subsets of lymphocytes are taken as an indicator for different lung diseases. The majority of cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage are macrophages. The question was often, what is the origin and fate of the lymphocytes in the airspace. Therefore, autologous blood lymphocytes of normal young pigs were labelled with 51 Cr or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and i n s t i l l e d i n t o a s i n g l e s e g m e n t a l b r o n c h u s . B y immunohistology, FITC-positive lymphocytes were found in the sinuses of the draining nodes. Combined with cell surface staining (B, T, T H , and Ts lymphocytes), the lymphocyte subsets were quantified and showed a preferential migration out of the bronchoalveolar space to the draining bronchial lymph node (Pabst and Binns 1995) . The lymphatic drainage of the pig lung is very comparable to man (Riquet et al. 2000) .In the pig lung, there are also intravascular macrophages which had for longtime believed is only the case in goats (Winkler 1988 ). These macrophages pick up and clear bacteria and particulates from the blood.",

Lungs of organ donors have to be prepared often for transport to the recipient. Roman et al. (2015) compared a cell-free or cellular perfused in a pig model. Lung histology and ultrastructure were largely preserved (Becker et al. 2015) . Cellular and acellular perfusate and its effect on the ultrastructure of the lung were studied in 20 pigs (Steinmeyer et al. 2018) . In vivo treatment of the isolated perfused lung was tested in minipigs by autoretransplantation (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2016) . Another application of the isolated perfused lung is to treat infected lungs by perfusion with high doses of antibiotics followed by autotransplantation (Zinne et al. 2018) . The pig lung has also been used for silencing MHC expression by applying short-hairpin RNAs targeting \u00df2-microglobulin and class II transactivator transcripts. The feasibility of this technique was demonstrated achieving a targeted silencing effect of 67% and 52%, respectively, without effecting cell viability or lung tissue integrity (Figueiredo et al. 2019) . A functional repair of the donor lungs was tested by IL-10 gene therapy (Cypel et al. 2009 ). Negative pressure ventilation in normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion was tested with pig lungs. Irrespective of the perfusate, the solution there was less inflammation and less lung injury (Aboelnazar et al. 2018) . The safety and efficacy of ex vivo donor lung adenoviral IL-10 gene therapy for a transplant survival model has also been tested successfully in pigs (Machuca et al. 2017) . Meanwhile normothermic perfusion of the lung is possible also in man (Warnecke et al. 2012; Fildes et al. 2015) .",

Symptomatic treatments from birth have extended the life expectancy over the last decades. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease in man caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulation (CFTR) ion channel. CFTR is expressed in epithelia of many organs especially the lung, pancreas, liver, intestine and vas deferens. A sweat test with pilocarpine is a strong indicator for this devastating disease. The mouse models do not show lung disease. Therefore, it was a great breakthrough when the group of Rogers published the pig model in 2008 (Rogers et al. 2008a; and summarized by Rogers et al. 2008c . All these data document the advantage of the pig model of this disease. The very relevant function of bacterial eradication from the lung was described by Stoltz et al. (2010) . There are more than 2000 mutations known of the CFTR gene. One of the most frequent mutations is the \u0394F508 mutation. Therefore, a further advantage was to develop pigs with a mutation of \u0394F508 (Ostedgaard et al. 2011) . Thus, the pig is now the animal model for future experiments to treat this disease.",

Already in 1985, Hammer et al. produced transgenic pigs by microinjection. The pig is the favorite species in xenotransplantation: The major histocompatibility complex in pigs is well characterized (Lunney et al. 2009 ). Genome editing has revolutionized genetically modified pigs (Klymiuk et al. 2010; Yao et al. 2016; Fischer et al. 2016; Fischer et al. 2019) . The different techniques and also in combination have resulted in more than 40 different genetic alterations (Cooper et al. 2016) . Some examples are interleukin-2 receptor gamma gene knockout pigs by zinc finger nucleaseencoding in RNA (Watanabe et al. 2013) or the development of inducible transgene expressions in pigs (Klymiuk et al. 2012 ). There are examples for genetic modifications with relevance to xenogeneic organ transplantation. The production of transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation has been summarized . For the detail on gene stacking and gene editing in pigs, see the paper of Fischer et al. 2016 . In the preclinical situation, pig to primate transplantation is the first step, which has been explored for pancreatic islet transplantation (Matsunari et al. 2014; Hering and Walawalkar 2009) , kidney transplantation (Iwase and Kobayashi 2015) and heart transplantation (Mohiuddin et al. 2015; L\u00e4ngin et al. 2018) . In particular, the study of L\u00e4ngin et al. is impressive because the pig hearts had life supporting functions for up to 945 days than in the monkeys. The pigs were genetically multi-modified: they lacked the galactose alpha-1,3 galactose epitopes and expressed the human membrane cofactor protein (CD46) and human thrombomodulin (L\u00e4ngin et al. 2018) . Initially there was the trend of transforming viruses from pigs to man when xenotransplantation of pig organs and immunosuppression will be needed after transplanting an organ normally called prevention for porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). So far, no such phenomenon has been documented in pig to baboon transplantation.",

After, some differences to human skin are discussed (Monteiro-Riviere and Riviere 1996). The histological structure of the pig skin has been studied in detail by Meyer et al. (2007) . They stress in particular the comparable microvascular structure. The thickness of the different layers varies between body areas as in man. The outer side of the ear is recommended for drug testing. They state to store the pig ear at 4\u00b0C for 4-6 h after obtaining the material from the slaughterhouse and thus avoiding the use of experimental animals. The isolated blood perfused ear of the pig has been recommended for skin penetration studies (de Lange et al. 1992) . Skin abrasion as a technique to treat sulfur mustard injuries had been tested in Yucatan minipigs (Rice et al. 2000) . The immunology of the pig skin as a model for human skin has been summarized by (Summerfield et al. 2015) . Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been studied in the young pigs by the local injection of phytohemagglutinin. There was an accumulation of CD 8 + lymphocytes. All lymphocytes subsets showed a high rate of proliferation locally as documented by the incorporation of the DNA-precursor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Fritz et al. 1990 ).",

When indwelling cannulas, e.g., venous, biliary, intestinal, or lymphatic are needed, each animal has to be placed individually. The handling of the pig, e.g., for injections needs careful training to avoid stress effects. The placenta is tight and therefore large molecules as antibodies cannot pass the barrier to the fetus. The unique structure of the lymph node is a limitation for the studies on the functional microanatomy of the lymph node.",

The pig can be kept in a germfree, gnotobiotic environment for several weeks. The skin is very similar to the human skin. There are tonsils in the pig in contrast to rodents. The intestine, pancreatic and bile ducts, vessels (artery, vein, lymphatics), and ureter can be cannulated for some time to collect samples without stress. Pigs breed at all times of the year and have a large litter size. For longtime experiments, well-characterized minipigs (e.g., G\u00f6ttingen minipig) are available all over the world. There are less ethical problems to use pig organs for transplantation than of pet animals (like the dog or large primates like chimpanzee, orangutan, or gorilla). The organ size is another advantage of the pig. The enormous recent progress in genetic engineering (\"Hominidae\") of the pig is the reason for the prognosis that the pig will be the organ donor of the future for xenotransplantation in man.",
