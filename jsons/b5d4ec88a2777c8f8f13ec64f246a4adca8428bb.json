Accordingly, only a part of the high rate is likely because of the known predisposition for polycystic kidney disease. 14 As death because of urinary disease increases with age, it can be assumed that it will be a common cause of death in these breeds also after 12 years of age.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 504, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Diagnosis"}, {"text": "Traumatic causes of death were primarily traffic accidents and falls from a height, and were most common in domestic cats, Norwegian Forest cats, and Maine Coons. This may be a reflection of the degree to which these breeds have access to the outdoors, and be opposite to the situation postulated for urinary deaths 10 (ie, indoor cats tend to get obese or develop disease because of lack of exercise but are less at risk for severe trauma). In 25% of Swedish breeding catteries, some or all of the cats had free access to outdoors. 15 Neoplastic disorders are the 3rd most common cause, with considerable variation among breeds. For the Maine Coon and Siamese groups, neoplastic disease, dominated by mammary tumors in the Siamese, was the most common cause of death, even though these are relatively young cats. Significant breed differences in cancer risk are described for dogs, and a genetic component exists for some cancers in dogs. Studies have shown that Siamese cats are at increased risk of developing mammary carcinoma, although the mechanism is unknown. 16 In the total population, infectious disease was the most common cause of death. This is probably because all cats must be vaccinated against feline panleukopenia before enrollment into life insurance. Domestic and Maine Coon cats had low MRs attributed to infections compared with several other breeds. Infections, dominated by FIP, were the most common cause of death in Birmans. FIP is a sporadic disease caused by mutation of an endemic virus (feline coronavirus, FCoV). 17 Inheritance of susceptibility to FIP previously has been described for Persians and Birmans, 17 and an overrepresentation of other breeds also has been described. 17 As cats would not be covered for death because of FIP occurring within a year after the start of insurance, and because FIP can be challenging to confirm, 17 the number of FIP cases may be even higher than shown here. Regardless, infections dominated by FIP were the most common diseases in Birmans up to 12 years of age. One contributing factor to the high incidence of infections in Birmans may be that a number of cats with ascites or hydrothorax because of restrictive cardiomyopathy are falsely diagnosed as having exudative FIP. Death because of cardiovascular reasons was the 3rd most common cause in Birmans, and these diagnoses can be difficult to differentiate without further clinical testing, such as echocardiography. 18 The most common specific diagnosis within the cardiovascular category was, not surprisingly, cardiomyopathy. However, feline cardiomyopathies are a heterogenous group of diagnoses. Depending on the morphologic appearance and pathophysiology, cardiomyopathy in cats is frequently classified as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic, and ''unclassified'' cardiomyopathy. 18, 19 The specific-feline cardiomyopathy often was not specified in the database, but based on the literature and clinical experience, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was the most likely diagnosis in most of the cases in most of the breeds. This disease is well documented in almost all of the breed groups in this study as a major contributor to cardiovas- cular disease. 19, 20 The present study could not show a difference in sex, which is in agreement with previous studies. 20 The domestic cat group stands out as having a lower cardiovascular ASMR than other breeds. This finding may not completely reflect the true incidence of cardiomyopathy in this population because domestic cat owners may not be as motivated as pure bred cat owners or breeders to establish an exact diagnosis or to treat chronic disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 535, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1069, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1546, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1642, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1712, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2446, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2829, "end": 2832, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2833, "end": 2835, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3203, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3206, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3306, "end": 3308, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis"}, {"text": "We have closely considered whether the interesting result on survival (ie, the increase over this 8-year period for cats o13 years of age) could have arisen as a consequence of insurance policies or been a function of the research method.

As regards statistics, given that the method is stratified on and uses the available information at each age span to calculate the statistics, if there were no cats or deaths in an interval (ie, ''young''), problems may arise at older ages, but this was not the case here.

Cause-specific mortality varied with age and breed. Urinary problems, trauma, neoplasia, infections, and cardiovascular problems were the 5 most common categories of causes of death. The fact that the overall survival increased with time period likely reflects both a willingness to keep pet cats longer and the increased level of veterinary care. The limitations of the diagnostic information have been discussed, but are reflective of veterinary practice and such issues are common in population-based research using secondary data. Given the scarcity of population-level information on cats, these limitations do not outweigh the usefulness of the data.
