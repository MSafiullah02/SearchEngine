A genetic mutation was identified in the PKD1 gene which was linked to AD-PKD. Two types of genetic tests are currently available (RFLP and real-time PCR).8, 9 The prevalence of the disease in other breeds is less known. It has been reported sporadically in Burmillas, domestic shorthairs, Himalayans, American Shorthairs, Scottish Folds, British Shorthairs and Ragdolls.1, 10, 11\n",

Cysts form from renal tubular cells and eventually separate from the nephron as they develop. As cysts enlarge, they compress surrounding normal renal parenchyma and lesions of chronic interstitial nephritis occur. As the disease advances, cysts increase in size, and renal volume increases. For these reasons, PKD is considered a progressive disease, and the prognosis is guarded.1, 12, 13\n",

From 1970 to 1977 the registries of British Blues and Chartreux cats were amalgamated, being again separated after 1977.16 This could be the potential route by which the AD-PKD gene was introduced to the breed.",
