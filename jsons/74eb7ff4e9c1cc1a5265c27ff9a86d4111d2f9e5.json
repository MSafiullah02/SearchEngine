            "text": "stem the virus spread have reduced the circumstances that usually predispose to trauma: 163 traffic accidents, sports injuries, accidental falls on the road, direct frontal blow. 2) The fear of a 164 possible infection in the hospital discouraged those who underwent mild trauma from going to our 165 emergency room. 3) The fear of incurring fines for violating government restrictions has further 166 discouraged patients with mild trauma. 4) A lot of elderly patients have been isolated, and they 167could not count on family assistance for transportation to the hospital. Therefore, even on this 168 occasion, patients with mild trauma hesitated to go to the Trauma Center. 169Shoulder contusions drastically reduced in the COVID period (60 no-COVID period cases vs 11 170 COVID period cases), however, their prevalence with respect to the total number of contusions 171 remained almost unchanged (14.7% vs 12.09%). This did not occur for elbow contusions that 172 decreased by 3.44%, compared to all contusions in the no-COVID time, to 1.09% in the COVID 173 time. Once again, the decrease is due to the reduction/absence of high energy trauma (traffic 174 accidents and sports injuries). 175Proximal humeral fractures are the seventh most frequent fractures in adults 21 . The prevalence 176 varies from 4% to 10% of all fractures according to several studies performed in different countries 177 and populations 2,4,9,14,18,21 . In the two studied periods, humeral head fractures were 6.57% (no-178The average age of these patients (72 yrs no-COVID period; 70yrs COVID period) and the 180 traumatic mechanism responsible for the fracture (accidental fall for all patients but one) explain 181 why the pandemic did not change the prevalence of this fracture. In fact, traumas, in both periods, 182 occurred in the home environment and acted on an osteoporotic bone. Data seems to be in line with 183 the Carbone et al7 results who observed that 72% of patients with humeral head fractures were 184 markedly osteoporotic and that most of these patients were elderly females sustaining low energy 185 trauma. 186 Postacchini et al 20 in an epidemiological study observed that clavicle fractures represent 2.6% of 187 all fractures and that traffic accidents, falls and sports injury were the most common causes 188 responsible for the fracture. During the COVID period, we have managed only 2 patients (0.96% of 189 all fractures). The most plausible explanation for this showy decrease in clavicle fractures is due to 190 the drastic decline in traffic accidents and to the absence of patients with fractures following sports 191 injuries. Similar considerations can be made to explain the absence of cases with a scapula/glenoid 192 fracture during the COVID period. In fact, in the no-COVID period, we had treated 3 male patients 193 aged between 40 and 50 years (no bony Bankart). Two of these patients sustained the fracture 194 following a traffic accident. These percentages are in line with Ideberg et al 10 series regarding the 195 prevalence of glenoid fracture in the general population. 196 Radial head fractures are the most common fractures around the elbow 5 . Kaas 12 observed that the 197 mean age of female patients (52.8 years) was significantly higher than that of male patients (40.5 198 years). Gender influences the mechanism of injury; female patients commonly sustaining their 199 fracture following a low energy fall 8 . Our patients with radial head fracture managed during the 200 COVID period differ from those of no-COVID period in size (decreased), gender prevalence 201 (females only), average age (drastically increased), and traumatic mechanism (accidental falls 202 only). Obviously, the absence of sports injuries and traffic accidents, which usually involve young 203 males, explains the epidemiological difference between the two examined periods. Similar 204 considerations can be made for distal humerus fractures and proximal ulna fractures. Patients included in the sprain/subluxation shoulder group are those who never had trauma. The joint hyperlaxity makes the prevalence of this pathological condition 209 independent of the restrictive measures imposed to limit COVID-19 viral spread. The only patient 210 we counted in the elbow sprain/subluxation group had no associated fractures, nor had clinical signs 211 of joint instability. The diagnosis was formulated on the basis of what the patient said (he told 212 having the feeling of momentary post-traumatic elbow instability). No conclusions can be advanced 213 from a single patient. 214Shoulder instability is a common orthopedic condition, especially in a young active 215 population 13,15,17 . In our Trauma Center, primary dislocations and recurrences were 58% of all 216 dislocations managed in the no-COVID period and 53% of the COVID period. Compared to the no-217 COVID period, the patient number decreased because there were no dislocations following sports 218 injuries or traffic accidents. 219",
