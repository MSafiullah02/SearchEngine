In spite of eye-catching colorful visual appearance in the sky with the continuous sound of detonation of firecrackers, this short-term emission, results in large airborne gaseous as well as particle pollutants in the troposphere (Pongpiachan et al., 2017; Bencardino et al., 2018). This emission leads to serious environmental implications, which results in the deterioration of health quality and life expectancy. For instance, due to severe airborne pollution in China, the government has declared a ban on manufacturing, sales and bursting of firecrackers in some cities from 1993 to 2006 to overcome such situations (Han et al., 2007). In New Delhi worst atmospheric condition was observed during November 2017, because of sudden rise in particulate matters due to local as well as transported pollutants, which reduced the visibility to less than 50 m, and people faced health problems like coughing, eyes watering, difficulties in breathing and headaches. Apropos to the above government declared a health emergency in Delhi during November 2017 (Terry et al., 2018). Conticini et al. (2020) conducted a correlation-based study between the fatality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and the level of atmospheric pollution. They reported study site with high atmospheric pollution were having high fatality rate in the people suffering from SARS-CoV2 viral infection.",

Many researchers have reported that carbonaceous fractions of aerosols contribute more than other fractions of aerosols like inorganic and ionic components in troposphere (Tao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). Carbonaceous aerosols are of two types, i.e., elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). The EC are mainly emitted from the incomplete combustion of carbon containing substances, e.g., fossil fuel and biomass. Whereas, OCs are either emitted directly from re-suspension of soil containing degraded biomass, biomass burning, vehicular and coal-based industrial exhausts, etc., as primary sources or they can be formed as secondary pollutants or secondary organic aerosols from varieties of chemical reactions through photochemical oxidation of gaseous precursors such as volatile organic compounds (Turpin and Huntzicker, 1991; Richard et al., 2002; Koelmans et al., 2006; Bisht et al., 2015). It can be stated that OC may be consisted of primary organic carbon (POC) or it may be the product of heterogeneous chemical reactions as secondary organic carbon (SOC) during gas to particle conversion process.",

            "text": "India is one of the largest firecrackers producing country over world (Tian et al., 2014). For the Deepawali festival days in October or November, intense fireworks are happened at midnight of the Deepawali in nationwide in India, from small village areas to urban regions (Nirmalkar et al., 2013; Ambade et al., 2018). Almost every Indian family celebrates the Deepawali festival via bursting firecrackers. Massive firecracker burning event during Deepawali festival leads to deteriorating air quality as well as increasing human health risk. During fireworks emission, there is a drastic increase in aerosol mass abundance and the ambient air is also contaminated with detrimental atmospheric particulate matters (PM). The mass level of submicron particulate matters containing metals can penetrate into the deeper region of the human respiratory system. Enormous inhalable metal containing PMs are released due to firecracker burning during Deepawali festival (Godri et al., 2010; Nirmalkar et al., 2013). Throughout the Deepawali festival, the PM10 abundance is found to be 2\u20136 folds higher than the normal days (Joly et al., 2010; Segura et al., 2013). Firecrackers burning events discharge organic and inorganic matter into the air, which induces turbid atmosphere and dense clouds, the nature of which depends upon the constituents of the firecrackers. Gunpowder, KNO3, and color producing metals like, Aluminum (Al), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), Iron (Fe) and Potassium (K) are the common constituents of firecrackers. Hence, they produce various chemical species in the atmosphere which have harmful human health effects (Vecchi et al., 2008). Smoke particles from the fireworks emission penetrate through the respiratory system and generate health problems like cough, fever, and dyspnoea and also cause acute eosinophilic pneumonia (Hirai et al., 2000; Barnett et al., 2005; Hamad et al., 2016).",

Atmospheric aerosols have three distinct modes i.e., coarse mode, droplet mode, and condensation mode. The coarse mode has a size from 2 to 50 \u03bcm, similarly, droplet mode has the size of 0.5\u20132 \u03bcm; whereas, condensation mode particles have 0.1\u20130.5 \u03bcm size. Size distribution studies not only provide information about human health implications but also, it decides the overall fate of particle into the atmosphere like long-range transportation, existence in the atmosphere, i.e., their lifetime and deposition rate to the Earth's surface (Sing et al., 2002). Earlier studies of the elemental composition of aerosols formed during such firecracker bursting events were usually focused on total suspended particles (TSP), either PM10 or PM2.5 size ranges but its associated studies with metal particulate matters are very scanty.",

This study presents time-series variation of coarse and fine size fractions of firework tracer metal aerosols in all three events. Probable potential penetration of particles containing metal aerosols through respiratory system and associated diseases are discussed.",

The analytical errors in the triplicate analyses of the filter samples were estimated to be 5% for OC and EC both. The concentration of total carbon (TC) was calculated by summing the concentrations of OC and EC in each size fraction. As carbonate carbon (CC) also contributes to the TC in ambient aerosols, a sample aliquot was fumigated with HCl to get the peak position for CC and the correction for CC was done after verifying the thermogram.",

Significantly high abundance of firework aerosol tracer metals has been observed in the present work when compared with other studies (Perrino et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2012). Aluminum was found to be the most abundant during all the events in all size fractions and Mg was the least abundant both in ultra-fine as well as fine mode size fraction during all the events, i.e., BDP, DDP and ADP. The order of abundance of metals in ultra-fine mode size fraction during BDP, DDP and ADP were found to be Al, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Mg; Al, Zn, Cu, Fe, K, Ca, Na, Mg and Al, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Mg, respectively. The order of abundance of metals in fine mode was seen to be Al, Fe, Ca, Cu, Zn, K, Na and Mg during BDP; whereas, during DDP, metals were found in the order of Al, Cu, Zn, Fe, K, Ca, Na and Mg. Similarly, during ADP metals were obtained in the order of Al, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ca, K, Na, and Mg. In this table, it could be found that coarse mode was dominated by the metals in the order of Al > Fe > Ca > Cu > Zn > Mg > K > Na and Al > K > Zn > Fe > Cu > Ca > Mg > Na, during BDP and DDP, respectively. We have found high mass loading of metals during DDP when compared with BDP and ADP. Tandon et al. (2008) reported that some specific elements are used in the firecrackers for specific purpose like S as propellant, Cu and Fe are used as color producing agents, whereas K and Na are used as oxidizers, Mg is used as fuel and Zn is used for smoke effect etc. Moreno et al. (2007) has also reported that metal salts of K and Ca like, KNO3 and KClO3 or KClO4 are used for combustion and color producing. It can be also seen from the table that abundance of all metals was highest in the fine mode over coarse mode (except Ca and K) during DDP because the burning of crackers emits freshly borne elements into the air, which causes size distribution dominated in fine mode. The metals selected as markers (Fe, Ca, Cu, Zn, K, Na and Mg) of firecrackers emission were similar to an earlier study conducted by Pervez et al. (2014). Besides the firecracker's emission, there are also possibilities of Al, Ca and Fe to come from coal ash-based cementation material, which is used in civil constructions and iron processing industries. Similarly, Al and Cu may also come from road traffic. Household solid fuel burning and kerosene burning can also emit K, which is a biomass burning tracer. Zn can be possibly originating from steel processing industries (Matawle et al., 2014). Deshmukh et al. (2017) reported the major sources of Na and Ca as sea salt and mineral dust in Raipur.",

Similar trends were observed for coarse mode carbonaceous aerosols during BDP, DDP and ADP. The results indicated that the OC during DDP concentration was 3.5-folds and 3.7-folds higher than the emissions observed during normal days in ultra-fine and fine modes, respectively. Other possible sources of OC at eastern central India are both primary and secondary; primary sources include anthropogenic and natural emissions, whereas they may also form via secondary processes like heterogenic chemical reactions and gas to particles conversion (Wang et al., 2012). Similarly, significantly high abundance of EC was obtained during extreme firework days for ultra-fine (5.5-folds) and fine modes (5.4-fold) than during the normal days. However, EC can be also directly emitted from biomass burning and combustion of fossil fuels as primary aerosols in nature.",

The DDP period was observed to have high concentration of fine mode POC. Gaseous pollutants emitted from fireworks events could be responsible for triggering the significant secondary formation in atmosphere of eastern central India. SOC was found to be high during DDP that must be due to secondary formation and gas to particles conversion, and further the fine mode particles were converted to coarse mode by agglomeration. Fine mode POC, WSOC, and SOC were found higher compared to ultra-fine and coarse modes during DDP, ADP and BDP, respectively. Generally, burning activities release gases that condense over fine particles, as fine particles have larger surface area, which can provide suitable conditions for condensation of aerosols (Engling et al., 2009; Levin et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019).

The coarse mode loading is also significant because of prevailed meteorology offering more suitable conditions for secondary formation by accelerating the heterogeneous reactions in aerosols, which results in the formation of coarse particles onto pre-existed aerosols (Huang et al., 2006). The POC concentration was dominated in coarse mode over fine mode during entire study period. Besides the firecracker's emissions, EC and POC both may come from primary emissions and such loading with significant contribution of WSOC in coarse mode indicates that the study site is under the influence of significant burning emissions, i.e., biomass burning. Fine mode WSOC concentration was found to be higher during DDP followed by BDP and ADP. Wang et al. (2012) have reported that WSOC are mainly from secondary formation and biomass burning processes.

Hence, the reason for coarse mode Mg in our study is from the mixture of sources during ADP and BDP, whereas the fine mode peak of Mg is probably due to firecrackers emission because Mg is used as fuel for firecrackers that contributed to fine mode particles during DDP.",

During the DDP, comparatively more intense peak at fine mode (0.43\u20131.1 \u03bcm) indicates the high burning activities and fine particles emission. For Na, a dominated peak at coarse mode is previously observed in Raipur potentially due to sea salt and mineral dust from soil dust resuspension (Deshmukh et al., 2017). However, during DDP, fine mode peak appeared for Na was possibly due to extreme firecrackers burning because Na is used commonly in the firecrackers as oxidizer (Pervez et al., 2014).",

Whereas coarse mode dominated peak at 4.7\u20139 \u03bcm size range was observed in the other two events. This indicated that there must be different sources which were also influencing the air mass during DDP. During DDP intense peak in fine mode was due to the mixture of two major sources, namely, firecrackers emission and biomass burning activities. Yamasoe et al. (2000) have also found bimodal size distribution of K with fine mode peak reported was due to biomass burning and coarse mode peak reported was due to mineral dust and sea salt. The possible sources of coarse mode K was reported to be sea salts and soil dust particles (Huang et al., 2012). The K derived from firecrackers emission is mostly enriched in fine mode, however, possibilities of K from firecrackers towards the coarse mode is less significant. Because firecrackers mostly release gaseous species and freshly borne fine particles in the atmosphere. Deshmukh et al. (2017, 2016) reported the fine mode peak of K from biomass burning and coarse mode peak was due to soil dust particle and sea salts at Raipur aerosols. Based on the strong correlation of K with other sea salt and mineral dusts derived species they reported sea salt and dusts particles as source for significant coarse mode peak of K. They also conducted air mass trajectory analysis to find the possible transported ways of sea salt derived K at Raipur.",

The OC itself contains many fractions like POC, SOC, and WSOC (Tang et al., 2016). The carbonaceous aerosols are derived from diverse sources. The atmospheric variables like, relative humidity, ambient temperature, wind speed and boundary layer dynamics also play significant role towards the total OC loading (Jurado et al., 2008; Nirmalkar et al., 2020). Apart from the emission sources and their emission strength, the atmospheric variables are major causes that control the size distribution of carbonaceous aerosols. The SOC formation during the aging process is also significant at Raipur. Hence, the extent of POC and SOC along with atmospheric variables could be the reason for large deviation in the carbonaceous aerosols loading at urban area of Raipur. In addition, firecrackers burning activities and their delayed effect could add a significant carbonaceous component in the troposphere during DDP and ADP. Hence, it can be concluded that the dynamics of boundary layers, atmospheric variables, diverse sources and their emission strength, SOA formation and atmospheric aging were the possible reasons for large deviation in the size distribution of carbonaceous aerosols.",

WSOC like levoglucosan and mannosan are highly water-soluble species produced from biomass burning activities (Fu et al., 2010). In the present work, coarse mode peak for WSOC was significantly high in comparison to fine mode because coarse mode WSOC are formed via aggregation or heterogenous reaction of primary aerosols in the particles phase (Miyazaki et al., 2011). The smaller particles having large surface area provide more exposure to chemical reactions that triggers aging to form the coarse particles (Kanakidou et al., 2005).

Strong correlations were found between Zn and Al (r2 = 0.53), Cu and Fe (r2 = 0.82), and Cu and Ca (r2 = 0.49).

It could be observed from the figure that all the DDP events have high loading compared to BDP and ADP. During DDP bursting firecrackers had led to an increase in fine particles over coarse particles. During DDP, all coarse particles had high loading over other events because of the particle's growth. It has been reported that fine particles can accumulate or condense together to form coarse particles (Pandey et al., 2012). Similar variation trends towards increase and decrease in concentration of metals were found among the pairs, Fe\u2013Al and Na\u2013Zn during DDP only.

However, no significant attempts were made on the atmospheric aging associated with fireworks particles in ultra-fine, fine and coarse size fractions. It is emphasized that during DDP period the contribution of anthropogenic sources other than the fireworks emissions were less, so the atmosphere during DDP period days was mainly influenced from the significant contribution of fireworks, atmospheric aging processes, dispersion, deposition and transformations of particles. Sarkar et al. (2010) have reported that the primary pollutants like NOx, SO2 etc. emitted during fireworks may act as oxidizer to form secondary organic and inorganic aerosols or may get adsorbed on pre-existed aerosols particles. Significantly high WSOC/OC ratio was observed during DDP (Table 2) events indicated high loading of atmospherically aged particles in firework days. Low wind speed and lower boundary layer height facilitates trapping the gaseous pollutants near ground level, and high relative humidity triggers the formation of SOA that further condenses over pre-existing aerosols (Sotiropoulou et al., 2006). This could be the reason for significant coarse mode loading of aerosols suggesting occurrence of atmospheric aerosols aging in eastern central India during DDP. Many of the other works have reported the significant secondary formation of NH4\n+, NO3\n\u2212 and SO4\n2\u2212 from gases released from fireworks burning (Wang et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2014). Do et al. (2012) reported that soot-EC is directly emitted from fireworks. They have found strong correlation between NO\u2212\n3 (r2 = 0.47) and SO2-\n4 (r2 = 0.56) indicating that both of these chemical species adhere on to soot particles. In another work OC/EC ratio of 6.8 was reported during fireworks in Chinese New Year festival, which was reported to be due to the high enrichment of OC1, OC2 and OPC. All carbonaceous fractions are related to volatile nature of organic matters used for firecrackers production. The reported smelting points of ployxyethylene, polyvinyl alcohol and shell-lac were 212, 230 and 115\u2013120 \u00b0C, respectively, and all these temperatures were less than the detecting temperature of OC2 fraction, i.e., 230 \u00b0C (Zhang et al., 2013). Accordingly, in our work too, these carbonaceous aerosols fractions (OC1 and OC2) were directly emitted to the atmosphere from fireworks. It is quite interesting to note that although aging process includes the coarse particles formation which have relatively lower health risks compared to fine particles, but the aged particles are highly contaminated with metals, carbonaceous aerosols and secondary organic aerosols which can cause high health risks.",

In addition, coarse particles abundance during DDP was also found highest over ADP and BDP. The reason possibly may be the growth of the fine particles because they can condense together and form larger particles.

Cilia and mucus of respiratory tract filter particles with larger than 10 \u03bcm size but particles with less than 10 \u03bcm diameter are inhalable particles. They accommodate in the upper respiratory system but if inhaled it would be discarded by coughing and sneezing (Kim et al., 2015). Particles with size <2.5 \u03bcm and <1 \u03bcm are given more attention because of their extreme bad health impact due to their deeper approach into the human respiratory system (Dockery, 2001). Several studies conducted worldwide have reported occurrence of major diseases due to bad air quality, i.e., cardiovascular dysfunction, acute asthma, decreased lung function, lower resistance to foreign substances, etc. (Tapanainen et al., 2012). Some indoor and outdoor burning sources of aerosols have been reported carcinogenic (Vu et al., 2012; Canha et al., 2016). Air pollutants analysis at global level shows that atmospheric particulates are responsible for the 5% cancer cases (lung, trachea, bronchi), 2% cases of mortality due to cardio-respiratory problems and 1% mortality due to the respiratory infections (Bryce et al., 2005).",

Fireworks emitted new borne fine particles to the atmosphere that was the reason of high loading of fine particles. However, the gaseous precursors emitted from firecrackers burning also adhered onto the surface of the mineral dust particles justifying a valid reason for the significant contribution of the coarse mode loading of metals at Raipur during DDP. High abundance of metals was observed in the present work when compared with other studies of fireworks emissions events like Spring festival, Sant Joan firework, etc. events from different countries (Moreno et al., 2010; Deka and Hoque, 2014; Kong et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In the present work, size distributed aerosol samples were analyzed for metals and carbonaceous aerosols during BDP, DDP and ADP period in 2018 at eastern central India. In ultra-fine and fine mode particles size the abundance of metals during DDP was found to be high for Al followed by Cu, Zn, Fe, K, Ca, Na and Mg. Bimodal size distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. A common bimodal size distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K in all three events possibly due to biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP indicated couple of sources such as firecrackers emission along with biomass burning. During DDP, K and Ca were well correlated together, which was not found during BDP. It clearly indicated similar source of K and Ca, i.e., firecrackers burning, during DDP. Strong correlations between metal pairs Zn\u2013Fe, Cu\u2013Fe and Cu\u2013Ca have been found. The salts of these metals are commonly mixed together in firecrackers to produce different colors on burning. This possibly gives a justifiable reason for such strong positive correlation among tracer metals in aerosols during Deepawali festival. The significant metals and carbonaceous aerosols were found during ADP in coarse fine and ultrafine size fractions. This should be significant residence time of atmospheric aerosols. Fire-crackers derived atmospheric aerosols were found to be existed several days after the firecrackers burning event and can alter the atmospheric chemistry. Fine particles can approach lower respiratory tract, i.e., trachea, and alveoli, so they are more harmful entities over coarse particles. The extreme fireworks in Deepawali festivals have apparently altered the compositions of size-distributed aerosols with elevated metals and organic matters loading. The contributions of SOC formed by gas to particle conversion gradually rose in firework days during aging processes. The particles emitted from fireworks obviously underwent aging processes as we have found significant coarse mode loading of metals and carbonaceous aerosols during firework days. Aging of particles were characterized by heterogeneous reactions of directly emitted NOx and SO2 from fireworks on particles in the troposphere. The outcomes of this work will be useful to understanding the compositions of size distributed particles and aging processes of firework emissions. It also highlights the importance of controlling intensive firecrackers burning in order to protect air quality from deterioration and reduce the respiratory problems.",
