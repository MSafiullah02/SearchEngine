A novel coronavirus (CoViD-19) was identified as the source of the disease by the Chinese authorities on January 7, 2020. Eventually, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020 named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Concerns on public health were dispersed on a global scale about potentially infected countries. The virus might have been generated by animal populations and transmitted via the Huanan wholesale market [2], [3], [4] albeit not proven, while clinical findings demonstrated that international spread was caused mainly by commercial air travel [4], [5], [6], [7]. The WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Throughout the globe, huge efforts were in progress to limit the spread of the virus and find medications and vaccines. However, the scientific community could not fully comprehend the dynamics of the spread [8], [9], [10].",

            "text": "Insights from mathematical modelling can be extremely beneficial. Indeed, dealing with infectious diseases from a mathematical angle could reveal inherent patterns and underlying structures that govern outbreaks. Stakeholders utilize available data from current and previous outbreaks in order to forecast infection rates, identify how to restrict the spread of diseases, and eventually introduce vaccination policies that will be most effective. Epidemiology is essentially a biology discipline concerned with public health and as such, it can be heavily influenced by mathematical theory. Most phenomena observed at population level are often very complex and difficult to decode just by observing the characteristics of isolated individuals [17]. Statistical analyses of epidemiological data help to characterize, quantify and summarize the way diseases spread in host populations. Interestingly, mathematical models appear as efficient ways to explore and test various epidemiological hypotheses, mostly due to the existence of ethical and practical limitations when deducting experiments on living populations. Models provide conceptual results on e.g., the basic reproduction number, threshold effects or herd immunity. One additional element of epidemiological modeling is the link with data via statistical methods. Although simple epidemiological models are often used, viral and bacterial infections commonly require increased complexity. There are many models in the literature on single epidemics, endemic diseases and spatiotemporal disease dynamics. The aim is to develop robust public health policies in defining optimal vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "In short, a single epidemic outbreak as opposed to disease endemicity occurs in a time span short enough not to have the demographic changes perturbing the dynamics of contacts among individuals. The most popular mathematical model in this category is the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model, in which all individuals of a finite population interact in the same manner. Individuals at time t are susceptible (S), infected (I) or recovered (R). The final size of the epidemic will strongly depend upon the initial conditions of the number of susceptible and infected individuals as well as the infection parameter. The final size distribution of the simple SIR model in most cases is bimodal presenting two local maxima. This bimodal feature is caused by two likely scenarios; either the epidemic dies out quickly infecting few individuals, or it becomes long-lasting and substantial. However, stochasticity in the form of random walk transmission mechanisms related to spreading processes has never been explored in epidemiology widely [18], [19], [20]. For example, in computer science, some artificially created viruses propagate randomly by a plethora of online communication channels. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to scrutinize extensively the role of random walks in epidemic spreading and provide the proper mathematical arsenal to model it robustly. Interestingly, random walk paths converge in distribution to Brownian motions [21]. In this work, we assume that a biological carrier of virus Y is at position X(t) at any given time t. We call this the inaugural contamination focal point on earth.",

Xt, t \u2265 0 is supposed to follow a Brownian motion on a 2-dimensional sphere S\n2 of radius a, i.e the sphere in R of dimension 3. We consider this a proxy for earth, spreading via spherical and stereographic coordinates. Next, using the Laplace-Beltrami operator we construct the Brownian motion infectious process on the 2-dimensional sphere, using spherical and stereographic coordinates as local coordinates. We evaluate explicitly certain quantities related to generated diffusion processes. In what follows, we compute the transition and transmission density for the Xt, t \u2265 0, and we derive the stochastic differential equations that govern the infectious disease dynamics for Xt, t \u2265 0 in those local coordinates. We continue with the calculation of expectations of outbreak exit times in time and space of specific domains, possessing certain symmetries. Moreover, the moment generating functions are produced. In mathematical terms, we derive the stochastic reflection principle on S\n2 for the infectious disease transmission process. Reflection points can be extremely useful to calculate the distribution functions of certain temporal quantities related to the dynamics. Additionally, we evaluate boundary local times of first hitting of the outbreak for an epidemic or a hybrid endemic-epidemic model. Hence, biological carrier(s) of a virus (infectious individuals) are tracked at any given time on earth coordinates, and the path(s) defined by each infectious dynamical motion. In the following two chapters we present a thorough literature review and a state-of-the-art analysis in order to pose clearly our novel approach optimally among the various methodologies followed thus far.",

            "text": "The beginning of mathematical modeling in epidemiology dates back to 1766, when Bernoulli developed a mathematical model to analyze the mortality of smallpox in England [22]. Bernoulli used his model to show that inoculation against the virus would increase the life expectancy at birth by about three years. A revision of the main findings and a presentation of the criticism by D\u2019Alembert, appears recently in Dietz and Heesterbeek [23]. Lambert in 1772 as well as Laplace in 1812 extended the Bernoulli model by incorporating age-dependent parameters [24], [25]. However, further systematic research was absent until the beginning of the twentieth century with the pioneering work of Ross in 1911, which is considered the inaugural study of modern mathematical epidemiology [26]. Ross used a set of equations to approximate the discrete-time dynamics of malaria via a mosquito-based pathogen transmission [27]. Importantly, the past century has witnessed the rapid emergence and development of substantial theories in epidemics. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [28] derived the celebrated threshold theorem, which is one of the key results in epidemiology. It predicts \u2013 depending on the transmission potential of the infection \u2013 the critical fraction of susceptibles in the population that must be exceeded if an epidemic is to occur. Kermack and McKendrick published three seminal papers, establishing what is called the deterministic compartmental epidemic modelling [29], [30], [31], wherein they addressed the mass\u2013action incident in disease transmission cycles, assuming that the probability of infection of a susceptible is analogous to the number of its contacts with infected individuals. This deterministic representation was in line with the Law of Mass Action [32] introduced by Guldberg and Waage in 1864 and renders the basic most commonly used SIR model, which assumes homogeneous mixing of the contacts and conservation of the total population and low rates of interaction. MacDonald extended Ross\u2019s model to explain in depth the transmission process of malaria. Utilizing modern computer power, the mathematical model for the dynamics and the control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens provided robust results in real-word applications. Overall, the family of models they introduced is known by now as Ross\u2013MacDonald models [33]. Moreover, the classic work of Bartlett [34] examined models and data to explore the factors that determine disease persistence in large populations. Arguably, a landmark book on mathematical modelling of epidemiological systems was published by Bailey [35] and highlighted the importance of public health decision making [36]. Given the diversity of infectious diseases studied since the middle of the 1950s, an impressive variety of epidemiological models have been developed. In addition, we should highlight the 19th century works by Enko [37], [38], [39], who first published a probabilistic model for describing the epidemic of measles, yet in discrete time. This model is the precursor of the popular Reed-Frost chain binomial model introduced by Frost in 1928 in biostatistics\u2019 lectures at Johns Hopkins University [40]. It assumes that the infection spreads from an infected to a susceptible individual via a discrete time Markov chain, and set the basis of contemporary stochastic epidemic modelling, on which we will also focus in our present work.",

In this study they concluded that temperature seasonality might be a source of the disease, yet they suggested for the first time that controlling markets could help controlling outbreaks. Lee and Pietz [42] developed a mathematical model for Zika virus using logistic growth in human populations. Sun et al., [43] proposed a transmission model for cholera in China and observed that reducing the spread requires extensive immunization coverage of the population. Nishiura et al. [44] developed a Zika mathematical model which exhibited the same dynamics as dengue fever, and Khan et al. [45] introduced a model whereby a saturation function describes well the typhoid fever dynamics. Gui and Zhang [46], developed a modified SIR model demonstrating nonlinearities in recovery rates. Their model exhibited a backward bifurcation phenomenon, which in turn implied that a plain reduction of the reproduction number less than one, was not rendered sufficient to stop the disease spread. Li et al. [47] constructed a multi-group brucellosis model and found out that the best way to contain the disease is to avoid cross infection of animal populations. Moreover, Yu and Lin [48] identified complex dynamical behaviour in epidemiological models and particularly the existence of multiple limit cycle bifurcations using a predictor-prey model. Shi et al. [49] proposed an HIV model with a saturated reverse function to describe the dynamics of infected cells. Additionally, Bonyah et al. [50] developed a SIR model to study the dynamics of buruli ulcer and suggested policy measures to control the disease. Lastly, Zhang et al. [51] developed a model with a latent period of the disease wherein the person is not infectious with saturated incidence rates and treatment functions, called SEIR epidemic model.",

On the other hand, stochastic models describe the mean trend as well as the variance structure of the underlying processes. Two basic types of stochasticity are commonly used: demographic and environmental. Within the context of demographic stochasticity, all individuals are subject to the same potential events with the exact same probabilities but differences in the fates of population individuals. Disease propagation in large populations obeys to the weak law of large numbers, thus effects of demographic stochasticity can be decreased significantly, and many times a deterministic model becomes more suitable. However, random events cannot be neglected and a stochastic model can be equally appropriate. Environmental stochasticity involves variations in the probability associated with an exogenous event. Model parameters of stochastic models are characterized by probability distributions, whilst for fixed parameter values deterministic models will always produce the same results, except when chaotic behaviour emerges.",

Usually, random variables describe the time of recovery since infection. For discrete random variables (e.g., number of individuals) it is easy to define a probability distribution, whilst for continuous variables the time of recovery since infection is modelled. Often, in this last category it is not possible to fix a probability as there is infinity of such times. Hence, we first define a cumulative distribution and then express a probability density function from this cumulative distribution. Infectious periods are exponentially distributed with a mean infectious duration, however as frequently real data does not back up this assumption, we rather use constant duration. To account for such more realistic distributions, the assumption that the probability of recovery does not depend on the time since infection, is often relaxed. Then, a common method of stages can be used to replace the infective compartment by a series of successive ones, each with an exponential distribution of the same parameter, leading to a total duration of the infectious period modelled by a gamma distribution [17].",

For longer periods, deaths and births feed the population with new susceptibles, possibly allowing the disease to persist at a constant prevalence. This state renders an endemic state in the population [17]. In this case, we account for birth and death rate of the host population, whereby a good approximation is that the population size N=S+I+R is constant. When deterministic dynamics prevail a threshold on the value of the basic reproduction number exists. Conditions regarding this number guarantee the disease persistence, but in epidemic models such persistence can be dependent upon the magnitude of the stochastic fluctuations around the steady-state equilibrium. Furthermore, many times diseases are in an endemo-epidemic state. As endemic models exhibit damped oscillations which converge toward an endemic equilibrium, this equilibrium can be weakly stable with perturbations (intrinsic or extrinsic), which excite and sustain the inherent oscillation behaviour [57]. This behaviour is due to heterogeneity that is added temporally to the coefficient of transmission, spatially in the context of meta-populations, or by cohorts for age-structured models. Lastly, heterogeneity can be added statistically in case of stochastic versions. For example, a stochastic version of the endemic SIR model can utilize a Markov process, in which the future is independent of the past given the present, with a state space defined by the number of individuals in each of the three classes, and changes in the state space characterized by probabilistic transition events. And as future events are independent on past events, the time to the next event follows a negative exponential distribution.",

As we pointed out, many shortcomings exist for those models. All the models already used in the literature assume that the host population has constant size. However, this excludes diseases in exponentially growing populations as in most developing countries, or disease-induced mortality as childhood diseases in developing countries e.g., malaria. Modeling infectious dynamics in non-stationary host populations requires explicit modeling of the host population as well as of the disease per se. Models sometimes can be highly complicated in order to improve best fit to real data. Nonetheless, very complex models do not always perform optimally in real-world applications or in simulations. Real-world models allow for swift decision making, and suitable quantification of the spatiotemporal dynamics of an outbreak. Multidisciplinary research efforts are speeding up, integrating the advances in epidemiology, molecular biology, computational science and applied mathematics. Mathematical modeling allows better understanding of the transmission process of infectious diseases in space and time, by setting forth rigorously the proper assumptions, the variables, the equations and their parameters.",

Simulations or brute-force computational techniques have been implemented in that direction to provide approximate solutions with encouraging results. Nevertheless, some of the underlying generating processes of the outbreaks, such as the virus pathogenicity or variant social network topologies, ethnological characteristics and other quantities, may influence the spread of an outbreak. Simulations often prove to be inefficient for the systematic analysis of an emergent epidemic. New rigorous mathematical modeling methodologies, such as the one presented in this work for the first time, can be used to address inherent incomplete data structure and hidden nonlinear complex dynamics, with an aim to enhance forecastability in combating epidemic outbreaks.",

We explicitly described the mathematical framework underpinning the implementation and conceptualization of our new-age epidemiological model. Our goal is to contribute to the arsenal of models already developed so far. It can be of particular interest, in light of a recent intensive worldwide effort to speed up the establishment of a global surveillance network for combating pandemics of emergent and re-emergent infectious diseases. Toward this aim, mathematical modeling will play a major role in assessing, controlling and forecasting potential outbreaks. We have to better understand and model the impact of numerous variables on contagious dynamics, ranging from the microscopic host\u2013pathogen level, to individual and population interactions, as well as macroscopic environmental, social, economic and demographic factors all over the world.",
