This disease is prevalent throughout the world and affects the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying birds, thereby causing severe economic loss within the poultry industry. IB can affect chickens of all ages and result in respiratory disease, nephritis, proventriculitis, and decrease in egg production and egg quality [1\u20133]. Furthermore, this disease is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections that cause increased mortality. It may be the most economically important viral respiratory tract disease of chickens in countries and regions where there is no highly pathogenic avian influenza virus or velogenic (highly pathogenic) Newcastle disease virus [4].",

Since there is lack of cell lines to support the growth of IBV, 9- to 11-day-old embryo inoculation via the allantoic route is commonly used for virus isolation. The characteristic embryo changes, such as dwarfing, stunting, or curling of embryos, can be observed between 2 and 7 days after the inoculation. This type of diagnosis assay has been used for many years. However, for most of the field samples, several blind passages (more than three times) were needed before typical characteristic embryo changes can be observed, and interpretation of the results was subjective. In addition, this method is time consuming (2\u20137 days for each passage are needed before embryo lesions can be observed) and expensive (requires a large amount of embryos) [4, 6, 7].",

Furthermore, a nested set of IBV subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) is produced via a discontinuous transcription mechanism, and the N gene and 3\u2032 UTR are the most abundant productions during transcription [14, 15]. These characteristics demonstrate that the N gene and 3\u2032 UTR of IBV are the appropriate candidates for molecular diagnosis. In our epidemiology surveillance of IBV in China, we have successfully used a set of primers targeting the N gene and 3\u2032 UTR to detect IBV in allantoic fluids of embryos inoculated with tissue, oropharyngeal, and cloacal swab samples. In this chapter, we describe the procedures of one-step RT-PCR for the detection of IBV from a range of sample types that were used in our IBV epidemiology surveillance studies. This assay together with virus isolation is designed specifically for the rapid detection of serotypes of IBV from clinical samples.",

            "text": "\nIn order to determine the sensitivity of the diagnostic IBV RT-PCR assay, we compared this assay with the current standard test, virus isolation in SPF embryos. A tenfold dilution series of the IBV H120 strain (107 EID50) was prepared; 200 \u03bcl of each dilution was tested in parallel by both tests. The limit of detection of virus isolation was 0.5 \u00d7 101 EID50, while the limit of detection of the RT- PCR was 500 EID50. These results showed that this IBV RT-PCR assay is less sensitive than virus isolation for the IBV-infected allantoic fluid. However, we found that after inoculating tissue and oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old to 11-day-old SPF embryos, this IBV RT-PCR assay can efficiently detect the IBV in allantoic fluids, and no extra blind passage is needed. In practice, we have successfully used this assay together with virus isolation, to detect most serotypes of IBV from clinical samples during our epidemiology surveillance of IBV in China.Swab sample collection: IBV isolates can infect a large range of epithelial surfaces including respiratory tissues and non-respiratory tissues of chicken. Since the primary target tissue for IBV is the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs is a good choice for detection of IBV especially in the early stages of infection due to that IBV persists in the respiratory tract for a relatively short time after infection. For collecting oropharyngeal swab samples, insert swab into the bird\u2019s throat and leave it in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions.It is considered that replication of IBV in intestinal tract normally does not cause clinical disease, although it does result in faecal excretion of the virus. The excretion of IBV in the faeces may be associated with apparent long-term persistence of IBV in chicken flocks. Therefore, cloacal swab is the material of choice to detect IBV. For collecting cloacal swab samples, insert swab into the bird\u2019s cloaca and stir for a few seconds to stick faeces.The selection of tissue material for IBV isolation or detection is critical because IBV can affect many tissues, involving the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems. In our previous study, we have successfully detected the IBV from kidney, proventriculus, trachea, and caecal tonsil from commercial chickens. In practice, trachea tissue can be chosen for IBV detection when chicken showed respiratory symptoms. In addition, kidney and caecal tonsil are candidate materials when investigating kidney infection or declined egg laying performance. If swelling of the proventriculus, the characteristic changes of infected chickens, occurs, proventriculus can be selected as sample for IBV detection.In order to detect as many IBV serotypes as possible, N protein genes from 228 IBV strains available in GenBank were aligned using the MegAlign application in the Lasergene software package [16]. The forward primer N (+) targeting a conserved region of IBV N gene and reverse primer N (\u2212) targeting the conversed 3\u2032 UTR of the IBV genome were designed. We have successfully detected the Massachusetts, 4/91, LX4, CK/CH/LSC/99I, CK/CH/LDL/97I, and Connecticut type of IBV serotypes by using this pair of primers.The Georgia 98, Arkansas, and Florida (isolated from USA), Australian Group 1, 2, and 3 (identified in Australia), Italy02, and D274 (predominant IBV types identified in Europe, except 793B, Massachusetts, and LX4 types) have not to be tested, due to that these isolates are unavailable in our laboratory. However, the primers N (+) and N (\u2212) could also be used to detect these IBV types, because the primers are targeting highly conserved regions among these IBV strains. It should be noted that although the primer targeting regions are conserved, N gene and 3\u2032-terminal region of 3\u2032 UTR show certain variations among different serotypes. It is likely that primers N (+) and N (\u2212) may need slight modification to increase their universality for other IBV serotypes that have not been tested in our study. For example, degeneracy of primers should be considered which has been successfully applied in detection of viruses with genetic diversity.We prepare homogenized tissue suspensions by using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Germany) which has been widely applied to sample preparation. The 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes with stainless steel beads for tissue disruption should be sterilized. Precooling the Tissue Lyser Adapter Set in \u221280 \u00b0C can reduce the RNA degradation in the process of sample preparation.The repeated freeze-thaw cycles should facilitate viruses releasing from infected tissues. We aliquot the prepared samples ( tissue and swab samples) into separate tubes, one tube for virus isolation and subsequent RNA extraction and the others kept at \u221280 \u00b0C for long-term storage.Filtration of tissue and swab samples is not recommended because this step will reduce virus titer.During the RNA extraction process, the most important preventative measure is to avoid RNA degradation caused by RNase contamination. All pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes should be RNase-free and glove and mask should be worn.The RNA pellet is often invisible and locates at the side and bottom of the tube. Discarding the supernatant should be performed carefully without touching the RNA pellet.Do not allow the RNA to dry completely, which reduces the solubility of the RNA.The one-step RT-PCR kit is employed to reduce the amount of handling required. In our laboratory, we have successfully used it to amplify RT- PCR products of between 1052 and 2849 bp in length from clinical samples.General procedures to prevent PCR cross-contamination should be strictly followed. In order to prevent the detection of false positive, which may occur owing to cross-contamination, preparation of the master mix for RT-PCR should be carried out in an isolated room separate from areas used for sample processing and RNA extraction. If possible, each step of the whole process including sample processing, RT-PCR, and post-PCR analysis should be carried out in separated rooms.To ensure the reliability of results, multiple positive and negative controls should be included in the RT-PCR reactions, especially when unknown clinical samples are tested. The negative control consists of a sample containing only the RT- PCR mix without RNA (2 \u03bcl of water is added instead of RNA). RNA of IBV (e.g., H120) can be used as positive control.When adding the RNA samples to the RT-PCR mix, precaution must be taken to avoid RNA cross-contamination. Avoiding the formation of aerosols by using aerosol-resistant filtered pipette tips can prevent the false-positive results due to cross-sample contamination caused by aerosol spraying.\n",
