Consequently, fluoroquinolone prescriptions have increased in some countries among adults with chronic heart and lung disease, who are prone to develop respiratory tract infections [2, 3].",

Reports from Europe, the US, and Canada showed levels of resistance to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin below 2 % [2\u20134]. Three major events may have contributed to this low level of resistance: the replacement of the old fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin by the more active levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and, probably, the fact that fluoroquinolones are rarely used in children [5].",

In this study, we found that the most important risk factors for infection with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were current residence in public shelters, preceding hospitalization, previous treatment with fluoroquinolones, HIV infection and immunosuppression, chronic C virus hepatitis, drug abuse, heavy alcohol intake, smoking, and chronic obstructive lung disease. However, only living in public shelters, previous hospitalization, HIV infection, and heavy smoking were independently associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. The strong association with residence in public shelters may suggest that, in fact, we are dealing with a cluster of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococcal infections. Although no systematical molecular typing was carried out, two serotype 8 strains of the present study, which have been previously typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for an earlier report [14], showed an identical pulse type. This fact indicates an epidemiological link between the strains.",

A survey of 21,521 invasive pneumococcal isolates from 2000 to 2006 by von Gottberg et al. [17] identified 12 cases of high-level levofloxacin resistance. All were HIV-infected children, nine were on therapy for tuberculosis, and ten isolates belonged to serotype 19F, suggesting clonal spread. It is interesting to note that two of our HIV-infected patients with invasive infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci had been treated with levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These findings suggest that the use of fluoroquinolones to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a risk factor for the endemic and clonal spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae [9].",

In some of these patients, levofloxacin therapy failed and they died of septic shock and other infective complications. However, the impact of levofloxacin resistance on outcome in adult patients with invasive pneumococcal infection remains controversial. In a recent study, levofloxacin resistance was associated with increased mortality, along with septic shock, prior use of corticosteroids, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [20]. In our study, associated mortality due to levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae was higher than that related to infection with levofloxacin-susceptible strains, but the data did not reach significance. Interestingly, in HIV-positive patients with infection due to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci, the associated mortality was also higher than that observed in their partners infected with levofloxacin-susceptible strains.",
