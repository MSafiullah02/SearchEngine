Significant differences between pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all P<0.05).

As of May 4, 2020, 3,356,205 laboratory-confirmed cases and 238,730 deaths have been reported [2] . Numerous studies have revealed the epidemiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Despite the fact that more than 80% of infected patients manifest with only mild clinical symptoms 3 , early identifying the risks of an adverse outcome remains the key to optimize management and improve survival. Previous studies found that advanced age and presence of comorbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease or hypertension) were risk factors associated with an adverse outcome such as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, or death [7, 8] .",

This resembled the prior reports of H1N1 pneumonia [17] . In contrast to other patterns, Pattern 1 may represent the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia and can be considered as mild illness group. Pathologically, organization has been recognized as a common response in lung injury [15, 23] . In this study, OP patterns accounted for 60% and the overall degree of lung injury in most cases especially for Pattern 2 was mild where reparative process and resolution of lesions seem to follow. Note that more prevalence of residuals may indicate a protracted disease course in Pattern 3. This may be related to the facts that Pattern 3 cases tend to be older with higher prevalence of comorbidity and decreased lymphocyte percentage. For Pattern 4, 85.7% cases had an adverse outcome. Pathologically, intraalveolar edema, fibrin, and variable cellular infiltrates with a hyaline membrane were observed in DAD [16,24]. Pattern 4 cases had more severe disease, more prevalence of elevated creatine kinase, neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein than other patterns. It may be such facts that led to the higher rate of adverse outcomes in Pattern 4.

A long-term follow up of discharged DAD patients who survived after mechanical ventilation or continuous high-flow oxygen therapy would be required to further understand the sequelae. All the above demonstrated the potentials of CT pattern categorization in predictive of prognosis in COVID-19. Diverse evolutions with overlaps of progression and downgrading were found in Pattern 0-2 within 3 weeks and Pattern 3-4 within 2 weeks after onset. Most of them remained thereafter. It is noting that 28.6% of Pattern 1 progressed to Pattern 2 from 2 to 3 weeks. This evolution was consistent with prior report of acute and progressive characteristics of COVID-19 [11]. In addition, this progression from Pattern 1 to 2 after 2 weeks may reflect the organization regarding lung repair and would have good prognosis [15]. From the above, individual CT pattern for prognostic implication can be determined within 2 weeks after onset due to the remarkable evolution of patterns before 2 weeks and subsequent stabilization or evolution without prognostic impacts. Univariate analysis indicated that age \u226565 years, presence of comorbidity (70% hypertension and diabetes mellitus), severe or critical illness, neutrophil percentage >75%, CT score \u226510, CT Pattern 4 were significantly related with adverse outcome.

This may be the underlying reason regarding Pattern 4 as only significant factor in multivariate analysis. This further enhanced the potential role of CT pattern in predicting the risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19.As for pulmonary sequelae, CT Pattern 3 or 4 and elevated C-reactive protein were two independent factors associated with pulmonary residuals on CT. Pattern 3 and 4 showed more prevalence of pulmonary residuals than others. This may be linked with more severe CT findings of these cases with more number of lobe affected and CT scores. In concert with MERS studies that radiological sequelae can remain at least 1 year after infection [27], our study found similar but slighter residuals mainly presenting with linear opacities and/or a few consolidation and GGO. Beyond, elevated C-reactive protein may indicate the state of tissue injury and/or acute inflammation. Continuous high levels of C-reactive protein in respiratory infections were suggestive of a risk indication of progression to a critical disease state[28]. In this regard, elevated C-reactive protein may be predictive of radiological sequelae. Prior studies indicated that radiological sequelae from SARS and MERS may suggest the abnormal or repaired lung function[27,29]. Despite the slight residuals in COVID-19, a long-term follow-up is required to further trace the resolution and associations with lung function.",
