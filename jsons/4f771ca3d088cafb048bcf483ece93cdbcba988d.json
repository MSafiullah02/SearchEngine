The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID-19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID-19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID-19 in India and some states. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing and lockdown strategies implemented in India are successfully reducing the spread and that the tempo of pandemic growth has slowed in recent days.",

It is named as novel because it is never seen before mutation of animal corona virus but certain source of this pandemic is still unidentified. It is said that the virus might be connected with a wet market (with seafood and live animals) from Wuhan that was not complying with health and safety rules and regulations.

Initially, there has been speculation about the virus spreading while the carrier (infected person) is not showing any symptoms, but that has not been confirmed as a scientific fact (Kachroo, 2020) . On 11 March 2020, WHO changed the status of the COVID-19 emergency from public health international emergency to a pandemic? Nonetheless, the fatality rate of the current pandemic is on the rise (between 2-4 percent); relatively lower than the previous SARS-CoV (2002/2003 ) and MERS-CoV (2012) outbreaks (Malik et al., 2020) . Thus, COVID-19 has presented an unprecedented challenge before the entire world.",

It is believed that symptoms may appear in 2 to 14 days, as the incubation period for the novel corona virus has not yet been confirmed. However, in India 14 days minimum quarantine period is declared by Government for suspected cases. Since it is a new type of virus, there is a lot of research being carried out across the world to understand the nature of the virus, origins of its spreads to humans, the structure of it, possible cure / vaccine to treat COVID-19. India also became a part of these research efforts after the first two confirmed cases were reported here on January 31, 2020. Then in India screening of traveler at airport migrant was started, immediate Chinese visas was canceled, and who was found affected from COVID-19 kept in quarantine centers (Ministry of Home Affaires Government of India, Advisory).",

Hence it is important to optimize testing by developing strategies to identify potential cases that have a higher chance of being infected. Since the availability of the resources like testing kits, labs, health personnel etc. is limited in India as for as concerned the population, the most practical approach is to test symptomatic patients presenting to hospitals, hotspots and aggressive testing to identify and contain local chains of transmission.",

Therefore, on 24 March 2020, the Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of the entire 1.3 billion population of India as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It was ordered after a 14-hour voluntary public curfew on 22 March. The lockdown was placed when the number of confirmed positive corona virus cases in India was approximately 500. On 14 April, Prime Minister of India extended the nationwide lockdown until 3 May, with a conditional relaxation after 20 April for some regions. On 1 May, the Government of India again extended the nationwide lockdown further by two weeks until 17 May. Also, the Government has divided the entire nation into three zones viz. green, red and orange with relaxations applied accordingly.",

This will also be helpful in estimating the health care requirements and sanction a measured allocation of resources. It is well known fact that COVID-19 has spread differently in different countries, any planning for increasing a fresh response has to be adaptable and situation-specific. Data obtained on COVID-19 outbreak have been studied by various researchers using different mathematical models ( Most of pandemics follow an exponential curve during the initial spread and eventually flatten out (Junling et al., 2014) . SIR model is one of the best suited models for projecting the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 where a person once recovered is not likely to become susceptible to the infection again (Kermack & McKendrick, 1991) . Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model (Herbert, 2000) is used to include considerations for susceptible, infectious, and recovered or deceased individuals. These models have shown a significant predictive ability for the growth of COVID-19 in India on a day-to-day basis so far. A recent study by Mandal et al., 2020 has shown that social distancing can reduce cases by up to 62 percent.",

In Table 3 an attempt has been made to show the summary statistics of tempo of COVID-19 t r during various lockdown periods in India. It is observed that average tempo is maximum (0.167 with standard deviation 0.062) in the period prior to the lockdown. During the first lockdown period the average tempo is 0.140 with standard deviation 0.044 however in lockdown 2 it is 0.070 with standard deviation 0.012, thus it is clear that both average and standard deviation are decreasing. Table 4 represents the results of ANOVA testing for mean of t r during various lockdown periods which is significant means that the average tempo of COVID-19 is significantly different is various periods considered. A group wise comparison of the average tempo of COVID-19 t r during various lockdown periods is shown in Table 5 which reveal that lockdown is significantly affects the spread of COOVID-19. Figure 1 show that tempo of disease t r is declining towards zero with time, more rapidly in Kerala and",

Prediction of a disease may help us to understand the factors affecting it and the steps that we can take to control it. The Government of India has taken preventive measures such as complete lockdown in the very early stage of disease, physical distancing and case isolation. The most important issue is that many healthcare professionals are visiting each and every household in the hotspot area across the country to trace and isolate infected persons to curtail the spread of disease. In order to support the prevention of the disease and aid to the healthcare professionals, an attempt has been made to develop a simple model for the prediction of confirmed COVID-19 cases and to utilize that model for forecasting future COVID-19 cases in India. As per the model forecast, the confirmed cases are expected to gradually decrease in the coming weeks. It is also likely that the efforts such as lockdown and physical distancing affect this prediction start to decline. On the basis of considered data, one can predict that the final size of corona virus pandemic in India will be around 350000 by the end of August. The exponential model used in this study is a data driven model. Thus, its forecasts are as reliable and can capture the dynamics of the pandemic. Due to real time change in data daily, the predictions will accordingly change.",
