Over time, however, as wild populations declined and source country attitudes toward these faunal treasures changed, animals used in research were more often bred in captivity. Standard operating procedures, sanitation, and lack of intermediate hosts greatly reduced the incidence of parasite infection and infestation, particularly for indirectly transmitted parasites [1]. Now, except for a few directly transmitted parasites, infection and infestation are uncommon. However, the occasional movement of animals from the wild into captive populations, particularly in zoological collections, means that veterinarians and biologists working with NHP, including marmosets, should remain aware of these organisms and the conditions caused by them.",

The presence of this organelle facilitates identification of the genus. Trophozoites are piriform and bilaterally symmetrical, measure 9\u201321 \u03bcm long by 5\u201315 \u03bcm wide, and bear a sucking disc on the anteroventral side (\nFig. 17.1A\n). The dorsal side is convex. There are two anterior nuclei, two slender axostyles, and four pairs of flagella. The infectious cyst stage is oval in shape. Cysts typically measure 8\u201312 \u03bcm long and 7\u201310 \u03bcm wide [5] (Fig. 17.1B). Following binary fission, cysts contain two daughter trophozoites, thereby doubling the number of internal organelles [2], [6].",

Infection is common in South and Central America. Because of the presence of suitable arthropod vectors in the extreme southern United States, T. cruzi has become established in some captive nonhuman primate colonies in Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia. Several species of wild animals serve as reservoirs of the parasite, making eradication of infection difficult once established in a nonhuman primate colony [16], [16a].",

New World monkeys, including marmosets, are less commonly infected with E. histolytica than are Old World monkeys. However, when infected, clinical disease is generally worse than in Old World monkeys. Other factors influencing severity of disease include the age and nutritional status of the host, with younger animals being more severely affected. In addition, environmental conditions that increase host animal stress and the intestinal microbiota of the host may play a role in disease severity [6], [16], [22].",

As with other hosts, infestation of marmosets with Sarcoptes scabiei may cause severe clinical signs, including intense pruritus, anorexia, weakness, and emaciation [2]. It is likely that those individuals capable of mounting a more robust type I hypersensitivity reaction would show the worst signs and harbor the fewest mites, though this has not been reported. In contrast, clinical signs of infestation with nonburrowing species are uncommon. Tick infestations are usually asymptomatic in marmosets and are unlikely to be of concern in captive colonies [2].",
