            "text": "Compilation of DNA primary sequence data continues unabated and tends to overwhelm us with voluminous outputs that increase daily. Comparison of primary sequences of different DNA strands remains one of the important aspect of the analysis of DNA data banks. Mathematical analysis of the large volume genomic DNA sequence data is one of the challenges for bio-scientists. There are three class methods for the analysis of DNA sequences: (i) Alignment [1], [2]. (ii) Matrices: (1) matrices in which an individual entry corresponds to an individual pair of bases [3], [6], [7] and (2) matrices in which entries summarize information of different X\u2013Y pairs of bases [4], [5], [7]. (iii) Graphical representation: Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures. Graphical techniques have emerged as a very powerful tool for the visualization and analysis of long DNA sequences. These techniques provide useful insights into local and global characteristics and the occurrences, variations and repetition of the nucleotides along a sequence which are not as easily obtainable by other methods. In recent years several authors outlined different graphical representation of DNA sequences based on 2D, 3D or 4D [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Based on these graphical representation, several authors outlined some approaches to make comparison of DNA sequences [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].",

We will change to consider the fully overlapping triplets of nucleotide bases. Consideration of triplets of nucleotide bases instead of individual nucleotide bases has several reasons and advantages. There are three of them: (i) The genetic code consists of triplets (codons) of DNA (or RNA in some virus) nucleotides. (ii) The second advantage is that one can easily find the open reading frame as the longest sequence of triplets that contains no stop codons when read in a single reading frame. (iii) The computation will become more simple.",
