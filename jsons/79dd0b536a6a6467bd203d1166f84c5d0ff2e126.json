            "text": "Motivation: This study focuses on supervised prediction of aging-related genes from -omics data. Unlike gene expression methods that capture aging-specific information but study genes in isolation, or protein-protein interaction (PPI) network methods that account for PPIs but the PPIs are contextunspecific, we recently integrated the two data types into an aging-specific PPI subnetwork, which yielded more accurate aging-related gene predictions. However, a dynamic aging-specific subnetwork did improve prediction performance compared to a static aging-specific subnetwork, despite the aging process being dynamic. Results: So, here, we propose computational advances towards improving prediction accuracy from a dynamic aging-specific subnetwork. We develop a supervised learning model that when applied to a dynamic subnetwork yields extremely high prediction performance, with F-score of 91.4%, while the best model on any static subnetwork yields F-score of \"only\" 74.3%. Hence, our predictive model could guide with high confidence the discovery of novel aging-related gene candidates for future wet lab validation.",

            "text": "This unexpected finding could be because the dynamic subnetwork was inferred using the induced approach, which is quite naive. Recently, an alternative, methodologically more advanced notion of network propagation (NP) was used for inference of a static context-specific subnetwork in the context of cancer [19] , with prominent NP approaches being NetWalk [20] and HotNet2 [21] . NP maps expression levels (i.e., activities) onto the genes in the entire contextunspecific PPI network. Then, NP propagates the activities via random walks or diffusion, to assign condition-specific weights to the nodes (genes, i.e., their protein products) or edges (PPIs) in the entire network. Finally, NP assumes that it is the highest-weighted network regions that are the most relevant for the condition of interest, i.e., that such regions form the context-specific subnetwork. For information on methodological differences between NetWalk and HotNet2, please refer to their original publications or to work by Newaz et al. [22] .",

Because not all human genes have sequence orthologs in model species [24, 25] , using GenAge may miss aspects of the aging process that are unique to human [26] . So, we consider another source of aging-related knowledge obtained by studying human directly (rather than doing so indirectly from model species), namely the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) project [8] . Second, the above results are when using the induced and NP subnetworks inferred from a particular context-unspecific PPI network [27] . We also consider induced and NP subnetworks inferred from another context-unspecific PPI network [28, 29] .

On the other hand, with an assumption that not all PPIs between the active genes might be equally important, NP's weighting mechanism allows it to select only highest-weighted of all PPIs between the active genes.

            "text": "Newaz et al. [22] extended two prominent NP approaches originally proposed for inference of a static condition-specific subnetwork in the context of cancer, NetWalk and HotNet2, to the problem of inferring a dynamic context-specific subnetwork in the context of aging. They evaluated the subnetworks produced by NetWalk against those produced by HotNet2, and found the former to be better, i.e., to overlap more with aging-related ground truth data. Consequently, in this paper, we only focus on the dynamic aging-specific subnetworks inferred using NetWalk. For this NP approach, Newaz et al. [22] considered two versions, referred to as NetWalk and NetWalk*. Their key difference is which gene expression levels (i.e., activity scores) they assign to which genes prior to propagating the gene activities through the network. Intuitively, the former assigns actual expression levels to only those genes that are significantly expressed (active) at a given age and \"non-informative\" (i.e., \"dummy\") expression levels to all other genes in the entire network, while the latter assigns actual expression levels to both active and non-active genes; for more information, see [22] . Multiple dynamic aging-specific subnetworks were produced by each of NetWalk and NetWalk*. Here, for each of HPRD and HINT+HI2, we select the best of all NetWalk dynamic subnetworks, and the best of all NetWalk* dynamic subnetworks; by \"best\", we mean the subnetwork that overlapped the most with the aging-related ground truth data according to the analysis by Newaz et al. [22] or that has resulted in the best prediction accuracy in our evaluation from this paper. Specifically, our selected NetWalk dynamic subnetwork based on HPRD was referred to as NetWalk-2 in the original publication [22] ; our selected NetWalk* dynamic subnetwork based on HPRD was referred to as NetWalk*; our selected NetWalk dynamic subnetwork based on HINT+HI2 was referred to as NetWalk; and our selected NetWalk* dynamic subnetwork based on HINT+HI2 was referred to as NetWalk*-2.",

This way, we directly infer a static subnetwork, rather than doing so indirectly by first inferring a dynamic and only then a compressed subnetwork. For Induced, this procedure yields a static subnetwork that is the same as its compressed counterpart. For each of NetWalk and NetWalk*, nodes or edges could differ between its compressed subnetwork and its static subnetwork. For these two approaches, after the aggregated gene expression data is propagated over the entire context-unspecific network and weights are assigned to all edges in the entire network, we choose the edge weight threshold that results in the static subnetwork matching the number of edges in its compressed counterpart as closely as possible.

However, human genes in GenAge are sequence orthologs of aging-related genes in model organisms, but human aging is a complex process that has unique biological aspects compared to the aging process in a model species [26] . So, to hopefully capture the human-unique aspects, we separately consider a secondary label definition with respect to GTEx, which was obtained by studying aging directly in human.

Indeed, we find that the hypothesis holds. That is, the best of the dynamic subnetworks (NetWalk*-Dynamic) outperforms all static subnetworks in terms of all of AUPR, precision, recall, and F-score (Fig. 1 ). Its superiority is not statistically significant, which is at least partly due to the prediction accuracy of all subnetworks being relatively high (i.e., the lowest AUPR over all nine subnetworks is 67.9%, the lowest precision is 68.8%, the lowest recall is 53.5%, and the lowest F-score is 61.8%). Also, this could partly be due to the fact that we compute the significance of the difference between subnetworks (i.e., their predictive models) via the Wilcoxon test applied to the models' five accuracy scores (corresponding to the five folds of cross-validation). However, it is well known that comparing such small samples via the Wilcoxon test tends to decrease (though not invalidate) the power of the test. Importantly, the best predictive model yields extremely high accuracy when predicting aging-related genes. Namely, for NetWalk*-Dynamic, AUPR is 95.6%, precision is 93.8%, recall is 89.2%, and F-score is 91.4%.

NP is expected to produce such a subnetwork, given that unlike Induced, it can remove low-weight PPIs between active genes (because such PPIs are hypothesized to be less important for the condition of interest, in our case, the aging process) or add to its subnetwork non-active genes that critically connect the active genes in the entire PPI network (along with their PPIs). Note that by removing PPIs between active genes, if all of the PPIs that a gene is incident to are removed, such a gene would become isolated and would thus removed from the subnetwork.

This further stresses out the power of NP. Figure 2 : Overlaps of all genes (black numbers) and genes labeled as aging-related (red numbers) between Induced, NetWalk, and NetWalk* subnetworks that are inferred from HPRD. To be precise, for each circle (e.g., NetWalk), the pink number (e.g., 1,555 for NetWalk) corresponds to the size of the node intersection of all three corresponding HPRD-based subnetworks (e.g., NetWalk-Dynamic, NetWalk-Compressed, and NetWalk-Static for NetWalk). So, the overlaps are between (i) the intersection of the three Induced subnetworks, (ii) the intersection of the three NetWalk subnetworks, and (iii) the intersection of the three NetWalk* subnetworks. Labeling only the 84 genes from the very center that are in all subnetworks and in GenAge as aging-related (and labeling the 315 genes that are in all subnetworks but not in any of the six ground truth data sets as non-aging-related) for classification allows for a fair comparison of prediction accuracy over all subnetworks.",

We already showed that for the three Induced subnetworks, prediction accuracy is not nearly as good under the GTEx-DAG-based gene labels as it is under the GenAge-based gene labels [18] . Here, we confirm that the same holds for the six NP (NetWalk and NetWalk*) subnetworks.

Nonetheless, even for the former, all subnetworks perform much worse when using the GTEx-DAG-based labels ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ) than when using the GenAge-based ones (Supplementary Figs. S3-S5). Again, all nine subnetworks are statistically significantly more accurate than the random approach (adjusted p-values below 0.04) in terms of precision, recall, and F-score, although not in terms of AUPR. However, unlike in all of the above analyses, now it is a static subnetwork, NetWalk-Static, that is (marginally) superior to all other subnetworks, including the dynamic ones. This subnetwork is NP-based, which again justifies a need for NP.",

First, genes in GTEx-DAG have been linked to aging directly in human, while those in GenAge have been linked to aging indirectly based on their sequence similarities to aging-related genes in model species. So, GTEx-DAG should better capture aspects of the aging process that are unique to human. Given this, and given that we have aimed to extract human aging-related knowledge from human PPI subnetworks, one would expect GTEx-DAG to perform better. However, it does not. This could be because GenAge may be more accurate than GTEx-DAG. Second, the considered subnetworks have been formed by integrating gene expression data with PPI data. Given that GTEx-DAG is also gene expression-based, while GenAge is sequence-based, one would expect GTEx-DAG to perform better. However, it does not. This could be because GTEx and GenAge are highly complementary (only 14 genes are labeled as aging-related in both), and because our predictive models may be better suited for the aging-related knowledge present in GenAge.",
