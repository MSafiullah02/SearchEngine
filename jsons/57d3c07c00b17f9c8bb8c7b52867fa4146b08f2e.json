To identify the causal origins of a spread, it is often necessary to identify the triggering initial node. Here, we define a new morphological operator and use it to detect the origin of a diffusive front, given the final state of a complex network. Our method performs better than algorithms based on distance (closeness) and Jordan centrality. More importantly, our method is applicable regardless of the specifics of the forward model, and therefore can be applied to a wide range of systems such as identifying the patient zero in an epidemic, pinpointing the neuron that triggers a cascade, identifying the original malfunction that causes a catastrophic infrastructure failure, and inferring the ancestral species from which a heterogeneous population evolves.",

A morphological operator modifies every point in a set (e.g., an image) according to the spatial arrangement of neighboring points. A stencil, called the \"structuring element,\" with a predefined shape is placed on individual points, and if the surroundings of the point match (or not match) the shape of the stencil, then the point is modified. One particular operator, erosion, is important for our purpose. Erosion deletes all points whose surroundings mismatch the structuring element. Since a mismatch would typically happen near the boundaries of a shape, the erosion filter ends up rounding up and thinning down all shapes. This is the qualitative behavior we need in order get rid of the peripheral nodes of C and reach its core.",

The difference in success is maximal when the number of affected nodes become maximum, at \u03bb \u2192 1. Across all forward models, we have the least success when the spread probability \u03bb \u223c 0.5, the regime with the highest number of possible states due to the high variability in the stochastic process. This variability causes the calculated average stencil to very rarely match a given diffusion state.",

This matrix must be embedded into the scoring metric such that mismatches in state are weighted by the elements of this matrix.

[13] uses a Jaccard similarity function to characterize the similarity between simulated spreads versus a given spread. This is then used to estimate the probability of a spread given a source via a Gaussian weighting and therefore we will refer to this method as the Jaccard-Gaussian algorithm. This method compares two network states, i.e., two binary vectors (nodes are either infected or susceptible) as obtained by Monte Carlo simulations versus a given final state. To compare two microstates of networks, Ref. [13] 3 . Probability that the true seed is a high-ranked node for all models and dynamics using \u03bb = 0.6 (p 0 = 0.6) T = 5 (lower rank is better). The protein interaction network (n = 3744,m = 7749), power grid network (n = 4941,m = 6594), and scale-free network (n = 4941,m = 6601) are shown in each column. The four dynamic models are shown in each row. The protein and scale-free networks have larger spreads than the grid network and therefore will have a larger distribution for the rank sizes. Our method (solid lines) generally outperforms the two centrality methods based on a total of 500 runs. Note that Jordan centrality provides much better performance than distance (closeness) centrality. The error bars represent \u00b1 one expected standard deviation for an average of 100 runs. a spread from every single candidate node. In contrast, we work with a single probability distribution defined over the network. Since the space of all possible N-node states (which Ref. [13] samples) is astronomically larger than the space of single node states (which we sample), we can leverage this gain in computational cost to sample our space more accurately. Our approach has another advantage: A forward model uniquely determines a stencil, and once we have our stencils for a certain model, we can use it for multiple C sets, say, for different realizations of the same disease.

Overall, the Jaccard-Gaussian method has better performance when \u03bb < 0.5, after which our method is better. In all cases, both methods were limited to using the same set of 134 simulated runs (stencil), where each data point was generated from independent test sets of 500 runs. However, only runs which satisfies the Jaccard-Gaussian convergence condition [Eq. (3)] were used in these plots. (b) How often a highly ranked node is the true seed (\u03bb = 0.7, T = 5). Both methods used the same set (stencil) of 667 simulated runs for their algorithms. The spectrum is generated from testing the performance of each method for 500 runs. Additionally, the error bars were generated by randomly selecting 100 runs and calculating the deviation from average across all runs. Therefore, the error bars represent the expected standard deviation for a sample size of 100 runs.",

By studying the specific dynamics, one can generate additional constraints and properties of the dynamics such as tree topology, exact analytical solutions, conservation laws, etc., that might aid in inversion [17, 19] . Furthermore, the performance of our algorithm can be enhanced by extending what we have done with two-body correlations to n-body correlations or time-dependent correlations to calculate path integrals based on Bayesian inference (e.g., Ref. [12] for one specific model). However, generalizing such approaches for any forward model and any network topology is offset by the huge number of simulations required to resolve the correlations to within a useful error margin and will be very costly.
