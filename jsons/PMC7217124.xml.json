Laboratories revealed worsening lymphopenia (370 cells/\u00b5L) and elevated C-reactive protein (415 mg/L). Repeat PCR for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. He worsened rapidly requiring endotracheal intubation, lung-protective ventilation, inhaled epoprostenol, pronation within 12 hours, and escalation in fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO2) to 80% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 14 cm H2O. At the time of pronation, his partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2):FiO2 ratio was 104. He did not require paralysis. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. He was continued on azithromycin and ceftriaxone and treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily. He developed worsening PaO2:FiO2 (nadir 84), acute kidney injury, and abrupt onset hypotension that required dobutamine 5 \u00b5g/kg/min and norepinephrine 15 \u00b5g/min. He stabilized hemodynamically and LVEF on dobutamine 2.5 \u00b5g/kg/min was 50%. Creatine kinase increased from 312 to 1,582 units/L. Troponin was negative. Interleukin (IL)-6 was severely elevated (2,436.7 pg/ml, resulted hospital day 14). Based on the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization guidelines (www.elso.com), he met indication for VV-ECMO: hypoxemic respiratory failure with 80% mortality risk as predicted by PaO2:FiO2 <100 despite optimal care, and was transferred on hospital day 4 (ECMO day 0). On arrival, vasoactive medications included dobutamine 2.5 \u00b5g/kg/min, norepinephrine 6 \u00b5g/min, and epoprostenol 50 ng/kg/min, with pulse 105 bpm, arterial blood pressure 125/46 mm Hg, oxygen saturation 90% on 100% FiO2 with tidal volume 6 ml/kg, and PEEP 16 cm H2O.

C-reactive protein expression is induced by IL-6, is increased in CRS, and may be clinically relevant as a marker of IL-6 activity.5 Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is FDA approved and used in the management of CAR T-cell\u2013related CRS.5 Based on partial clinical and biologic overlap with CRS, there is biologic plausibility to administer tocilizumab in severe and critical illness due to COVID-19. In support of this, 19 of 21 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients in China treated with tocilizumab survived to discharge and >80% had improved fever, supplemental oxygenation needs, or inflammatory markers (preprint: Xu et al., ChinaXiv 2020).",

In clinical trials, grade 4 CRS is reversible in all patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (maximum dose 800 mg) every 8 hours, maximum 3 doses in 24 hours.6 Given the critical illness in our patient, we used this dosing regimen. After administration of tocilizumab, our patient had a rapid and sustained decrease in C-reactive protein (Figure 1). This demonstrates that tocilizumab given while on VV-ECMO is effective at blocking IL-6 signaling. The progressive improvement in oxygenation and decannulation from ECMO suggests blocking excessive IL-6 activity facilitates recovery from COVID-19 respiratory failure.",
