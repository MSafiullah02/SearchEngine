Passive cell death is the direct, acute killing of a cell by an exterior aggression damaging enough to produce irreversible alterations; these occur without the participation of the cell and can be prevented only by the absence of the aggression. This is the case, among others, of cell death due to exposure to high concentrations of detergents or antiseptics, extreme heat or repeated freeze-thawing, that is, situations without biological relevance. In this mode of cell death there is immediate, extensive and irreparable damage to the cytoplasmic membrane and this damage affects the membrane from without.",

The term \u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d, coined by Lockshin and Williams to qualify developmental cell death [1], has gained wide use to characterize active cell deaths. However, the term \u201cprogrammed\u201d has been used in two distinct senses to characterize either (i) cell death processes that occur at a precise local and time according to a developmental program (for example in morphogenesis) or (ii) cell deaths that, once triggered (as part of a developmental program or occasionally as in some pathologies), follow cell-intrinsic biochemical programs controlled by the doomed cell. Therefore, we will use the term \u201cactive\u201d instead of \u201cprogrammed\u201d when referring to cell death processes that, once triggered, unroll following a course of biochemical events processed and controlled by the dying cell.",

The initial report by Kerr, Wyllie and Currie, introducing the concept of apoptosis [2] was based on in vivo observations in mammalian tissues and described that process as comprising a terminal cell elimination stage through the removal of the apoptosing cell by phagocytosis and degradation by a scavenger cell. However, it was soon recognized by Kerr and collaborators that in vivo [3, 4] and in vitro [5, 6], when removal by scavengers does not occur, the apoptotic process continues until a transition to necrosis ensues leading to cell elimination by cell disruption. This terminal disruption of apoptotic cells was initially called \u201csecondary degeneration\u201d [5], a designation later changed to \u201csecondary necrosis\u201d [7]. This designation achieved widespread acceptance and is now part of the glossary of cell death terms, although it is prone to some confusion. Indeed, necroses that can be also labeled as secondary can occur in diverse situations; for example, necrosis following ischemia due to vascular occlusion has been frequently called secondary necrosis, as in necrotizing fasciitis.",

The presently known clear-cut forms of active cell death include, besides apoptosis, autophagic cell death [10, 15], primary necrosis (also known as programmed necrosis) [11, 16\u201318], mitotic catastrophe [19], and caspase 1-dependent pyroptosis [20].

In the first phase, molecular alterations produce the classical apoptotic morphotype (see Table 1 and Figs. 1b, 2b and 4) that is used to identify this mode of cell death. During this phase the apoptosing cells may or may not fragment into apoptotic bodies, and, in contrast with necrosis, the membrane enveloping the apoptosing cells or the apoptotic bodies remains near-to-intact, that is, except for some structural alterations like externalization of phosphatidylserine and exposition of other \u201ceat-me\u201d signals for phagocytosis by scavengers, it is normal including in regards to selective permeability [7, 33, 34]. The terminal phase is secondary necrosis during which necrotic molecular alterations produce a new morphotype (see Table 1) which is more typical when there is no fragmentation into apoptotic bodies; this secondary necrotic morphotype is a mixture of alterations produced in the apoptotic phase (like nuclear fragmentation and intense chromatin condensation) and necrotic alterations (swelling of the cell and damage to the cytoplasmic membrane) [7]. Ultimately the cytoplasmic membrane ruptures and the cell (or the apoptotic bodies) is dismantled to cell debris (Fig. 1c, d). This experiment shows that the apoptotic death of an isolated cell, once triggered, is self-sufficient and leads to self-elimination by secondary necrosis.\n\n\n\n",

This process of cell elimination, described in the initial report by Kerr, Wyllie and Currie as the second stage of apoptosis in mammals and as the physiological mechanism for elimination of apoptosing cells or apoptotic bodies [2] is activated in the in vitro setting but cannot operate because of the lack of the scavenger.",

[25, 36, 37]. There is proteolytic degradation of many substrates mainly effected by activated effector caspases [36] but caspase-independent effector mechanisms may also participate [38], and may have the participation of autophagy [39]. The degradative events occurring during the execution of apoptosis produce a partial cell dismantling which confers to apoptosis an autolytic character and is the basis of the apoptotic morphotype. This initial autolytic degradation is significantly increased when apoptosing cells are phagocytosed and heterolytically digested by scavengers or when apoptosis transits to secondary necrosis where further, extensive, autolytic degradation leads to cell disruption.",

The non-fragmented, shrunken, apoptosing cell can be considered a single apoptotic body [45], as in the case of the so-called sunburn cells, apoptotic keratinocytes induced by UV irradiation of the skin [46]. Apoptotic bodies are produced while the apoptosing cell still has a near-to-normal cytoplasmic membrane and they are as well enveloped by a near-to-intact membrane [2, 47]. Like apoptosing cells, they express signals for engulfment and are phagocytosed by scavengers [2] or undergo secondary necrosis if not engulfed [7, 47].",

In higher multicellular animals, phagocytosis is mainly accomplished by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, the professional phagocytes [50], which constitute up to 10\u201315% of cells in most mammalian tissues [23]. Typically, the professional scavenger of dying/dead cells is the macrophage [51, 52], which is located in all body territories and is highly phagocytic [53]. When macrophages are not available, for example due to a particular location of the dying/dead cells, neutrophils [54], or neighbor cells functioning as surrogate \u201camateur\u201d phagocytes, may fulfill the role of removal of dying/dead cells; most cell types, including dendritic, epithelial, endothelial, and glomerular mesangial cells, fibroblasts, myocytes, and tumor cells, are able to perform this task [7, 49, 51, 52, 55]. This situation is the rule in simple multicellular animals, like Caenorhabditis elegans, where professional phagocytes are not present and apoptosing cells are removed by neighbor cells [56].",

Encounter of apoptosing cells with phagocytes may require attraction of phagocytes; specific attraction signals released by apoptosing cells in a caspase 3-dependent manner have been described [65, 66]. The recognition and engulfment of dying/dead cells by phagocytes involves the interaction between a number of molecules (reviewed in Refs. [67\u201370]). \u201cEat me\u201d signals are exposed on the surface of apoptosing cells and are recognized by receptors on the surface of scavengers. The interactions between the engulfment signals and the receptors are facilitated by bridging molecules present in serum such as \u03b22 glycoprotein, milk fat globule protein (MFG-E8), protein S, growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), thrombospondin, pentraxins and complement factors. This mechanism of attraction between apoptosing cells and scavengers is complemented by the loss by the apoptosing cells of expression of \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals that normally prevent engulfment of living cells.",

In this context, it is of note that many studies on this topic (and on the immunological effects of necrotic cells) used cells made necrotic by physical methods like heating, or exposure to detergents or fixatives. These methods produce passive necrotic cells with protein inactivation that consequently cannot be representative of cells dying in vivo due to active necrotic processes which induce proteolytic alterations and exposure of engulfment signals. It is therefore important that more studies be conducted on the process of recognition of necrosing cells by scavengers and on the pathogenic effects of necrosis using cells under active necrosis.",

This heterolytic degradation superimposes on the autolysis ongoing in the apoptosing cell [2, 4]. Several results indicate that the role of macrophages in removal of apoptosing cells is not solely to eliminate cell corpses, but rather to degrade those cells to harmless and largely re-utilizable molecules; this dismantling can be extensive when the dying/dead cells are engulfed very early in the apoptotic process [71, 72]. Indeed, uptake of apoptosing cells can occur with different timings after death triggering, depending on the timing of exposition of surface engulfment signals and on the availability of scavengers. Therefore, the extension of the executed apoptotic curriculum can vary, manifesting different morphologies. Apoptosing cells can be engulfed so early that the typical morphological changes or DNA fragmentation have not yet occurred [73\u201375] which would explain why under physiological conditions cells with apoptotic indicators are rarely seen in tissues [7, 76]. The swift removal of apoptosing cells is particularly advantageous in embryogenesis.",

            "text": "Although the macrophage response to the phagocytosis of apoptosing cells may occasionally be pro-inflammatory (see discussion in Refs. [14, 52, 68], that phagocytosis typically fails to induce an inflammatory response [81] due to active inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and to generation of anti-inflammatory factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids [82\u201384]. This contrasts with the effect of necrotic cell engulfment, which usually, but not always [77, 85], induces pro-inflammatory responses by the engulfing phagocytes [68, 69, 86, 87]. The prevailing view is that the delayed and deficient removal mechanism of cells under primary necrosis allows the persistence of leaky cells and necrotic debris which leads to activation of pro-inflammatory and immuno-stimulatory responses [11, 16] (see \u201cPathogenic consequences of apoptotic secondary necrosis\u201d section). Necrotic cells may induce an inflammatory response not only by spilling their contents after lysis, but also by actively secreting inflammatory molecules, including cytokines (reviewed in Ref. [68]). However, there are reports of occurrence of extensive necrotic processes in vivo in the absence of important inflammatory responses [79, 80, 85, 88]. It is also of note that necrosis-associated inflammation, when not excessive, can be beneficial for the organism, for example during a protective immune response [17]. The removal by phagocytosis of cells under secondary necrosis will be discussed in \u201cPathogenic consequences of apoptotic secondary necrosis\u201d section.",

            "text": "Recent advances in the knowledge of signaling and biochemical events in active primary necrosis are reviewed in Refs. [11, 17, 18, 91, 92]. During the degradation phase of active necrosis several biochemical alterations have been described including mitochondrial dysfunction, high production of ROS, serious ATP depletion, intense ionic imbalance, and activation of non-caspase proteases; these alterations ultimately converge in extensive lysosome rupture, which assumes a decisive role in active necrosis [93]. ATP depletion, ROS production and Ca2+ fluxes involve complex feedback and feed-forward interactive loops, some of them self-amplifying, as comprehensively reviewed by Brookes [94]. The important Ca2+ overload [95\u201397] induces enhanced activation of hydrolysing enzymes, including calpains [98], and leads to exaggerated energy consumption and impairment of energy production [99]; ATP depletion and activated calpains were shown to induce lysosome rupture [93, 100, 101], and released lysosomal cathepsins contribute to cytoplasmic membrane damage [102, 103], a hallmark of necrosis [7]. Thus, contrary to what happens in passive necrosis, cytoplasmic membrane damage in active necrosis is produced from within. This damage is due to the cumulative activity of hydrolytic enzymes and of ROS, and to serious energy failure; these events result in progressive membrane permeabilization to molecules of increasing size until the rupture of the membrane. This rupture is a consequence of the continuous cell swelling (oncosis or necrotic volume increase [104]) due to the maintenance within the cell of large molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids (Gibbs\u2013Donnan effect [105\u2013108]). Thus, the progressive deterioration of the cytoplasmic membrane of necrosing cells leads to initial leakage of small ions like K+, then leakage of small macromolecules and finally leakage of large macromolecules [105].",

As discussed, the development of apoptosis requires energy. When apoptosis progresses without engulfment of apoptosing cells, the progression eventually leads to a late depletion of the intracellular ATP pool [109\u2013111] likely due to early ATP-consuming apoptotic reactions together with a late complete loss of mitochondrial function [109]. This endogenously originated late serious energy depletion has been considered the trigger for the transition from the end of a fully developed execution phase of apoptosis to secondary necrosis [21, 101, 112, 113]. It is known that serious ATP depletion provoked during early apoptosis induces a switch to necrosis (see below).",

While the results from Nicotera\u2019s group suggest inactivation leading to a decreased rate of Ca2+ efflux from the cells and consequent cytosolic Ca2+ overload [116], the results form Enyedi\u2019s group suggest that the cleavage product remains functionally active and would not contribute to Ca2+ overload [117\u2013119]. An intense rise in intracellular Ca2+ was observed prior to the transition of apoptosis to secondary necrosis in prostate and bladder cancer cell lines [120], human B cell line FMO [121] or chicken B-lymphocytes [115]. In two of these studies [115, 121], the dramatic Ca2+ cytosolic overload was considered to be involved in that transition.",

When apoptosing cells enter the secondary necrosis process those two assays change from negative to positive [33, 125, 126], revealing the ensuing of cytoplasmic membrane damage. Like in primary necrosis, in secondary necrosis PI-positivity precedes release of LDH and of other large molecules like activated caspase 3 (about 19 kD) (see Figs. 1D and 3C in Ref. [126]). As will be discussed in \u201cPathogenic consequences of apoptotic secondary necrosis\u201d section, these observations are relevant in the context of the potential pathogenic role of secondary necrotic cells, since it is likely that only ruptured secondary necrotic cells will release large molecules like DNA, RNA and proteins including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein (about 30 kD) with inflammatory and immunogenic capacities.",

This switch occurs earlier than the spontaneous transition to secondary necrosis triggered by the endogenous failure of ATP associated with the complete progression of the apoptotic process. Indeed, the switch induced by ATP depletion from without interrupts the normal progression of apoptosis preventing the occurrence of biochemical events, like caspase activation, that produce the typical apoptotic morphotype. Consequently, cells under necrosis due to the switch apoptosis\u2013necrosis do not exhibit the mixed secondary necrotic morphotype previously discussed (see Table 1 and Figs. 1c, 2c and 4) but rather that of active primary necrosis. This \u201cswitched necrosis\u201d does not comply with the classical definition of apoptotic secondary necrosis discussed in the beginning of this review. However, it may lead to similar pathological consequences since the cells undergoing this switched necrosis autolyse and release cytotoxic or immunogenic molecules.\n\n",

The frequent lack of consideration of the fact that induction of apoptosis in vitro (usually in the absence of scavengers) inevitably results in secondary necrosis can lead to misleading interpretations of induction of active primary necrosis, or of a switch from apoptosis to necrosis, when the actual event was the natural transition of an ongoing apoptosis to secondary necrosis. Confusion between the occurrence of active primary or secondary necrosis in vitro is particularly frequent when no kinetic studies are carried out, preventing the observation of apoptosis preceding secondary necrosis. The same problem arises when studying apoptosis of unicellular eukaryotic cells like yeasts because also in this case apoptosis is always followed by secondary necrosis [8, 9].",

As already discussed, before they are cleared by scavengers or enter secondary necrosis, apoptotic cells exclude membrane impermeant stains like PI [33] (it is of note that the exclusion of membrane impermeant stains is only observed when these stains are used in low concentrations and for short periods [135] as in the protocol in reference [136]). PI positivity in secondary necrotic cells can be detected after combined vital staining with Hoechst 33342/PI (see Fig. 4 and Ref. [134]). Also typical of apoptotic secondary necrotic cells is the association of nuclear apoptotic alterations and cytoplasmic membrane rupture detected by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2c), depicting the terminal stage of secondary necrosis. Particularly informative is the time-lapse observation by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy of Hoechst 33342/PI stained preparations [134]. This continuous scrutiny of the same cell allows the observation of the apoptotic morphotype (with apoptotic nuclear alterations, cell shrinkage, blebbing, and production of apoptotic bodies (when it occurs) and PI-negativity) followed by entrance into the secondary necrotic process as indicated by the change to PI-positivity, followed by cell swelling with reduction in cytoplasm density (Fig. 4), chromatolysis, and finally cell burst.",

As discussed in \u201cApoptosis as the prelude of secondary necrosis\u201d section, when macrophages fail to clear apoptosing cells, a second route can operate for the uptake using dendritic cells. Macrophages completely degrade ingested cells without antigen presentation, but when that uptake is by dendritic cells, these present antigens and activate the immune system, which may lead to autoimmunity [57, 58, 60, 146]. Phagosomes containing phagocytosed cells mature more rapidly in macrophage than in dendritic cells; in these cells, low levels of lysosomal proteases and a decreased ability to degrade internalized protein favors their ability to present antigen [69, 147].",

            "text": "Removal by scavengers of apoptotic secondary necrotic cells in vivo does not usually occur because those cells typically originate due to lack of functional scavengers or of molecules involved in the removal process. If engulfment does occur, for example because secondary necrosis resulted from delayed instead of absent clearance, or because dendritic cells replace the lacking macrophages as scavengers, the engulfment affects cells with damaged cytoplasmic membranes or even ruptured cells and involves mechanisms that would be similar to those operating with cells under active primary necrosis. It has been suggested that efficient removal of apoptosing cells versus deficient removal of primary or secondary necrosing cells depends on the presence of an intact or a damaged cytoplasmic membrane, respectively [77]. When injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice, cells under apoptotic secondary necrosis were found to be phagocytosed by macrophages [148]. Removal of secondary necrotic cells co-cultured with macrophages in vitro was found to be less efficient and slower than removal of apoptosing cells [77]. It is thus likely that, in the in vivo situations, if engulfment of cells under apoptotic secondary necrosis occurs, it would be a deficient process as in the case of primary necrotic cells. Moreover, as discussed in \u201cApoptosis as the prelude of secondary necrosis\u201d section, phagocytosis of necrosing cells, in contrast to phagocytosis of apoptosing cells, usually results in pro-inflammatory and pro-immunogenic responses with potential to induce autoimmunity, as will be reviewed later.",

Release of toxic molecules like elastase, myeloperoxidase and HMGB1 protein from cells under secondary necrosis has been demonstrated [149\u2013154]. Although some reports suggest that phagocytosis by macrophages of secondary necrotic cells, like phagocytosis of early apoptosing cells, is not pro-inflammatory [59, 86, 87, 155], there are several publications showing that engulfment of secondary necrotic cells may be pro-inflammatory and immunogenic [60, 62, 129, 156\u2013160]. The discrepant results may be explained by the use of secondary necrotic cells at early (non-ruptured cytoplasmic membrane) or terminal (ruptured cytoplasmic membrane) phases and/or by the use of different types of engulfing cells (macrophages, dendritic cells or other cell types).",

Other possibility is when the scavenging capacity is directly impaired by intrinsic defects in the phagocytic function of scavengers or by extrinsic defects in signaling molecules involved in the engulfment process; in this case accumulation of apoptotic cells and transition to secondary necrosis may occur even in situations of normal levels of apoptosis. Observation of high numbers of apoptosing cells in tissues implies a deficiency in their removal [7, 161, 162] with the likely occurrence of secondary necrosis.

This interruption can be induced by impairment of energy metabolism [131\u2013133], by defects due to genetic alterations or by generation of inhibitors in injured areas [173], and, as already discussed, leads to a switch to necrosis. These non-cleared, necrosing cells undergo lysis that may have pathogenic implications [174] as in the case of apoptotic secondary necrosis. The switch apoptosis\u2013necrosis has been reported in several ischemic pathologies including in the brain [173\u2013175] and heart [170, 176]. ATP dependence of apoptosis and (almost) independence of active necrosis [37, 40, 177] might explain the frequent appearance of necrotic and apoptotic cells in pathological areas in vivo, such as the center of solid tumors and ischemic regions in solid organs; indeed, limitation of blood flow in those areas leads to ATP exhaustion due to insufficient oxygenation and reduced glycolysis by lack of glucose [178] and may result in the switch apoptosis\u2013necrosis.",

Neutrophils are very rich in inflammatory mediators and in proteases and oxidants which, if released in high amounts, can damage many types of cells, with the potential to produce tissue injury [182\u2013184]. Released neutrophil contents also induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which may amplify leukocyte infiltration and associated tissue injury [185, 186].

Mobilization of neutrophil cytoplasmic granules and secretory vesicles is regulated, minimizing the risk of externalization of excessive amounts of cytotoxic molecules [187]. Additionally, under physiological conditions, neutrophil cytotoxic proteases, including elastase, one of the most tissue destructive enzymes known [185], have their potentially dangerous activity tightly regulated by endogenous protease inhibitors [188]. Moreover, neutrophils have a short lifespan and are constitutively programmed to undergo apoptosis, which induces the exposure of engulfment signals and leads to their rapid recognition and removal by macrophages; this limits their pro-inflammatory and tissue injury potential and leads to resolution of inflammation with restitution of tissue homeostasis soon after the neutrophils have accomplished their task [76, 189, 190]. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a paradigm for complete resolution of inflammation without relevant subsequent lung injury indicating that, in some situations, extensive neutrophil accumulation can be adequately resolved [76]. Neutrophil apoptosis with timely removal of apoptosing neutrophils by lung macrophages was shown to be a mechanism for that resolution in a murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia [191]. However, this control of neutrophil activity and physiological resolution of inflammation by clearance of apoptotic neutrophils can fail and release of cytotoxic components by neutrophils accumulated at inflammatory foci can occur with the potential to produce collateral tissue damage; for instance, elimination of alveolar macrophages in the above model of pneumococcal pneumonia affected the clearance of accumulated neutrophils and resulted in extensive apoptotic secondary necrosis of neutrophils and in an exaggerated lung inflammation and increased lethality [191].",

This delay extends the time frame of neutrophil intervention but at the same time increases the chances of tissue injury. When accumulation of activated neutrophils at the inflammatory foci is massive, as is the case in several diseases, release of cytotoxic neutrophil molecules due to degranulation or lysis can be extensive [149, 150], overcoming the activity of the endogenous inhibitors [181, 188, 194]. Consequently, tissue injury ensues [195\u2013197]. Removal by scavengers of accumulated apoptosing neutrophils can be deficient leading to neutrophil secondary necrosis. This occurs when neutrophil accumulation is massive and disproportionate compared to the availability of scavengers or when neutrophil apoptosis is accelerated by microbial products [198, 199]. Impairment of scavenger macrophages by bacterial products [31] or by functional defects (see later) also causes excessive neutrophil secondary necrosis.",

Released proteinases overcome the activity of natural anti-proteases [194] and impair the anti-microbial activity of neutrophils [220]. Besides egression to the airway lumen [142, 143], an efficient mechanism for removal of neutrophils accumulated in the inflamed lung is through neutrophil apoptosis and removal by macrophages [76, 191]. Alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD are deficient in the capacity to engulf apoptotic cells [221], deficiency that is aggravated by smoking [222]. This clearance defect contributes to the accumulation of apoptotic cells in the lungs of COPD patients and in animal models of COPD [223], and the occurrence of pathogenic neutrophil apoptotic secondary necrosis associated with lung neutrophil accumulation has been considered in chronic lung inflammatory diseases including COPD and cystic fibrosis [186, 219, 220]. Secondary necrosis of neutrophils was also implicated in human [198, 199] and murine [224] lung infections by gram-negatives and in a mouse model of lung inflammation induced by nasal instillation of LPS [225, 226].",

            "text": "Acute fish pasteurellosis is a lethal septicemic infection due to Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp) and characterized by massive extracellular multiplication of the pathogen with extensive tissue necrosis [31]. One mechanism of the necrotic alterations typical of the advanced phase of this septicemia is systemic secondary necrosis of accumulated neutrophils and macrophages induced by an apoptogenic exotoxin (AIP56) secreted by virulent Phdp [30, 31]. The AIP56-induced fish phagocyte apoptosis involves activation of caspase 8, 9 and 3, and mitochondrial dysfunction with loss of \u0394\u03c8m and cytochrome c translocation to the cytosol [30, 31, 236] (C. Costa-Ramos et al. unpublished results). That the AIP56-induced phagocyte apoptosis proceeds to secondary necrosis and cytolysis is directly demonstrated by the occurrence of lysing phagocytes with apoptotic nuclear alterations in advanced infection (Fig. 2c; see also Fig. 3b, c in Ref. [32]). The simultaneous apoptotic destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by AIP56 leads to reduction in the number of available phagocytes that accumulated during the initial phase of the infection and efficient evasion of the pathogen from the host phagocytic defense; moreover, that destruction seriously decreases the host capacity to clear apoptosing cells. This phagocyte destruction has additional pathogenic consequences for the host: AIP56 exotoxin secreted by Phdp in infected fish is systemically distributed and induces disseminated phagocyte apoptosis that proceeds to secondary necrosis with extensive lysis of the phagocytes and release of cytotoxic molecules including neutrophil elastase [31]. Two concurrent mechanisms operate in the induction of the secondary necrotic outcome of the apoptotic process induced in phagocytes by AIP56: first, the exotoxin-induced phagocyte apoptosis is extensive leading to the production of great numbers of apoptosing leukocytes and, most importantly, it affects the principal scavenger cell, the macrophage, thus impairing the capacity to clear apoptosing cells by a self-amplifying process. This is an example of cell elimination adding more pathogenic consequences to those associated with the loss of function accompanying cell death. The \u201cclever\u201d nature of this pathogenicity mechanism is that it uses the intrinsic apoptotic machinery of the host cells, which is put at work by the pathogen to its own advantage.",

Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, including altered apoptosis [245]. Although autoimmunity may not follow impaired clearance of apoptosing cells [70, 246, 247], many studies show that such an impairment may result in immunogenicity and autoimmune disorders. There is a large body of evidence for the existence of a deficiency in clearance of apoptotic cells in autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), both in mouse models [61, 248] and in humans [58, 129, 244, 249\u2013253]. Several genetically modified mice with defective apoptotic cell clearance have been developed and most of them show signs of autoimmune disease [52, 159, 254\u2013256]. The defect in clearance of apoptosing cells in SLE and likely in other autoimmune disorders may have several mechanisms, including intrinsic impairment of engulfment capacity of phagocytes combined with extrinsic defects in bridging molecules involved in the recognition and engulfment of apoptosing cells by scavengers, like complement factors [61, 129, 253, 257, 258].",

This non-histone nuclear protein with a role in transcriptional regulation, functions as a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine when released in the extracellular space [261]. This protein is released during primary necrosis [262] and, contrary to initial reports, was found to be also released during secondary necrosis of several cell types [11, 151\u2013154] and has been considered to participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [151, 152]. HMGB1 is a protein of about 30 kD, and its release during secondary necrosis follows a kinetics similar to that of LDH release [152, 154], suggesting that progress of secondary necrosis until cell lysis is required for its externalization (see in \u201cApoptotic secondary necrosis\u201d section discussion on membrane damage in secondary necrosis).",

Serum levels of nucleosomes were found to be increased in various autoimmune diseases besides SLE [139]; the fact that blood caspase levels were increased together with nucleosomes in those diseases, favors the interpretation that apoptotic secondary necrosis is involved in the release of nucleosomes. Autoantigens in SLE patients are composed of or are intimately associated with RNA and DNA sequences that are endogenous ligands, respectively, for toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and/or TLR9 present in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes, contributing to autoimmune disease [159, 264, 265].

            "text": "Active suicidal death programs are intrinsic to cells in unicellular and multicellular organisms. Activation of these programs not only kills cells but additionally promotes mechanisms for elimination of the dying/dead cells. In multicellular animals, cells under apoptotic death can be eliminated by two processes with contrasting physiopathological consequences. One is the safe, physiological clearance by phagocytosis of the dying/dead cell or of apoptotic bodies through the timely assistance of a partner cell (the scavenger); this intervention of the scavenger removes the apoptosing cells or the apoptotic bodies while they still have a near-to-intact cytoplasmic membrane thus preventing leakage of dangerous molecules. However, this physiologically convenient mechanism is not self-sufficient because it depends on the participation of other cell and can be overridden in vivo when the scavenging mechanism fails. In this situation cell elimination is by transition of full-blown apoptosis to secondary necrosis that leads to cytoplasmic membrane damage and cell disintegration. This has potential pathogenic consequences and available data provides evidence suggesting that secondary necrosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases including autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, ischemia, and infection. The pathogenic consequences of extensive or persistent apoptotic secondary necrosis result from (i) the leakage of cytotoxic molecules (mainly when involving neutrophils) that induce tissue injury and pro-inflammatory responses; (ii) the uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells of secondary necrotic cell debris and released autoantigens, which may be pro-inflammatory and immunogenic. Apoptotic secondary necrosis may therefore produce acute and chronic pathology, thus being a mechanism for apoptosis turning pathogenic. It is important to recognize that cell disruption due to a necrotic process can be an outcome of apoptosis in vivo so that pathological consequences of this outcome may be inhibitable by anti-apoptotic interventions, prompting the use of (and research on) therapeutic interventions based on anti-apoptotic drugs. Contrasting with the available extensive studies on apoptosis and on the clearance of apoptosing cells by scavengers, the study of apoptotic secondary necrosis has been largely neglected and is much needed to better understand the full potential of this outcome of apoptosis in promotion of pathology.",

A central issue is that, in apoptosis, in contrast with primary necrosis, the timely removal by scavengers of dying/dead cells is carried out before occurrence of damage to the cytoplasmic membrane.
