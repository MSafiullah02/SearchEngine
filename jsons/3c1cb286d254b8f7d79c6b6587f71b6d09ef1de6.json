The number of infected chinese is today about 79251, which means that the effort to contrast the disease has been successful and almost completed. Fig. 4 shows the result of the fits using the South Korea data, from February the 20th to February the 29th.

On the other hand, Figs. 4 and 5 show that South Korea and Italy are in a different situation. In the latter cases, the observed data in the first week of March will be crucial to understand if the evolution will follow the GL or the LL, hence to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals. Therefore, this analysis suggests that a strong containment policy should be kept, at least until the fits clearly shows which growth law the evolution follows.",
