The seasonality of many of these pathogens makes if difficult to plan efficient and economic health care for affected patients.",

Moreover, those that became naturally infected suffered an increased rate of hospitalization due to pneumonia, bronchiolitis, rhinitis, or bronchitis.

RSV and hMPV belong to the same family of viruses (Paramyxoviridae), and a vaccine effective against both viruses would be highly desirable.

It was rapidly discovered that a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the cause, probably from wild-caught animals (e.g., via civet cats). The high mortality rate and potential for rapid spread gave great urgency to conventional (Table 2\n) and DNA vaccine initiatives (Table 3\n). A range of animal models has been used for testing, as no single model seems ideal. One particular concern is the possibility of enhancing disease (in a manner similar to that seen with formalin-inactivated RSV and feline peritonitis due to a coronavirus infection of cats), an effect already seen in murine models of SARS. Since SARS has now disappeared, it now seems unlikely that the opportunity will arise to test vaccine efficacy.",

Among 129 confirmed cases of H5N1 IAV infected humans, 60 were fatal by the time of writing (October 2005). Infections have been reported in the Netherlands (H7N7), the USA (H7N2), Hong Kong (H9N2), Canada (H7N3), and Egypt (H10N7), leading to fever, cough, and/or conjunctivitis progressing to respiratory failure and death in some infected persons. A major problem will be the ability to identify the correct subtype, scale up production, test vaccine stocks, and send out supplies of vaccine in time to have a significant impact on worldwide spread (Figure 2\n).",

It is therefore feasible to coexpress cytokines or chemokines from the host to cause selective enhancement of certain types of immunity that may be protective and nonpathogenic, reducing reactivity of a vaccine and lessening the chances of disease augmentation. Mutations in spontaneous attenuated mutants can be identified and engineered, and intelligent knockout live vectors created. In the long term, it may be possible to understand the reasons why some pathogens evade immune recognition and persist. Once this is understood, vaccines that are able to modify immune responses to clear persistent infections may become feasible.",

However, the majority of evidence exists for the secretion of antigen and phagocytosis/endocytosis by APCs for presentation via either the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II pathways. (3) Presentation via MHC class I induces CD8+ T-cells to differentiate into effector and memory T-cells, with the capacity to kill virus-infected cells. (4) Presentation via MHC class II induces CD4+ T-cell activation. In turn, these cells, known as helper T (Th1) cells, function to promote B-cell antibody production and survival via CD40L\u2013CD40 stimulation. This same interaction and interleukin (IL-2) secretion acts to help CD8+ T-cell functions. CD4+ T-cells also secrete a multitude of cytokines (e.g., interferon gamma, IFN-\u03b3) with consequent immunoregulatory effects.
