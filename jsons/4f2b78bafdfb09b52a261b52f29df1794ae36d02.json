These include an acute increase in one or more of the following cardinal symptoms, beyond day to day variability: dyspnea, increased frequency or severity of cough and increased volume or change in character of sputum, which represent an acute increase in airway infl ammation. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of COPD, acute exacerbation and disease progression has been a clinical and research question for many years, and the pendulum has swung from infection as a major cause of acute exacerbation and COPD (British Hypothesis) [ 2 ] , to infection as an unrelated epiphomenon in acute exacerbation [ 3 -5 ] , and back again to infection as integral in the development of AECOPD and likely an important contributor to COPD progression [ 6 -19 ] . Upwards of 80 % of AECOPD are driven by infectious stimuli, with 40-50 % associated with bacterial infection and 30-50 % associated with acute viral infection, with some exacerbations having dual bacterial and viral causation [ 20 ] . Much of the advancement in our understanding of the role of infection is AECOPD is due to the advancement of clinical and research tools that have allowed researchers to accurately characterize the microbial pathogens, and better understand the host-pathogen interactions (Table 1 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 166, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 710, "end": 715, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 781, "end": 789, "text": "[ 3 -5 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 917, "end": 926, "text": "[ 6 -19 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1161, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1436, "end": 1446, "text": "(Table 1 )", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "With the more recent scientifi c acceptance of infectious organisms, both viral and bacterial, as signifi cant players in AECOPD, the host response in patients with COPD must also be questioned.

The nature of the infl ammatory infi ltrate suggests and supports the fi ndings of both viral and bacterial infections, with recruitment of immune cells pertinent to both the innate and adaptive immune response. Despite the recruitment of appropriate effector immune cells, in many patients with advanced stage COPD (GOLD III-IV), there is persistent presence of pathogens in the airway, rather than eradication [ 19 , 28 ] , suggesting an impaired host response to infection. Numerous studies have delineated impaired macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine secretion [ 29 -31 ] , impaired humoral immune response to infection [ 32 -37 ] and impaired T-lymphocyte responses [ 38 ] .

There were no differences observed in sputum bacterial isolation rates (at a species level) in between stable state and exacerbations, and studies of immune response studies to bacterial pathogens and placebo controlled antibiotic trials showed inconsistent and contradictory results [ 4 , 39 ] . Beginning in 1992, multiple investigators began to recognize an effect of bacterial infection and colonization in stable COPD [ 11 , 17 , 32 , 40 -45 ] , but a direct association with AECOPD was not initially recognized. The bacterial isolation in these early studies was done predominantly by sputum culture, and as such, most pathogens isolated can be nasopharyngeal commensals in healthy adults, raising the issue of specimen contamination. In addition, the older studies could not differentiate among strains of a pathogenic species, assuming that all strains isolated from sputum over time were identical. Advancing diagnostic techniques of bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushes and bronchoalveolar lavage, as well as molecular bacterial typing allowed identifi cation of bacteria ( Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus infl uenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and others at potentially pathogenic concentrations) in the distal airways in stable COPD [ 9 , 17 , 28 , 40 , 41 , 46 -51 ] , with more severe GOLD stage disease being associated with identifi cation of Pseudomonas. Subsequent studies went on to associate colonization with more severe spirometric airfl ow obstruction [ 43 ] . Expanding on the recognition of bacterial colonization during stable COPD, it was recognized that the prevalence of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract increased signifi cantly during AECOPD as compared to stable COPD, when sampled by bronchoscopy [ 10 , 46 -48 , 52 ] . Scientifi c advancement led to the recognition that changes in the overall numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the airways between periods of colonization and acute exacerbation mattered less than the acquisition of a new strain of bacteria [ 10 , 15 -17 , 28 , 47 ] . Acquisition of a new strain of bacteria ( H. infl uenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa ) was associated with a greater likelihood of symptoms of an exacerbation, increased infl ammatory markers both locally and systemically (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6, CRP, Neutrophil elastase) and development of a specifi c host immune response to the infecting pathogen [ 8 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 28 , 47 ] . Although some authors have described a link between the presence of Chlamydia penumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella infection and AECOPD [ 53 -55 ] , these studies measured single serologic titers rather than serologic conversion, and an additional respiratory pathogen was often identifi ed. Studies using serologic conversion as a diagnostic criterion or molecular detection to identify the presence of atypical bacterial DNA in sputa [ 56 ] during AECOPD indicate only a minor role of these bacteria in exacerbations, often with co-infection with typical bacterial pathogens ( Table 1 ) . The signifi cant role of bacteria in both pathogenesis of COPD and AECOPD, combined with recent data from improved microbiological detection techniques that the normal lung is not sterile, has led to recent research focused on understanding the microbiome of the lung in stable COPD and during exacerbations. Two groups recently published data using PhyloChip microarray analysis and quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of the variable regions of the 16S rDNA. The fi rst study identifi ed the bacterial diversity seen during severe AECOPD requiring intubation in eight patients [ 57 ] , noting signifi cant bacterial richness (as defi ned by the number of bacterial taxa detected) that waned with prolonged intubation. The common 'core' of 75 bacterial taxa representing 27 classifi ed bacterial families was identifi ed in all patients studied. This group included members of the Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacteraceae and Helicobacteraceae families, among others. The majority of the bacteria belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum, with smaller contributions from Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The second study addressed the effects of cigarette smoke on the bacterial diversity in comparing healthy smokers to smokers with COPD to non-smokers [ 58 ] . The investigators demonstrated lung resident bacteria in all groups, and the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, as noted in the fi rst study. There was heterogeneity in the bacterial communities in the non-smoker, healthy smoker and mild COPD patients, which was lost in the patients with moderate and severe COPD. Within each patient, geographic differences in bacterial heterogeneity were also noted, suggesting micro-anatomic differences in bacterial communities within the lung. Whether the micro-anatomic, spatially distinct bacterial communities within the lung or the overall airway bacterial diversity represent mechanisms of disease progression or contribute to AECOPD remains to be determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 539, "end": 549, "text": "[ 4 , 39 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 678, "end": 703, "text": "[ 11 , 17 , 32 , 40 -45 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1575, "text": "[ 9 , 17 , 28 , 40 , 41 , 46 -51 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1777, "text": "[ 43 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2052, "text": "[ 10 , 46 -48 , 52 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2306, "end": 2331, "text": "[ 10 , 15 -17 , 28 , 47 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2730, "text": "[ 8 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 28 , 47 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2881, "end": 2891, "text": "[ 53 -55 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3187, "text": "[ 56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3915, "end": 3921, "text": "[ 57 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4601, "end": 4607, "text": "[ 58 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3324, "end": 3333, "text": "Table 1 )", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Bacterial Etiology of AECOPD"}, {"text": "Respiratory tract viral infections have long been suspected as capable of inciting infl ammation suffi cient to generate an acute exacerbation of COPD.
