In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and a-ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and a-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R 2 value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. Our proposed MLR model can predict the favorable binding energy compared with the binding energy detected from molecular docking. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show that these selected phytochemicals can be used as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2.",

The enzymatic activity of this protein leads to processing of viral polyproteins. The $306 amino acid long main protease has high structural and sequence similarity to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro . The SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro) monomer consists of N-terminal domain-I, N-terminal domain-II, and C-terminal domain-III (Mirza & Froeyen, 2020) . The active site of enzyme contains a catalytic dyad having Cys145 and His41 (Bacha et al., 2004; Khan, Zia, et al., 2020) . HIV drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir have been explored recently against MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al., 2020) . In addition, peptidomimetic a-ketoamides were designed and synthesized to test their performance against the main proteases of betacoronaviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and the 3CLpro of enteroviruses. In a recent follow-up study, Zhang et al. resolved the crystal structure of Mpro complex of SARS-CoV-2 with modified a-ketoamide inhibitors . After the outbreak, several types of drugs alone or with combination have been using in many countries Gautret et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . However, still there is no definite antiviral drug to fight against the deadly virus.",

Herein, we have selected 40 known phytochemicals isolated from natural herbs and fruits. These phytochemicals have already showed antiviral activity against different viruses. The aim of this study is to explore and identify the binding affinities and interactions of these antiviral phytochemicals against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using computational and statistical tools. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics, principal component analysis (PCA), and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) are performed to assess the performance of these phytochemicals. In addition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of the best candidates are evaluated.",

Optimization of the phytochemicals and calculation of vibrational frequency were performed using Gaussian 09 software package (Frisch et al., 2009) . The structure of the phytochemicals was optimized at semi-empirical PM6 method (Stewart, 2007) . The crystal structure of the main protease was taken from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7). Then the crystal structure of the protease was optimized and checked by Swiss-PDB viewer software packages (version 4.1.0) based on their least energy. Some significant factors, such as improper bond order, side chain geometry, and missing hydrogen, were observed in the crystal structure of the protease. PyMol (version 1.1) software package was used to erase all the hetero atoms, water molecules, and inhibitor present in the structure (DeLano, 2002) . Finally, the non-covalent interaction of phytochemicals-protease was calculated using Autodock Vina software package for the docking analysis (Trott & Olson, 2009) . Using this method, binding affinities of ligand-protease were determined and reported in kcal/mol unit. The grid box in Autodock Vina was generated targeting the active site of the main protease, where the center was at X: \u00c011.76, Y: 15.17, Z: 69.19 and the dimensions of the grid box were, X: 25.22, Y: 29.33 and Z: 29.22 (unit of the dimensions, \u00c5). To get more insights of these results, GOLD (Jones et al., 1997) docking program was also employed.",

The AMBER14 force field was employed for this study to describe the macromolecular system (Dickson et al., 2014) . Water and Na \u00fe /Clions were also added to the system. Periodic boundary condition was incorporated to perform the simulation, where the cell size was 20 \u00c5 larger than the protease size in all cases. By employing steepest gradient approach (5000 cycles), the initial energy minimization for each system was performed. MD simulations were performed using the PME method to designate longrange electrostatic interactions at a cut off distance of 8 \u00c5, and defining physiological conditions at 310 K, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl (Krieger et al., 2006) . The simulation temperature was controlled using the Berendsen thermostat, where the pressure kept constant throughout the simulation. A multiple time step algorithm was employed, where the simulation time step was selected as 1.25 fs (Krieger & Vriend, 2015) . Finally, MD simulation was performed for 100 ns long and snapshots were saved at every 100 ps into MD trajectory for further analysis. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), rootmean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and total number of Hbond count were calculated from the MD simulations similar to other studies (Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Enayatkhani et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2020 ).",

In GOLD scoring system, higher fitness score indicates the better docking interaction between ligand and protein. The binding affinity and fitness score of all phytochemicals are shown in Table 1 . Based on the best binding affinities, hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, and glabridin are selected for further analysis.

It is observed from Figure 3a that a-ketoamide-11r complex exhibits the lowest RMSD than other complexes. Even RMSD of the apo-protein is slightly higher than the a-ketoamide-11r, which indicates the greater stability of a-ketoamide-11r. The RMSD of baicalin-protein complex reaches to $1.63 \u00c5 from 10 to 50 ns, however, this value significantly increases after 50 ns and reaches to 2.24 \u00c5. While assessing the RMSD of cyanidin 3-glucoside complex, the steady increase of RMSD is observed after 21 ns (average RMSD >3.0 \u00c5). Nonetheless, this value is decreased eventually, which indicates that cyanidin 3-glucoside may change the protein conformation. Unlike apo-protein and a-ketoamide-11r complex, RMSD of the glabridin complex is mostly stable. But the complex is found exhibiting its increased RMSD from 45.6 to 78 ns (average RMSD >2.74 \u00c5), and subsequently the complex gets stable. Particularly, the hypericin complex shows consistent fluctuation from 11 to 100 ns. This complex also shows the higher deviation of fluctuations throughout the trajectory. Since RMSF (root means square fluctuation) helps to understand the region of protein that is being fluctuated during the simulation, the flexibility of each residue is calculated to get better insight on what extent the binding of ligand affects the protein flexibility. It can be understood from Figure 3b that the binding of hypericin makes the protein most flexible in all areas in contrast to apo-protein and the other complexes. Hypericin is found to induce local flexibility at Met49 (S2 pocket), Asn51, Pro52, Tyr154, Asp248, Arg279, and Phe294. The apo-protein structure is found to have the lowest RMSF, which indicates that even in unliganded state, the protein is not very much flexible. Besides, the RMSF values of other complexes including a-ketoamide-11r, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and glabridin are mostly similar in all areas. Overall, the residues such as Ile136, Lys137, Gly138, Ser139, Phe140 (S1 pocket), Leu141, Asn142, Asp153, Typ154, Arg222, Ser301, Val303, Thr304, Phe305, and Gln306 are found flexible for both of apo-protein and ligand-bound complexes.",

Interestingly, cyanidin 3-glucoside complex shows quite similar fluctuations from 60 to 100 ns as exhibited by a-ketoamide-11r complex. It signifies its SASA mediated behavior as it is also observed by a-ketoamide-11r complex. Although the SASA of glabridin complex is observed in the median till 46 ns compared to other complexes as described earlier, the fluctuations are quite irregular from 66 to 78 ns. The average SASA value of all systems are 14160.7, 13985.1, 14209.3, 14039.9, 13958.4, and 13955.1 for apo-protein, a-ketoamide-11r, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, glabridin, and hypericin, respectively. The first and second lowest average SASA is found for hypericin and glabridin complexes. The radius of gyration (Rg) represents the compactness of a structure. The lower degree of fluctuation with its consistency throughout the simulation indicates the greater compactness and rigidity of a system. The Rg of apo-protein is found almost stable in terms of consistency of fluctuations throughout the simulation. Besides, the Rg of a-ketoamide-11r is increased from 22 to 95.6 ns (average Rg $ 22.82). The greater change of Rg might be the result of protein folding, or unique conformational changes. The baicalin complex shows increased Rg from 78 to 100 ns (average Rg $ 22.50), and its last parts of the trend are similar to a-ketoamide-11r. In case of cyanidin 3-glucoside complex, the lowest Rg value is observed from 80 to 100 ns, which indicates greater rigidness in contrast to the other complexes. Besides, the glabridin complex seems to have lowest Rg corresponding to its highest rigidity from 0 to 40 ns and 63 ns to 77 ns. The Rg value of hypericin is much higher after 20 ns (average Rg $ 23.16) indicating its slackness of packing compared to all other complexes. On the basis of average Rg, the glabridin complex has the lowest Rg, which are calculated as 22.24, while for apo-protein, a-ketoamide-11r, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and hypericin, the Rg values are determined as 22.35, 22.74, 22.34, 22.32, and 23 .03, respectively.

Herein multiple linear regression (MLR) has been used for further analysis. For instance, TPSA (\u00c5 2 ), molecular weight, XLogP3, H-bond donor count, and H-bond acceptor count of the ligands are the most significant variables on QSAR contributors to the MLR regression (Table S3) . PCA is used for pattern recognition of potential ligands, which is represented in this study by PCA score plot (Figure 5c ). The first principal component (PC1) shows 57% of the variability in ligand QSAR and 21% of the variation of ligand binding energy. Second principal component (PC2) exhibits 22% in QSAR variability of ligands and the variation of the ligands binding energy is 11%. An interesting grouping of the ligands is observed by the score plot. The ligands with a similar functional group are gathered together side by side on the score plot. For example, ligands (L6, L7, L12, L15, L16, L22, and L25) containing -OH, -COOH, and C \u00bc O functional group attached to benzene ring are clustered on the first and second quadrants of the score plot.

In contrast, ligands containing isoflavane backbone in (L4, L8, L17, L18, and L19) are clustered on the third and fourth quadrants of the score plot. The observed grouping of ligands on the score plot is highly significant. In addition, this class of ligands has cyclic ether, -OH, -COOH groups, which may have a significant influence on drug reactivity, chemical behavior, therapeutic effect, and potency. L11 and L13 contain common anthraquinone derivative with fused ring and -OH functional group. This isoflavane and anthraquinone backbone pattern could be a key for further investigations to explore new drugs for COVID-19.",

SASA of a-ketoamide-11r also confirms that it unfolds and stabilizes the main protease. Cyanidin 3-glucoside has lower Rg and SASA values, which indicates that it can make the protease more compact and rigid. Moreover, the lowest RMSF value of the apo-protein indicates its compactness even without forming a complex with a ligand. Except hypericin, all the selected phytochemicals demonstrate similar patterns in RMSF. Hypericin is the most flexible in all areas in contrast to apo-protein and other complexes. Baicalin also shows lower RMSD value and followed the similar trend. Principal component analysis reveals the structural similarity between a-ketoamide-11r-protein and cyanidin 3-glucoside-protein complexes, which is strongly supported by the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA analysis. PCA analysis unveils that baicalin could be a good candidate to stabilize the main protease as supported by the RMSD analysis.",

To be a promising drug candidate, pharmacokinetic parameters must be optimized so that these can pass standard clinical trial criteria. The best five phytochemicals are found to be noncarcinogenic as evidence obtained from carcinogenicity and rat acute toxicity. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and glabridin might cross the bloodbrain barrier. All selected phytochemicals might interact with p-glycoprotein which is a member of ABC transporter family and they will not inhibit organic cation transporter. These parameters provide information about the secretion of drugs through urine. Only cyanidin 3-glucoside could show negative result in terms of human intestinal absorption. These pieces of information may provide necessary data for designing promising and effective inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 in future (Cheng et al., 2012; Motohashi & Inui, 2013; Mukhametov & Raevsky, 2017) .",

            "text": "In summary, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, QSAR modeling, PCA, and ADMET tools are successfully employed to determine the best phytochemicals against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Among the studied 40 phytochemicals, hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and a-ketoamide-11r show the highest binding affinity and strong interactions with both or at least one of the catalytic residues (Cys145 and His41) of the main protease. These compounds show many non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. MD results show that in the physiological environment, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and a-ketoamide-11r are the most stable ligands and they are making a greater number of interactions through hydrogen bonds with the main protease. Pharmacokinetic and ADMET analysis indicate their efficacy as drug molecules. PCA of QSAR results show that the ligands, e.g. L6, L7, L12, L15, L16, L22, and L25 containing -OH, -COOH, and C \u00bc O functional groups attached to their benzene ring are grouped together in the first and second quadrants of the score plot. Only a-ketoamide-11r (L3) with -CONH-and C \u00bc O functional groups take position on the upper right corner of the score plot. The ligands, e.g. L4, L8, L17, L18, L19, L11, and L13 containing isoflavane backbone, anthraquinone with cyclic ether, fused ring, -OH, and -COOH are placed in the third and fourth quadrants of the score plot. Therefore, PCA analysis successfully divides the studied phytochemicals into two groups. The MLR model calculates the value of R 2 , which is 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. It means that our proposed model can predict the binding energies compared to the values obtained from molecular docking. It can be concluded that most of the selected phytochemicals show promise and can be used to design effective antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2.",
