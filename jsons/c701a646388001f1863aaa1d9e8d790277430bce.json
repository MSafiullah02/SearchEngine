The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.",

            "text": "The present outbreak of the coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease is named coronavirus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof disease 19 (COVID-19) by WHO. Since the pandemic of COVID-19, more than 332, 930 people from 147 countries and territories have been confirmed sicked and more than 14, 510 have died from the rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus as of March 23, 2020 [2]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses infecting vertebrates, named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. Coronaviruses belong to the familyCoronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses can widely spread in humans, other mammals, and birds, and cause diseases such as the respiratory, intestinal, liver, and nervous systems. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s. Seven common HCovs are CoV-229E (alpha coronavirus), CoV-NL63 (alpha coronavirus), CoV-OC43 (beta coronavirus), CoV-HKU1 (beta coronavirus), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and current SARS-CoV-2. CoV-229E and CoV-OC43 are the cause of the common cold in adults during the mid-1960s. Disease manifestations associated with CoV-HKU1 and CoV-NL63 include the common cold and chronic pneumonia. Coronavirus-HKU1 has been predominantly reported in children in the United States but less common among adults. Three highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in 2002, 2012, and 2019, respectively, have caused severe respiratory disease and thousands of deaths worldwide [3]. SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus harbors a linear single-stranded positive RNA genome. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a leader sequence, ORF1ab that encodes proteins for RNA replication, and genes for non-structural proteins (nsp) and structural proteins. The genomic leader sequence of about 265 bp is the unique characteristic in coronavirus replication and plays critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication [4]. ORF1ab encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral RNA replication and transcription [5]. Expression of the C-proximal portion of ORF1ab requires (-1) ribosomal frame-shifting. The first non-structural protein (nsp) encoded by ORF1ab is Papain-like proteinase (PL proteinase, nps3). Nsp3 is an essential and the largest component of the replication and transcription complex. The PL proteinase cleaves non-structural proteins 1-3 and blocks the host's innate immune response, promoting cytokine expression [6, 7]. Nsp4 encoded in ORF1ab is responsible for forming double-membrane vesicle (DMV). The other non-structural proteins are 3CLPro protease (3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase, 3CLpro) and nsp6. 3CLPro protease is essential for RNA replication. The 3CLPro proteinase is accountable for processing the C-terminus of nsp4 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (UK), Unites States (US), and Vietnam (VN).

The RNA polymerase and primase mutations may confer resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity. The previous study indicated that a single mutation in RNA polymerase can improve the replication fidelity in RNA virus [37] . If a mutation is lethal or reduces the transmission ability, the mutations may not be carried on or get deceased.

The result suggests a number of high-frequency mutations that are associated with different critical proteins.

The aligned genomes are then re-positioned according to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank access number: NC_045512.2)[28]. The structural variants of deletion and insertions that form gaps in MSA are considered when mapping the SNPs onto the reference genome. Because of the limitation in sequencing technology, the individual virus genomes are not usually complete, the sequences at two ends are missing or uncertain, the length of the virus genomes are not the same as the reference genome. Therefore, the SNPs are positioned on the reference genome.",

The nucleotide positions are on the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2.The first common SNP mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is in the leader sequence (241C>T), an important genomic site for discontinuous sub-genomic replication. The leader sequence mutation 241C>T is co-evolved with three important mutations, 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G, which result in amino acid mutations in nsp3 (synonymous mutation), RNA primase (P323L), and spike glycoprotein (S protein, D614G), respectively. These three co-mutations (241C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G) are in critical pro teins for RNA replication (241C>T, 14408C>T) and the S protein (23403A>G) for binding to ACE2 receptor.

The strains from the same region are marked in the same color. The result shows that most SNP mutations in SARS-CoV-2 isolates in China and some from Europe and USA are located at two positions (8782C>T, 28144T->C) (Fig.4). Later on this strain was mutated at new positions (8782C>T, 28144T>C, 18060C>T). These mutations are from the early phase of the strain. The important and prevalent co-mutations (241C>T, 3037C>T, 23403A>G) occurred mostly in SARS-CoV-2 isolates in European countries. This strain has additional extended mutations at positions (241C>T, 3037C>T, 14408C>T, 23403A>G) (Fig.5)). The impacted critical proteins are NA pol (nsp8), RNA primase (nsp12), and the S protein. Most of the strains are found in European countries (Fig.5). Italy is being heavily infected by SARS-CoV-2 with 59, 138 confirmed cases and 5, 476 deaths as of March 23, 2020 [2]. These critical mutations may be correlated with the severe infections in Europe.From the SNP profiles of the viruses across the globe from a different time, we may estimate that one mutation can occur in one generation. For example, in USA (IL) two consecutive infection cases (US|IL1|EPI_ISL_404253|2020-01-21,US|IL2|EPI_ISL_410045|2020-01-28), the Therefore, we may estimate that the transmissio n of SARS-CoV-2 has reached 14 generations since its first infection to humans in December 2019.",

Our results show several molecular facets of the SARS-CoV-2 pertinent to this pandemic. The discovery of genotypes linked to geographic and temporal infectious clusters suggests that genome SNP signatures can be used to track and monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Rapid detection of different genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 are important for an efficient response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Discriminating and relating viral isolates can be useful in genetic epidemiology. Determining the origin and monitoring the transmission pattern of the pathogenic agents are critical to controlling the outbreak. In this work, the SNP genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 was developed by adapting fast MSA of the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SNP analytics using the directed Jaccard distance of the SNP profiles. The genotyping analysis provides insights on the frequent mutations that confer fast transmissibility of the virus. The major mutations are in the critical proteins, including the S protein, RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and",

The furin recognition site is important for being recognized by pyrolysis and therefore, contributing to the zoonotic infection of the virus. The envelope (E) protein interacts with membrane protein M in the budding compartment of the host cell. The M protein holdsThe increasing epidemiological and clinical evidence implicates that the SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger transmissibility than SARS-CoV and lower pathogenicity[23]. However, the mechanism of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. DNA sequence comparisons using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are often used for evolutionary studies and can be especially beneficial in recognizing the mutated coronavirus genomes, where high mutations can occur due to an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in genome replication[24,25].",
