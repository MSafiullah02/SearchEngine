The very flexuous and open structure of the particles is the most conspicuous trait of members of the family. Virions have a diameter of about 12 nm and lengths ranging from 650 nm (species with fragmented genome) to over 2000 nm (species with monopartite genome). The fragility of virions and a tendency to end-to-end aggregation contribute to the fact that a range of lengths is often given for single viruses. Two types of coat proteins, the major CP and a CP analog, or minor CP (CPm), are the most abundant protein components involved in the formation of (most) closterovirid particles. CPm encapsidates the 600\u2013700 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the viral RNA, coating one extremity (75\u2013100 nm) of the closterovirid particle, as shown for isolates of beet yellows virus (BYV), carrot yellow leaf virus (CYLV), citrus tristeza virus (CTV), grapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 (GLRaV-2) and lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV), thus forming a distinct structure for which the terms \u201crattlesnake\u201d, \u201cheterodimeric\u201d or \u201cbipolar\u201d have been coined (Figure 1 bottom).",

            "text": "Members of the family have one of the largest genomes among plant viruses because of sequence duplication and acquisition of nonviral coding sequences (e.g., protease, HSP70 protein) via RNA recombination. Recombination may also explain differences in genome organization between genera and members of the same genus. Genome organization, i.e. the number and relative position of the ORFs differs between the genera and/or individual viral species. However, the complex ORF1a\u2013ORF1b invariably encodes the replication-related proteins, with methyl-transferase (Mtr), helicase (Hel), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) conserved domains. Downstream ORFs, which encode in 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction a 6K small hydrophobic protein, the HSP70h, the ~60 kDa protein, the CP and CPm, form a five-gene module which is conserved, with few modifications, among most members of the family analysed so far. The HSP70h and the ~60 kDa proteins are integral virion components present in all the sequenced members of the family. The functions postulated for HSP70h are: mediation of cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata, involvement in the assembly of multisubunit complexes for genome replication and/or subgenomic RNAs synthesis, and assembly of virus particles. The ~60 kDa protein is required for incorporation of both HSP70h and CPm to virion heads. The duplication of the capsid protein gene seems to be the only example of such condition among viruses with elongated particles. In general, capsid proteins and their homologs (CPm) show a significant degree of sequence conservation and the duplicate copies probably retain the general spatial folding and some crucial properties of the CPs. Notable exception are a group of ampeloviruses with the smallest genomes in the family [e.g. grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4 (GLRaV-4), GLRaV-5, GLRaV-6, GLRaV-9, pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus 1(PMWaV-1) and PMWaV-3] which do not appear to possess CPm. The genome expression strategy is based on: (i) proteolytic processing of the polyprotein encoded by ORF1a; (ii) +1 ribosomal frameshift for the expression of the RdRp domain encoded by ORF1b, a mechanism not found in other (+)RNA plant viruses; (iii) expression of the downstream ORFs via the formation of a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs). The dsRNA patterns are very complex and variable among species, reflecting the different numbers and sizes of the ORFs present in individual genomes and, in some cases, the existence of defective RNAs. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm, possibly in association with endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranous vesicles and vesiculated mitochondria. From an evolutionary point of view, closteroviruses represent a monophyletic virus lineage that might have evolved from a smaller filamentous virus when higher plants have differentiated. This progenitor virus, thought to be composed of three genes encoding replication-associated proteins, a protein (p6) with affinity for cell membranes, and a single coat protein, acquired the HSP70h and a ~60 kDa protein derived from a fusion of two domains, N-terminal domain of unknown evolutionary provenance, and a duplicated capsid protein domain. Under the pressure of further modular evolutionary events, i.e. duplication of the coat protein gene, acquisition of diverse suppressors of RNA silencing and of additional genes acquired via horizontal gene transfer (e.g. papain-like cysteine proteinase and AlkB domains), this family ancestor gave rise to the progenitors of the three extant genera of the family. One of these genera (Crinivirus), differentiated further by splitting its genome in two or three genome components.",

            "text": "The natural and experimental host ranges of individual virus species are usually restricted, except for a few members of the genus Crinivirus. Disease symptoms are of the yellowing type (i.e. stunting, rolling, yellowing or reddening of the leaves, small and late ripening fruits), or pitting and/or grooving of the woody cylinder of woody hosts. Infection is systemic, but usually limited to\nthe phloem, which may necrotize to a varying extent. Few species of the genus Closterovirus are transmissible by mechanical inoculation, though with difficulty, but none of those in the genera Ampelovirus and Crinivirus. In vegetatively propagated crops long distance virus dissemination is primarily through infected propagating material. Some species can be transmitted through dodder (Cuscuta spp.). Transmission through seeds has not been ultimately proven. According to the genus, natural vectors are aphids, whiteflies, pseudococcid mealybugs and soft scale insects. Transmission is semi-persistent regardless of the type of vector. Geographical distribution varies from restricted to widespread, depending on the virus species, most of which occur in temperate or subtropical regions. Virions are usually found in the phloem (sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma), occasionally in the mesophyll and epidermis. Ultrastructural modifications arise by membrane proliferation, degeneration and vesiculation of mitochondria, and formation of inclusion bodies. These are made up of aggregates of virions or membranous vesicles, or a combination of the two. Virions accumulate in conspicuous cross-banded fibrous masses or, more typically, in more or less loose bundles intermingled with single or clustered membranous vesicles. Inclusions of this type are one of the hallmarks of the family. The vesicles contain a fibrillar network and derive either from the endoplasmic reticulum, or from peripheral vesiculation of mitochondria.",

It differs from the BYV genome in having two papain-like protease domains in ORF1a, an extra 5\u2032 proximal ORF (ORF2) encoding a 33 kDa product with no similarity to any other protein in databases, and two extra 3\u2032 proximal ORFs (ORF9 and ORF11); (iii) BYSV has 10 ORFs and a 3\u2032 UTR 241 nt in size, a length intermediate between that of the BYSV and CTV UTRs. A further difference with the BYV genome rests in the presence of an extra ORF (ORF2) encoding a 30 kDa polypeptide with no similarity to any other protein in databases. This ORF is located downstream of ORF1b, i.e. in the same position as the unrelated CTV ORF2. Thus, the organization of BYSV genomes is intermediate between that of BYV and CTV, suggesting that these three viruses might represent three distinct stages in closterovirus evolution. Non-structural proteins common to all members of the genus are: (i) a large polypeptide (over 300 kDa) containing the conserved domains of papain-like protease (P-Pro), methyltransferase (Mtr), and helicase (Hel); (ii) a ~50 kDa protein with all sequence motifs of viral RdRp of the \u201calpha-like\u201d supergroup of positive-strand RNA viruses; (iii) a 6 kDa hydrophobic protein with membrane-binding properties; (iv) the homolog of the cellular HSP70 heat-shock proteins (HSP70h); (v) a 55\u201364 kDa product, referred to as the ~60 kDa protein. Some of the structural and non structural proteins function as suppressors of the RNA silencing plant defence machinery. For instance, CP, p20 and p23 proteins of CTV have suppressor activity, much the same as the homologs of p21 of BYSV, BYV, and GLRaV-2. CTV p23 is a unique protein in the family and has a nucleolar localization. Silencing suppressors contribute to the accumulation of virus particles and are important determinants of pathogenesis.",

At one extreme there are grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1) and GLRaV-3, which has the largest genome of all (18,498 nt). GLRaV-3 has 12 ORFs, coding for the replication related proteins (ORFs 1a and 1b), two small hydrophobic proteins (6 kDa), the HSP70h, the ~60\u2013kDa protein, CP, CPm and five additional proteins 21, 20, 20, 4 and 7 kDa in size, respectively (Figure 4\n). The 5\u2019 UTR and 3\u2019 UTR are 737 and 277 nt in size, respectively. GLRaV-1 differs from all other members of the genus in encoding two copies of the CPm. At the other extreme there is a group of viruses infecting grapevine [e.g, grapevine leafroll-associated viruses 5 and 9 (GLRaV-5 and -9)] and pineapple [e.g. pineapple mealybug wilt-associated viruses 1 and 3 (PMWaV-1 and -3)]. All these viruses have a genome made up of seven ORFs and lack the CPm. PMWaV-1, a representative of this group, has a genome 13,071 nt in size, beginning with a 535 nt UTR at the 5\u2032 end, followed by the ORFs expressing, respectively, the replication related proteins, a 6 kDa hydrophobic protein, the HSP70h, the ~60 kDa protein, the CP and a 24 kDa protein. A UTR 132 nt in size terminates the genome. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm, likely in association with membranous vesicles, derived either from the endoplasmic reticulum or from peripheral vesiculation and disruption of mitochondria (GLRaV-1, GLRaV-3).

All molecules are needed for infectivity and are separately encapsidated. RNA-1 of LIYV contains three ORFs, i.e. the ORF1a\u2013ORF1b complex plus a 3\u2032-most ORF coding for a 32 kDa protein with no similarity to any protein in databases. This ORF is similar in size and location to ORF2 of CTV and BYSV but the respective expression products are not related. RNA-1 has 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of 97 and 219 nucleotides, respectively. As with other members of the family, the ORF1a\u2013ORF1b complex codes for the replication-related proteins including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNA-2 has seven ORFs flanked by a 5\u2032 UTR of 326 nt and a 3\u2032 UTR of 187 nt. RNA2 contains the five-gene module which, however, differs from that of members of the genus Closterovirus by the insertion of an extra gene (ORF4) upstream of the CP gene. As to PYVV: (i) RNA-1 (8035 nt in size) is composed of three ORFs, i.e. the ORF1a-ORF1b complex and a 7 kDa hydrophobic protein containing a potential transmembrane helix; (ii) RNA-2 (5,339 nt in size) comprising five predicted ORFs that encode, in the order, the HSP70h; a 7 kDa protein similar to a comparable protein of cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV); the ~60 kDa protein; a 9.8 kDa product with no significant similarity to any other sequence in database; the 28.2 kDa putative CP; (iii) RNA-3 (3892 nt) has three potential ORFs coding for a protein 4 kDa in size with no counterpart with other proteins in the family and no significant sequence homology in database; the 77.5 kDa CPm, and a 26.4 kDa protein present in other members of the genus. In all criniviruses, the order of the CP and CPm ORFs is reversed compared to that of species in the genus Closterovirus. Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) have a particularly large CPm (75\u201380 kDa), compared to LIYV (53 kDa). Replication occurs in the cytoplasm, likely in association with membranous vesicles, derived from the endoplasmic reticulum or from vesiculated mitochondria (CYSDV). Structural and non-structural proteins are similar in type and function to those reported for the genus Closterovirus. Both genomic RNAs of ToCV encode RNA silencing suppressors, e.g. the p22 protein in RNA-1 and CP and CPm in RNA-2. The p25 protein of CYSDV, the viral RNAse III and the p22 gene present in a few isolates of SPCSV also have suppressor activity.",
