Viruses have no mobility but must penetrate formidable barriers to enter the body of a susceptible human host. The skin is covered by a layer of keratinized cells that will not sustain virus replication, but arthropods and animal bites, needles, and tissue transplantation can breach this barrier directly (Table 1\n). The mucous membranes of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract are protected by secretory immunoglobulins, and all are monitored by macrophages that phagocytize viruses and other particles. In addition, the respiratory tract has a mucous coating and cilia that beat the film containing inhaled particles outward and away from the epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract, and the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts have extremes of acidity. A few nonenveloped, acid-resistant viruses (adenoviruses, enteroviruses, parvoviruses, and reoviruses) can survive passage through the acidity and solvents of the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "text": "Once permissive host cells are infected in the subcutaneous tissue, the mucous membranes, or the hematopoietic system (particularly macrophages), cycles of replication usually occur locally before there is invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). Pathways of spread into the CNS are along nerves or via the blood (Table 2\n). For many years, the nerves, both peripheral and olfactory, were regarded as the sole portals into the CNS, and early experimental studies documented the neural transmission of rabies virus, herpes simplex virus, and polioviruses. Nerve endings have receptors for some viruses, and the viruses are transported by the retrograde axon transport system to the cell bodies, where replication is possible. This transport occurs in the peripheral nervous system along motor and sensory fibers and also within the CNS, exemplified by the movement of polioviruses between spinal cord motor neurons and corresponding cortical neurons. The olfactory pathway is a unique venue for neural spread since the olfactory rods extend out from the olfactory mucosa and the central processes of the olfactory neurons synapse within the CNS. Thus, a single neuron can provide transport from the ambient environment to the CNS. Despite this direct connection, few aerosol or respiratory infections have been found to invade through the olfactory route.",

Some viruses infect cerebral endothelial cells or choroid plexus epithelial cells and \u201cgrow\u201d into the CNS. Others cross uninfected vascular endothelial cells into the brain in endocytotic vesicles or within infected mononuclear cells. Invasion from blood depends on the magnitude and duration of the viremia. Viruses in the blood are promptly removed by the reticuloendothelial system and, like other particles, speed of clearance is size dependent. Small viruses are removed more slowly, and many larger viruses avoid clearance by growth in leukocytes or adhesion to red cells.",

For example, rabies virus infects only neurons, and early in infection neurons that modify behavior are selectively affected. This explains the unique clinical syndrome of vigilance and agitation. Similarly, polioviruses selectively infect and destroy motor neurons causing the syndrome of flaccid paralysis. Arboviruses infect primarily neurons, and herpes simplex virus infects neurons, glia, and endothelial cells. JC virus selectively lyses oligodendrocytes causing demyelinating disease. Enteroviruses and mumps virus infect primarily meningeal and ependymal cells; therefore, they usually cause benign meningitis and only rarely are associated with encephalitis.",

Neurotropism is the ability to infect neural cells other than neurons and is distinct from neuronotropism, which indicates the ability to infect neurons. Neurovirulence relates to the ability to cause disease. Thus, mumps virus that can often be recovered from spinal fluid during uncomplicated parotitis is highly neuroinvasive, is neurotropic in ependymal cells but not neuronotropic, and has a low level of neurovirulence. In contrast, most arbovirus infections are asymptomatic or cause only fever, malaise, and minor systemic symptoms. On rare occasions when arboviruses infect the brain, they usually cause encephalitis with a significant death rate; thus, these viruses are not highly neuroinvasive but are highly neurotropic (and neuronotropic) and neurovirulent. It must be noted that neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence are also dependent on a myriad of host factors, such as age, immune responses, and genetic constitution.",

Encephalitis has been associated with approximately 100 different viruses that cause disease of variable severity (Table 3\n). Encephalitis is more common in children than in adults and varies by gender, season, and geographic location. For example, CNS complications of mumps virus infections are three times more common in males than females. Seasonally, enterovirus infections are more common in summer and early fall, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections are more common in winter, and arbovirus infections are more common during the feeding season of the transmitting arthropod. Regionally, rabies causes more than 25,000 deaths per year in India but only 1\u20135 deaths in the United States. Each year a variety of arboviruses cause 200\u20132000 cases of encephalitis in the United States, tick-borne encephalitis virus causes several thousand cases in Europe, and Japanese encephalitis virus causes approximately 30,000 cases in Asia.",

Occasionally, fever is not present at the time of presentation, stupor may obscure a complaint of headache, or nuchal rigidity may be absent; thus, no finding is absolute. Spinal fluid examination is critical for diagnosis. Typically, a mononuclear cell pleocytosis, modest elevation of protein, normal sugar content, and often increased pressure are found. Early in disease, polymorphonuclear cells may predominate or fluid may be acellular, but within 24 hr a mononuclear cell response usually evolves. In some infections mild depressions of sugar content are present. The presence of red cells may suggest herpetic encephalitis, but the finding is neither consistent nor specific.",

Herpes simplex virus encephalitis usually localizes to one or both temporal lobes, which may cause bizarre behavior, hallucinations, aphasia, and quadratic visual field defects. Imaging studies typically show low-density lesions in one or both temporal lobes with enhancement and mass effect. Only approximately one-half of patients with encephalitis with temporal lobe signs prove to have herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
