The ratio of observers to participants was 1:1. The observer randomly selected a clinical scenario. Then the participant was oriented to a mock patient room; the scenario was read aloud; the specific precaution was stipulated; and the participant was instructed to select, put on (don), and take off (doff) the appropriate PPE. Immediately after completing the infection control course, the participant was provided with the same scenario and given the same instructions.",

Our findings indicate that online infection control courses are able to adequately transfer knowledge regarding appropriate PPE selection and use. This method of delivery could improve an organization's capacity to provide standardized and accessible infection control training. Further studies are needed to verify that knowledge transfer is retained over time and that proper infection control practices are maintained in actual clinical settings.",
