Inhibitors have been both designed and discovered by targeting different components of the virus, including the interaction between the viral S protein and the host receptor, which mediates fusion and viral entry [10], cathepsin L (to decrease membrane fusion) [11], 3CLpro [9], RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [12], [13], and helicase [14], [15]. So far, these compounds have been predominantly tested for their in vitro efficacy and no human clinical trials have ever been initiated. Recently, an animal model mimic the mortality and human disease syndrome as induced by a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV has been set up [16], which will provide the opportunity to test the effectiveness of the inhibitors for in vivo efficacy. Proteases remain one of the most prominent and effective drug targets in antiviral therapies, including those directed against human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and other viral infections [17], [18]. Because proteolytic processing is essential for the generation of a functional replication complex, 3CLpro and PLpro are potentially effective targets for anti-SARS drugs. Most efforts reported until now have focused on the development of 3CLpro inhibitors [9]. However, except our previous observation that the zinc ion inhibits PLpro of SARS-CoV [19], no inhibitor of this protease has yet been reported.",

            "text": "PLpro of SARS-CoV is a papain-like cysteine protease with deubiquitinating activity. It is located on polypeptide 1a and self-cleaves at three sites on the polypeptide. Its catalytic triad (Cys1651\u2013His1812\u2013Asp1826) has a broad range of pH optima, characteristic of papain-like cysteine proteases [19], [20]. Moreover, PLpro has deubiquitinating activity in vitro, and is capable of hydrolyzing diubiquitin, polyubiquitin, and synthetic ubiquitin peptide substrates [20], [21]. Recently, its crystal structure has been solved, and it shows great similarity to those of two other mammalian deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP14 and herpesvirus-associated uiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) [22], [23], [24]. Despite low sequence identity (around 10%), these three proteins share similar tripartite architectures, comprising finger, palm, and thumb domains. There is also a ubiquitin-like domain at the amino terminus of PLpro, which might be responsible for its association with 26S proteasomes, as has been observed for USP14 and a yeast DUB called ubp6 [25]. PLpro also has de-ISGylation activity [21]. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in the posttranslational modification of proteins. The biological functions of the deubiquitination and de-ISGylation activities of PLpro and its in vivo substrates are unknown at present.",

Interestingly, we found that, apart from the zinc ion [19], thiocarbonyl-containing 6MP (compound 1) and 6TG (compound 2) were effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, with IC50 values of 21.6 and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 1\n). NEM (compound 6), a commonly used cysteine protease inhibitor that acts by covalently modifying the active-site Cys through Michael addition, was also found to be an effective inhibitor of PLpro with an IC50 value of 4.4 \u03bcM, however, it was not further investigated. Because PLpro is a deubiquitination enzyme with a structure highly homologous to those of other DUBs [20], [21], [24], we next tested whether 6MP and 6TG also inhibited the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro. Using ubiquitin\u2013AMC as the substrate, we found that 6MP, 6TG, and Zn2+ effectively inhibited the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro (Fig. 1\n). To determine whether this inhibition is reversible, we first incubated the enzyme with both 6MP and 6TG until no activity of the enzyme could be detected. Next, the enzyme was purified with gel filtration, followed by new activity measurement. The enzymatic activity was restored, suggesting that the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex dissociated on the column and/or by dilution in the assay buffer, which is indicative of reversible inhibition.",

A sub-structure search based on the structures of 6MP and 6TG was carried out using the software ISIS (http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/dataanalysis/) against the MDL Available Chemical Directory (MDL ACD). Since the major difference between adenosine and 6MP/6TG lies in the thiocarbonyl group, we searched for the different substituted group at this site in the database. Compounds 3, 4 and 5 were discovered and available to purchase commercially (Section 2). Replacement of the thiocarbonyl of 6MP or 6TG with either hydroxyl (compound 3) or a methylthio group (compounds 4 and 5) resulted in compounds devoid of inhibitory activity (Table 1), suggesting that the thiocarbonyl group of 6MP or 6TG is the active pharmacophore for the inhibition. To gain further insight into the inhibition mechanism, a docking experiment was performed. PLpro exists as a monomer in solution [19]. In the crystallization form, there are three monomers existing in the asymmetric unit [24]. The active sites for all three units were the same (data not shown). So we chose subunit one for the modeling study. Both 6MP and 6TG fit well into the active-site cavity of PLpro. The sulfur atom of 6MP or 6TG was juxtaposed closely with the \u03b3-S of Cys1651 at a distance of 3.4 \u00c5, suggesting possible formation of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2\n). This is consistent with the active chemical properties of the thiocarbonyl group. The best docking scores for 6MP and 6TG binding to PLpro were 23.9 and 24.4, respectively. Moreover, the binding energies of 6MP and 6TG to PLpro were 8.2 and 14.7 kcal/mol, respectively.",

The inhibition data were globally fitted to all possible kinetic models (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed competitive). As shown in Fig. 3\n, a simple competitive inhibition pattern best described the data for the following two reasons: (i) the double reciprocal plot with all lines intercepted the y-axis for both 6MP (Fig. 3A) and 6TG (Fig. 3B) and (ii), the slope versus inhibitor concentration replot was linear (Fig. 3, both insets). Therefore, consistent with the docking result (Fig. 2), both 6MP and 6TG may compete with the peptide substrate for the active site via a competitive mechanism. The best fit of Eq.

As summarized in Table 2, in the pH range from 6.2 to 8.0, which was shown previously to be optimal for the enzymatic activity of PLpro [19], the K\nm values for substrate hydrolysis in the absence of inhibitors ranged from 17 to 25 \u03bcM, whereas the k\ncat values ranged from 0.06 to 0.13 s\u22121.

For 6MP, the semi-log plots of E\nt/E\n0 versus time were linear in the initial stage (Fig. 4A), and the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k\ninact) at different inhibitor concentrations followed saturation kinetics (Fig. 4C). For 6TG, the emission curve was curved downwards, indicating a slow-binding mechanism (Fig. 4B). By fitting the data to Eq. (4) for 6TG (Fig. 4B) (Section 2), different k\ninact values at various concentration of 6TG were determined (Fig. 4D). When we further fitted the saturated curvature to Eq. (5), we determined that the K\ninact values for 6MP and 6TG were 48 and 32 \u03bcM, respectively, and the k\nmax of inactivation were 0.12 and 0.92 ms\u22121, respectively (Table 2). 6TG is a slightly more potent inhibitor than 6MP, as indicated by a slightly lower K\ninact and a eight-fold higher k\nmax. In summary, both 6MP and 6TG are slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, although both 6MP and 6TG have binding affinities for PLpro similar to that of the peptide substrate (Table 2). Based on the above kinetic and modeling results, we propose the following kinetic mechanism (Fig. 5\n). 6MP or 6TG might form a hydrogen bond with the enzyme's active site Cys1651 through the thio moiety of the thiocarbonyl group. The hydrogen bonding with Cys1651 blocks the essential sulfhydryl group, preventing its acylation and inhibiting the enzyme's activity.",

Initially, the other SARS-CoV protease 3CLpro, which is also a cysteine protease, was tested for possible inhibition by 6MP and 6TG. A comparison with PLpro was therefore made at 200 \u03bcM inhibitor concentration and a 2 h incubation time. Whereas both inhibitors at this concentration almost completely abolished the activity of PLpro (<5% residual activity), they were found to be much less effective inhibitors of 3CLpro (49% residual activity for 6MP and 25% for 6TG, respectively). In the next step, we also used molecular modeling to dock the inhibitors to 3CLpro. The best docking scores for 6MP and 6TG to 3CLpro were 17.8 and 18.4, respectively, which are lower than those for 6MP and 6TG (23.9 and 24.4, respectively). Moreover, the binding energies of 6MP and 6TG to 3CLpro were \u221214.7 and \u221216.2 kcal/mol, respectively, which are lower than those to PLpro (8.2 and 14.7 kcal/mol, respectively). Finally, the sulfur atoms of 6MP and 6TG occur at distances of 5.4 and 8.5 \u00c5, respectively, from the \u03b3-S of Cys145 of 3CLpro, too far away to maintain a functional hydrogen bond. Therefore, the lower binding energies, lower docking scores, and greater distances of the drugs from 3CLpro are consistent with the biochemical data that these two drugs are not effective inhibitors of 3CLpro. Moreover, 6MP and 6TG were not effective inhibitors of other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B, K, L, and S, and papain, even at a concentration of 1 mM (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that 6MP and 6TG are reasonably selective inhibitors of PLpro and do not inhibit other cysteine proteases.",

In light of the acute toxicities associated with these drugs and the active thiocarbonyl against subsets of cysteine proteases, the in vivo action of 6MP and 6TG might be more complex than we realize at this stage. It is well documented that 6MP causes some adverse drug reactions in a significant number of patients, which have been found to be caused by a genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The polymorphism produces a TPMT with much lower activity [37], [38]. These patients are less able to metabolize 6MP to the inactive 6-methyl mercaptopurine, resulting in the accumulation of 6TG and subsequent life-threatening myelosuppression [37], [38], [39]. About 1 in 300 individuals carries a mutated TPMT and does not express fully functional TPMT [40]. For these patients, less than 10% of the normal dosage of 6MP can be tolerated [39]. It is likely that locally high dosage of 6MP/6TG might inhibit the subset of cysteine proteases, thereby contributing to the severe cytotoxic effects observed by these two drugs. Furthermore, 6MP can also be metabolically processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 to purine-6-sulfenic acid, which binds to proteins by forming disulfide bonds with the thio moieties of the proteins both in vitro and in vivo [41], [42]. Whether purine-6-sulfenic acid forms the disulfide bonds with cellular cysteine proteases remains to be studied.",

            "text": "We speculate that DUBs are the in vivo targets of 6MP and 6TG, based on our study of the mechanism of inhibition of PLpro, the selectivity of 6MP and 6TG, and the structural similarity of PLpro to other DUBs. To date, there is no potent selective chemical compound available for the inhibition of cellular deubiquitination enzymes other than a ubiquitin aldehyde developed for laboratory studies of the function of DUBs by covalent attachment to the active-site Cys [43], [44]. Hence, the biological consequences of inhibiting DUBs are not clear at the moment. Moreover, the functions of the deubiquitination and de-ISGylation activities of PLpro in vivo are also unknown, as are those of its in vivo cellular substrates. Adenovirus encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme [45], which is necessary for processing viral precursor proteins during virion maturation [46]. ISGylation and de-ISGylation are involved in the innate immune response to viral infection [47]. Therefore, whether 6MP and 6TG inactivate the cellular DUBs that contribute to adverse drug reactions or other biological consequences requires further investigation. Because both drugs are still used extensively in clinics, especially for children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia [26], [27], our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth these drug actions in vivo.",
