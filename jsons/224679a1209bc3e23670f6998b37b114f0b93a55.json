With the emergence of the COVID-19 virus and considering the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatment for it, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs or potential adjuvant therapy in this regard. Bioactive lipids with an array of known healthpromoting properties can be suggested as effective agents in alleviating acute respiratory stress induced by virus. The bioactive lipid amide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), due to several distinctive homeostatic properties, including anti-inflammatory activities, modulation of immune response, and anti-oxidant effects can be considered as a novel potential pharmacological alternative for the management of COVID-19.",

            "text": "This highly transmittable and pathogenic viral belongs to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales (4). The subfamily of coronaviruses family includes alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3) and delta (\u03b4) coronavirus (5) . Coronaviruses were initially thought to infect only animals, but evidences from the last decade indicate that the disease is capable of membrane. Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length (8) . An analysis of genome sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 79% similar to SARS-CoV at the nucleotide sequence. Interestingly, new evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is well suited for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are expressed in the membranes of various cells in the body, such as type II alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs. In fact, binding of the SARS-CoV to the ACE2 (9) receptors, disrupts the function of it (10). Intestine, kidney and blood vessels are the other main cells for ACE2 expression, and this fact may explain why some patients with Covid-19 experience gastrointestinal symptoms (11) . The virus binds to the host-cell ACE2 receptor via a particular surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" (peplomer), and enters the host cell. It is supposed that the entry of the virus to human cells increases the inflammatory activity through various mechanisms with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause serious damage, specially to the respiratory tract (12) . Theoretically, it is assumed that a decrease in the activity of ACE2 in cell membranes may reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate cells (13) .",

OEA, a member of the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family, is derived from the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid. Previous studies have indicated that the down-regulation of OEA levels arises in situation such as exposure to stress, which contributes to the increase in inflammatory markers and the NAE catabolism (15, 16) . In the current epidemiological studies on inflammatory-related diseases, OEA is considered an endocannabinoid-like lipid, which interacts with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) and mediates the anti-inflammatory processes (17) . It is generally accepted that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of the membrane cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid receptor type 1 [CB1R] and type 2 [CB2R]), endogenous ligands (endcannabinoids), and enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of ligands (18). The collaboration of the ECS in the management and elimination of infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, and some protozoa is indicated previously (19) . Scientific researchers recently showed that the activation of the ECS relieves pain and reduces inflammation in the lungs. Based on their evidence, endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids can be considered as therapeutic potential agents for respiratory pathogen clearance (20) .",

In other words, OEA may have a beneficial synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. OEA, a high affinity endogenous ligand of PPAR-\u03b1 (28), binds to PPAR-\u03b1 receptors, and increases the expression level of anti-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-10. In addition, it attenuates the inflammatory responses and decreases the expression of TLR4, and interfering with the ERK1/2/AP-1/STAT3 signaling cascade (29) (30) (31) . In a recent clinical trial, OEA supplementation could decrease inflammation in obese patients via reducing serum concentrations of inflammatory markers including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (32). On the whole, the results found in previous studies demonstrate that the activation of PPAR-\u03b1 by OEA can prevent the expression of genes coding for several inflammatory cytokines. It is well established that OEA can also significantly reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and prevents endothelial cell damage.",

SARS outbreak caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 in Guangdong, China, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prevalence in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, were approval for the possibility of the virus spread in humans and the witness for the lethality of coronaviruses (6,7). Genetic recombination event at S protein in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be the most important reason for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 regarding to SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2, a large sized virus (approximately 120 nanometers in diameter), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, and contains an outer lipid (fatty)",
