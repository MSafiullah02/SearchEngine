During this time, professional medical societies have provided guidance regarding the care of COVID-19 patients, including precautions during intubation/extubation, patient transport to the OR, care of the anesthesia machine and equipment, among others. With regard to appropriate decontamination of the operating room, both the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) have recommended following current CDC guidance of using EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant from List N.2 A recent article on perioperative infection control also made specific evidence-based recommendations such as designating and maintaining clean and dirty areas, treating operating rooms with UV-C, using longer staff shifts, performing one case in each OR daily, with terminal cleaning after each case.6",

            "text": "Amidst these discussions, less attention has been given to whether implementing a pause to allow removal ofaerosolized particles should be widely deployed in operating and procedure rooms. In this area, both the ASA and APSF state that \u201cUpon patient leaving the room, entry should be delayed until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove aerosolized infectious particles.\u201d7 During the pandemic, some hospitals have instituted this \u201cpause\u201d after intubation and extubation;however, there are several questions to consider before recommending widespread adoption of this practice. As with any improvement changes, local barriers to implementation exist, as well as consideration benefits and consequences. In the shortterm, initiating this change may not pose significant challenges and may be advantageous. While elective surgeries are being canceled, or postponed, certain hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers may have the opportunity to initiate this change without affecting their case efficiency. Waiting after intubation and extubation also reassures the operating room staff that safety is a priority. Furthermore, this precautionary measure may reduce the usage of personal protective equipment. Another consideration is whether to implement this practice in only COVID-19 or PUI patients or expand it to all patients, given the known risk of asymptomatic viral shedding. Until widespread rapid testing becomes available, some may consider a pause for all cases, which affects operating room efficiency. Indeed, challenges to sustaining a pause for COVID patients in the longterm include effects on operating room delays and efficiency. Although operating rooms with more rapid ACH rates could be selectively utilized for these patients over others, this option is not always available to institutions or specific sites with low ACH rates. For instance, procedures such as interventional radiology cases can typically only be performed in certain fluoroscopy-enabled suites, where the ACH rate may be suboptimal for rapid turnover. We hope that this analysis assists other institutions to use a quantitative approach to determining a postaerosol pause if desired. These considerations are particularly relevant as hospitals and health systems consider the next phase of readjusting to the \u201cnew normal,\u201d rescheduling canceled elective surgeries, and adopting a long-term sustainable approach to caring for COVID-19 patients.",
