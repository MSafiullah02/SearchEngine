Patients in ICUs are almost universally compromised either by virtue of their underlying disease or by virtue of the invasive devices utilized to support and monitor them. Patients are termed immunocompromised or immunosuppressed if their defect specifically involves immune response. Often, patients who have deficient inflammatory response (e.g., neutropenia) are grouped into the category of immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, although technically they have a different category of deficient host response. Patients in ICUs are often immunosuppressed as a result of their underlying disease, therapy, or nutritional status.

Inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms can also be disrupted by drugs. Cytotoxic drugs, for instance, can reduce neutrophil number and function. Certain monoclonal antibodies can destroy lymphocyte populations or interfere with cytokine attachment to receptor sites. Some agents such as corticosteroids have multiple effects on neutrophils, lymphocytes, and soluble factors. Infections may result from organisms that are usually not pathogenic, but become opportunistic because of poor host defense mechanisms. Opportunistic infections are defined as those that occur with enhanced frequency or severity in a specific patient population compared with a normal patient population. Pneumocystis jiroveci, for example, never causes disease in immunologically normal individuals but can cause frequent episodes of pneumonia in certain immunosuppressed patients. Candida can cause mild mucosal disease in normal patients receiving antibacterial drugs but causes more frequent and more severe mucositis when patients have impaired cell-mediated immunity.",

In fact, the risk for opportunistic infection in patients with HIV infection can be assessed by clinical laboratories with a high degree of accuracy by measuring the number of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes.5 The susceptibility of cancer patients to opportunistic bacterial and Candida infections can be assessed by measuring the number of circulating neutrophils.7, 10, 11 The predisposition of patients with certain congenital immunodeficiencies can be assessed by measuring serum immunoglobulin levels.12 Unfortunately, however, for a large number of immunodeficiencies, no objective laboratory measures have been validated as predicting the risk of infection. Moreover, laboratory measures must be interpreted in context. CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have great prognostic value in patients with HIV infection but not in most other patient populations; neutrophil counts are relevant in all patient populations, but low counts are associated with disrupted mucosal surfaces compared with those with intact mucosa.

            "text": "\n1.Diseases may present with subtle symptoms and signs, and patients are predisposed to deteriorate precipitously.Because immunocompromised patients may lack inflammatory and/or immunologic mediators, the clinical manifestations of infections are often less prominent and less impressive than immunocompetent patients with similar complications. Thus clinicians must recognize that even subtle changes in skin color, catheter site appearance, chest radiograph, or abdominal examination may warrant an aggressive diagnostic evaluation and early institution of broad-spectrum empiric therapy. Although all ICU patients demand prompt attention and vigorous diagnostic and therapeutic management, many types of immunosuppression can be associated with especially precipitous clinical deterioration despite their innocuous presentation.\n2.Fever is not invariably present when patients are infected.Although fever is not invariably present in any patient population with infection, immunosuppressed patients are notorious for developing infection in the absence of fever. Thus infection must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis among patients with afebrile syndromes that might not appear to be infectious. Conversely, patients with fever may not have infection: Fever may be a manifestation of the underlying disease, an allergic response to a drug, or an underlying neoplastic or collagen vascular disease.\n3.Diagnostic evaluation needs to be prompt and definitive.As indicated earlier, patients with life-threatening infection may present with subtle symptoms and signs that progress rapidly: these early manifestations merit aggressive attempts to define the anatomy of the lesion and the causative microbial pathogen. Because the spectrum of potential pathogens includes a wide array of microorganisms (e.g., viruses, fungi, protozoa, or bacteria), clinicians must be certain that appropriate specimens are obtained and the appropriate microbiologic and histologic tests are ordered to identify common, as well as uncommon or unusual, pathogens. Invasive diagnostic techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue biopsies should be performed with less hesitancy than in immunologically normal patients. Patients often have enhanced risk factors for invasive procedures, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor deficiencies, or compromised organ function. However, the benefit of definitive diagnosis often outweighs these risks when the procedures are performed by experienced operators.\n4.The threshold for initiating broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be low.Because patients can deteriorate rapidly and because they are susceptible to such a wide array of microbial pathogens, clinicians should have little hesitation in instituting empiric antimicrobial therapy. This therapy must be directed at the full range of bacterial, fungal, viral, protozoal, and helminthic infections to which patients are predisposed. This therapy should be administered promptly, preferably within an hour of suspecting an infectious process. Clinicians should initiate comprehensive regimens: antimicrobial agents can be discontinued or reduced when culture results and clinical events clarify the scenario.\n5.Foreign bodies and infectious foci should be addressed.Patients may need careful imaging to be certain that they do not have an obstructed viscus or localized collection that should be drained. Such imaging is appropriate even when signs or symptoms are unimpressive. Similarly, patients often have multiple intravascular catheters that may need to be removed, as discussed in Chapter 51.\n6.\nConsideration should be given to augmenting the immune or inflammatory response.There may be opportunities to augment immunologic or inflammatory responses by administering pharmacologic or biologic agents such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or intravenous immunoglobulin. 12, 13, 14, 15 Eliminating immunosuppressive drugs or reducing the dose can also improve the patient's prognosis.\n7.Efficacy and toxicity of therapy should be assessed serially.ICU patients characteristically require attentive monitoring to assure the adequacy and safety of therapy. Immunocompromised patients often have multiple prior and concurrent insults to their renal and hepatic function, and they often receive multiple drugs that can produce drug-drug interactions. Thus monitoring the pharmacokinetics and assessing potential toxicities are especially important in these patient populations. Moreover, because response to therapy may be less robust than in immunocompetent patients, antigen titers or PCR titers, as well as serial imaging studies, can be important to assure the adequacy of the management plan. Therapy must often be continued longer than in immunologically normal patients.\n\n",

The absolute neutrophil count is not the only factor that determines susceptibility, however, because some patients with cyclic neutropenias, drug-induced neutropenias, or HIV-induced neutropenias, for example, are not nearly as susceptible to infection as are cancer patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. Other important contributors to susceptibility, in addition to the absolute neutrophil count, are the duration of neutropenia, the functional capability of neutrophils, the integrity of physical barriers such as the skin and gastrointestinal mucosa, the patient's microbiologic environment (endogenous and exogenous flora), and the status of other immune mechanisms. For example, a patient with vancomycin-induced neutropenia during therapy for a staphylococcal infection may not develop any complications if the neutropenia is brief and defense mechanisms are otherwise intact. A patient with HIV-induced neutropenia may have prolonged or even lifelong neutrophil counts below 500/\u03bcL yet suffer few serious bacterial complications.14 The presence of intact physical defense barriers is a major difference compared with cancer patients, whose skin and mucous membranes are disrupted by cytotoxic therapy in which the skin and gastrointestinal tracts are portals of entry for infections that are not controlled by diminished host immunologic or inflammatory defenses. Thus the patient with HIV infection is usually at a much lower risk for a bacterial infection than is a cancer patient, despite a comparable neutrophil count.",

Anaerobic bacteria and aerobic gram-positive cocci were recognized less commonly. Aerobic gram-negative bacillus infections were also associated with a poorer outcome than infections from gram-positive cocci. Given the spectrum of pathogenic organisms that were seen in that era, combination therapy was usually advocated.11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 A number of reasons were proposed to justify combination therapy: (1) broad coverage of potential pathogens; (2) prevention of emergence of resistance; and (3) synergy. In general, these principles are reasonable concepts on which to base a preference for using combination therapeutic regimens. However, no study unequivocally demonstrated that combination therapy provided better outcomes than did monotherapy, assuming that both study arms contained drugs that had activity against the causative organism. In addition, predicting synergy proved difficult.25\n",

Regular physical examination is necessary to identify sites that merit more focused investigation: With impaired inflammatory response, findings on examination may be subtle. Knowledge of the specific immunologic defect is important so that when cultures of blood, sputum, urine, or other appropriate body fluids or body sites are performed, special microbiologic approaches can be used to detect viruses, fungi, helminths, protozoa, and bacteria. Imaging studies are also important because intra-abdominal, intrathoracic, intracerebral, or musculoskeletal processes can be clinically subtle and may not be associated with identifiable organisms in the bloodstream. A growing array of antigen, nucleic acid, and gene detection systems including polymerase chain reaction and microarray gene assays are being investigated to facilitate diagnosis. Some antigen or nucleic acid detection systems for blood or other body fluids can be useful for detecting cryptococcus, histoplasma, hepatitis B and C, HIV, mycobacteria, pneumococci, and Legionella. Some of these approaches, despite their promising initial reports, are not yet clinically practical because of their level of sensitivity, specificity, or the cost or expertise required to perform them adequately.",

Ceftazidime is an option chosen by some, but its poor activity against gram-positive cocci has caused some clinicians to use other agents.18 Intensivists must recognize, however, that these monotherapy regimens may not be appropriate in an ICU. Patients in ICUs, by definition, are either unstable hemodynamically or have a potentially life-threatening process such as diffuse pneumonia or are \u201cfragile\u201d because of concurrent processes. Thus combination regimens are preferred by many authorities in ICU settings, even though no study clearly documents superior outcomes from such combination regimens. The decade that started in 2000 is an era when microbial resistance is becoming an increasingly important problem for many types of bacteria including aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes, as well as aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Multiple drug empiric regimens are more likely than monotherapy regimens to include an agent with activity against the offending pathogen(s). Thus in a situation in an ICU when failure to use an active drug is more likely to be lethal than in other settings, and when enhanced potency is a logical goal, combination therapy is prudent as an initial management strategy. Thus adding vancomycin or linezolid or daptomycin for better gram-positive coverage, adding a quinolone for better gram-negative bacillus coverage, and adding metronidazole to cefepime would be prudent in this patient population pending results of initial diagnostic studies. Of note, however, is that although this strategy is logical, no study has shown convincingly that such an approach improves outcome.22\n",

If a patient is hemodynamically unstable and fails to respond promptly to fluid administration, it is prudent to remove the line in case an infected catheter is the source of the sepsis. Failure to remove the foreign body in this situation probably increases the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. Should blood cultures become positive and should the suspicion be high that the catheter is the source, antibacterial therapy may be successful in some settings (e.g., if the pathogen is a bacteria that is relatively sensitive to antibacterial therapy), thus avoiding the need to remove the catheter.

Antipneumocystis prophylaxis is, in contrast, highly effective in susceptible populations. Prophylaxis for CMV is highly effective in well-defined, high-risk patients (e.g., some recipients of organ transplants who are either sero positive for CMV or who are seronegative but received a graft from a seropositive donor).2, 4, 49 Strategies that reduce the period of immunologic susceptibility (e.g., reduce the duration of neutropenia), such as adding G-CSF to a regimen or reducing the intensity of chemotherapeutic regimens, are promising.

The CD4+ T lymphocyte cell number is a useful marker for predicting the occurrence of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV infection.5, 9 This relationship of CD4+ T lymphocyte count to the occurrence of opportunistic infection continues to be as valid in the era of HAART as it was before the licensing of the first antiretroviral agent, zidovudine, in 1987.60, 61, 62\nFigure 54-2\ndemonstrates the typical relationship of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts to the occurrence of opportunistic infections. Knowledge of this relationship permits the focusing of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic management. For instance, if a patient with HIV infection and a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 700 cells/\u03bcL presents with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, the diagnostic evaluation and empiric antimicrobial regimen should focus on S. pneumoniae; H. influenzae; Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia organisms, as well as common community-acquired viruses. In contrast, if the same patient had a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 50 cells/\u03bcL, the evaluation and empiric regimen would focus on pneumocystosis and CMV, although the previously mentioned processes that occur at high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts can also occur at lower CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. Keeping in mind that CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are useful predictors of susceptibility to infection is important, but they are not perfect. Occasionally, patients will develop opportunistic infections at \u201cuncharacteristically\u201d high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. For instance, 5% to 10% of cases of pneumocystosis occur at CD4+ T lymphocyte counts greater than 200 cells/\u03bcL.61 Clinical parameters can provide additional clues; for example, oral candidiasis, a previous opportunistic infection, a prior episode of pneumonia, or high viral load are independent risk factors for the occurrence of Pneumocystis jiroveci carinii pneumonia (PCP), and logically for other infections as well.9\n",

In some areas of the country, such as the Ohio River Valley and Indianapolis, histoplasmosis is as common as pneumocystosis in causing diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.64 In the southwestern United States, coccidioidomycosis must be recognized as a cause of pulmonary infiltrates. The clinical presentations of tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and other processes such as CMV can be clinically indistinguishable from PCP.

In those situations their management ordinarily requires no extraordinary measures, with two exceptions. First, the staff must be fully aware of how HIV is transmitted, the danger of injuries resulting from sharp objects, and the procedure for managing injuries involving sharp objects contaminated with blood or other biologic fluids from infected or potentially infected patients.65 Second, drug interactions involving drugs used during procedures and certain antiretroviral drugs can have important clinical consequences.66, 67 Many of the protease inhibitors and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that are now the backbone of antiretroviral therapy can inhibit or enhance the metabolism of drugs that depend on the cytochrome P450 system. Thus the half-lives of certain analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotics can be prolonged in HIV-infected patients who are taking ritonavir, for example. This pharmacokinetic effect is also relevant for a host of other therapeutic agents used in the ICU and may affect their efficacy or safety.

The median time to improvement in clinical variables is 4 to 8 days; therefore, changes in therapy are probably not warranted before 5 to 10 days. At that point the accuracy of the diagnosis should be reassessed: Consideration should be given to repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy to determine if CMV, fungi, mycobacteria, or a nosocomial bacterial process is present. Noninfectious processes such as congestive heart failure or tumor (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma) must also be considered. If pneumocystosis is the only causative process that can be identified, corticosteroids should be added to the regimen if they have not been already. Whether switching from one antipneumocystis agent to another or whether adding a second agent is helpful has not been determined by clinical trials. Some human pneumocystosis isolates are resistant to sulfonamides, but such testing is available only in a few research centers. Most clinicians add parenteral pentamidine to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Parenteral trimetrexate or clindamycin-primaquine could be used as salvage regimens as well.

Thus evaluating hypotension in this patient population requires a comprehensive and thorough approach. A differential diagnosis of the major causes is shown in Table 54-6\n.

Identifying potentially infected patients early and placing them in appropriate isolation until their tuberculosis status is fully examined is important.

This risk can be substantially reduced by education, by strict monitoring for compliance with universal precautions, and by having proper equipment. Almost all HIV transmission in an occupational setting occurs as a result of injuries involving sharp instruments (e.g., needles, scalpels). The risk of such injuries is about one case of HIV transmission per 250 injuries, but the likelihood of transmission in an individual accident depends on the amount of viremia at the time of the accident (late-stage patients generally have more circulating virus than do early-stage patients) and the nature of the accident. Most authorities recommend immediate prophylaxis if a significant injury occurs involving an HIV-infected patient. Considerable debate exists over the optimal choice of drugs and the optimal duration of therapy, but it is clear that initiating therapy within a period of hours rather than days is best. Many authorities now advocate a HAART regimen for any situation when the patient and health care provider determine that therapy is appropriate, and continue that for 4 to 6 weeks.",

In urban areas of the United States, 60% to 70% of the population is seropositive for CMV, and thus 60% to 70% of the transplant recipients will have latent infection that could potentially be reactivated. Some CMV seronegative patients acquire primary infections from a CMV-infected organ or from CMV-infected blood or blood products. A few CMV seropositive individuals develop superimposed CMV disease from CMV acquired through a seropositive donor.
