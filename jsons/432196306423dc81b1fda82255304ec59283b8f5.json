Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM 10 , PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 and NH 3 ) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM 10 and PM 2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO 2 (-52.68%) and CO (-Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality.",

As per the estimation of the World Bank (World Bank 2016; Lim et al. 2012) welfare expenditure is equivalent to about 8% of national GDP in the developing countries. In order to minimize the health burden due to air pollution the Central government and the government of NCT Delhi, have imposed several regulation measures since long as per international guidelines. For instance, CPCB ENVIS (2012) identified 17 categories of highly polluting industries with restricted operation within the jurisdiction of the NCT Delhi; implementation of strict emission standard for vehicles, renovating complete municipal transportation to CNG fuel, converting coal-based power plants to natural gas (CPCB 2011), ban on entrance of weighty vehicles during peak hours, odd-even car trial system (Kumar et al. 2017) and many more. In spite of these efforts, air pollution level is not reduced considerably in Delhi.",

Due to the contagion of COVID-19, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India from March 24th for three weeks up to 14th of April and later extended up to 3rd May. By this nationwide lockdown almost all industrial activities and mass transportation have been prohibited. As a result, the pollution level in 88 cities across the country drastically reduced down only after four days of commencing lockdown event according to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 official data from the CPCB.

In this course, Integral Air Pollution Index (IAPI) has been developed particularly for the metropolis of Russia (Bezuglaya et al. 1993) . Later on in 1999 PSI was renamed as Air Quality Index (AQI) by the US EPA (1999) incorporating few other pollutants parameters. Subsequently, several other indices have come into force like Aggregate Air Quality Index, (AQI) (Kyrkilis et al. 2007 (Kumar and Goyal 2013) are some of the recent development. However, among the commonly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 used air quality indices there is no unanimously accepted methodology does exist fit for all circumstances (Stieb et al. 2005; Maynard and Coster 1999) . Of late technological advancement along with information technology collection and compilation real-time of site-specific air pollution data is in practice throughout the world. In India the attempt to quantify integrated air quality started much later only after 1984 in name of National Air Quality Monitoring Programme. Up to date only few handful studies (Agharkar 1982; Swami and Tyagi 1999; Gurjar et al. 2008; Beig et al. 2010a and 2010b etc.) have successfully attempted to quantify and report air quality for megacities of the country. However, eclipsing and ambiguity are frequent to many of the indices used in those studies and there is found considerable discrepancy among air quality professed by the indices and real air quality. In this direction, in place of additive and multiplicative indices developed earlier the CPCB (2014) have come up with a new revised National Air Quality Index (NAQI) derived from Maximum operator approach in an attempt to remove uncertainty and eclipsing. In this regard, the CPCB has also notified a fresh set of Indian National Air Quality Standards (INAQS) (http://www.cpcb.nic.in). In the present work NAQI is used for interim estimation of air quality of the megacity Delhi amidst the lockdown period.",

Consequently, quantitative appraisal of air pollution desires to be carried out so as to understand the upshot of lockdown measures on air quality particularly when there is a need to implement such alternative control actions. The present study is an effort in this direction to assess the usefulness of the lockdown as an alternative strategy for diminution of air pollution level in NCT Delhi. The objectives of the present study is (i) to compare the atmospheric pollutant concentrations in Delhi during the pre J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 and during lockdown periods, (ii) to quantify the integrated air quality due to the implementation of lockdown regulation during Lockdown period and (iii) to unveil the level of major pollutant concentration in the past few years during the same window period. Focusing on the NCT of Delhi, the study is thought to be a conceivable addition to the scientific community and policy makers not only to assess the impacts of lockdown on air quality, but also its efficiency as an easy alternative action plans for upgrading in air quality of NCT Delhi with public involvement in upcoming years.",

The National Capital Territory (NCT) Delhi is the second leading megacity in the world (The World's Cities in 2018 , Data Booklet, United Nations, 2018 and the largest urban agglomeration in India with 1.68 crore residents exhibiting a decadal growth rate of 21% and density of 11297person/km 2 (Census 2011; http://census2011.co.in). NCT Delhi occupies an area about 1485 km 2 which lies between geo-coordinate 28\u00b024'17''N to 28053'00\"N and 76\u00b050'24\"E to 77\u00b020'37\"E ( Figure 1 ). Geographically the megacity is located within the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain region with an altitude range of 198 m to 220m above msl and surrounded by lesser Himalaya in the north, peninsular region in the south, hilly region in the east and Great Indian Desert in the west (Sahay 2018; Yadav et al. 2017) . NCT Delhi has dual status as a city and a state incorporating Kanjhawla Block, MehrauliBlock,Najafgarh Block and Shahadra Block. The Monsoon (Jun-Sept), short Post-monsoon (Oct-Nov), Winter (Dec-Feb) and Pre-monsoon (March-May) . Temperature ranges between 4\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C in winter and 42\u00b0 C to 48\u00b0C in summer (Kumar et al. 2017 ). More than 80% of the total annual precipitation occurs during the monsoon months (Perrino et al. 2011) . A momentous proportion (about 90%) of the population working in NCT Delhi residing in urban areas, which is much higher than the nationwide average of 31.16% (SAD 2014). About 6.93 million registered vehicles was on roads during 2011 in Delhi which is the highest in the country and it is further expected to increase as much as 25.6 million by 2030 (Kumar et al. 2017) . NCT Delhi's existing road length is 33198 km with about 864 km signalized road and 418 blinkers traffic intersections (NCR 2013; GoD 2016). ",

The sub-indices for entity pollutants at a monitoring station has been calculated based on 24-hrs mean (8hrs for CO and O 3 ) data and health breakpoint range (CPCB 2015) . However, all the seven pollutants may possibly not monitor at all the stations simultaneously. Largely NAQI is measured if data does exist for at least three pollutants and must include PM 2.5 or PM 10 within the three. Otherwise, data are regarded as inadequate for NAQI calculation. Likewise, at least 16 hours' data is required for sub-index calculation and air quality of a pollutant is the sub-index value of that pollutant. Currently CPCB also provide real time NAQI rooted in a web-based system. The web-based system is programmed for the continuously monitoring stations whereas for manual monitoring stations an NAQI calculator has developed to obtain the NAQI value.",

The maximum concentration of PM 10 was during 2017 and that of PM 2.5 was during 2017 counting as high as 398.80\u03bcg/m 3 and 185.90\u03bcg/m 3 respectively.

The results again are a sign that implementation of lockdown may lead to substantial improvement of the air quality and could be put into practice as an alternative measure for pollution reduction. This results in gathering of local and transported pollutants and augmentation of pollution level during the season. Therefore, in order to consider lockdown as an alternative policy measure once or twice a year in a long-distance race, examination of seasonal variation of pollutant concentration with respect to regional meteorological conditions is also necessary.

The daily (24hrs) average concentration of PM 2.5 is highly correlated with the daily average concentration of SO 2 (r = 0.59), NO 2 (r = 0.35) as well as 8hrs average concentration of CO (r = 0.45). Likewise, the daily average concentration of PM 10 is also strongly correlated with the daily average concentration of SO 2 (r = 0.47), NO 2 (r = 0.46), NH 3 (r = 0.30) as well as 8hrs average concentration of CO (r = 0.39). This visibly implies that the augmented control of regional transport activity compared to local contributions in the mega city is the key responsible factor for the reduction of pollutants concentration ) as during the lockdown period the regional transportation has Mega cities of India are often listed within the world's topmost polluted cities that exceed the ambient air quality standard and therefore a comprehensive account of air quality improvement in the megacity Delhi has international relevance of its own. Lockdown measures in different parts of the world fortunately have brought opportunity to rationalize human impact on the environment. Therefore results of the present article may help to rethink how far we are responsible for our misery. It may also help to consider whether lockdown would be an unconventional measure for restoring the environment and providing a quality ecosystem to the urban people. Because in urban areas in aim of fulfilling the target economic growth often the sources of ecosystem services are ignored due to which people undergo health threat. The dreadful virus in one hand threatening our life and on the other hand the mechanism of the environmental restoration process is also going on. Hence, global concern for air pollution has lead to draw significant attention for analyzing air pollution in the course of the pandemic. In",

Study conducted by Watts and Kommenda (2020) also reported a temporary cut of air pollutants amid industrial shutdown in this period. Cadotte (2020) also identified diminishing air pollutants over the major cities of the world where the outbreak of COVID 19 is very strong. Ogen (2020) found a strong linkage between the concentration of NO 2 and fatal outcome caused by COVID-19.Study of Coccia (2020) reveals that the acceleration and vast dispersion of COVID-19in north Italy province capitals has a high connection with air pollution particularly PM 10 and Ozone. There are quite a few other study concerning changes in air quality during the lockdown amid SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with special reference to many areas throughout the globe listed in table 5.Therefore, the result outlined in the present swat is not an isolated one as improvement of air quality due to lockdown is also evident throughout the world. Regions with poor air quality are associated with higher mortality rate. Lockdown in some cities led to upgrading in air quality and lessened premature deaths. There is a considerable relationship between air pollution and COVID-19infection -Isaifan (2020) -Wang and Su (2020) Accelerated transmissions of COVID-19are principally by means of \"air pollution-to-human transmission\" rather than \"human-to-human transmission\".",

Delhi is internationally recognized for its extreme pollution level. Among the selected pollutants PM 10 and PM 2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction followed by NO 2 , CO and NH 3 . In compare to the past three year average concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 has decreased by about -57% and -33% respectively. On a contrary there is a slight increase in O 3 concentration which is expected to be primarily due to the decrease in the concentration of NOx and particulate matter. Moreover, as anticipated, a considerable reduction in NAQI is observed during the window period of lockdown throughout guideline of lockdown has been obeying, the air quality improvement is found high there.",

The locations of the air quality monitoring stations are Reference map of the NCT-Delhi showing administrative units and the air pollution monitoring stations used for the present analysis 3.0 Air pollution reduction policies across the country and in NCT Delhi To cope up with the ever rising pollution beyond permissible limit in the NCT of Delhi, different policy interventions have come up time to time. In this direction the MoEFCC (http://moef.nic.in/) of the Central Government works as the nodal agency in co-ordination with the UNEP for the preclusion & manage of pollution and protection of environment. Along with MoEFCC, the CPCB, (https://www.cpcb.nic.in/) works as a statutory organization which functions under the Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act 1981 (amended 1987). CPCB also extends technical support to the MoEFCC under the proviso of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The Delhi Pollution Control Board (DPCB) is another organization functions at the state. 4 landmark strategy to protect environment in India are-The Air (Prevention & Control of (2006). Further, in NCT Delhi there are a range of vehicle emission control strategies executed by the government over the decades. These include beginning of unleaded petrol (1998), catalytic converter for fare cars (1995), lessening of sulfur in diesel (2000) and cutback of benzene content in fuels (2000); CNG for commercial transport vehicles (2001) (Rizwan et al. 2017; Gulia et al. 2018). Apart from these in NCT Delhi first Industrial Policy has initiated in 1982 and afterward, a second Industrial policy (2010-2021) has introduced by the Department of Industries, Government of Delhi (Rizwan et al. 2017). In January 2016, the GoI has implemented Euro IV emission standard for petrol and Euro VI norm for diesel. The BS-VI standard will be put into practice for new and existing vehicles by April 2020 and 2021 respectively (Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, GoI, 2016: A draft notification https://morth.nic.in/). The GoI also targeted to develop 6 to 7 million Plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles (PEVs) on roads by 2020 (Sheppard et al. 2016). The National Bio-fuels Policy have aimed to convert at least 20% of the diesel and petrol (gasoline) based engines into bio-diesel and bio-ethanol by 2017 (Purohit and Dhar 2015). The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), 2019 aimed at reducing PMby 30% nationwide (MoEFC, 2019). Besides the government efforts, there are several other institutions that work parallely to reduce air pollution in the megacity like-Centre for Science and Environment, CEC (https://www.cseindia.org/); The Energy and Resources Institute, TERI (https://www.teriin.org/); the Indian Association for Air Pollution Control (Delhi Chapter) (http://www.iaapc.in/) etc. 4.0 Materials and Methods 4.1 Materials used J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 In order to assess air quality status of NCT Delhi during the lockdown period, data form thirty four air quality monitoring stations covering different regions of the megacity has been taken into consideration (Figure 1).The monitoring organization for these air quality monitoring stations includes CPCB (manual ambient air quality monitoring, MAAQM); CPCB (continuous ambient air quality monitoring, CAAQM); DPCC (Delhi Pollution Control Committee) and SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), IITM (Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology), Pune. The daily or hourly concentration of seven air pollutants including Particulate Matters (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2 ), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ),Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O 3 ) and Ammonia (NH 3 ) have been obtained from the CPCB online portal for air quality data dissemination (https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboardall/caaqm-landing). CPCB provides data quality assurance or quality control (QA/QC) programs by defining rigorous protocols for the sampling, analysis and calibration.",

For the traffic and industrial background stations the magnitude of decline of PM 2.5 is as high as about -62.61% and -59.74%respectively. Other pollutants that have shown considerable variation between pre and during lockdown are NO 2 (-52.68%) and CO (-30.35%). However, for SO 2 (-17.97%), and NH 3 (-12.33%) the reduction have counted very low in comparison to the others and the trend also not evidencing prominent definite trend (Figure 2c, 2g). 8 hrs average daily maximum concentration of O 3 (+0.78% overall variation) in the study period shows negligible increase with insignificant rising trend(Figure 2f). In this case, considering that April to August in Indian subcontinent is the usual high O 3 period (Goraiet al. 2017) due to the increase in insolation is quite feasible. Important to note that, the concentration of O 3 increases especially in the industrial and transport dominated locations (>10% increase) (Table 4). The cause for this increase in O 3 concentration, especially in the industrial and transport dominated areas is the decrease of nitrogen oxide (NO) which leads to lowering of the O 3 consumption (titration, NO+O 3 =NO 2 +O 2 ) and causes an increase in O 3 concentrations. The overall air quality reduction as evident from NAQI value for past-lockdown and during-lockdown(Figure 4h) counted about -60.95% with the net reduction counting -113.36(Table 2). For the transportation and industrial location the air quality have improved up to -59.45% (net reduction in NAQI: -128.0) and -52.92 (Net reduction in NAQI: -103.93) respectively. This is a clear indication that a substantial improvement of the air quality could be expected if strict implementation of air quality control measures like lockdown is put into practice. Trend",

About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31%reductions in NAQI are observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern regions of the NCT Delhi respectively.

In urban areas NO 2 and CO is mainly emitted from combustion practice by and large from road traffic, particularly diesel and to a smaller degree gasoline, vehicles, manufacturing industry and power plants. During this lockdown period all of these sectors closed their functioning and thereby resulted in the decrease of pollutants like NO 2 and CO. In industrial locations average concentrations of NO 2 and CO have decreased as much as -45.99% and -21.43% respectively. Whereas, in traffic dominated locations the concentration of the two pollutants namelyNO 2 and CO have decreased as much as -50.61 and -36.84% respectively. Status of NO 2 concentration in pre-lockdown and during lockdown period over Status of CO concentration in pre-lockdown and during lockdown period over NCT Delhi Finally, the concentration levels of O 3 noticeably increase during the lockdown period in the mega city Delhi (Figure 8) as a result of three potential collective reasons. First, the lessening of NOx (Appendix 1) as a result of lockdown may result urban O 3 to bump up, contrasting to the behavior at the rural area where largely NOx concentration is limited (Monks et al. 2015). Second: The dwindle of Nitrogen Oxide (NO) diminish the O3 utilization (titration, NO+O 3 = NO 2 +O 2 ), and thereby causes an augment of O 3 concentrations.
