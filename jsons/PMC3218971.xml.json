In the United States alone there are approximately 190,600 cases of ALI/ARDS with a 40% mortality rate, amounting to 75,000 deaths annually [2]. Significant ongoing morbidity, including pulmonary, neuromuscular, cognitive and psychiatric sequelae, is seen in 50 to 70% of ALI/ARDS survivors, and the financial burden on society is considerable [1,3]. There are no specific therapies for ALI/ARDS, and management remains supportive, focusing on protective mechanical ventilation strategies [4], restrictive intravenous fluid management approaches [5], and rescue strategies such as prone positioning [6] or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [7] for severely hypoxemic patients. These issues underline the need to consider nonconventional therapeutic approaches.",

The distal lung epithelium is selectively accessible via the tracheal route of administration, allowing targeting of the pulmonary epithelium [9]. The pulmonary vasculature is also relatively accessible, as the entire cardiac output must transit this circulation. Antibodies that bind antigens selectively expressed on the pulmonary endothelial surface can be complexed to gene vectors to facilitate selective targeting following intravenous administration [10]. It is also possible to use gene-based strategies to target other cells central to the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, such as leukocytes and fibroblasts [11]. Furthermore, gene-therapy-based approaches offer the potential to selectively target different phases of the injury and repair process. The potential to target specific aspects of the injury and repair processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fibrosis, fibrinolysis, coagulopathy and oxidative stress with these approaches is also clear.",

Advantages include their ease of production, the high efficiency at which they can infect the pulmonary epithelium [14,16] and that they can deliver relatively large transgenes. A disadvantage of adenoviruses is their immunogenicity, particularly in repeated doses [14]. Newer adenoviral vectors, in which much of the immunogenicity has been removed, hold promise [17]. While adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in the absence of epithelial damage is relatively inefficient [18], this may be less of a problem in ALI/ARDS that is characterized by widespread epithelial damage.",

A substantial proportion of the human population has been exposed to AAVs but the clinical effects are unknown. AAV vectors have a good safety profile, and are less immunogenic compared with other viruses, although antibodies do develop against AAV capsid proteins that can compromise repeat administration. AAV vectors can insert genes at a specific site on chromosome 19. The packaging capacity of the virus is limited to 4.7 kb, restricting the size of the transgene that can be used. AAVs are less efficient in transducing cells than adenoviral vectors. Successful AAV vector gene transfer has been demonstrated in multiple lung cell types including lung progenitor cells, in both normal and naphthalene-induced ALI lungs [20]. AAV serotypes have specific tissue tropisms, due to different capsid proteins that bind to specific cell membrane receptors. AAV-5 [21] and AVV-6 [22] exhibit enhanced tropism for the pulmonary epithelium [21,22]. AAVs can transduce nondividing cells and result in long-lived transgene expression. AAV vectors have been used in clinical trials in cystic fibrosis patients, underlining their safety profile [23,24].",

During subsequent transcription, the sequence generates an oligonucleotide with a tight hairpin turn that is processed into siRNA. shRNAs have reduced lung injury in animal models [35,36]. Decoy oligonucleotides are double-stranded DNA molecules of 20 to 28 nucleotides, which bind to specific transcription factors to reduce expression of targeted genes, and have been successfully used in animal models [37,38].",

Much research has been devoted to searching and characterizing both naturally occurring [71] and engineered capsid variants from mammalian species [72]. Capsid protein modification has also been used to enhance tissue specificity [70]. Envelope protein pseudotyping involves encapsulating the modified genome from one virus, such as simian immunodeficiency virus, with envelope proteins from another virus, such as vesicular stomatitic virus. This encapsulation can enhance the therapeutic potential of viral vectors, by combining the advantages of one viral genome (for example, bigger payload or site-specific integration) with the tissue tropism of another virus.",

The choice of lipid influences expression efficiency by enhancing release of the genetic material within the target cell [73,74]. Targeting peptides increases transfection efficiency by directing the lipid to a particular cell membrane or cell type [31]. Physical methods of plasmid delivery such as electroporation [60] and ultrasound can enhance gene transfer by bringing the plasmid DNA into closer proximity with the cell membrane and/or causing temporary disruption of the cell membrane. Other physical methods can also be used to increase in vivo gene transfer, including pressurized vascular delivery, laser, magnetic fields and gene gun delivery.

Tetracycline is rapidly metabolized and cleared from the body, making it an ideal drug to control gene expression. However, the potential for an activator such as tetracycline to modulate the lung injury should be borne in mind. New-generation transactivators, with no basal activity and increased sensitivity, have now been developed [82]. In an ARDS context, conditional regulation of gene expression by the combined use of a lung-specific promoter and the tetracycline-dependent gene expression system may be a useful approach [83].",

Novel nebulization technologies, which facilitate the delivery of large quantities of undamaged vector to the distal lung, demonstrate considerable promise in this regard [9]. Alternative approaches to spatial targeting include targeting specific receptors that are plentiful on the target cell to increase transfection efficiency. An interesting development in this regard is the targeting of systemically administered therapies to the pulmonary endothelium using antibodies to proteins expressed preferentially on these cells (Figure 5) [10]. In these studies, the antioxidant enzyme catalase was conjugated with antibodies to the adhesion molecule PECAM, which is widely expressed on pulmonary endothelial cells, and to a nonspecific IgG antibody. The anti-PECAM/catalase conjugate, but not the IgG/catalase conjugate, bound specifically to the pulmonary endothelium and attenuated hydrogen peroxide injury.",

This is supported by increasing evidence from relevant preclinical ARDS models for the efficacy of gene-based therapies that enhance or restore lung epithelial and/or endothelial cell function, strengthen lung defense mechanisms against injury, speed resolution of inflammation and infection, and enhance the repair process following ALI/ARDS. Despite this promising preclinical evidence, the potential for gene based approaches to ALI/ARDS in the clinical setting remains to be realized. Multiple barriers exist to the successful use of gene-based therapies in the lung, which limit the efficacy of these approaches. Future research approaches should focus on overcoming these barriers, by developing more effective and less immunogenic vector delivery systems, developing strategies to focus gene expression on specific injury zones of the lung for defined time periods, and identifying better molecular targets that can take advantage of these potentially very powerful therapeutic approaches.",
