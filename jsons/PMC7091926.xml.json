Risk factors for influenza LRTI include profound lymphopenia, lack of early antiviral treatment and old age.5, 6 Pathogenesis of severe viral LRTI and ARDS is unclear and may include virus-induced pathology or excessive immunopathology.7 Impaired influenza-specific host immune responses are well-established in hematology\u2013oncology patients but surprisingly little is known about the interactions with virus-associated clinical manifestations and outcomes. The recent introduction of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in the human population with limited preexistent immunity provided the opportunity to evaluate the role of innate and adaptive host immune findings in determining virus-specific symptoms and viral clearance among hematology\u2013oncology patients with prolonged viral excretion.",

The institutional review board approved the pre-established study protocol and informed consent forms that were obtained from all subjects. Patients or legal representatives signed informed consent for voluntary study participation and confidentiality. Permission was granted for clinical data collection, blood draw of a research specimen and immunologic studies. Exclusion criteria were patients aged <18 years, patients deemed unfit by the treating physician (for example, owing to severe underlying bleeding disorders, religious background including Jehova\u2019s witnesses, altered mental or emotional status) and patients or legal representatives not wishing to enter the study. Medical records were reviewed for relevant clinical findings, virus-associated symptoms and outcomes. Respiratory specimens were assessed for A(H1N1)pdm09, neuraminidase gene H275Y mutation encoding oseltamivir resistance and other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR and viral culture.8 Pulmonary imaging (chest radiography or computed tomography), bronchoalvolar lavage microbiology results and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimens were evaluated to confirm severe A(H1N1)pdm09-associated LRTI and ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and to exclude concomitant infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) and non-infectious cardiopulmonary causes (lung embolism, pneumothorax or congestive cardiac failure).",

Humoral responses were determined against homologous virus and reference A/California/007/09 vaccine strain using serum duplicate HI tests, turkey erythrocytes and four hemagglutinin units of virus. Seroconversion was defined as a fourfold rise of HI titers and HI titers \u2a7e80 were considered seroprotective. White blood cell differential counts were evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and lymphocyte subsets were quantified by flow cytometry using CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19 and CD56 fluorochrome-labeled antibodies.9 Minimum absolute cell count references were defined for granulocytes (500/mm3), monocytes (100/mm3), lymphocytes (1000/mm3), CD3+CD4+ (560/mm3) T cells, CD3+CD8+ (260/mm3) T cells, CD3\u2212CD16+ and/or CD56+ nature killer (NK) cells (40/mm3) and CD19+ B cells (60/mm3). T-cell counts \u2a7d20% of minimum reference were defined as profound T-cell lymphopenia.10 Defined surrogate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) markers included the combined presence of seroprotective HI titers with CD16+ FcIgG receptor-bearing cytotoxic NK cells and monocytes in blood. The presence of virus-specific T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. In brief, thawed PBMCs were stimulated with conserved peptides derived from the nucleoprotein and M1 protein, live influenza A/Netherlands/602/09 (H1N1)pdm09 virus or reference strain Resvir-9 (H3N2), 1 \u03bcg/ml Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB; Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands), or left untreated.

Dead cell staining excluded cells with non-specific results. SEB was used as a positive control and to monitor functional integrity of T cells. Functional virus-specific T cells were confirmed by duplicate detection of CD3+CD4+CD69+IFN\u03b3+ or CD3+CD8+CD69+IFN\u03b3+ cells,9, 11 excluding profound T-cell lymphopenia. Virus- and SEB-specific T cells were calculated by subtracting CD4+IFN\u03b3+ and IFN\u03b3+CD8+ cell percentages observed after incubation with medium only.",

The six patients developed a wide spectrum of virus-associated symptoms ranging from mild URTI to severe LRTI and ARDS (Figure 1a). Intercurrent pulmonary co-infections and non-infectious cardiopulmonary diagnoses (congestive cardiac failure, pneumothorax) were excluded or effectively treated and did not seem to confound virus-associated measures. Two cases (patients 1 and 2) displayed mild symptoms during the presence of CD8+ T cells (Figure 2a). Mild symptoms of patient 1 completely alleviated in the presence of ADCC markers whereas patient 2 manifested sustained mild bronchitis and recurrent Haemophilus influenzae bronchopneumonia during absence of seroprotective antibodies. Four cases (patients 3, 4, 5 and 6) developed severe viral LRTI during profound CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia (Figures 1a and 2a) and intercurrent combined absence of ADCC markers.

Innate and adaptive host immune responses appear to be major determinants of virus-associated outcome and viral clearance.3, 6, 7 Earlier studies report that undefined lymphopenia increases the risk for prolonged influenza virus excretion5, 6 and that lymphocyte reconstitution is associated with viral clearance.3 Our findings show that prolonged viral excretion more specifically correlated with T-cell lymphopenia. It is generally assumed that T cells induce viral clearance,7 but this has not clearly been demonstrated in human influenza cases. The role of CD8+ T cells has frequently been characterized in influenza animal models but the role of CD4+ T cells remains unclear.12 We confirm that viral clearance occurs during CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell reconstitution in the presence of functional virus-specific T cells (Figure 2a). Viral clearance did not occur during profound CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia (patients 5 and 6) or during profound CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia with a low-level CD8+ T-cell count (patient 2). This observation supports the assumption that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses determine complete viral clearance.12",

Mild symptoms (patients 1 and 2) correlated with a low-level presence of CD8+ T cells even during absence of seroprotective HI titers (patient 2). In contrast, severe viral LRTI (patients 3, 4, 5 and 6) manifested during profound CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia and intercurrent absence of ADCC markers even during the presence of seroprotective HI titers (patients 3 and 4). Patients 3 and 4 developed seroprotective HI titers despite transient profound CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia. High virus-specific Ab titers did not prevent the development of severe viral LRTI and ARDS probably due to intercurrent absence of ADCC effector cells. Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that CD8+ T cells independently mediate clinical protection7, 11 and that ADCC provides additional clinical protection.13",

Four cases (patients 3, 4, 5 and 6) with (transient) profound T-cell lymphopenia and absence of ADCC markers developed severe virus-associated LRTI and ARDS during innate cell reconstitution. Our findings suggest that profound CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia and (transient) absence of ADCC markers may have provided a window of opportunity for the virus to reach lower alveolar compartments and trigger severe immunopathology by the excessive influx of neutrophils and macrophages.14 Timely antiviral treatment is therefore important when protective immune responses are still lacking and early IV zanamivir therapy may benefit patients who are most at risk.15",
