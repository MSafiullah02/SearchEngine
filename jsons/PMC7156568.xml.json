However, a growing number of patients have reported no such exposure to animal markets, suggesting a possible person-to-person spread.2,3 COVID-19 was imported to Tianjin on January 21, 2020. Tianjin Municipal authorities took aggressive measures to improve detection, isolate COVID-19 patients, and trace contacts to minimize opportunities for further transmission in community and institutional settings.4 We summarize some epidemiologic features of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Tianjin during 2020, and we attempt to explore prevention and control measures.",

There were 135 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases (admission data from January 21 to February 24, 2020) in Haihe Hospital of Tianjin. Haihe Hospital of Tianjin is the only designated hospital for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 in Tianjin. Clinically, the disease is divided into 4 types of cases: mild, ordinary, severe, and critical. Mild cases are defined as the cases with mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia manifested through imaging results. Ordinary cases have fever, respiratory symptoms, and others symptoms of viral pneumonia manifested through imaging results. Severe cases meet any 1 of the following: (1) respiratory distress: RR \u2265 30 times/min; (2) fingertip oxygen saturation \u2264 93% under resting state; and (3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2), P/F \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Critical cases meet any 1 of the following: (1) respiratory failure and an artificial airway required for invasive mechanical ventilation; (2) shock; and (3) combining failure of organs, which require intensive care unit monitoring and treatment.",
