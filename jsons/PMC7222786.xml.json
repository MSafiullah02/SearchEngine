Furthermore, cattle and small ruminant herds share alpine pastures during summer season. Chamois, roe deer and red deer are legally selectively hunted in accordance with Italian law (N. 157 of 11/02/1992) and inspected by veterinarians at the wildlife control centres of the area. In autumn 2014, coughing chamois were reported by hunters. In September\u2013October 2014, 191 chamois were legally selectively hunted (11 kids, 61 yearlings, 119 >2 years old). To collect data on respiratory infections, lungs were available only for 14 yearlings, both with and without macroscopic lesions, and for 7 adults with macroscopic lesions. Lung samples were collected and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 1\u20132 weeks in the control centres facility and subsequently transferred to the laboratory at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. Blood samples, collected from major blood vessels or heart clots, were also available for 1 kid, 3 yearlings and 7 adults. Samples were centrifuged and the serum was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further processing.",

Moreover, virus isolation is a diagnostic technique that requires a virus that is able to replicate in cell culture, therefore the sensitivity could be limited. The use of pan-paramyxoviridae primers previously published, especially universal primers for respiroviruses [27], as well as the set-up of a specific RT-PCR have to be considered in respiratory pathogen panels to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and confirm the presence of the novel RV3 RNA in lung samples of chamois.

Nevertheless, the negative results for other viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens could be biased by the storage condition of lung samples (\u221220 \u00b0C) and by an analytical protocol focused on viral isolation. The phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of the novel isolate and reference respirovirus strains showed that ChamoisRV/IT2014 significantly clustered with CRV3 but formed a separated branch. Despite this, we generated a comprehensive dataset of animal RV3 publicly available from GenBank; there were relatively few whole genome sequences available, and no other RV3 sequence clustered with ChamoisRV/IT2014. The nucleotide identity for the ChamoisRV/IT2014 complete genome with respirovirus reference strains, including CRV3, was 80% or below, revealing nucleotide differences higher than the ones observed among genotypes and members of Respirovirus genus [2,28]. The comparison of complete L protein amino acid sequences, representing the current species demarcation criterion for Respirovirus genus [26], shows that ChamoisRV/IT2014 possesses sequence differences from the other respirovirus species. Moreover, although the phylogenetic analysis of ChamoisRV/IT2014 based on M, HN and F genes, used as targets for genetic typing of RV3 [5], confirms the highest nucleotide identity with CRV3, it shows low nucleotide identity for all three genes.",
