This approach, coupled with various population genetic models, is an especially powerful tool for the elucidation of non\u2010random reproductive systems, and thus is most useful in detecting sympatric cryptic species that may not be revealed by examining variation in morphological characters, or in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA markers.",

These entities, while genetically strongly differentiated from each other, exhibited extreme morphological similarity, sharing all of the character states that have been regarded as diagnostic of G. hokouensis. In this paper, we document this extreme example of discrepancy between morphological and genetic divergences, and discuss its taxonomic and evolutionary implications.",

All of these specimens were identified as G. hokouensis on the basis of diagnostic external characters (i.e. internasal as large as following scales; enlarged tubercles present on dorsal surface of body, but absent on limbs; single pair of cloacal spar; male pores only in the preanal region; apical caudal tubercles absent or present but only in proximal portion: Ota 1989). Specimens from each island, except those from Okinawajima, were treated as a single sample on the basis of the assumption that individuals occurring on a small island belong to a single interbreeding population. Because of the large size of Okinawajima (1.192 km2), groups of specimens collected from five localities within this island (each <3 km \u00d7 3 km) were designated as five separate samples for the analysis. Five other samples of G. hokouensis, representing populations from southern Kyushu, the northern Ryukyus, the Amami Group of the central Ryukyus, the southern Ryukyus and Taiwan, were also examined for comparisons (Fig. 1, Table 1).",

In these tests, we adopted a null hypothesis that each sample is composed of individuals from a single randomly mating population.

Based on the differential patterns of alleles possessed at these loci, individuals in each of the four samples were grouped into two subsamples without any conflict: no individuals possessed a combination of alleles characteristic to both subsamples simultaneously, and genotype frequencies in each subsample satisfied Hardy\u2013Weinberg expectations at all polymorphic loci.

Furthermore, these entities showed fixed differences at six to eight loci on each island (Table 3), indicating the absence of gene flow between them. Detailed sampling data showed that several specimens of both entities were collected together from the same microhabitats on Tonakijima and Kumejima (e.g. from the same sidewall and the same small cottage along a forest road, and the same rocky cliff). This indicates that the two entities occur syntopically, at least in part, on these islands and thus potentially have chances to interbreed under natural conditions.

However, such a tendency was not evident in Tonakijima, where the two species were observed in nearly equal frequencies in both forest and open habitats. Tonakijima is much smaller (3.5 km2) than Iheyajima (20.6 km2) and Kumejima (58.4 km2), and thus may not be large enough for the two geckos to segregate their habitats.",

These results suggest that populations of \u2018Gekko hokouensis\u2019 in other regions of the East Asian islands are conspecific with the Okinawan Group 1 populations, and that the species represented by the Group 2 populations is geographically restricted to the Okinawa Group. Gekko hokouensis was originally described from Hok\u2019ou (= Yanshan), Jiangxi Province, eastern continental China (Pope 1928; Zhao & Adler 1993) (Fig. 1). We have no direct information at present regarding the relationships among the present two cryptic species in the East Asian islands and the typical G. hokouensis due to the lack of available continental samples. As far as the currently available information is concerned, however, it is most likely that the species having a much broader range over the East Asian islands including Taiwan on the continental shelf (i.e. that represented by the Group 1 populations) also occurs in eastern continental China. Therefore, we tentatively regard the species represented by Group 1 as the nominotypical species and the other as a possible undescribed species endemic to the Okinawa Group. More extensive allozyme surveys incorporating the continental samples, along with detailed morphological comparisons, are strongly desired to resolve the taxonomic problem raised by the above results.",

These values are much greater than those previously reported for many conspecific populations in various organisms (D < 0.16) (Thorpe 1982). This seems to negate the probability of their recent divergence from each other. On the other hand, the two species are seemingly identical externally, sharing a suite of character states diagnostic of G. hokouensis (see above). Similar examples of apparent morphological identity between genetically divergent species have been reported for other groups of reptiles (Good et al. 1996; Sadlier et al. 1999). Such a situation is attributable to the long parallel retention of primitive character states, or otherwise to independent acquisitions of derived states (i.e. convergence) (Mayr & Ashlock 1991). Further phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of these and other congeneric species, and the mapping of relevant character states on the resultant phylogenetic tree, will clarify which of these evolutionary phenomena is responsible for the remarkable external similarity of such genetically divergent entities.",
