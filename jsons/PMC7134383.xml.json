Shared value creation provides complementary benefits to the partners and complementary benefits are what is at the core of a sustainable partnership [5]. Small and large firms have complementary strengths and weaknesses in terms of research and development (R&D). The flexible structures and agile operations of SMEs are especially suitable for the early stages of the innovation process where ideas are created and conceptualised [5, 6]. SMEs have a relative advantage in learning and knowledge creation in emerging and risky areas [7]. Large firms on the other hand, have existing structures that are suitable for testing, documentation and operation processes that are found at the later stages of innovation [5]. The deep specialisation of SMEs can complement the service offering of large firms where they do not have the internal expertise. Large firms can in turn, expose SMEs to the critical resources and capabilities required to realise innovating ideas [2, 7].",

New and specialised capabilities are often considered a prerequisite to enable growth to new areas. While large firms usually focus on the products and services with major potential, they are able to access new capabilities from specialist firms, with less capital investment required on their own part [2, 5]. For SMEs, this means that they are able to move into the markets of the large firm without acquiring additional capabilities [8]. The advantage of partnerships with firms who have chosen to specialise in those activities, is that these firms are likely to perform the activities better. As a result, every activity is being performed by a tightly focused firm [2]. Their first-mover advantage will be enhanced, enabling them to increase their market share [8].",

SMEs would often receive customer-triggered relationship requirements, resulting in the need to customise technologies and systems specifically to suit their partners [5, 12]. While these adaptations imply considerable, often non-transferable, investments by one or both parties, it simultaneously provides learning opportunities. The knowledge that SMEs acquire throughout the unique projects can be transferred to other partnerships or developed to products. In this regard, partnerships are seen as a key resource access to valuable organisational, technical and market knowledge held by key customers. This knowledge can then be used to improve and upgrade products and services, production facilities and organisational units and mechanisms [11].",

The research in this paper therefore followed the constructivist philosophical perspective, and was conducted primarily through an exploratory approach. Jabareen\u2019s (2009) conceptual framework analysis (CFA) method formed the foundation upon which the RCF was developed, with specific procedures modified according to the nature and requirements for this study. The CFA method is commonly used to build conceptual frameworks from multiple bodies of knowledge that belong to different disciplines [18]. Due to the ability of the CFA method to clarify conceptual linkages between different domains it was deemed an appropriated method to guide the development of the RCF. The six phases of the CFA method is summarised in Table 1.\n",

This was done by labelling each of the concepts with a relevant theme that describes the attributes, characteristics of and assumptions around each. After each of the concepts has been deconstructed, Jabareen (2009) explains that the concepts should be categorised accordingly.

At the same time, the granularity of the model allows that capability issues to be addressed incrementally and in part. The nature of the model is thus suitable for SMEs, for whom large, expensive and time-consuming projects are often not a feasible option. Future research to evaluate the maturity of the capability requirements in a wide range of firms is proposed. This would highlight the capability requirements as a firm develops. The aim is to enable owner-managers to improve their relational capability requirements proactively, and ultimately improve their ability to establish and sustain beneficial partnerships.",
