Death in many cases is a result of irreversible lung injury related to both host inflammatory responses and direct cellular effects of viral infection (cytopathology and apoptosis). Hence, modulation of the host proinflammatory response might be a tractable complementary therapeutic strategy and offers an advantage compared with antivirals in avoiding emergence of drug-resistant variants. Furthermore, some host-cell pathways are essential for viral replication, so that some host-directed inhibitors have the potential to diminish both viral replication and harmful inflammatory responses.26\n",

Once neuraminidase inhibitors became available, preclinical studies showed additive or synergistic in-vitro activity and increased survival in murine models with combinations of an adamantane with a neuraminidase inhibitor.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 The first randomised controlled trial of combination therapy in hospital inpatients, done by the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group in the late 1990s, showed that a regimen of oral rimantadine and nebulised zanamivir seemed to exert a slightly greater antiviral effect and prevent emergence of adamantane resistance compared with one of rimantadine and nebulised saline.41 A subsequent randomised controlled trial in outpatients reported evidence for possible antagonism with a combination of oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir,42 an observation that emphasised the importance of detailed preclinical studies before embarking on clinical trials. Subsequent studies have led to several randomised controlled trials testing the safety and efficacy of various combinations of influenza antivirals (table 1\n).",

However, dose adjustments in the setting of renal insufficiency are still to be identified, and the recommended dose regimen varies with the target population (Asian and white). In Japan, where favipiravir has been approved for treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections (limited to cases in which other anti-influenza virus drugs are ineffective or not sufficiently effective),85 a phase 3 study in uncomplicated influenza showed similar antiviral effects as oseltamivir.86 A phase 2 treatment study completed in adults reported evidence for symptom alleviation,87 and a large phase 3 randomised controlled trial in uncomplicated disease was initiated during the 2013\u201314 season (NCT02008344).

These findings suggest that the combination of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy with neutralising antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globin would be an appropriate choice for study in patients with severe H7N9 illness once available.",

In mice infected with avian H5N1 virus, simvastatin given with oseltamivir did not improve the efficacy of oseltamivir monotherapy,131 whereas a preliminary study reported some disease-modifying effects with a triple regimen of osetltamivir, simvastatin, and fenofibrate compared with oseltamivir alone.132 Observational studies from the 2009 pandemic did not find improved outcomes in severely ill patients given neuraminidase inhibitors and various immunomodulatory therapies including macrolides and statins.133 One retrospective analysis in uncomplicated influenza did not find that the addition of clarithromycin to oseltamivir improved clinical outcomes.134 In a prospective observational study of critically ill patients with influenza without evidence of bacterial co-infection, treatment with macrolides was not associated with improved survival.135 However, several retrospective studies have reported substantial mortality benefits in patients taking statins who were subsequently admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza136 or pneumonia.137, 138 Other studies have not shown such results, and the possible benefit of starting statins at the time of influenza onset or treatment in hospital has not been reported. One randomised controlled trial in an intensive care unit suggested reduced risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality with addition of pravastatin therapy in patients needing mechanical ventilation;139 further studies are warranted.",

The administration of Chinese herbs might also have beneficial immunomodulatory effects, but few clinical trials have been reported about the effects of combination therapy in influenza. One multicentre, prospective non-blinded randomised controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir, maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, and the combination of both in treatment of outpatients with 2009 pandemic influenza A.151 Both individual agents accelerated fever resolution compared with placebo, and the combination showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in time to fever resolution compared with oseltamivir alone (median hours to alleviation of fever, 20\u00b70 [95% CI 17\u00b70 to 24\u00b70] vs 15\u00b70 [12\u00b70 to 18\u00b70]).

Since doing randomised controlled trials in seriously ill hospital inpatients is particularly difficult and resource intensive,120 initial proof-of-concept studies might be done in alternative populations such experimentally infected volunteers152 or outpatients with influenza. For antiviral combinations, the initial goal is to show tolerability and greater antiviral effects than with monotherapy.

The possibility of using immunomodulatory interventions will need to consider the particular target population and disease stage, the goal of either suppressing adverse host responses or supplementing deficient ones, and the timing of initiating and ceasing the intervention in relation to the course of illness. Adaptive clinical trial designs offer greater flexibility and efficiency through planned modifications, such as changes to sample size and treatment arms based on statistical analysis of data generated in the early stages of a trial.153 By incorporating objective endpoints, such designs would enable the study of several different combinations simultaneously.",
