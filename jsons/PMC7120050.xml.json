            "text": "Coronaviruses have large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes (1). During infection, four structural proteins are expressed: spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E). The viral envelope E protein is thought to alter membrane morphology at the virus assembly site, thus promoting virus budding (2\u2013(10). Additionally, more infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is produced in infected cells than is incorporated into virions, suggesting that IBV E may have a function apart from its role in virus budding (3). Consistent with this idea, studies have indicated that the E protein from several coronaviruses may act as a viroporin (1\n(1\u2013(1\n(4). However, no conclusive experiments in infected cells have confirmed this possibility. In addition to the coronavirus structural proteins, several other open reading frames (ORFs) located between the structural protein ORFs produce proteins of undetermined function during infection (1\n(5). These proteins are thought to be nonstructural, accessory proteins that are essential for productive virus infection in the natural host, but dispensable for virus growth in cell culture (1\n(6\u2013(2\n(3). Therefore, study of these accessory proteins, in addition to study of the coronavirus structural proteins, may more fully elucidate pathogenesis mechanisms and lead to the development of more effective antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "IBV, a group 3 coronavirus that infects chickens, produces two nonstructural proteins, 3a and 3b, from ORFs located between the S and E genes (2\n(4). Both of these proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNA 3, with IBV 3a translation initiated via the first AUG, and the downstream IBV 3b translation initiated via leaky ribosomal scanning (2\n(5). Subgenomic mRNA 3 also produces the IBV E protein through an internal ribosomal entry site. We have developed antibodies specific to each of these IBV gene 3 proteins for use in characterization and functional studies. IBV E was found to localize to Golgi membranes via its C-terminal tail (3,(2\n(6). IBV E also promoted the release of virus-like particles through the interaction of its C-terminal tail with the IBV M protein (2\n(7). Studies on the IBV 3a protein demonstrated that one pool of IBV 3a localized cytoplasmically, while another pool associated with membranes at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2\n(8). The short length of IBV 3a appeared to preclude efficient association with signal recognition particle (SRP), causing inefficient co-translational insertion of IBV 3a into membranes. Thus, IBV may limit 3a levels at smooth ER membranes by a novel mechanism.",

            "text": "Conversely, IBV 3b localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells when using a vaccinia virus expression system (1\n(8,(2\n(9). However, IBV 3b was undetectable via microscopy of IBV-infected or transiently transfected mammalian cells (2\n(9). Surprisingly, IBV 3b, which was readily detected in chicken cells, localized to the cytoplasm with apparent nuclear exclusion. The half-life of IBV 3b was greatly reduced in mammalian cells as compared to chicken cells. This rapid turnover in mammalian cells was proteasome-dependent, whereas turnover in avian cells was proteasome-independent. Thus, the importance of using cells derived from the natural host when studying coronavirus nonstructural proteins is highlighted. This chapter details methods for generating polyclonal antibodies to the IBV gene 3 proteins, including protocols for generating peptides or fusion proteins for immunizing rabbits, prescreening of nonimmunized rabbit sera, general rabbit immunization procedures, and screening sera from immunized rabbits.",

Peptides corresponding to transmembrane regions should not be used for immunizing rabbits since they may not allow the antibody access to the protein in some assays. One helpful website for creating hydropathy plots is found at http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protscale.html. Proteins should also be analyzed for the presence of domains that are highly conserved in many different proteins, such as coiled-coil, protein targeting, or DNA-binding motifs. Peptides corresponding to these types of motifs should not be used for immunizing rabbits as they may generate antibodies that recognize several different proteins. A list of helpful websites for predicting these types of motifs is found at http://ca.expasy.org/tools/. We have had success using peptides (around 14 amino acids in length) that correspond to the unique C- or N-terminal regions of the IBV gene 3 proteins. However, the antigenicity of these different peptides has varied, as shown in Fig.\n1A.\n\nPeptides are synthesized using an automated synthesizer and purified to \u226590% purity (see\nNote 8). If the peptide region does not contain a cysteine, then a cysteine must be added during the synthesis process so that it can be coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (see\nNote 9). A minimum of 1.75 mg of peptide is required for injection into rabbits in Section 3.4. We order commercially synthesized peptides from Boston Biomolecules, Inc. (Boston, MA), precoupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a cysteine added to one end of the peptide. However, coupling can also be done using commercially available kits from companies such as Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (see\nNote 10).\n",

Bacteria are then heated at 42\u00b0C for 1 min, placed on ice for 2 min, and plated on YT-amp plates overnight at 37\u00b0C.One individual bacterial colony carrying the pGEX-2T plasmid is picked and grown overnight in 2 ml of YT-amp broth. Twelve individual bacterial colonies carrying the plasmid encoding the GST fusion protein are picked and grown overnight in 2 ml of YT-amp broth (see\nNote 11).The next day each individual culture is diluted 1:10 in 2 ml of YT-amp broth and grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.6.GST protein expression is induced by adding 2 \u03bcl of inducing solution to cultures and growing them for 48 h at 13.5\u00b0C in a shaking water bath (see\nNotes 12 and 13).Bacteria are pelleted by centrifugation at 20,800 \u00d7 g for 1 min and resuspended in microcentrifuge tubes in 200 \u03bcl of PBSP.Bacteria are lysed by sonication (three 30-sec pulses on setting 4) using a Sonic Dismembrator Model 100 (Fisher) (see\nNote 14).Cellular debris is pelleted by centrifugation at 20,800 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C.

Noninfected or untransfected cells are also lysed. Approximately 100 \u03bcl of the LSB mixture is used per 35-mm dish. Once this mixture is added, a pipette tip is used to gently swirl the mixture across the cells. As the cells are lysed, the mixture becomes viscous owing to DNA and is then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube (samples can be stored at this point at \u201320\u00b0C for several weeks). Samples are then heated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C, until they are no longer viscous when the side of the tube is tapped.

Affinity purification can be done with either the peptides or the GST fusion proteins that were used to immunize rabbits in Section 3.4. The protocol for affinity purification of sera using peptides is given below. Changes that must be made to this protocol when using fusion proteins rather than peptides are given in the Notes.First, the cysteines in the purified peptides from Section 3.1 are reduced. To do this, we used the commercially available Reduce-Imm Immobilized Reductant Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nThe kit reductant column is washed with 10 ml of kit equilibration buffer #1 and activated by adding 10 ml of DTT solution.The column is then washed again in 20 ml of kit equilibration buffer #1 (see\nNote 23).1 ml of diluted peptide is then added to the column (see\nNote 24).The column is eluted with 9 ml of kit equilibration buffer #1, and 1-ml fractions are collected (see\nNote 25).\nFractions are tested for the presence of free sulfhydryls using Ellman\u2019s Reagent.\n50 \u03bcl of each fraction is transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing 950 \u03bcl of kit equilibration buffer #1.100 \u03bcl of Ellman\u2019s Reagent is then added to each tube.Tubes are incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and free sulfhydryl concentration is determined by absorbance measured at 412 nm.Fractions with similarly high absorbance measurements are pooled for use in subsequent steps.Additionally, the absorbance at 280 nm of the pooled fractions is measured, in order to calculate coupling efficiency during step 3.\nTo couple peptides to agarose beads, we used the commercially available SulfoLink kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFirst, the coupling column is brought to room temperature, and the storage buffer is allowed to drain from the column after removing both top and bottom caps.The column is then equilibrated with 12 ml of SulfoLink equilibration buffer.The pooled peptide fractions from step 3d are then added to the column and the top cap of the column is replaced.The column is then rotated for 15 min at room temperature.Column-peptide mixtures are then incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature without rotation.The buffer is allowed to drain and the columns are washed with 6 ml of coupling buffer.The absorbance at 280 nm of the column eluate is measured (see\nNote 26).Unbound column sites are then blocked by the addition of 2 ml of cysteine buffer.The column is then rotated for 15 min at room temperature, before being allowed to incubate without rotation for an additional 30 min at room temperature.All liquid is then drained from the column and the column is washed four times in 4 ml of wash buffer and three times in 4 ml of 0.05% NaN3.If needed, the column can now be stored at 4\u00b0C. Usually, an additional 4\u20136 ml of 0.05% degassed NaN3 is added to the column before storage to ensure that the column will not dry out during storage.\nProtein-specific antibodies in the rabbit sera are then bound to the column, washed, and eluted.\nThe storage liquid is removed from the column, and 2.5 ml of serum is added to the column and rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C.The column is allowed to drain and this flow-through is saved as it may contain antibodies that did not bind to the column (see\nNote 27).The column is then washed with 25 ml of ice-cold WB 1 and 25 ml of ice-cold WB 2. The column should be kept at 4\u00b0C during these washes.The column is eluted by adding 5 ml of elution solution. Three 1.5-ml fractions are collected and 5 \u03bcl of 30% BSA is immediately added.Fractions are transferred into dialysis bags and dialyzed three times for 24 h at 4\u00b0C in 1 liter of PBS (see\nNote 28).Fractions are separated into 100-\u03bcl aliquots and screened using procedures from Section 3.5. Aliquots should be stored at \u201380\u00b0C.\n\n",

A 10-ml plastic pipette is then rolled across these layers to remove any bubbles trapped between them before closing the transfer cassette.The transfer cassette is put into a transfer apparatus kept in a 4\u00b0C cold room, filled with enough cooled transfer buffer to cover the top of the PVDF membrane.

However, unless specifically stated otherwise, chemicals from other commercial sources are usually acceptable substitutes.dH2O: water having a resistivity of 18.2 M\u03a9-cmOther cell types can be used with this transient transfection protocol. However, the protocol listed here is optimized for Vero and DF1 cells. To use this protocol with other cell types, the total amount of DNA and the DNA:Fugene ratio will have to be optimized. Additionally, other transfection reagents may give higher transfection efficiencies with different cell types.Paraformaldehyde solutions will corrode pH electrodes; therefore, pH paper should always be used when testing the pH of paraformaldehyde solutions.Other types of mounting solutions that contain fluorescence stabilizing chemicals can generally be used with this protocol. However, if secondary antibodies are conjugated to cyanine dyes (such as Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5), then mounting solutions that contain aromatic amines (such as phenylenediamine) should not be used.As an alternative to using washed pansorbin, protein A-sepharose can be used to precipitate antigen-antibody complexes.The IBV 3a and IBV 3b proteins do not bind well to nitrocellulose membranes. The IBV E protein binds to both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes equally well.Peptide purities greater than 90% can be obtained from commercial companies for an increased price. However, in our experience, 90%-pure peptides are sufficient for obtaining rabbit sera specific to the protein of interest.If a peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of a protein is synthesized, then the extra cysteine should be added to the N-terminus of the peptide. On the other hand, if a peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of a protein is synthesized, then the extra cysteine should be added to the C-terminus of the peptide.In our experience, ordering IBV 3a, IBV 3b, and IBV E peptides for injecting rabbits has been much more cost- and time-effective than expressing and purifying fusion proteins from bacteria. Expressing and purifying the IBV 3a and IBV 3b fusion proteins in bacteria have been very difficult, requiring optimization of many steps in the protocol listed in Section 3.2. Moreover, high yields of soluble IBV 3a fusion protein have not yet been obtained, likely owing to toxicity to bacteria.In generating the GST-IBV 3b fusion protein, problems were consistently encountered during attempts to scale up protein expression and purification, so multiple small-scale productions were performed instead.Multiple 1000X inducing solution concentrations (1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, and 0.001 M IPTG) were tested for their ability to produce soluble GST-IBV 3b.Multiple inducing temperatures and times were tested for their ability to produce soluble GST-IBV 3b, including 37\u00b0C for 2 h, 30\u00b0C for 2 h, 25\u00b0C for 2 h, 16\u00b0C for 24 h, 16\u00b0C for 48 h, 13.5\u00b0C for 24 h, 13.5\u00b0C for 48 h, 10\u00b0C for 24 h, and 10\u00b0C for 48 h. The temperature and time that best induced soluble protein was 13.5\u00b0C for 48 h. Additionally, one-half of the volume of water in the shaking water bath was added immediately before tubes were added, so that the water temperature gradually decreased over several minutes to 13.5\u00b0C.Any frothing of samples during the sonication process increases the likelihood of denaturing GST fusion proteins so that they are unable to bind to glutathione sepharose beads in subsequent steps.Multiple elution times were tested for their ability to yield high GST-IBV 3b concentrations, including 2 h, 4 h, 10 h, 24 h, and 48 h.The same protocol is used for injecting rabbits with peptides, except that the micrograms of peptide used for each injection is doubled.Rats can also be immunized to generate sera for co-localization experiments with rabbit sera. This protocol is also used for immunizing rats, except that 200 \u03bcg of protein is required for the initial injection and 100 \u03bcg of protein is required for all subsequent injections.This injection schedule can be terminated early if rabbit sera show high enough titers following early injections.In our experience, screening sera by in vitro transcription and translation of protein is essential. We first obtained anti-IBV 3b sera from injecting rabbits with IBV 3b peptides. However, we screened these sera only by immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected and infected Vero cells. No specific IBV 3b staining was seen during this screening; therefore, we assumed that anti-IBV 3b antibodies were not generated. This result led us to inject rabbits with purified GST-IBV 3b fusion proteins. Screening of these new sera using in vitro transcribed and translated IBV 3b demonstrated that high titers of anti-IBV 3b antibodies had been generated (2\n(9). However, IBV 3b could still not be detected in Vero cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the extremely short half-life of IBV 3b in transiently transfected or infected Vero cells hampers its visualization in these cells. However, IBV 3b is readily detected in chicken cells since it is turned over differently in these cells. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the antibody production using IBV 3b peptides showed similar staining patterns in chicken cells as the antibodies generated from GST-IBV 3b fusion proteins. IBV 3b was eventually detected by immunoprecipitation from Vero cells by increasing the dish size and the amount of radioactive label. Representative results are shown in Fig.\n14.4.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods can be used for screening sera. However, antibodies may show different binding affinities depending on the methods used. Therefore, screening sera using methods that will be used in future experiments is generally more informative.The amount of primary antibody needed for immunoprecipitation reactions must be titered to ensure that antibodies are saturating. Therefore, immunoprecipitation procedures are repeated with the supernatant to confirm that antibodies are in excess to antigen. We generally use 2 or 3 \u03bcl of serum for each immunoprecipitation.Antibodies are often able to access their epitopes differently under different immunofluorescence microscopy fixation and permeabilization conditions. Therefore, alternate fixation and permeabilization conditions may have to be employed when screening antibodies: (i) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in PBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.18% TritonX-100 for 10 min at room temperature; (ii) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in methanol for 5 min at \u201320\u00b0C; (iii) fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in methanol of 5 min at \u201320\u00b0C; (iv) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in a 75% methanol, 25% acetic acid solution for 10 min at room temperature; (v) fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in PBS supplemented with 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. For alternate protocol (v) all subsequent washes and incubations with antibodies should be done in PBS/Gly supplemented with 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin.Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: wash the column with 10 ml of kit equilibration buffer #1, followed by an additional wash with 10 ml of kit equilibration buffer #2.Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: add 1 ml of the diluted protein to the column and incubate them together for 60 min at room temperature.The column is eluted with 9 ml of kit equilibration buffer #2. 2-ml fractions are collected.If the absorbance of the eluate is similar (given dilution factors) to the absorbance measured at the end of step 2, then the eluate should be reincubated with the coupling column and reeluted.Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: In order to remove antibodies that recognize GST, the entire procedure found in Section 3.6 can first be done using a column containing GST-coupled beads. The flow-through from this step is saved (it contains antibodies specific to the viral protein) and incubated with a different column that has the GST fusion protein coupled to it.After fractions are collected, the column can be stored for reuse. To store the column it must first be washed with 10 ml of 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in PBS. 2 ml of storage buffer is then added and the column is stored at 4\u00b0C. Before reuse, the column should be washed once in elution buffer.To obtain quality images by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, cells should be infected or transfected when they are approximately 50% confluent. However, to obtain higher levels of protein expression when immunoblotting or immunoprecipitating, cells can be infected or transfected when they are as high as 70\u201390% confluent.As a control for antibody specificity, sera from rabbits immunized with peptides can be preincubated with purified peptide before use in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. 20 \u03bcl of serum is mixed with 20 \u03bcl of a solution containing 10 mg of peptide per 10 \u03bcl of dH2O and rotated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. 160 \u03bcl of a solution containing 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS/Gly is then added to the antibody mixture and rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C. This antibody mixture is then diluted approximately 1:10 and used as the primary antibody in Section 3.11. Representative results of peptide-blocked versus unblocked antibody are shown in Fig.\n14.5.\n\nFor visualization on an inverted microscope, coverslips can be sealed onto the slides by brushing boat sealer or nail polish around the edges of the coverslip.For visualizing immunoprecipitated, unlabeled proteins, start the Section 3.12 protocol at step 2 and continue through step 9. Then perform the entire immuno- blotting protocol. Rabbit primary antibodies can be used if the protein of interest is less than 20 kDa in size (approximately the size of the rabbit IgG light chains). Alternatively, primary antibodies from a different species can be used for immunoblotting.Proteins with half-lives shorter than 30 min, such as IBV 3b when expressed in Vero cells (29), may not be easily visualized in certain cell types. Therefore, cells may have to be plated in larger dishes and incubated with increased amounts of radioactivity.For reproducible results, gels must be washed no longer than 10 min in dH2O. Longer wash times allow IBV 3a and IBV 3b to diffuse out of the gel. Fixation of gels with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid did not prevent diffusion of these proteins out of the gel in longer wash times.Clear visualization of the IBV 3a and IBV 3b proteins is best achieved on 17.5% low-bis polyacrylamide gels. However, the slightly larger IBV E protein is easily visualized on 12 or 15% low-bis polyacrylamide gels. The same ratio of polyacrylamide:bis-polyacrylamide used when making 17.5% low-bis gels should also be used when making 12 or 15% low-bis gels.If the gel becomes too hot while electrophoresing, then the lanes at the edge of the gel run slower than those in the middle, causing a \u201csmiling\u201d effect. To minimize this possibility, fans and/or cold packs can be used to help cool gels.\n",

Results from a 1:1000 dilution of sera harvested on day 52 (bleed 1) are shown. The C-terminal peptide of IBV E was much more immunogenic than the N-terminal peptide. Although rabbits immunized with the N-terminal IBV E peptide eventually produced antibodies specific to IBV E, the titers were always lower than those of rabbits immunized with the C-terminal IBV E peptide.
