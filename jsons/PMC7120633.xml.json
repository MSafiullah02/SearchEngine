Human infected H7N9 avian influenza virus is a newly emerging recombinant virus, which infects human via respiratory tract after contact to poultry with the infection. It has an incubation period of no more than 7 days. And the patients commonly experience flu like symptoms, such as fever, cough, expectoration of a little sputum as well as accompanying headache, muscle soreness and general malaise. In severe cases, the condition progresses rapidly into severe pneumonia, mostly with a body temperature of above 39 \u00b0C, dyspnea and possibly accompanying bloody sputum. Severe pneumonia may further progresses rapidly into ARDS, mediastinal emphysema, sepsis, shock, consciousness disturbance, and acute renal damage. By chest radiology, the disease is characterized by primary lesions in one lung that gradually involve both lungs along with progression of the condition. In addition, the multiple lesions in both lungs show a multi-segmental and multi-lobar distribution. For this case, the patient had a history of close contacts to feces of birds, and the disease is radiologically characterized by inflammation of lobes in one lung at its early stage. Along with the progression of the condition, both lungs are rapidly involved and ARDS finally occurred.

Human infection of H7N9 avian influenza virus directly induces pneumonia, with radiological signs of pneumonia early after onset.Early after onset, the lesions may be confined within one lung, the most commonly the right lung. If both lungs involved, the lesions distribute in multiple segments and multiple lung lobes that are predominantly and more serious in the right lung. In addition, the lesions in both lower lungs are more serious than in both upper lungs, which is possibly related to the posture for radiology and the anatomy of trachea. Radiologically, both the parenchymal and interstitial lesions are demonstrated as large consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, and sporadic ground glass opacity, with air bronchogram.During the progressive stage, human infected H7N9 avian influenza virus invades the lung tissues to induce the cytokine storm due to the absence of immunity to the new virus. Therefore, systematic inflammatory responses are triggered, with subsequent occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and multiple organs failure. Radiologically, the lesions in lungs rapidly develop to involve multiple segments and lobes. Due to diffuse alveolar damages, chest X-ray and CT scan demonstrate extensively distributed ground glass opacity and consolidation opacity in both lungs, with air bronchogram, predominantly in both lower lungs or the right upper lung. In some cases, subpleural line and/or interlobular septal thickening is demonstrated; and in some other cases, pleural effusion. Pneumothorax and mediastinal lymphadenectasis may also be demonstrated.During the convalescent stage, the lung lesions are demonstrated with slow absorption, shrinkage, and lightening in color after active anti-viral therapy and respiratory supportive therapy, with increased transparency of the lungs. The flakes of and nodular parenchymal lesions are rapidly absorbed, while the grid like and cords like interstitial lesions are absorbed slowly. Pleural thickening may persist for a long period of time. Due to the chronic stimulation by tracheal incubation, the symptoms of tracheal stenosis may occur.\n",

Chest X-ray showed large consolidation in the left lower lung and sporadic patches of opacity in the right lung. One day after treatment, these symptoms aggravated. Blood gas analysis showed type I respiratory failure. After that, the patient was transferred into ICU. By physical examination on admission, his body temperature 36.1 \u00b0C, heart rate 116/min, breathing rate 36/min, and blood pressure 116/67 mmHg. He respirated with the assistance of ventilators and showed no response to calling. Conjunctiva slightly swollen in both eyes, with no congestion, no yellowish sclera, equal size of bilateral pupils in a diameter of about 2 mm that are sensitive to light. Pharynx congested, bilateral tonsils no swelling, no special abnormality in heart examination. Fremitus weakened at the left chest, no sensation of pleural friction; dullness of the left lower lung by percussion; coarse breathing sounds of both lungs that was relatively weaker in the left lung; fine moist rales in both lungs. He reported a history of buying chicken in a market and cooking it on Nov. 20, 2013. Routine blood test showed WBC 3.48 \u00d7 109/L, GR% 76.1 %. Blood biochemistry revealed CK 3319U/L, LDH 882U/L, CKMB 32.5U/L, K+ 2.83 mmol/L, Na+ 133 nmol/L, troponin and BNP within normal limits, CRP 26.71 mg/L, ALT 136U/L, AST 470U/L, ALB 27 g/L. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.48, PO2 47 mmHg, PCO2 25.4 mmHg, and BE -5 mmol/L. CD4 T cell count was 42/\u03bcl. By etiological examination, his tracheal aspirates showed H7N9 nucleic acid positive.",

Pleural effusion in a small quantity was detected in the right pleural cavity; large consolidation in the left lower lung with air bronchogram inside; gas opacity in the anterior mediastinum and the left anterior thoracic wall (g). On d 39, chest CT scan demonstrated interlobular septal thickening in the dorsal segment of the left lower lung lobe, with local pleural thickening (h). Flakes of ground glass opacity was observed in the dorsal segment of left lower lung lobe, predominantly in the left lower lung lobe (i)",
