            "text": "Increasingly, RNA viruses appear to be responsible causal agents of newly emerging infections (Duffy et al., 2008, Holmes, 2004, Lai, 2003, Osterhaus, 2008). Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is one such emergent infection. Unlike other newly emerged zoonotic infections, SARS-CoV gained the ability to spread efficiently from human to human resulting in a worldwide outbreak (Osterhaus 2008). SARS-CoV causes severe respiratory disease in humans resulting in respiratory distress that requires ventilation support in approximately 20% of infected individuals (Knudsen et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2004). The global outbreak of SARS-CoV resulted in over 8000 infections worldwide in 2002\u20132003 (Baker, 2004, Knudsen et al., 2003, Ksizek et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003). Although, such an outbreak has not recurred, the presence of SARS-CoV in environmental reservoirs remains a threat to human health (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Normile, 2005). Therefore, it is important to establish therapeutic interventions against this potentially life threatening infection.",

A number of therapeutic strategies such as inhibition of viral entry, viral replication, and viral maturation have been investigated (Golda and Pyrc, 2008, Osterhaus, 2008). Amongst these, inhibition of viral entry is particularly attractive since it will protect target cells from infection thereby reducing the viral load, and allowing the host immune system sufficient time to mount an effective immune response and clear the virus.",

However, it has a distinct S1 domain that mediates receptor binding. The 318\u2013510 amino acid region within S1 represents the receptor binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004). The S2 domain mediates fusion between the viral and host membranes (Ksiazek et al., 2003) that is required for releasing the viral genome into the cell (Ingallinella et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Tripet et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004). Since both binding and fusion events are mediated through the S protein, mAbs that recognize the S protein may inhibit either of these steps.",

            "text": "Previously, we generated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies using B cells from XenoMouse\u00ae immunized with SARS-CoV S protein (Coughlin et al., 2007). We identified several epitopes recognized by S1 specific mAbs and found that a majority of these neutralizing antibodies can react with the RBD. The RBD specific antibodies were designated as group 1 based on epitope mapping and further subgrouped based on the antibody complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences (Coughlin et al., 2007). We demonstrate that the group 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) neutralize SARS-CoV by preventing association of S protein with the receptor on the surface of the target cells. Regions upstream of the RBD in S1 as well as epitopes within the S2 domain (Coughlin et al., 2007, Duan et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2006, Keng et al., 2005) can also elicit neutralizing antibodies. In this context, we identified one mAb that binds upstream of the SARS-CoV RBD, between amino acids 12 and 261 (Coughlin et al., 2007). We demonstrate that this mAb neutralizes the virus by preventing a post-binding step in viral entry. Furthermore, we show that combinations of antibodies are more effective than individual antibodies in neutralizing the wild type as well as mutant viruses selected in the presence of individual mAbs. These data suggest that targeting more than one epitope and/or step in the viral entry will likely confer better protection against SARS-CoV.",

In order to understand the underlying mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies, we developed a receptor binding inhibition assay using VeroE6 cells that naturally express the ACE2 receptor on their surface (Li et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004). The recombinant S protein fragment represented by amino acids 12\u2013510 carrying a human Fc tag (S12\u2013510-Fc) was bound to the surface of target cells at an optimal concentration. The maximal binding of the recombinant protein was detected upon staining with a FITC conjugated anti-human IgG antibody using flow cytometry. The S12\u2013510-Fc recombinant protein was pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of each of the 19 previously identified and characterized S1 specific mAbs (Coughlin et al., 2007) and binding of the protein in the presence of the mAbs was determined and compared to the maximal binding. The IC50 value for each mAb was determined by the inhibition curve generated with increasing concentrations of mAb (Table 1\n). Cells alone, cells lacking the cellular receptor (PA-1), cells mixed with non-ACE2 binding S12\u2013327-Fc fragment, as well as isotype control antibody were included as negative controls to determine non-specific binding and non-specific inhibition. No non-specific binding or non-specific inhibition occurred (Fig. 1A). Representative data obtained for group 1 neutralizing mAbs are shown in Fig. 1A.",

The post-binding events were detected by binding the pseudovirus to the surface of the target 293T/T17 cells transiently transfected with ACE2 at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, which allowed viral attachment but not entry. Following binding of the pseudovirus, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the 4D4 mAb and further incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The mAb 4D4 could efficiently prevent viral entry into target cells when added post-pseudovirus binding (Fig. 2\n).

Therefore, we tested the ability of eleven anti-S1 mAbs to yield escape mutants. Cultivation of virus in the presence of nine of the eleven mAbs resulted in the emergence of escape mutants at different passages. Passage of virus in the presence of 2EC50 of three of the mAbs 3C7, 3H12, and 4D4 resulted in the emergence of escape virus within the first several passages (Table 2\n) perhaps because mutants that could escape neutralization existed within the viral population or mutation occurred early in the virus replication. The existence of escape mutants was confirmed by growing the virus in the presence of higher doses of the corresponding mAb, up to 8EC50 (Table 2). Other mAbs (5D6, 4A10, 5A5, 5E4, 6B1, and 1B5) resulted in the generation of escape mutants over several passages. Of these mAbs, all except for mAb 4A10 resulted in escape virus observed only in the sub-neutralizing concentration of 1EC50 (Table 2). Viruses grown in the presence of either 6C1 or 6C2 did not yield escape mutants at any of the concentrations throughout the nine passages, suggesting the possible recognition of conserved/essential regions within the S1 domain by these antibodies (Table 2).",

This observation is consistent with that made by other investigators (Rockx et al., 2008, Sui et al., 2004). The mAb, 4D4 that binds upstream of the RBD, between amino acids 12 and 261 had no significant effect on viral attachment to the target cells but inhibited a post-binding event and prevented viral entry. Recently, a neutralizing antibody, nAb 256, generated from a non-immune scFv library was also found not to inhibit RBD binding (Sui et al., 2008). However, unlike 4D4 this antibody recognizes an epitope within the RBD. The nAb 256 was demonstrated to have a broader ability to bind to S protein variants, albeit with weak neutralizing ability (Sui et al., 2008). The mechanism of inhibition by nAb 256 is not yet known, and the lower efficiency was likely a consequence of selecting the antibody from a library generated using non-immune cells. Therefore, nAb 256 may not have undergone affinity maturation that results from immunization. The mAb 4D4 described here is the first example of an antibody that binds within the N-terminus of the S protein and neutralizes SARS-CoV by inhibiting a post-binding event necessary for viral entry.",

            "text": "Although the function of the N-terminal region of the S1 domain is not clearly defined, a role for this region in mediating dimerization of S protein has been suggested (Tian et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2004). Additionally, deletion of the first 103 amino acids of the S protein leads to a loss of ability to mediate fusion while retaining ACE2 binding (Tian et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). The ability of mAb 4D4 to more efficiently inhibit viral entry when added post virus binding suggests that the S protein might undergo a conformational change following binding to ACE2 leading to unmasking of the epitope recognized by the 4D4 antibody. These results support the notion that the N-terminus of the S protein contributes to the conformational change required to mediate fusion between the viral and host membranes. The S protein cleavage within the endosome by cathepsin L is essential to initiate fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes (Bosch et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). Cathepsin L can cleave at amino acid 678 located within the junction of the S1 and S2 domains (Bosch et al., 2008) of the S protein. Other studies have suggested that a conformational change is necessary for the S protein cleavage by cathepsin L (Simmons et al., 2005). Although definitive proof is yet to be generated, it is possible that mAb 4D4 could prevent the conformational change necessary for the S protein cleavage by cathepsin. This speculation is supported by earlier demonstration of the inhibition of the pH-dependent fusion process within the endosome for both Influenza virus and West Nile virus by viral neutralizing antibodies that do not block viral attachment (Imai et al., 1998, Thompson et al., 2009). West Nile virus opsonized by a fusion inhibitory antibody resulted in the retention of the virus in the endosome and likely led to targeted destruction of the virus particle in the lysosomal compartment of the cell (Thompson et al., 2009). These studies suggest that mAbs which can specifically inhibit cathepsin cleavage of specific viral glycoproteins may serve as novel therapies against viruses including Ebola virus, reovirus, and human CoV-229E.",

Use of mAb 4D4 with another mAb (such as 3C7 or 5D3) resulted in increased inhibition. It is important to note that the combination of mAbs 4D4 and 3C7 conferred near complete protection at an antibody concentration of 0.781 \u03bcg/ml, while individual antibodies required about 12.5 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 4). This however is not true for all mAb combinations such as mAbs 4D4 and 1B5. The mAb 1B5 was previously determined to bind upstream of the RBD, however, subsequent analysis determined that the purified mAb 1B5 can in fact bind to the RBD. Lack of synergistic effect indicated that the mAbs 4D4 and 1B5 likely interact with closely positioned conformational epitopes and compete with each other for binding. Similarly, a combination of RBD specific mAbs conferred protection in senescent mice against SARS-CoV challenge; however, the combination was no more efficient than when antibodies were administered individually indicating that the antibodies were possibly competing for binding to the same region (Rockx et al., 2008). These observations highlight the importance of carefully selecting different mAbs to form a therapeutic cocktail.",

Although several mAbs did not readily give rise to escape mutants, the escape variants did appear in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of mAbs. This suggested that escape mutants were most likely generated in response to mAb pressure. The escape mutants generated in this study have not yet been sequenced; however, nucleic acid sequence of escape mutants from other studies has revealed that a single point mutation can confer resistance against the selecting antibody (Mitsuki et al., 2008, Sui et al., 2008, ter Meulen et al., 2006 It would be interesting to determine the three dimensional structures of S proteins from mutant viruses and the antibodies used for their selection and relate how the mutation induced change in the conformation of the protein affected its binding to the selecting antibody.",

However, the propensity of these antibodies to allow escape mutants to arise when used alone precludes their individual therapeutic utility. An ideal passive therapy should eliminate or minimize the appearance of escape variants. In this context it is important to note that in the presence of mAbs 6C1 and 6C2 escape mutants failed to arise suggesting that changes in these epitopes might be detrimental to SARS-CoV.
