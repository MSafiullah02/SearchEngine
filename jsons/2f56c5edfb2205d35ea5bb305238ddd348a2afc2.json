            "text": "with interest the article by Joob et al.1 hypothesizing that COVID-19 infection might present with a skin rash and petechiae. During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, clinical studies did obviously not focus on the skin manifestations of COVID-19. However, it is likely they exist, and are probably underrecognized because of the current lack of dermatology consultations in these patients. Recently, Recalcati et al.2 reported the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 infection in Italy, and described 3 main patterns: erythematous rash, urticaria, and chickenpox-like lesions. However, none of these two published articles included clinical images due to safety concerns with transmission of the virus or to a low suspicion of association with it.These weeks we are living the same dramatic situation in Spain, especially in Madrid, and we are beginning to observe some skin manifestations in patients with COVID-19 infection.Herein we present an 84-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia, who was admitted owing to a bilateral pneumonia by COVID-19 infection, starting treatment with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir upon admission. After 3 days of hospitalization (11 days since the onset of COVID symptoms), the patient developed erythemato-purpuric, millimetric, coalescing macules, located in flexural regions. The rash was mildly pruriginous and mainly located in the peri-axillary area (Figures 1A and 1B).Whether skin lesions in patients with COVID-19 infection are related with the virus is still unclear. Viral rashes and drug reactions are clinically and histologically similar, and often hard to distinguish. However, thousands of patients worldwide have received both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, and there are scarce or no reports of skin drug reactions in these patients. In addition, it is not unlikely that COVID-19 may have cutaneous manifestations, as it occurs with other common viral infections. A thorough history of the patient must be obtained in order to assess the etiology, especially possible eliciting drugs, and time relationship to both drug intake and onset of the COVID-19 symptoms.",
