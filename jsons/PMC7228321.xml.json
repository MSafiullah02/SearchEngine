In China, he had had no contact with live food markets, people known to have COVID\u201019, or hospitals. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, and he had ceased smoking four years previously. He developed fever on 20 January and a cough with sputum production on 23 January; on 24 January, he was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, from its emergency department with progressive dyspnoea. His temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, his heart rate 95 beats/min, and O2 saturation 94% on room air. A chest x\u2010ray showed subtle ill\u2010defined opacities in the middle zones bilaterally and in the left lower zone. A thoracic computed tomography scan on admission day four identified extensive ground glass opacities with a peribronchovascular and peripheral distribution in the middle to upper zones of the lungs (Box 1). Full blood examination results included a lymphocyte count of 0.80 \u00d7 109/L (reference range, 1.0\u20134.0 \u00d7 109/L). C\u2010reactive protein concentration peaked on admission day 6 at 182 mg/L (reference range, 0\u20135 mg/L). Liver function test abnormalities peaked on admission day 12 \u2014 alkaline phosphatase, 210 U/L (reference range, 30\u2013110 U/L); \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase, 416 U/L (reference range, 30\u2013110 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 183 U/L (reference range, 5\u201340 U/L) \u2014 and hepatic steatosis was evident on liver ultrasound. Intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and azithromycin (500 mg/day) were commenced on admission day 4 to treat potential secondary bacterial pneumonia, although no bacterial pathogen was identified. Low\u2010flow oxygen (maximum 3 L/min via nasal prongs) was administered until admission day 10. The patient gradually improved; fever, productive cough and dyspnoea resolved by admission day 12, and he was discharged from hospital on 7 February (admission day 15).",

We continue to share live virus with other agencies, both locally and overseas, involved in the development and testing of therapeutic agents and vaccines.
