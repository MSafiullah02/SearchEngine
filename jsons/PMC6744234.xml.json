Structural analyses, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and X-ray crystallography, revealed pre- and postfusion structures, and biochemical analysis led to the proposal of a unified model for conformational changes of viral fusion proteins; receptor binding primes the formation of a membrane-embedded homotrimeric prehairpin structure that bridges viral and cellular membranes and then folds back on itself to form a hairpin structure, drawing the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity, resulting in lipid mixing (1\u20133). The postfusion form consists of a central N-terminal trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled coil (trimer of heptad repeat 1 [HR1]) surrounded by three C-terminal helices (HR2), generating a six-helix bundle (6HB) (1\u20133).",

However, the dynamic rearrangements underpinning the transition from pre- to postfusion structures remain largely uncharacterized. During membrane fusion in influenza virus and herpes simplex virus, a V- or Y-shaped density was observed in the intermediate state by cryoEM (14, 15), and in the retroviral Env trimer, an asymmetric intermediate appeared to emanate from a single protomer in cryo-electron tomography experiments (16). For the Moloney murine leukemia virus Env protein, the sequential release of the surface subunit from the transmembrane subunit induces the formation of an asymmetric trimer (17). Adoption of an asymmetric conformation presumably overcomes steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits.",

The N-terminal S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, and the C-terminal membrane-anchored S2 subunit is important for virus-cell membrane fusion. Some coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2), possess uncleaved 180-kDa S proteins. These viruses utilize cell surface or endosomal proteases (such as TMPRSS2, HAT, trypsin, elastase, or cathepsin L) to cleave S proteins during cell entry (2, 18\u201331). It remains controversial whether MERS-CoV S protein is processed by the cellular protease furin after internalization via endocytosis (32) because this finding was not supported by a recent study (33).",

            "text": "Our previous study showed that the S protein of MHV-2 requires a two-step conformational change process (26). The first step takes place after binding to a soluble form of the MHV receptor (CEACAM1a), upon which the metastable form of S protein is converted to a stable trimer possessing liposome-binding activity. The subsequent step is driven by protease digestion. From a single 180-kDa S protein, trypsin produces a 90-kDa subunit in the absence of receptor, but a 66-kDa subunit in the presence of receptor, and this 66-kDa species is thought to involve the formation of a 6HB structure (detected as a proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa subunit) (26). A similar result of the protease digestion pattern was also reported in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins (4, 20). Therefore, the sizes of protease digestion products are thought to be directly affected by the conformational state of the coronavirus S protein. Studying the MHV-2 S protein could illuminate the conformational changes occurring in each step and may provide novel insight into viral class I fusion proteins.",

To probe conformational changes of the MHV-2 S protein, an authentic virus rather than recombinant S protein was employed. Virus at 106 PFU in 10 \u03bcl of culture medium was treated with the soluble form of the MHV receptor (1 \u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin was added, followed by incubation for 30 min.

            "text": "As reported previously, the MHV-2f variant of MHV-2 harbors an amino acid substitution at the S1/S2 cleavage site that is cleaved by furin during biogenesis; this variant is sufficient to induce cell-cell fusion without supplemental trypsin in the culture medium (29). To clarify whether cleavage at the S1/S2 site is sufficient for S protein priming prior to induction of conformational changes, we compared trypsin-treated MHV-2 and MHV-2f with MHV-2. To generate trypsin-treated MHV-2, the MHV-2 was exposed to 1 \u03bcg/ml trypsin (or phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] for the uncleaved virus control) for 1 h, followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitors (both soybean trypsin inhibitor [STI] and camostat). Next, the viruses were purified using a Sephadex G-75 column. Figure 2A shows that, as reported previously (29), half of the S protein of MHV-2f was cleaved (lane 9), whereas almost all of the S protein expressed by the trypsin-treated virus was cleaved (lane 5) (compare to PBS-treated MHV-2 S protein [lane 1]). The trypsin-treated virus was able to enter cells as efficiently as the PBS-treated virus (Fig. 2B). The viruses were then exposed to both receptor and trypsin to induce conformational changes. A higher concentration of trypsin (50 \u03bcg/ml) was needed to cleave the S protein, presumably due to residual trypsin inhibitors. Although background levels of the 67- and 69-kDa products were observed in the absence of receptor (lane 6) (presumably due to the use of preincubated viruses), clear production of a 67-kDa fragment was observed in the presence of receptor and trypsin (lane 8). Interestingly, induction of the proteinase K-resistant 53-kDa band from the trypsin-treated virus was observed in the presence of receptor, even in the absence of trypsin (lane 7); in contrast, the other two viruses (PBS-treated MHV-2 and MHV-2f) required both receptor and trypsin. This implies that the two types of cleaved S protein have different conformations: the precleaved S protein (cleaved by furin during biogenesis) needs additional cleavage after the receptor-binding step, whereas the trypsin-treated S protein (cleaved on virus particle) needs only receptor binding to trigger the conformational changes. Cleavage at the S2\u2032 site (to generate the 69-kDa species) may trigger conformational changes, as reported previously (20, 30); however, cleavage at either the S1/S2 site or the S2\u2032 site is presumably enough to activate the MHV-2 S protein. The 67- and 69-kDa species can be considered by-products of the S protein following conformational changes; therefore, these products were examined to probe the intermediate conformation(s) of the S protein.",

To identify the trypsin cleavage site that produces the 67-kDa fragment, we attempted to gain indirect evidence because the 67-kDa subunit has not been successfully purified from the virus particle for amino-terminal sequencing. Both the 67- and 69-kDa subunits were detected by MAb-10G and anti-CT, but not by anti-S2a, even following increased exposure of blots, and only the 69-kDa subunit was detected by anti-VHCR (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the 69-kDa subunit is a product of cleavage between S2a and VHCR epitopes at the S2\u2032 site, as previously reported (11, 30), whereas the 67-kDa subunit is the result of cleavage at the C-terminal side of the VHCR epitope. Using the endoproteinases arg-C and lys-C to identify the specific arginine or lysine residue of the cleavage site, the 67-kDa subunit was found to be cleaved at a lysine residue (Fig. 3A).",

The 90-, 69-, and 67-kDa bands were shifted to 65, 47, and 43 kDa, respectively, after treatment with 0.32 or 32 \u03bcg/ml trypsin (Fig. 3B). The 4-kDa size difference between 43- and 47-kDa deglycosylated bands indicates that the 67-kDa subunit is cleaved at K951, because the calculated molecular weight of the peptide fragment between S2\u2032 (R907) and K951 is 4.8 kDa, whereas cleavage at the neighboring lysine K917 would yield a 1.3-kDa size difference and cleavage at K1008 would afford a 10.6-kDa size difference. The K951 cleavage site was therefore designated postS2\u2032. Notably, the postS2\u2032 cleavage site is in the 48th \u03b2-strand (\u03b248), which forms an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet with \u03b247 in the prefusion form but not in the postfusion form of the S protein (10, 11). Cleavage at postS2\u2032 is unlikely to contribute to S protein triggering because it is located at the C-terminal side of the fusion peptide (FP; Fig. 4A and B), and the appearance of the 67-kDa species does not correspond to the formation of the postfusion structure (53 kDa) or virus entry (Fig. 1C and D), as described above.",

We hypothesized that the S protein forms a heterogeneous trimer in the presence of receptor, so that each S protein in a trimer exposes a different cleavage site. In the first native SDS-PAGE step (gels were boiled before blotting so that the trimer could be detected by the antibody, as described in Materials and Methods), several different sizes of trimer were detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). In the second denaturing SDS-PAGE step, these trimer bands were separated into monomer bands (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). To examine the components of the trimer, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis. After treatment with 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin, both the 67- and 69-kDa bands, or the single 67-kDa band, were separated from three species of trimer at around 140 kDa (Fig. 5B and Cb), whereas only the 69-kDa band was detected following treatment with 0.32 \u03bcg/ml trypsin (Fig. 5Ca). These results suggest that a subset of S2 subunits can form a heterogeneous trimer comprising the 69- and 67-kDa species at a ratio of 3:0, 2:1, 1:2, or 0:3.",

MHV-2 was treated with receptor and trypsin to induce conformational changes, as described above. S protein detection was performed using four anti-S2 antibodies recognizing linear epitopes. Following soaking in stripping buffer to denature the S protein on the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, detection was then repeated with the same antibodies. When antibodies against the VHCR and CT epitopes were used, all bands detected in denatured blots (Fig. 6B) were the same as those observed in native blots (Fig. 6A), indicating that these epitopes are exposed on the S protein in both the native and denatured states. In the postfusion form of the S protein treated with receptor and trypsin, doublet bands at 140 kDa were observed using anti-CT antibody (Fig. 6A, CT, lane 4), while lower bands were not observed with the anti-VHCR antibody (Fig. 6A, VHCR, lane 4). This observation correlates with the appearance of 67- and 69-kDa bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, CT and VHCR, lane 4), suggesting that the upper band of 140-kDa species is composed of 67- and 69-kDa subunits, whereas the lower band comprises three 67-kDa subunits. This is consistent with the results in Fig. 5Cb showing that the 67- and 69-kDa bands were separated from 140-kDa trimer bands.",

We do not currently have an explanation for exposure of the S2a epitope, but this hydrophobic epitope is buried in the globule in the pre-fusion state (10) and is presumably exposed only in the native trimer after the receptor-binding step, before disappearing following cleavage by trypsin. When antibody recognizing the 10G epitope was used, monomeric S2 subunit species were detected in the native blot (Fig. 6A, 10G, lanes 3 and 4), but trimeric species were not observed, although they were detectable in the denatured blot (Fig. 6B, 10G, lanes 3 and 4).

The 53-kDa band was induced after a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C (lane 3), and the 67-kDa band appeared and became prominent over 4 min (lane 5), indicating that the conformational changes that induce the 6HB structure are complete at 1 min after treatment with trypsin. In preliminary electron microscopy (EM) experiments (described below), conformational changes of the S protein were probed in the presence of liposomes. The appearance of S2 fragments (90, 69, and 67 kDa) and the timing of cleavage coinciding with their appearance were the same in the absence and presence of liposomes (Fig. 7B and C).",

MHV-2 pretreated with soluble receptor was treated with HR2-mimicking peptide (50 \u03bcM) and various concentrations of trypsin. The 69-kDa but not the 67-kDa subunit disappeared following treatment with HR2-mimicking peptide, and the 55-kDa degradation product appeared after incubation in the presence of 8 \u03bcg/ml trypsin (Fig. 8A, lane 13). Presumably, protease-cleavable sites in the S2 subunit are vulnerable to scission by trypsin when the HR2-mimicking peptide is present due to the restriction of helical bundle formation by the HR motif; hence, the cleavage pattern was altered.

The trimer in the receptor-binding step is presumably constructed from both packed and unpacked HR1/HR2 motifs, and HR2-mimicking peptide interacts with an unpacked motif, and thereby interferes with 6HB formation. In the presence of 0.5 to 2 \u03bcg/ml trypsin, HR2-mimicking peptide did not appear to affect degradation of the 69-kDa fragment due to the low concentration of trypsin (Fig. 8A, lanes 5 to 10).

HR2-mimicking peptide was added to the S protein conformational change reaction at the indicated time points after stopping the reaction using dry ice-methanol, and mixtures were reincubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min to facilitate production of the 67- and 69-kDa fragments (reincubation is required to visualize bands that reflect the structure present upon HR2-mimicking peptide addition). At each HR2-mimicking peptide addition time point, if the HR1/HR2 motif forms an unpacked structure, the HR2-mimicking peptide would be expected to bind to HR1 and trypsin would degrade the 69-kDa to produce the 55-kDa lacking the CT epitope as described above (Fig. 8A and B). As shown in Fig. 8G (lane 2), the 67-kDa subunit appeared, the 69-kDa subunit disappeared, and the 55-kDa degradation product appeared following treatment with HR2-mimicking peptide after the receptor-binding step, suggesting that both packed and unpacked HR1/HR2 motifs simultaneously occur in the reaction. After a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C, undegraded 69-kDa subunit, which does not interact with HR2-mimicking peptide, was observed (Fig. 8G, lane 3), suggesting that both the 67- and 69-kDa fragments form a packed structure at this time point.",

These results correspond to liposome flotation assays in a previous study in which virus binding to liposomes was induced by receptor (26). Virus particles disappeared at 1 min after trypsin treatment (Fig. 10Div), and fused liposomes were the dominant species observed at 30 min (Fig. 10Dv), suggesting that membrane fusion with liposomes was largely complete within 1 min, and liposomes then fused with each other using the remaining S protein.

In contrast, most MHV variants carry S proteins that are cleaved by cellular furin at the S1/S2 site during biogenesis, which was believed to require only receptor binding to induce membrane fusion (37, 38). However, previous studies of MHV and MERS-CoV suggest that the coronaviruses harboring precleaved S protein (cleaved by furin during biogenesis) at the S1/S2 site require further cellular proteases to facilitate cell entry (20, 30). Our results also suggest that the S protein cleaved during biogenesis by furin requires additional cleavage to induce conformational changes required to adopt a proteinase K-resistant conformation (Fig. 2A, lane 12). However, the trypsin-treated S protein cleaved on virus particles at the S1/S2 site does not require additional cleavage; it needs only receptor binding (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Therefore, these two types of S protein cleaved at the S1/S2 site are predicted to have different conformations. In the present study, using MHV-2, the 67- and 69-kDa products were considered to be by-products that reflect intermediate conformations of the S protein, although the importance of cleavage at the S2\u2032 site was reported for coronavirus S proteins (20, 30).",

However, no major differences in the HR region were observed. Although structural analysis using cryoEM is excellent for detecting stable protein structures, unstable structures such as the HR2 motifs in the S2 subunit cannot be analyzed using this technique, even if a large number of protein particles are captured; population-based biochemical analysis is needed to capture features of unstable proteins. Here, we predicted the dynamic rearrangements of S2 subunits underpinning the transition from pre- to postfusion structures based on Western blot analysis of the 67- and 69-kDa by-products that are induced following trypsin digestion of the S protein.",

These invariant MHV-2 S protein motifs are assumed not to change conformation and are displayed as a fixed globule represented by a gray column in Fig. 11. The flexible regions in the S2 subunit that undergo conformational changes are positioned in the FP region (residues 867 to 949) and the HR1 region (residues 954 to 1072), as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the region downstream of the core \u03b2-sheet (residues 1155 to 1302) that includes the HR2 region also appears to be flexible (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "In the present and previous studies, we observed eight features related to conformational changes that occur in the flexible regions of the S2 subunit. The first four features are induced by receptor binding. (i) During the first step, the S protein binds to the target membrane, as demonstrated by liposome-binding assays in a previous study (26) and negative-stain EM in this study (Fig. 10Dii). Because the FP region is located close to \u03b248, at least one \u03b248 per trimer must be dissociated from \u03b247 in invariant motifs for the FP region to be free. It is important to remember that the exact location of the FP region of coronavirus S protein remains controversial. The FP region (residues 867 to 949) immediately follows an S2\u2032 cleavage site (40), and another possible FP region (pFP; residues 967 to 983) is adjacent to the region upstream of HR1 (Fig. 4), as reported previously (41, 42). (ii) The metastable form of the S protein trimer is converted to a stable trimer (Fig. 6A, VHCR, lane 3), for which the dissociation temperature was increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C (Fig. 9C). During this stage, the movement of HR1 to form a trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil on the distal side of the viral membrane is restricted because the S2 subunit is still covered by the S1 subunit in the uncleaved S protein (Fig. 10Aii). Therefore, regions at \u03b129 and \u03b130 (the central helix) are only capable of interacting within the trimer (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with a previous study in which the tightly packed central helix in the S2 subunit was detected by cryoEM after the receptor-binding step (4, 6). (iii) The 106 amino acids of the connector region (residues 1155 to 1260, Fig. 4A), including the 10G epitope and disulfide bond at positions 1169 and 1214, presumably form a folded structure because the 10G epitope in the trimer was undetectable in the native blot (Fig. 6A, 10G, lane 3) and was resistant to trypsin even in the presence of HR2-mimicking peptide (Fig. 8A). Reduction of the gap between the S protein globule and the viral membrane (\u223c200 \u00c5) in EM images (Fig. 10Bii and Cii) may reflect a folded C-terminal side of the S2 subunit. In addition, the 10G region is likely fixed near helix \u03b129 at the top of the S2 trimer to allow 6HB assembly in the following step (11). These observations indicate that, in the S protein structure appearing after the receptor-binding step, the core of the connector leash is packed into the groove of the invariant motif (Fig. 11Aii, purple lines), as seen in the postfusion structure (11). (iv) The HR1/HR2 motif forms the packed-hairpin structure observed as the 67-kDa subunit after trypsin treatment that is unable to interact with HR2-mimicking peptide (Fig. 8A, lane 13, and Fig. 8G, lane 2). Based on the steric configuration of the postfusion structure, HR1 of one S2 subunit must be packed with HR2 of another S2 subunit in the trimer to form a hairpin structure (11). In addition, unpacked HR1, observed as the 69-kDa band that was degraded following treatment with HR2-mimicking peptide and trypsin (Fig. 8G, lane 2), also appeared in this step. Interestingly, both 69- and 67-kDa subunits were present in the trimer, as revealed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 5Cb), suggesting that a subset of S2 subunits form a heterogeneous trimer constructed from two different conformational states. We predict that the trimer includes at least one packed HR1/HR2 motif and extends at least one unpacked HR1 motif toward the target membrane to expose the FP region, and the S2 subunit is covered by the S1 subunit in the uncleaved S protein (Fig. 11Aii). These features suggest that the S protein cannot form the typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure predicted in the current model of class I viral fusion protein assembly (Fig. 11B).",

(v) The S1/S2 site is cleaved by trypsin to generate the 90-kDa subunit (Fig. 1C, lane 7, and Fig. 7A, lane 2), and the S2\u2032 site is subsequently cleaved by trypsin to generate the 69-kDa subunit (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 to 16). Release of the S1 subunit from the S2 subunit presumably enhances interactions within three S2 subunits and triggers conformational changes in the HR1/HR2 motifs. (vi) All three HR1/HR2 motifs in the trimer appear to form a packed-hairpin structure at 1 min after warming at 37\u00b0C, because HR2-mimicking peptide cannot interact with them (Fig. 8G, lane 3). (vii) Simultaneously, the three HR1/HR2 motifs assemble at the center to form a 6HB core at 1 min after trypsin treatment (Fig. 7A, bottom, lane 3). At this stage, the dissociation temperature of the trimer was \u223c90\u00b0C (Fig. 9C). (viii) The postS2\u2032 cleavage site in \u03b248 is finally cleaved by trypsin after assembly of the three HR motifs at the center, resulting in the appearance of the 67-kDa subunit (Fig. 9C bottom). The final 6HB structure is constructed from 67- and 69-kDa subunits or three 67-kDa subunits (Fig. 5Cb). Numerous elongated cone-like structures were observed by EM (Fig. 10Av).",

This conformation presumably facilitates formation of an asymmetric trimer. In principle, the class I viral fusion protein trimer must break its rotational symmetry during activation to overcome the steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits (43, 44). When the different conformational states of the HR1/HR2 motif assemble in the trimer, the axis of the trimer is presumably tilted against the viral membrane (Fig. 11Avii), resulting in the breaking of rotational symmetry. This is followed by formation of 6HB and membrane fusion. Flexibility at the juxtamembrane region and the tilted orientation against the viral membrane required for membrane fusion were recently reported by a study examining influenza HA in detergent micelles analyzed by cryoEM (45). We anticipate that the mechanism suggested by Western blot analysis here will be confirmed by other approaches such as high-resolution cryoEM and/or in silico simulation.",
