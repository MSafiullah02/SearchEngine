In light of the demonstrable lack of personal and societal protections evidenced by the current cholera outbreak, and chronic deficiencies in the space, systems, staff, and stuff to meet routine healthcare needs, the potential to meet added demands for EVD preparation are widely perceived as unrealistic. Healthcare workers at most institutions in Ghana do not receive workers\u2019 compensation, disability or life insurance, risk allowances, or supplemental health insurance. The threat of EVD increased demands for employers to provide these, and personal advocacy may account for some of the frontline responses.",

            "text": "A final goal for the meeting was to explore opportunities for action, recognizing that an interdisciplinary, multi-level effort is needed to build resiliency, as the United Nations has defined it in the context of disaster risk reduction [11]. EVD transmission can clearly be stopped through rapid mobilization for case and contact finding, early medical care using adequate PPE and environmental controls, and preventive interventions [12]. To do these things requires commitment, confidence, and trust between communities, healthcare workers, and government. Based on the above discussion themes the panel developed the following initial recommendations:Prioritize strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) in facilities, including reliable water and electricity. This is an urgent priority for both short and long-term investment. In particular, there should be adequate access to and proper training in the use of PPE for all healthcare workers, and that training should be followed up with structured programs for supervision, monitoring and evaluation. IPC is a critical aspect of EVD prevention, and should be particularly important as a focus for systems strengthening given the endemicity of cholera and tuberculosis in Ghana [6]. Investing in this critical competency is equally essential to build staff confidence and trust in leadership\u2019s commitment to quality care and their own occupational health and safety. The risk of an EVD patient escaping detection at triage seems considerable in light of the non-specific nature of symptoms, the experiences in Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Senegal where index patients did not initially disclose their EVD contacts, and the likelihood that - looking to the future - the next outbreak will come unannounced.Provide assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers. Specifically, healthcare workers should have guaranteed health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and disability insurance should they contract EVD in the process of screening and providing care to patients. The needs of their families should also be addressed, including options for isolation of healthcare workers outside of the home to protect their families from becoming infected. Stories of abandonment and violence toward frontline healthcare workers in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone fuel staff insecurities and are a barrier to continued quality care in Ghana as evidenced by the reactions to EVD suspects in various health facilities to date. Conversely, making sure that nurses had their home needs met was an important factor in maintaining health systems integrity in Canada during the SARS pandemic [13].Establish a continuous surveillance system to monitor and document all suspected cases and contacts in the community. This should take advantage of existing local resources such as the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), and the epidemiological surveillance programs at University of Ghana School of Public Health in addition to those run though the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service. It should be well linked to and coordinated within an active network of multiagency multi-sector community and local government partners capable of responding not only to a projected EVD outbreak, but to regularly recurring outbreaks such as cholera that frequently destabilize health and health systems in Ghana [10].Develop a coordinated and consistent education on EVD transmission and the current epidemic. The educational messages should be co-produced with the community leaders, organizations, work unions, frontline healthcare workers and other community-based organizations. Poor health literacy and information access in communities, and even among healthcare workers, contributes to fear and mistrust. Public health officials in Uganda cite massive public education as a key determinant in their success containing multiple viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks [14]. Messages should have two very important attributes. First, they should demystify the disease by focusing on the science of what works to control spread. Second, they should highlight the various stories of resiliency and positive case examples such as survivors\u2019 stories and the successful responses in Uganda, Nigeria, and Senegal. This education is critical to combat the erroneous perception that EVD defies control, to decrease fear and stigma, and to encourage care-seeking. However, as studies of risk perception suggest, the communication must be bi-directional and contextual to be effective [15]. We need go to the communities and ask what their members understand, what fears they harbor, what practical challenges and concerns they have to implement the key recommendations, and how they think the issues should be addressed. This is the core aim of co-production. Engaging with local religious and community leaders early and often to develop acceptable solutions in context has been a vital component of successful EVD containment strategies in the past [16-18]. Enlisting the media as allies should also be of critical importance.",

Clearly massive outside assistance is needed to contain the current EVD epidemic, yet the critical roles of local leadership and communities cannot be overemphasized. The current crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity for West African countries not yet affected to make advances on creating culturally and contextually relevant solutions to build resiliency and strengthen health systems for outbreak control. This will require significant investment and support to raise standards of hygiene and protection in communities and healthcare facilities, to build mechanisms for coordination and collaboration across sectors, and to enlist the people on the frontline - in families, communities, and healthcare facilities - as allies in the process.",
