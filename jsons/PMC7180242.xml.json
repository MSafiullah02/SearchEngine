Because infections with respiratory pathogens often result in symptoms that overlap between many causative agents, a definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Therefore, the approach of syndromic testing has been widely adopted, with testing for multiple agents of upper respiratory infection at the same time with a single test. This panel-based approach can simplify ordering and laboratory workflow while improving sensitivity and time to result compared to older, conventional testing methods.",

The rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections also can shorten times in the emergency room, decrease length of stay, or prevent hospitalization and allow improved patient cohorting to prevent nosocomial infections (3, 5\u20139).",

Each QIAstat-DX RP cartridge is run on an analyzer that consists of at least one analytical module for individual cartridge loading and one operational module with touchscreen and integrated software. Up to 4 analytical modules can be connected with one operational module (Fig. 1). The following pathogen types and subtypes are identified: adenovirus; coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; human metapneumovirus A and B; influenza A; influenza A H1; influenza A H3; influenza A H1N1/2009; influenza B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; rhinovirus/enterovirus; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; Bordetella pertussis; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Of the 251 influenza A-positive detections, a total of 248 (98.8%) had additional subtype-specific detections (85 specific detections for H1N1 2009 and 163 for H3). There were no detections of seasonal H1N1. Three (1.2%) influenza A positives had no associated specific detections. This could be due to virus levels below the limit of detection for the type-specific assays. However, it indicates the detection of a novel influenza A type, and this should be considered when seen in clinical use (17, 18). For FLU B virus, there is a single target designed to detect the two sublineages of the virus (B/Victoria/2/87-like [Victoria lineage] and B/Yamagata/16/88-like [Yamagata lineage]). There were 7 FN results with the QIAstat-Dx RP and 1 with FARPv1.7, which may reflect differences in sensitivity related to the viral strains. Because the comparator does not provide any semiquantitative value, it is difficult to determine the relative level of virus in the 7 QIAstat-Dx FN; however, the 1 FN for the FARPv1.7 had a CT value of 20.4, suggesting it did have a significant amount of virus present.",

The most common of the bacterial targets was M. pneumoniae, with 24 detections, more than the 19 detected with FARPv1.7. However, it should be noted that the use of an NP specimen for the detection of M. pneumoniae may be suboptimal, particularly when diagnosing lower-respiratory-tract infection (20, 21). For B. pertussis, discrepancies between the QIAstat-Dx RP and the comparator method were not unexpected, as the QIAstat-Dx RP targets the multicopy insertion sequence (IS481) that is present in several Bordetella species (B. pertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica), whereas the comparator targets the single-copy promoter region of the pertussis toxin gene and is designed to be specific to the detection of B. pertussis. The use of the single-copy toxin gene target has been shown to be less sensitive than the use of IS481 (22, 23). The assay used for discordant analysis calls out the individual Bordetella species (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. holmesii). The B. pertussis target is also the toxin promoter region and, thus, would be a single-copy gene. A total of 6 QIAstat-Dx RP FP results were found for B. pertussis for both arms of the study (Table 4). Five of these samples were available for further analysis; only one was confirmed using the discordant testing with a CT value of 31.6. In examining the CT values for all the detections in the clinical trial, the discordant detections had a significantly higher median CT value than the concordant positive detections (TP median CT, 26.2; FP median CT, 33.0; P = 0.008) (Table S1). Thus, some of the FP may have been missed by both the comparator and discordant analysis assays based on the lower sensitivity of a single-copy gene target.",

Similar findings have been reported for other multiplex respiratory panels (16, 19).

Compared to FARPv1.7, QIAstat-Dx RP involves only one step to pipette the specimen into the cartridge for loading, as there is no buffer added or any other manipulations required. This lessens manipulation and may help to reduce contamination. The run times are similar, lasting, on average, 69 and 63 min for the QIAstat-Dx RP and FARPv1.7, respectively. Both platforms allow for testing of one pouch at a time per module. In terms of reliability, the initial rate of invalid or no results on first testing for the prospective samples was 4.1% and after a second test was 0.7%. This invalid rate is comparable to those of other multiplex platforms currently available (16). A significant benefit of the system is that it allows the user to obtain a CT value for each detected pathogen and the internal control. The comparator assay does not allow the user to see CT values. These values, while not truly quantitative, do allow a semiquantitative assessment of target amounts that can be useful in troubleshooting or other quality control measures.",

However, data indicated that the frozen storage did not significantly affect performance (11). The study period bridges 17 months and includes two respiratory seasons; however, variations in circulating strains, particularly influenza A viruses, may be limited. Because the prevalence of some analytes was low in the prospective cohort, frozen retrospective samples were used to increase the numbers for positive detections. As stated above, freeze-thawing did not appear to affect performance in terms of prevalence. However, for the retrospective samples, all were tested with both the test and comparator assays on the same freeze-thaw cycle to remove this as a confounder. Overall, the percentage of discrepant results versus the comparator methods was low.",
