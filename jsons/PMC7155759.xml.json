Several Orthopaedic and Surgical Societies and Associations have issued the guidelines for their members to follow during this pandemic [1\u20133]. The salient features of these guidelines are to:Only the absolute emergency cases are to be operated upon.Non-emergency cases should be treated non-operatively, as far as possible.Avoid unnecessary hospital visits of the patients and encourage doing telemedicine consultations, as far as possible.Take maximum degree of universal precautions yourself, during the hospital work and also protect the other healthcare professionals working with you.",

Most countries have enforced severe restrictions in their respective zones to contain the menace of this disease. It surely feels like a world-war situation. The frontline soldiers in this battle against the Novel Corona Virus are the healthcare workers (doctors, nurses and other medical staff). It is becoming obvious that the incidence of infection in these frontline health workers is rampant across many countries, to the extent that several deaths have also been reported amongst them. There are several reasons for making the healthcare workers more susceptible to this disease: (a) overstretched health care facilities, (b) acute shortage of essential equipments like respirator masks, PPE, and ventilators, (c) high viral load in the hospitals. Sadly, these \u2018brave soldiers of the society are also facing social ostracisation from their landlords and society [5].",

There has been an acute shortage of these essential PPEs for them and providing them with substandard PPEs (similar to rain coats!) is not the solution to overcome the crisis.
