            "text": "The demonstration that caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan and delays many aspects of aging in rodents (Weindruch & Walford, 1988; Weindruch & Sohal, 1997) has been a major source of new ideas and discoveries in biogerontology, and it is commonly asserted that the CR diet is the only well\u2010authenticated method for delaying aging in mammals. In the last 10 years, however, studies of F344 and other rat strains (Orentreich et al., 1993; 2004, 1994; Zimmerman et al., 2003) have shown that maximal lifespan can be extended by diets in which cystine and cysteine are absent and methionine levels are as low as possible. Rats fed this methionine\u2010restricted (Meth\u2010R) diet are light in weight, but consume more total calories per gram body weight than control rats (Meth\u2010C) fed a diet with higher levels of methionine (Orentreich et al., 1993). Maximum lifespan of F344 inbred rats is extended by about 45% in at least two independent studies (Orentreich et al., 1993; Richie et al., 1994), and there is suggestive preliminary evidence (Zimmerman et al., 2003) that the Meth\u2010R diet extends lifespan in at least three other rat stocks that are not subject to the nephropathy and testicular tumors that characterize the F344 stock. Pair\u2010feeding studies, in which rats are fed the Meth\u2010C diet at the levels consumed by the Meth\u2010R rat group, have shown that the lifespan extension seen in the Meth\u2010R rats is not attributable to their slightly lower per\u2010rat energy intake. It is thus an open question as to what degree the mechanisms that lead to lifespan extension in Meth\u2010R rats overlap the pathways that extend life and delay age\u2010associated pathology in CR rodents. Nor is it clear whether the ability of low methionine diets to extend lifespan is limited to rats, or in contrast can be shown in other laboratory species of interest.",

Control mice were fed a semi\u2010purified diet similar in all respects except that it contained 0.43% methionine by weight. Methionine levels for the experimental group were increased to 0.12% when the mice reached 4 months of age, and again to 0.15% when the mice were 6 months of age, in an effort to reduce the proportion of experimental mice dying as a consequence of rectal prolapse. The experimental diet remained at 0.15% for the duration of the experiment. To test the hypothesis that reduction of methionine content from 0.43% to 0.15% reduced the palatability of the food, we conducted a short\u2010term experiment in which food consumption was measured daily for five consecutive days in two cages of young adult female mice on the control diet, and in two cages of mice receiving the experimental diet; five cage\u2010days were omitted when food shredding made it impossible to measure consumption accurately in a specific cage. Mice given the control diet consumed an average of 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 g day\u22121 (mean \u00b1 SD), as compared with 4.3 \u00b1 1.1 g day\u22121 for mice receiving the restricted diet. These data provide no evidence for the idea that the low\u2010methionine food is less palatable than the control diet. Because both groups of mice were equivalent in body weight at the start (29.3 \u00b1 2.3 g) and end (28.8 \u00b1 1.9 g) of this 5\u2010day period, the data are consistent with previous reports, from rat studies, that animals on the low\u2010methionine diet consume at least as much food per gram body weight as controls.",

The left panel includes all of the mice entered into the study, and the right panel shows survival patterns for mice that were alive at the age of 365 days. It is clear that the experimental group had a higher risk of death in the first year of the protocol, but that this effect was diminished when methionine levels were raised to 0.15%. Survival at ages beyond 365 days was much higher in mice receiving the Meth\u2010R diet. The log\u2010rank test found the difference between the two groups significant at P = 0.02 when all mice were considered, and at P < 0.0002 when only those surviving more than 365 days were considered. At the time of writing (February 2005), 2/40 mice (5%) from the Meth\u2010R group are still alive, and none of the 40 mice in the control group. The longest\u2010lived mouse in the control group died at the age of 1150 days, an age at which 12/40 (30%) of the mice in the Meth\u2010R group were still alive. Maximum lifespan of the control mice, estimated as the mean age of the oldest 10% to die (1144 \u00b1 26 days, mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4), is significantly less (P < 0.002 by Student's t\u2010test) than the corresponding value for the restricted mice (1261 \u00b1 32 days, a minimum estimate with 5% of the mice still living).",

MIF mRNA was also found to be elevated by microarray testing in liver of young adult mice of a long\u2010lived growth hormone receptor knockout stock (Miller et al., 2002a), and by RT\u2010PCR in liver of mice of the long\u2010lived wild\u2010derived Idaho stock (Y.

Because MIF mRNA was elevated in each of these four varieties of long\u2010lived mice, we used RT\u2010PCR to estimate MIF mRNA levels in female CB6F1 mice after 5 months of exposure to the methionine\u2010deficient diet. CR mice, and controls for both diets, were evaluated in parallel. The results are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3. Liver of Meth\u2010R mice has higher concentrations of MIF mRNA (P < 0.004) than liver of age\u2010matched mice on the control diet. The CR diet also leads to an increase in liver MIF mRNA concentration, confirming the original array\u2010based analyses.

In some cases autolysis was too far advanced to permit a diagnosis, and in one case two disease processes were deemed contributory to death. Of the remaining 20 cases in the control group, four were deemed to have died of histiocytic sarcoma, six of lymphoma, four of other neoplasias (hemangiosarcoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma and Schwann cell tumor), and six of non\u2010neoplastic diseases (inanition, peritonitis, pituitary adenoma, pyometra, heart failure and amyloidosis). Among the 11 diagnosable cases in the methionine\u2010restricted group, there were three cases of histiocytic sarcoma, five of lymphoma, one gastric adenocarcinoma and two deaths from non\u2010neoplastic causes (thrombus and hemorrhage). The necropsy series excluded mice dying prior to 1 year of age; thus mean age of death in the diagnosable cases was 876 days for the control mice and 921 days for the methionine\u2010restricted mice. Although this small case series does not permit a comprehensive picture of late life illness in methionine\u2010restricted mice, it supports the inference that mice on the restricted diet succumb to the same spectrum of illnesses seen in the control mice, although at later ages. The extent of lesions at the glomerular basement membrane could be evaluated in 27 control and 15 Meth\u2010R mice, and were scored on a scale of 0\u20133, with high scores representing more severe lesions.

Rats on the Meth\u2010R diet weigh 40% less than controls, but consume only 10% less food, and rats provided with a control diet in the same amount (per rat) as consumed by the Meth\u2010R rats show only modest weight loss and minimal lifespan extension (Orentreich et al., 1993). Our own informal observations of Meth\u2010R mice suggest that they eat more food than mice on the control diet, and urine output of the Meth\u2010R mice is much higher than for controls, presumably due to the osmotic demands of excreting nutrients that cannot be incorporated into protein due to limiting levels of methionine and/or cyst(e)ine. A short\u2010term food consumption trial showed that mice placed on the low\u2010methionine diet eat as much food as mice placed on the (control) diet with higher levels of methionine, refuting the idea that the low\u2010methionine food source was so unpalatable that the mice lost weight because of voluntary food restriction.",

(3) Is the longevity effect seen only in mice whose genes have been selected for laboratory confinement, or would it be demonstrable as well in wild\u2010derived mouse stocks, which are longer\u2010lived than laboratory\u2010adapted strains (2000, 2002b)? (4) What is the optimal regimen for lifespan extension by Meth\u2010R diets? For example, can longevity be improved by methionine\u2010restriction that is initiated not at 6 weeks of age but at later ages, and would such a system mitigate the early life mortality risks noted in Fig. 1? Would there be advantages to a protocol in which methionine was limited in the first half of the lifespan, but then provided at \u2018normal\u2019 levels as the mice enter old age? (5) Are the effects of the Meth\u2010R diet additive to those produced by CR? Would a diet that combined methionine restriction (at some level) with caloric restriction produce a longevity effect that exceeded what could be produced with either intervention alone?",

One set of models would emphasize the similarities in endocrine profiles, and perhaps cellular properties, shared by Meth\u2010R and CR rodents. Thus, for example, declines in IGF\u2010I and T4, lower glucose, lower insulin and (by hypothesis) improved insulin sensitivity might be induced by either diet and lead, through unknown intermediate steps, to slower aging and resistance to multiple diseases. More generally, each diet might be imagined to induce a mild stress response, perhaps accompanied by mild increases in chronic levels of glucocorticoids (Sabatino et al., 1991) and compensatory increases in MIF that along with other unknown factors modulate aging and disease risks.",

There is some evidence that dietary restriction of tryptophan can also extend lifespan and delay some signs of aging in rats (Segall & Timiras, 1976; Ooka et al., 1988), an effect unlikely to reflect the alterations in sulfur metabolism produced by diets low in methionine. Rates of protein synthesis and degradation both decline with age, a decline that is itself diminished by a CR diet (Van Remmen et al., 1995). Diets low in methionine or in tryptophan might lead to a decline in protein synthesis rate, which in turn might induce compensatory mechanisms that protect against some forms of age\u2010related cellular dysfunctions. Studies of the effects of amino\u2010acid\u2010deficient diets, as well as long\u2010lived mutant mouse stocks (Miller, 2001), on rates of protein turnover and post\u2010translational status could be very rewarding.",

It seems likely that some of the connections between methionine restriction and aging overlap with the still\u2010obscure mechanisms of caloric restriction, and others, perhaps, with the pathways that lengthen life in IGF\u2010I\u2010deficient mouse mutants. We are currently undertaking studies of gene expression patterns and DNA methylation patterns to improve our picture of how Meth\u2010R and CR mice may differ from one another, and to provide insights into the way in which these interventions might alter aging rate in mammals.",
