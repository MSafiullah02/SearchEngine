It is an internet-based interactive platform for children and adolescents that is intended to improve their overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform includes different dimensions, such as disease prevention and treatment, child health communication and science popularization, improvement of children's mental health, and increment of family and community cohesion. Experts which are served on this platform include pediatricians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, musicians, artists, and educators on school health, as a joint team to provide health service.",

More than 200 doctors specialized in child health care from diversified specialties, including pediatric psychiatry, have been serving online in turn for 12 hours on a daily basis, from 8 am to 8 pm. Questions from 32 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China have been submitted to the platform within the first month of operation. Answers were always given promptly online\u2014within 8 minutes in the first week of service. By collecting queries from children and their families, professionals also could spot their needs and thus adjust emergency policies of the hospital and the society as a whole in response. The free online live webcast is another program sought after by users in the project. Experts elaborated on selected topics around children\u2019s well-being during the live webcast. Utilizing advanced internet and cloud technology, the platform can support multiple live webcasts simultaneously. One live webcast on March 18 hosted by 60 experts from 10 various specialized fields attracted nearly 20,000 online visits within 2 hours. Real-time medical consulting by texting were provided during the 2-hour live webcast to answer questions from the viewers, and frequently asked questions were answered orally and directly.",

It also informs users of child health management, healthy physical growth, and mental health improvement in various forms, such as text, pictures, videos, audiobooks, and webinars. What\u2019s more, it takes advantage of music for soothing emotions, art classes to reduce children\u2019s feeling of boredom when being kept to stay home, and tailor-made videos to guide physical activities at home. For those who suffer from anxiety and stress, professional assessment tools are also available on the platform.",

To make the project live up to its full potential, we plan to expand the assessment of users\u2019 needs, to perform thorough user analysis, to prepare better online educational materials and to further evaluate effects, making sure that all such steps abide by the standard health communication process and thus enlarge the positive impact of the project. We are exploring a system and structure that allow medical institutions to join hands with various social sectors by playing up their respective resources and advantages to launch health communication to users. This system may provide insights and experience for the future establishment of health communication channels to the general public under emergent public health conditions.",
