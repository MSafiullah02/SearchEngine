            "text": "Canine parvovirus infection occurs worldwide in domestic dogs and wild canids. Incidence is higher in animal shelters, pet stores, and breeding kennels. Although CPV\u20102 can affect all breeds of dogs at any age, severe infection is most common in puppies between 6 weeks and 4 months old (Hueffer et al., 2003). The disease condition has been complicated further due to emergence of a number of variants, namely CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b and CPV\u20102c over the years and involvement of domestic and wild canines (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Martella et al., 2004). In absence of suitable antiviral therapy to protect the dogs against CPV infection, supportive treatment is the only option to reduce the mortality due to this disease. Therapeutic efficacy of recombinant feline interferon \u2010\u03c9 and recombinant canine granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor has been evaluated in CPV, but there are limitations like commercially nonavailability in all the places and exorbitant price make these therapeutics for regular use (De Mari, Maynard, Eun, & Lebreux, 2003; Duffy, Dow, Ogilvie, Rao, & Hackett, 2010; Mylonakis, Kalli, & Rallis, 2016). Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, has also been tried for the treatment of CPV without any substantial benefit in terms of survival or duration of hospitalization (Savigny & Macintire, 2010).",

            "text": "In recent years, oxidative stress has been paid much attention due to its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases (Beck, Handy, & Levander, 2000; Schwarz, 1996; Valyi\u2010Nagy & Dermody, 2005). The oxidative stress occurs due to imbalance of production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species or neutralizing antioxidant enzymes (Kim, Kim, & Hahm, 2012; Lykkesfeldt & Svendsen, 2007). Free radical\u2010induced oxidative stress causes oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of erythrocyte cell membrane, which results in lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA), the principal and most studied product of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation, is a classical marker of free radical\u2010induced cell damage (Del Rio, Stewart, & Pellegrini, 2005; Kuhn & Borchert, 2002). Determination of MDA in plasma indicates the degree of lipid peroxidation and the concentration of free oxygen radicals indirectly (Deger, Deger, Bicek, Ozdal, & Gul, 2009). Nitric oxide (NO), another essential messenger molecule under physiological concentrations, becomes a free radical to generate peroxynitrite anion (ONOO) under excess and is considered as a marker of oxidative stress (Pacher, Beckman, & Liaudet, 2007; Pierini & Bryan, 2015). Glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST), a metabolic isozyme, plays a crucial role in defense mechanisms against oxidative injury (R\u00f6th et al., 2011). GST protects cells from oxidative stress by detoxifying the secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced when ROS react with cellular constituents (Veal, Toonem, Jones, & Morgan, 2002).",

Recently, it has been observed that parvovirus infection is linked with oxidative stress, and marked enhancement of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and poor antioxidant reserve (Luo & Qiu, 2013; Nykky, Vuento, & Gilbert, 2014; Panda, Patra, Nandi, & Swarup, 2009). In recent years, emphasis has been given on the antioxidants as the potential drugs of interest for management of viral diseases (Beck, 1998; Chandrasena et al., 2014; Crump, Langston, Rajkarnikar, & Grayson, 2013). A strong association of CPV with oxidative stress suggests incorporation of antioxidants in therapeutic regimen in canine parvoviral diarrhea may help in ameliorating the clinical signs.",

Glutathione counteracts the harmful effect of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species through both direct and indirect scavenging (Dean, Giorlando, & Berk, 2011). Antioxidant efficacy of NAC has been evaluated in hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis of dogs and other noninfectious systemic disease conditions of rat (Dean et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2011; Sadowska, Manuel\u2010Y\u2010Keenoy, & De Backer, 2007; Seguro, Poli de Figueiredo, & Shimizu, 2012; Shahripour, Harrigan, & Alexandrov, 2014; Stanislaus, Gilg, Singh, & Singh, 2005; Webster & Cooper, 2009). Recently, antioxidant effect of NAC has been reported in viral diseases including HIV and influenza (Geiler et al., 2010; Sgarbanti et al., 2014; Staal, 2000; Uchide & Toyoda, 2011). However, the antioxidant effect of NAC in dogs naturally affected with parvoviral diarrhea has not yet been explored. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of NAC in diarrheic dogs infected with canine parvovirus.",

            "text": "In this study, pronounced elevation of Hb% and RBC count in infected dogs indicates hemoconcentration during parvoviral diarrhea. The parvoviral enteritis causes anemia that is attributed to cytotoxic effect of virus on hematopoietic cells, bone marrow failure and subsequently erythroid hypoplasia during acute stages of the disease (Grimes & Fry, 2015; Nandi & Kumar, 2010; Stann, DiGiacomo, Giddens, & Evermann, 1984). In contrast, hemoconcentration in this study might be due to excessive fluid loss during the episodes of diarrhea. Furthermore, leucopenia and neutropenia are the major hemogram alterations in the parvo\u2010infected dogs (Castro et al., 2013). The leukopenia and neutropenia in parvo\u2010infected dogs could be due to destruction of hematopoietic progenitor cells of the various leukocyte types in the bone marrow, inadequate supply for the massive demand for leukocytes in the inflamed gastrointestinal tract and loss of neutrophils through the damaged gastrointestinal tract (Macartney, McCandlish, Thompson, & Cornwell, 1984; Fulton et al., 199; Goddard, Leisewitz, Christopher, Duncan, & Becker, 2008). However, the WBC count was restored on day 5 in parvo\u2010infected dogs following ST\u2010NAC treatment. In spite of progressive improvement in neutrophil count over time, neutropenia still persisted on day 5 compared with control healthy dogs. It warrants longer duration of treatment with NAC to improve the neutrophil count and health condition of the dogs. Although, there is no report on the effect of NAC to stimulate neutrophil production, however, it has been reported that NAC stimulates pluripotent stem cells to differentiate toward hematopoietic cells in laboratory animal model (Berniakovich, Laricchia\u2010Robbio, & Izpisua Belmonte, 2012). Goddard et al. (2008) opined that blood leukocyte count could be prognostic indicator of canine parvoviral enteritis or outcome of the disease.",

            "text": "Much has been learned about the beneficial effect of antioxidants against viral diseases in recent years (Beck, 2001; Peterhans, 1997; Zhang, Wang, Chen, Chen, & Tian, 2014). Studies derived from influenza virus indicated positive impact of NAC as an antioxidant molecule against viral pathogenesis (Casanova & Garigliany, 2016; Garigliany & Desmecht, 2011). In this study, a pronounced elevation of MDA and NOx and drop of GST activities in infected dogs compared to healthy dogs before initiation of therapy indicate marked oxidative stress in parvovirus infection and corroborated with the finding of other workers (Luo & Qiu, 2013; Nykky et al., 2014; Panda et al., 2009). Oxidative stress has been implicated in several viral infections in human and animals. It has been reported that parvovirus\u2010induced oxidative stress is mediated by damage of mitochondrial membrane, NS1 protein\u2010induced DNA damage besides liberation of proinflammatory cytokines (Barzilai & Yamamoto, 2004; Goddard & Leisewitz, 2010; Nykky et al., 2014). The supportive treatment alone did not succeed to reduce the level of MDA, NOx and improve the GST activities in parvo\u2010infected dogs till day 5 when compared with pretreatment values (day 0). However, inclusion of NAC in supportive treatment significantly (p < .05) reduced the MDA, NOx concentrations and increased GST activity in plasma on day 3 onward after initiation of treatment. It indicated the ameliorative potential of NAC in oxidative stress during CPV diarrhea. The NAC inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase, suppresses proinflammatory cytokine expression/release, reduces lipid peroxidation in serum and restores nonenzymatic antioxidant reserves in human and laboratory animal model (Akca et al., 2005; Caglikulekci et al., 2006; Kasperczyk et al., 2014; Ribeiro et al., 2011; Shahripour et al., 2014). Furthermore, NAC supplementation significantly reduced the plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) in acetic acid (AA)\u2010induced ulcerative colitis of rat model and stabilized erythrocyte glutathione concentrations and decreased the degree of lipid peroxidation in sick dogs that experience systemic oxidative stress during the first 48 hr of hospitalization (Kurutas, Cetinkaya, Bulbuloglu, & Kantarceken,2005; Viviano & Wielen, 2013). Recently, Geiler et al. (2010) observed NAC inhibits the virus replication and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine gene expression during influenza virus infection. The beneficial effects of NAC have been reported in highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and rotavirus\u2010associated diarrhea (Dekhuijzen, 2004; Garigliany & Desmecht, 2011; Guerrero, Torres, Garc\u00eda, Guerrero, & Acosta, 2014). From the findings of this study, it can be concluded that antioxidants like NAC represent a potential additional treatment option that could be considered in the case of parvoviral diarrhea. However, the therapeutic efficacy of NAC involving large number of dogs with parvovirus infection needs further study to extract the full potential of the compounds with comprehensive results.",
