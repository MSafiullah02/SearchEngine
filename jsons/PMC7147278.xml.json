Initial studies showed its regeneration number, R0, was 2.2 to 2.9,[5-7] meaning that each infector could transmit to another 2.2 to 2.9 people. Recently a novel study revealed that the R0 of 2019-nCoV is 3.77 based on clinical and epidemiological data from nearly 8866 patients in 30 provinces,[8] which is higher than the R0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (R0, 2\u20133).[9]",

In this study, we found that the viral RNA can be detected in the stool of 81.8% (54/66) patients, even in those with negative results from throat swabs. The continuous detection of viral nucleic acids in feces suggests that the virus may be transmitted through the digestive tract or re-transmitted through aerosols containing viruses. Therefore, it is necessary urgently to standardize the stool transport process of COVID-19 patients to reduce risk of further transmission. Moreover, viral RNA detection in fecal samples should be applied regularly in patients with COVID-19, even during the recovery period. Transmission by urine or blood may occur less frequently because of the low rate of positive findings in patients.",

            "text": "Glucocorticoids have been widely used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and are now also used in conjunction with other drugs to treat patients infected with 2019-nCoV. However, in the published clinical management opinions for the COVID-19, the application of glucocorticoids is not recommended unless there are other indications.[13,14] The use of glucocorticoids may delay the clearance of viral nucleic acids in patients and should be avoided during viral replication. Some bias exists in our study because the patients in the glucocorticoid treatment group had more severe disease and lower CD4+ T lymphocytes counts. Our point is that mild patients are not recommended glucocorticoid treatment, which may delay virus clearance. The randomized controlled double-blind experiments with expanded sample sizes will help clarify this issue. T cell immunity may play an important role in 2019-nCoV infection. The absolute values of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CRP, ESR, and PCT measured upon admission were analyzed with respect to virus clearance. The lower the absolute value of CD4+ T lymphocytes before treatment, the longer duration of virus clearance. The relationship between the fecal viral RNA results and inflammatory indicators of patients were analyzed and no statistical difference in ESR, CRP, or PCT during rehabilitation was found.",
