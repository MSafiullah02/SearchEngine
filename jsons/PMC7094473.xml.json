The HPS is a realistic representation of human respiration. It contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). The lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation and has been applied in previous studies15, 16, 17, 18, 19 to simulate human respiration.",

We assumed the intensity of the laser light sheet was constant (Figure 2, middle, B) because the mask was positioned relatively far from the optics. Scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet was collected and integrated by the video camera charge-coupled device element (Figure 2, bottom, C). For a small region, the number of smoke particles within the region (or the particle concentration) is proportional to the total scattered light intensity in that small region if each particle scatters an equal intensity of light. This is true when particles are monodisperse, as scattering is dependent on particle size.23 For most types of smoke, the particles are essentially monodisperse with a tight size distribution.20, 24 This analysis was based on the scattered light intensity being proportional to the particle concentration under the special conditions of constant-intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse small (submicrometer) particles.",

The plume of the mask exhaust holes was directed vertically upward, and there was some leakage from around the nasal bridge. The leakage jet plume was actually most extensive about 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane. This is attributable to the fact that the six deliberate exhaust holes on the mask were positioned lateral to the median sagittal plane (Figure 1).",

Again, the leakage jet plume from the mask exhaust holes was near vertical, but it had risen by 0.15 m because there was no longer a pressure drop from nasal bridge leakage. The plume was widened and pronounced at a distance between 0.1 and 0.4 m above the mask, but the jet directly from the exhaust holes was not strongly indicated. This is because the mask exhaust holes are not aligned on the sagittal plane. As the laser light sheet was focused on the sagittal plane, it did not detect the jet plume until it widened sufficiently to enter the light sheet, some distance above the mask. Based on both panels of Figure 4, we can identify the zones of safety for the probability of exposure to the patient's exhaled air in this scenario.",

The leakage jet plume was most significant at approximately 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane. Despite what initially appeared to be a reasonably well-fitted mask, there was still leakage detected at the nasal bridge. With the elimination of this nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume radial distance from the mask increased to 0.4 m, whereas exposure probability was highest at approximately 0.28 m above the patient and the mask. When IPAP was increased to 14 cm H2O and then to 18 cm H2O, the vertical plume extended to 0.42 and 0.45 m, respectively, above the patient and the mask, with some horizontal spreading along the ceiling. These findings have important clinical implications for HCWs, who often nurse their patients at a close distance, especially during NPPV support for respiratory failure at a stage when the viral loads of the patients may reach peak levels. Our study emphasizes the importance of medical ward design in terms of a ventilated, aerodynamic space and the need for an \u201carchitectural aerodynamics\u201d approach in order to minimize the risk of nosocomial infection. Air-conditioning or extraction systems will need to target the circular region that is above the mask rather than at the actual mask level.",

Treatment with NPPV was applied via oronasal masks to 20 SARS patients without COPD in whom severe hypoxemic respiratory failure developed in a hospital ward environment with efficient room air exchange, stringent infection control measures, full personal protective equipment, and the addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the exhalation port of the NPPV device.5 Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%) who had a much shorter ICU LOS than those who were intubated. Clinical evidence of SARS did not develop in any of the 105 HCWs involved in the management of the 20 patients, whereas 102 HCWs (97%) had negative SARS serology findings.5 As there were still three HCWs who had refused to undergo blood testing, one cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of subclinical SARS infection related to use of NPPV, although it seemed highly unlikely.30 Subclinical SARS infection did occur in other HCWs who cared for SARS patients.34, 35\n",

            "text": "NPPV should be applied in patients with severe viral pneumonia only if there is adequate protection for HCWs because of the potential risk of viral transmission via deliberate or accidental mask interface leakage and flow compensation causing the dispersion of a contaminated aerosol.30 In patients with chronic respiratory failure who are receiving NPPV via nasal masks, air leakage through the mouth or other routes besides the exhalation valve can occur.2 In clinical practice, pressure necrosis often develops at the skin around the nasal bridge if the mask is applied tightly for a prolonged period of time. Many patients loosen the mask strap to relieve discomfort, and air leakage from the nasal bridge is definitely a potential source for the transmission of viral infections. Careful mask fitting is important for the successful and safe application of NPPV. The addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the NPPV breathing system between the mask and the exhalation port3, 5 or the use of a dual-circuit NPPV device may reduce the risk of the nosocomial transmission of viral infection. However, the use of viral-bacterial filters was difficult due to blockage by moist secretions and could be applied only in some cases.3, 5 In view of our observation that higher ventilator pressures result in a wider dispersion of exhaled air and a higher concentration of air leakage, we recommend starting NPPV with low IPAP level (ie, 8 to 10 cm H2O) and gradually increasing the level as necessary, instead of starting high and titrating downward if the patient is intolerant.41\n",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, smoke particles were used as markers for exhaled air, but they might not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission. Our results indicate the spatial extent of the airflow leakage jet plumes but do not directly indicate the behavior of potentially infected droplets themselves. It is known that droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing range from 0.5 to 12 \u03bcm in diameter42, 43 with a density similar to that of water. As these droplets are generally much larger than smoke particles (ie, they have a higher Stokes number), they will not follow the jet plume airflow perfectly but will slip relative to air streamlines under the influence of Stokes drag and gravitational forces. Stokes drag carries droplets with the airflow of the jet plume, but inertia causes droplets to lag behind the airflow and fall short of the full extent of the air jet plume. Conversely, gravitational force causes droplets to follow trajectories that are vertically below the air jet plume. We would therefore expect droplets to extend somewhat vertically below the contours given here but less than the contours given in directions vertically above and to the sides of the jet plume. The contours and safe distances suggested here are likely the \u201cupper-bound\u201d conservative estimates for droplet spread above and to the sides of the mask. Using the laser visualization method, we have shown that during the delivery of oxygen at a rate of 4 L/min via a Hudson mask to the HPS, the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation could reach a distance of approximately 0.40 m.44 Last, we tested only one type of NPPV machine and one oronasal mask without supplemental oxygen, and did not test a nasal mask due to limited resources. Nevertheless, oronasal masks are generally preferred in the application of NPPV for acute respiratory failure as nasal masks are poorly tolerated in the acute setting due to mouth breathing.45 Further studies are needed to assess the safety of different respiratory therapies such as the addition of viral filters in the circuit, the use of supplemental oxygen, the use of a humidifier, and the use of different ward airflow settings, and to determine how the medical ward environment should be designed to protect HCWs from acquiring nosocomial pneumonia.",
