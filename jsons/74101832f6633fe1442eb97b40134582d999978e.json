            "text": "Pandas, tigers, right whales and gorillas are emblematic and charismatic species worldwide and a consensus exists for the need of their conservation. The same is true for economically important species such as salmonids and sturgeons. But do we really need the conservation of parasitic species? Not really! During our childhood, we all have favourite stuffed animals (representing one of these emblematic species) we take to sleep. However, do you ever see a child squeezing a stuffed worm, flea or tick? The lack of affect for cryptic species and the perception of parasites as disgusting creatures among the public certainly leads to a disinterest among governmental and conservation agencies to preserve them. Fortunately, in 1990, Donald A. Windsor expressed his concern for this matter in the famous slogan: \"Equal Rights for Parasites!\" (Windsor 1990 ). Five years later he pleaded once more for parasite conservation in an editorial that appeared in \"Conservation Biology\" (Windsor 1995) . During the same time, the ominous term \"co-extinction\" was proposed to characterize the dual extinction of a host and its specialized parasite (Stork and Lyal 1993) . Despite the passing of 15 years since these passionate declarations and the exponential increase of an interest in conservation biology, we can point out that parasitic species are far from being in a leading position among current conservation priorities. Very few parasites are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2003; Whiteman and Parker 2005) . Some parasite extinctions have been even intentionally provoked as revealed by the will to remove parasites from hosts in captive breeding programs (Stork and Lyal 1993) .",

            "text": "To convince resource managers that parasites are an important component of all ecosystems, the following arguments, which mainly rely on their potential utilitarian effects, are advocated by the parasites' defenders. First, parasites are living organisms and are de facto part of biodiversity. They shape community structure by reducing competitive abilities and vulnerability to predation of their hosts and have strong impact on ecosystem functioning (Hudson 2005) . Moreover, parasites could maintain biodiversity by mediating competitive interactions between different members of an ecosystem. Because the rate of molecular evolution is usually faster in parasite DNA than that within the homologous loci of their hosts (Moran et al. 1995; Nieberding et al. 2004) , the study of the evolution of parasite DNA sequences could provide valuable information on past population dynamics, evolutionary history and current demographic processes of endangered hosts (Whiteman and Parker 2005) . Parasites could thus be used as a biological \"magnifying glass\" (Nieberding et al. 2004) . Another utilitarian effect of parasites is their potential use as indicators of environ-mental quality and ecosystem health (Marcogliese 2005) . Indeed, parasites may be used as accumulation indicators of heavy metal contamination, particularly in aquatic ecosystems (Sures et al. 1999 ). In addition, parasite species and composition revealed perturbations in ecosystem structure and function (Marcogliese 2005) . Furthermore, the use of parasite in human medicine is a new promising field of investigation, as illustrated by the use of helminths as therapeutic agents for inflammatory disease (Hunter and McKay 2004 ).",

            "text": "Wild animals in their natural habitat have to cope not only with predictable environmental changes such as the cycles of seasons and their associated modifications in resource availability and temperature but also with unpredictable events such as catastrophes, spread of new diseases and human disturbances. Whereas animals react adaptively by behavioural and physiological modifications to predictable changes, unpredictable disturbances may have negative effects on population dynamics of living organisms. Increasingly rapid disappearing and fragmentation of habitats, which may be considered as unpredictable environmental changes, translates in a cascade of negative effects and can result in physiological stress on animals (Suorsa et al. 2003 (Suorsa et al. , 2004 . The first physiological responses of an animal to stressful stimuli include cardiovascular effects and a hormonal response involving synthesis and secretion of glucocorticosteroids (Romero 2004) . Consequently, a corticosteroid response might be a good indicator of a stress response (Hofer and East 1998) . It is, therefore, not surprising that corticosteroid level is measured in many studies in ecology and conservation biology that have evaluated the effect of different environmental and human perturbations on the stress level of wild animals (Creel et al. 1997; Creel et al. 2002; Mostl and Palme 2002; Romero 2004; Palme et al. 2005) . The consequences of a stress response on parasite resistance are complex and alter host immunocompetence in different ways (Apanius 1998 ). The immune system appears to be down regulated under stressful environmental conditions (von Holst 1998), particularly under severe chronic stress with prolonged periods of high cortisol concentrations (Mostl and Palme 2002) . Stress stimuli may arise due to different factors in a perturbed environment. Habitat fragmentation may be related to chronic food shortage (Zanette et al. 2000) . Thus degradation of environmental conditions may decrease resource availability that in turn affects body condition and immune defences (Chandra and Newberne 1977; Klasing 1998; Christe et al. 2003) . As body condition is usually positively correlated with immune defences , individuals with poor body condition will be especially vulnerable to attacks of parasites Christe et al. 2000) . Edge effect due to fragmentation may also be a source of stress because predators may have easy access to dense forest patches which were previously inaccessible. It has been experimentally demonstrated that exposure to predators reduced the ability of hosts to cope with parasitism mediated through effects on immune function (Navarro et al. 2004) . Consequently parasitism may be favoured in fragmented habitat through the effect of predators. Thus, parasites, which can also be considered as an environmental stressor, may reinforce the effect of habitat degradation and participate in the reduction of a population.",

The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is the major concept in host-parasite population dynamics. This quantity is defined as the number of new infections occurring after introduction of one parasite, or one infected host, into a na\u00efve and susceptible host population. R 0 is positively linked to host density in the case of direct-transmitted parasites (see Rosa in this book). Parasites, or infection, can spread in the population when R 0 >1 and as R 0 depends on host density, the condition of parasite invasion corresponds to a case when the density of host population exceeds a threshold density. Obviously, host-parasite dynamics are viewed in terms of parasite invasion or parasite invisibility. The task of disease management is then to decrease R 0 below one, i.e., below the threshold density.",

Hence, mathematical epidemiology and population dynamics are important tools for investigating thresholds and persistence of both hosts and parasites. They may help in determining the conditions to maintain a high level of parasite threshold in comparison to the host threshold.",

In contrast, widespread host species that live in high density are exposed to a wide range of parasite species that may affect drastically the population dynamics of these carnivores, suggesting that macroparasites may regulate them at least locally. These results lead to the paradox that parasite infection, and particularly that of macroparasites, is less crucial for small and isolated populations than for large populations. This paradox is apparent and resolved by considering the investment in immune defences, which is directly related to the prevalence and/or diversity of parasites as a mean to control infection (Martin et al. 2001) . Evidence comes again from comparative studies, which suggest that hosts allocate their investment in immune function as a function of their probability of exposure to parasites (M\u00f8ller and Legendre 2001; M\u00f8ller et al. 2005) . Large populations are composed of highly immunocompetent individuals and small populations of low immunocompetent ones. Hence, parasites and pathogens are threats to small and isolated populations because of poor performance of their immune system against pathogen introduction, but parasites (and parasite diversity) are probably necessary to maintain high levels of immune defence, which helps against new pathogens.",

The beneficial effects of conspecifics not only include antipredator vigilance, predator dilution, social thermoregulation, reduction of inbreeding but also social facilitation of reproduction through helpers Courchamp et al. 2000) . When population size reaches a low density, animal species that are subject to an Allee effect will suffer from a reduction in some aspects of their fitness that in turn will affect negatively growth rate of populations. Because of their potential role in extinctions of declining species, the Allee effects have thus become much studied in conservation biology Lafferty and Gerber 2002) . Interestingly, Allee effects and parasitism have several features in common that are of interest when studying population dynamics in conservation biology (Deredec 2005) . For example, theoretical models demonstrated the importance of host density in the probability for a parasite to become established in a host population (see above) and empirical studies have shown a positive relationship between host sociality or density and parasite prevalence and intensities (Anderson and May 1978; Brown and Brown 1986; M\u00f8ller et al. 1993; Stanko et al. 2002; Altizer et al. 2003) . Thus, animal species that aggregated as a behavioural response to the strong Allee effects, would be more prone to suffer the negative effects of parasites. Parasite species may also be subject to the Allee effects that influence the occurrence and the severity of epidemics as illustrated by patchy distributions of worms in hosts as a result of the necessity for female worms to find a mate in order to reproduce (Cornell et al. 2004 ).",

As a consequence of mating with a male of a non-preferred phenotype, females could decrease their parental investment resulting in poor reproductive success (M\u00f8ller and Legendre 2001) . Parasite-mediated sexual selection has been the focus of numerous studies since the influential hypothesis of Hamilton and Zuk (1982) . A meta-analysis of the available studies related to this topic has revealed a negative relationship between parasite load, immunocompetence and the expression of male secondary sexual characters (M\u00f8ller et al. 1999) .

Parasite-mediated competition is inferred when two different host species have different susceptibilities to the same non-specific parasite species. The presence of a given host species may decrease the fitness of the other host species simply by transmitting a pathogen to the more vulnerable host species (Hudson and Greenman 1998) . The abundance of the more vulnerable host to the parasite is then depleted, potentially under the host threshold. Moreover, as the parasite infects two host species, the parasite threshold is obviously low. This \"apparent\" competition, mediated via a shared pathogen, differs from the classical competition for limited resources. Strong evidence of this competition was obtained not only from experiments but also from the field (Tompkins et al. 2000) , e.g. red and grey squirrels in England (Tompkins et al. 2002b ) and pheasant and grey partridge in England (Tompkins et al. 2002a) . Parasite-mediated competition may operate for introduced host species, as they can be best competitors simply by introducing and transmitting a new parasite to the na\u00efve native species. This can lead to a non-fit combination that can be more pathogenic (Hudson and Greenman 1998; Prenter et al. 2004) . In this case, the invader uses parasites as biological weapons. Immune-na\u00efve residents will be weakened or even killed by the new pathogens.",

Hosts having evolved strong immune defences are prime candidates for successful invasion (and also more resistant towards invaders). This hypothesis was proposed in the case of introduced plants and recently for the case of introduced animals (Lee and Klasing 2004; M\u00f8ller and Cassey 2004) .

Indeed, it often leads to a decrease in population sizes as well as to the appearance of barriers to gene flow between isolated populations. The small populations that result from this fragmentation often suffer from reduction of genetic diversity associated with genetic drift and inbreeding effects. This loss of genetic variation can result in a rapid reduction of fitness (lower possibility to adapt to long term changes in environment, poor reproductive ability associated with a lower sperm quality, higher juvenile mortality, lower general survival, etc) (O'Brien 1994) . Several recent studies (Cassinello et al. 2001; Keller and Waller 2002; Spielman et al. 2004 ) also showed that populations with a low genetic variability are generally more susceptible to infectious viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. The case of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is probably one of the best known concerning this phenomenon., The two major subspecies of cheetah (A. jubatus jubatus from southern Africa and A. jubatus raineyi from eastern Africa) display markedly reduced levels of genetic variability compared to other mammal species (O'Brien 1994) . This would result in intensive inbreeding. When a breeding colony of this species was contaminated by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Oregon state (USA), 100% of the captive animals showed morbidity symptoms and 60% of them died (O'Brien 1994) . In contrast, in domestic cats, the mortality incidence of this virus is very rare (around 1%). According to O'Brien (1994) , the high sensitivity of this cheetah colony to the FIP would be directly linked to the very low (almost monomorphic) level of variation of the Major Histocompatibility (MHC) genes characterising the cheetah.",

MHC genes encode cellsurface glycoproteins, binding antigens derived from pathogens and parasites and constitute the most polymorphic genes in vertebrates (Parham 1999; Charbonnel et al. in this volume) . They present antigens to Tlymphocytes which develop the appropriate immune responses. Two major groups of MHC genes are recognised: the MHC class I genes are specific to the immune defence against intracellular pathogens by binding peptides mainly derived from viral proteins or cancer infected cells. The MHC class II genes present with T-lymphocytes, peptides essentially derived from extra-cellular parasites (bacteria, nematodes, cestodes, etc.). The variability of MHC genes is correlated with the diversity of the T-lymphocyte receptors, which, in turn, determine the resistance of an organism to pathogens and parasites (Parham 1999) .",

However, according to several recent studies, several processes would help to maintain high levels of MHC genes diversity. Indeed, these studies demonstrated that the anti-gen binding sites (ABS) display more non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions compared to what would be observed under neutral theory (in this condition, the rate of synonymous substitution is predicted to be larger than the rate of non-synonymous substitution as the latter change the amino acid composition and would be likely deleterious) (Sommer 2005) . This phenomenon cannot be explained by higher mutation rates in this region (Hughes and Yeager 1998) and the hypothesis accepted at present is that this particular nucleotide diversity in MHC genes would be the result of balancing selection. This would allow the maintenance of large numbers of alleles in populations and also the persistence of allelic diversity over long periods of time. Following this strategy, the binding of a large set of antigens would be possible.",

This hypothesis is based on the fact that hostparasite dynamics is considered as a co-evolutionary race. Pathogens adapt to infect the most common genotype, leaving rare genotypes least infected. If alleles are favoured when they are rare, but selected against when they are common, this will result in a balanced polymorphism (Sommer 2005) Different studies confirmed the effect of balancing selection on the high MHC diversity. One of the best examples concerns the Nicolas Island fox (Urocyon littoralis dickeyi) (Aguilar et al. 2004 ). On the basis of different neutral markers (microsatellites, minisatellites and allozymes), this species is considered as one of the most monomorphic among sexually reproducing species. Regarding the low variability of these markers, this species would have many problems of fitness as well as low resistance to pathogens. However, it is characterised by a surprising high level of MHC diversity which makes it much more resistant to what could be expected. This observation is interpreted as being the result of intense periodic balancing selection at the MHC which may have allowed the persistence of variation within this species despite strong genetic drift.",

Analysis at the ABS showed that non-synonymous substitutions were higher than synonymous ones, suggesting selection leading to an increase of amino acids changes in the ABS region and thus to higher divergences between MHC alleles (Sommer 2003) . These studies indicated that other selection processes are able to maintain some MHC polymorphism (not on the number of alleles but rather on the genetic difference between the existing alleles) even in species surviving bottlenecks. This would be sufficient to prevent immediate pathogen-induced declines. However, such kind of adaptive processes to changing conditions is probably limited and does not predict the outcome effects of introduced pathogens, which differ from commonly encountered diseases. Probably, the maintenance or even renewal of variation in functional important regions of the MHC, either from mutation, recombination or immigration from other populations, would be an important genetic component to allow an appropriate immune response (Sommer 2005) . However, too strong genetic bottlenecks, leading to important inbreeding depressions, do not permit such kind of processes to operate and this explains why some species like the cheetah or the Asian lion are so sensitive nowadays to diseases.",

During the last 20 years, a great amount of zoos worldwide have participated in the management of endangered species., Many threatened species have captive populations that act as insurance against extinction in the wild and, indeed, captive breeding programs have saved some endangered species from extinction (e.g. P\u00e8re David's deer, European bison, etc) (Frankham et al. 2002) . Because parasites may have negative effects on their host, veterinarians in zoos take great care to reduce or even to remove entirely parasite loads on captive animals. As the ultimate goal of breeding programs in zoos is to increase threatened populations or to reintroduce individuals into the wild, parasites play an important role. What could be the consequences of maintaining hosts during many generations in a parasite-free environment? The potential risk is to release into the wild individuals that have lost their defences against pathogens and diseases. Once in the wild, they will be in contact with a vast array of parasite species and may be unable to resist to their detrimental effects. Maintaining some parasites on individual hosts kept in captivity could be a way to solve part of this problem.",

Thus, induction of IL-4 could underlie the alterations seen in host immunity (i.e. high inflammatory activities). Helminths also appear to protect the host from aberrant Th2 diseases such as asthma and food allergy (Weinstock et al. 2004) , and there is now an immunological basis for protection by helminths. Human epidemiological data and several animal studies support the notion that helminths protect the host from immunological disease (Elliott et al. 2005) , particularly those caused by the activation of the Th1 response by microparasites. For example, helminths protect mice and rats from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, as welll as other diseases of immunity. Thus, natural exposure to helminths may guard animals from developing severe immunological diseases, suggesting that helminths should be useful in conserving both endangered and captive species. Gompper and Williams (1998) proposed a series of measures to maintain endangered parasite species originating from threatened hosts in captive breeding program. However, they pointed out that because most of the public disapprove of protecting parasite species, attempts to conserve unique species of parasites could result in a hostile public response against efforts to preserve hosts. Therefore they proposed a series of measures aimed to save parasite species without damaging attempts to conserve hosts. One of those measures was to find alternative hosts to maintain parasite populations for potential reintroduction once the host population was restored. However, the problem of parasite conservation concerns mainly highly host-specific parasites. To find alternative hosts on which specialist parasite populations would be viable may be a difficult task because experiments on cross-species infection have shown a strong decrease on both parasite survival and reproductive success on the foreign host, even if this new host species belongs to the same host genus (Giorgi et al. 2004) .",
