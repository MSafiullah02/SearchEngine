The interplay of ligands binding to their cognate receptors as a means to regulate cell function, induce proliferation or trigger apoptosis has since become fundamental to our understanding of cell biology, immunology and neurobiology, as well as to the rational design of innovative therapeutic drugs, laying the foundations of modern pharmacology. During the past quarter of the 20th century, however, this paradigm of the receptor/ligand \u2018duo\u2019 has had to be revised so to incorporate a third player in this scene, soluble receptors, thus creating a triad of proteins whose balance regulates and fine tunes cellular function. Soluble receptors\u2014molecular decoys, were first proposed as novel biologics, envisioned as receptor mimetics that would function to intercept and sequester a pathogen in solution, before it would have the chance to encounter its cellular target. However, as gene cloning, expression of recombinant proteins and genomics flourished it soon became obvious that artificial decoys were in fact lagging in comparison to what turned out to be nature's basic modus operandi. For almost every membrane receptor of cytokines, growth factors and cell adhesins, soluble versions were found to be naturally produced by cells; hence \u2018natural decoys\u2019 that function as modifiers of the potent stimulants and regulators of inflammation and immune response. Moreover, it was discovered that these same decoy receptors had been hijacked by viruses over the course of their co-evolution with their hosts.",

The neutrotoxins, such as d-tubocurarine and cobra toxin, are antagonists of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, whose binding opens the channel leading to membrane depolarization and ultimate muscle contraction. Ligand overlay of protein blots [15, 16] proved to be effective for delineating a major component of the cholinergic binding site within the extracellular domain of the receptor's alpha subunit. Recombinant fusion proteins expressing the ligand binding segment of the alpha subunit were found to efficiently bind alpha neurotoxins in vitro [17, 18]. The production of the recombinant cholinergic binding site, R4137, was ultimately tested in vivo and found to protect mice against lethal doses of both cobra toxin and d-tubocurarine [19]. With the in vivo proof of principle, the concept of \u2018Decoyance\u2019 was proposed as a general application of receptor derived soluble molecular mimetics\u2014decoys1\n, for the treatment and prevention of infectious disease.",

A case in point is Clostridium difficile Toxin A, a major cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and colitis [7]. The toxin is a large protein (308 kDa) that binds to the trisaccharide sequence Gal\u03b1[1\u20133]Gal\u03b2[1\u20134]GlcNAc displayed on the luminal surface of the apical plasma membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, a sugar-based decoy was produced and tested by the Canadian Biotech company, Synsorb Biotech, who conjugated the trisaccharide onto an inert silicon-based support. This was then introduced orally to rats that were subsequently subjected to Toxin A. The decoy-treated rats did not present the typical Toxin A associated pathology of the ileal mucosa as compared with the controls. Hence the decoy was able to sequester the toxin. This decoy application is particularly attractive in the incidence where antibiotic treatment is in fact detrimental; antibiotics compromise the natural flora providing Clostridium with an opportunity to colonize. Telovamer, a soluble, high molecular weight anionic polymer represents a \u2018functional decoy\u2019 able to bind and neutralize both Toxin A and Toxin B of Clostridium difficile yet is not derived from the natural receptor for these toxins. Genzyme Corp has announced recently that a phase III clinical study proved less effective than earlier phase II results had indicated, yet further development is being pursued.",

Antibiotic therapy in such cases is contraindicated as it leads to the release of cell associated Shiga toxin (Stx) and induces toxin gene expression, thus leading to an increase in free toxin in the gut lumen. An elegant treatment of STEC infections has been proposed by Paton et al. who have constructed a recombinant probiotic E. coli strain that displays Stx receptor mimics on its surface. Stx binds the glycolipid receptor, globtriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) that has the structure Gal\u03b1[1\u20134]Gal\u03b2[1\u20134]Glc ceramide. The glycosyl transferase genes IgtC and IgtE derived from Neisseria were introduced into E coli R1 rendering it able to produce a chimeric lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core terminating in Gal\u03b1[1\u20134]Gal\u03b2[1\u20134]Glc.

The mode of action of SEB is to bind the V\u03b2 region of the T cell receptor (TCR). Despite the relatively low affinity between SEB and V\u03b2 (Kd = 144 \u03bcM), the potency of this toxin is very high (lethal doses can be as low as nanograms per kilogram body weight). Buonpane et al. [22\u2022\u2022] have systematically optimized the murine V\u03b28.2 domain using serial mutagenesis and yeast-display followed by increasingly stringent screens against biotinylated SEB. The highest-affinity mutant isolated had an affinity of 48 pM that is a three million fold improvement over the wild type V\u03b28.2\u2013SEB interaction. This V\u03b2 decoy proved highly effective in neutralizing the toxin, even in rabbits that had already developed early signs of toxic shock syndrome.

Bacillus anthracis secretes a tripartite toxin composed of: Protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa) that binds macrophages; Lethal factor (LF), a zinc metalloproteinase; and a Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase called Edema factor (EF) [23]. PA83 binding to the integrin-like I domain of the macrophage surface protein; capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), leads to its cleavage by furin endoprotease producing PA63. The oligomerization of PA63 into a heptamer provides the binding site for LF and EF that are then endocytosed and eventually kill the cell. Various approaches have been developed to counteract anthrax toxin of which anti-PA antibodies have proven particularly effective. The concern however, is that weaponized strains of B. anthracis may be engineered to produce antigenically altered versions of PA that would escape neutralization by existing anti-PA antibodies. Here the attribute of decoys is apparent as one assumes that the receptor binding surfaces of PA would not be amenable to mutagenesis and epitopic modification. Scobie et al. have been able to demonstrate that soluble CMG2 can function as a potent decoy capable of protecting rats against lethal toxin challenge making this decoy one of the most effective anthrax anti-toxins known [24].",

Antibodies are as efficient in antigen recognition as are their cognate membrane bound BCRs.

Owing to this diversity, there was even question as to whether a single molecule could be responsible for such a variety of functions. The ultimate cloning of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in 1984, laid this debate to rest as it became clear that these cytokines function as a \u2018master switch\u2019 of sorts, responsible for the expression and release of numerous other cytokines (e.g. IL-6 and many chemokines). Availability of recombinant IL1 also promptly led to the discovery of its receptors, first IL-1R type 1 that is a member of the Ig superfamily (contains three Ig-like extracellular domains) and signal tranduces through a Toll-like cytoplasmic domain. This receptor is expressed on most cells and functions in a complex with its \u2018associated protein\u2019\u2014AcP. A second IL1-R (type II), expressed primarily on B cells, monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), also exists yet is unable to signal transduce (its cytoplasmic tail is only 29aa long). Colotta et al. were able to show that IL-1R type II functions as a decoy receptor and is present in both membrane associated and soluble forms [49]. Furthermore, its expression is regulated by IL-4. Together, these illustrate the complexity and elaborate regulatory devices that exist for the control of the IL-1 response. The action of IL-1, mediated by its association to IL-1R type I, can be moderated by sequestration of the cytokine by soluble IL-1R type II, which is itself upregulated by IL-4. Moreover, as IL-1R type II also binds AcP, the effect of binding of decoy IL-1R type II to the complex\u2014IL-1/IL-R type I/AcP causes a dominant negative shut down of signal transduction.",

Thus for example, the vaccinia viral receptor for IL-1 tends to be much more specific for IL-1\u03b2 than its mammalian cell homologue. For the viral IFN\u03b3R, which is highly stringent in the host, the opposite occurs and is broadly cross reactive as a soluble viral decoy. This decoy may actually be the result of capture of not only the receptor domain from the host but also of a helix-turn-helix (HTH) derived from the TFIIA host transcription factor [60]. As in the transcription factor, this HTH domain allows oligomerization and is the structural element that enables the viral decoy to form tetramers and thus benefit from more avid binding. The multi-domain nature of viral decoys is found in the vTNFR as well [61]. The pox TNFRs are coded by four genes named cytokine response modifiers B (CrmB), CrmC, CrmD and CrmE. In CrmB, in addition to its TNF binding domain, its carboxy terminus has developed the capacity to bind chemokines. Thus, CrmB can simultaneously sequester TNF and bind chemokines as well.",

In contrast to two other antagonists based on TNF-specific monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab), etanercept binds both TNF\u03b1 and lymphotoxin (formerly TNF\u03b2) thus illustrating the advantage of a decoy over antibodies that tend to be more restrictive for their binding. Etanercept also shows higher potency for RA therapy although does not seem to be as effective as the antibodies in treatment of Crohn's disease ([65], see also [67\u2022]).

So long as the tumour is not \u2018hooked-up\u2019 to the vasculature, oxygen and nutrients are limited, growth is restricted and the shedding of malignant cells able to \u2018seed\u2019 other organs is not possible. Folkman was the first to propose anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of solid tumours [71, 72\u2022\u2022]. Indeed, a central target for drug development is the regulator of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF [73\u2022]. VEGF exists as a number of molecular variants and related factors such as placental growth factor, and elicits its effect by binding to its receptors VEGFR1 (flt-1), VEGFR2 (flk-1) and VEGFR3. The first biologic to be FDA approved as an anti-VEGF cancer therapeutic is the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin). Since then a highly potent VEGF decoy, \u2018VEGF trap\u2019 (Aflibercept, being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi-Aventis2\n), has been produced [74, 75\u2022]. VEGF-trap is a recombinant immunoadhesin composed of the D2 Ig domain of VEGFR1 linked to the D3 Ig domain of VEGFR2 fused to the Fc of IgG1 thus creating a dimeric decoy. In preclinical mouse models for non-small cell lung cancer [76] and renal cell cancer [77] VEGF-trap has proven to be substantially more potent than bevacizumab. In view of these results VEGF-trap is currently the subject of four Phase III clinical studies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and prostrate cancer [75\u2022].",

The decoy neutralization of toxins appears to be very effective and should provide genuine biologic anti-dotes. The prospects for anti-virals seem more complex as the demand for sterilizing efficiency for the moment is beyond the potency of existing decoys. Markedly increasing the affinity of decoys for their cognate viruses might be necessary to make this class of therapeutic effective.
