            "text": "Enveloped viruses use a variety of cellular membranes to support different processes in their life cycles. Recent studies have shown that enveloped viruses that assemble intracellularly sometimes induce the formation of large complexes through association of organelles. These \u201cfactories\u201d are the framework for viral replication and/or assembly and the intracellular signals involved in their formation are poorly characterized Lee et al 1996, Mckenzie et al 1999, Risco et al 2002, Salanueva et al 2003. One of the less understood features of these factories is how viral components, physically anchored in different (apparently distant) organelles, are efficiently transfered between the organelles. One example would be the transport of replicated genomes from the replication complexes to the virion assembly sites. The superior preservation of small cellular and viral structures after freeze-substitution has been the key factor for identifying viral intermediates and maturation events in the morphogenic pathway of several viruses Risco et al 2002, Salanueva et al 1999, Salanueva et al 2003. Coronaviruses and bunyaviruses assemble in association with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi complex, respectively. For both, a major structural transformation of the virion inside the Golgi complex has been reported in that immature precursor viral particles change their organization inside the Golgi stack to produce mature virions; this maturation process requires a functional trans-Golgi subcompartment Salanueva et al 1999, Salanueva et al 2003.",

Rubella virus is the only member of the Rubivirus genus within the Togaviridae family, a group of single-stranded RNA(+) viruses that also includes the Alphavirus genus, a group of well-known pathogens. However, outside of genomic coding strategy, these genera are quite dissimilar (Frey, 1994). Based on computer-assisted homology analysis, it has been proposed that rubella virus originated by a complicated event including recombination with progenitors of the current alphaviruses, human hepatitis E virus, and possibly plant viruses (Frey and Wolinsky, 1999). Rubella virus is the causative agent of a generally benign disease known as rubella or German measles in children and adults but is highly teratogenic during the first trimester of pregnancy, leading to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella virus has no known natural host other than humans. Despite routine vaccination programs which have been in place for 30 years, the virus persists in the human population and remains an important human pathogen (Frey, 1994).",

            "text": "The study of rubella virus has progressed slowly because of the slow replication rate, low virus yield in infected cell culture, and lack of synchronous infection in cell culture. Infection is known to induce a variety of morphological changes in the host cell, including the modification of lysosomes to produce enlarged structures filled with vesicles known as cytopathic vacuoles (CVs). CVs contain the viral \u201cRNA-replication complexes,\u201d or RC, as defined by the presence of double-stranded RNA Lee et al 1994, Magliano et al 1998. Infection also produces a significant alteration of mitochondrial morphology and distribution (Lee et al., 1999). Similar RC-containing structures were previously identified in cells infected with alphaviruses (Froshauer et al., 1988). Subsequent virion assembly, however, follows very different pathways for these genera. While alphaviruses assemble nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm which then bud through the plasma membrane, rubella virions assemble in the Golgi. The genomic RNA is a single molecule of positive-stranded RNA about 10 kb in length. The rubella virus structural proteins, capsid protein (C) and glycoproteins (E2 and E1), are translated from a 24S subgenomic RNA yielding a 110-kDa polyprotein precursor with the internal order NH2-C-E2-E1-COOH that is co-/posttranslationally processed by lumenal signalase to produce the three mature proteins. Rubella virus nucleocapsid assembly occurs in association with membranes and is synchronized with virus budding (Frey, 1994). Conversely, alphavirus nucleocapsid assembly occurs independently of membranes and virus budding (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). The structure of alpha and rubella virions is also different. As revealed by cryoelectron microscopy studies, alphaviruses are icosahedral enveloped particles with an internal core tightly attached to the envelope, building a double T = 4 icosahedral shell (Mancini et al., 2000). Rubella virus contains a smaller core, clearly separated from the viral envelope (Murphy, 1980). A T = 3 icosahedral symmetry has been proposed for rubella virus capsids (Chantler et al., 2001), although direct structural evidence is lacking. To acquire potential new data on rubella virion assembly in the Golgi complex, we have studied the morphogenesis of rubella virus by freeze-substitution electron microscopy in Vero and BHK-21 cells, the two cell types routinely used to grow rubella virus. One-step multiplication conditions are more closely approached in Vero cells than in BHK-21 cells (Hemphill et al., 1988) and the number of extracellular virions is higher for rubella virus-infected Vero cells, while the number of intracellular virions is higher in infected BHK-21 cells (Bardeletti et al., 1979).",

Characteristic CVs in association with mitochondria and cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Magliano et al., 1998) were observed. While in control, noninfected cells, mitochondria of a medium electron density were randomly distributed (Fig. 1A), infected cells at 16 h.p.i. had elongated mitochondria with increased electron density that clustered around CVs formed in perinuclear regions (Fig. 1B). When low-magnification fields of cells sectioned through an equatorial plane were studied (approximately 100 control and 100 infected cells were analyzed) 73% of mitochondria in infected cells were seen attached to CVs, while only 12% of mitochondria in control cells were detected close to a vesicle or a vacuolar structure. We frequently detected Golgi stacks containing virions in close proximity to these CV\u2013mitochondria\u2013RER complexes; this was a novel observation (Fig. 1C). Higher magnification of CVs (Fig. 1D) revealed small vesicles attached to the internal membrane surface. These vesicles (arrows in Fig. 1D) had a diameter of roughly 30 nm and contained a dense core. The morphology and distribution of CVs were similar to those described by Kujala et al. (1999). By 48 h.p.i., noticeable cell degeneration had occurred. At this time p.i. intact Golgi stacks were difficult to detect and numerous cells contained \u201cempty\u201d mitochondria (Fig. 1E).",

Because of the relative scarcity of virions at early times we had to scan a larger number of sections (around 500\u2013700 infected cells per time point) than in later times. More than 400 control, noninfected Vero and BHK-21 cells were also studied to discard the potential presence of small structures of cellular origin in the locations of rubella replication and assembly (the whole study included observation of close to 5000 cells). At early times budding profiles and virus particles were detected inside Golgi stacks. These particles exhibited a predominant morphology, shown in Figs. 3A to E, with a diameter of 64.3 \u00b1 3.8 nm and a homogeneously dense interior. Some particles were still attached to the budding membrane (Figs. 3C and D), while others showed fine contacts between the internal dense material and the particle membrane (Fig. 3E). Particles representative of a minor population are shown in Fig. 3F. In these, the majority of the interior of the particle was occupied by a dense material, but the center was less dense and had an annular structure, most probably representing an intermediate stage in the process of core formation. The third virion morphology inside the Golgi stack is shown in Fig. 3G and consists of viral particles with an internal core clearly separated from the viral envelope. This was the morphology previously described for rubella virions; in our sections it was the only virion morphology detected in secretory vesicles and the extracellular medium and thus represents the mature particle (Fig. 3H). At late times, coincident with significant deterioration of cell ultrastructure, the relative amount of intra-Golgi immature (uniformly dense) viral particles decreased and mature intra- and extracellular particles were the predominant class. By 48 h, the number of intracellular particles was very small and primarily extracellular virions were detected. All virion assembly detected in infected BHK cells was similar to that described in Vero cells, namely, homogeneously dense particles and particles with defined internal cores were observed inside Golgi stacks and in the perinuclear region (Figs. 3I and J), while extracellular particles were solely of the mature morphology (Fig. 3K).",

In contrast, the capsid protein of alphaviruses is cleaved by a viral endoproteolytic activity and released into the cytoplasm (Froshauer et al., 1988). Since the capsid protein molecules appear to be first associated with membranes, some reorganization inside the viral particle must take place to produce the mature core which resides in the center of the mature particle well separated from the virion envelope. The core\u2013envelope fibrous connections detected in extracellular virions could be related to the early associations between the capsid protein and the membrane.

Rubella virus is then the third virus genus documented to undergo structural change inside the Golgi stacks. Rubella virus assembly would seem to be more similar to that of bunyaviruses than to coronaviruses since rubella immature particles transform rapidly after budding, as suggested by viral particles with assembled cores but still attached to the budding membrane (Fig. 3G). Another similarity in the maturation process of bunyaviruses and rubella virus is the efficiency of the mechanism that blocks the exit of immature viruses. While a significant number of coronavirus immature particles are seen inside secretory vesicles and outside of the cell, no immature viruses are seen on the surface of cells infected with bunyaviruses (Salanueva et al., 2003) or rubella virus (as seen in this work).",

In this analysis we could not confirm the existence of assembled cores on the periphery of CVs, mitochondria, or any location other than within mature virions. An alternative interpretation for the images reported by Lee et al. (1999) is that C protein is actually on the periphery of the CVs but not as assembled cores. It would be then interesting to define the role that C protein is playing there. Interestingly, in a study focused on the identification of host cell proteins involved in rubella virus assembly, Beatch and Hobman (2000) found that rubella virus capsid protein interacts with the host cell protein p32 on the periphery of mitochondria. P32 protein has been shown to bind a variety of other virus phosphoproteins that complex nucleic acids. Its interaction with rubella virus capsid protein could play a role in the regulation of nucleocapsid assembly (Beatch and Hobman, 2000).",

Second, it has been found that expression of structural proteins results in formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) that are similar in all aspects, including morphology, to virions Hobman et al 1994, Qiu et al 1994. While VLPs do not contain genome RNA, it is not unequivocally clear whether they incorporate cellular RNA molecules. Study of VLP expressing cells would be of interest to determine if their morphogenesis is similar to the process observed during normal infection. Together with expression of rubella nonstructural proteins, these studies can help to characterize the factors involved in organelle recruitment and how this is involved in rubella replication and morphogenesis.",

Infected Vero cells were fixed at 12, 16, 24, and 48 h.p.i. while BHK-21 cells were fixed at 24 and 48 h.p.i. since infection progresses more slowly in this cell type and fewer cells are infected. After chemical fixation in a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% tannic acid in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), the cells were processed in parallel by fast freezing followed by freeze-substitution in a mixture of acetone and osmium tetroxide before embedding in an epoxy resin (Risco et al., 2002) or conventional dehydration in acetone at 4\u00b0C followed by embedding in an epoxy resin (Salanueva et al., 1999). Preservation of fine structural details is superior after freeze-substitution Risco et al 2002, Salanueva et al 2003 when compared with conventional processing, which, on the other hand, provides higher contrast of intracellular membranes. Ultrathin sections (30\u201340 nm) were stained following procedures for obtaining high contrast, such as using uranyl acetate in ethanol before treatment with lead citrate, as described (Risco et al., 2002). Sections were studied in a JEOL 1200-EX II electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Electron micrographs were scanned using an Epson Perfection 2450 PHOTO scanner and Picture Publisher 8 as software.",
