Although a number of promising potential vaccines and therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV have been described (reviewed in Golda and Pyrc, 2008), it is unclear if any are likely to become therapeutically useful. In particular, although neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified (Rockx et al., 2008), the diversity of SARS-CoV-like sequences found in the animal reservoirs makes antigen selection for vaccine development difficult prior to a new zoonotic transmission (Deming et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2007).",

            "text": "A number of stages in the SARS-CoV life cycle represent attractive targets for potential anti-SARS-CoV therapeutics. Enzymatic processes such as polymerase and protease activity are often good targets for antivirals due to their specialized mode of action. Trials using small animal models, however, have been less promising with many of these candidates failing to inhibit viral replication in vivo (Barnard et al., 2006). Inhibition of viral entry is appealing as a drug target for many viruses including SARS-CoV as it prevents the initiation of any steps towards viral replication. Indeed, virus entry is now a major focus for drug development, with several inhibitors either on the market or in clinical trials. Multiple steps in the entry process are valid targets for inhibition, including attachment, receptor engagement, viral internalization, envelope conformational rearrangements and membrane fusion. The use of pseudovirions to identify small molecule entry inhibitors of difficult to handle and/or highly pathogenic BSL 3/4 viruses such as Lassa virus has recently been described (Garcia et al., 2009, Larson et al., 2008, York et al., 2008). Indeed, using pseudovirions, complemented with live virus, we have previously demonstrated that inhibitors of cysteine proteases, such as leupeptin, act as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry (Simmons et al., 2005). This inhibition is the result of an absolute requirement in cell lines for endosomal processing of the spike glycoprotein by cathepsin L (CTSL) during entry into the target cell (Simmons et al., 2005, Simmons et al., 2011). In vivo, the situation is more complicated, with a number of secreted or surface proteases presence in the respiratory tract, such as the cellular type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2, able to mediate SARS-CoV entry via non-endosomal routes (Glowacka et al., 2011, Kam et al., 2009).",

In preliminary studies, we found that many initial hits identified as potential inhibitors of entry mediated by enveloped, pH-dependent viruses such as SARS-CoV, were mildly toxic in at least some cell lines. These candidate inhibitors were also often able to inhibit many other enveloped viruses, likely due to subtle effects on cellular function such as endocytosis (data not shown). In order to overcome this obstacle at an early stage, a second unrelated viral envelope was utilized in order to reduce the numbers of false positive hits obtained from the primary screen. Both targeted and general small molecule libraries were screened for inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry, and a number of compounds were identified that inhibit SARS-CoV entry and replication.",

In order to verify that this was not the case entry and inhibition of both pseudoparticle variants were tested separately and in combination (Table 1\n). Assays were carried out with different dual pseudovirus combinations, one encoding a test viral envelope with firefly luciferase reporter [HIV-luc(viral Env)] and the other encoding a control viral envelope with renilla luciferase [HIV-ren(viral Env)] and then compared to the individual virus alone. After 48 h, infection of the pseudovirion particles in terms of relative light units for firefly and Renilla luciferase were analyzed sequentially. These studies determined that some envelopes, such as VSV-G are unsuitable for use in the dual envelope assay. Use with HIV-luc(VSV-G) led to an almost universal increase in infection by HIV-ren viruses (Table 1). Similarly, most HIV-luc viruses were enhanced by HIV-ren(VSV-G). This was possibly due to the highly fusogenic nature of VSV-G. It is notable that a number of other more specific combinations of pseudotyped viruses also appear to be incompatible (Table 1). For example, the combination of HIV-luc(MLV Env) and HIV-ren(SARS-CoV S) yielded only 62.3% and 81.5% infectivity compared to the single virus controls, respectively, although the inverse was, respectively, 82.1% and 105.4%. Moreover, the mix of the same virus with both firefly and Renilla luciferase reporters also showed decreased infection compared to the single virus alone, especially for pseudoviruses with SARS-CoV S, MLV Env or Ebola GP. This is likely due to competition for low levels of receptors between the viruses with the two different reporters.",

Cysteine protease inhibitors, such as leupeptin, are highly effective against SARS-CoV entry in cell lines (Simmons et al., 2005), and ST-193 has recently been identified as an inhibitor of arenavirus entry (Larson et al., 2008). The dose response curves for these two inhibitor classes were super-imposable for mixed or individual pseudovirion infections (Fig. 2\nA and B). Leupeptin exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection for both HIV-luc(SARS-CoV S) and HIV-ren(SARS-CoV S), regardless of whether the partner Lassa GP pseudovirion was present or not. Thus, the presence of an irrelevant envelope does not interfere with inhibition by a specific inhibitor. The dose response curves of SARS-CoV spike with other envelope combinations were also assessed and found to give similar results to SARS-CoV spike and Lassa GP, including envelopes from MLV (Fig. 2C and D) and CHIKV (data not shown). These results indicate that the dual pseudovirion systems with SARS-CoV, Lassa GP, MLV or CHIKV were suitable to be used in HTS against inhibitors of SARS-CoV-mediated entry. These studies also demonstrated that there were no issues with signal quenching in the dual assay, such as carryover of false signal or loss of true signal. Before proceeding to HTS, we analyzed the performance of our assay system without adding any compounds. An example of assay evaluation with the combination of HIV-luc(SARS-CoV S) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP) five 96-well plates indicated that HIV-ren(Lassa GP) the inter-plate coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.10%, while the Z\u2032 was 0.91. Similarly, for HIV-luc(SARS-CoV S), the CV equaled 6.08% with a Z\u2032 of 0.82. Similar results were observed with the 384-well format [CVHIV-ren (Lassa GP)\n = 9.93%; Z\u2032 = 0.78 and CVHIV-luc (SARS-CoV S)\n = 7.55%; Z\u2032 = 0.78].",

This high hit rate is likely representative of the fact that related compounds were clustered in the library, and indeed a number of related \u201chits\u201d were identified. Nine of the 31 candidates had corresponding reductions in Lassa GP pseudovirions greater than m-3SD and an additional two candidates had reductions in Lassa GP controls greater than m-2SD. Because we observed less variation in Lassa GP-based pseudovirions in general, and based on past experience with toxicity we utilized the stricter criterion for deciding whether a compound was pursued for further evaluation. Thus, the inclusion of the control pseudovirus [HIV-ren(Lassa GP)] was found to be useful for avoiding likely nonspecific inhibition by promiscuous inhibitors and reduced the hit rate by over a third (11 out of 31 were called false positive) (Fig. 3B).",

A number of compounds retained the ability to inhibit the viral protease, including WRR 495, which was highly potent against 3Clpro (Goetz et al., 2007). WRR 495 was found to inhibit SARS-CoV entry with a respectable IC50 of approximately 3 nM, again somewhat better than the CTSL-specific inhibitor, Z-Phe-Phe-FMK (Fig. 4C). However, this compound was found to have greatly increased toxicity with little added anti-viral benefit (Goetz et al., 2007). Even though no ideal lead candidates with dual activity have yet been identified it is hoped that further investigation may yield such a compound.",

This system focuses on finding inhibitors of the step of viral entry, and minimizes the risks associated with hazardous viruses, allowing handling at BSL-2, when specialized BSL-3 facilities would otherwise be necessary. The DEP assay also identifies grossly toxic compounds and reduces the number of false positive hits introduced by compounds able to non-specifically inhibit shared cellular functions of many viruses, for example endocytosis. We demonstrate that this system reduces the number of false positive hits significantly, allowing earlier identification of promising inhibitors. Indeed, if envelopes are chosen with care, this assay allows simultaneous screening of two unrelated envelopes of interest that can also act as internal controls for each other.",

            "text": "In earlier screens we found that many promising inhibitors of entry mediated by pH-dependent viruses such as SARS-CoV, were able to inhibit other viruses, likely due to toxic or other more subtle effects on cellular function. These hits were often not cytotoxic in common laboratory cell lines, but showed sufficient signs of toxicity in primary cell types such as hepatocytes not to be considered likely drug candidates (data not shown). Thus, although pan-viral family antivirals are an attractive goal, we have generally avoided such leads as a somewhat unrealistic objective, and the dual envelope assay allows the rapid and early identification and elimination of such compounds. Ironically, notable exceptions to this rule are the protease inhibitors described in this study. These compounds act through a very defined mechanism, blocking envelope processing and/or viral capsid uncoating and can clearly be demonstrated to inhibit filoviruses, coronaviruses, henipaviruses and reoviruses (Chandran et al., 2005, Ebert et al., 2002, Pager et al., 2006, Pager and Dutch, 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). Thus, care must be taken when choosing partner virus envelopes, not to use envelopes with overlapping functions, receptors or specific targets. For example, the use of Ebola GP with SARS-CoV S would have eliminated the detection of the WRR series of compounds, as entry mediated by both viral envelopes is blocked by CTSL inhibitors. Indeed, the assay could be reversed if a common entry mechanism were suspected, in order to deliberately search for specific inhibitors of this mechanism by only selecting hits that reduced both viruses.",

            "text": "Based on this assay system, we successfully initiated screens of two libraries for compounds that would target the viral entry process of SARS-CoV. In particular, inhibitors of the essential step of SARS-CoV spike proteolysis, which, in cell lines at least, occurs in the endosomes of target cells (Huang et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005) were identified. It is hoped that compounds identified in these assays to be specifically able to inhibit the endsomal proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV Spike will be useful in animal studies for determining whether the CTSL/endosomal route of entry or surface protease-mediated fusion route is most important in vivo. Many of these hits were dipeptide epoxyketones, and had previously been reported to inhibit one of the coronavirus proteases (Goetz et al., 2007). Two of these epoxyketones, WRR 182 and WRR 183, are isomers of each other. This affects their biological properties, with WRR 183 being 10-fold more potent against the SARS-CoV chymotrypsin-like protease. Nevertheless, both compounds appear to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro with apparently similar abilities (Goetz et al., 2007). We demonstrate here that WRR 182, but not 183, is highly active against SARS-CoV spike-mediated entry. Thus, the antiviral properties of these two isomers are explained. The R isomer likely acts through the inhibition of CTSL activity. In contrast, the S isomer inhibits replication due to the fact that it binds irreversibly to the 3Clpro protease. Compounds capable of inhibiting both CTSL and 3Clpro would target the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle, thus increasing their efficiency. This would also likely lessen the chances of drug resistance being established. With the WRR 495 compound we demonstrate that this is indeed possible. Unfortunately, this compound, unlike the parental compounds, is highly toxic. It is possible that this is due to WRR 495 becoming broadly active against many cellular proteases, although we have not demonstrated this. Nevertheless, WRR 495 represents the potential that other, less toxic, dually active third generation compounds can be developed.",
