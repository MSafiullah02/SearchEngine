Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell-line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell-based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti-A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti-HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti-HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls.

Systemic vasculitis was also found and characterized by edema, thrombosis, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in many organs including heart, lung, liver, kidney, and the stroma of striated muscles [Ding et al., 2003] .

(2003a) concluded that the clinical progression of SARS had a tri-phasic pattern according to the clinical presentations and pathological changes. Phase I (the first week), characterized by fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms was supposed to be the effect of viral rapid replication and cytolysis. As the disease progressed into phase II and phase III, the rates of viral shedding from nasopharynx, stool, and urine decreased gradually, however, severe clinical worsening often occurred at this time [Peiris et al., 2003a; Poon et al., 2004] . In addition to pulmonary damage, some autopsies also revealed systemic vasculitis [Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003] .

There are many well-established methods to detect antibodies against whole cells. The use of fluorescein-conjugated antisera to human immunoglobulins (indirect immunofluorescence staining) is the standard method with high specificity; however, this method is limited by low sensitivity [Lindquist and Osterland, 1971; Tan and Pearson, 1972; Praprotnik et al., 2001] . Cell-based ELISA is now the method used most widely. In this assay, whole cells from different sources are used as the substrate and fixed by glutaraldehyde treatment. The procedure of cell fixation may lead to false-positive results, probably because autoantibodies reacting to intracellular antigens are also detected as well, therefore, the specificity of this method is limited [Meroni et al., 1995; Praprotnik et al., 2001] .

There is no literature concerning AEpCA detection in those disorders with pulmonary involvement using respiratory tract epithelial cells as target cells. A549 cells, an easily available and commonly used human respiratory epithelial cell-line, were used as the sub-strate in this study. The results showed the development of IgG anti-A549 cell antibodies in SARS patients but not in patients with streptococcal necrotizing pneumonia, and this is the first report of the association between autoantibodies development and infectious pulmonary disorders. In contrast to AEpCA, AECA are extensively studied. AECA have been found in a wide range of diseases, especially in systemic autoimmune diseases and primary autoimmune vasculitis [Carvalho et al., 1999; Toyoda et al., 1999; Praprotnik et al., 2001; Grunebaum et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003] . Vasculopathy or vasculitis may develop after some viral infections including hepatitis C virus (HCV) [Cacoub et al., 1999] , cytomegalovirus (CMV) [Toyoda et al., 1999] , and dengue virus [Lin et al., 2003] . In these conditions, AECA could also be detectable. SARS primarily affects lung, but vasculopathy/ vasculitis of other organs can also be found as the disease progresses [Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003] . This phenomenon indicates that SARS-CoV like HCV, CMV, or dengue virus may have the ability to damage vessels directly or indirectly, and this may be the reason why those IgM anti-HPEC antibodies and IgG anti-HUVEC antibodies could be detected in SARS patients. Another relevant finding in this study revealed that IgA anti-HPEC and IgA anti-HUVEC antibodies, although were not statistically increased at phase I, decreased significantly when the disease progressed to phase II/ phase III. This phenomenon may be explained by the invasion of SARS-CoV that activates mucosa-associated immune system, a specialized system for IgA globulins Fig. 3 .

PBS was used in this test as a control to eliminate non-specific bindings (1st row). production, and induces the formation of IgA AECA that decline gradually when the viral load is decreased.",

            "text": "The mechanisms of these autoantibodies development in SARS patients were speculated: after the contact of SARS-CoV, possibly through the epithelial cell surface receptor recently identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 , the virus invades into the epithelial cells, and that can be directly observed by the electro microscope [Peiris et al., 2003b] . During the first week (phase I), SARS-CoV replicates rapidly and induces cytolysis. At the same time, macrophages accumulate around local inflammatory site; and these activated macrophages and other cells may release tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1, and other proinflammatory cytokines are increased after SARS-CoV infection [Beijing Group of National Research Project for SARS, 2003; Ng et al., 2004] . The damaged cells and the stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines may reveal some cryptic autoantigens. Macrophages infiltrated around the lesion may play another role as the antigen presenting cells, initiate the process of adaptive immunity, and lead to the formation of autoantibodies. However, patients with necrotizing pneumonia characterized by severe pulmonary cells damage and increased proinflammatory cytokines did not have the same phenomenon. Another possibility may be that SARS-CoV shares some specific antigenic determinants with epithelial cells and endothelial cells individually. The antibodies primarily against the virus then crossreact with these cells due to molecular mimicry. Autoantibodies against cells like AECA are functionally heterogeneous, most probably depending on their specificity [Bordron et al., 2001] . They may only be epiphenomenon of pulmonary epithelial and vascular injury, but they could also have pathogenic roles to cause further cellular damage by apoptosis, complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxic pathway [Bordron et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2003; Worda et al., 2003] . In SARS patients, it was found that those autoantibodies binding to epithelial cells and endothelial cells could activate the complement system and induce some of these cells lysis.",

These autoantibodies also seem to have the potential to damage some epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and these reactions provide another immunological clue for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. Because of the possible pathogenic potential of these autoantibodies, it is suggested to exclude the possibility of cross-reactions to these primary cells in the development of SARS vaccine. Fig. 4 . Complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Sera from SARS patients (n \u00bc 9) at phase II/phase III with autoantibodies and from healthy controls (n \u00bc 9) were used against (A) A549 cells, (B) HPEC, and (C) HUVEC. Low-Tox-M rabbit complement (1:20 dilution) was incubated with pre-inactived sera, and the cytotoxic effects were evaluated by the supernatant levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Data were calculated and expressed as cytotoxicity index (%) (*P \u00bc 0.001, **P \u00bc 0.005).",
