After many years of causing significant morbidity, especially in this population, the causative agent was finally identified in 1953 by investigators at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and by military infectious disease researchers [1, 2] .",

Some of these subgroups have been directly linked to different clinical syndromes, but more than half of the serotypes have not yet been identified with a clinical disease process [2] . This is largely because adenovirus infections are responsible for three distinct types of infection of human cells: lytic infection, latent (chronic) infection, and oncogenic transformation of cells [2, 3] . The lytic process is a fairly rapid sequence of events beginning with active infection of epithelial cells, replication of the virus, and subsequent release of viral progeny with resultant cell death. Only about 1% to 5% of the progeny are infectious and therefore able to continue the viral life-cycle. This type of infection is responsible for most of the classic respiratory and enteric clinical illnesses [2, 3] . Latent infection usually occurs in lymphoid tissue and results in a chronic, indolent infection, which is frequently asymptomatic and therefore hard to link to clinical disease. During this process, only a few viral particles are released, and host tissues continue cell replication with minimal to no injury and therefore viral infection is sustained at a very low level in the host [2, 3] . The last type of infection, oncogenic transformation, has been the main focus of adenoviral research, mostly because of its potential use in future gene therapy and other therapeutics. During this infection, the virus invades human cells and integrates into the cellular genome without production of infectious viral progeny. This may lead to a subsequent oncogenic transformation of the cell, without an acute clinical infection [1] [2] [3] .",

During these studies, they found that the oncogenic simian virus 40 (SV40) could transform adenovirus 7 into a virus with oncogenic potential [1, 2] . Furthermore, a variety of studies showed the presence of adenovirus in various human malignancies, although establishing a causal relationship to human cancers has been difficult. Studies by Green, through the NIH, investigated the presence of oncogenic adenovirus in a variety of human tumor cells [1] . These investigations failed to show a link between the virus and development of cancer in humans [1] . However, these studies led to future applications and the development of the live adenovirus vaccine.",

Hakim and Tleyjeh [10\u2022] described a case of severe adenoviral pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult that progressed to ARDS with hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. This report reviewed the literature and identified 14 other cases of severe adenoviral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults, suggesting that this serotype may have more significant clinical implications in healthy adults and adolescents [10\u2022] .",

            "text": "The initial studies by Dingle and Langmuir [1, 17] detailed the classic outbreaks of adenoviral infection that occurred almost exclusively in military recruits in the 1940s and 1950s (known as acute respiratory disease of recruits). They detailed the epidemiology, natural history, and infectivity of the previously unknown causative agentsadenovirus serotypes 4 and 7-which had a tremendous impact on troop strength during basic training in Fort Bragg, NC [1, 17] . These serotypes were found to cause respiratory tract illnesses almost exclusively in military recruits, and only minimal impact in the general population or among pediatric patients [1, 17] . Outbreaks of adenovirus-associated acute respiratory disease had an attack rate of about 80% of new recruits, and a hospitalization rate of 20%-a substantial negative impact on military forces during basic training [1, 17] . The epidemiologic work by Dingle and Langmuir [17] was the impetus for the development of the live-oral attenuated adenovirus vaccine by military infectious disease experts and the NIH in the 1960s [1, 18] . The vaccine was very effective, resulting in a 50% to 60% reduction of respiratory illness in new recruits [1, 18] . This vaccine was in routine use at military training sites by 1971, and targeted serotypes 4 and 7, the two most common serotypes associated with severe disease. However, in the late 1990s, the vaccine was no longer manufactured and administered to military recruits. This circumstance resulted in a resurgence of adenovirus respiratory tract disease with the familiar serotypes 4 and 7, as well as the emergence of two new serotypes, 14 [19\u2022] . Studies performed in the civilian population in the local area showed that among pediatric isolates, the most common serotypes isolated were adenoviruses 1, 2, and 3, rather than the serotypes seen in the basic training facilities [21] . However, in Oregon, serotype 14 was found in 60% of adenovirus isolates; many of these patients were older with underlying chronic diseases and immunosuppression, which ultimately resulted in hospitalization [22\u2022\u2022] . The overall impression from these outbreaks suggests that certain clinical presentations and populations with adenoviral respiratory infections should alert physicians to the potential of more severe illness and the need for closer monitoring and preventive measures.",

These infections are from either the reactivation of latent virus or the recent acquisition of a new serotype. Clinically, they can range from asymptomatic viral shedding to severe pneumonia or ARDS. Other clinical manifestations described in these patients include fulminant hepatitis, gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and encephalitis [5, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Studies have reported that the overall incidence of acute adenovirus infection in stem-cell transplant patients ranged from 6% to 30% [5, 14, 23] . In addition, clinical presentations ranged from hemorrhagic cystitis to severe pneumonia or upper respiratory infections [5, 22\u2022\u2022] . Overall, the risk factors associated with severe infection were younger age, presence of graft-versus-host disease, receipt of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and receipt of preparatory total body irradiation prior to transplant [5, 23, 24] . The morbidity and mortality associated with this infection in immunocompromised individuals has led to the use of cidofovir treatment regimens and other supportive measures for patients with acute adenoviral infection [2, 5, 23, 24] .",

The clinical presentation in adults is described as acute onset of pain, photophobia, increased lacrimation, and conjunctival injection. Some patients have also described the sensation of a foreign body within the involved eye [2, [27] [28] [29] . Infants and neonates tend to present with conjunctival injection, increased lacrimation, and periorbital edema. The lack of ability to detect pain or photophobia in this patient population has been associated with delays in diagnosis, contributing to nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units [27] [28] [29] . The most common serotypes associated with EKC are 8, 19, and 37 [27] [28] [29] . More recently, adenovirus 22/H8, a new hybrid adenovirus, has also been associated with EKC among patients who were examined with contaminated ophthalmologic equipment [30] .",

Testing for the presence of the virus in respiratory secretions, serum, urine, stool, and conjunctival scrapings can be performed via culture, real-time PCR, or antigen detection [2, 32, 33\u2022] . However, all of these tests have limitations. The virus has the ability to persist as a latent subclinical or chronic infection, which does not necessarily prove its role as the causative agent when it is detected [32, 33\u2022] . In addition, acute and convalescent serum antibody titers can be measured, and show a fourfold rise following acute illness. Culture of adenovirus usually takes 5 to 7 days, although recovery is a challenge because only 50% to 70% of samples yield positive results [2] . However, real-time PCR has a much higher sensitivity and provides results within 1 to 2 days [2, 32, 33\u2022] . The rapidity of real-time PCR is extremely helpful in the clinical setting, especially in outbreaks and epidemics. Recently, Metzgar et al. [34] described the increased utility of real-time PCR, especially in detection of pathogenic serotype 14. Their study showed that PCR had a higher sensitivity and specificity for serotype 14, with no known cross-reactivity with other respiratory viral pathogens [34] .",

Not all patients who were hospitalized received cidofovir; however, of the six who did, four survived their infection [22\u2022\u2022] . The major limitation of cidofovir therapy is the high risk of nephrotoxicity, which limits its use and duration of therapy, especially in high-risk or immunocompromised patients [36] . Some protocols use large fluid boluses to help prevent these consequences; however, there are limitations to their use, and they are not entirely successful in preventing this complication. More recently, a study assessing the efficacy of cidofovir with and without intravenous immunoglobulin showed some benefit in the group that received combination therapy with immunoglobulin and cidofovir in stemcell and solid organ transplant patients [37] . Overall, the nephrotoxicity and lack of definitive clinical trials to show efficacy with cidofovir therapy in adenovirus infection has deterred its routine use in patients.",

These findings prompted further investigations by NIH and military infectious disease experts, resulting in the discovery that adenovirus serotype 4 and 7 gastrointestinal infection produced lasting serologic immunity and protection without resulting in clinical respiratory infection. This discovery led to the development of the bivalent oral live-attenuated adenovirus vaccine [1, 39, 40] . As mentioned earlier, the vaccine had a tremendous impact on reducing infection and morbidity and mortality associated with adenovirus acute respiratory disease in military recruits [18] . However, since discontinuing production of the vaccine, serotypes 4, 7, 14, and 21 have increased significantly [39, 41] . This occurrence led to the recent development of a new adenovirus oral live-attenuated vaccine by the military. The first published reports from the phase 1 trial of the new oral adenovirus serotype 4 and 7 vaccines in military recruits showed that the vaccine produced a good immune response with minimal side effects as compared with placebo [42\u2022 ]. Viral shedding continued for 1 to 3 weeks after vaccine administration; however, the development of immunity to both serotypes was noted by 28 days [42\u2022] . Phase 2 and 3 trials were recently completed with this vaccine, and are awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration for its routine use in military recruits.",

This vaccine resulted in a significant decrease in epidemics and outbreaks, especially among military recruits [1, 18, 40] .
