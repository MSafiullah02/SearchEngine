            "text": "Biologists are devoted to exploring the complexity of evolutionary interactions among divergent viruses and their underlying reservoirs, and apply latent theoretical tenets to resolve practical cases. Viruses from the genus Lyssavirus, usually called lyssaviruses, belonging to Rhabdoviridae of the Mononegavirales order, present a classical case to study the emergence and cross-species transmission of infectious disease [1]. Rabies is an acute and almost invariably fatal encephalomyelitis in humans, usually caused by rabies virus (RABV) infection, which is a single-stranded, negative-sense, non-segmented RNA virus of approximately 12 kilo bases. The genome mainly encodes five proteins: The nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the large protein (L) [2,3]. RABV can infect a variety of mammalian hosts, especially bats and certain carnivores. It is distributed worldwide and has a high mortality, and remains a permanent threat to public health [4,5,6]; nevertheless, it is still neglected. Lyssaviruses are mainly classified into 16 species and, currently, two more tentative species. RABV, Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) are seven species that have been already identified. Other species have been recently identified, including Aravan virus (ARAV), Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV), Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV), Irkut virus (IRKV), Khujand virus (KHUV), Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV), Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV) and Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus (GBLV) [7,8,9,10]. Putative species, including Taiwan bat lyssavirus (TBLV) and Kotalahti bat lyssavirus (KBLV), have not yet been classified [11,12]. Historically, each species of lyssavirus is associated with a specific geographical area and is detected in different hosts and vectors [13]. For instance, EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 are found in serotine bats and Daubenton\u2019s bats, respectively, in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Norway, while ABLV is found in pteropid and insectivorous bats in Australia. In addition, RABV is distributed worldwide in dogs and several carnivores, except in Antarctica and a few islands, though it is commonly found in China and India [14,15,16]. However, the evolutionary relationship among these different viruses, caused by geographical isolation, is still not clear.",

The preferential usage of codons is referred to as codon usage bias and is a widespread phenomenon in nature [18,19]. Mutation pressure and natural selection are the two main forces influencing codon usage patterns. Other factors include dinucleotide abundance, tRNA abundance, GC content, gene function, gene length, RNA structure, replication, and external environment, among others [20,21,22,23]. In terms of virus infection, the codon usage pattern of the respective host might affect virus survival, adaptation, evolution, and control of the host immune system, given that the virus relies on host cell machinery [24]. Thus, the study of codon usage patterns can provide more detailed information regarding virus evolution and a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis, which can aid the development of drug targets for more effective vaccines and reinforce control measures to prevent the spread of this severe zoonosis.",

The highest ENC value corresponded to the P gene of RABV (57.87 \u00b1 1.93). For DUVV and ABLV, the highest ENC values also corresponded to the P gene.

In RABV, among the 18 most used synonymous codons, 10 were G-and C-ended (6 G-ended; 4 C-ended) and the other 8 were A- and U-ended (6 U-ended; 2 A-ended), so the preferentially used codons were G- and U-ended codons. However, for other lyssaviruses the preferred codons were A- and U-ended (LBV: 6 A-ended and 8 U-ended; MOKV: 7 A-ended and 5 U-ended; DUVV: 5 A-ended and 5 U-ended; ABLV: 4 A-ended and 7 U-ended). Interestingly, the preferred codons of EBLV were equally ended in A- and U- or G- and C-ended (2 A-ended, 7 U-ended, 3 C-ended and 6 G-ended). Next, we found that 2 of the 18 preferred codons in RABV (UCU for Ser and AGA for Arg) had RSCU values >1.6, and the remaining preferred codons had RSCU values >0.6 and <1.6. The number of over-represented codons of ABLV, EBLV and DUVV were same to RABV, MOKV and LBV had 3 preferred codons with RSCU values >1.6 (Table 1). None of the preferred codons were under-represented (RSCU < 0.6), regardless of the virus strain. Overall, the patterns of synonymous codons of RABV and other lyssaviruses are similar, though there are some differences in terms of preferred codons at the third position of synonymous codons.",

The plot first (f\u20191) axes against second (f\u20192) axes showed that lyssaviruses are divided into six groups, although there was a degree of overlap, indicating that these lyssaviruses strains may have the same ancestor. PCA also revealed that whole genome coding sequences of lyssaviruses strains were frequently distributed along the first (f\u20191) and second (f\u20192) principal axes except for LBV, while the individual coding sequences of lyssaviruses strains were diffusely distributed (Figure 2).",

We found that the ENC values of all lyssaviruses strains occur below the expected ENC curve and clustered together except for LBV in ENC-GC3s plots (Figure 3A), indicating that, except for mutation pressure, other factors, including natural selection, also drive the codon usage bias of RABV and other lyssaviruses strains. However, in the plot constructed using individual gene coding sequences, some points fell on the expected curve, for instance the N, P and M genes of RABV, the M gene of LBV and MOKV (Figure 3B\u2013F). Interestingly, most of the LBV rarely clustered together with other lyssaviruses, regardless of the coding sequences of genome or individual genes (Figure 3), which is consistent with the plots of nucleotide distribution. To further analyze the impact of the highly biased genes restriction on codon choice, the relationships between the AU contents and the GC contents in the fourfold degenerate codon families (alanine, arginine, glycine, leucine, proline, serine, threonine and valine) were analyzed by PR2 plots (Figure 4). We found that the distribution of nucleotides was unequal in whole genome or individual gene coding sequences. Additionally, we discovered that in the four-codon amino acids family A \u2260 U, G \u2260 C, indicating that the driving forces are not sole and the extent of the influence is also not equal. We hypothesized that this may be due to a combination of mutation pressure and natural selection. Then we calculated the correlation of multiple factors. Several indices significantly correlated with the principal axes (Table 2 and Table S3), further confirming the above conclusion. Overall, natural selection and mutation pressure both have contributed to the codon usage bias of lyssaviruses strains.",

The slope of RABV was 0.030 indicating that natural selection is the primary force influencing the codon usage patterns of RABV. The slopes of LBV, DUVV, EBLV-1, ABLV and MOKV were 0.075, 0.120, \u22120.080, \u22120.020 and 0.077 respectively.
