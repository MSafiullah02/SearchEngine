            "text": "In April 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in Mexico and spread rapidly worldwide [1]. By June 11, 2009 nearly 30, 000 cases had been confirmed across 74 countries including Malaysia, prompting World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to phase 6 [2]. After the first reported H1N1 case in Malaysia in May 15, 2009, the numbers increased exponentially and as of May 31, 2010 they totaled 14, 821 with 87 deaths [3]. Thereafter, there have been numerous reports describing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of H1N1 infections. However, studies focusing on the effects of respiratory pathogen coinfection on clinical and laboratory parameters in the H1N1 infected patients are scarce. Clinicians may assume that a single virus type is involved, as laboratory detection involves PCR specifically targeting H1N1. However, bacterial coinfection had been shown to contribute to morbidity and mortality in previous influenza pandemics [4]. Therefore, this study aims to explore the clinical and laboratory characteristics amongst patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and the effects of bacterial coinfection on these parameters.",

The presence of bacterial coinfection from respiratory specimens (sputum, tracheal/nasopharyngeal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) or sterile site samples (blood or pleural fluid) taken within 48 hours of admission was recorded. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed by serology using particle agglutination test (Serodia- Myco II, Fujirebio Inc., Japan). A single titer of \u2265 160 was considered as diagnostic cut-off titer, based on population background study conducted in Malaysia [6,7]. All samples confirmed H1N1 positive were stored at -80\u00b0C for further analysis using multiplex PCR (Seeplex RV Detection, USA) which detects adenovirus, influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3 and human metapneumovirus. Hematological, liver and renal function parameters on admission were recorded.",

CDC recognizes the importance of early empirical antibiotics in H1N1 infected patients who might have concurrent bacterial pneumonia [13]. Our study showed that leukocytosis and neutrophilia were notably higher in bacterial coinfected patients. This finding could alert physicians about the possibility of bacterial coinfection, as clinical diagnosis may be insufficient and bacterial cultures take time. Eighty-two percent of our patients received empiric or definitive antibiotics at some point during admission which was comparable to high rates in a China study [9].",

As such, our study was inadequately powered to examine the influence of certain characteristics. Nasopharyngeal aspirates may have questionable pathogenic role, however the 3 patients with positive NPA were treated with appropriate antibiotics as they were felt to be clinically relevant. Mycoplasma serology was not performed in all patients and the request was based upon physicians' discretion, this may have underestimated the actual number of cases. The preadmission antibiotic therapy could underestimate the bacterial coinfection rates. Despite these limitations, we identified bacteria coinfection in 28% of our patients.",

Bacterial coinfection was more frequently seen in the older age group and was associated with higher rates of complications. As adjunct to clinical findings, clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion if neutrophilia was identified on admission as it may denote bacterial coinfection. A larger scale study will be useful to further confirm our findings.",
