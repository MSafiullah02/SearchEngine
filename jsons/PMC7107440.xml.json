Traps were placed 100 m apart in areas with evidence of recent civet activity (fresh scats, tracks, or foraging sites), and left in place for at least 2 months before being moved to new locations. Traps were positioned under cover (e.g., leaves, branches, or bamboo) to provide shade for captured animals, and the trap floor was covered with soil and leaf litter to maintain continuity with the surrounding substrate (Jennings et al. 2006). Wild fruit and dead chickens were used as bait and placed at the back of the trap. Traps were left open continuously and checked each morning and afternoon.",

Most civets became immobile within 5 min of injection and remained so for at least 30 min. During immobilization, we measured head-body and tail lengths, determined sex from external genitalia, and evaluated reproductive status from teat condition in females and testes descent in males (Jennings et al. 2010). Study animals were classified in 1 of 4 age classes: juvenile (relatively small body size and deciduous teeth still present; < 1 year), young adult (almost full size but not sexually mature; 1\u20132 years), adult (full size and showing signs of sexual maturity; > 2 years), and old adult (full size with advanced tooth wear\u2014Jennings et al. 2010). Study animals were placed back into the trap and allowed to recover fully for 3\u20134 h before being released at the site of capture. To increase sample sizes for investigations of sexual dimorphism in body size (Jennings et al. 2006), we also took morphometric measurements on adult civets road-killed between May 2007 and March 2008.",

Locations were established when 3 or more bearings intersected at 1 location. The reliability of telemetry locations was confirmed by civet sightings and tracks, whenever possible. Masked palm civets undergo significant seasonal changes in body mass, and juveniles grow rapidly (Zhang et al. 1991; Kang et al. 1997). We therefore fitted radiocollars as loosely as possible to avoid constriction injuries (Koehler et al. 2001).",

            "text": "\nHome-range estimation.\u2014To avoid autocorrelation, we used only independent point locations in home-range estimates (Swihart and Slade 1985), based on the time required for fixes to be independent. We estimated time to independence as the time after which the location of the animal between consecutive fixes is no longer dependent upon its location in the previous fix. For some study animals, independence may never have been attained if their movements occurred at relatively small spatial scales. For these individuals, the time interval with the least dependence was used (Colon 2002). We calculated home-range sizes using 100%, 95%, 75%, and 50% minimum convex polygon (MCP) methods (MCP100, MCP95, MCP75, and MCP50, respectively). This approach facilitated comparisons to other studies that have reported data on civet home ranges (Rabinowitz 1991; Joshi et al. 1995; Grassman et al. 1998; Wang 1999; Colon 2002; Jennings et al. 2006, 2010; Nakashima et al. 2013). Comparison of MCPIOO and MCP95 home ranges enabled us to identify outliers that resulted from occasional long-distance forays (Colon 2002; Jennings et al. 2010), whereas MCP75 and MCP50 were used to delineate core use areas (Zhang et al. 2010; Powell 2012) for comparisons with other studies (Rabinowitz 1991; Wang 1999; Jennings et al. 2006, 2010). Carnivores typically exhibit site fidelity and live in discrete areas (where they know the locations of resources, escape routes, and potential mates) for long periods (Palomares 1994; Phillips et al. 1998; Costello 2010), enabling the calculation of contemporaneous home-range overlap (Powell 2000, 2012; Fieberg and Kochanny 2005). Following Fieberg and Kochanny (2005), home-range overlap was defined as:\n\nwhere HRij represents the proportion of animal i's home range that is overlapped by animal j's home range, Ai represents the area of animal f s home range, and Aij represents the area of overlap between the 2 animals' home ranges.",

Similar patterns have been found for common palm civets in Nepal (Joshi et al. 1995) and Malay civets in Borneo (Macdonald and Wise 1979; Colon 2002), but not for Malay civets in Sulawesi and Peninsular Malaysia (Jennings et al. 2006, 2010). Joshi et al. (1995) found that home-range overlap in common palm civets was minimal when food was abundant and uniformly distributed, and increased when food patches were more clumped in distribution; they concluded that the lack of territoriality indicated that food resources were either too abundant to warrant defense or too sparse to be efficiently defended. Colon (2002) also speculated that spatial and temporal variation in the abundance and distribution of food resources in rain forests might account for the overlapping home ranges of Malay civets in Borneo, whereas Jennings et al. (2006, 2010) posited that spatiotemporal variations in diet and food availability may account for the different spatial organization they observed in Peninsular Malaysia and Sulawesi. These findings align closely with the resource dispersion hypothesis (see Macdonald 1983; Carr and Macdonald 1986; Johnson et al. 2002), where exclusive home ranges in carnivores are expected only when food resources are stable and evenly distributed (Macdonald 1983; Sandell 1989). We thus speculate that observed home-range overlaps in masked palm civets may be related to shifting seasonal dynamics in the availability and distribution of food resources in our high-elevation subtropical study area (Zhou et al. 2008, 2011).",

Although we observed masked palm civets climbing trees, these routes represent only their linear movement patterns, mapped in 2 dimensions. Few other studies on wild civets presented detailed analysis of 24-h movements, and most previous studies present only data on straight-line distances between consecutive daily locations. For example, Wang (1999) reported mean Euclidean distances between consecutive day-bed sites for 4 individuals in a similar subtropical habitat, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 km; and Rabinowitz (1991) and Grassman et al. (1998) reported distances of 0.6 and 0.9 km for a male and female, respectively, in tropical forests. Our study produced similar values when we calculated movement distances that way (0.6 \u00b10.1 km, range = 0\u20132.7 km). Other civets (except for the large Indian civet [Viverra zibetha], which had greater straight-line distances: range = 0.8-3.7 km [Rabinowitz 1991]) also had daily relocation distances within this range (Malay civet: range = 0.3-0.4 km [Jennings et al. 2006]; and common palm civet: range = 0.2\u20131.0 km [Rabinowitz 1991; Grassman et al. 1998]).",

Female masked palm civets used a smaller total area and a smaller proportion of their total home ranges than did males, which may be linked to time periods when females have dependent young. The only female with young that we monitored (F07; Table 2) exhibited particularly limited and highly localized movements in the vicinity of the den. Masked palm civets are polyestrous and promiscuous (Jia et al. 2002); thus, the greater daily movement distances and extents exhibited by males may increase their chances of reproducing with more females (Schmidt et al. 2003) or then-foraging efficiency (Manfredi et al. 2011), and may contribute to home-range defense (Sandell 1989).",

Masked palm civets also may be vulnerable to larger predators and adjust their activity patterns to avoid them (Palomares and Caro 1999). Joshi et al. (1995) observed that common palm civets were susceptible to predation in Nepal. Larger predators are no longer present in our study area (tigers [Panthera tigris] and leopards [Panthera par dus] were present historically); consequently, the \u201cghosts of predators past\u201d (sensu Connell 1980) also could contribute to their nocturnality (see also Burnham et al. 2012).",

However, masked palm civets still maintained 39\u201347% of their typical daily (1200 h to 1200 h) activity rates from December through February (Fig. 4), which probably reflects the greater energetic costs of foraging in cold temperatures (Zhou et al. 2008, 2013b).",
