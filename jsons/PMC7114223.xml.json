            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus. The genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 11.4 kb, capped at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes for four non-structural proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp4) which are required for RNA replication. The subgenomic (26S) messenger RNA, equivalent to the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome, encodes for three structural proteins (capsid, E1 and E2) and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K) (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). On infection, the non-structural proteins are translated directly from the genomic RNA, which also acts as a template for the synthesis of the negative-sense strand. The negative-sense strand then provides the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic RNA (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). The release of progeny virus occurs approximately 6\u20138 h after entry of the host cell.",

Viruses in serogroup I are capable of infecting large mammals, for example the IA/B and IC strains are associated with epizootic spread in equines. Infected equines can act as amplification hosts and replicating virus may be transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, possibly resulting in large outbreaks of febrile illness and neurological disease (Weaver et al., 2004). Viruses in other serogroups do not appear to be equine-virulent and persist in a stable enzootic cycle. Natural transmission of enzootic viruses to humans is rare but may be associated with severe disease (Johnson and Martin, 1974).",

An attenuated, live vaccine (TC-83), derived by repeated passage of a virulent IA/B strain in foetal guinea pig heart cells (Berge et al., 1961), is available for the immunization of equines but it is not currently licensed for use in humans. TC-83 is poorly immunogenic in humans (Pittman et al., 1996) and can cause serious side-effects (Alevizatos et al., 1967, Casamassima et al., 1987, Rayfield et al., 1976). Additionally, there are no effective antiviral drugs presently available for use against VEEV. Work is ongoing to develop new VEEV vaccines suitable for human use (Greenway et al., 1998, Hodgson et al., 1999, Kinney et al., 1988, Phillpotts et al., 2005, Pratt et al., 2003) but in their absence the availability of effective antiviral therapies is extremely desirable.",

            "text": "Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small, double-stranded RNA molecules that direct the degradation of complementary messenger RNAs via a cellular process known as RNA interference. siRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex, known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and the antisense strand of the siRNA guides RISC to the target RNA which is then cleaved. RNA interference is an evolutionary conserved mechanism within eukaryotes and its functions include endogenous gene regulation, viral defence and the maintenance of genomic stability (Fountaine et al., 2005). It has yet to be proven that mammals use RNA interference as a viral defence mechanism but in the laboratory, the introduction of siRNAs into mammalian cells can be used to inhibit the expression of viral genes. RNA interference has been shown to be active against many human pathogenic viruses (Geisbert et al., 2006, Reuter et al., 2006, Tan and Yin, 2004), including the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (Caplen et al., 2002) and O\u2019nyong-nyong virus (Keene et al., 2004). The efficient and sequence-specific nature of RNA interference has raised the possibility of using siRNAs as an antiviral therapy. Here, the ability of a pool of four siRNAs to specifically inhibit the replication of six human pathogenic strains of VEEV is described.",

Although significant (P\n \u2264 0.05) viral inhibition was observed at 24 h post-infection (96% decrease in titer), this inhibition was not sustained over a 48 h period (Fig. 6\n). As RNA viruses have high mutation rates, it was possible that VEEV had mutated to overcome the effects of RNA interference. To test this, three samples of virus incubated in the presence of the siRNA pool for 48 h were re-exposed to the VEEV siRNA pool (Fig. 7\n). Re-exposed virus was still sensitive to the effects of the VEEV siRNA pool over a 24 h period (91%, 92% and 92% decrease in titer, P\n \u2264 0.05) and the level of inhibition was indistinguishable from that observed with stock VEEV.

Additional siRNAs could be designed against strain BeAn8 (and Mena II) for inclusion in the siRNA pool. All the individual siRNAs found within the pool inhibit the replication of VEEV strain TrD, although siRNA 3 was on average the least effective. Huesken et al. (2005) have recently described preferences for nucleotides at certain positions in the anti-sense strand of active siRNAs. siRNAs 1 and 2 have four of the preferred bases (at positions 7, 10, 17 and 19 and positions 2, 10, 17 and 19, respectively) and siRNA 4 has three of the preferred nucleotides (at positions 1, 2 and 19). However, in siRNA3, only one of the base preferences is present (at position 17), perhaps explaining it's lack of effectiveness compared to the other siRNAs. Combining the four siRNAs did not cause a large increase in antiviral activity against strain TrD and this is in accordance with the results of others (Schubert et al., 2005, Yuan et al., 2005). It can be envisaged that using multiple siRNAs may lead to a saturation of RISC, thereby reducing the incorporation of individual siRNAs into the complex and decreasing their activity. However, this does not appear to have taken place with the VEEV siRNA pool.",

            "text": "It is possible for double stranded RNA to stimulate innate antiviral defence mechanisms which lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons and the non-specific inhibition of gene expression. Receptors involved in RNA recognition include members of the transmembrane Toll-like receptor family (TLR) and cytosolic RNA-binding proteins such as PKR and the helicases RIG-1 and Mda5 (for a review, see Schlee et al., 2006). However, the evidence to date indicates that short synthetic siRNA duplexes can only be detected by TLR7 (located in the endosomal membrane of immune cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and recognition requires the presence of specific motifs (Hornung et al., 2005, Judge et al., 2005). As the BHK cells used in these experiments are of fibroblast origin and have defects in IFN production (Fournier et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2006) and none of the siRNAs contain the immunostimulatory motifs described by Hornung et al. (2005) and Judge et al. (2005), it seems unlikely that non-specific inhibition of gene expression was taking place. In addition, the replication of SFV was not affected in cells transfected with the VEEV siRNA pool confirming that the siRNAs were specifically inhibiting VEEV replication.",

            "text": "Long-term silencing of viral protein expression by siRNAs has been reported to result in the emergence of viruses resistant to RNA interference (Das et al., 2004, Gitlin et al., 2005), an issue that will need to be addressed if siRNAs are to be used therapeutically. Resistance was caused by the generation of mutations in the siRNA target site. This problem is particularly relevant for RNA viruses that exhibit increased genetic variation due to error-prone replication. To ensure siRNAs remained effective, viral RNA sequences that are conserved, and normally invariant between different strains, have been targeted (Chang et al., 2005, Dave and Pomerantz, 2004) or several viral sequences have been simultaneously targeted (Chang et al., 2005, Geisbert et al., 2006, Gitlin et al., 2005). The work described here utilizes both these approaches and it was successful against VEEV strain BeAn8 but resistance to RNA interference was observed with strain TrD. The mechanism of siRNA resistance in strain TrD is uncertain. Mutations did not occur in the siRNA target sites, indicating that escape mutants do not readily arise when these particular conserved areas of sequence are targeted. Silent mutations, which alter the nucleotide sequence but do not affect the encoded amino acid, have the potential to prevent recognition of the target RNA by the siRNA but even these did not occur. A number of mammalian viruses have been shown to express proteins that function as suppressors of RNA interference (for reviews see Kok and Jin, 2006, Zheng et al., 2005). These viral proteins bind double stranded RNA and are able to protect messenger RNA from degradation by sequestering siRNAs and preventing the formation of an active RISC. The capsid protein of VEEV contains regions that bind specifically to RNA (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). Mutations may have occurred in this protein that led to an increased ability to sequester siRNA and therefore an increased resistance to RNA interference. It has been reported that an additional mechanism for suppressing RNA interference is the production of RNAs that subvert host cell functions, including the inhibition of the RNA interference pathway (for a review see Sarnow et al., 2006). However, this type of RNA has so far only been found in viruses with DNA genomes making this an unlikely explanation for siRNA resistance in VEEV.",

            "text": "To date, RNA interference has been shown to be effective in mouse models of hepatitis B virus (Giladi et al., 2003, Klein et al., 2003, McCaffrey et al., 2003), herpes simplex virus (Palliser et al., 2006), influenza virus (Ge et al., 2004, Tompkins et al., 2004), parainfluenza virus (Bitko et al., 2005) and Respiratory Syncytial virus (Bitko et al., 2005), against Ebola virus in a guinea pig model (Geisbert et al., 2006) and against SARS coronavirus in a Rhesus macaque model (Li et al., 2005). The high level of viral inhibition induced by the VEEV siRNA pool suggests that the siRNAs may be active in vivo and this is currently being examined. Although the level of inhibition induced by the siRNA pool was substantial, the transient nature of the inhibition suggests that a single administration of siRNAs could not be used to cure VEEV infection. Using multiple doses of siRNAs should be avoided as it risks inducing viral resistance. However, the temporary inhibition of viral replication may allow the infected host enough time to develop an immune response capable of overcoming VEEV. Alternatively, siRNAs could be used therapeutically in combination with other antiviral compounds to successfully treat the infection. With a disease such as VEEV, it may be necessary to deliver siRNAs to the brains of infected individuals. Direct injection of siRNAs into the brain has been effectively used to target a wide range of genes (Fountaine et al., 2005) but ideally siRNAs would be administered systemically and then be able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. It has been shown that intravenous injections of pegylated immunoliposomes connected to targeting monoclonal antibodies are able to deliver siRNAs across the blood-brain barrier to successfully treat intracranial brain cancer (Zhang et al., 2004). Alternatively, it may be possible to link siRNAs to appropriate lipid molecules for delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier. This approach was shown to be effective at delivering cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs to the liver and jejunum (Soutschek et al., 2004).",
