Similarly, the novel corrector ABBV/GLPG\u20102222 exhibited increased potency in correcting F508del\u2010CFTR relative to existing CFTR correctors (Singh et al., 192). Novel approaches to improve transport of F508del\u2010CFTR also showed promise, with a high\u2010throughput screening strategy used to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Disabled\u20102 (Dab2) endocytic adapter that modulate internalization of CFTR (Madden et al., 2). These inhibitors can enhance activity of the F508del mutant in conjunction with correctors and potentiators. While promising, many of these new drugs are just entering human trials, so their ability to provide safe and effective improvement in CFTR activity remains unproven.",

While initial clinical studies with readthrough agents based on aminoglycosides were disappointing (possibly due to interactions with inhaled tobramycin3), a high\u2010throughput screening strategy recently identified the herbal extract escin as having substantial readthrough activity (Sharma et al., 198).4 However, previous studies have suggested that escin and other readthrough agents may require combination therapy with CFTR modulators to achieve clinically relevant functionality.5 Indeed, several investigators demonstrated that combinations of readthrough agents with other CFTR modulators including correctors, potentiators, and nonsense mediated decay inhibitors can improve CFTR activity in PTC mutants (Mutyam et al., 189; Bihler et al., 190).",

The most common method for gene therapy has been use of viral vectors, and a study in the CF pig demonstrated the feasibility of using lentivirus or a hybrid piggyback/AAV vector to restore CFTR activity (Vallecillo\u2010Viejo et al., 194). More recently, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has emerged as an exciting new approach toward targeted gene repair, and this methodology was shown to correct a deep intronic splicing mutant in human tracheal epithelial cells (Sanz et al., 195). While promising, this approach will likely need to be paired with stem cell technologies to deliver cells with repaired CFTR to the lung (Ghaedi, S12.4), which remains an emerging technology.3, 6 An alternative approach is to utilize targeted RNA editing to correct mutations after translation, which was shown to restore functional CFTR activity in a PTC mutation (Vallecillo\u2010Viejo et al., 194), though utility is somewhat limited by potential off target effects.",

There remains an urgent need for improved therapies to address the airway mucus abnormalities, infection, and inflammation that characterize CF. One promising novel approach lies in use of the sphingosine\u20101\u2010phosphate lyase inhibitor LX2931, which was shown to reduce airway inflammation in a F508del\u2010CFTR mutant mouse model (Veltman et al., 201). Similarly, hypothiocyanite was shown to inactivate bacterial thioredoxin reductase and enhance bacterial killing (Day et al., 76). Mucus has also been shown to be an important therapeutic target, with many animal models demonstrating the presence of dehydrated mucus with abnormal viscoelastic properties (Rowe and Birket, S01.2), with even very young children with CF having elevated concentrations of rheologically abnormal mucus (Esther et al., 81).",

One emerging model is the use of specialized culture techniques to grow epithelial cells obtained from patient biopsies into spheroid \u201corganoids\u201d that can swell or shrink in response to CFTR modulators (Berkers et al., S12.3). Assays based on organoids obtained from airway cells were shown to predict responses of rare CFTR mutations to modulators better than total protein or chloride current measures (Cholon et al., 11), and the viscoelastic properties of mucus from these organoids correlates with the efficacy of CFTR modulators (Mellnick et al., 149). In addition, intestinal organoids were shown to be useful in developing patient specific, high\u2010throughput screening platforms for novel therapies (Vonk et al., 200).",

One potentially exciting new approach is using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate CFTR deficient rabbits, which appear to exhibit many of the airway and liver phenotypes of clinical disease but are less expensive to maintain than the CF pig or other larger animal models (Xu et al., S12.2). CRISPR/Cas9 was also shown to be useful in quickly creating mouse models with specific CFTR mutations (Valerio et al., 150; Hodges et al., S12.1), which may find value in testing efficacy of novel CFTR modulators even though CF mice do not develop significant airways disease. Existing models including CF ferrets and pigs continue to provide important insights, with the CF ferret shown to develop bronchiectasis even in the absence of bacterial infection (Rosen et al., 151) and studies with the CF pig suggesting that airway acidification via ATP12A may be a novel therapeutic target (Shah et al, S13.3).",

The study struggled with a high number of withdrawals, particularly following commercial availability, with 82% of participants completing week 72 but only 42% completing week 96. Safety findings were similar to that seen in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT with respiratory symptoms most common and elevations in liver transaminases >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) in approximately 8% of patients, with no emergence of new adverse events over 96\u2010120 weeks (including the initial study periods) of treatment.

Emphasis was placed on the consensus document as a starting point that can serve as a means for observational multi\u2010site studies rather than a definite treatise. The epidemiology of NTM was highlighted, for example, the lower prevalence of M. avium complex in younger patients in Europe compared to the US, and the seemingly lower virulence of those infections in Europe (Nick, S04.3). Identification of subspecies of mycobacteria is relevant for prognosis. For example, M. abscessus subspecies massiliense contains a partial deletion of the erm41 gene, which reduces the risk of developing macrolide resistance compared to the M. abscessus ss. abscessus which more often carries the erm41 gene. On the other hand, M. massilliense has been implicated in transmission between CF centers.15 A Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics (CFFT) funded biobank for NTM isolates is ongoing in Denver, Colorado to test for any shared clonal lineages within the US (Hasan et al., 307). Information about transplant in the setting of NTM was presented, specifically the \u201cdearth of evidence\u201d around transplant eligibility of individuals with CF infected with NTM, specifically M. abscessus (Noone, S04.4). Post\u2010transplant mortality due to mycobacterial infection varies in different publications; yet, surgical site and skin infections due to M. abscessus are frequent. Current consensus guidelines recommend evaluation and, if indicated, therapy for NTM prior to referral for transplant. Further, the complexity of long\u2010term multidrug therapy in the setting of immunosuppression and the risk of post\u2010operative complications needs to be considered.",

Many patients and caregivers lack familiarity with palliative care (Prieur et al., 740). Unmet needs in such areas as symptom management and communication about prognosis, and opportunities to engage patients in advance care planning (ACP) were identified (Hobler et al., 675). Patients with CF ages 13 and older and their caregivers are receptive to palliative care education; education appears not only to increase knowledge but also to reduce fears and uncertainty related to the topic (Hailey et al., 757). While a study of advance care planning (ACP) among US CF centers actually suggests more attention to this issue in recent years than in the past, we know that practices vary from center to center.18 Basile reported low frequency of conversations about intensive care options like intubation, and noted variability in people's desires to hear prognostic estimates (Basile et al., 741).
