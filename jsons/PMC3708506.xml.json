            "text": "The most ancient clades of non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (non-LTRs) within the CRE, NeSL, R2, Hero, and R4 clades possess a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a multifunctional protein comprising reverse transcriptase (RT) and restriction enzyme-like endonuclease (REL-endo) domains. One clade (Dualen/RandI) possesses an additional apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA endonuclease (APE) domain, thought to represent an intermediate stage leading to the evolution of a more advanced and diverse series of APE-type non-LTRs, in which the REL-endo domain was lost (reviewed in Malik et al. 1999; Kapitonov et al. 2009; Novikova and Blinov 2009). The 5\u2032-region of the APE-type non-LTRs is, however, plastic in that many of these elements possess two ORFs (ORF1 and ORF2), whereas others lack an ORF1 (e.g., L1Tc, Ingi, and BfCR1; Albalat et al. 2003; Heras et al. 2006). Although coexpression of ORFs 1 and 2 in cis is essential for retrotransposition (Moran et al. 1996), bioinformatic analyses on different clades reveal a range of different ORF1 proteins suggesting that each type was acquired by independent evolutionary events. For simplicity, we will refer to the long ORF (encoding APE and RT domains) as \u201cORF2\u201d throughout the text later, even though in some cases no ORF1 is present.",

The mechanism by which the second ORF is translated from the single polycistronic mRNA is, however, not clear (Alisch et al. 2006). In the case of the SART1 element, it has been shown that ORFs 1 and 2 are linked by an overlapping stop\u2013start codon (-UAAUG-). The efficiency of the initiation of translation of ORF2 was shown to be dependent upon an RNA secondary structure downstream of this site: increasing the distance between the ORF1 stop codon/ORF2 start codon decreased the efficiency of the initiation of translation of ORF2 (Kojima et al. 2005). This strategy of termination\u2013reinitiation is also used by a variety of RNA viruses: influenza viruses (Horvath et al. 1990; Powell et al. 2008), respiratory syncytial viruses (Ahmadian et al. 2000; Gould and Easton 2005), pneumoviruses (Gould and Easton 2007), and caliciviruses (Meyers 2003, 2007; Luttermann and Meyers 2007).",

Briefly, when a ribosome encounters 2A within an ORF, it \u201cskips\u201d the synthesis of a specific glycyl-prolyl peptide bond. The nascent protein is released from the ribosome by eukaryotic translation release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1/eRF3), thereby forming the C-terminus of 2A. Subsequently, ribosomes may then either terminate translation or resume translation of the downstream sequences as a discrete translation product. In this manner, multiple translation products are derived from a single ORF.",

Using this motif to probe databases revealed the presence of 2A-like sequences in a range of other mammalian, insect and crustacean RNA viruses. This motif alone does not, however, comprise an active 2A. The nature of the sequence immediately upstream of this motif, although not conserved among different 2A-like sequences, is critical for recoding activity (Ryan and Drew 1994; Sharma et al. 2012). Indeed, at that time, we detected a number of such motifs within cellular genes but only in the case of L1Tc and Ingi were the 2A-like sequences active in mediating translational recoding. As the range of cellular genome sequences has expanded, our recent bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of 2A-like sequences within APE-type non-LTRs within the genomes of multicellular organisms: vertebrates, cephalochordates, molluscs, echinoderms, and cnidarians.",

One would expect, therefore, that not all 2A-like sequences identified by probing databases would be active in promoting translational recoding. To test for this activity, 2A-like sequences representative of the different non-LTR lineages were inserted into an artificial polyprotein system. This comprised a single, long, ORF encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP: stop codon removed), the 2A-like sequence to be tested, the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS: initiation codon removed), such that the single, long ORF was maintained. An inactive 2A would result in the single translation (fusion protein) product [GFP-2A-GUS]. An active 2A would produce the additional \u201ccleavage\u201d products of GFP with a C-terminal extension of 2A ([GFP-2A]), plus GUS. Not all 2A-like sequences are equally active: in our model of 2A-mediated translational recoding, the interaction of the nascent 2A with the ribosome exit tunnel determines the degree of accessibility of the peptidyl-tRNA ester linkage (in the P-site of the ribosome peptidyl-transferase centre) for the nucleophile\u2014proly-tRNA (in the A site), hence the proportion of translational product in which the peptide bond is formed. Figure 2A shows those 2A-like sequences present in non-LTRs identified, arranged by clade. 2A-like sequences representative of each clade were inserted into the artificial polyprotein reporter system and the \u201ccleavage\u201d activity analyzed. Such activity analyses performed using translation systems in vitro have been shown to be reliable indicators of their activities within a range of (eukaryotic) cellular systems (Donnelly et al. 1997; Donnelly, Hughes, et al. 2001; Donnelly, Luke, et al. 2001; de Felipe et al. 2003; Doronina, de Felipe, et al. 2008; Doronina, Wu, et al. 2008; Luke et al. 2008).",

Although the Branchiostoma CR1-1_BF 2A-like sequence showed low recoding activity, the others showed extremely low (CR1-31_BF) activity, or no activity\u2014essentially too low for us to detect using this system (CR1-2_BF, CR1-10_BF, and CR1-53_BF; fig. 2B). Although the canonical motif was largely conserved in these sequences, we have shown that this motif must have an appropriate tract immediately upstream to mediate ribosome skipping (Ryan and Drew 1994; Ryan et al. 1999; Donnelly, Luke, et al. 2001; Brown and Ryan 2010; Sharma et al. 2012). In the case of the echinoderm CR1 elements, both STR-1_SP and STR-28_SP are N-terminally truncated forms and both showed very low levels of activity. The 2A-like sequence of STR-1_SP conforms to the motif, whereas STR-28_SP has a single substitution at a residue (D \u2192 Q: fig. 2A), whose identity was shown to be an important determinant of recoding activity (Donnelly, Hughes, et al. 2001). This same substitution is observed, however, within the active STR-32_SP 2A-like sequence: The truncation or substitutions (compared with STR-32_SP) within the tract immediately upstream of the motif in STR-1_SP and STR-28_SP renders these 2A-like sequences largely inactive. In both of the mollusc CR1 elements (CR1-1_CGi and CR1-1_LG), the 2A-like sequences were active. In the case of CR1-1_LG, an additional translation product was generated from internal initiation of translation, a common feature of translation reactions in vitro.",

During the course of our bioinformatic analyses, we noticed that the majority of non-LTRs encoding a 2A recoding element did not possess an ORF1, exceptions including CR1-26_BF, CR1-53_BF, and CR1-1_LG. As noted earlier, non-LTRs may undergo truncation of their 5\u2032-ends during retrotransposition, such that ORF1 could be deleted entirely, although the high proportion of non-LTRs encoding a 2A-like sequence but lacking an ORF1 argues against this being purely an artifact. Sequences of non-LTRs encoding a 2A-like sequence (lacking ORF1) cluster alongside elements from other species, which encode an ORF1\u2014but not a 2A-like sequence. All elements within the Ingi clade (Ingi, Tcoingi, Tvingi, and L1Tc) do not appear to encode an ORF1 but possess 2A-like sequences (fig. 2A). It has been reported that Vingi non-LTRs only encode a single, long (993 aa), ORF (Kojima et al. 2011), but many of these elements appear to have undergone N-terminal truncation, and we were unable to detect any 2A-like sequences.",

The majority of elements (\u223c57.5%) encoded the canonical 2A motif -DIEQNPGP-, whereas 20% of elements encoded a single N \u2192 H substitution within the motif (-DIEQHPGP-). Previously, this mutation (within FMDV 2A) had been created and shown to reduce \u201ccleavage\u201d activity (Donnelly, Hughes, et al. 2001). A similar effect was observed for the L1Tc 2A-like sequences (Heras et al. 2006). For non-LTRs encoding 2A-like sequences in the Rex1, L2, Crack, and CR1 clades, frequent substitutions are observed at the glutamate residue (-GD(V/I)ExNPGP-: fig. 2A), previously identified by site-directed mutagenesis as an important determinant of \u201ccleavage\u201d activity (Donnelly, Hughes, et al. 2001). The CR1 clade has high heterogeneity at this residue and it may be that either 1) only very low levels of recoding activity is required from these particular 2A-like sequences or 2) previously (more) active 2A-like sequences have been rendered essentially inactive by the accumulation of mutations in such a key residue.",

Virus particles (or virus-like particles [VLPs]) can, however, encapsidate host-cell, rather than virus, RNAs. The RNA content of highly purified preparations of purified flock house virus (FHV), a nonenveloped RNA virus, and VLPs of FHV and the related Nudaurelia capensis omega virus were studied. In the case of VLPs, 5.3% of the packaged RNAs were found to be transposable elements derived from the host-cell genome. Authentic FHV virions also packaged a variety of host RNAs, including significant quantities of transposable elements (Routh et al. 2012). Naturally, packaging of these host non-LTRs into virus particles (which could deliver these genetic elements into the cytoplasm of cells of other species) constitutes a possible mechanism of horizontal sequence transfer. Neoplastic cells release an abundance of microvesicles, which have been shown to contain RNAs, including notably high levels of retrotransposon RNA transcripts (Balaj et al. 2011). Such microvesicles could provide another mechanism for horizontal sequence transfer via predation/ingestion and fusion of prey-derived microvesicles with cells of the predator delivering the nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. Indeed, \u201csimple\u201d host\u2013parasite interactions are thought to play a role in horizontal transfer of transposons across phyla (Gilbert et al. 2010). Such events would need to occur either by transfer/integration into the genome of a totipotent somatic cell or into the genome of germ-line cells by either direct or indirect transfer (initial transfer into a somatic cell plus subsequent transfer to a germ-line cell by virus particles/microvesicles).",

Such domains are synthesized as discrete translation products even though they are encoded by the same ORF. Some virus 2A sequences have evolved to produce a mixture of \u201ccleaved\u201d and uncleaved (fusion protein) translation products (Luke et al. 2008). Other virus 2A sequences appear to have been used, such that the genome has acquired new functions by essentially \u201cbolting-on\u201d an extra domain to an existing protein (extending the ORF), using 2A as a \u201clinker\u201d sequence. This is most clearly seen in the comparison of type A, B, and C rotaviruses, where type C viruses (but not type A or B) have an RNA binding domain linked to C-terminus of protein NS3 via a 2A linker (Luke et al. 2008). A similar extension is seen at the N-terminus of the long polyprotein encoded by the double-stranded RNA virus penaeid shrimp infectious myonecrosis virus (Luke et al. 2008). Why and from where such additional domains have arisen is not known, but there is evidence to support the case that 2A can be used to mediate the transposition of function between genetic elements. Indeed, 2A-like sequences are very widely used in animal/plant biotechnologies and biomedical applications for linking multiple functions into (mono-cistronic) \u201cself-processing\u201d polyproteins (http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/ryanlab/page10.htm, last accessed June 13, 2013).",

We have proposed that the 2A recoding element is able to downregulate the level of the translation product downstream of 2A compared with that upstream (Brown and Ryan 2010)\u2014a translational regulatory element. With regards the retrotransposition of non-LTRs encoding active 2A-like sequences, two aspects arise from this activity. First, for optimal retrotransposition activity, an excess of the function encoded by sequences upstream of 2A is required over the functions encoded downstream of 2A (RT/APendonuclease). Cells employ a range of mechanisms to inhibit retrotransposition: Although it is thought certain evolutionary advantages may accrue from this activity, presumably too high a level of retrotransposition is disadvantageous. Because selection for, and maintenance of, non-LTRs depends entirely upon the \u201chost\u201d cell, it may be to the advantage of such elements to evolve mechanisms of \u201cself-restraint\u201d with regards the level of retrotransposition within the cell. It was proposed that the L1Tc 2A-like sequence may produce a downregulation of the non-LTR translational products downstream of 2A (APE and RT domains). This could help explain the observation that even though relatively high levels of L1Tc mRNAs are detected within cells, only low levels of ORF2p protein are detected (Heras et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Another important aspect of 2A-mediated \u201cribosome skipping\u201d is that this activity produces discrete, but different, translation products from a single ORF. The ORF2 of APE-type non-LTRs is a multifunctional protein, yet the large majority of these elements encode other functions within a separate ORF1 and not fused to the ORF2 multifunctional protein. Here, one may draw an analogy with RNA replication and polyprotein processing in positive-stranded RNA viruses. During the replication of such virus genomes, some proteins have an obligate function in cis (acting upon the very same RNA molecule on which they are encoded), but may also function in trans. Other virus proteins (notably capsid proteins) function in trans and are generated (or separated from replication proteins) by a variety of methods in different virus groups: 1) a rapid, cotranslational, \u201ccleavage\u201d of the polyprotein (e.g., picornaviruses), 2) by being encoded in a separate ORF within the single-stranded genomic RNA (e.g., dicistroviruses), 3) by being encoded in a separate ORF(s) on subgenomic RNA transcripts produced from a genome-length RNA template (e.g., coronaviruses), or 4) by being encoded by a separate genomic RNA strand altogether (e.g., comoviruses). Drawing upon this analogy with the replication strategy of positive-stranded RNA viruses, one could argue that non-LTR ORF2 functions have an obligate function in cis (reverse transcription/integration into the genome) but can also function in trans (e.g., SINE transposition by LINE-encoded functions). For ORF1 functions, however, the non-LTR genome organization (ORF1 + ORF2) suggests that ORF1 (functions) need to be generated as a translation product quite separate from the ORF2 multifunctional protein. Implicit in this argument is that encoding a 2A-like translational recoding sequence may have allowed APE-type non-LTR genome reorganization from ORF1 + ORF2 to a single ORF: Functions N-terminal of 2A may be generated in the form of a discrete translation product quite separate from the canonical ORF2 functions.",

In trypanosome genomes, the 2A-like sequences within L1Tc show a range of mutations, each with different \u201ccleavage\u201d activity (Heras et al. 2006). Similarly, in this article, we describe 2A-like sequences with a range of activities/no activity within the same species (e.g., S. purpuratus and B. floridae). The simplest explanation of these data is that during evolution, non-LTRs with active 2A-like sequences were acquired, but have subsequently undergone accumulation of mutations leading to a reduction/loss of activity. An alternative explanation is that during evolution, a common progenitor form of these 2A-like sequences (recoding inactive) has undergone a series of independent mutations to produce the range of activities we report here.",

As it stands, however, the distribution of 2A-like sequences we observed in non-LTRs is consistent with the model of deuterosome evolution proposed by Delsuc et al. (2006), in which a lineage comprising echinoderms and cephalochordates diverged from a lineage comprising tunicates and vertebrates. Analyses of complete genome sequences of the sea urchin (Sodergren et al. 2006), sea anemone (Putnam et al. 2007), and amphioxus (Putnam et al. 2008) led, however, to an evolutionary scheme in which the cephalochordates represent the most basal members of the chordate lineage, with tunicates forming a parallel \u201csister\u201d lineage (Putnam et al. 2008). In this scheme, amphioxus (encoding mainly inactive 2A-like sequences) represents the most \u201cbasal\u201d extent of an organism with a genome comprising non-LTRs encoding 2A-like sequences within the chordate lineage. In this case, the pattern of distribution of non-LTRs encoding 2A-like sequences within individual clades does, however, argue either for acquisition of 2A-like sequences within a very early ancestral form of non-LTR accompanied by a subsequent complex pattern of sequence loss.",
