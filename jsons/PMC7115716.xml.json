Various treatment options exist for preventing or treating acute bleeding episodes, including fresh-frozen plasma/cryoprecipitate, platelets and plasma-derived/recombinant clotting factor concentrates [2], [3]. The use of blood-derived and recombinant haemostatic products has increased markedly over recent years, as exemplified by the global use of factor VIII products (Fig. 1\n) [4]. This increased use has been driven by improved availability of clotting factors, increased life expectancy of people with bleeding disorders [5], [6], increased use of prophylaxis for severe bleeding disorders [7], [8] and decreased risk of transmission of infectious agents.",

This risk has reduced dramatically since the implementation of stricter donation screening/donor selection procedures and improved purification procedures, but cannot be fully eradicated. Furthermore, the implementation of pathogen inactivation technology for blood/plasma-derived products has further reduced the risk of transmission of both known and emerging pathogens, although results can be variable according to the methods used [9], [10]. However, it is important to note that patient risk is highly dependent on the circumstances under which blood products are collected, handled and used. In general, clinicians assess the level of risk associated with the use of blood/plasma-derived products by evaluating factors such as patient characteristics (e.g. age, immune status, geographical location, lifestyle) and the nature of the pathogen (e.g. physical characteristics, level of virulence, chronicity of infection, prevalence). The presence of a particular pathogen within blood/plasma-derived products may pose a significant threat to specific patient groups (e.g. the elderly or immunocompromised), while being of low risk to the general population (e.g. HEV).",

            "text": "The majority of diagnostic laboratories focus on the detection of HBsAg, which is the first detectable serological marker of infection. However, there is a risk that the HBsAg concentration may decline to undetectable levels during the course of infection, yielding a false negative result [23]. Screening for antibodies to HBc is the most conservative approach for identifying potentially exposed donors, as this identifies all individuals who have ever immunologically experienced any type of HBV infection (either current, chronic or resolved) and who may experience viral reactivation during their lifetime (particularly under conditions of immunosuppression). However, assays to measure HBc antibodies are relatively non-specific and do not always correlate with the presence of HBV virus in plasma [18]. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility that donors who test positive for anti-HBc do not have pulsed recurrences of virus replication, resulting in the presence of low levels of HBV-DNA in plasma. For these reasons, national transfusion services do not always routinely screen donations for anti-HBc. NAT assays can be carried out, but their use is restricted by potentially low levels of viral DNA [16], [18]. The combined use of HBsAg screening tests and NAT assays has reduced the window period for detection of HBV infection from approximately 60 to 35.5 days [20], [24]. Mutant HBV strains (escape variants) should also be considered, as they may occasionally escape serological detection (although most can be detected by NAT assays) [24], [25]. These HBV-variants are rare, but therefore more likely to enter and contaminate the blood supply as they are more difficult to detect [25]. In summary, the screening of blood supplies for the presence of HBV is effective, but an optimal screening system has not yet been defined.",

Since T. pallidum is heat-sensitive and cannot readily withstand extended storage at low temperatures, storage at 4 \u00b0C for more than three days is sufficient to render the pathogen non-infectious. However, blood components (e.g. platelets) that are stored at temperatures of around 20 \u00b0C do present a risk of T. pallidum persistence.

An immediate screening policy was put in place in the USA in order to reduce the risk of further transmission. This policy included deferral of any individual displaying symptoms of infection, quarantine of plasma collected during periods of high mosquito activity (when WNV is most prevalent) and the rapid development/use of WNV-specific NAT and serological assays. These measures were highly effective and caused a significant reduction in the number of confirmed cases of WNV transfusion-related transmission. However, WNV outbreaks still occur within the Americas, indicating a potential need for seasonal blood screening for WNV [31]. WNV outbreaks have also occurred in Europe (including Italy and Greece), prompting the implementation of seasonal blood screening procedures in the affected regions of those countries [32].",

B19 is prevalent worldwide, with seroprevalence in blood donors varying from between 0.2\u20131.3% in the USA, Europe and Africa and 25\u201340% in Asia [37]. The risk of parvovirus transmission is higher when units of blood are pooled (e.g. to create batches of clotting factor concentrates, albumin etc.) and so individuals with bleeding disorders are at a higher risk of infection. B19 DNA was detected in 26% of clotting factor concentrates in a recent German study [38], and another study found that populations receiving blood-derived products were 1.7 times more likely to display antibodies to B19 than populations who had not received blood products [39]. B19 lacks a lipid envelope, which renders it highly resistant to some methods of pathogen inactivation [40]. Screening of blood donations for B19 DNA is not currently routine, but many manufacturers only process plasma that has been screened for the absence of B19 DNA in order to reduce the risk of transmission [41]. Given the prevalence of B19 in different populations, it is difficult to define the residual TTI risk of this virus. However, it is clear that a transmission risk does exist.",

The main disadvantage of this approach is that UV treatment has been linked to the formation of neoantigens, which may be generated via modification of the surface antigens of platelets. The presence of neoantigens may provoke a recipient immune response during transfusion of UV-treated platelets, causing them to be rapidly cleared from the circulation [81]. While this approach to pathogen inactivation is currently used for platelets and is effective, it needs further refinement for the inactivation of whole blood [81], [82].",

The use of recombinant products, which have been manufactured and formulated with minimal addition of human/animal-derived materials, greatly reduces the risk of recipient exposure to plasma-derived infectious agents and after they have undergone virus removal/inactivation processes, recombinant products can be considered to be as safe as currently possible [83]. Despite these benefits, the use of recombinant products may be limited by higher costs and perceived problems of inhibitor formation [83]. For indications where no recombinant factor concentrates are available, the use of inactivated plasma-derived concentrates is safer than fresh frozen plasma and will reduce the risk of other adverse effects such as hypervolemia, transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI) and hypersensitivity [84].",

Regulatory needs in different European countries are usually based on recommendations from the medical community, so in order to achieve minimal risk, it would be ideal for these regulations to be standardised and mandatory in all countries. Directives issued by the European Union Commission describe the regulatory requirements for the safety of whole blood and plasma, stating that \u201call precautionary measures during their collection, processing, distribution and use need to be taken making appropriate use of scientific progress in the detection and inactivation and elimination of transfusion transmissible pathogenic agents\u201d [85]. However, the relative safety of different screening tests, products and processing methods is not discussed and so individual countries may adopt different approaches towards minimising risk. Although recombinant products are associated with the highest level of pathogen safety, higher costs for development and production may make them too expensive for some healthcare systems [86]. Inhibitor formation also remains an important element of concern with both plasma-derived and recombinant products, particularly with regard to FVIII in haemophilia A [87]. The risk of inhibitor formation was shown to be greater with recombinant versus plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates in some cohort studies [88], but similar in others [89].",

The incidence of HBV, HCV and HIV TTI has fallen to near or below 1 per million transfused units in the industrialised world, indicating that current donor selection and blood screening strategies have had a positive impact on blood safety [14]. However, it is clear that screening both donors and donated blood cannot exclude all known pathogens or eliminate all risks from emerging pathogens [63], [90]. Historical precedent indicates that the blood supply is always vulnerable to contamination by hitherto non-prevalent/unknown pathogens, and that this risk cannot be accurately gauged [91]. As we identify new infectious agents of concern and develop new tests for their detection, it will also be necessary to clearly define the infectious dose range for each agent and use appropriately sensitive tests for their identification. For example, in suspected cases of vCJD infection, considerable challenges remain in the development of screening and confirmatory tests that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be of use in both a clinical setting and within blood banks [92].",
