In COVID-19 positive burned patients, if they are severely burned and is an emergency to admit and treat, they have been admitted in COVID-19 positive ICU , and if they are not that severe, ambulatory regimen with wound dressing is performed until RT-PCR negativization and admission into a COVID-19 negative area to perform the required surgery.(2)",

The chronic and subacute one (4 patients), who had positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, but during more than 3 weeks of follow-up, did not present any symptom or complication related with the coronavirus. They evolved as asymptomatic patients. In the second group (acute burns), with a time relapse in between the burn accident and the positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 of 9 days the manifestation of the disease was different. They were connected to invasive mechanical ventilation because of smoke inhalation injury and the burn SIRS and after that they evolved with COVID-19 pneumonia (Chest CT findings), but there were no signs of acute distress respiratory syndrome. Actually, during 3 weeks of follow-up the ventilation parameters never got worse and non prone position was needed for this reason. Also we have been able to perform our surgical protocol of early debridement and transient or definitive coverage as usual. When we did skin grafting we didn't have any surgical complication during the surgery or in the postoperative time, with no complications in graft taking or donor sites. (table 2) From this small cohort of severely burned COVID-19 patients, today we had one discharge and 5 remains in ICU; 3 patients with tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation and 2 patients with successful weaning. We can not make any conclusion with this data, but in our early experience, we could suggest that the surgical treatment in severely burned patients doesn't need to wait until negative RT-PCR. We think that the delay in the debridement and definite skin graft could be worse for the prognosis of the patient, taking into account the behavior of COVID-19 in this cohort , because of the extremely intense systemic inflammatory syndrome associated to the severely burned and the hight risk of cutaneous secondary sepsis, that could jeopardise any opportunity of a successful outcome in super-infections, a common situation in this setting, and now, COVID-19, is another one in the list.
