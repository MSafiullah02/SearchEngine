His body temperature was 38,5 \u00b0C, blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were normal with adventitious sounds on both sides. His chest CT scan showed multiple, multilobar, peripheral ground-glass opasifications in both lungs ( Figure 1 ). Laboratory tests results showed highly elevated CRP and ferritin levels with marked lymphop enia. His nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV-2. After admission, he received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg for the first day, 200 mg/day for four days), azitromicin 500 mg/day, and osetalmivir 150 mg/day combined with nasal oxygen therapy. His oxygen saturation was declined to 88% on the second day and noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support was started at intensive care unit (ICU). On the fifth day of ICU, he suddenly developed acute confusional state with agitation and his blood pressure observed to be at high levels for a few hours. Meanwhile, the patient complained about vision loss in both eyes. In his neurological examination he was awake, but apathic and hardly obeying commands. His pupils were 2 mm and equally reactive to light. Fundus examination was normal. His visual acuity was severely impared on both eyes; he could only recognize waving hands and there was perception of light. His entire neurological examination was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral, especially left occipital, frontal cortical white matter and splenium of corpus callosum T2/Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities and diffusion restriction in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (Figure 2 ) revealing vasogenic edema similar to posterior reversible leucoencephalopathy (PRES). Hydroxychloroquine treatment was stopped and the dexamethasone with a 24mg/day dose is started. On second dose of corticosteroid treatment, patient was able to obey commands and his visual impairment fully recovered. In his neurocognitive assessment we determined visual agnosia which lasted in a week. The corticosteroid therapy tapered and stopped in two weeks' time. His neurological examination and neurocognitive assessment were completely normal on the tenth day. The brain MRI performed two weeks later, showed complete regression of the lesions (Figure 3 ).",

Common suggestions for pathological mechanisms are direct virus infection invasion or inflamatory factors. Recent autopsy reports have revealed that, like many viral infections SARS-CoV-2 can cause brain tissue edema and partial neuronal degeneration [3] . Infectious toxic encephalopathy is a reversible brain dysfunction syndrome caused by systemic toxemia, metabolic disorders and hypoxia during the process of acute infection [4] . In this disease, main pathological change is brain edema without evidence of inflammation on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Hypoxia in the brain causes anaerobic metabolism in the mitochondria of neurons and this leads cerebral vasodilatation, swelling of neurons, interstitial edema and obstruction of cerebral blood flow [5] .",

That hypothesis is supported by the observation that PRES is usually associated with a systemic inflammatory process such as sepsis, eclampsia, transplantation, and autoimmune disease [7] . Although we could not determine the exact ethiology in our case, regulating the blood pressure controlling the vasogenic edema by corticosteroid treatment and controlling the virus related pneumonia have helped fort he recovery of our patient. Unfortunately, evidences are lacking to determine which of these features were due to infectious toxic encephalopathy, and which features were specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection. ",
