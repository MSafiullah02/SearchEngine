The coronavirus infection favors the appearance of thrombotic events of varying severity in different territories and has the capacity to produce coagulopathies and even disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [1,2]. The possibility of coagulopathies makes it advisable to consider antithrombotic strategies such as the use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) at specific prophylactic or treatment doses depending on the individual case and the added risk factors. It is therefore important to accurately identify risk factors and prescribe the appropriate form of antithrombotic therapy to improve prognosis and reduce the morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19 [3,4].",

If hormonal contraception is required, it is recommended that treatment with CHC is continued or, alternatively, POC can be used if there is another risk factor. POCs can be used along with LMWHs at prophylactic doses (Expert Opinion).bIn women who have had pneumonia but continue to show persistent respiratory symptoms that require only outpatient monitoring and self-isolation, the following actions are recommended: iDiscontinue CHCs and use prophylactic doses of LMWH (Grade C).iiIf hormonal contraception cannot be discontinued, it is advisable to switch to POC and add LMWH at a prophylactic dose (Expert Opinion).iiiLMWH therapy can be maintained for a minimum of 7 days or until the patient is completely mobilized. POCs can be used along with LMWHs at prophylactic doses (Expert Opinion).\n\n3For symptomatic patients with suspected (but unconfirmed) COVID-19 (see Algorithm 4\n):aIf the woman has mild symptoms and requires hormonal contraception, it is recommended that treatment with CHCs is continued, or, alternatively, POC can be used if there is another risk factor (Grade B).bIf the patient has had pneumonia but shows persistent respiratory symptoms that require only outpatient monitoring and self-isolation, the following actions are recommended: iDiscontinue CHCs and use LMWH at prophylactic doses (Grade C).iiIf hormonal contraception is required, it is advisable to switch to POC with the use of LMWH at prophylactic doses (Expert Opinion).iiiLMWH therapy can be maintained for a minimum of 7 days or until the patient is completely mobilized (Expert Opinion).\n\n\n",

Women not using estrogen-based hormonal therapies (MHT or CHC) who are without COVID-19 symptoms should take the preventive and safety measures recommended for the general population.
