            "text": "In plants, small dsRNAs, complementary to both strands of the silenced gene, are generated from a longer dsRNA precursor [20]. RNAs of 21\u201322 nucleotides in length mediate RNAi, whereas longer sequences \u2013 24 nucleotides in length \u2013 have been implicated in chromosomal silencing 21, 22, 23. Processing of dsRNA to small interfering RNAs (siRNA) also occurs in Drosophila embryo and somatic cell extracts 24, 25, 26, 27. These endogenously generated siRNA have a unique dsRNA structure; each strand has a free 5\u2032-phosphate end followed by 19 base pairs (bp) of paired RNA with a two-nucleotide unpaired overhang at the 3\u2032 end (Fig. 1) 24, 28. The search for the enzyme that processes longer dsRNA into siRNA focused on the RNase III family of ribonucleases, whose substrates are duplex RNAs and whose products contain such 5\u2032 ends. A class of evolutionarily conserved RNase-III-like enzymes, containing RNA helicase activity and sharing a common PAZ (piwi\u2013argonaute\u2013zwille) domain, has now been identified in plants and diverse animal species, and has been shown to process dsRNA into siRNA 29, 30, 31. The siRNA-generating enzyme is called Dicer and is believed to act as a dimer. The RNAi machinery might also have other essential cellular functions; for example, deletion of RNAi genes in fission yeast interferes with proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division and maintenance of transcriptionally silenced heterochromatin 32, 33, 34. Participation in important cellular functions could explain why there are no known examples of naturally occurring animal cells incapable of RNAi.",

            "text": "The mechanism of gene silencing induced by siRNA, elucidated in plants, worms and flies, has only just begun to be described in mammalian cells. Initially in worms, RNAi was shown to act after transcription [35]. Using Drosophila embryo lysates, Phillip Sharp and colleagues then showed that silencing occurred via the destabilization of mRNA and suggested that dsRNA might trigger the assembly of a nuclease complex to target homologous RNAs for degradation [36]. The current model suggests that duplex siRNA are first unwound using an ATP-dependent helicase and then one strand of the siRNA is incorporated into a large precursor RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 27, 37. The activated RISC contains a single strand of RNA, a protein homologous to the product of the Argonaute gene family in plants (rde-1 in C. elegans, AGO2 in Drosophila, GERp95 in human cells), and other uncharacterized factors, possibly including the unknown endonuclease responsible for cleaving the target RNA 37, 38, 39, 40. When the RNA in the RISC complex is complementary to a sequence in a target RNA, the RISC complex guides RNA cleavage in the middle of the homologous sequence.",

Long dsRNA, produced in the life cycle of most viruses, activates the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, which phosphorylates the \u03b1-chain of the translation elongation \u03b1initiation factor EIF2\u03b1, blocking all protein synthesis. As part of the antiviral response, activated PKR also induces IFN production and activates RNaseL to degrade RNA. However, because siRNA are only 21\u201325 nucleotides in length, they do not efficiently activate PKR or IFN production, and hence their silencing effects are exquisitely sequence-specific 28, 46.",

These studies have included proof-of-concept studies to silence reporter genes (those encoding green fluorescent protein and luciferase) 6, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 and studies to knockdown gene expression as a rapid probe for gene function (e.g. those encoding tubulin, DNA methyltransferase, lamin A, cadherin, Cdc20 and Cdk2) 6, 52, 54, 57. An ever-increasing number of reports have probed potential therapeutic uses. For example, RNAi has been shown to work in vitro in a variety of conditions: (1) against cancer, by silencing Bcr\u2013Abl, mutated Ras, human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7, activating transcription factor 2, or overexpressed proto-oncogenes such as Bcl-2\n58, 59, 60, 61, 62; (2) against autoimmune diseases, by silencing Fas and caspase-8 63, 64; against neurodegenerative diseases, by silencing polyglutamine sequences [65]; and (4) against viral infections with diverse replication strategies, including respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), HIV, HPV and influenza 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77. Even genes that are highly transcribed, such as those encoding lamin A and tubulin, have been effectively silenced. However, silencing is typically incomplete \u2013 a \u2018knockdown\u2019 rather than a \u2018knockout\u2019 \u2013 with residual gene expression usually at least a few per cent above baseline. Some residual gene expression might be due to untransfected cells in these studies. The studies on HIV successfully targeted a variety of viral genes (gag, rev, tat), as well as the viral long terminal repeat and host cellular receptors (CD4 and CCR5). In rapidly dividing transformed cells, silencing by transfected siRNA lasts for less than a week, but transduced macrophages are effectively silenced for at least three weeks, at least for some targeted genes [78]. siRNA directed against HIV p24 block HIV production only if given within a week of infection, but provide sustained inhibition for at least three weeks in already infected cells.",

However, this specificity could pose problems for therapeutic uses in viral infection, where viral escape from RNAi selection in poliovirus has already been demonstrated [73], although the resistant virus was already present in the infecting inoculum in this study. One way around viral escape is to target more than one gene, either in the virus or by targeting both host and viral genes 68, 78, 79. Moreover, the RNAi mechanism can tolerate some sequence mismatches, particularly away from the middle cleavage site [28]. However, this raises some questions about whether nonspecific silencing of partially homologous genes will present a problem for therapeutic use. In fact, a recent in vitro study showed that some genes with incomplete homology could be partially silenced, an effect that was more pronounced at higher concentrations of siRNA [80].",

These vectors provide a means for in vivo transduction of a variety of cells, including non-dividing cells, and open up a range of possible therapeutic uses for RNAi. The expression plasmids generally use a Pol III promoter and express sense and antisense strands separately or as a hairpin structure 48, 51, 52, 53, 54, 58, 67, 81, 82. In cells, Dicer processes the short hairpin (sh) RNA [sense strand \u2013 short (\u223c5\u20139 bp) loop \u2013 antisense strand; or alternatively, antisense strand \u2013 loop \u2013 sense strand) to an effective siRNA (Fig. 1). Sequences of siRNA expressed from retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been shown to silence expression effectively in a variety of primary cells [including embryonic stem (ES) cells, lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells] 83, 84. Silencing can be controlled by engineering inducible expression of stem\u2013loops [85]. Transfected or infected ES cells have already been used to produce transgenic mice with constitutive or inducible expression of siRNA [83]. However, infection with viral vectors could activate antiviral or inflammatory responses in some cells and interfere with the intended specificity. In particular, a recent study showed that shRNA vectors encoding siRNA, too short to induce an IFN response on their own, can nonetheless induce the expression of genes participating in the IFN response [80].",

            "text": "Although most of these studies have been performed in vitro, often with co-transfection protocols, which might not mimic natural conditions, a few recent studies have demonstrated in vivo silencing using RNAi. For example, rapid injection of duplex siRNA in a large volume (\u223c1 ml) into the tail vein of mice effectively silenced co-injected reporter gene expression 55, 56. However, hydrodynamic injections are difficult to perform reproducibly in mice and require the rapid injection of 10\u201320% of the mouse blood volume. Therefore, it is unlikely that this method could be readily scaled up for clinical use. In the mouse experiments, the reporter gene was efficiently expressed only in the liver and a few other organs, and hence silencing was also demonstrated only in these organs. Hydrodynamically injected duplex siRNA directed against Fas were efficiently taken up by mouse hepatocytes (88%), and effectively silenced endogenous gene expression for ten days without diminution [63]. In vivo silencing in hepatocytes began to wane by 14 days and disappeared by 21 days. Mice with silenced Fas expression were protected from hepatic destruction and death in two models of autoimmune hepatitis (Fig. 2). The livers of Fas-siRNA-treated mice, but not of control mice, were dramatically protected in vivo from treatment with concanavalin A (ConA) or anti-Fas antibody. In the former case, injections of siRNA could provide protection from hepatic fibrosis even when they were initiated after the second of six weekly injections of ConA. Anti-Fas siRNA protected mice from death induced by anti-Fas antibody; all control mice died within three days but 82% of Fas-siRNA-treated mice survived and had normal liver histology ten days later. Many forms of fulminant hepatitis, irrespective of etiology (viral, autoimmune or transplant rejection), are mediated by engaging the Fas receptor on hepatocytes, and hence silencing Fas expression or more distal mediators of apoptosis could be a useful strategy for treating hepatitis more generally. In fact, a recent study, silencing caspase-8 (activated downstream after Fas-receptor engagement), showed protection from both autoimmune and adenoviral hepatitis [64]. In addition, co-transfection by hydrodynamic injection in mice of an HBV plasmid [86] and a plasmid expressing shRNA targeting HBV sequences, processed to siRNA within cells, reduced HBV production and infection of liver cells [76]. Therefore, the potential of RNAi for treating hepatitis by targeting both apoptotic and viral genes has already been demonstrated in vivo.",

In principle, chemically modified siRNA could also be covalently linked to ligands for cell-surface receptors, enabling delivery only to cells bearing these receptors.

Moreover, some modifications of the sense strand, particularly at the 3\u2032 end, are thought not to interfere with gene silencing [90]. Covalently coupling antibodies or ligands for cell-surface receptors to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand should provide a method for targeting siRNA specifically to cells or tissues of therapeutic interest. Covalent or even non-covalent linkage to basic peptides that deliver oligonucleotides into cells, or incorporation of siRNA into liposomes, could also provide a universal delivery mechanism 91, 92. Once inside the cell, duplex siRNA are expected to induce a silenced state that will last for 1\u20133 weeks (at least for cells that are not continuously undergoing cell division). This could be an ideal therapeutic window for many chronic diseases: long enough to require treatment only every few weeks or monthly, and short enough not to raise concerns about the long-term toxicity of permanently silencing a gene. However, introducing oligonucleotides into some non-dividing cells, such as lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem cells, is notoriously difficult and could require special strategies or delivery via viral vectors.",

Nonetheless, it seemed logical to try to harness this mechanism for the control of viral infection, particularly given that the silencing of viral genes is unlikely to have adverse consequences for the host. In searching for sequences to target, those that lack homology to human genes are used. RNAi could be used to treat acute viral infections, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which cause major morbidity and death, or to treat chronic infections that eventually progress. The chronic infections that cause the most morbidity throughout the world are HBV, hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV. Other intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, might also be amenable to RNAi. These are likely to be among the first therapeutic targets investigated.",

For RNA viruses, such as HIV or HCV, any region of the viral genome, including non-transcribed regions and regulatory genes, can also be targeted. It is possible that the RNAi machinery could be a limiting factor in mammalian cells, restricting the number of sequences that can be successfully targeted at the same time within a cell. Nonetheless, to minimize the risk of viral escape mutations undermining RNAi, the simultaneous targeting of several viral and/or host genes that are important at different stages in the viral life cycle might be a useful strategy. Moreover, synergistic enhancement of viral suppression has been demonstrated by targeting more than one gene [78].",

The oncogenic potential of Ras mutation is atypical in that the changing of a single amino acid renders the molecule constitutively active and oncogenic, and hence a small number of different mutations are seen repeatedly in many cancers. As a result, targeting Ras would not need require a customized therapy for each tumor. However, although most of the other types of cancer mutations, such as translocations, occur in fairly well-defined locations, they are nonetheless too diverse to be targeted without sequencing the mutated gene for each tumor that needs to be treated. However, targeting the downstream sequence of a translocated gene, such as an Abl sequence in Bcr\u2013Abl, might be an effective therapy, particularly if the tumor cell could be transfected selectively in vivo.",

Other potential targets for RNAi are growth factors or growth factor receptors that have an oncogenic role in specific tumors. Examples include IL-6 for multiple myeloma and Her-2 for breast cancer.

The possibility of hitting multiple gene targets at the same time also greatly increases the chances of success. The success of RNAi therapy for cancer, as for other indications, will depend in large part on stable and, if possible, tumor-specific delivery. The delivery methods will need to be tailor-made for each type of cancer. For example, for cervical cancer, local instillation of stabilized duplex oligonucleotides could be all that is required. However, for disseminated or hematological tumors, targeting via cell-specific receptors might work better, particularly if the target gene(s) has an essential function(s) in non-transformed cells.",
