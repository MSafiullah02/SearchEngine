            "text": "Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. Methods: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. Results: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively. Conclusion: Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS.",

            "text": "The ongoing outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy [1] [2] [3] . On 30 January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of 10 March, 2020, more than 105 countries, 114,253 cases of COVID-19 and 4000 deaths have been reported all over the world, of which the number of confirmed patients in China has gradually decreased, but is increasing rapidly in other countries, especially in Italy, South Korea, and Iran, and there are lots of doctors engaged in combating it [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three patients in Wuhan Jinyintan hospital and was confirmed as the cause of COVID-19 on January 24, 2020 [6] . After deep examining the full-length genome, we found that the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree [7] and is a new human-infecting beta-coronavirus which had previously not been detected in humans or animals. It is named COVID-19 by the WHO and SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) [8] ; it shares more than 87.99 % identity sequencing with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus, and it shares more than 80 % identity nucleotide with the original SARS epidemic virus [9] [10] [11] . Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells. They are the main target of antibodies and bind with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans in a manner similar to SARS-CoV [12] [13] [14] . However, the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs [15, 16] . At present, research reports that the incubation period in most people range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 5-6 days, but the incubation period may even be as long as 24 days [17] . The reproductive number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2, although still preliminary, is estimated between 2 and 3, suggesting a higher pandemic potential than SARS [18] . Fever or cough may be the major symptom, but asymptomatic individuals have also been identified as potential sources of infection [19] . At present, we think that the new coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact, but transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible [20] . A report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding [21] . Although viral RNA is found in stool, whether it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route still needs to be confirmed by subsequent investigations [22, 23] . Recently, some patients were found to be re-positive after being treated with negative nucleic acid tests twice and symptoms disappeared. It is difficult for us to decrease the severity of COVID-19 owing to the complex structure and unclear physiological mechanism. With the increasing number of confirmed cases, the clinical investigation of patients and antiviral treatment solution has been insufficient, and there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. In order to prove more accurate conclusions on the prevalence of comorbidity and relation of clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with COVID-19, we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm meta-analysis to describe epidemiological, clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, and to compare the severity between diabetes or hypertension and non-diabetes or non-hypertension patients. Our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.",

In the pooled results, comparing the incidence of mortality after excluding the report by Chaolin Huang et al., the heterogeneity decreased significantly (OR = 0.719, 95 % CI = 0.277-1.865, P = 0.497, I\u00b2 = 28 %) and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing the ARDS rate between the two groups; hence, it was regarded as a result of heterogeneity. Likewise, the other studies were considered as the source of heterogeneity because the heterogeneity significantly changed and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing ARDS between the two groups when each of these studies were excluded from the pooled results comparing the incidence of ARDS. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the exclusion of this study would alter the result, and exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis did not substantially influence the results.",

            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. By March 10, 2020, the epidemic had spread to 25 countries around the world. In accordance with the experience of China, surgical masks are in widespread use which is beneficial to prevent the acquisition of COVID-19. In addition, Italy started taking measures to block traffic and lockdown villages. With the rising incidence of COVID-19 all over the world, feasible and effective messaging about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 is greatly needed. Therefore, the focus of this analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms, comorbidity, complications, and different outcomes in China and Singapore. The meta-analysis identified 21 published studies that assessed this proportion. There are few published RCTs because of the rapid development of the epidemic and there are limited medical resources in addition to the presence of uncontrollable risk during treatment. Much of the evidence of effects cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials, such as long-term and rare outcomes. Therefore, we analyzed all retrospective studies in this study. For the main results, we found that the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults, and there is no difference in susceptibility between male and female. Fever is the most common symptom in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the rapid development of severe illness. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. The severity and mortality of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), but the prevalence of COVID-19 is much higher than SARS and the MERS.",

A lot of studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, but there is a lack of studies on the relation of severity and mortality with comorbidity. Similarly, there is no meta-analysis published on complications for patients COVID-19 infected. Therefore, this is a novel systematic review and meta-analysis. Due to the inadequate evidence, we present this metaanalysis by consolidating multiple studies to enable enhanced clinical decision making in the future. We report here a cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, complications and were admitted to the designated hospital. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS, AKI, ACI, or shock and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy.",

First, the studies included in the meta-analysis were not all RCTs. Second, in the literature-included studies, the treatment of every hospital is not completely similar. Third, owing to the treatment by grading of mild, ordinary, and critical, the severity of patients in different hospitals varies greatly. In addition, as the cause and physio pathological mechanism was unknown at the onset of emerging infections, the treatment in Wuhan was only based on clinical experience, leading to a higher complication and mortality. Fourth, partial missing information in a few articles may lead to biased results. We have attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data. Moreover, clinical and methodological heterogeneities were observed in several parameters in the meta-analysis given the variation in intervention techniques, patient composition, and preferences among different cities. True heterogeneity and poor methodological quality could also lead to an asymmetric plot. In the future, larger, higher quality clinical trials should be conducted, and we will conduct a more detailed subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity to obtain a more reliable conclusion and more effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.",

In addition, we found that diabetes and hypertension are closely related to severity and mortality. Improving the protection against COVID-19 in persons with chronic disorders is essential.
