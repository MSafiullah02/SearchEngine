            "text": "Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. Depending on the degree of liver decompensation mortality averages around 20 % [1]. In our own studies, we found an esophageal variceal bleeding-related death rate of nearly 40 % [2, 3], although in-hospital death rate of variceal bleeding has dropped considerably within the last decades [1]. However, a rather high percentage of patients still die before they are admitted. Hence, despite the fact that bleeding is no longer the most frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, preventing bleeding from varices induced by portal hypertension remains a major treatment aim. The natural history of liver cirrhosis induced by chronic viral infection [4] shows an occurrence rate of ascites and hepatocellular carcinoma of around 2 % per year after diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis, while variceal bleeding occurred only in 5 % of patients within a time period of 10 years. Furthermore, bleeding is often more a bystander than a cause of severe liver decompensation. Nevertheless, variceal bleeding is a dramatic event and clinicians have been developing strategies for its treatment and prevention over decades.",

In patients with previous variceal hemorrhage, this hepatic venous portal pressure gradient (HVPG) was nearly always greater than 12 mmHg. Yet, this pressure could in fact represent the threshold for formation of varices rather than serve as a good discriminator for bleeding, since many retrospective studies [14, 15] failed to find significant differences of the average HVPG between bleeders and non-bleeders. Few data exist on the risk of diurnal pressure changes, e.g., induced by meals or physical activity, which can be quite remarkable [16]. Furthermore, portal flow may vary considerably between patients with a similar degree of portal hypertension.",

Techniques to assess liver stiffness are increasingly integrated into ultrasound devices, and future equipments might allow estimation of portal blood flow, spleen size, diameter of the portal vein, as well as stiffness of the liver in one step. It remains to be seen whether these techniques will allow monitoring of the effect of drugs applied to lower portal pressure.",

Blockade of this cascade via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or preventing angiotensin II binding to AT1 receptors attenuates fibrosis and decreases portal pressure [42\u201345]. Chronic administration of these available drugs might therefore play a role in the pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. However, randomized trials are lacking to date. Around 10 years ago, a homologue to ACE, the so-called ACE2, has been described [46]. ACE2 degrades the active angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137, which binds to the so-called MAS receptor. This receptor elicits contrary effects to AT1Rmediated processes; it blunts fibrosis and causes vasodilation. Thus, ACE2-deficient mice show more severe liver fibrosis, while the administration of recombinant ACE2 reduces experimental liver fibrosis [47, 48] and reduces portal hypertension via the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137 by dual effect prevention of AT1R stimulation and increased MAS receptor stimulation. Modulation of this system could also play a future role in pre-primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.",

Five trials compared prophylactic ligation with untreated controls comprising 601 patients. A meta-analysis found a homogenous beneficial effect with respect to reduction of first variceal bleed, bleeding-related mortality, and all cause mortality. Consequently, ligation has become the endoscopic procedure of choice in the prevention of first variceal bleeding [105]. Typically, 2\u20133 sessions of ligation are necessary. The interval between these sessions varies between the groups from 1 to 3 weeks, with 2\u20133 weeks [106] as possibly the best interval for the repetition of the procedure. Although ligation has been shown to be effective for prophylaxis of first bleeding, it has to be kept in mind that the procedure depends on the experience of the endoscopist and that it may induce life-threatening bleeding [2].",

It is believed that the latter phenomenon contributes about one third to the degree of portal hypertension. The speculation by the French group of Clichy that portal tributary blood flow could be reduced by administration of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker was indeed ingenious. The blockade of \u03b21-adrenoceptors decreases the cardiac index and therewith the splanchnic inflow. At the same time, blockade of the \u03b22-adrenoceptors renders \u03b11-adrenergic reaction unopposed within the splanchnic vasculature, which results in vasoconstriction and a further drop in splanchnic perfusion [108]. The decreased splanchnic perfusion and consequently the reduced portal venous inflow achieve\u2014on average\u2014a reduction of portal pressure by 12 % [109, 110]. It is believed that it is mainly this long-term reduction of portal pressure under continuous intake of propranolol that reduces the bleeding risk, as shown consistently in randomized controlled trials [111]. It was suggested early on that propranolol should be dosed up to a reduction of the heart rate by 25 % or the maximal tolerated dose. Once this hemodynamic reaction is achieved, 20\u201340 % of patients [109, 110] show a decrease of HVPG by \u226520 %, which is believed to be the best prognostic sign for prophylaxis success. An analysis of the data of 589 individual patients from four randomized trials [111] showed that the percentage of patients without upper gastrointestinal bleeding increased from 65 % (controls) to 78 % (verum groups) within 2 years. The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding increased from 82 % (controls) to 90 % (\u03b2-blocker). There was a trend in favor of prolonged survival, but this was far from being significant (71 % vs. 68 %, p = 0.34).",

No difference was found in the 1 and 2 year actuarial probability of first variceal bleeding. In further studies, nitrates were inferior to propranolol [119\u2013121] and ligation [119].

Hemodynamic studies [109, 110, 129] showed that a daily dose of carvedilol of 12.5\u201325 mg reduces the average HVPG to a higher relative degree than propranolol (around 19 % vs. approximately 10 %). Accordingly, more patients are responders (drop of HVPG >20 % or to <12 mmHg) with carvedilol when compared to propranolol (54 % and 23 %, respectively) [110], while somewhat more than 50 % of patients, who did not respond to propranolol, still showed an adequate response to carvedilol [109]. This renders carvedilol a potential treatment of choice for bleeding prophylaxis [130]. Yet, no controlled trial on the direct comparison to propranolol for primary prophylaxis has been published to date. Regarding head to head comparison with ligation in the setting of primary prophylaxis, one trial showed a significantly lower first bleeding rate [131] in the carvedilol group (10 %) compared to ligation (23 %), while another trial found no difference [132]. Survival was not different in either trial.",

Here, blunting the activated RAS in liver cirrhosis could be an option as mentioned earlier. One study found a dramatic short-term effect of the AT-1-receptor blocker losartan (25 mg daily), which reduced HVPG by nearly 50 % [136]. Unfortunately, this finding could not be confirmed by further trials [81, 82]. Furthermore, dramatic hypotensive effects in patients with highly activated RAS and kidney failure may be a problem [81, 137]. However, in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis, this approach could be an option for long-term treatment if the dose is carefully titrated. This has been suggested by preclinical studies. In rat models of cirrhosis, low-dose administration of losartan could reduce portal pressure and improve vascular hypocontractility, and finally, renal function [45, 89]. While we found no additional effect when adding irbesartan to low-dose propranolol for reduction of HVPG, sodium excretion increased when we added the AT1-antagonist [138]. Spironolactone has also shown no additive effect in bleeding prevention [139]. Long-term trials with relevant clinical endpoints, such as liver function/histology, bleeding, and survival, are certainly called for.",
