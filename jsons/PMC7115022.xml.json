Over the last 2 decades, the expanding use of high-dose chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in various malignancies has improved the prognosis of patients with HMs at the cost of increased opportunities for severe infections [3\u20135]. Combined with the development of new diagnostic methods and introduction of antiviral drugs, this increased infection rate has rekindled interest in the effects of common respiratory viruses in patients with HMs. These viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in immunocompromised hosts.",

Other viruses that cause respiratory manifestations in many, but not all, patients are considered respiratory viruses because they are often associated with seasonal respiratory events. Examples include Adenoviridae (adenoviruses) and some Picornaviridae (non-poliomyelitic enteroviruses). A separate chapter of this book focuses on newly discovered and emerging respiratory viruses (avian influenza viruses, newly discovered coronaviruses, polyomaviruses KI and WU, human bocavirus, and mimivirus). CMV and Herpes pneumonia will also be addressed by Dr. Chemaly and colleagues in two different chapters in this book.",

The envelope of influenza A and B viruses carries two major antigenic proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA allows the virus to bind to sialic acid-conjugated glycoproteins at the surface of respiratory epithelium cells. NA plays a crucial role in viral dissemination by releasing newly formed virions from host cells. The influenza C envelope supports a unique protein sharing the properties of both HA and NA and known as haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion factor [6]. Influenza B and C viruses can infect humans and some mammalian species, whereas influenza A also infects most avian species [6].\n",

RSV belongs to the Paramyxovirus genus, and PIV 1\u20134 to the Pneumovirus genus, of the Paramyxoviridae family [7]. Their envelopes support two major antigenic surface proteins, one for binding and one for fusion to the cell membrane. Attachment to host cell receptors is mediated by the G protein of RSV and by a haemagglutinin neuraminidase for PIV [7, 8]. The fusion protein F is common to both genera and allows the virus to penetrate within the host cells after binding [8]. Antigenic variations in the G protein determine two major RSV groups, A and B. Antigenic variations also occur in PIV but have less immunological impact [7]. The natural hosts of RSV are humans and chimpanzees, whereas PIV infects only humans [9, 10]. Human MPV is a recently discovered virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family [11]. The human MPV genome and structure are very similar to those of RSV, and both viruses display the same surface proteins [12]. Available data indicate that human MPV infects only humans, although this virus is believed to originate from birds [13].\n",

            "text": "Common respiratory viruses typically cause infections in early childhood. Influenza C usually causes mild infections that lead to the acquisition of protective antibodies capable of preventing recurrences [24]. Influenza A and B are considerably more common and can cause disease of greater severity, most notably in high-risk groups, such as elderly people and patients with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, or immune deficiencies [6]. It is estimated that about 5% of adults and 20% of children experience an influenza episode every year throughout the world [25]. Although most influenza episodes are mild, the high occurrence rate results in a huge burden of disease that has a severe socioeconomic impact [6]. Influenza viruses are believed to be the seventh cause of death in the USA [26]. Influenza A and B infections start in childhood and continue to occur throughout the life span, because antigenic variations affecting HA and, to a lesser extent NA, hamper the acquisition of protective immunity. Two mechanisms of antigenic variations have been described, antigenic drift and antigenic shift [6]. Antigenic drift probably results from the accumulation of point mutations that occur continuously in influenza viruses, with new variants appearing annually or every few years. These new variants replace pre-existing ones by immunological selection and are only incompletely recognised by immunity resulting from exposure to earlier strains. Antigenic shift is a considerably rarer event that occurs only in influenza A and results in a virus with a completely new HA or NA [6]. The result is an influenza pandemic due to the absence of protective immunity against the new virus. Progressive acquisition of immunity against this new strain attenuates the intensity of the epidemic over the following years. The exact genetic mechanisms of antigenic shift are incompletely known, and the emergence of pandemic strains is not predictable. Pandemic strains originate from the recombination of influenza strains circulating in different animal species, including birds, pigs, and humans [6]. Five pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, and the 2009 \u201cMexican flu\u201d pandemic due to the new H1N1 influenza virus is the first pandemic in the twenty-first century [6, 27]. RSV and PIV are typically infections of early childhood [7]. RSV and, to a lesser extent, PIV also undergo antigenic changes that lead to recurrences throughout the life span. These recurrences may be severe, especially in patients with chronic respiratory conditions and in the elderly. The burden of RSV-related diseases may be comparable to that of influenza [28].",

This variability may be explained by disparities in the type of patients enrolled, reasons for screening patients for respiratory viruses and, most importantly, diagnostic methods used. Whatever the exact incidence, one can reasonably assume that attack rates of common respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients are closely related to the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the community, which serves as the viral reservoir for immunocompromised patients [31]. This has been confirmed in recent studies showing that the occurrence of viral respiratory diseases in the enrolled immunocompromised patients paralleled the concomitant viral activity in the community [32, 33]. Accordingly, influenza viruses and RSV are the viruses most commonly identified in the largest cohorts of HM patients, each accounting for about one-third of viral respiratory events [34\u201336]. PIV, Picornaviridae, and adenoviruses come next. It must be pointed out that influenza viruses accounted for a much higher proportion (up to 75%) of viral respiratory events in the study by Martino et al. conducted in the setting of a major influenza outbreak in the community [32].",

Similar to other common respiratory viruses, adenoviruses cause primary infections in childhood, usually during the first few years of life. Adenoviruses may account for 5% to 10% of viral respiratory infections in children [23], and also cause outbreaks in closed and semi-closed populations of young adults such as the military [37, 38]. A distinctive feature of adenoviruses is the ability to cause chronic latent infection by persisting in lymphoepithelial tissues, most notably in the nasopharynx [23]. The epidemiology of adenoviruses in patients with HM has not been the focus of specific studies. Nevertheless, exogenous contamination, by the respiratory or oro-faecal route, may be less important than reactivation of the latent virus [39]. Thus, adenoviral infections in patients with HM may be related chiefly to the level of immunosuppression and, perhaps, to unknown viral factors driving reactivation, rather than to the level of viral activity in the community.",

Since Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and the newly discovered human MPV are mainly diagnosed using reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction technology (rt-PCR), data on their epidemiology are still limited. Recent studies using rt-PCR detection of respiratory viruses in patients with HM revealed a high incidence of human MPV infections, similar to that of RSV infections [30, 36]. In the near future, studies using molecular biology tools may help to clarify the epidemiology of common respiratory viruses and may lead to a radical change in current concepts.",

In the 1990s, the first reports of common respiratory virus infections focused on influenza and RSV [45\u201350]. In these studies, progression to pneumonia occurred in about 75% of patients infected with influenza viruses and 50% of those infected with RSV, and was associated with mortality rates of 25% for influenza and about 80% for RSV. One possible explanation for these striking observations may be a surge of interest in respiratory viral infections in HM patients that led to the publication of the most severe cases. Not surprisingly, these studies had small numbers of patients and high rates of nosocomial infections.",

About one-third of patients develop lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Although less common than in previous reports, influenza-related pneumonia remains a severe condition with a 15\u201330% mortality rate. As in immunocompetent hosts, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is almost always present and often precedes LRTI [32, 49, 51, 52]. URTI can be considered a useful argument supporting the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection in patients with HM investigated for pneumonia [53]. However, the identification of a common respiratory virus does not exclude an associated bacterial or fungal infection. These co-infections are very frequent, occurring in 12\u201325% of cases of influenza-related pneumonia [32, 34, 50]. There are no reports of extra-respiratory manifestations in patients with HM, although myocarditis, pericarditis, myositis, meningo-encephalitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and Reye syndrome have been described in immunocompetent patients [6, 54].",

No clear data on the incidence of concomitant bacterial or fungal infections are available in the literature, and RSV-related pneumonia in patients with HM are often ascribed to viral infection [53]. However, bacterial co-infections were present in as many as 30% of patients in a large study of RSV infections in immunocompetent individuals [55]. Bacterial or fungal co-infection may be more common in patients with HM and must be carefully sought. Non-sustained viraemia may accompany RSV infection, and RSV was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and neurological disorders in two case reports [8, 56].

Epidemiological evidence supports an association of human rhinovirus with LRTI in immunocompetent children and elderly people [68, 69]. Despite growing evidence that human rhinovirus is able to replicate in lower respiratory tract cells in vitro and in vivo [70, 71], whether this virus can cause pneumonia remains debated [72]. Several reports in patients with HM link human rhinovirus to LRTI [73\u201377]. However, these retrospective studies in small patient populations with high rates of pulmonary co-pathogen identification fail to demonstrate a clear role for human rhinovirus in the development of pneumonia. Non-poliomyelitic enteroviruses are chiefly responsible for URTI [16]. Only a few studies with small numbers of patients have focused on these viruses in patients with HM, and no conclusions can be drawn from their results [77\u201380]. Coronaviridae are also principally responsible for URTI but may occasionally cause pneumonia [81]. No studies have evaluated the role of Coronaviridae in patients with HM, and only two case reports have been published [82, 83].",

The only risk factor for virus-related pneumonia found consistently in studies is lymphocytopenia, defined using a variety of cutoffs [29, 32\u201334]. One study found that lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/mL) was independently associated with mortality in patients with influenza-related pneumonia [34]. A higher incidence and greater severity of virus-related pneumonia have been noted in HSCT recipients compared with other patients with HM. This finding may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion. However, in a study by Martino et al., pneumonia rates were comparable in patients with and without lymphocytopenia [32]. The possible higher incidence and greater severity of virus-related pneumonia within the first few days after HSCT, compared with infections occurring later on, may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion [53]. A similar mechanism may underlie the surprising protective effect of corticosteroid therapy in the study by Nichols et al., since this treatment is often given to treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after lymphoid engraftment [33].\n",

            "text": "A distinctive feature of adenoviruses in HM patients is that they may either be acquired via exogenous respiratory or oro-faecal contamination, or arise via reactivation of latent viruses [39, 86]. Adenoviruses cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from benign conjunctivitis to rapidly fatal disseminated disease. In patients with HM, the risk of severe adenoviral disease seems related to the level of immunosuppression. Adenoviral disease has been reported in 3\u201327% of HSCT recipients within the first 100 days after transplantation [87\u201389]. Higher rates may occur in paediatric patients compared with adults [88, 90]. In vivo and ex vivo graft T-cell depletion [86, 87, 91], lymphocytopenia [86], GVHD [87, 89], viral shedding from more than one site [86, 88, 90], and adenovirus viraemia [86, 92\u201394] have been reported as risk factors for severe adenoviral disease. Adenovirus viraemia consistently preceded viral shedding from more than one site in the study by Chakrabarti et al. [86]. This risk factor is of critical importance since it guides pre-emptive antiviral therapy. Adenoviral disease has been chiefly reported in myeloablative HSCT recipients, but has also been described in non-myeloablative HSCT recipients, autologous transplant recipients, and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine combined with CD52 monoclonal antibodies [88, 89]. In allogeneic transplant recipients, the most frequent manifestations of adenoviral infection are gastrointestinal disease and haemorrhagic cystitis [95, 96]. Although haemorrhagic cystitis is a benign localised event, it is associated with high morbidity [90]. It must be pointed out that in a patient with febrile haematuria and adenovirus urinary excretion, the onset of acute renal failure with flank pain may reveal adenovirus nephritis [97]. Gastrointestinal manifestations include gastroenteritis and colitis, which often manifest as febrile haemorrhagic diarrhoea [95, 98]. The most severe manifestations of adenoviral infection are hepatitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia [86, 89, 90]. Adenovirus-related pneumonia occurred in 15 of the 85 patients with adenovirus infection in the study by La Rosa et al. [89]. The pneumonia was isolated in 11 patients and a manifestation of disseminated disease in 4 patients. Bacterial and fungal co-infections were found in 50% of patients, in keeping with other studies [90]. The mortality rate was 73% overall, 50% in patients with isolated pneumonia, and 80% in patients with disseminated disease [89].",

            "text": "A chapter from Dr. Sandherr is dedicated to antiviral therapy in this book. Regarding common viruses, we will briefly describe available treatments on influenza and RSV. Two classes of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza: M2 ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors. The M2 ion channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, act by inhibiting the M2 protein needed for viral RNA release within the host cells. They are active only against influenza A strains. Their clinical effect is limited, being not significantly different from that of a placebo [121], and is further hampered by the worldwide emergence of resistant influenza A strains [122]. The neuraminidase inhibitors (Table 21.3), oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, are sialic acid analogues that competitively inhibit the influenza neuraminidase. Randomised controlled trials showed moderate decreases in symptom intensity and duration with both drugs [123\u2013125]. Neuraminidase inhibitors may also limit bacterial super-infection of the lungs [125, 126]. Early administration of these drugs seems mandatory to obtain a clinical benefit [127]. A more recent cohort study suggested a diminution of 15-day mortality with neuraminidase inhibitors [128]. This result must be interpreted with caution, especially given the study design. There is growing concern about the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A strains [129]. This phenomenon is not surprising given the high mutation rate in the influenza genome. It should lead clinicians to reconsider the indications of neuraminidase inhibitors and their use as monotherapy to treat influenza [130]. No randomised controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in patients with HM. The apparently lower mortality in descriptive cohort studies compared with historical studies must be interpreted with caution [33\u201335, 131]. Many of the patients in these cohorts had bacterial and fungal co-infections, whose specific treatment probably contributed to decreasing mortality. Furthermore, the decision to treat patients was left to clinician discretion, which may have introduced a bias toward selection of patients with greater disease severity. Given both the absence of strong evidence supporting beneficial effects of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy and the rapid emergence of resistant strains, we believe that neuraminidase inhibitor therapy cannot be recommended for HM patients with influenza. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy, safety, and ecological impact of neuraminidase inhibitors in these patients.\n",

The efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin was variable in uncontrolled cohorts of patients with RSV-related pneumonia [34, 46, 132]. Again, the results must be interpreted with caution. Early ribavirin therapy, introduced before the onset of respiratory failure, seemed associated with lower mortality in the study by Whimbey et al. [132]. This observation led some authors to evaluate pre-emptive ribavirin therapy, characterised by ribavirin treatment of RSV URTI to prevent progression to pneumonia [133, 134]. The study by Boeckh et al. is the only randomised controlled trial evaluating pre-emptive ribavirin therapy in patients with RSV infection [133]. Unfortunately, the trial did not enrol a sufficient number of patients to produce conclusions. Intravenous ribavirin has also been evaluated and found unhelpful [29, 135]. Combining ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulins or RSV-specific immunoglobulins produced variable levels of efficacy in cohort studies [35, 132, 136, 137]. Palivizumab, an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody, was evaluated only in a small cohort [138].",

Intravenous ribavirin therapy failed to demonstrate benefits in available studies [89, 142\u2013147]. Cidofovir therapy (Table 21.3) seemed to result in better outcomes in small, uncontrolled series [148\u2013153]. Ganciclovir and antiretroviral drugs, such as zalcitabine, alovudine, and stavudine, exhibit in vitro activity against adenoviruses, but have not been specifically evaluated in clinical settings [95, 154]. Considering the lack of specific antiviral drugs, decreasing the level of immunosuppression seems to be a rational treatment approach [155]. T-cell therapy has also been reported in some small series [155, 156]. Early cidofovir treatment seems associated with a better outcome [151]. Weekly PCR screening for adenovirus viraemia has been suggested to guide pre-emptive cidofovir therapy [91\u201394, 153, 157]. The exact threshold above which pre-emptive cidofovir therapy should be initiated is unknown. Randomised controlled trials are needed to better define the optimal viraemia threshold for antiviral therapy and to evaluate the benefits from this treatment.",

However, nosocomial outbreaks have been described in haematologic wards, often within a few days after an outbreak in the community [31, 43, 44, 46, 158\u2013160]. Preventing nosocomial transmission of common respiratory viruses requires a multifaceted approach (Table 21.4) that targets not only the modes of transmission, but also the source of the viruses [43]. Nosocomial outbreaks are believed to originate from infected patients and from infected health-care workers. Infection control measures include screening symptomatic patients for common respiratory viruses, early isolation of infected patients, screening health-care workers and visitors for respiratory symptoms, and avoiding contact of symptomatic individuals with patients. Most haematologic wards do not allow children to visit patients, as children are highly prone to common respiratory virus infections and may exhibit viral shedding long after symptom resolution [39]. Continual reinforcement of standard hygiene measures, especially hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, is also strongly recommended. Awareness of the usefulness of these measures, and therefore adherence to the measures, are low, but can be enhanced by educational programs [161]. Most of the common respiratory viruses are transmitted by droplets or direct contact of infected secretions with the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva. Indirect transmission via contaminated fomites or devices is also possible, since these viruses may survive several hours on these surfaces [6, 7, 58]. Consequently, contact isolation of infected patients combined with droplet precautions is mandatory [162]. A gown, gloves, and a mask with eye protection must be worn for all contacts with infected patients. Airborne transmission of influenza is suspected [163, 164] but not yet proven, and two recent studies suggest that surgical masks may be as effective in preventing influenza transmission as masks with greater filtration capacity [165, 166]. Infection control measures have not been evaluated in randomised control trials, but a before-and-after study suggests they may help to prevent the transmission of common respiratory viruses [43]. It must be pointed out that asymptomatic viral shedding, when present, limits the effectiveness of infection control measures [30, 65]. The optimal duration of isolation is unknown. Whether isolation should be prolonged in asymptomatic patients with persistent low-titre viral shedding detected only by molecular methods remains unclear. Since adenovirus acquisition is known to result also from endogenous reactivation, adenoviral infections may be chiefly related to the level of immunosuppression [39, 86] and, therefore, may not be effectively prevented by standard infection control measures.\n",

The immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine is lower in patients with HM compared with immunocompetent controls [167\u2013172]. A second dose of influenza vaccine has been proposed to enhance immunogenicity, but this strategy was not beneficial in an open-label randomised study [169, 170]. The timing of influenza immunisation may be important. Immunogenicity may be improved by giving the vaccine at least 6 months after HSCT or at least 7 days after intensive chemotherapy [168, 171]. The efficacy of influenza immunisation has not been evaluated in randomised control trials. However, a retrospective cohort study suggested benefits from influenza immunisation in HSCT recipients [173]. Influenza immunisation appears safe in patients with HM, and lifelong seasonal administration of the influenza vaccine is therefore recommended in these high-risk patients [174]. Importantly, family contacts should be immunised also to prevent transmission within the household. Of critical importance is the issue of health-care worker immunisation, which is known to prevent nosocomial acquisition of the virus [175].",

The pre-emptive treatment of viral URTI has been discussed above.

A retrospective cohort study suggested that this measure might prevent RSV-related pneumonia in patients undergoing HSCT [178].

In these patients, they constitute a common cause of potentially severe pneumonia. However, areas of uncertainty remain, indicating a need for further investigations. The epidemiology of common respiratory virus infections in patients with HM has not been extensively studied. Large epidemiological studies of common respiratory virus infections in patients with HM based on molecular biology tools may lead to radical changes in knowledge. Although it is now clear that common respiratory viruses are responsible for increased pneumonia rates in patients with HM, the exact nature and causative mechanisms of these pneumonia cases remain unknown. Studies are warranted to investigate the role of viruses in the development of these LRTIs. The virus might directly injure alveolar epithelium or promote lung super-infection by causing bronchial epithelium damage. These studies would also help to determine the potential benefit of pre-emptive or curative antiviral therapy. Finally, randomised controlled studies of antiviral therapy in patients with HM are urgently needed.",
