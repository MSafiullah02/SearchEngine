The immune system\u2019s memory response and vaccination have resulted in complete eradication of many diseases. Our immune system is very adaptive and consists of a variety of cells and molecules, which play an active role in protecting us. It not only protects us from the outside pathogenic agents but also is also capable of recognizing the body\u2019s own components. It recognizes them as self and does not induce response against them. It is known as self-/non-self-discrimination. Sometimes due to certain defects or other reasons when the immune system is not able to differentiate self, then it mounts an attack on self-components leading to autoimmunity.",

Lymphocytes (T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes) are involved in adaptive immune responses, and other leukocytes as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells are important cells of innate immunity (Fig. 8.4). They are again divided into granulocytes and agranulocytes [6]. The cells containing granules have a variety of digestive enzymes in them for pathogen clearance, while agranulocytes have other modes of action.\n\n\nNeutrophils: Are called polymorphonuclear cells, take both the acidic and basic stains, are first cells to respond for infections, and are predominant cells involved in inflammation.\nEosinophils: Take up acidic dye eosin. They are cells which respond against parasitic infections. They are phagocytic and also involved in allergic reactions.\nBasophils: They take up basic dye methylene blue and have high-affinity receptors of IgE antibody.

Thus, hapten is coupled to an immunogenic carrier, and hapten\u2013carrier conjugate triggers immune responses for hapten antigens\n, carrier antigens, and new epitopes formed due to hapten\u2013carrier interactions. Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a hapten which cannot elicit antibody response.\nImmunogen: Antigen which is capable of mounting adaptive immune responses. An antigen may or may not be an immunogen, but an immunogen is always an antigen. Immunogenicity is determined by four properties like foreignness, molecular size, chemical composition, and complexity.\nEpitope: Antigenic determinant or epitope is that specific part of antigen which interacts with complementarity-determining region of an antibody. B cell binds surface regions of antigens as they bind directly; however, T cells recognize processed antigen in association with MHC; thus, TCR recognizes hidden or intracellular moieties.\nAntibody: Antibodies are effectors of humoral immune responses. It is a Y-shaped glycoprotein present on B cells as part of its receptor and is also secreted to bind to antigenic determinants. It neutralizes the antigen by activating various immune components. There are five classes of immunoglobulins based upon their effector functions: IgM, IgD (both present on B cell as B-cell receptor), IgG, IgE, and IgA.\nToll-like receptors: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are transmembrane proteins with extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Ten human TLRs have been characterized which play an important role in binding to different PAMPs.\nOpsonization: When any antigenic molecule is surrounded and bound by antibody from all sides, the binding of antibody triggers phagocytic cells to readily phagocytose the antigen; the coated particles or antibodies are known as opsonins and the process is called opsonization (Fig. 8.5a).\n\nAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC): Natural killer (NK) cells express a membrane receptor (CD16) for a specific portion of the antibody molecule, allowing them to attach to the antibody bound with target. Attachment of NK initiates the cascade of events resulting in the destruction of target cell (Fig. 8.5b). Its granules release perforin and granzyme. Pores formed by perforin assist the entry of granzyme which triggers fragmentation of DNA including viral DNA and cell death.\n",

Thus unlike innate immunity which mounts quick response, it takes time. Adaptive immunity is triggered by innate immunity; thus, response is highly interactive with many co-involvements and cooperation to eliminate pathogen effectively. Thus, adaptive immune response can do self-/non-self-discrimination and is highly specific against a variety of pathogens with tremendous diverse memory [6].",

It is due to increase in thermal set point, that is, above the normal body temperature of 97.7\u201399.5 \u00b0F. Fever is a useful defense mechanism, as immune response of the body mediates its response effectively at high temperature. During fever, muscle tone of the body is increased, which presents as chills. Fever is presented by many diseases as tropical or environmental diseases, but one should remember that many common infections like influenza and tuberculosis also occur in the tropics or may be acquired en route to and from. Exotic local febrile patient may also be due to autoimmune or malignant condition. The causes of fever may be bacterial or viral or fungal infections or autoimmune condition or malignancy or folate deficiency:\nPathophysiology: Temperature is ultimately regulated by the hypothalamus; it triggers the fever by inducing pyrogens. The hypothalamus is acted upon by prostaglandin E2, generating systemic response in the body causing heat-creating effect to match a new temperature level.\nPyrogen: Pyrogen is a substance which induces fever; it may be endogenous or exogenous. Exogenous pyrogen may be bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and endogenous pyrogens are various cytokines like IL-1 (\u03b1 and \u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b2, macrophage inflammatory protein \u03b2, interferon-\u03b1, and interferon-\u03b2.\nDiagnosis\nof pyrexia: Diagnosis is made by clinical symptoms as increase of temperature, chills, rigor, and increase in muscle tone. For pattern of temperature, diagnosis is confirmed by blood and serological examination (TLC, DLC, ESR, CRP) or by culture and sensitivity test. Pyrexia is managed by treating the cause and antipyretics [5].\n\n",

Acne is usually treated with azelaic acid (Azelex), salicylic acid preparation, or retinoids. Inflammatory acne resulting in appearance of pustules and papules is caused by Propionibacterium acnes, an anaerobic diphtheroid present on the skin. The treatment for these is phenyl peroxide (available as Benzamycin), antibiotic erythromycin or isotretinoin, or clear light system.\nErysipelas: Appears after Streptococcus pyogenes (gram-positive bacteria) infects the dermal layer of the skin. The disease shows eruption of the skin into reddish patches with raised margins. The risk of this may be its progress to local tissue destruction followed by entry into the blood vessel resulting into sepsis. The treatment is \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\nNecrotizing fascitis: The invasion of streptococci with excessive tissue destruction results in necrotizing fascitis. It might be caused by exotoxin A, which acts as super antigen. The treatment is penicillin.\nImpetigo: Commonly in hospitals, pathogenic strain staphylococci produce enterotoxins, leukocidins, and exfoliative toxins resulting in impetigo of the newborn. Symptoms are thin-walled isolated vesicles that rupture and later crust over. Treatment is hexachlorophene containing skin lotions.\nFolliculitis: Caused by Staphylococcus and the most common skin microbiota. S. aureus enters through the opening in the skin and the hair follicle passage. Infection of hair follicle occurs as pimple on the skin and sty of eyelashes. Serious hair follicle infection is furuncle which is abscess surrounded by inflamed tissue. In case neighboring tissue is invaded, this results in excessive damage (carbuncle) with the symptoms of generalized illness with fever. The invasion of infectious agent to underlying tissue and entry into the bloodstream are serious health risks associated with Staphylococcus infection.\n",

Influenza virus has eight separate RNA segments with inner protein and an outer lipid bilayer. Two types of projections embedded in the lipid bilayer are hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) spikes. H spikes (about 500 on virion) allow the virus to recognize and attach to cells of the body; this causes agglutination of RBCs. N spikes (about 100 per virus) help the virus to separate from infected cells after intracellular reproduction. Antibodies against H spikes are more important in the resistance of body to the disease. Viral strains are identified by variation in H and N antigens. Different forms of antigens are designated as H1, H2, H3, N1, and N2. The different numbers show substantial alteration in the protein composition of spikes which are referred as antigenic shifts, and they escape from the previous immunity developed in the human body. High mutation rates are characteristic of RNA viruses. The major cause of antigenic shifts is genetic recombination which might occur in infections involving more than one strain and mixing of RNA from strains of animals (swine, horses, and birds) with RNA of human strains. Swines may be infected with both human and fowl influenza, and likely animals involved in shifts therefore are referred as mixing vessels [5].",

Quick treatment is required with broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporins.\nTetanus: The disease is caused by an obligatory anaerobic, endosperm-forming, gram-positive Clostridium tetani. The symptoms are due to potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, which affects relaxation of muscles causing muscle spasms. The jaw muscles are the early target which prevents the mouth from opening known as lockjaw [5].Spasms in the back muscle cause the head and heel to bow backward (opisthotonos). Death results from spasms of respiratory muscles. Effective vaccination has reduced the incidences. Both attenuated and subunit (tetanus toxoids) vaccines are available:\nBotulism: The causative agent is anaerobic, endospore-forming gram-positive Clostridium botulinum. Exotoxin produced the most potent of all natural toxins which blocks the release of acetylcholines. The patient undergoes a progressively flaccid paralysis for 1\u201310 days and may die from respiratory and cardiac failure. Botulism toxin is used for cosmetics as Botox.\nLeprosy: Due to infection of Mycobacterium leprae in the peripheral nervous system. The organism was isolated by Gerhard A. Hansen and formally known as Hansen\u2019s disease. It usually invades cells of the peripheral nervous system. Sulfone drugs as dapsone and other drugs as rifampin and clofazimine are effective [5].\nPoliomyelitis: The paralytic form of polio appears in less than 1 % of infected people, whereas majority of the cases are asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms such as headache, sore throat, fever, and nausea. The mode of transmission is through contaminated water and affects the throat (sore throat) and small intestine. The virus enters the lymph nodes and then blood and afterward penetrates the central nervous system. The virus invades and destroys motor nerve cells of the upper spinal cord; sometimes, death can result from respiratory failure. There are three different serotypes of virus. The Salk vaccine uses inactivated polio virus, whereas Sabin is oral polio which is attenuated. The use of vaccination has almost eradicated polio from the population. The use of Sabin/oral polio is not recommended as reversion to virulent state and symptoms in immunocompromised host pose a threat of the disease [5].\nRabies: (Latin, rage or madness) The disease is caused by rabies virus which is transmitted to humans by bite of infected animals (dogs, cats, bats, foxes, etc.). The virus from skeletal muscles and connective tissue moves to CNS where it causes encephalitis. The symptoms are mild and varied and sometimes thought/sight of water can result in fear called hydrophobia. The end stage of disease is due to excessive damage to the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Passive vaccination is preferred as precaution [5].\n",

The lesion, chancre, appears as anogenital ulcer, which can also spread to extra-anogenital sites like the lip, tongue, and tonsils. Secondary syphilis presents itself with rash affecting the palms and sole which later on becomes papules. Tertiary syphilis is manifested with gummatous, cardiovascular, and neurological involvement. Syphilis is diagnosed by identifying treponemes using dark field microscopy or by serological tests. Treatment of choice is intramuscular benzathine penicillin [1\u20134].",

Dysuria which is associated with vulvar herpes or vulvovaginal candidiasis is referred as external as it is painful when comes in contact with urine. Initial evaluation includes urethral discharge, gram staining, and test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Quinolines were given for treatment of gonorrhea as quinolines are a simple, safe, and effective treatment for gonococcal infections of any severity. However, because of growing resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the guidelines suggest treatment with cefixime (Suprax) or ceftriaxone (Rocephin). In the absence of gonococci in gram stain, urethritis treatment is directed toward nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Mycoplasma genitalium is a new etiologic agent added to the list of bacteria that cause nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in addition to Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin in a single dose or doxycycline was recommended for the treatment of NGU.\nVulvovaginal candidiasis: Caused by Candida albicans with symptoms of vulval itching with or without irritation. It is accompanied by vaginal discharge which is clumped, scanty, adherent plaques with white color. Microscopic evaluation reveals leukocytes, epithelial cells, mycelia, or pseudomycelia in 80 % of positive culture. Topical and oral antifungal like miconazole, clotrimazole or fluconazole are given.\nTrichomonal vaginitis: The causative agent is Trichomonas vaginalis with symptoms of vulval itching with discharge which is homogeneous, white or yellow, profuse, and purulent and causes erythema of the vaginal and vulvar epithelium. Microscopic examination reveals leukocytes with motile trichomonads in 80\u201390 % of symptomatic patients. For diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification technology ( NAAT) for T. vaginalis is used and the treatment is metronidazole.\nBacterial vaginosis: Also formerly known as nonspecific vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginosis, various anaerobic or non-cultured bacteria, and mycoplasmas. The symptoms include moderate, white or gray, homogeneous, low viscosity, malodorous discharge. Treatment includes metronidazole and clindamycin.\nNoncervical human papillomavirus: Major infections of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occur annually with sexual transmission. In most patients with genital HPV, the infection is asymptomatic, subclinical, or unrecognized. The disease may be diagnosed by clinical assessment or biopsy of the lesion. The main goal of therapy for noncervical HPV infection is to treat symptomatic visible lesions by applying podofilox (Condylox) 0.5 % solution or gel. There is no evidence that treatment decreases infectivity or changes the natural course of HPV infections or the risk of development of cervical cancer.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Is caused by RNA virus of retrovirus family by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is one of the most important sexually transmitted disease. Its epidemic was recognized long back, and despite major advances in prevention and treatment of the disease, the epidemic continues and has devastating effects on human society. The virus critically attacks CD4+ T cells which are active mediators of cell-mediated immunity. The end stage of the disease is severe acquired immunodeficiency with lots of infection occurring in the HIV patients. The typical case of HIV disease then manifests itself as evidenced by certain malignancies and unusual microbial infections that often attack the lungs, intestines, skin, eyes, or the central nervous system.\n",
