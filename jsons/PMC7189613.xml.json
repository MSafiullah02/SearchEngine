Participation rates in centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes remain suboptimal, despite current national and international recommendations.2 Over the last decade, there have been calls for new strategies to improve participation in cardiac rehabilitation; home- or web-based options have been suggested, several have been trialled and tested,2,3 and some of these approaches have been reiterated in the position paper.1 The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recently endorsed home-based rehabilitation,4 and the updated UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018 guidance on chronic heart failure also stated that \u2018delivery of home-based rehabilitation may increase access and uptake\u2019.5 The flexibility and better adherence of engaging in home-based cardiac rehabilitation are given as reasons for potential benefit.4 There is a surprise omission from the position paper,1 however, of a UK multicentre trial of home-based rehabilitation in heart failure. The findings of the Rehabilitation Enablement in Chronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) study have demonstrated clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness and have been published in this journal.6,7 The British Heart Foundation has just awarded a grant to co-develop a digital version of REACH HF to improve access to rehabilitation to patients with heart failure in the UK.",
