This has contributed to the growth in the use of recombinant proteins for academic research and therapeutic and diagnostic applications as well as in industrial settings (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009, Palomares et al., 2004). The production and purification of recombinant proteins are intimately linked. The choice of host for protein production affects not only the amplification and isolation of the protein, but also the way in which the product can be subsequently purified. The advances in genetic engineering have increased the availability of large amounts of recombinant proteins produced in host cells \u2013 bacterial, mammalian, insect and yeast \u2013 and where Escherichia coli still represents the most widely used platform (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).",

In affinity chromatography, selectivity towards a specific target protein is introduced through the chemical functionalization of the solid support with desired affinity ligands, which can be divided into three main categories: biological, structural and synthetic (Fig. 1(A)) (Roque and Lowe, 2007). Synthetic affinity ligands have been developed in an attempt to overcome disadvantages of natural and structural ligands, by combining the best of two worlds: Molecular recognition features associated with high resistance to chemical and biological degradation and high scalability as well as low production costs and low toxicity (Clonis et al., 2000, Lowe, 2001, Lowe et al., 2001). These have been tailor-made for the purification of specific biomolecules as antibodies (Haigh et al., 2009, Qian et al., 2012, Roque et al., 2005) although they are not regarded as universal purification adsorbents for fusion proteins, and therefore will not be widely discussed in this review.",

Most proteins of interest lack a suitable, specific and robust affinity ligand for capture on a solid matrix. Genetically encoded affinity tags are a viable and common option for the purification of recombinant proteins and also represent important tools for structural and functional proteomics initiatives. This approach requires the existence and availability of specific ligands for the capture of the fusion protein through an encoded affinity tag tail (Fig. 2\n), which can be denominated as affinity \u201ctag-ligand\u201d pairs. Currently available affinity \u201ctag-ligand pairs\u201d fall within one of these categories: Protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013small biological ligands, peptide\u2013protein or peptide\u2013metal chelating ligands.",

Apart from facilitating the purification process, affinity tags can also enhance protein solubility and stability, increase expression levels (Hu et al., 2001, Walls and Loughran, 2011) and allow labelling for cellular localization and imaging studies (Malhotra, 2009). An overview of the main advantages and disadvantages associated with different affinity tags has been already thoroughly discussed in the literature (Arnau et al., 2006, Hearn and Acosta, 2001, Hedhammar et al., 2005, Hu et al., 2001, Malhotra, 2009, Terpe, 2003, Walls and Loughran, 2011, Waugh, 2005, Young et al., 2012). In general, shorter affinity tags (peptides) are more attractive as they are less likely to interfere with the expression, structure and function of the target protein, and their removal can be exempt, decreasing thus the overall costs of the purification process (Hearn and Acosta, 2001, Hedhammar et al., 2005, Terpe, 2003).",

As an example, alkaline phosphatase was fused to SpA and its purification was performed in a single step using an IgG adsorbent, with elution at acidic pH (Nilsson et al., 1985). It is known that SpA presents five homologous domains (E, D, A, B and C) and that IgG binds preferentially to the B domain (Nilsson and Abrahms\u00e9n, 1990). This domain was mutated to improve its resistance towards tag removal by chemical methods and denominated as the Z domain (Nilsson et al., 1987). The bacterial immunoglobulin-binding domain staphylococcal protein G (SpG) has been also studied as a fusion partner due to its bifunctional behaviour \u2013 SpG is composed of different domains (A, B, C and D) with affinity for both IgG and human serum albumin (HSA) (Akerstr\u00f6m et al., 1987, Nygren et al., 1988) \u2013 allowing the purification of SpG tagged proteins through HSA and IgG affinity chromatography (Akerstr\u00f6m et al., 1987, Hedhammar et al., 2005, Nilsson et al., 1997, Nygren et al., 1988).",

            "text": "The FLAG tag technology is quite popular for purification purposes, and has been successfully employed on the purification of several recombinant proteins such as immunoglobulins, cytokines and gene-regulatory proteins. The FLAG tag is a hydrophilic peptide with the sequence DYKDDDDK possessing high affinity for the monoclonal antibodies M1 and M2 (Einhauer and Jungbauer, 2001). As the binding between the FLAG tag and M1 adsorbents is calcium dependent, the elution of bound tagged protein can be carried out under mild conditions in the presence of metal chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), at the expense of risking calcium co-elution. On the contrary, elution from M2 resins usually requires a decrease in pH, which in some cases can be detrimental for the protein of interest (Allen et al., 2003, Prickett et al., 1989). An attractive feature of FLAG tag technology is the possibility of simultaneous purification and removal as enterokinase recognizes the DDDDK sequence (Einhauer and Jungbauer, 2001, Hopp et al., 1988). Lately, two additional FLAG sequences were added in tandem to the original FLAG tag, the triple FLAG tag (3 \u00d7 FLAG), which showed an increased detection limit of the target protein, favoured binding to the M2 antibody, and the possibility to recover the protein by competitive elution with 3 \u00d7 FLAG peptide (Hernan et al., 2000). The 3 \u00d7 FLAG technology has been employed in the purification of a bioactive metabolite (Ueda et al., 2011) and full-length human huntingtin (Li et al., 2006).",

This gentle elution protocol, when compared to other immunoaffinity chromatography methods, contributes to the maintenance of the biological activity and structural integrity of the eluted target protein (Thompson et al., 2009).

Softag 1 is a thirteen amino acid sequence near the C-terminal of the \u03b2\u2032 subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase which can be recognized by the PR-mAb NT73 (Thompson et al., 2003a, Thompson et al., 2003b). This epitope tag is not conserved in all bacterial species. Other PR-mAb's such as 8RB13 were used for the purification of Shewanella oneidensis core RNA polymerase with high yield and purity (Probasco et al., 2007).

            "text": "Another important group of biological affinity ligands includes streptavidin. Here, the tag-ligand system is based on the selective natural binding pair avidin\u2013biotin with a dissociation constant of 10\u2212 15\n M (Bayer and Wilchek, 1990). The first reported tag with affinity for streptavidin was Strep-tag, a nine amino acid peptide selected from a random peptide library (Schmidt and Skerra, 1993), generally fused to the C-terminal of the target protein. According to structural studies, this affinity tag binds to the same pocket as biotin (Schmidt et al., 1996). The main advantages of Strep-tag are related to the resistance to proteolysis in vivo, the lack of interference with expression in E. coli and the mild elution conditions employed which include competitive elution with a biotin or analogue compound such as iminobiotin (Schmidt and Skerra, 1993). However, a limitation of the Strep-tag system is the restriction to C-terminal fusion, and an improved version was developed and termed Strep-tag II with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 37 \u00d7 10\u2212 6\n M (Schmidt et al., 1996). Another engineered streptavidin chromatographic support (Strep-Tactin) was developed for improved binding capacity towards Strep-tag II. This new version of streptavidin was generated from random mutagenesis on the amino acids 44\u201347 located at the flexible loop region near the binding site (Kornd\u00f6rfer and Skerra, 2002). Although the affinity pair Strep-tag II\u2014Strep-Tactin has been extensively used, affinity tags with higher affinity for streptavidin matrices were still investigated: The streptavidin-binding peptide (SPB) tag comprising a 38 amino acid sequence with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u2212 9\n M was selected from a peptide library screened against immobilized streptavidin (Keefe et al., 2001); A Nano-tag combines the small size of Strep-tag II and presents a nanomolar dissociation constant of 4 \u00d7 10\u2212 9\n M for binding to streptavidin (Lamla and Erdmann, 2004). The latter is a 15 amino acid peptide selected from a synthetic library based on the heart fatty-acid binding protein by ribosome display (Lamla and Erdmann, 2003). The AviD-tag is another affinity tag based on the Strep-tag that displays affinity for neutrAvidin, a neutral form of avidin (Gaj et al., 2007). The AviD-tag is composed by a 6-amino acid cyclic peptide selected through phage display with a dissociation constant of 12 \u00d7 10\u2212 6\n M for both neutrAvidin and avidin (Gaj et al., 2007).",

Glutathione acts as the ligand and the complementary GST tag acts both as a purification anchoring point and as a solubility/stability enhancer, which justifies the popularity of this affinity pair system (Frangioni and Neel, 1993, Smith, 2000). In addition, GST resins are cost effective and the elution conditions are mild as reduced glutathione can be employed as a competitive agent (Smith and Jonhson, 1988). However, if reducing conditions are not guaranteed, the fusion protein can undergo oxidative aggregation due to the existence of four cysteine residues exposed at the surface of GST tag (Kaplan et al., 1997).

Fusion proteins containing the MPB tag fused on the N-terminus can be purified in one-single step using a cross-linked amylose affinity resin (Guana et al., 1988).

In addition, the MBP tag is an extremely efficient solubilizing agent when compared to GST and thioredoxin (Trx) (Kapust and Waugh, 1999), and does not contain cysteine residues and thus does not interfere with disulfide bonds of the target protein (Guana et al., 1988, Waugh, 2005).",

For the particular application of fusion protein expression and purification, smaller domains are preferred. Cellulosic supports are commercially available in a wide range of geometries including fibres, beads, membranes and hydrogels, with a diverse range of porosities and functionalities. Chitin binding domains present high affinity for chitin, the second most abundant polymer after cellulose, and are part of the enzymes involved in the biodegradation of chitin and chitosan (Kurek et al., 2009). Starch binding domains have also been explored as affinity tags.

            "text": "The most implemented structural ligands are metal chelates complementary to the His-tag (6 \u00d7 His). Purification of the fusion protein is performed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) which has been comprehensively reviewed in the literature (Block et al., 2009, Charlton and Zachariou, 2007, Cheung et al., 2012, Gaberc-Porekar and Menart, 2001, Porath, 1992). The concept of IMAC was developed by Porath and co-workers in 1975, through the exploitation of the affinity between proteins and heavy metal ions (Zn2 +, Cu2 +, Ni2 +), in particularly zinc and copper metal which strongly adsorb polypeptides containing histidine and cysteine residues in aqueous solutions (Porath et al., 1975). Based on this principle, the same authors coupled iminodiacetic acid (IDA) on to agarose to bind metal ions and further chelate proteins through histidine and cysteine residues (Porath and Olin, 1983). Later, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), another highly stable quadridentate chelating adsorbent, was found to bind strongly to Ni2 + and Cu2 + and to further chelate adjacent histidine residues (Hochuli et al., 1988). NTA technology was then reported for the production and purification of a recombinant protein. The hexapeptide 6 \u00d7 His was genetically fused to the N-terminal of mouse dihydrofolate reductase protein, produced in E. coli and then purified by IMAC using a Ni2 +-NTA adsorbent. Subsequently, protein elution was attempted by pH gradient (pH 8\u20135) in the presence of denaturing agents (e.g. guanidine-HCl), and the tag was further removed by carboxypeptidase A cleavage (Hochuli et al., 1988). However, the major drawback of this pioneer purification study was the employment of denaturing conditions, which triggered the improvement of the procedure by conducting binding under native conditions and elution with low concentrations of a competitor imidazole or EDTA (Janknecht et al., 1991, Westra et al., 2001).",

The main disadvantage of IMAC adsorbents is the metal leaching that contributes to end-product contamination and additional steps of purification with increased costs. In addition, IMAC adsorbents can bind to native histidine patches in proteins or to other amino acids (glutamic and aspartic acid, tyrosine, cysteine, arginine, and methionine) resulting in low selectivity. Other disadvantages are related to evidence that the imidazoyl side chain groups of histidine can interfere with protein expression and folding and also mask the biological activity of the protein (Hearn and Acosta, 2001). Nonetheless, the universe of applications for the IMAC/His-tag system is widely used for protein purification and is extended to matrix-assisted refolding (Dashivets et al., 2009), detection and immobilization, protein microarrays (Kato et al., 2005, Wegner et al., 2003, Wilson and Nock, 2002), and to the development of other affinity tag technologies.",

Novel metal chelating agents based on 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) complexed with Ni2 + were developed in an attempt to overcome the limitations of conventional IMAC matrices such as leaching, and lack of stability and selectivity (Mooney et al., 2011). The respective affinity tags correspond to random heptapeptide sequences displaying multiple histidine, tryptophan, and/or tyrosine residues selected from a phage display library (Mooney et al., 2011). The selected peptide tag (HHHNSWD) was fused to the N-terminal of green fluorescent protein (GFP), produced in E. coli and then purified under physiological conditions with high salt concentrations.

The polyarginine-tag (polyArg) is such an example and consists of six arginine residues with high retention on cationic exchange resins. A great advantage of using cation-exchange chromatography for the purification of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is that most host proteins are neutral or acidic, which can contribute to the reduction of non-specific interactions at physiological and alkaline pH values (Gr\u00e4slund et al., 2000, Hearn and Acosta, 2001). The first reported example was the production and two-step purification of human urogastrone fused to the polyArg tail. The tagged protein eluted under a NaCl linear gradient at alkaline pH, with 44% yield and purity higher than 95% (Sassenfeld and Brewer, 1984). The polyArg-tag has also been successfully employed for on-column refolding studies of tagged proteins produced as inclusion bodies (Kweon et al., 2004, Stempfer et al., 1996). However, the polyArg-tag/cation-exchange resins affinity pair shows low selectivity and the tag promotes aggregation of the protein due to charge\u2013charge interactions (Hedhammar et al., 2005). Poly-anionic affinity tails from one to eight glutamic residues were used for the anion-exchange chromatography based purification of functional human growth hormone (Dalboge et al., 1987) and virus-like particles (Stubenrauch et al., 2000) produced in E. coli. Negatively charged affinity tags based on aspartate residues also yielded stable fusion proteins with unaltered activity (Zhang et al., 2001).",

Due to its excellent properties, the Zbasic was explored for matrix assisted refolding of fusion proteins solubilised with chaotropic agents after being produced as inclusion bodies. The Z domain was also on the basis of Zacidic, engineered to be negatively charged and therefore to be purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Hedhammar et al., 2004).",

Recently, a novel pair based on the covalent linkage between a tag and a synthetic ligand has been developed. This novel system is composed by the Halo-tag and a chloroalkane linker. The Halo-tag was rationally designed based on a bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase (DhaA) derived from a Rhodococcus spp. to bind covalently to synthetic ligands with a chloroalkane linker. Halotag7 appeared as an improved version of Halotag created to enhance protein expression, solubility and structural compatibility but with the same ability to bind covalently and irreversible to a chloroalkane linker (Ohana et al., 2009). The covalent bond formed between the Halo-tags and the linker is highly specific, irreversible, stable and occurs rapidly under physiological conditions, which facilitates the attachment to a variety of molecules or solid surfaces containing diverse functional groups (Los and Wood, 2006, Los et al., 2008, Ohana et al., 2009). These properties were therefore explored in protein labelling technology for cell imaging and protein analysis (Los et al., 2008), immobilization (Taniguchi and Kawakami, 2010) and purification of recombinant proteins (Chumanov et al., 2011, Ohana et al., 2011). However, the formation of covalent bonds between the tag and the ligands makes the re-use of the solid support difficult, which is particularly problematic in protein purification.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins in bacterial hosts can lead to the formation of protein aggregates with unfolded or partially folded structures (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009, Lange and Rudolph, 2008), termed inclusion bodies (IBs) (Garc\u00eda-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2012). When these proteins are fused to solubility tags, solubility is improved during protein expression, although the mechanism is not fully understood (Walls and Loughran, 2011, Waugh, 2005, Young et al., 2012). Thioredoxin A (TrxA) (Katti et al., 1990), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) (Li and Hochstrasser, 1999, Marblestone et al., 2006), and N-utilization substance A (NusA) (Gusarov and Nudler, 2001, Liu and Hanna, 1995) are examples of widely employed tags with the purpose of increasing the solubility of the fusion partner rather than acting as a handle for further purification. As a consequence, a purification tag must be also added to the fusion partner to facilitate purification through affinity chromatography. The TrxA is a small (12 kDa) oxido-reductase protein with intrinsic thermal stability, solubility and robust folding properties that when fused to a target protein contributes to high yields of soluble protein (LaVallie et al., 1993, LaVallie et al., 2000). The SUMO protein (11 kDa) is involved in post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, enhances solubility and stability of the binding partner when fused to the N-terminal (Marblestone et al., 2006), and allows simultaneous cleavage as it is recognized by the SUMO protease (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ulp1) at the conserved dipeptide glycine\u2013glycine (Li and Hochstrasser, 1999). However, when used in eukaryotic hosts, the affinity tag can be cleaved due to the presence of SUMO proteases in vivo (LaVallie et al., 2000, Malakhov et al., 2004). The NusA is a 55 kDa transcription elongation and anti-termination factor, also known to increase the solubility of fusion proteins, however due to their large size can contribute to a high metabolic burn for the host cell (Harrison, 2000).",

Examples of combinations of affinity tags comprise a tandem histidine and FLAG epitope tag for the purification of a Candida albicans septin complex, a complex of cytoskeletal proteins (Kaneko et al., 2004). In addition, combinations of S-tag and Strep-tag II separated by HRV 3C protease cleavage were used for the isolation of protein complexes such as immune cell proteins, adhesion and degranulation promoting adapters (ADAP) (Lehmann et al., 2009). Other examples enclose combinations of streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) and calmodulin-binding peptide as TAP tag to isolate and identify proteins directly from Parkin (ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)), a protein involved in Parkinson's disease (Davison et al., 2009). A novel TAP tag has also been developed, SF tag, and consists of a combination between a doublet Strep-tag II and a FLAG tag. This TAP tag can offer several advantages over the others such as the four fold size reduction (4.6 kDa) with better purity and recovery yields. The main applications of this are related to isolation of protein complexes from eukaryotic cells (Gloeckner et al., 2007, Gloeckner et al., 2009). More recently, a novel N-terminal TAP tag denominated as CHiC tag was constructed based on a combination between His-tag and a choline binding domain followed by a cleavage site specific for TEV protease with applications on protein purification (Stams\u00e5s et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Membrane proteins are embedded in the lipid layer on cell surfaces, playing an important role on several basic cell functions (e.g. signal transduction, cell\u2013cell communication). These proteins are highly relevant for structural and functional studies, however their production and purification strategies are still a challenge. This is related to the fact that membrane proteins are produced with low yield in common hosts (e.g. mammalian and insect cells) (Lin and Guidotti, 2009, Smith, 2011). Due to their hydrophobic character, membrane proteins have the propensity to fold incorrectly and aggregate (Lin and Guidotti, 2009, Smith, 2011). Moreover, the fact that these proteins are within the lipid layer obliges the use of detergents to enhance their solubilization in aqueous systems, which influences the purification step due to detergent interference in ion-exchange and hydrophobic chromatography (Lin and Guidotti, 2009, Smith, 2011). Tagging systems have been studied to overcome the reported limitations. Affinity tags are usually placed at the C-terminal to minimise interference with the membrane targeting process (Lin and Guidotti, 2009). Examples include a combination between the Sumo technology and His-tag for the purification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus membrane protein (SARS-CoV). This strategy addresses solutions for the improvement of expression yields in bacterial hosts by using a solubility enhancer tag; the His-tag allows the purification of target membrane proteins through the IMAC technique with a high tolerance for the presence of detergents (Zuo et al., 2005).",

It has been reported that as the length of the tag increases, a negative effect on cellular growth, stability of the plasmids, secretion efficiency of the target protein and a decrease of recovery yield on purification stage are observed (Lienqueo et al., 2008). According to Coll\u00e9n et al, during protein expression, fully exposed hydrophobic tags can reduce target protein solubility, compromising the secretion pathway and leading to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates (Coll\u00e9n et al., 2001) and the chance that the target protein will be membrane-associated increases (Fexby and B\u00fclow, 2004). Additionally, it was found that tags with higher tryptophan content in the peptide (n = 6) are more prone to proteolytic cleavage when produced in E. coli and fungi hosts (Coll\u00e9n et al., 2001). Therefore, different combinations comprising tyrosine and proline (YP)n have been exploited, as tyrosine presents a less hydrophobic character than tryptophan. Fexby et al have developed a peptide tag with three tyrosine and proline residues fused to GFP which increased protein expression and protein recovery yield by ATPS based purification. The main advantages of using hydrophobic tags with APTS systems rather than with affinity chromatography based methods rely on the combination of rapid separation and high capacity with inexpensive costs (Fexby et al., 2004).",

OBs are spherical structures that contain a triacylglycerol (TAG) matrix surrounded by a phospholipid mono-layer and several proteins, mainly oleosins, caleosins and steroleosins (Bhatla et al., 2010, McLean et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2004, Roberts et al., 2008). Oleosin, the main structural protein of the oil bodies's membrane, acts as an affinity tag. Oleosin fusion proteins have been produced in plants, which also presents several advantages over bacterial hosts such as simple handling, cost-effectiveness and easy scalability, as well as effective polypeptide folding (Bhatla et al., 2010). However the main disadvantages of this host are related to regulatory demands and production time (Wilken and Nikolov, 2012). Oleosin fusion proteins are targeted to naturally occurring OBs in the seed, and purified by several washing/centrifugation steps, as the OBs along with oleosin fusion protein are easily separated by floating (Bhatla et al., 2010, Roberts et al., 2008). Examples of proteins purifed by this technology include recombinant human insulin, revealing a high protein recovery (Nykiforuk et al., 2006). Apart from naturally occurring oil bodies, artificial oil bodies were also successfully employed for the purification of oleosin fusion proteins expressed as insoluble aggregates in E. coli. In these cases, artificial oil bodies were reconstituted by assembling triacylglycerol (TAG) phospholipid and the insoluble recombinant protein. The recombinant fusion protein can be incorporated at the phospholipid monolayer of artificial oil bodies (AOB) through oleosin whilst the target protein is exposed at the AOB surface, where the target insoluble protein undergoes spontaneous refolding. Afterwards, the fusion protein on the surface of AOB can be easily purified by a flotation centrifugation step. The tag can be then cleaved by enzymatic methods or it can be used whilst still fused with oleosin for further applications (Bhatla et al., 2010). This non-chromatographic strategy based on AOB was employed for the purification of GFP (Peng et al., 2004), nattokinase (Chiang et al., 2007) and hydantoinase (Chiang et al., 2005) with high yield and purity.",

Below transition temperature (Tt), ELPs are highly water soluble whereas at temperatures higher than Tt, they aggregate and become insoluble (Floss et al., 2010, Hassouneh et al., 2012, Meyer and Chilkoti, 1999). Due to their unique properties, ELPs have been used as tags, and therefore successfully employed on purification of recombinant fusion proteins (Banki et al., 2005, Meyer and Chilkoti, 1999). The purification of ELP fusion proteins can be carried out through a simple method termed inverse transition cycling (ITC), which allows the purification of fusion proteins by cycling the crude lysate through the insoluble and soluble phases (Hassouneh et al., 2012). Factors such as higher ionic strength, polymer concentration and length can decrease LCST as well as significant hydrophobic surface areas on the target protein. On the other hand, a higher charged surface area can increase LCST (Hassouneh et al., 2001).",

This simple strategy comprises cycles of \u201chot spin\u201d and \u201ccold spin\u201d, differing mainly in the temperature at which the centrifugation step is performed. The \u201chot spin\u201d is related to the centrifugation step performed after the aggregation of ELP fusion proteins from cell lysate. Aggregation can be triggered by an increase of temperature above Tt or an increase of salt concentration to decrease Tt; the increase of salt concentration is usually preferred due to protein denaturation. This step allows the separation of soluble host protein contaminants and recovery of the pellet containing the insoluble ELP fusion protein which is further used on the following step termed \u201ccold spin\u201d. This step consists of the transition of the ELP fusion proteins to a soluble form by dissolving the pellet at low temperature and ionic strength buffer so that the insoluble contaminants can be further removed by centrifugation. The supernatant will contain the purified ELP fusion protein (Hassouneh et al., 2001, Hassouneh et al., 2012). The number of ITC rounds depends on the properties of the target protein and final purity desired. This sample methodology has been already extended for the purification of several recombinant proteins (Table 3\n).",

The hydrophobin classes I and II do not present as much identity in terms of amino acid composition but present the same pattern of eight conserved cysteine residues (Linder, 2009). In terms of aggregates solubility, class I forms more stable aggregates than class II and therefore, in the first case, the aggregates are only able to dissociate under the presence of strong conditions (e.g. formic acid and trifluoroacetic acid) whilst the aggregates formed by class II hydrophobins are much easier to dissolve with aqueous diluted organic solvents (Linder et al., 2005, Mustalahti et al., 2013).",

ZERA has been exploited as a fusion partner for the production of fusion proteins as well as for protein body inducer in order to facilitate further steps of purification (Torrent et al., 2009). This strategy was extended not only to plant based hosts but also in eukaryotic hosts (mammalian and insect cells or filamentous fungi).

            "text": "For most applications, affinity tags are innocuous and do not interfere with the structure and biological function of the target protein. However, for therapeutic proteins there is a demand for tag cleavage to avoid immunological responses and to guarantee authenticity of the protein structure. The removal of the affinity tag can be performed by enzymatic cleavage or harsh chemical treatments and has been extensively reviewed (Arnau et al., 2006, Hearn and Acosta, 2001, Terpe, 2003, Waugh, 2011). Chemical cleavage methods mostly used involve cyanogen bromide or hydroxylamine treatments, which are an inexpensive option but with low specificity and stringent conditions detrimental to the protein. Therefore, enzymatic methods are usually preferred as they operate under milder conditions and present higher selectivity as endoproteases recognize specific amino acid sequences or motifs. The main endoproteases used for tag removal comprise enterokinase (Choi et al., 2001), tobacco etch virus (TEV) (Dougherty et al., 1988) Factor Xa (Jenny et al., 2003), thrombin (Chang, 1985, Jenny et al., 2003) and SUMO protease (Li and Hochstrasser, 1999). An attractive feature of enterokinase and factor Xa is that after cleavage there is no additional amino acid residues on the protein structure, contributing to an intact end product (Choi et al., 2001, Hearn and Acosta, 2001, Jenny et al., 2003). The main limitations in the use of proteases are related to the tag incompatibility under certain cleavage conditions (e.g. buffers, temperature), thus influencing its operation, and accessibility to the cleavage site (Waugh, 2011). The high costs associated with proteases limit the scalability of the purification process (Fong et al., 2010). Strategies on the reusability of these proteases without efficiency loss have been studied, as recently reported for the immobilization of enterokinase onto magnetic supports (Santana et al., 2012).",

Self-cleaving tags have emerged as an alternative strategy for tag removal as they possess inducible proteolytic activity, thus representing an extremely interesting class of affinity tags (Fong et al., 2010, Li, 2011). When combining with a purification tag, the recombinant proteins can be purified with the successive tag removal in a single step. Moreover, the use of self-cleaving tags can simplify the entire process at reduced costs, considering that the use of additional steps is not required for the separation of the target protein from the protease and the affinity tag (Wang et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The intein-based system is a well-established example where purified fusion protein cleavage can be induced by thiols such as \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), or by a shift in pH or temperature (Fong et al., 2010, Li, 2011). The pH-induced inteins are usually fused on C-terminal and are preferred in terms of costs and minor interference with the target protein over the N-or C-terminal thiol-induced intein. This is related to the fact that the presence of thiol groups can disrupt disulfide bonds and therefore confine the purification of the target protein (Fong et al., 2010). The pH-induced inteins combined with ELPs have been involved on a non-chromatographic purification scheme of several proteins, among them GFP (Wu et al., 2006), \u03b2-lactamase (Shi et al., 2013) and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) (Liu et al., 2012) with further tag removal under mild conditions with a pH shift for 6.0\u20136.5. Apart from ELPs, the pH-induced inteins were also fused to chitin binding domain (CBD) for standard affinity chromatography purification via intein-mediated cleavage under the same mild conditions. This strategy has been employed for different proteins such as human antibody fragments, E. coli maltose binding protein (Wu et al., 2011) and human epidermal growth factor (Esipov et al., 2008). On the other hand, examples of thiol-induced inteins have been reported in the literature as fusion partners of oleosin for purification and removal of xyalanase (Liu et al., 2008) and hydantoinase (Chiang et al., 2007). The oleosin fusion proteins were purified through AOB and then released from oleosin by using 40 \u03bcM DTT.",

Non-chromatographic affinity tags are attractive choices as they can easily overcome the drawbacks associated with the affinity tag and therefore present high potential as large-scale purification platforms. However, the main limitation of unconventional fusion partners is the low purity of the recovered target protein when compared with the standard affinity tags commonly employed.",

The fusion protein is expressed in the selected host and (iii) purified by different methods. The most conventional method involves the use of affinity chromatography, where protein capture is performed through the molecular recognition between the tag and the ligand. An alternative method for the purification of fusion proteins is based on ITC, which exploits the reversible soluble\u2013insoluble phase transition behaviour of the affinity tags and the desired fusion protein yield can be achieved with n ITC rounds. Afterwards, in both methods, the tag can be removed leading to a pure target protein.",
